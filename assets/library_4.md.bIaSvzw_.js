It discusses the role of sanctions as a foreign policy tool. Nephew argues about interpreting targets' responses to sanctions based on two critical factors: pain and resolve. When sanctions have achieved maximum effectiveness that lies in the application of pain against a target, but targets may have significant resolve to resist, tolerate, or overcome this pain. The author believes that sanctions have achieved maximum effectiveness resulted Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Richard Nephew is an adjunct professor and senior research scholar and program director at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy since 1 February 2015. He also was serving as the lead sanctions expert for the U.S. team negotiating with Iran between August 2013 to December 2014. The book has been used as a guideline among the high level U.S. politicians since it was published. The book was translated to Persian in Iran in mid 2018. Synopsis Governments, international organizations and nations are increasingly turning to sanctions as a foreign policy tool. Sanctions will lose their efficiency, changing the behavior of the target entity, if they are used without a clear strategy. \\"The Art of Sanctions\\" offers a series of acts that can improve the efficiency of sanctions, such as a framework for planning and applying sanctions. Nephew introduces sanctions as a strategic tool in U.S. foreign policy and explains them as an art whose efficacy depends on decision makers' creativity and their manipulation of using the economic, social and political tools as the sanction's tools. Nephew illustrates that export of many usual goods to the target country are prohibited during the sanction regime; the exporting of luxury goods can destroy the social's sense. For example, the rise in chicken prices in Iran, a good that has not sanctioned, increased the pressure of sanctions among Iranian or exporting some goods to Iran evacuated the Iran's foreign currency reserves. Pain and resolve are two key variables of sanctions; the relationship between a target's ability to resolve the pain and pressure of the sanctions is the most important factor for politicians. Nephew believes the efficacy of sanctions relies on the use of pain against a target, while the target may decide to resolve, resist or deactivate this pain. Finding the role of pain and resolve is important in using sanctions successfully and humanely. Considering these two factors and finding their sensitivity during the sanction's course helps policy makers or politicians to calibrate, ease or remove the sanction's pressure. Reception Daniel Fried, a former U.S. diplomat, wrote about the book; \\"Nephew has manipulated a practical book about the sanction. Everybody who [is] concerned about North Korea, Russia and Iran, should read this book.\\" Robert Einhorn, a former senior adviser of the U.S. State Department's Nonproliferation Bureau and a member of the Brookings Institution, wrote; \\"Nephew has written an interesting book according his experiences as an American negotiator and sanction's plan creator. Sanctions have become a critical tool for U.S. foreign policy system and this book must be read by governors and experts who work on North Korea, Iran and Russia. The book is a great guide for [those] who want to create sanctions against the countries that challenge our national security, too.\\" Dennis Ross, an adviser to Barack Obama, said Nephew's \\"viewpoints and conclusions are highly valuable, and can help many policy makers, too\\". Failure of US sanctions strategy against Iran Richard Nephew writes in this book about the failure of the US sanctions strategy against Iran: Americans after the imposition of active sanctions (between years 1996 - 2004) found that in addition to oil and gas, industries such as petrochemicals, automobiles and consumer goods were most affected by the sanctions. Accordingly, sanctions were imposed on Iran's petrochemical sector during the year 2010, including the import of gasoline to Iran, but the strategy failed soon, because the Iranians began to optimize fuel consumption, which led to reduced consumption. Also they increased fuel production (gasoline and diesel) in their refineries. By this way they succeed in circumventing the petrochemical and gas boycott strategy. Significant Consequences of the imposition of sanctions on crude oil exports in years 2012 and 2013 The author believes that these sanctions have led to the development of Iran's non-oil sectors, particularly the cement sector. Thus, the government was immune from some of the effects of the oil sanctions, as the government tried to find new opportunities in the market for its unauthorized products. In fact, Iran was able to increase its presence and its non-oil goods directly in these markets through sanctions, which limited the country's ability to export one commodity, leading to Iran's ability to expand into other commodities. So here, beyond demonstrating perseverance, Iran has also been able to get through the sanctions. Psychological war on sanctions Richard Nephew points out in the book that the psychological warfare of sanctions has had more impact on sanctions than on the implementation and enforcement of sanctions. Somewhere in the book, he says, the psychological war on Iran, in addition to playing a key role in advancing American action, is aimed at making wrong decisions by Iranian statesmen in addition to creating despair and frustration among the Iran's people.

San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, page 179. Plot summary Thomas Otterburn, a shy, mild-mannered engineer, lets himself be talked into becoming the first human guinea pig in an experiment using a psychoelectronic device to generate an armor-shield repelling strong forces. The main concern is that the field extends inward as well as outward from the body surface, possibly affecting the brain; animal trials indicate that it may suppress inhibitions in the subject. The test on Otterburn is successful; the expected field is generated, and he claims to feel no mental effect. But he declines to remove the device afterwards, and on his way out of the lab hits on female engineer Lucy Kneipf for a date; he has always been too timid to ask her out before. The now ultra-extroverted Otterburn takes Lucy to an expensive restaurant, where he becomes rude and offensive over what he sees as tardy service. On receiving the bill he sends Lucy on to the musical they are to attend while he forcefully disputes the liquor charge. He leaves without paying it, his personal force-field allowing him to act in relative impunity. At the theater he finds the frightened Lucy has stood him up, so he invites in a woman off the street. Unimpressed by the show, he throws tomatoes at the performers and then at the ushers when they come to kick him out. Fleeing behind the scenes he swipes a can of green paint from a scenery painter and amuses himself daubing it on half-naked chorus girls; in the ruckus created he escapes the building. Next he steals a policeman's horse for a joy ride. Abandoning it soon after, he ducks pursuit in a barbershop and contemplates more hell-raising. The next morning Otterburn is arrested in his home; Lucy, having realized what was going on, has reported him. His laboratory bails him out, and the field-generating device is removed, but Otterburn does not revert to his former self; the effect on his mind, it seems, may be permanent. Reasoning that even in the absence of inhibitions a sense of self-interest will lead him to curb his wild behavior, the lab-workers decide it will be safe to let him go free. For his part, Otterburn is unconcerned, supremely confident in his ability to manage his own life. Quitting his position, he leaves, whistling. Some time later the altered Otterburn checks in at his former job and reveals he talked the restaurant and theater out of pressing charges, successfully convincing them his escapades were good publicity, and talked himself into a being a salesman for the paint brand he had used, at twice his former engineering salary. His boss bewails the loss of one of his best scientists; his low-paid former colleagues, on the other hand, are left chagrined at his new prosperity. Reception Jeffery A. Beaudry, reviewing the story with the other pieces in The Shape of Things, singled it out for comment along with two others, noting that he \\"nodded with bemused sympathy\\" on reading it. He characterized the general content of the anthology as \\"stories from the late '40s and early '50s ... \\"pulpy and populated by mad scientists, good-guy scientists and helpless young 'girls,' but ... great fun.\\"Beaudry, Jeffery A. \\"Recommended Reading: Sci Fidelity.\\" In The Washington Post, September 30, 1990, page O14.

Since that time, her vocabulary of interlocking, jigsaw‚Äìpuzzle shapes orbiting complex, off-kilter compositions has remained fairly consistent. Her later work (e.g., My Own Dolly, 2018), which Art in America called \\"her jauntiest, most complex and absorbing ever,\\" has broadened to include near-cartoony forms alluding to the figure and Pop art, a more subdued palette, variation in the scale of shapes, and airier compositions.Morgan, Robert C.

He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment until mid-2015, when he was resentenced to the death penalty three times.  Biography  Dontae Morris was born the son of a 16-year-old who suffered from depression. His father was murdered when he was two years old, and the crime remains unsolved. He grew up partially with his sick grandmother and changed his school several times. From a new relationship his mother engaged in, two step-siblings were born. Dontae Morris is said to be a member of the \\"Bloods\\" street gang according to prison records,https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2010/07/05/arrest-was-at-law-office and he had a 7-year-old son in 2013. His aunt, Carolyn Riggins, worked at the Tampa Police Department and was released in July 2010, as the authorities discovered that she withheld important information that could have led to Morris being arrested earlier. His girlfriend, Cortnee Brantley, who had driven the car on the night of the June 29 murder, was sentenced to a one year prison sentence for fleeing from a crime scene and concealing a dangerous weapon.  Murders  Between May 18 and June 8, 2010, Morris shot and killed 21-year-old Derek Anderson, 42-year-old Rodney Jones and 25-year-old Harold Wright. According to the investigation, the reason was due to drug trades.Dontae Morris denied bail; investigators air possible motives in killings The crime scenes were located in the Kenneth Court Apartments, the Cotton Club Bar and Palm River-Clair Mel, all located in Tampa. On June 29, 2010, Morris shot and killed police officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis as they attempted to arrest him in East Tampa. Morris was a passenger in his girlfriend's vehicle when they were stopped on the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd and 50th Street for missing license plates. As there was an arrest warrant for Morris from Jacksonville for cheque fraud, Curtis requested assistance from his partner Kocab. When they asked him to put his hands on his back, Morris shot both policemen in the head with a pistol and then fled on foot.  Investigations and arrest  A witness alerted the police, who started a search for the culprit with a large contingent. The murders of the two officers had been recorded by the dashcam of David Curtis' patrol car, which helped identify Dontae Morris as the perpetrator. His girlfriend, who had fled the car and hid in an apartment, was also identified from the dashcam video. It was the most deadly day of the Tampa Police Department in over twelve years since May 19, 1998, when detectives Ricky Childers and Randy Bell were shot dead by Hank Earl Carr.Dash cam video reveals dying Tampa police officers' final moments In the following days, the search for Morris became the biggest manhunt in Tampa's history. More than 1,000 officers and employees from 22 agencies were involved in the search, including FBI and ATF officials, SWAT teams, armored vehicles, dog teams and helicopters with thermal imagers. In addition, about 300 homes were searched and a media-assisted search was launched, with hundreds of wanted posters installed in Florida and two other states. The reward for clues leading to his arrest was increased to $101,000. The authorities announced that Morris' criminal record was 14 pages long and he had twice been in jail. Offenses included disturbances on the street, car theft, drug possession, drug trafficking, violation of the weapons law, resistance to arrest, assault, violation of probation, attempted robbery and dangerous bodily harm. He was also charged with murder, but acquitted. At press conferences, the police also announced that Morris was suspected of two more murders of African-American residents of Tampa.Tampa police get mostly kudos in manhunt review On July 2, Dontae Morris was arrested by law enforcement at a law firm in south Tampa, and was taken to an isolated cell in the Orient Road Jail.Hunt for Dontae Morris ends in 'quiet' capture at South Tampa law firm  Charges and convictions  His trial began in July 2012 for the murder of Rodney Jones, who was shot dead on May 31, 2010 after leaving the Cotton Club Bar on North Albany Avenue. Based on text messages and testimonies, Morris was convicted and sentenced in March 2013 for murder and attempted robbery to a life sentence without parole, plus an additional 25 years. In November 2013, his trial began for the murder of the two police officers, Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis. Since Morris had been filmed during the killings by the dashcam of Curtis' patrol car and his name and date of birth were picked up, the jury only needed four hours to convict him of double murder. Following the ruling, Morris was sentenced to death in May 2014 by a judge in Hillsborough County.Dontae Morris sentenced to death for 2010 murders of Tampa officers In June, a judge announced that he would begin a new trial for Morris for the murder of Derek Anderson on July 20. Anderson had been shot dead in front of his home on May 18, 2010 after he had previously had an argument with Morris on a basketball court. A ballistic expert and a police spokeswoman also announced that the same weapon had been used in the murder of Anderson as in the murder of the two police officers. In July 2015, he was convicted by a jury after three days of counseling for the murder and again sentenced to death. The authorities also announced that Morris was accused of the July 8, 2010 murder of Harold Wright, who was robbed next to his vehicle on 51st Street and killed with a headshot. At that time, Morris' fingerprints had been secured at the crime scene. An acquaintance of his told the authorities that Morris had planned to rob Wright. However, in December 2015, the prosecutor announced without further public statement not to bring this last murder charge in court. Judge William Fuente then ordered the transfer onto the death row of Florida State Prison. In April 2017, his appeal against the death penalty in the case of the two police officers was rejected by the Florida Supreme Court. However, in January 2018, the Florida Supreme Court reversed the death penalty in the Derek Anderson case on the grounds that the jury's verdict was not unanimous.

She specializes in research questions at the intersection of sensory physiology, color vision, coloration, animal behavior, molecular evolution, and genomics. Briscoe's work is largely focused on questions surrounding vision in butterflies with a specific focus on establishing links between genetic expression patterns leading to coloration and vision with the physiological and behavioral traits of butterflies. Briscoe has discovered and systematically demonstrated over the course of her career that butterflies are a unique organism to enable such studies on account of the diversity of photoreceptor proteins, or opsins, which are expressed in the retina of a butterfly. She is also known for her studies on gene expression of phototransduction proteins, duplication events in opsin genes, the discovery of new opsins, and the discovery of pigments which present in the wing coloration patterns of butterflies. Her studies have also demonstrated the co-evolution of butterfly vision and wing color at a molecular-level as a strategy for secure inter-species communication. For her research contributions, Briscoe has been recognized as an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Entomological Society. Briscoe has also been recognized as a Distinguished Scientist of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). Early life and education Briscoe was born in Hawaii and was raised in Colton, California, where she graduated from Colton High School in 1988. Briscoe comes from a family of Mexican American teachers and was especially inspired to pursue higher education by her family members and most especially her material grandmother, Consuelo Lozano, and her mother, Loretta Mej√≠a. In 1937, Briscoe's maternal grandmother was the only Spanish-named woman attending Colton High in San Bernardino County to graduate. Briscoe's mother was the only Spanish-named woman from San Bernardino county to graduate from the University of California, Riverside in 1965. After graduating high school, Briscoe went on to study at Stanford University, where she received a B.A. in philosophy, a B.S. in biological sciences and a M.A. in philosophy. She continued her graduate studies at Harvard University, specializing in evolutionary biology where her Ph.D. advisers were Naomi Pierce and Richard Lewontin. After receiving her Ph.D. she was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Arizona and at the University of Colorado, Denver, where she was supported with a fellowship from the Ford Foundation. In 2012, Briscoe was an overseas visiting research fellow at St. John's College at the University of Cambridge. She has been a faculty affiliate of the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action since 2012. In the area of policy and higher education, Briscoe has been vocal on her support of government action to get more Latino individuals to teach science. Research, career, and service  Briscoe observing butterflies, a focus of her research Briscoe's research career has been largely distinguished by her studies on the evolution of vision in butterflies. She is particularly well known for the discovery of new opsins, her application of functional approaches for the study of light-sensitive pigments which lead to color vision, and her study of the links between genetic expression of these proteins and functional behavior. Her investigations have been largely situated in the field of molecular evolution. Since her time as a graduate student at Harvard University, Briscoe has been involved with the discovery of opsins which are key in butterfly vision alongside studying the expression levels of these photoreceptors as a function of functional butterfly behavior. Her studies have also sought to elucidate the role and emergence of double gene duplication events in opsin protein expression as a function of environmental stimuli. Such double duplication events have been hypothesized to play a key role in the evolution of color vision in primates, including humans. As Briscoe herself has addressed, gene duplication and mutation events in opsins more broadly account for a large fraction of genetic changes associated with human retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa. Briscoe's career has been distinguished by the study of diverse butterfly species and international collaborations which have supported these investigations. Her recent research collaboration between her team and that of Jorge Llorente Bousequets from the UNAM-Facultad De Ciencas was particularly productive and led to the discovery that the Heliconius butterfly species differentially expresses one or two genes for an opsin photoreceptor which is uniquely sensitive to ultra-violet reflecting wing colors. This discovery was particularly significant as it demonstrated that the Heliconius butterfly had co-evolved two traits, ultra-violet photoreceptors and ultra-violet reflecting wing pigments, as an effectively private (or secure) inter-species communication channel. In the course of the investigations, Briscoe and collaborators also identified the chemical composition of the evolved pigment which, in combination with the nanostructured nature of scale cells on the butterfly wing, leads to the phenomena of UV-yellow butterfly wing coloration. Her team's continued investigations on ultra-violet opsins in the Heliconius erato butterfly have elucidated additional layers of diversification in gene expression which are linked to a butterfly's gender. Specifically, females of the species have two different UV receptors, UVRh1 and UVRh2, while males only have one (UVRh2). These studies are of particular interest towards future investigations on understanding the evolutionary mechanisms leading to the emergence of novel opsins. In the area of service to the scientific community, Briscoe served as Associate Editor for the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution from 2005 until 2012. Since 2015, she has been an editorial board member of Physiological and Biochemical Zoology. She served as council member for the American Genetic Association from 2011 to 2014. She also served as an advisory board member of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCENT) from 2010 until 2012. Since beginning her independent research group in 2002, Briscoe has mentored fourteen graduate students and postdocs.

Early life Hertz was born in Hanover in Germany to diamond merchant Bram Hertz. She counted herself a descendant of Heinrich Hertz. She moved to London in 1837, and lived in both London and Bradford during that decade. She married her cousin, mill owner and yarn merchant William David Hertz at St James's Church, Westminster in 1851, with whom she had three children. Their Bradford home served as a meeting place for artists, thinkers and radicals. She met and befriended Frederic Harrison. Through Harrison and her circle of associates in Bradford, Hertz embraced the philosophy of positivism. Women's education Hertz was a proponent of women's education, in particular for working-class women who were not eligible to study in Mechanics' Institutes. She was associated with the Huddersfield Female Educational Institute, founded in 1847. In 1857, she helped to establish a similar institute in Bradford, serving on its committee. She founded Bradford Ladies' Educational Association in 1868, which raised funds to found Bradford Girls' Grammar School with the support of local Liberal MP William Edward Forster, husband of her Bradford Ladies Educational Association associate Jane Forster. When the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science held its 1859 congress in Bradford, Hertz presented a paper called Mechanics' Institutes for working women, with special reference to the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire in which she accepted reading, writing, arithmetic, and needlework as a core for female education, she rejected that education should be designed to prepare women \\"for the duties of wives and mothers, of mistresses and servants\\". She advocated for a broader curriculum influenced by Johann Heinrich Perstalozzi's theories of education. She served on the North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women and Maria Grey's National Union for Improving the Education of Women of All Classes. Later life Hertz moved to Harley Street in London in the 1870s, where she received guests with interests in radical causes at her salon including Robert Browning and Henry James. In 1876, she published a translation of a chapter from Auguste Comte's System of Positive Polity. Her husband died in 1880, whilst Hertz herself died in 1908 in her Lansdowne Crescent home.

They were first published during the author's exile in the United Kingdom after the Spanish Civil War.  Books  La Forja (The Forge) Washers next to Puente Segovia, Madrid 1900. La Forja describes the author's childhood and youth in Madrid prior to 1914 and his early schooling in Escuelas P√≠as in Lavapi√©s. During these years his mother worked as a laundress of military clothes, by the river Manzanares. The novel describes Barea's early ambitions of becoming an engineer and his frustration with an unequal social system that forces him to terminate his education and work in various jobs such as courier, shop attendant and bank employee. He enrolls in the UGT and develops ties with fellow socialists. Much of the book's focus is on the clash of classes under the Spanish monarchy and the rigid structure of an education system dominated by religious orders. The prose records with evocative detail the nature of urban life in Madrid, as well as in the rural areas where the author's extended family lived. The book ends with the news of the outbreak of World War I. La Ruta (The Track) La Ruta narrates Barea's military service and his participation in the Rif War in the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco, using it as a backdrop to explain the rise of fascism. The book focuses on the events preceding and following the disaster of Annual; detailing the incompetence and corruption of the Spanish military leadership, and the lack of training and preparation of the conscripted troops who have to endure the harsh conditions of colonial warfare. Barea himself served in a regiment of military engineers, reenlisting as a regular and being promoted to the rank of sergeant. The book refers to key historic figures such as Francisco Franco or Mill√°n Astray. \\"The Track\\" referred to in the title was a military road worked on by Barea's unit in the Moroccan hinterland. Back in Spain, emphasis is put on the coup staged by Primo de Rivera and the Army, as well as popular reaction. La Llama (The Clash) La Llama, the final book of the trilogy, begins with the declaration of the Second Republic and its early instabilities and quickly advances to the Civil War, paying special importance to the battle and siege of Madrid and the internal struggle of the republican government to win the war and contain the revolutionary efforts of anarchists and communists. As the war progresses, the mood of the citizens slowly declines as defeat becomes inevitable. Meanwhile, the author works as a censor and a broadcaster trying to keep morale high and avoiding news that may affect the republican cause. He resists interference by the bureaucracy and the prejudice that he and his lover Ilsa Pollak face for not being married. During the siege, the author also has met international supporters such as Ernest Hemingway. Finally, the author goes into exile with Pollak, first to France and finally the United Kingdom where he spends the rest of his life.  Publication  Spanish edition of the book held next to plaque signaling plaza Arturo Barea during its inauguration.  Origins  The author claimed he had always been stranded between the worlds of engineering and narration, interests that never vanished but, mainly due to circumstantial difficulties, was never able to devote his life to. It was only during the Siege of Madrid that he started seriously writing as a means of releasing the suffering and tension he experienced and saw in others. His early narrations were short stories that would later be recompiled in tomes such as \\"Valor y miedo\\" (Courage and Fear) and \\"El centro de la Pista\\" (The Center of the Path). These stories were well received among his acquaintances, especially his lover and future second wife Ilsa Pollak, whose extensive knowledge of foreign languages, being herself Austrian and speaking fluent English and French in addition to her native German, was pivotal in the translation and publication of his work.  First editions  The first edition of The Forging of a Rebel was published in English between 1941 and 1946. Written in Spanish, it was translated by Ilsa, his wife before publication. It was an instant success among critics, particularly Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez and George Orwell who called The Forge: \\"an excellent book ‚Ä¶ Se√±or Barea is one of the most valuable of the literary acquisitions that England has made as a result of Fascist persecution‚Äù. Consequently, the books were soon edited in the United States and Denmark. Only in 1951 would the books be published in Spanish by the Argentinian Editorial Losada and much later, with the death of Francisco Franco and the transition to democracy, in Spain. The prologue of the first edition includes the following comment, by Barea himself: > \\"Despu√©s de todo, la Espa√±a que quiero ense√±ar al lector brit√°nico ha de ser > un d√≠a parte de la paz mayor\\" (After all, the Spain I want to show to the > British reader must be, in the future, part of the greater peace)  Reception   Style  The books have been praised for their unique style and intent; trying to describe the convulsive Spanish society of the early 20th century. The author employed direct realism when describing the hardships of his own experiences and the people around him. As a matter of fact, as his social strata changed so did his world view and perception of classes and ideologies. His prose has sometimes been compared to that of Ramon Sender and P√≠o Baroja. He has also been praised for showing a lack of bias towards the various political factions involved and being able to perform an accurate description of his world and times.  TV adaptation  In 1990, RTVE adapted the book into a 6-episode miniseries, directed by Mario Camus. It became the most expensive miniseries developed by the company until then, with a total cost of 2.3 million pesetas. The series was highly regarded by critics and the public, earning a special mention in Prix Italia.

He was captured in 1943 and faced trial in 1944, following which he was convicted and two months later executed.  Biography  Willi Seng was born in Berlin. He became a member of a workers' sports club called \\"Fichte\\" in 1920 and in 1929 travelled to Moscow in order to take part in the Soviet sponsored Spartakiad sports festival. In 1930 he became a member of Rote Hilfe (\\"Red Aid\\"), a workers' welfare organisation widely (and correctly) believed to have close connections with the Communist Party and with Moscow. In 1932 he joined the Communist Party itself. In January 1933 a new government took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. The authorities were diligent in their persecution of political opponents, and in particular of communists, many of whom fled abroad. Others were arrested. Willi Senf was arrested the early part of 1933 and detained at the newly established Oranienburg concentration camp. On his release from \\"protective custody\\" he worked as a link-man for the Communist-backed Kampfgemeinschaft f√ºr Rote Sporteinheit (KG - loosely \\"Association for fighting for red sporting unity\\"), liaising with the Berlin city authorities. From 1934 he was in charge of the regional KG for \\"Neiderrhein\\", headquartered in D√ºsseldorf, where he was also the producer of two newspapers: \\"Westdeutscher Arbeitersport\\" (\\"West German Workers' Sport\\") and \\"Sportfreund\\" (\\"Friend of Sport\\"). The political nature of the KG nevertheless made his involvement with it illegal, and his sports journalism also gave him a significant public profile. In May 1935, responding to a wave of political arrests, he fled to Amsterdam. In August of that same year he moved on to Moscow where until the first part of 1937 he studied at the Communist International's \\"Lenin Academy\\". In 1938 the party leadership ordered Seng back to the west, initially to Paris which, along with Moscow, had become an informal headquarters for the German Communist Party in exile. From there he returned to Amsterdam from where, till October 1938, he worked as an instructor on behalf of the party's \\"foreign leadership\\" for the economically important Ruhr region of Germany. This involved frequent visits across the border into Germany in order to conduct secret meetings with on- the-spot contacts in major cities such as Dortmund, Essen and Oberhausen. At the end of January 1939 he was a participant at the party's \\"Bern Conference\\" which was named after the Swiss capital for security reasons. (It actually took place in the Paris suburb of Draveil.) After the German invasion of the Netherlands which took place in May 1940 he continued to be based, using false names, in the Netherlands. At the end of 1940 Seng was instructed, probably on the initiative of Wilhelm Kn√∂chel (who operated under the code name \\"Alfred\\"), to relocate to D√ºsseldorf and await further instructions. The instructions, which came quickly, involved working to set up an underground anti-government network in the Ruhr region. Seng had good business connections in places such as Essen, Duisburg, Bottrop, Wuppertal and in the Bergisches Land (hill country to the east of the industrial belt) on whom he could call for relevant specialist skills. Using cover names such as \\"August\\" and \\"Kurt\\", and working alongside Alfons Kaps, Wilhelm Kn√∂chel and Alfred Kowalke, he produced illegal literature under titles such as \\"Ruhr-Echo\\", \\"Illegaler SA-Mann\\" and \\"Friedensk√§mpfer\\" (\\"Fighters for Peace\\"). According to testimony provided by Alfons Kaps, the Gestapo succeeded in locating and arresting Willi Seng on 20 January 1943. Elsewhere there are suggestions that Kaps himself had been \\"persuaded\\" to set up a meeting with Seng which amounted to leading the Gestapo to \\"August\\", the name by which Seng was known to his comrade. In response to \\"intensified interrogation\\" techniques Seng not merely provided his interrogators with the information that they sought, but also agreed to arrange a secret meeting in Berlin with Wilhelm Kn√∂chel which would serve the purpose of leading the Gestapo to Kn√∂chel. That plan misfired, however, since on the day in question Kn√∂chel was seriously ill in bed, so never turned up for the meeting. On 24 May 1944 the special \\"People's Court\\" sentenced Will Seng to death. The sentence was carried out in Cologne on 27 July 1944.

The film stars Frankie Darro, Lassie Lou Ahern, Jobyna Ralston, Carroll Nye, Eugene Jackson, William Scott and Vadim Uraneff. The film was released on December 27, 1927, by Film Booking Offices of America. Plot Mickey Grogan (Frankie Darro), a nine-year old vagabond of the streets, assumes the responsibility for the well-being of a fellow homeless waif (Susan Dale, played by Lassie Lou Ahern), a sensitive architect named Jeffrey Shore (Carroll Nye) who is out of work for being too poor to pay for an operation necessary to save his remaining vision, and a kind-hearted office worker (Winnie, played by Jobyna Ralston) who is being stalked by a belligent Al Nevers (Billy Scott) as his overbearing attentions increasingly turn violent. On top of this, he also helps an industrialist (Crauford Kent) who is looking for a new factory design for his upcoming fleet of buildings, ones showcasing \\"plenty of light and air.\\" In between the assistance he gives others, he tries to make a living from selling discarded items from the city dump and provides moments of vivacious street entertainment with fellow dancers Susan Dale and a strangely uncredited Eugene Jackson. Thematic and Stylistic Influences In his lengthy analysis of the film, film scholar and historian Jeffrey Crouse writes that \\"Little Mickey Grogan begins as if what we were watching was a kind of forerunner of Italian neorealism, like Jean Renoir's Toni or Yasujiro Ozu's An Inn at Tokyo (both 1935), or the type of Zolaesque social realist cinema exercised during the silent era in such films as La Roue (Gance, 1923) or The Salvation Hunters (von Sternberg, 1925). ... [However] [i]f the viewer conceives of Little Mickey Grogan as a work of proto-neorealism, it is a perception that the movie soon corrects. Instead, it emerges neither as a neorealist film nor as a Bu√±uelian-type surrealist text, but as an engagingly well-polished thematic and stylistic example of what would become, with the consolidation of the studio system around 1930, classical Hollywood cinema.Jeffrey Crouse, \\"Gutter Kids: Little Mickey Grogan at 90,\\" Film International, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2018, pp. 18-19. Production Background Little Mickey Grogan is based on syndicated stories of the same name written by Arthur Guy Emprey, whose war experiences fighting as an American in the British army during World War I served as the material for his 1917 book, Over the Top, a big commercial success that sold a quarter of a million copies. Although noting the differences between them, Crouse theorizes that Emprey might have conceived of the character Mickey Grogan based on his time in France where Louis Feuillade's Bout de Zan formed the basis of a popular serial that ran from 1912 to 1916.Jeffrey Crouse, \\"Gutter Kids: Little Mickey Grogan at 90\\", Film International, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2018, p. 18 FBO acquired the rights to serve as a vehicle for child actor Frankie Darro, one of the studio's top emerging stars. Fresh off the success of her role as Little Harry in Universal's epic, Uncle Tom's Cabin (Pollard, 1927), Lassie Lou Ahern was cast opposite him. To give the film extra star power, accomplished Harold Lloyd costar Jobyna Ralston was added. Made in-between her leading roles in Ted Wilde's The Kid Brother and William Wellman's Wings, 1927 turned out to be her crowning year. The force that brought the Emprey stories to FBO was writer Gene Statton-Porter, one of the biggest bestselling authors of the early twentieth century, of which A Girl of the Limberlost (1909) is her most well- known. She formed her own production company to have control over the screen adaptations of her works, as well as those by other family-friendly authors. After her unexpected death in 1922, her daughter Jeanette Stratton-Porter took over, following her mother's original conception. She hand-picked screenwriters, directors (including husband, James Leo Meehan), camera operators, and film editors. They released their work through the American arm of the British distribution company, the Robertson-Cole Corporation, and eventually through the FBO. Among the artists who worked with Jeanette Stratton-Porter were the notable contributions of women. Chief among them were Dorothy Yost (who, along with husband Dwight Cummins, was the script writer on Little Mickey Grogan),Kim Tomadjolou, \\"Dorothy Yost,\\" in Jane Gaines, Radha Vatsal and Monica Dall'Asta (eds) Women Film Pioneers Project, New York, NY: Center for Digital Research and Scholarship, Columbia University, 2013. as well as fellow writers Marion Orth and Adele S. Buffington.\\"Yost's work is marked by an ethical current that runs through [her scripts], and as such figure as tales of moral uplift. In addition, she was also known for scripts that featured characters from a range of diverse cultural backgrounds. She did not shy away from a view of humanity that took in and showed different ethnic groups.\\"Jeffrey Crouse, \\"Gutter Kids: Little Mickey Grogan at 90,\\" Film International, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2018, p. 20. All of this is reflected in Little Mickey Grogan. In this sense, a Whitmanesque strain runs through the film, syncing well with Emprey and Stratton-Porter's sensibilities. Restoration Restoration on Little Mickey Grogan begin in 2015 when surviving cast member Lassie Lou Ahern approached Jeffrey Crouse to ask whether her final silent film existed anymore. (Surpassed only by Diana Serra Cary's \\"Baby Peggy,\\" Ahern would prove to be the last Hollywood performer who enjoyed a substantial career in 1920s film.)Jeffrey Crouse, \\"Lassie Lou Ahern Obituary,\\" The Guardian, February 26, 2018. After a worldwide search, an original 35mm nitrate copy was found at the Lobster Film Archive in Paris. Through a crowd source funding campaign, a digital copy of it was made by film preservationist Eric Grayson, and work on restoring the movie was performed by Grayson, Thad Komorowski, and Nevada State College students Aubrey Balzart and Cinnamon Stephens. A newly commissioned score was written by Dr. Philip Carli. Meanwhile, the film's intertitles were changed back to the English ones from the lone French print using an original copy of the script that Ahern still possessed. In addition, a 50-minute documentary on Ahern's career, Lassie Lou Ahern: A Voice for the Silent Age was made in 2016, and in 2018 a 7,000 word assessment of the film by Crouse appeared as well as a commentary track recorded of Ahern discussing the film and aspects of her silent film career. Among those who championed the restoration were Kevin Brownlow, Diana Serra Cary, George Toles, Leonard Maltin, Michael Feinstein, David Shepard, Guy Maddin, and Carol Cling. Owing to issues of copyright, a Blu-ray release of the film, with several bonus features, has been delayed. Historical value Little Mickey Grogan is the only FBO film starring Frankie Darro known to have survived. It is also the sole Gene Stratton-Porter Production Company motion picture distributed through FBO known to exist today. Of the 449 films made by FBO, just 123 remain. Interestingly, there is an ostentatious shot in the film in which a large billboard advertises another FBO film, the now lost Judgment of the Hills released earlier in 1927, and also featuring star Darro, director Meehan, screenwriter Yost, and editor Allen G.

The pub stood on Hill Street, in Birmingham City Centre, between Victoria Square and the western end of New Street Station. It closed in January 1984 and was demolished soon afterwards.  Architecture  The building, commissioned by the Holt Brewery Company (and later operated by their successors, Ansells Brewery), in art deco style was clad in black stone, with a bas relief carving of a stylised golden eagle, by sculptor William Bloye, over the main entrance. It was erected in the 1930s on the site of an earlier pub of the same name.  Music  It was at the Golden Eagle, in 1963, that Spencer Davis met brothers Steve (then aged 14 and still at school) and Muff Winwood, performing there as the Muffy Wood Jazz Band, resulting in them forming the Spencer Davis Group. The Spencer Davis Group made their debut at the Eagle, and subsequently had a Monday-night residency here. Other bands who played there before going on to bigger things include Iron Maiden and U2. For a year from June 1973, the pub was home to a folk club, run by resident Birmingham folk/rock band 'Scotch Mist' and, from 1976-1979, a club night, 'Shoop Shoop', held on Thursdays. Shoop Shoop was run by Mike Horseman and Pete King, the latter of whom went on to manage Steel Pulse.  Legacy  In August 2018, Birmingham-based 'Two Towers' brewery launched a \\"Golden Eagle\\" ruby ale, in their \\"Gone but Not Forgotten\\" range, to commemorate the pub. The site of the pub subsequently became a car park.

It was built in 1905‚Äì06, shortly after Carrick was organized as a borough, and housed the town's municipal government, volunteer fire department, and jail. After Carrick was annexed into the city of Pittsburgh in 1927, the building remained in use as a fire station until 1957 and has since been converted to commercial use. The Borough Building was designed by Edward Stotz in an eclectic style with strong Dutch Revival influences. It was nominated as a Pittsburgh historic landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh in October 2018. History Historically a sparsely developed agricultural and mining community, Carrick began to urbanize around the turn of the 20th century. Lots were laid out, residents built stately homes like the Wigman House, and a spirit of progress and optimism pervaded the community. By 1906, it had over 4,000 residents. In 1904, Carrick was officially organized as a borough in order to provide better services for its residents. One of the new borough's first orders of business was to construct a building \\"to be used as a house for Fire Company, Town Hall, and for other Borough purposes.\\" The Carrick Borough Council commissioned Edward Stotz to design the building and purchased a lot on Brownsville Road for $20,000. Construction of the building was officially authorized in March 1905. The completed Borough Building was dedicated on June 21, 1906, the second anniversary of the borough's founding. The occasion was marked with speeches, fireworks, and a parade. The Pittsburgh Press described the new building on its completion: The Borough Building continued to house Carrick's local government until 1927, when the borough was annexed into the city of Pittsburgh. Afterwards, the fire department was left as the only tenant, becoming Engine Company No. 23 of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. In 1933, the building's tower and bell were removed because of safety concerns. The bell had previously been rung to call out the volunteer firefighters and to signal the borough's nightly 9 pm curfew, but after 1926 it was only used for special occasions like New Year's Eve. The fire department moved to a new location in 1957 and the Borough Building was eventually converted to commercial use. Architecture The Borough Building is a two-story brick and stone building situated on the west side of Brownsville Road. It is about wide, occupying most of its lot, and is set back from the sidewalk. The building stands on the side of a hill and has a basement which opens at ground level in the rear due to the topography. It was originally freestanding, but now adjoins the neighboring building to its right. The architecture is eclectic, drawing heavily on Dutch Revival. It was the work of well-known Pittsburgh architect Edward Stotz, whose other notable designs include Schenley High School, Fifth Avenue High School, and the Church of the Epiphany. The principal facade consists of a narrow, one-story entrance bay alongside a larger two-story bay. On the ground floor, the entirety of the main bay is occupied by the former fire truck entrance, which has wooden slat garage doors and a stone lintel. The second floor is dominated by a large arched window opening onto the former council chamber. It was originally divided into six panes in a 2√ó3 grid, but has since been replaced with four modern double-hung windows with fixed panes overhead. The arch above the window has alternating brick and stone voussoirs and rests on brick piers with stone quoins on both the inside and outside corners. The inner quoins terminate at the springers of the arch, while those on the outside continue to the roofline. Above the springers, subtly projecting vertical bands of alternating brick and stonework extend to the parapet, terminating in plinths that originally held ball finials. The finials are still extant but were moved farther back on the roof. The original tall, curvilinear parapet has been truncated. The entrance bay is about wide and slightly recessed. The entryway itself occupies most of the bay and is set between piers with alternating bands of brick and stone terminating in ball finials. A stone slab inscribed \\"Borough of Carrick Incorporated June 21, 1904\\" sits above the door and transom light. The bay is crowned with a stone pediment with carved scrollwork and a medallion inscribed with the construction date. The tower that originally stood at the rear of the building is no longer extant.

Fossils are currently known only from China. Olivooides was approximately 600‚Äê870 Œºm in diameter. It was an egg with a large yolk content. Fossils from Shaanxi, China can be found in the cleavage, gastrulation, organogenesis, cuticularization, pre‚Äêhatching, post‚Äêhatching and subsequent growth stages of development. This fossil is a result of soft-bodied preservation. Olivooides has pentaradial symmetry and is usually preserved by calcium phosphate endocast. The internal structure is rarely preserved. It has no larval stage, so it likely had a quick and direct development. Little is known about which organisms olivooides is related to. It has similarities to priapulid worms in the embryonic stages. Pentaradial symmetry can be seen in parts of the priapulid worms as well. However, olivooides has one orifice that is assumed to have been both a mouth and anus. The priapulid worm has a complete gut. Olivooides has also been compared to echinoderms based on its pentaradial symmetry, but this comparison is a bit far-fetched since echinoderms are not the only organisms to have pentaradial symmetry. It can also be seen in both priapulids and cnidarians. Olivooides does not have a calcite skeleton with a mesh structure, either. Olivooides is most likely affiliated with cnidarians.

Eve doesn't think of much and keeps her mind set on her romantic interest at the time, Jesse. Jesse is a Columbia student who is an aspiring musician. Jesse and Eve have a tumultuous relationship due to both of their strong personalities as well as Jesse's drug and alcohol use. Ben and Eve share their second encounter while they are both out at a tiki bar in New York.

HFZ announced Chipperfield's role as architect in 2015, in the same press release that disclosed the development's name. The announcement also disclosed that the building would have both condominiums and a luxury hotel. The site formerly held a parking lot, and constituted the final undeveloped plot on Bryant Park. The developers of the nearby Bryant Park Hotel sued HFZ over the use of the name \\"The Bryant\\". Design HFZ solicited plans from architectural firms including Morris Adjmi and Spivak Architects before settling on Chipperfield. The facade is made of precast, polished concrete, a choice Chipperfield made so that the structure would be aesthetically distinguished from new construction that employs glass as its facade. The New York Times referred to the facade as \\"[...] a touch that promises to make the building stand out\\". The precast material features marble and sandstone chips in various colors. The colors of the inserted materials reference nearby buildings. Chipperfield's firm also designed the interior, which features herringbone floors. The facade extends into the building's residences. Though The Bryant is Chipperfield's first ground-up commission in New York, he previously designed the interior of the Bryant Park Hotel, inside the American Radiator Building, which neighbors The Bryant.

Early life and education Broca was born in Bucharest. The Broca family immigrated to Montreal, Canada in 1962. There, she attended and graduated from Northmount High School in 1964. She began drawing and painting at an early age and won several artistic awards before she enrolled in the BFA programme at Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University). Broca graduated with honours in 1968. She became a Canadian citizen in 1967. In 1969 Broca received a Bourse de Perfectionnement from the Quebec Government to study abroad.

She worked on the Karonga Prevention Study on HIV and Tuberculosis in Malawi. She is also a sculptor.  Education and early career  Glynn completed an MSc in Epidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 1990. She completed her PhD in infectious diseases in 1993.  Career  Glynn has worked in Malawi, Sierra Leone and South Africa. She studies the relationship between education and health. She has conducted several large-scale studies into the prevalence of infectious diseases in Africa. Glynn studies the relationship between mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV. In 1998, Glynn studied the resurgence of tuberculous and how it was impacted by HIV infection. She monitored the Beijing genotype of mycobacterium tuberculosis for seven years in Malawi. She hypothesised that it may have originated from Chinese agricultural advisors. She continued to monitor tuberculosis in Malawi for several decades. She began to monitor the association of HIV and educational attainment in Thailand and Africa. She found that in Thailand, more schooling resulted in less infection, whereas in Africa higher attainment resulted in a greater risk. She discussed her work on sequencing the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome on the ELife podcast. She was awarded a Department of Health Public Health Career Scientist Award in 2002. In 2008 Glynn edited the book HIV, Resurgent Infections and Population Change in Africa. She identified that access to free HIV/AIDS drugs resulted in a significant reduction of adult mortality rates. Glynn went on to study how the menarche impacted the prevalence of herpes simplex. In 2015 she ran a free three-week course in the science of ebola. The course was made available on FutureLearn. She monitored recrudescence of severe Ebola in Western Africa. Since 2016, Glynn has been a member of the Public Health England Rapid Support Team. Using the anti-glycoprotein IgG capture assay, Glynn demonstrated that asymptomatic Ebola virus infection occurs but would have little impact on herd immunity. She used data from 2007 to 2016 to show that failure in the early stages of school in Malawi could be used to predict pregnancy and marriage.  Sculpture  Glynn is sculptor. She uses her sculpture to illustrate human life and interactions. For the Bloomsbury Festival, Glynn created a mobile sculpture that visualised Indo-European languages. She has exhibited in Hampton Court Palace and Clare Hall, Cambridge. In Aspects of Life, Glynn used wire, bronze and giant sea pods to depict chromosomes.

She is also on the board of the EAT foundation, and often participates in public discussion of food and climate in Sweden. Early life and education Gordon, was born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden. She was a high school exchange student in Northern Australia, and a university exchange student in Burkina Faso. As an undergraduate she studied biology. Her interest in further study in ecology was sparked by a lecture by Carl Folke on how people are connected to ecosystems, and this experience led her to contact him, and go on to study for a PhD with him at Stockholm University. Gordon‚Äôs PhD focussed on the role of water in the biosphere at local and planetary scales. Her PhD was supervised by Carl Folke and Malin Falkenmark in Systems Ecology at Stockholm University. Gordon spend part of her PhD in Canberra, Australia collaborating with Australian scientists at CSIRO. The final paper from her thesis was the first assessment of how human land use change, especially deforestation and irrigation, had altered the flow of evaporative water into the atmosphere. Gordon‚Äôs earned her PhD in 2003 in Natural Resources Management, Department of Systems Ecology, Stockholm University for her dissertation ‚ÄúLand Use, Freshwater Flows and Ecosystem Services in an Era of Global Change‚Äù. In 2004, her PhD was recognized Stiftelsen Kung Carl XVI Gustafs 50-√•rs fond, an award for excellent PhDs. Career and research Following her PhD, Gordon was a postdoctoral fellow at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in Colombo, Sri Lanka. There she worked with David Molden on the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture. Following that she returned to Stockholm University where she worked as a researcher, in 2006 at the Department of Systems Ecology and then from 2007 at the Stockholm Resilience Centre. She became an associate professor in 2012, and deputy director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre in 2013. She has also been a visiting researcher at CIRAD in France, McGill University in Canada, and STIAS - the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study in Stellenbosch, SOuth Africa. In 2018, Gordon became director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. The Stockholm Resilience Centre is a partnership of Stockholm University and the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It is a large transdisciplinary sustainability research centre with about 150 staff, which has Masters and PhD programmes in sustainability science. Gordon‚Äôs research has three main themes: research in Africa, water, and food. Gordon has had long term research engagement in Africa. Over the past 15 years, she has conducted research in Burkina Faso, Tanzania, South Africa, Senegal, and Ghana. Gordon‚Äôs research on water has focussed on unravelling the critical roles of how evaporation of water impacts water flows. WIth her PhD student Patrick Keys, she developed the concept of the precipitationshed. From her work on agriculture, Gordon moved on to the ecology of the food system, and she has increasingly collaborated with chefs and food producers. She is on the board of the EAT Foundation, and is one of the authors of the EAT-Lanet planetary health diet, which developed dietary guidelines that aim to provide healthy nutritious food to the world‚Äôs people while limiting the damage of farming to the Earth‚Äôs climate, nature, water. Gordon‚Äôs leadership on sustainable and healthy food was noted by the magazine Aktuell H√•llbarhet, which considered her as one of the 100 most powerful Swedish sustainability leaders. Notable publications Gordon‚Äôs most cited research has been on ecosystem services, food, and water.

The trunk is usually subterranean, but it may occasionally breach the ground with age. It has 4-13 leaves; these have a 5-18cm long unarmed petiole which has margins fringed with fibres. The rachis of the leaf is 25-65cm long and has 16-28 pairs of pinnae (leaflets) arranged regularly down its length and inserted in a single plane per side of the leaf, a pair of pinnae thus forming a neat 'V'-shape. The pinnae in the middle of the leaf blade are 20-32cm long and 0.4-1cm wide. In the wild the leaves are recorded as coloured greyish-green, the petioles yellowish.Campos Rocha A, Lorenzi H (2018).

Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/ymks0x accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-10-19. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1099311497 In cultivation the leaves are bluish-green, and young leaves are very finely coated in a white wax. The inflorescence is branched to a single degree. The developing inflorescence is protected within a 20-33cm long spathe with an enlarged portion which is 10-18cm long and 1.4-3cm wide. The spathe is coloured green, has a woody consistency and the outer surface is covered in short, rusty-coloured, pubescent (downy) hairs that fall off easily and as the spathe matures. The inflorescence is finely coated in pale-coloured wax. The rachis of the inflorescence is only 1-4cm long, with 1-5 rachillae (branches) which are 6-15cm long. The flowers are coloured purple or purplish-yellow. The staminate (male) flowers are 9mm long; the pistillate (female), 7-8 by 7-8mm. The ripe fruit are coloured greenish-purple, ovoid-shaped, 2-2.5cm long and 1.8-2.9cm wide. The flesh is yellow and sweet-sour. The nut within is hard, 1.5-1.8cm long and 1-1.2cm wide, and usually contains a single seed. The shape of the nut has been said to be ovoid or elliptic-shaped, or globose (round). The plants look like a clump of grass. Similar species Soares considers it most similar to Butia microspadix, differing from that species by the spathes being covered in short pubescent hairs that fall off, whereas those of B. microspadix have long and persistent hairs upon their stem. It also grows much faster and is more robust than B. microspadix. In a key to the genus provided in 2014, Noblick contrasts it to B. marmorii, but the spathe in that species is papery, smooth or scaly, and the inflorescence has a much shorter peduncle and rachillae. It grows in the same region as B. eriospatha and B. microspadix. Distribution & habitat This plant is extremely rare. As of 2017 it has not been found anywhere except the type locality in the east of the state of Paran√° in southeastern Brazil. It was discovered and collected in 2008 along a highway in the municipality of Jaguaria√≠va. It grows in sunny high altitude grassland, near a river, in sandy soils. Cultivation Seeds have been offered for sale. It has been grown by at least two collectors as of 2014. Conservation As of 2018 the Centro Nacional de Conserva√ß√£o da Flora has not yet rated the conservation status for Brazil, and it is listed as 'not evaluated'. It was grown ex situ in the Jardim Bot√¢nico Plantarum in Nova Odessa, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, by 2009. As of 2017 the locality is protected within a conservation area, the geological park √Årea de Preserva√ß√£o Ambiental da Escarpa Devoniana, but much of the nearby area has been converted to soya cultivation. This species is extremely rare, the least known of the Brazilian Butia species, known only from a single locality and rarely grown in cultivation. It is so rare or little studied that in a 2017 study attempting to calculate population abundance it was deemed 'data deficient' (along with B. witeckii, which has been collected in two localities).

Etymology The specific epithet refers to the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina where it is the most distributed. Taxonomy & nomenclature These palms were only named as a new species in 2010, although the populations of this species were known. Before 2010 the palms growing in this region were classified as Butia capitata. J. R. Mattos reclassified this population as B. capitata var. odorata in 1977 (see B. odorata), As such, a number of palms under cultivation in botanical gardens, private collections or in the nursery trade under the name B. capitata or B. capitata var. odorata are in fact this species. Larry R. Noblick and Harri Lorenzi described B. catarinensis, B. matogrossensis and B. pubispatha in 2010 in the Flora brasileira: Arecaceae (palmeiras) by Lorenzi et al. (Noblick also described B. lepidotispatha in 2010). Description This is a solitary-trunked palm, the trunk being , exceptionally , tall, with a diameter of . The trunk is covered with the persistent bases of the old palm fronds. These fronds are 9-32 in number and arranged in a spiral around the trunk. The blade is by . The petiole is glabrous (hairless), in length and wide, flat on top and round elsewhere. The margins of the petioles are densely toothed with numerous, robust, up to long spines, and many flattened fibres when the leaves are young. The rachis of the leaf is in length, with 48-62 pairs of pinnae (leaflets) which are glaucous-coloured and arranged uniformly along the rachis. Unlike other species of Butia (except B. odorata), these are usually in the same plane, but sometimes inserted at very slightly divergent angels along the rachis, but without giving the leaf a plumose aspect such as in Syagrus, and with each pair of pinnae forming a neat V-shape. The pinnae in the middle of the leaf blade are long and in width. The inflorescence is branched to the 1st degree, has a peduncle long and wide, and has a prophyll long, wide, and covered in a brown tomentum. The young inflorescence develops in a glabrous, lightly striated, woody spathe which is in length and has an enlarged portion at the end which is long wide and ending in a short, sharply pointed tip. The axis (width?) of the inflorescence is long. The rachis of the inflorescence is long and has 35-135 rachillae (branches) which are long. The flowers can be coloured yellow, greenish-yellow, yellow and violet, or completely violet. The staminate (male) flowers are in length; the pistillate (female) flowers are . The shapes of both the fruit and nut are ovoid. The ripe fruit are coloured yellow, orange, or red. The fruit are long, wide, have a persistent perianth, and have a yellow, juicy, lightly fibrous flesh. The nut is hard, long, wide, dark-brown coloured, contains a homogeneous endosperm, and has 1 to 2, rarely 3, seeds within. The nut is without a beak or other sort protuberance on its apex. Similar species It is very similar to Butia odorata, a palm with a similar habitat but further south along the coast, but may be distinguished from this species by its much smaller height, almost always to just . Distribution It is native to the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. It grows in the lowlands situated in a relatively narrow strip along the coast from the municipalities of Araquari in Santa Catarina to Os√≥rio in Rio Grande do Sul. Habitat It is typically found growing not far from the coast in restinga, a type of dry, coastal, tropical thorn-scrub. It grows on coastal dunes and older stabilised dunes further inland. It appears to prefer densely vegetated or wooded environments. It grows in sandy and rocky soils. Uses The edible fruit of this palm are collected for myriad uses where the trees grow naturally in Brazil.

The railcars were used to service the electrified sections of line between Santiago, Valparaiso, Chill√°n, and Concepci√≥n, as well as used occasionally to service Temuco and Osorno. Six units were built and were numbered AEZ-41 to AEZ-46.  Routes and services  The units were built and introduced into service in 1973 and are now over 45 years old. When they were introduced, electrification only reached Laja and the units were hauled by a diesel locomotive to electrified sections such as Temuco. A generator car was attached to operate interior lights and air conditioning. The AEZ units were popular among passengers due their speed and comfort. Because of their Japanese origin, they became known as the Japanese Train. They were often assigned to the Santiago‚ÄìChill√°n day service (398 km) which took five hours until they were replaced by the second hand Spanish UTS-444 electric units in 2002. The AEZ railcars were often used on the Santiago‚ÄìTalcahuano service (Automotive to Talcahuano) from 1994 until the suspension of this service in 2007. The AEZ railcars were used on the Santiago‚ÄìTalca route and on infrequent runs to Osorno and Temuco. Due to the 2010 earthquake, electrification was cut back to Chill√°n, isolating the section from Laja to Talcahuano. If the AEZ units were to run beyond Chill√°n, they would require a diesel locomotive once more. Repairs to the electrified rails have not been completed and, because there is little use of the line by electric trains south of Laja, will not likely be repaired in future.

There were no injuries and AEZ-43 was repaired and returned to service.  Current status  Two out of the six units built (AEZ-45 and AEZ-46) have been scrapped, and the driving car of AEZ-43 was scrapped due to accident damage. The driving car of AEZ-43 was later replaced by a driving car from AEZ-46. The four remaining units were refurbished in the early 2000s with a new interior and paint scheme.

Such language is a euphemism for the Belt and Road Initiative - in other words, the DFC was intended as an American counterweight to China's neo-imperialistic projection of soft-power. Key changes mandated by the BUILD Act include: * The doubling of the investment cap to $60 billion * New financial tools including equity financing, technical assistance, and feasibility studies * The ability to use local currency loans and first-loss guarantees to reduce risk * A ‚Äúpreference‚Äù for U.S. investors, rather than a requirement, thereby expanding partnership opportunities with foreign investors * Prioritization of low- and lower-middle income countries * Enhanced alignment with U.S. foreign policy in close coordination with counterparts like the U.S. Department of State * A seven- year authorization The changes are predicated on making DFC more responsive and cost effective.  Products and services  DFC helps companies manage the risks associated with investment in emerging markets by providing financial tools when they are unavailable or insufficient from commercial sources.  Equity Financing  Direct equity and support for investment funds  Debt Financing  Direct loans and guarantees of up to $1 billion for tenures as long as 25 years, with specific programs targeting small and medium U.S. businesses  Political Risk Insurance  Coverage of up to $1 billion against losses due to currency inconvertibility, government interference, and political violence including terrorism. DFC also offers reinsurance to increase underwriting capacity  Technical Development  Feasibility studies and technical assistance accelerate project identification and preparation to better attract and support private investment in development outcomes  Investments  DFC invests in sectors ranging from critical infrastructure, energy, and technology to healthcare and financing for small businesses and women entrepreneurs. To ensure that all investments adhere to high standards and respect the environment, human rights, and worker rights, the agency monitors all projects from their inception to the conclusion of DFC financial support. DFC‚Äôs investments span Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Indo-Pacific, and emerging markets around the world with a focus on low- and lower middle-income countries. The agency considers investments in other countries that are important to U.S. foreign policy and national security or address key agency priorities such as women‚Äôs economic empowerment.  Initiatives   2X Women's Initiative  Launched by OPIC in March 2018, DFC‚Äôs 2X Women's Initiative has catalyzed more than $1 billion of investment in women globally. In addition to pursuing projects that are owned by, led by, or supporting women in the developing world, DFC applies a gender lens to all investments to ensure that women are receiving the net benefits of projects supported by the agency. DFC also collaborates with the development finance institutions (DFIs) of other G7 countries through the 2X Challenge‚Äîa commitment to mobilizing $3 billion for global women‚Äôs economic empowerment.  Connect Africa  Through Connect Africa, originally announced by OPIC in July 2018, DFC is committed to investing $1 billion in transportation, information and communications technology, and value chains in Sub-Saharan Africa to improve connectivity and support economic growth.  Advancing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific  In recognition of the great need for quality investment to spur continued economic growth across the Indo-Pacific as well as increasing instances of ‚Äúdebt trap‚Äù investments advanced by authoritarian regimes in the region, the Indo-Pacific has become a region of focus for DFC. DFC has prioritized the development of the region‚Äôs transportation, energy, and digital infrastructure through transparent, responsible, and private sector-led investments.

Early life and education Addison Clay Harris was born on October 1, 1840, in rural Wayne County, Indiana, and was one of Martha (Young) and Branson Lewis Harris's two sons. Branson Harris, a Wayne County farmer, also served in three sessions of the Indiana House of Representatives (1853, 1875, and 1877). Branson Harris's ancestors came to North America from Cornwall, United Kingdom; his father moved the family of Quakers from North Carolina to settle in Indiana. Addison Harris received his early education in local Quaker schools near his Wayne County home. He enrolled at North Western Christian University (present-day Butler University) in 1860, and graduated two years later in 1862. After college he read law for three years at the Indianapolis firm of Barbour and Howland and studied under Indiana Supreme Court Justice Samuel E. Perkins.

In addition to their Indianapolis home, Harris acquired property in rural Hamilton County, Indiana, in 1880 and later had the home on the site remodeled and enlarged to use as a summer residence. The West-Harris House in Hamilton County was later nicknamed Ambassador House in reference to his diplomatic service as a U.S. Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary (ambassador) to Austria- Hungary from 1899 to 1901. Career Harris was admitted to the bar in 1865 and established a law partnership with John T. Dye in Indianapolis, Indiana. They dissolved their fourteen-year partnership in 1879.

Harris was also a member of the Republican Party and active in state politics. He served in the Indiana Senate from 1876 to 1880, but was unsuccessful in his bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1889. Harris used his political connections with Charles W.

Fairbanks met in the law offices of Dye and Harris to establish the Indianapolis Bar Association. Harris served as president of the association in 1883 and in 1890. Harris and Dye maintained their law practice for fourteen years, but dissolved the partnership in 1879, when Dye went to work for the Big Four Railroad. Afterwards, Harris practiced law alone, mainly focusing on constitutional law and corporate law, his specialty. Harris became one of the state's most prominent lawyers in the late nineteenth century and first decade of the twentieth century. He supported the concept of workers' compensation and favored the use of arbitration boards to settle labor disputes. Harris also authored Modern Views of Compensation for Personal Injuries (Indianapolis, 1909). In addition, he delivered lectures at Purdue University regarding railroads and railroad management that were later published.

He served in two sessions of the Indiana General Assembly (1877 and 1879) before his term ended in 1880. Harris favored progressive legislation. He became a member of the Senate's judicial committee and a leader of the Republicans on the Senate floor at a time when the state had a Democratic majority. While Harris was serving in his first session of the state senate in 1877, his father, Branson Harris, was serving in the Indiana House of Representatives. In 1889 Harris was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. He served as a presidential elector for Indiana in 1896.

Model BX/BY and BXL Based on a lengthened version of the Vauxhall Cadet the new car had a conventional chassis with semi-elliptical leaf springs all round and Vauxhall-Lovejoy hydraulic dampers. Wire -spoked wheels were fitted. Compared with the Cadet, the engine was mounted further forwards. To satisfy the demand for larger coach-built bodies the BXL model was a long wheelbase version. Two engines were offered, both six cylinder. The larger engine with a tax horsepower rating of 27 had a capacity of 3180cc and was based on the VY Cadet but with an improved cylinder head and 5.6:1 compression ratio. It had a bore of 81 mm and stroke of 95 mm. The smaller 20hp, 2393cc had a reduced bore of 73mm and produced 52bhp at 3900rpm. The power was transmitted to the rear axle via a single-plate clutch to a 4-speed gearbox, with ‚Äúsilent third‚Äù and synchromesh on 3rd & 4th gears. Twelve volt electrics were fitted. An unusual feature unique to the Big Six was the ‚ÄúPedomatic‚Äù starting system. To start the car the accelerator pedal had to be depressed which switched on the starter motor. After the engine started the vacuum in the inlet manifold disengaged the starter motor. The factory standard six light saloon was well fitted out with leather upholstery and lots of wood trimmings. All the windows used \\"Triplex\\" toughened glass. Other bodies which appeared in Vauxhall's own brochure included the \\"Hurlingham\\" coup√© built by Grosvenor, and the Rye cabriolet, and Denton and Romney coup√©s by Martin Walker. In 1934 a 7-seater \\"Newmarket\\" saloon was added to the range. 1935 saw several changes including a re-designed radiator grille painted in body colour, the spare wheel mounted on the wing got a cover and the front seats were redesigned. The chassis was also supplied to external coachbulders including Salmons. 1934 BX 20 hp roadster body by Holden The launch price for the standard saloon was GBP325 and the most expensive car in the range, the long-wheelbase limousine was GBP550. A 27hp BY was tested by The Motor magazine in 1934 and achieved a top speed of 72mph and accelerated from 0-60mph in 28 seconds. Autocar magazine tested a 20hp BY in 1936 and recorded 0-60 in 36.5 seconds. They did not record an actual top speed but stated that it would exceed 70mph. 3788 BY/BX and 796 BXL cars were produced. Model GY/GL 1937 GY 25 hp built by Holden The GY/GL or Twenty Five replaced the BX/BY in 1937 being first shown at the 1936 London Motor Show. The GL code was for the long wheelbase version. Although the chassis had the same wheelbase options as the outgoing model it was completely new and featured cross-braced spacing members for extra rigidity. It was the last car chassis to be designed by Vauxhall. Steel wheels replaced the wires and the front suspension was now independent using torsion bars. Lockheed hydraulic brakes with a dual-circuit for safety were used. The engine was extensively altered and its capacity increased to 3215cc. The change was achieved by extending the stroke to 101.6mm and decreasing the bore to 81.9mm the effect of which was to put the car into the lower 25hp tax bracket. The 4-speed gearbox was carried over and in 1938 gained synchromesh on first gear. Also for 1938 the car came as standard with a heater and the Pedomatic starting system was dropped. Authorised bodies included a standard saloon by Vauxhall (GBP298), a Tickford foursome coup√© (GBP365), Wingham cabriolet by Martin Walker (GBP400), Sports Saloon by Grosvenor (GBP345), Continental saloon by Connaught (GBP498) and Limousine by Grosvenor (GBP575). A car tested by the Autocar magazine reached 76mph and accelerated from 0-60mph in 21.9seconds 6822 were produced when World War 2 stopped production. The car did not re-appear after the war.

His works may be found in many churches around the Maltese Islands, as well as in some private collections and museums. He is considered to be the greatest painter from 18th-century Malta. Biography National Museum of Fine Arts, Valletta Zahra was born in Senglea, as the son of the stone carver Pietro Paolo Zahra and Augustina Casanova. His exact date of birth is not known, but he was baptised at the Senglea parish church on 15 December 1710. Little is known of Zahra's early life, but he likely received a good education. Zahra's career as an artist lasted for four decades, and he came to be considered as the greatest painter from Malta of the 18th century. He painted in the Baroque style and was strongly influenced from the art scene of Naples. Zahra's works include many religious paintings, including altarpieces or other large paintings for churches, vault murals and devotional paintings for private commissions. He is also responsible for a number of portraits, drawings for reredoses, some furniture in churches and works in marble. He probably began to paint at a young age, and he likely trained at Gio Nicola Buhagiar's workshop in the 1730s. By around 1740, his style began to mature and develop further than that of his tutor Buhagiar. Zahra became the most prolific Maltese painter by around 1745, being rivaled by the French artist Antoine de Favray who at that time worked in Malta. Zahra's style further developed over the years, and in around the mid-1750s his figures and the atmosphere of his paintings had changed, showing influences from Mattia Preti and Favray himself. Zahra's first significant commission came in 1732, when he painted an altarpiece depicting Three Dominican Saints Adoring the Holy Name of Jesus for the Church of Santa Maria della Grotta in Rabat. His most significant work includes the paintings on the ceiling of the Chapter Hall of the Mdina Cathedral, which were done in 1756. Zahra moved from his hometown Senglea to the capital Valletta. He was married to Teresa Fenech from 26 February 1743 until her premature death on 27 May 1751. They had five children together, three of whom survived infancy. Zahra died on 19 August 1773 at the age of 62. Works St. George's Basilica, Victoria, Gozo Zahra's works can be found in many churches throughout the Maltese Islands, as well as in private collections and museums. Works by Zahra are located in St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina, the Cathedral of the Assumption, Gozo, the parish churches of Attard, Balzan, Birkirkara, Floriana, Gƒßarb, Gƒßargƒßur, Gƒßaxaq, Gudja, Lija, Marsaxlokk, Mosta, Naxxar, Qormi, Rabat, Senglea, Siƒ°ƒ°iewi, Sliema, Tarxien, Valletta, Victoria, Xagƒßra, Xewkija, ≈ªabbar, ≈ªebbuƒ°, ≈ªejtun and ≈ªurrieq, along with numerous other churches and chapels.

Born in Oxfordshire, Garratt was educated at Rugby School and then attended Hertford College, Oxford. In 1912, he joined the Indian Civil Service, based in Bombay. He was placed in the Indian Army Reserve of Officers in 1915, and from 1916 was on active service with the 21st Cavalry, taking part in the Mesopotamian campaign. After the end of World War I, Garratt returned to the civil service, but he resigned in 1922, unhappy about the amount of money being spent on prestigious projects while poverty was widespread in the country. He found work as the Berlin correspondent of the Westminster Gazette. Garratt returned to the UK in 1923, settling in Cambridgeshire. There, he took up farming, and also became politically active. He joined the Independent Labour Party, and stood unsuccessfully for the Labour Party in Cambridgeshire at the 1924, 1929 and 1931 United Kingdom general elections, and then The Wrekin at the 1935 United Kingdom general election, and in the 1937 Plymouth Drake by-election. In 1925, he was elected to Cambridgeshire County Council. Although his farming was largely a hobby, he has been described as \\"almost... the party's official spokesman to the farming community\\". In the 1930s, Garratt worked for the Manchester Guardian, covering Indian nationalism, the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, and the Winter War. Based on his experiences, he wrote Mussolini's Roman Empire, and also edited The Legacy of India. During World War II, Garratt was placed in charge of a group of German volunteers doing war work for the British government. In April 1942, Stafford Cripps asked for him to visit him, in London; en route, Garratt was killed in a bomb explosion.

After the Athenians broke a truce with the Corinthians at Sybota, his primary goal was to defend Potidaea from an Athenian attack. He then went on to defend the Corinthian colony from Athens during the Battle of Potidaea in 432 BC, until he was left with no option but to leave the colony with the Chalcidians. In 430 BC he traveled to Thrace with Spartan envoys where they were discovered by Athenians and brought to Athens, by Athenian ambassadors, where they were promptly killed without a trial. After Aristeus' death, Athens seized Potidaea in 430/429 BC during the Peloponnesian War, the battles of Sybota and Potidaea being two main catalysts for the war.  Prelude to war  In 432 BC, Aristeus was appointed as commander of the Corinthian military expedition for the relief of their colony Potidaea, which had just seceded from Athens. He was able to recruit Corinthian volunteers and mercenaries from the rest of the Peloponnesus to fight alongside him due to his popularity, both domestically and in Potidaea. After the Battle of Sybota, in which the Corinthians fought a combined force of Athenians and Corcyraeans in 433 BC, Corinth was furious with the Athenians for fighting alongside Corcyraeans during a time of truce. The Athenians became worried that Potidaea would revolt against Athens and immediately sought to win over Corinth. Forty days after the revolt in Potidaea, Aristeus, along with 1600 hoplites and 400 light troops, arrived in Thrace and shortly thereafter encamped at Olynthus, where they prepared for battle.  Battle of Potidaea  Meanwhile Athens, informed that Aristeus and his troops were on their way to defend Potidaea, sent 2000 hoplites along with 40 ships to prepare to oppose him. Under the command of the general Callias and four of his colleagues, the Athenian troops first traveled to Macedonia, where they besieged Pydna. It was at this time that Athens, realizing the revolt in Potidaea and Aristeus' intention to defend it, forced Perdiccas, the Macedonian king, to return to his alliance with them and march on Potidaea. With the alliance with Perdiccas formalized, Athens withdrew its troops from Macedonia, via Beroea and Strepsa, and marched on Potidaea with 3000 hoplites and 600 Macedonian horsemen, with 70 ships following closely along the coast. After three days of advancing on Potidaea by short marches, the Athenian forces encamped at Gigonus. In their preparation for the Athenian attack on their city, the citizens of Potidaea and the Peloponnesians encamped at Olynthus and chose Aristeus as general of all the infantry. Perdiccas, who had deputed Iolaus as his general, left the alliance with Athens, returned to that with Potidaea, and was made commander of the allied cavalry. Aristeus' next move was to keep his infantrymen on the isthmus to await the Athenian attack. The Chalcidians and the other allies waited nearby, while the 200 cavalry from Perdiccas stayed in Olynthus to attack the Athenian rear, in case of an attack on Aristeus' infantry. By doing this, Aristeus placed the Athenian advance between the allied forces on the isthmus and at Olynthus. Knowing that Aristeus' infantry posed a threat to the Athenian advance, Callias and his colleagues sent away the Macedonian horsemen and a group of allies to prevent an attack from Olynthus, while the rest of the Athenians marched on Potidaea. Shortly after the Athenians arrived at the isthmus, the armies engaged. Aristeus' infantry, which consisted of Corinthians and other chosen men, routed the Athenian advance and pursued them for a considerable distance. However, the remaining army of Potidaeans and Peloponnesians met a different fate; they were routed by the Athenians and were forced to take refuge behind fortifications. When he returned from pursuing the Athenians, Aristeus realized the defeat of the rest of the army and was left to choose whether to go to Olynthus or to Potidaea. Once his men were assembled, Aristeus led them along the breakwater to Potidaea, while being attacked. Some perished, but most made it safely. Seeing this occur and battle signals raised, Potidaean allies from Olynthus began to advance to provide aid. The Macedonian horsemen successfully countered those troops. Predicting an Athenian victory, the Potidaeans retreated back within their walls, while the Macedonians, having seen the battle signals taken down, retreated to the Athenians, leaving no cavalry on either side. When the battle concluded, the Athenians set up a trophy and, under truce, allowed the Potidaeans to collect their dead, which numbered nearly 300. The Athenians lost 150 men, including their general, Callias.  After the battle  After the battle of Potidaea ended, Athenians built a wall on the Macedonian side of the isthmus, consolidating their forces there and leaving the Pallene side unmanned. Under the command of Phormio, 1600 hoplites were sent from Athens for reinforcement. Upon their arrival at Pallene, a new Athenian headquarters was constructed at Aphytis. Phormio's troops defeated the Potidaeans in the field, built a wall on the Pallene side, and deployed Athenian ships around the peninsula, thus besieging Potidaea by land and sea. Aristeus recognized that the peninsula was unsalvageable and instructed the remaining troops, except for 500 of them, to sail away. He attempted to convince his troops to let him stay in Potidaea but was not successful. After evading Athenian ships, he sailed away. Although the conflict was all but finished, Aristeus remained with the Chalcidians and successfully ambushed Athenians near Aphytis. In an attempt to buy mercenaries to fight for him, he was in communication with the Peloponnesus. Phormio ended the siege of Potidaea by sending his 1600 hoplites to destroy Chalcidice and Bottica. Athenians and Peloponnesians continued to debate their claim to Potidaea; their conflict on the isthmus would be a precursor to the Peloponnesian War.  Death  In the summer of 430 BC, Aristeus, along with a group of Spartans‚Äîincluding Aneristus, Nicolaus, Protodamus, Timagoras from Tegea, and Pollis from Argos‚Äîtraveled to Thrace to meet Sitalces, the son of the former Thracian king, Teres I, in an attempt to persuade the king to supply funds and betray his alliance to Athens. In particular, they wanted Sitalces' assistance to march yet again on Potidaea, which was occupied by Athenian forces, and to join them in the war against Athens. Athenian ambassadors happened to be with Sitalces at the time, and they convinced his son, Sadocus, to seize Aristeus and the other individuals as they traveled through Thrace to the ship in which they were to cross the Hellespont. It followed that Aristeus and the other individuals were handed over to the Athenian ambassadors and brought to Athens. When they arrived back in Athens, the Athenians were aware that Aristeus had commanded the Corinthians and others at Potidaea and refused to give them a trial, being afraid that, if he escaped, Aristeus would cause them to suffer again. Aristeus and the other envoys were killed immediately and cast into a pit, a familiar mode of death that the Spartans themselves were known for in the Peloponnesian War. In 430 BC, Potidaea was seized by Athens.

In addition to offering a sanctuary for native birds and other animals, the reserve preserves the largest remnant of coastal lowland swamp forest on the Kapiti Coast. NgƒÅ Manu contains aviaries housing native birds such as kƒÅkƒÅ, kƒÅkƒÅriki, scaup, whio and kea, enclosures with tuatara, and a nocturnal house with kiwi and morepork. Bird life in the reserve comprises over 50 different bird species, the most visible being common local birds such as kerer≈´, tui, black swan, paradise duck and pukeko. The reserve is not surrounded by a pest-exclusion fence, and as a result the native bush area of the reserve does not host any critically endangered animals, however, NgƒÅ Manu is regularly involved in wider conservation efforts and breeding programmes. History NgƒÅ Manu has been managed by the charitable NgƒÅ Manu Trust since 1974 and opened to the public in 1981. The site was chosen as it had a large remnant of coastal lowland swamp forest and was purchased by founding trustees Peter McKenzie, Prof. John Salmon and David Mudge with part of an inheritance from the late Sir John McKenzie. The well-known geologist and naturalist Charles Fleming later joined the project and extensive planting and additional landscaping was completed in the late 1970s. Today, NgƒÅ Manu also serves as an important \\"stepping stone\\" for birds travelling between the native forests of Kapiti Island and the Tararua Range. Visitor numbers have been helped by easier access and signposting on the Kapiti Expressway built in 2017. Visitor facilities Closer to the visitor centre, the reserve offers lawn areas and an arboretum of native trees. An education centre building was added in the 1990s, which is a popular destination for school trips and also available for hire as a venue. The reserve also offers small tours and individual experiences. A wheelchair-friendly loop track circles through the native bush home to some 700 native plant species, taking in some small lawn clearings and skirting the 3 small lakes and ponds in the reserve. The largest lake contains several small bush-covered islands connected with small wooden bridges, and there is a side track leading to a lookout tower overlooking the native bush.

Toponymy  As to toponymy, it has been suggested that Demosthenes referred to Corseia (ŒöŒøœÅœÉŒµŒØŒ±) in his speech On the False Embassy, a town located in the northwest of the region, bordering on Ozolian Locris;Demosthenes, On the False Embassy, 141. but in spite of the fact that the Athenian orator mentions Orchomenus, Coroneia and Tilphossaeum bordering on ŒöŒøœÅœÉŒµŒØŒ±, the citations of Harpocration,Harpocration, K77 the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, and Stephanus of Byzantium, have led the modern historiographers to seriously consider its location in southern Boeotia, hypothesized further by an inscription of Delphi containing a list of theorodokoi of Corseia from .Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum 36,500For more details, see Consequently, P. Roesch and other historians argue that the strategy of the Phocians to dominate the Boeotian coast through the fortification or occupation of cities during the Third Sacred War - a campaign reported by Diodorus Siculus and by Demosthenes \\\\- would not make sense to involve Corseia, a northern town far from the sea, since it did not meet the geographical and historical conditions referred to in the mentioned texts. In his choice of Corseae instead of Corsiea, P. Roesch considered five points: be in Boeotia, have some importance, be walled, have easy access from Phocis and constitute a penetration in central Boeotia toward Thebes. W. K. Pritchett and John M. Fossey disagree with √âtienne and Knoepfler. They argue that the craggy territory of Corseae made access difficult from neighboring towns and from Phocis, and they infer from passages of Xenophon, Pausanias, and Diodorus Siculus, that if in 371 BCE, the Spartan King Cleombrotus I was forced to return to Sparta from Phocis, marching through southern Boeotia, instead of crossing through Coroneia, it was because the Phocians controlled that city that dominated the central Boeotian route;Pritchett, W K (1991). Studies in Ancient Greek Topography , vol. I, edit. Brill, pp. 52-57. so they did not need to own corsairs, because from Corseia they not only enjoyed an extraordinary place to monitor the Locrian coast, but also because from there they could prevent a joint Locrian-Boeotian expedition against Orchomenus. The Spanish classical philologists, Juan Jos√© Torres Esbarranch and Juan Manuel Guzm√°n Hermida, place it near Opus and on the sea, in the area of Mount Helicon. In the year 346 BCE, it was destroyed by the Thebans, its walls demolished and like Orchomenus and Coronea perhaps it was subdued to slavery. Subsequently, it was rebuilt. Archaeology The demonym Corsieus (Œ∫ŒøœÅœÉŒπŒµœçœÇ) is recorded in a treaty signed with its neighbor Thisbae at the beginning of the 2nd century BCESupplementum Epigraphicum Graecum 3.342 and in an internal decree of proxenia.Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum 22.410 Another epigraphic finding shows that at the end of the 4th century BCE, it was not an independent polis (city-state), but belonged to the territory of Thespiae.Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum 24.361 and 30.441 The text also alludes to a local cult of Hera. Although the name of its territory is unknown, its size has been estimated at about . It was rebuilt not long after it was devastated in 346 BCE, as evidenced by archeology and the epigraphy of the place. The only written reference to its walls is provided by Diodorus in his description of the Phocian occupation of Corseae, Orchomenus and Coroneia during the Third Sacred War. Archaeological excavations have found remains of the walled perimeter: a trapezoidal wall section that protected the acropolis and the lower city, on its east, north and west sides. The south side was naturally defended with precipices. The fortifications are from the years after the Battle of Leuctra (371 BCE), and were surely demolished by the Theban troops in 346 BCE as Demosthenes affirms. Subsequently, before the end of the century, Corseae was fortified with isodomic ashlars. The walls enclosed residential neighborhoods occupying an area of about .; According to John Bintliff, the inhabited area would range from .

Biography Pomerance was born in Birmingham and studied at the Birmingham College of Art from 1928 to 1933. After graduation, Pomerance worked as a freelance commercial artist but also began exhibiting in group shows, most notably with the Sheffield Society of Artists of which she became a member. Her first solo exhibition was at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool in 1949. Further solo shows followed including at the Ben Uri Gallery, at the Leicester Galleries and also at the Molton and Redfern galleries. Notable works by Pomerance include The Sphere of Redemption cycle panels. She designed a stained glass window, Rebirth of the State of Israel, for the Singers Hill Synagogue in Birmingham. She displayed her ballet themes at Bristol Old Vic as part of the 21st anniversary celebrations of the Dementia Care Trust. Other exhibitions were held at the church of St Botolph without Aldgate, St James's Church, Piccadilly during the 1983 Piccadilly Festival, Nottingham Playhouse and at Crucible Theatre Sheffield. A retrospective exhibition of her work was held at St Mary's College, Durham in 1999 and a memorial exhibition, The Theme of Redemption, was held at Durham Cathedral in 2004. A similar exhibition was held in Durham during 2018 at Ushaw College. Works by Pomerance are held by a number of museums in Israel and in Britain by the Ben Uri Gallery, the Batley Art Gallery and by both Hull and Staffordshire local authorities. Pomerance's work differed from the mainstream of post-war British art. Throughout her life, she experienced spiritual visions which formed the basis of her dreamlike iconography and complex expressions. She explored and developed intense themes through her works such as War Vision, a powerful watercolour series that depicts themes of carnage, genocide, oppression and homelessness. Personal life Pomerance's father was Sol Levy, the founder of the Scala Cinema chain. In 1936 she married Ben Pomerance, who became vice-chairman of the furniture firm Waring & Gillow.

Background The album was a departure from the alternative dance and electro house style of his previous two albums and instead opted for a folk sound inspired by Joni Mitchell and Elliott Smith. The album focuses on Kele's experiences being a father despite being a gay man as well as reconnecting with his Nigerian heritage.

He was the son of the stone carver Pasquale Buhagiar, while his mother was Leonora Buttigieg, originally from Siƒ°ƒ°iewi. The family eventually moved to Malta's capital Valletta. Buhagiar had a workshop where the fellow painter Francesco Zahra probably began his training. Buhagiar and Zahra were close friends, and the latter's early work was heavily inspired from the former, such that their style was almost indistinguishable and that some works attributed to Zahra might actually be Buhagiar's. For example, The Holy Family with God the Father at the Tarxien parish church was formerly widely attributed to both artists but is now regarded as being Buhagiar's work. He married Anna Maria Cachia on 14 February 1719, and they had three children: Maria, Eleonora and Ferdinando, with the latter becoming a priest. Buhagiar died in Valletta on 21 March 1752 and was buried inside the Carmelite Church. Works Works attributed to Buhagiar can be found in a number of churches and chapels around the Maltese Islands.

It branches near its base, and has few leaves along its stems. The lower leaves are set oppositely, inverted lance-shaped, relatively large at 3‚Äì7 cm (1¬Ω‚Äì2¬æ in) long and ‚Öî‚Äì1¬º cm (¬º‚Äì¬Ω in) wide, and soon withering, while the higher ones are smaller and relatively narrower. In the axils of the leaves grow flower heads of 7‚Äì8 mm (about ‚Öì in) wide on stalks of up to 5 cm (2 in) long, topped with an involucre of about 5 mm (0.2 in) high and 4 mm (0.16 in) wide, consisting of eleven to thirteen bracts in two rows with bristles near the tip, eight to nine white or cream- coloured ligulate florets surrounding fourteen or fifteen deep purple disc florets. Flowers can be found in September and October. The species is an endemic species that can only be found in a small area along the west coast of the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Felicia josephinae is an annual herbaceous plant (germinating, flowering and setting seed just one time, before dying, all within one year) of 15‚Äì20 cm (6‚Äì8 in) high that branches regularly from near its base upward. The stems and leaves are prickly due to short and long hairs that each consist of several cells, mixed with glands on short stalks in the upper parts of the stems. The lower leaves are set oppositely, are inverted lance-shaped, relatively large at 3‚Äì7 cm (1¬Ω‚Äì2¬æ in) long and ‚Öî‚Äì1¬º cm (¬º‚Äì¬Ω in) wide, have few prickly hairs and soon wither. The higher leaves are narrower, lance- to line-shaped, mostly alternately set, and prickly due to long and short hairs. The flower heads are set individually at the end of flower stalks of up to 5 cm (2 in) long, that stand in the axils of the leaves and carry few, scattered and very small awl- shaped bracts. The heads contain both female ray and bisexual and male disc florets (so-called heterogamous capitula). At the base of the head, surrounding and protecting the florets before opening, are two whorls of sepal-like bracts or scales (or phyllaries) that together make up the involucre, which is narrowly egg-shaped, about 5 mm (0.2 in) high and 4 mm (0.16 in) wide, consisting of eleven to thirteen bracts in two rows with bristles near the tip. The phyllaries are 4‚Äì5 mm (0.16‚Äì0.20 in) long, with papery margins and a row of hairs near the tip. The outer whorl of phyllaries are line-shaped, about 1 mm (0.04 in) wide with narrow papery margins, while the inner phyllaries are inverted lance-shaped, about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) wide, having broad margins. The communal base (or receptacle) on which the individual florets are implanted is flat, deeply pitted, and lacks receptacular bracts (or palea) at the foot of the florets. The eight or nine white or cream-coloured ray florets surrounding the disc are female only, have a cylindrical tube of 2¬Ω‚Äì3 mm (0.10‚Äì0.12 in) long with some glandular hairs, at the top changing into a spreading, elliptic or inverted lance-shaped blade of 10‚Äì12 mm (0.40‚Äì0.48 in) long and 4‚Äì6 mm (0.16‚Äì0.24 in) wide with four veins running along its length. At the base of each ray floret is a narrowly elliptic ovary with hairs pressed to its surface. From it rises a style that is circular in cross-section, ending in two pointy, line-shaped branches of about 1 mm (0.04 in) long, its outer margins functioning as stigma. There is no pappus. The one-seeded, indehiscent, dry fruit (called cypsela) is flattened oval in shape, 2¬Ω‚Äì3 mm (0.10‚Äì0.12 in) long and about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) in diameter, with thickened margins, its surfaces and margins being covered with pale brown hairs pressed against its surface. The fourteen or fifteen deep purple disc florets are bisexual, but those in the center of the head do not develop seed. The tube has glandular hairs, is cylinder-shaped, 2¬Ω‚Äì3 mm long, widening a bit towards the upper end, where it splits into five back- curving triangular lobes of about 1 mm long and ¬æ mm wide at its base, with thickened margins. Like in all Asteraceae, the five anthers have merged into a hollow tube through which the style grows with the floret opens, while gathering the pollen on its shaft. The anthers produce cream-coloured pollen, are themselves deep blue, about 2 mm long, including the oval, slightly keeled appendage at the top, while the base is blunt without an appendage. The ovary under the tube florets are narrowly elliptic, also with hairs pressed against its surface. It is topped by a purple style that is circular in cross-section, ending in two pointy, recurved, flattened, line-shaped branches of about 1 mm (0.04 in) long, its outer margins functioning as stigma. In the central florets the style ends in triangular grainy branches. The pappus on each of the cypselas of the tube florets consists of one row of about 25 spreading, short, stiff, hooked bristles of 3‚Äì4 mm (0.12‚Äì0.16 in) long but feathery near middle, and merged at their base, forming a short, white collar. The cypselas are identical to those of the ray florets.  Differences with related species  Most Felicia species have a yellow disc, and blue, purple or pink, rarely white or yellow ray florets. F. josephinae, F. heterophylla and a form of F. amoena subsp. latifolia have deep purple disc florets. From these two taxa, F. josephinae differs by its broad creamy ray florets, which are more narrow and purple in F. heterophylla and narrower and blue in F. amoena subsp. latifolia.  Taxonomy  As far as known, Felicia josephinae was first collected, between Clanwilliam and Elands Bay, in September 1933, by poet, medical doctor and plant hunter C. Louis Leipoldt. Further specimens were collected from a small stretch along the coast between Elands Bay and Lambert's Bay. These finds were either considered a new, unnamed species or, tentatively as some variation of Chareis heterophylla (currently Felicia heterophylla), with which it shares the deep purple colour of the disc florets, but from which it differs in having whitish ligulate florets instead of medium bluish purple. Somehow J√ºrke Grau, who revised the genus Felicia in 1973, hasn't come across any of the collections of this species. It was described by John Charles Manning and Peter Goldblatt only in 2002, who named it after South African botanist and Asteraceae specialist Josephine Beyers. Synonyms have not been recorded. F. josephinae has been assigned to the section Neodetris.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Felicia josephinae only occurs in a small area on the west coast of the Western Cape province of South Africa between Lambert's Bay in the north, Elands Bay in the south, and the Sandberg, east of Leipoldtville. It grows on dunes and hills in a vegetation type called Strandveld Succulent Karoo, which occurs on chalky sands in the coastal plain, dominated by sparse shrubs, in particular Salvia lanceolata, skilpadbessie bos Muraltia spinosa, and several succulent Euphorbia species. Many annuals appear seasonally between the shrubs in the open spaces, including many Scrophulariaceae such as Alonsoa unilabiata, Hemimeris racemosa, Lyperia tristis, Nemesia affinis and N. bicomis, and the daisies Arctotis hirsuta, Dimorphotheca pluvialis and Trichogyne verticillata. F. josephinae is restricted to the very southern part of the Strandveld Succulent Karoo, with shallow sands overlying more compact sandstone-derived substrates. This species grows in an area in which the rains fall almost exclusively during the winter. The seeds germinate at the start of the rains in the autumn and are ready to flower in spring.  Conservation  Felicia josephinae is known from eight locations and considered a vulnerable species because of its declining population, which is seriously threatened by loss of habitat due to ongoing expansion of rooibos and potato cultivation and overgrazing.

The event commemorated the sport of lucha libre becoming allowed in the State of Mexico, with the first lucha libre show held in the state taking place in December 1962. Over the years IWRG has on occasion celebrated the anniversary, although not consistently holding an anniversary show every year. In the main event Ray Mendoza Jr. had come out of retirement to face Mr. Electro in a Lucha de Apuestas, bet match, with both competitors risking their hair on the outcome of the match. Mr Electro was disqualified in the third fall, causing him to lose the match and his hair as well. In the semi-main event Black Drag√≥n and Oficial Rayan lost a Relevos Suicida match to the teams of Oficial Spector/Tortuga Teelo and Oficial Liderk/Tortuga Mike. As a result of the loss the two were scheduled to wrestle each other at the Arena Naucalpan 40th Anniversary Show on December 17, in a Lucha de Apuestas match for their masks. The show included five additional matches. Production Background The history of lucha libre, or professional wrestling in Mexico goes all the way back to the early 1900s where individual promoters would hold shows on a local basis in various Mexican states. In 1933 Salvador Lutteroth created Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL; Spanish for \\"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\\") and in subsequent years took EMLL to a national level. In the 1930s and 1940s various Mexican starts to create lucha libre commissions, often as an extension of the existing Boxing commissions, responsible for overview of lucha libre in each state, licensing wrestlers and ensuring the rules are being enforced. In the State of Mexico lucha libre was not officially sanctioned in late 1962, with the first lucha libre show in the State of Mexico held in December 1962. The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has on occasion held a major show in December to commemorate the \\"birth\\" of Lucha Libre in their home state. It is unclear exactly when IWRG started to mark the Anniversary, records confirm that they held a show to commemorate the event starting in 2010 commemorating the 48th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico, possibly prior to that. The 2017 show was for the 55th anniversary and was held on December 3, 2013 in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico where IWRG holds almost all of their major lucha libre shows. Storylines The 55th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico event featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event After Dr. Cerebro pinned Imposible to win the match for his side (which included Alas de Acero and Bandido) he challenged Imposible to defend the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship at a later date. The fourth match of the night was part of a long-running IWRG vs. \\"Indy Nation\\" storyline where \\"Indy Nation\\" represented a number of wrestlers from the Independent circuit in Mexico, claiming they were better than the IWRG wrestlers. On the night \\"Indy Nation representatives Centvri√≥n, Fly Warrior and S√©ptimo Rayo defeated IWRG representatives Diablo Jr., Dinamic Black and Emperador Azteca, all graduates of the IWRG wrestling school. In the closing moments of the match Fulgor I came to the ring and helped Indy Nation win the match. Afterwards, the group was joined by a masked man for their victory celebration. Moments later that masked man revealed himself to be Bandido, attacking Indy Nation. Afterwards Bandido declared that he, Emperador Azteca and Ciclon Ramirez was forming a trio to oppose Indy Nation. The fifth match of the night marked the first time Villano V's youngest son wrestled under the ring name Rokambole Jr., having previously competed as Kaving. Rokambole Jr, his brother Villano V Jr. and their uncle Villano IV lost to the team of Sharlie Rockstar and Los Traumas (Trauma I and Trauma II) after Sharly Rockstar hit Villano V Jr. with a foul while the referee was distracted. The losing team in the semi-final Relevos Suicida match would be forced to put their masks on the line at the subsequent Arena Naucalpan 40th Anniversary Show scheduled for December 17. The teams for the match were Oficial Spector and Tortuga Teelo, Oficial Liderk and Tortuga Mike, Oficial Rayan and Black Drag√≥n. While both members of Los Tortugas Ninja refused to wrestle against each other, opting to tag out instead, none of the Los Oficiales Elite members had such problems, wrestling each other to keep their mask safe. the Mike/Liderk team was the first team to score a pinfall and escape the match, followed by Teelo/Spector, which meant that Oficial Rayan and Black Drag√≥n would risk their masks at a later date. For the main event, the semi-retired Ray Mendoza Jr. was able to keep his hair due to a mistake by his opponent Mr. Electro. In the latter stages of the match Mr. Electro tried to his Mendoza Jr. with a steel chair, but accidentally ended up hitting the referee instead. This caused Mr. Electro to be disqualified, even after his brother, Sharly Rockstar, tried to argue that the match should continue. In the end, Mr. Electro reluctantly allowed for his hair to be shaved off.

Initially designed as a First World War memorial and dedicated in June 1924, it was later expanded in scope to also serve as a memorial of later wars.  History and design  Memorials to servicemen who died in the First World War were erected soon after the end of the conflict. Plans to build a permanent memorial at the University of Reading unfolded in 1919, when William Macbride Childs, the principal of the college, printed a pamphlet suggesting several ideas. The final design was ultimately made by Herbert Maryon, a teacher of sculpture at the university; he would later gain broad recognition in a second career at the British Museum, where he conserved many of the finds from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, termed \\"the most important single discovery in British archaeology.\\" His initial proposal, made in 1919, was for a tower of that would have cost between ¬£5,000 and ¬£10,000. The funds could not be raised, and in 1923 Maryon proposed a structure of half that height. Construction began that November, and the memorial was dedicated the following June. The finished memorial, which cost ¬£2,750, is a brick tower with a clock, a bell, and a bronze roll of honour listing the names of more than 140 people who died in the war. The scope of the memorial was expanded following the Second World War, and in May 1953 a panel with more than 70 names of the dead from that conflict was unveiled. It now also commemorates those who died in the war in Afghanistan; in 2012 a plaque was unveiled honouring Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe, , a 1991 graduate of the University whose 2009 death made him the highest-ranking officer of the British Army killed in action since the Falklands War.

The main event of the show was the eponymous Gran Cruzada tournament, a 30-man Battle Royal with the winner earning a championship match for his weight division. Eterno outlasted everyone else and afterward announced that he was going to challenge Rel√°mpago for the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship. Background In 2011 the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) started to award a championship belt to the winner of their annual Rey del Ring (\\"King of the Ring\\") tournament that could be defended between the annual tournaments. As a result, IWRG also added an annual La Gran Cruzada (\\"The Great Crusade\\") tournament about halfway between the Rey del Ring tournaments. Like the Rey del Ring the eponymous Gran Cruzada match is a 30-man elimination match similar in concept to the WWE's annual Royal Rumble match. The winner of the Gran Cruzada tournament would become the number one contender for the Rey del Ring Championship with a title match at a later date. The La Gran Cruzada shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2017 La Gran Cruzada show was the sixth time that IWRG has promoted a show under that name. For the 2017 version of the tournament IWRG the winner would get a championship match for his weight class, instead of the traditional IWRG Rey del Ring Championship match. Event The La Gran Cruzada event featured three professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. For the 2017 La Gran Cruzada, 30 wrestlers competed in a battle royal where a wrestler would be eliminated once he goes over the top rope and his feet touch the floor. This elimination rule meant that Aram√≠s, Alas de Acero and Freelance all eliminated themselves when they dove out of the ring onto an opponent on the floor. The final four were Emperador Azteca, Eterno, Golden Magic and Imposible, with Eterno ending up as the winner. Following the match he announced that he was going to challenge for the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship, held by his long time rival Rel√°mpago at the time.

It was his largest painting to date.Strazdes, 164 The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is praised for its dramatic depiction of the threatening mood of blackening skies and eerily illuminated terrain prior to the storm itself. The painting has been connected to mounting tensions before the Civil War, which were often expressed in terms of natural imagery. One of a series of paintings by Heade of coastal landscapes, this work was based on a sketch that Heade made of an approaching storm on Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Here, a fisherman sits by the shore watching the storm approach; there is a faint red bolt of lightning in the left part of the sky. To his left are a dog, an iron kettle, and a spread-out boat sail. Another fisherman is rowing toward the shore, having left his sailboat out on the bay. His placement in the composition helps provide a sense of distance and a narrative for the scene. Strazdes suggests that \\"Heade, by refusing to prettify his scenery by association, was attempting to inject into his artistic vision a serious, monumental simplicity it had not previously possessed.\\"Strazdes, 165 The composition is very open, as if seen through a wide-angle lens, and relatively empty. The swathes of dark color are novel for a landscape work. The long horizon is an influence from Heade's contemporary, Frederic Edwin Church (with whom he shared a studio), as in paintings such as Niagara. Heade, Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay (1868) Numerous pentimenti suggest that Heade altered the composition over time; for example, the hills on the horizon were originally larger and more jagged. Records suggest that Approaching Thunder Storm was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1860. In 1868, Heade painted Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay, a similar composition.

They alerted sheriff's deputies Joe Sabas and Dennis (misreported as Lenny) Carroll, who had a team investigate the object, which proved to be a Ferrari Dino. It was initially reported that the car had been stolen in 1974, as had been reported, and buried by the thieves. Later it transpired that the owner, Rosendo Cruz, apparently conspired to commit insurance fraud with the supposed thieves. They were supposed to destroy the Dino, but instead hid it, intending to dig it up later, and forgot where it was buried. Aftermath One Brad Howard purchased the car from Farmers Insurance, to which ownership had defaulted, and restored it for his own use. As of 2019, it was in perfect running condition in Howard's possession. It was easily restored and has been very active since 1978 when he purchased it.

Since 2016, she has been Chair of the Mental Health Unit at the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and has written columns about the psychological consequences of the Israeli occupation in Palestine since the 2000s. Inspired by anticolonial psychiatrist Frantz Fanon, her areas of interest include mental health, colonialism and universal human rights.  Biography  Samah Jabr was born to a Jerusalemite family on August 8, 1976. She graduated from Al-Quds University (Jerusalem) in 2001, a member of the first cohort of the Faculty of Medicine. She gained advanced training in psychiatry in France and the United Kingdom, as well as in clinical research in the United States. She specialized in psychotherapy and was trained at the Israel Psychoanalytic Institute of Jerusalem. Jabr is one of 22 psychiatrists practicing in the West Bank, and among the first Palestinian women in this profession.  Career  Jabr serves as Palestine Medical Director for the Palestinian Medical Education Initiative (PMED), and practices as a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist in the private and public sectors. Her research is published in both Palestinian and international peer- reviewed journals. She co-wrote, with American child psychiatrist Elizabeth Berger, a study focusing on \\"clinical transference and countertransference across the Israeli/Palestinian divide\\" and one on \\"the survival and well-being of the Palestinian people under occupation\\". Jabr has taught at various Palestinian universities and is a supervisor at the George Washington University (Washington). She is a fellow at the Centre for Science and Policy (University of Cambridge). She works as a consultant and a trainer for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders (MSF). A volunteer for the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), Jabr contributes to establishing reports based on the testimonies of victims. In the documentary Beyond the Frontlines: Tales of Resistance and Resilience in Palestine (Alexandra Dols, 2017, France), she explains that the objective is to let the perpetrators know that their acts of torture are known, reported and filed, so that they may be held accountable.Beyond the Frontlines: Tales of Resistance and Resilience in Palestine, Alexandra Dols, 2017, Hybrid Pulse, 113 minutes. Jabr has been a regular guest of Palestinian radio station Nisaa FM and of Panarab channel Al Araby, where she has been interviewed on topics including mental health, the rights of people with special needs, marginalization and abuse. Jabr has published columns in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs and the Middle East Monitor. Her perspective is that \\"the Israeli occupation is not only a political issue, but indeed a mental health problem\\". Jabr has also been a guest of organizations supporting the Palestinian people in France, where she has been invited by local association Les amis de Jayyous, as well as national Association France-Palestine Solidarit√© (AFPS) and Union juive fran√ßaise pour la paix (UJFP). Institutions including the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), the Tavistock & Portman NHS Foundation Trust and the Institut de Recherche et d'√âtudes M√©diterran√©e Moyen-Orient (iReMMO, Paris) have had her as a speaker. According to Jabr, and in accordance with Fanon's views, one of the core challenges of the Palestinian struggle for national liberation is the necessity to build \\"a psychological understanding and culture that can liberate the people‚Äôs minds, parallel to the liberation of the land\\".  Selected perspectives   Suicide and sacrifice  Jabr distinguishes between the act of suicide, driven by despair, and the act of sacrifice, drawn by hope. > Suicidal actions are often egocentric because the individual‚Äôs spark of life > has lost its meaning in interpersonal terms. In contrast, the self- > sacrificing person‚Äìeven on the pathway to death‚Äìmay be full of hope, indeed > perhaps too much so. The act of self-sacrifice often involves an altruistic > dedication to others and an eagerness to improve their future chances. Their > hope is to extinguish their own soul in the service of giving light to > others and brighten the road ahead. Regarding mental health statistics for Palestine, and post-traumatic stress disorder data specifically, Jabr questions the methodology and definitions given by the World Health Organization. \\"It‚Äôs important to develop your own mental health standards\\", she says.  Colonial privilege  In December 2017, Jabr called out to the International Association of Relational Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy (IARPP), requesting that they reconsider the location of their 2019 annual conference, Tel Aviv. Such an international event, she argued, \\"shields Israel from public exposure of its atrocities\\". The IARPP board would not hear her arguments. > \\"In a narrow sense, we are not a political organisation,\\" claims the IARPP > leadership, giving them the luxury of distancing their psychological > experience from the occupation while at the same time consuming the > privileges of the occupation. For Palestinians, there is no such luxury; the > occupation that deprives us of our loved ones, spies on our private > relationships, strips our clothes from us , steals years from our lives, > deprives us of our health and confronts us with continuous grief and > humiliation, this is in every sense very personal and very psychological. > Only those who side with the powerful are keen to ignore the dialectical > relationship between the psychological and political. The IARPP position triggered a petition, initiated and circulated together with the Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP). A group of Palestinian mental health clinicians with Israeli citizenship called out to the IARPP directly, as well as more than 30 members of the Israeli organization Psychoactive - Mental Health Professionals for Human Rights (Hebrew: ◊§◊°◊ô◊õ◊ï◊ê◊ß◊ò◊ô◊ë - ◊ê◊†◊©◊ô ◊ï◊†◊©◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊®◊ô◊ê◊ï◊™ ◊î◊†◊§◊© ◊ú◊û◊¢◊ü ◊ñ◊õ◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ê◊ì◊ù).  Responsibility  In November 2015, Jabr launched a call to mental health professional worldwide to side with the Palestinian people, along with the UK/USA Palestine Mental Health Network. The petition is a reminder that her professional community has a mission \\"to promote the integrity of the individual\\", and that \\"preconditions for this are social justice and the enjoyment of universal human rights\\". > We call upon mental health professionals to engage in sociopolitical > solidarity with the people of Palestine as a therapeutic position. > Dedicating ourselves to this work while the occupation continues will give > us the insights we will need in the future, as facilitators involved in the > process of reconciliation. Laying down a foundation of involvement during a > time of crisis prepares us for participating in a resolution to the crisis > that will bring genuine redress, justice, and full civil rights to the > people of Palestine.  Awards and honors  Jabr's research in biochemistry was granted the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Award in 1998. In 1999, she benefited from the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) Program at the Iowa State University, and later received a scholarship from the Dubai Harvard Foundation for Medical Research (DHFMR) in 2014. She is a fellow at the Centre for Science and Policy (University of Cambridge). In 2001, Jabr received the Media Monitors Network's Award for her articles on the Second Intifada, and she was elected ‚ÄúPersonality of the Year‚Äù by the readers of French Muslim website Oumma.com in 2015.  Portrayal in media  Jabr is portrayed in the documentary feature film Beyond the Frontlines: Tales of Resistance and Resilience in Palestine (2017), by French director Alexandra Dols. The film received the Sunbird Award for best documentary at the Palestinian festival, Days of Cinema. Beyond the Frontlines introduces its audience to sumud (Arabic: ÿµŸÖŸàÿØ), a concept that is both close to and different from the one of resilience. Jabr stresses that this word has been used by Palestinians since their struggle against the British occupation. She describes resilience as \\"oriented towards a state of mind\\" while sumud includes \\"an orientation to action\\" as well. Sumud means \\"maintaining a steadfast defiance to subjugation and occupation\\", and has a decisive collective dimension, for it also suggests \\"maintaining [‚Ä¶] moral and social solidarity.\\" The book Derri√®re les fronts. Chroniques d'une psychiatre psychoth√©rapeute palestinienne sous occupation (PMN Editions and Hybrid Pulse, 2018) presents a collection of Jabr's columns translated into French. In its review, newspaper Le Monde diplomatique, stated that Jabr, \\"drawing on her clinical observations and nourished by Frantz Fanon, allows us to see the extent of the pathologies that affect the individual and threaten social cohesion, as a direct consequence of 'the realm of the murderously absurd' imposed but the occupying power\\". Jabr appears in two other feature films. In Afterward (2018), Jerusalem-born and New York-based psychoanalyst Ofra Bloch confronts her own feelings about, and the tensions between, the genocide of European Jews and the expulsion of Palestinians from their land in 1948, known as the Nakba. In Fanon, hier, aujourd'hui (2018), French-Algerian director Hassane Mezine explores the life and legacy of Frantz Fanon, by interviewing past and contemporary activists who have struggled against injustice in various countries around the world.

History During the Franco-Prussian War, the breech-loaded Prussian cannons easily outclassed their muzzle-loaded French rivals. After the war, the Prussian Army replaced its 15 cm C/61 and C/64 cannons with the new 15 cm Ring Kanone C/72. The French also rearmed and their new breech-loaded Canon de 155 L mle 1877 had nearly twice the range of the C/72. During the 1880s Krupp began designing a replacement for the C/72 which would retain the same caliber as the C/72 and would feature a barrel 30 calibers in length rather than the 23 calibers of its predecessor. The new gun was designated the 15 cm Ring Kanone C/92 and could have been introduced as early as 1889 but the development of smokeless powder and new high-explosive shells necessitated design changes and the new guns weren't introduced until 1892. C/92's were assigned to fortress and siege artillery battalions of the Imperial German Army. Each artillery battery consisted of four guns with four batteries per battalion. Design The C/92 was a typical built-up gun constructed of steel with a central rifled tube, reinforcing layers of hoops, and trunnions. The guns used a predecessor of Krupp's horizontal sliding-block breech known as a cylindro-prismatic breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The C/92 was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns such as the Russian 6-inch siege gun M1904. Like many of its contemporaries, the C/92 had a tall and narrow box trail carriage built from bolted iron plates with two wooden 12-spoke wheels. The carriages were tall because the guns were designed to sit behind a parapet with the barrel overhanging the front in the fortress artillery role or behind a trench or berm in the siege role. Like its contemporaries, the C/92's carriage did not have a recoil mechanism or a gun shield. However, when used in a fortress the guns could be connected to an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on a concrete firing platform and a hook on the carriage between the wheels. For siege gun use a wooden firing platform could be assembled ahead of time and the guns could attach to the same type of recoil mechanism. A set of wooden ramps were also placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by gravity. There was also no traverse so the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire. To facilitate towing on soft ground and lessen recoil the wheels were often fitted with Bonagente grousers patented by the Italian major Crispino Bonagente. These consisted of twelve rectangular plates connected with elastic links and are visible in many photographs of World War I artillery from all of the combatants. For transport, the gun was broken down into two loads and for towing by horse teams or artillery tractors.  Balkan Wars  C/92's were used by both the Bulgarians and Ottoman forces during the Balkan Wars. It's also possible that Albania, the Kingdom of Greece, the Kingdom of Montenegro, the Kingdom of Romania, and the Kingdom of Serbia may have either bought C/92's or captured them from Ottoman forces. It is also likely they were used by Ottoman forces during the Italo-Turkish War.  World War I  The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Since the C/92 was heavier and wasn't designed with field use in mind it was employed as a fortress gun. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. The theorists hadn't foreseen that trenches, barbed wire, and machine guns had robbed them of the mobility they had been counting on and like in the Franco-Prussian and Russo-Turkish war the need for high- angle heavy artillery reasserted itself. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell and that meant emptying the fortresses and scouring the depots for guns held in reserve. It also meant converting coastal artillery and naval guns to siege guns by either giving them simple field carriages or mounting the larger pieces on rail carriages. A combination of factors led the Germans to issue C/92's to their frontline troops: *An underestimation of artillery losses during the first two years of the war and an inadequate number of replacement guns being produced. *Many artillery pieces were neither tall enough or capable of the high-angle fire necessary to fire from entrenched positions. *Few light field-artillery pieces had the range or fired a large enough projectile to be useful in an indirect fire role. The C/92 could be considered a dubious upgrade from the C/72 because at the time of their introduction they were virtually obsolescent due to the invention of hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanisms and the introduction of separate loading quick fire ammunition. Also despite having a barrel 7 calibers longer and using smokeless propellant the improvement in range was only . Although new guns with superior performance were introduced the C/92's remained in service until the end of the war due to the number in service, a shortage of heavy artillery and a lack of replacements.  Ammunition  The C/92 fired a variety of separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. * Common incendiary shell - cast iron shell filled with black powder. * Shrapnel shell - with 900 balls. * M1914 shrapnel shell - with 1,225 balls. *High explosive - with Amatol filling. * High explosive - with TNT filling.

The Association for Women in Computing awarded her an Ada Lovelace Award in 2000. She attended Philadelphia High School for Girls and graduated in Mathematics from University of Pennsylvania in 1950. During her first job interview with an insurance company, Koss, who was engaged at the time, was rejected for the reason that married women will have children and leave. She worked at Eckert‚ÄìMauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC) under Grace Hopper, programming the UNIVAC I. Her first big project was the development of what has become known as the 'Editing Generator', a sophisticated program to automatically format data for printing. Being able to create margins, headings and page numbers on the fly, Koss was the first programmer to attempt computer based word processing. During her time at EMCC she also wrote some of the first sorting programs and with Hopper wrote the first compiler. After working for several other companies (including Burroughs, Remington Rand, Philco and CDC) Koss moved to Harvard University where she stayed for 27 years until she retired in 1994, having been Associate Director of the Office for Information Technology and the University's Information Security Officer. Her colleague Jean Bartik recalled that Koss had become pregnant and was expected to leave her post, but she approached Hopper with the idea of what is now known as telecommuting, and Hopper encouraged her to stay on and to work from home as necessary. She negotiated similar arrangements in several subsequent posts. In 1997 she was given a Pioneer Award, one of seven women to be so honoured, at the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing.

She was born to Isobel Ince and Douglas Ince, a director of a Glasgow firm. Working as a consultant at Southampton Hospital, she made an early link in her research between ship workers dying of mesothelioma and asbestos exposure on ships, before the cause of this illness had been fully determined. She took part in the Round-the-Island race at Hayling Island in her sixties.  Personal life  Dr. Rosemary Margaret Warren Bamforth, was born Rosemary Ince on 19 October 1924 in Glasgow from mother Isobel Ince and father Douglas Ince, director of an engineering company. She was one of two children with her brother David Ince, air force pilot during WWII. Bamforth met her husband John Bamforth, while they both worked as doctors at Southampton General Hospital and they got married in 1960. Together, they had two daughters and a son. Rosemary Bamforth died on the 17 April 2018 at the age of 93.  Education  Rosemary Bamforth attended school in Glasgow at Laurel Bank, followed by Beacon School in Bridge of Allan then attended the Cheltenham Ladies College. Bamforth planned on studying medicine at the University of Glasgow and applied at the age of sixteen. She was politely rejected and asked to apply again once she was seventeen. In 1941, she joined instead the Women's Royal Naval Service. Bamforth returned to studying medicine after the Second World War and matriculated in 1946 at the University of Glasgow, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Medecine in 1951 thanks to a Further Education and Training Grant.  Military service  A modern reconstruction of the Bombe machine that she supervised Rosemary Bamforth completed her initial WRNS at Balloch by Loch Lomond and was then posted to Outstation Eastcote in Hillingdon, one of the outstations of Bletchley Park, where she was taught teleprinting. She moved from there to the Bletchley outstation at Stanmore, before eventually joining the team of Hut 11 in Bletchley Park itself, working on the Turing-Welchman Bombe machines. Bamforth had to keep these details of her military service secret until the mid-1970s when the history of Bletchley Park was declassified.  Career  After graduating, Rosemary Bamforth built her medical experience at both hospitals in the United States (McGill University and Meadowbrook Hospital in Hempstead) and the UK, where she practised at hospitals in London, Southampton and Portsmouth. Bamforth specialised as a pathologist and during her time in the United States, she became a recognised specialist in the analysis and diagnosis of cancer from the study of tissue samples. Whilst working at Southampton Hospital, working at the hospital as a senior registrar, Rosemary Bamforth made the link between a number of ship workers dying of mesothelioma and asbestos exposure on ships. She delivered a paper on her findings to Southampton doctors. Her conclusions raised controversy in the profession at the time, but were later backed up by subsequent research into Asbestosis.

Plot Seven-year- old Chloe Lewis has spent her entire life confined inside an abandoned house with her father Henry, who forbids her from leaving under the threat of being killed by \\"the bad men\\". Despite her father's warnings, Chloe longs to experience the world outside her home and desires a maternal figure in her life, due to never knowing her deceased mother Mary. To help Chloe have a normal life, Henry seeks to educate her on general social behavior so she will one day be able to pose as a member of the neighboring Reed family. Chloe observes strange occurrences in the house, such as Henry expelling blood from his eyes and a ghost-like female figure she sometimes encounters in her closet. Over time, she learns about \\"abnormals\\", who are individuals with superhuman abilities who are hunted by the government and confined in an underground facility known as Madoc Mountain. When Chloe eventually manages to leave the house, she discovers her own abnormal power of telepathy at the prodding of an elderly ice cream truck driver. Chloe soon learns that the elderly man is her maternal grandfather Alan. Alan believes that his daughter Mary, Chloe's mother, is still alive, and Chloe soon realizes that the \\"ghost\\" in her closet is actually her mother Mary being held at Madoc Mountain. It is revealed that Henry and Alan are also abnormals, identified by their bleeding eyes, with Henry using his time-altering powers to cause only a few months to pass outside of the house during the several years he and Chloe have resided there. Upon discovering that Chloe left the house and has been in contact with Alan, Henry brings her to the home of the neighboring Reed family, who have entered into a prior agreement to care for Chloe in exchange for cash. When the Reed matriarch Nancy becomes concerned over Chloe's unusual behaviour, Chloe uses her abilities on Nancy, causing Nancy to opt-out of the agreement with Henry. Nancy subsequently contacts the Abnormal Defense Force (ADF) to apprehend Chloe and her family, but Chloe uses her powers to trick the ADF agents into believing that the Reeds are abnormals, and they kill Nancy. Using her telepathic abilities, Chloe begins to help Mary escape from Madoc Mountain, but is hindered by the arrival of ADF Agent Cecelia Ray at the house. When Henry and Alan attempt to deal with her, the agent reveals to Henry that she knows the truth about him and his daughter and a drone strike will be ordered on the house if they kill her. Ray offers to place Chloe under governmental care, but upon realizing Henry and Alan are stalling, a scuffle ensues that leads to Ray killing Alan and mortally wounding Henry before she is killed by Chloe. Henry manages to delay the ADF agents long enough for Chloe to ensure Mary's escape from Madoc Mountain, then uses his abilities to manipulate time and carry Chloe out of the house just before it is destroyed by the drone strike. After Henry dies from his injuries, Mary arrives using her flight abilities and kills the remaining ADF agents. Mary promises to keep Chloe safe, but Chloe refuses to continue hiding, believing that no one can stop them from living wherever they want. Moved by her daughter's confidence, Mary agrees and the pair fly away.

Improvising upon an electrical prototype by Oskar Vierling, the design was executed around 1922, and the first of the set was marketed in 1931 to critical acclaim. The mechanics of the piano were implemented by the C. Bechstein company and the valve electronics were created by Siemens & Halske. The design belonged to a newer generation of electric pianos that eliminated the presence of any sound board. Description Keyboard transmission scheme for electric radio piano, describing how the micro hammer is connected to the main hammer Pickup mechanism Smaller than the dimensions of an ordinary grand piano, the Neo- Bechstein measured about in length and belonged to a newer generation of electric pianos that eliminated the presence of any sound board. Thinner and shorter strings were grouped into 18 clusters of 5 strings each. The clusters all converged towards a pickup followed by a membrane-less microphone. The oscillations were correspondingly transformed into electrical signals in a varying alternating current, which was made to pass through an adjustable electronic circuit comprising electron tubes, capacitors, resistors, etc., that acted as a filter. The filtered signal was then amplified with a three- tube valve amplifier and broadcast through a pre-built loudspeaker. The absence of a sound board and its substitution by electric amplification also meant a lighter framework and a lighter hammer action, which troubled conventional piano players. This led to the usage of usual-sized hammers which struck a rail and which in turn drove a much smaller micro-hammer into the string itself. The micro hammers were invented by Hans Driescher, an employee of Nernst. The instrument had two pedals. The right pedal acted upon the amplifier and controlled the volume levels, which - coupled with the increased sustenance power of the instrument due to its lack of a sound board - gave rise to organ-like expressive possibilities. The left pedal generated either \\"cembalo\\" or \\"celesta\\" sound. The instrument also had a speaker-cabinet fitted with a radio and a phonograph. Sound The resulting sound was noted to be distinctly different from that of an acoustic piano. The absence of a sound board coupled with the usage of micro-hammers not only led to a reduction in sound-amplification that increased the quality of sound but also lessened damping, producing an increase in its sustaining power. The Neo-Bechstein was one of the pioneer devices to feature a clear demarcation between the musical instrument itself and the loudspeaker, in that the mechanics of the piano were no longer involved in the direct production of sound, unlike existing electric pianos. Furthermore, the quality of the loudspeakers was good enough to not have any characteristic sound of their own. The instrument ushered in a new stage in acoustics development, wherein microphones and loudspeakers functioned well enough in stand-alone manner to be exploited for different approaches at the same time (reproducing and supporting). Manufacture The Czech piano manufacturer Petrof, founded by Anton√≠n Petrof in the town of Hradec Kr√°lov√©, acquired the license for the production of the instrument in 1932. These were named and marketed in similar manner to the C. Bechstein, as the neo-Petrof. Estimates of the number of Neo-Bechstein pianos produced differ widely, from 150 to 15‚Äì20. Nernst sought a single cash payment for his design but instead received a royalty-fee offer from Siemens and Bechstein. Two functioning copies exist, one of which is displayed in the Vienna Technical Museum.

These included the 10th Street galleries, such as the March Gallery (of which he was an original member), the Brata Gallery, and the Tanger Gallery. He also showcased his work at the Gallery Gertrude Stein and the Block Museum of Art in Chicago. In the 1960s, Armento performed sculpture work in Paris with Al Held. In 2001, his artworks were featured in the NO!art and the Aesthetics of Doom exhibition. Armento was skilled in a wide variety of sculptural techniques. These included casting in sand; the Shaw process; lost wax processing; latex, Roman, and piece molds, and model creation for industrial casting. Legacy Select pieces of Armento's work are part of the permanent NO!Art collection. Photographs of his sculpture have been preserved by the Smithsonian and his contributions to American Art recorded in the Thomas Hess Papers. Many of his paintings and sculptures have been preserved and cataloged by his estate, providing more examples of his artistic style. Armento died in 2011 of congestive heart failure. He has two sons, Ben and Dante Armento.

Life Pauline Clotworthy was born Pauline Cecily Elizabeth Keohler in Dublin on 17 May 1912. Her father was Robert Nesbitt Keohler, a solicitor, and his second wife, Ethel (n√©e Thompson). Robert's first wife was Ethel's elder sister, Edith Thompson, who had died after the birth of her daughter in 1902. Robert Keohler changed his name to Keller by deed poll two months after the outbreak of World War I, in October 1914. Clotworthy was educated at Alexandra College, and then went on to attend the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin from 1931 to 1932. One of her lecturers, Se√°n Keating, unsuccessfully attempted to stop her from creating fashion sketches during his life drawing classes. Following her interest in fashion, Clotworthy moved to London to attend Browns Paris School of Fashion on Bond Street. Taking advice from the advertising manager of Arnotts in Dublin, Ronald Nesbitt, she returned to London to enrol in the British Institute of Dress Designers. There she learnt pattern-making, cutting, and garment construction alongside fellow students such as Hardy Amies. She completed the course in May 1938. She noticed that there was no equivalent training school in Ireland, and with the help of her father, she went about establishing The Grafton Academy of Dress Designing and Millinery at 6 St Stephens Green. Her first 15 students begun their training in 1938, and within a few years the annual student show became a feature of the Dublin society calendar. Many prominent designers taught at the school, including Neill√≠ Mulcahy, whilst others were pupils such as Ib Jorgensen. As the only such fashion design training in Ireland for a number of years, Clotworthy was described at the academy's 70th anniversary as the \\"backbone of the Irish clothing trade\\". She married Neil Desmond Clotworthy (1917‚Äì1992) in 1940. He was an officer in Irish army, who was born in Saskatchewan, Canada to Irish parents. The couple had two daughters and one son. Clotworthy died on 22 December 2004 at the Blackrock Clinic. She is buried at the Friends' burial ground, Blackrock.

Thisbe is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad by Homer, who says that it abounds in wild pigeons - œÄŒøŒªœÖœÑœÅŒÆœÑœÅœâŒΩŒ¨ œÑŒµ ŒòŒØœÉŒ≤Œ∑ŒΩ; and both Strabo and Stephanus of Byzantium remark that this epithet was given to the city from the abundance of wild pigeons at the harbour of Thisbe. Xenophon remarks that Cleombrotus I marched through the territory of Thisbe on his way to Creusis before the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE. The only public building at Thisbe mentioned by Pausanias was a temple of Heracles, to whom a festival was celebrated. The same writer adds that between the mountain on the sea-side and the mountain at the foot of which the town stood, there is a plain which would be inundated by the water flowing into it, were it not for a mole or causeway constructed through the middle, by means of which the water is diverted every year into the part of the plain lying on one side of the causeway, while that on the other is cultivated. The ruins of Thisbe are found near modern Kakosi. William Martin Leake visited the site in the 19th century and wrote: \\"The position is between two great summits of the mountain, now called Karam√∫nghi and Paleovun√°, which rise majestically above the vale, clothed with trees, in the upper part, and covered with snow at the top. The modern village lies in a little hollow surrounded on all sides by low cliffs connected with the last falls of the mountain. The walls of Thisbe were about a mile [1.6 km] in circuit, following the crest of the cliffs which surround the village; they are chiefly preserved on the side towards Dobren√° and the south-east. The masonry is for the most part of the fourth order, or faced with equal layers of large, oblong, quadrangular stones on the outside, the interior as usual being filled with loose rubble. On the principal height which lies towards the mountain, and which is an entire mass of rock, appear some reparations of a later date than the rest of the walls, and there are many Hellenic foundations on the face of this rock towards the village. In the cliffs outside the walls, to the northwest and south, there are many sepulchral excavations.\\"William Martin Leake, Travels in Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 506. Leake observed the mole or causeway which Pausanias describes, and which serves for a road across the marsh to the port. The same writer remarks that, as the plain of Thisbe is completely surrounded by heights, there is no issue for the river which rises in the Ascraea and here terminates. \\"The river crosses the causeway into the marsh by two openings, the closing of which in the winter or spring would at any time cause the upper part of the plain to be inundated, and leave the lower fit for cultivation in the summer; but as the river is now allowed to flow constantly through them, the western side is always in a state of marsh, and the ground has become much higher on the eastern side.\\" The port of Thisbe is now called Vath√Ω. The shore is very rocky, and abounds in wild pigeons, as Strabo and Stephanus have observed; but there is also a considerable number at Kakosi itself. The Roman poets also allude to the pigeons of Thisbe. Hence Ovid speaks of the \\"Thisbaeae columbae,\\"Ovid, Metamorphoses, 11.300 and Statius describes Thisbe as \\"Dionaeis avibus circumsona.\\"Statius, Thebaid, 7.261 Thisbe is mentioned both by Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy.

The array is designed to measure red-shifted 21-cm hydrogen line emission on large angular scales, in order to map out the baryon acoustic oscillations, and constrain models of dark energy and dark matter. The HIRAX collaboration is made up of over a dozen institutions, mainly from South Africa, the United States, and Canada, including the University of KwaZulu-Natal, the Durban University of Technology, the University of the Western Cape, Rhodes University, the University of Cape Town, McGill University, the University of Toronto, the University of British Columbia, Yale University, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon, the University of Wisconsin, the West Virginia University, Oxford University, the Astroparticle and Cosmology Laboratory, the ETH Zurich, the Academia Sinica, Hangzhou Dianzi University, the NRAO, and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is funded by the National Research Foundation of South Africa, and by the partner institutions. The HIRAX array is named in reference to the hyrax, a local mammal, and in parallel to the neighboring meerKAT radio telescope and its eponymous animal.  Science goals  The nature of the dark energy and dark matter are among the greatest unsolved mysteries in modern cosmology. It has been known since the late 1920s, with the discovery of Hubble's law, that the universe is expanding, but for most of the 20th century it was assumed that this was a decelerating expansion, following a hot Big Bang. However, in the late 1990s it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is in fact accelerating. Dark energy is the hypothesized form of energy which causes this acceleration, however little is known about it beyond the fact that it must currently comprise approximately 70% of the energy density of the universe. Dark matter also plays a significant role in the growth of structures within the universe. It is believed to be a form of matter that interacts with the gravitational force, but not the electromagnetic force, and it is known to make up approximately 25% of the energy density of the universe, but the exact nature of it is not understood. The remaining 5% of the energy density of the universe is the baryonic matter which we can see; the stars, gas and dust that makes up galaxies and galaxy clusters. HIRAX is designed to measure the effects of dark energy and dark matter on the dynamics of universe over a long period of time (~4 billion years) to learn more about their nature. This is accomplished by looking at the 21-cm line emission produced by hot diffuse neutral hydrogen from distant galaxy clusters and from the intracluster medium. This neutral hydrogen traces out the large scale structures in the universe, and so can be used to map out the large scale Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) structure of the universe. The BAO are a fixed comoving size, and so they act as a standard ruler, marking the expansion of the universe over time, and therefore giving information about dark energy and dark matter. For example, if dark energy is not a cosmological constant, as the standard ŒõCDM theory of cosmology predicts, then the rate of acceleration of the universe may not be constant over time. Due to the expansion of the universe, the 400-800 MHz operating band of the HIRAX instrument corresponds to redshifted 21-cm emission from 0.8 < z < 2.5 (7-11Bya, or when the universe was between 2.5 and 6.5 billion years old). This range encompasses the period when the standard ŒõCDM cosmological model predicts that dark energy is beginning to affect the dynamics of the universe, causing it to transition from decelerating expansion to accelerating expansion. The HIRAX array will survey most of the southern sky to map out BAO, and its large field of view and large survey area will additionally make it a very powerful tool for detecting radio transient events. In particular, HIRAX will be extremely efficient at detecting Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and Pulsars. FRBs are short (~1 ms) bright (~1 Jy) radio bursts, whose origins are completely unknown. Only approximately 20 have been detected as of 2018, but the HIRAX array expects to detect tens of FRBs per day. Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars, whose rotation causes them to appear to emit radio frequency pulses at very regular rates. Precise measurements of the rates of their pulses could be used to detect gravitational waves, because the gravitational waves would distort the size of the space the pulses travel through, and thus their arrival times at Earth. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a sister experiment to HIRAX. It has similar science objectives, but observes in the northern hemisphere, and has different instrumental systematics.  Instrument  The HIRAX array will consist of 1024 6-meter diameter parabolic dish reflectors with a field of view of 5‚Äì10¬∞. The dishes will not be steered, but fixed in position and sweep the sky as the Earth rotates. Every few months, they will be manually re-pointed in elevation to survey a new strip of the sky. The dishes are extremely deep, with an f-number of 0.25, to shield the feeds from ground pickup, and crosstalk from neighboring dishes in the array. The antennas have been optimized to have low loss and high reflectivity across the 400‚Äì800 MHz observing band of the telescope. Each dish is coupled to a single dual-polarization clover-leaf dipole antenna. The signal is amplified by a pair of low noise amplifiers (LNAs), and transmitted to a centralized computation structure (the \\"back end\\") by means of fibre-optic links. At the back end the signal is amplified further by analog amplifier chains, then digitized and correlated with the signals from all other dishes to produce a single coherent image from the whole array. The digitization and frequency channelization operations will be performed by custom field programmable gate array (FPGA) boards, and the correlation will be run on a custom graphics processing unit (GPU) based high performance computing cluster. This correlation operation is extremely computationally expensive, and is the primary reason why such large interferometric arrays have not previously been fielded. In full array operation, HIRAX will be required to process 6.5 Tb of data per second, which is comparable to the total international internet bandwidth for the continent of Africa. This problem is made feasible by recent advances in GPU based computing, and by the regular spacing between the array elements, which lowers the computational difficulty from O(n^2) to O(n \\\\log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.  Status  The HIRAX prototype telescope array at HartRAO in 2017. The HIRAX collaboration fielded an 8-element prototype array at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) in 2017, which is used as a test bed for hardware and software development leading up to the construction of the full array at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) site in the Karoo. Construction of a 128-element pathfinder array is slated to begin in 2019. The pathfinder array will then be expanded out to the full 1024-element array over the course of the following three years. The HartRAO 8-element array will be incorporated into the full array as an \\"outrigger\\" array, along with several others throughout southern Africa. These outriggers will dramatically improve the angular resolution of the HIRAX array, allowing it to localize FRB detections with sub-arcsecond precision. The University of KwaZulu-Natal, and the South African Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation announced the official launch of the HIRAX experiment in August 2018.

Mount Erciyes south of Kayseri, Mount Hasan southeast of Aksaray, Mount Melendiz in Niƒüde, and some smaller volcanoes covered the region of Cappadocia with a layer of tuff stone over the course of a twenty million year period ending in prehistoric times, after which erosion created the well-known rock formations of the region.Wolfgang Dorn: T√ºrkei ‚Äì Zentralanatolien: zwischen Phrygien, Ankara und Kappadokien.

Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft Darmstadt 2002, p. 50 Since this soft stone is comparatively easy to work, people were probably carving it into dugouts by the early Bronze Age. In the course of time, this progressed to living complexes, monasteries, and whole underground cities. Since 1985, the 'rock sites of Cappadocia' have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Entry in the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. History  Prehistory and antiquity  From traces of settlement it is known that the region of Cappadocia was inhabited in prehistoric times. Whether rock-cuttings had already been made at that time is not clear. It is probable however that in the Bronze Age at the latest, when the region was in the middle of the Hittite empire, the first passageways and rooms had been cut into the rock, as well as reservoirs and possibly even refuges in the cliffs.SpiegelOnline In Derinkuyu underground city, only one tool of Hittite origin has been found and it might have been brought there at a later date.Elford/Graf: Reise in die Vergangenheit (Kappadokien). AND Verlag Istanbul, 1976 The earliest attestation of these structures is in Xenophon's Anabasis, which mentions people in Anatolia who had built their houses underground.Peter Daners, Volher Ohl: Kappadokien. Dumont 1996 Wolfgang Dorn. T√ºrkei ‚Äì Zentralanatolien: zwischen Phrygien, Ankara und Kappadokien. DuMont, 2006, , p. 283 (Google Books)  Christian settlement  Karanlƒ±k Kilise in G√∂reme The initial Christian settlement of the region came in the first centuries AD, starting with hermits who retreated into the seclusion of the tuff landscape from the Christian community at Caesarea. They either settled in caves that already existed or dug their own residences in the cliffs. Since they were seeking solitude rather than protection from enemies, they largely made their homes above ground level. After the Christian church was re-organised under the Cappadocian Fathers (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus) in the fourth century AD, ever larger groups of Christians followed them over the next few centuries, settling in Cappadocia and building cloistered communities, which meant that they needed ever more and ever larger residential and religious spaces. Meanwhile, in the fourth century, the Isaurians invaded, in the fifth century the Huns, and finally in the sixth century the Sassanid Persians; in 605 the city of Caesarea was conquered during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628. These incursions sparked the intensive construction of rock-cut buildings below and above ground, including whole cities. The design of these structures was principally shaped by security and defensive concerns. From 642, the Arabs began to invade the region and these concerns grew increasingly significant, with the result that Christian communities continued to live in the region for three centuries, secure from raids. Eventually, the Byzantines regained control over Cappadocia and under their rule Christianity and Christian architecture in Cappadocia entered a golden age.Katpatuka.org Settlement history By the eleventh century, roughly three thousand churches had been carved in the rocks. In the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan defeated the Byzantine Emperor Romanos IV, marking the end of Byzantine rule in Anatolia and the beginning of Turkish pre-eminence in the region. Despite the religious tolerance of the Seljuks, this marked the beginning of the decline of Christianity in Cappadocia and the long decline of church architecture. As a result of the gradual emigration of the Christian inhabitants, the existing cloisters were slowly taken over by Turkish farmers, who renovated them according to their own needs. Since camouflage and defence were no longer necessary, facades and houses were built in front of entranceways that had formerly been hidden and inconspicuous. The rock-cut houses continued to be used by the Turkish inhabitants in the twentieth century ‚Äì partially because of the continuously pleasant temperatures under the rock. In 1832, the population had to make use of the underground cities for safety against Egyptian armies during the First Egyptian-Ottoman War. The last remaining Christians left the area in 1923 as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The final Turkish inhabitants moved out of the cave settlement at Zelve in the 1950s after earthquakes had done significant damage and made the structures increasingly dangerous. Even today, however, some caves in U√ßhisar, Ortahisar, and the Soƒüanlƒ± valley are still used, at least during the hot summer months, usually with a house attached to them.  Underground cities  Underground toilet in The underground cities were well designed for protection against attacks. The few entrances were hidden by foliage and not easily spotted from outside. Inside, they took the form of a labyrinth of passageways which were unnavigable for outsiders, and could be sealed with large rock doors, around a metre high and shaped like mill-stones. These doors were built such that they could be rolled into a closed position relatively easily, but could not be moved from the outside. They had a hole in the centre which was probably used as a kind of peephole. In some cities there were holes in ceiling above, through which the enemy could be attacked with spears. The cities descended up to twelve stories ‚Äì over 100 metres ‚Äì under the ground and had everything necessary for a long siege. The upper stories were largely used as stables and storerooms, with a constant temperature of around 10 ¬∞C. In the walls of the caverns there were receptacles for various kinds of food, as well as hollows for vessels in which liquids could be stored. Further down, were the living and working spaces, where furniture, including seats, tables, and beds were carved out of the rock. Working spaces include a wine press at Derinkuyu, a copper foundry in Kaymakli, as well as cisterns and wells which ensured a supply of drinking water during a long siege.Michael Bussmann/Gabriele Tr√∂ger: T√ºrkei. Michael M√ºller Verlag 2004 There were also prisons and toilets. Door stone in Derinkuyu On the deeper floors there were also monastery cells and churches. The churches in the underground cities are very simple and seldom or never decorated. There are no wall paintings like those found in the later, larger churches like G√∂reme. Most of them have a cross-shaped ground plan, often with one or two apses. In the rooms near the churches, tombs were cut in the walls. In order to supply the people within with fresh air for breathing, heating, and lighting for a siege of up to six months, there was a complex system of ventilation shafts, which still function today. These also served as the outlet for the smoke from cooking fires in the kitchens. Nearly forty underground cities are known in Cappadocia, only a small proportion of which are accessible to the public. Further, undiscovered cities may exist. The cities may have originally been linked to one another by kilometre-long passageways, but no such passages have yet been found. Estimates of the number of people in these cities diverge starkly and range between 3,000 and 30,000. The largest is probably the largely unexplored city of √ñzkonak, located about ten kilometres northwest of Avanos, with perhaps nineteen levels and 60,000 inhabitants, but the best known and most frequented by tourists are Derinkuyu and Kaymakli.  Castles and cliff cities  Rock castle of Ortahisar Recessed hand-holds of a ladder in Zelve In contrast to the underground cities, are the so-called castles or castle-mountains, like U√ßhisar or Ortahisar. These are rock outcrops, which are also crisscrossed by a tangle of passageways and rooms. As a result of erosion and earthquake damage, parts of these are often now open to the air. The castles also served as refuges from danger and could be sealed with door-stones similar to those in the underground cities. They could accommodate around 1,000 people. The ground-level caverns have been partially integrated into the houses built in front of them and continue to be used as stables and storerooms to this day. Caverns at Zelve In addition, there are also a series of places, which consist of collections of residences and other rooms carved into cliff faces. The largest of these is Zelve and the best-known is G√∂reme, but whole cities of these cliff buildings can also be seen at Soƒüanlƒ± valley, G√ºl≈üehir, and G√ºzelyurt. At these sites, underground cities are mixed with residential complexes, cloisters, work spaces of other sorts and churches in the steep cliffs. In these cases too, a large portion of the rooms are connected by a branched tunnel system. The entrances are usually open, since the main point was not really to be hidden, like the underground cities. Nevertheless, entry is sometimes made very difficult by the fact that the vertical cliff-faces had to be clambered up using simple hand and footholds. Inside the internal tunnel system, too, moving around is made difficult by steep, narrow passageways and vertical chimneys. In many of these places, dovecotes are carved in the high cliff walls, often with colourfully painted entrance holes. The colour would attract the birds, which then made their nests in them. These dovecotes were accessed once a year by difficult climbing manoeuvres and the birds' excrement was then collected for use as fertiliser.Wolfgang Dorn. T√ºrkei ‚Äì Zentralanatolien: zwischen Phrygien, Ankara und Kappadokien. DuMont, 2006, , p. 349 bei GoogleBooks Pre-existing holes were also converted into dovecotes by cutting niches for nests and walling up entrances.  Churches  A church ceiling damaged by an earthquake in Zelve The numberless churches in Cappadocia range from single completely undecorated rooms in the underground cities which can only be identified as religious spaces by the presence of an altar stone, through cross-in-square churches, to the three-aisle basilica. They are all strongly shaped by Byzantine church architecture. Most have a cross-shaped groundplan, one or more cupolas, barrel vaults or combinations of all these elements. The key difference from built church architecture is the fact that the builders were not constructing a structure and had no need to plan supporting walls and columns since they only had to carve out the rooms from the existing rock. Nevertheless, they incorporated elements from traditional architecture, like columns and pilasters, although they did not actually serve any load-bearing function. The furniture of the churches, like the altars, pews, baptismal fonts, choir seating, and choir screen were also carved out of the rock in most cases. On the outside, the churches are often visible from far away as a result of facades with blind arcades, gables, and columns. Thedesign of the paintings allows the date of a church's creation to be determined to some degree. While the simple chapels in the underground cities are unpainted, the earliest churches above ground level have simple figural frescoes. One example is the Aƒüa√ßaltƒ± KilesesiAgacalti Church in the Ihlara valley, which was probably built in the seventh century. Later churches are decorated only with plain geometric decorations like crosses, zigzag lines, daimonds, and rosettes, which are drawn on the rock walls with red paint. These date from the eighth and early ninth centuries, the period of the Byzantine Iconoclasm. Possibly under Arab-Islamic influence all depictions of Jesus, the apostles, and the saints were forbidden by Leo III as being impious. In the two-story Church of Saint John in G√ºl≈üehir, iconoclastic patters can still be seen on the lower level. In the ninth century, the iconoclasm was ended and, from then on, the churches were decorated with ever more complex frescoes. As part of this, the older churches were largely repainted, so relatively few of the old paintings survive. In many un-restored churches, the old geometric patterns can be seen where the more recent plaster is peeling away. Ever more detailed paintings were accomplished in this period, which allows age to be estimated. It is clear that there were template collections for the artists, with the help of which the outlines of the paintings were sketched out and then finally painted. Among the most common paintings were scenes from the life of Jesus, like his nativity, baptism by John the Baptist, miracles, last supper, crucifixion, entombment, and resurrection. Many of the frescoes have been heavily damaged by thrown stones, especially the figure's eyes. These are the result of the later Islamic aniconism. Since the 1980s, many churches have been carefully restored.

In the 13th century, the Byzantine author Theodore Skoutariotes mentions the convenient temperatures of the tuff caverns, which were relatively warm through the cold Anatolian winters and pleasantly cool in the hot summer months. In 1906, the German scholar visited Cappadocia and wrote about it in his book Kleinasiatische Denkm√§ler.Robert G. Ousterhout: A Byzantine Settlement in Cappadocia.Dumbarton Oaks, 2005, p. 2 , on Google Books Suchbuch.de In the same period, Guillaume de Jerphanion went to the region and wrote the first academic work on the rock-cut churches and their paintings. A systematic investigation of the structures was first undertaken in the 1960s, when the last inhabitants had vacated the rock-cut dwellings. Marcell Restle conducted research on site in the 1960s and published extensive studies on the architecture of the churches built from stone and the paintings of the rock-cut churches. Lyn Rodley investigated the monastery complexes in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the German ethnologist Andus Emge worked on the development of the traditional residential structures in the Cappadocian town of G√∂reme.

The navigation from Peloponnesus to Creusis is described by Pausanias as insecure, on account of the many headlands which it was necessary to double, and of the violent gusts of wind rushing down from the mountains. Creusis was on the borders of Megaris. One of the highest points of Mount Cithaeron projects into the sea between Creusis and Aegosthena, the frontier town in Megaris, leaving no passage along the shore except a narrow path on the side of the mountain. In confirmation of Pausanias, William Martin Leake, who visited the site in the 19th century, remarks that this termination of Mt. Cithaeron, as well as all the adjoining part of the Alcyonic Sea, is subject to sudden gusts of wind, by which the passage of such a cornice is sometimes rendered dangerous. On two occasions the Lacedaemonians retreated from Boeotia by this route, in order to avoid the more direct roads across Mt. Cithaeron. On the first of these occasions, in 378 BCE, the Lacedaemonian army under Cleombrotus I was overtaken by such a violent storm that the shields of the soldiers were wrested from their hands by the wind, and many of the beasts of burden were blown over the precipices. The second time that they took this route was after the fatal Battle of Leuctra, in 371 BCE. Its site is located near modern Livadostro.

This ferry connects Sakhalin Island with mainland Russia and its distance is 260 km. It is operated by Sakhalin Shipping Company.  History  From 1950 to 1953, the construction of the Sakhalin Tunnel was underway. However these works were suspended after the death of Stalin. In April 1962, a regional meeting on the development of Russian Far East was held in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, this suggestion was raised again. On September 3, 1964, ‚ÄúOn Measures to Accelerate the Development of the Sakhalin Oblast Productive Forces‚Äù was adopted by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and it included the idea of Vanino-Kholmsk train ferry. On April 12, 1973, the Sakhalin-1 icebreaking ferry, coming its course from the Baltic, under the command of Captain V. S. Bylkova, dropped off at the Kholmsk port. On June 27, 1973, the Vanino-Kholmsk train ferry service was solemnly opened. With the commissioning of this ferry, a qualitatively new stage in the development of transport and economic relations of the Sakhalin and the entire Russian Far Eastern region began. The transportation amount was increased, so 6 million tons of cargo and over 300 thousand passengers were transported. In the most intense for the crossing of the 1970s and 1980s, up to 8 ferries simultaneously operated on the line. The general crisis of the economy in 1990s also affected the ferry. Cargo was delayed due to non-payment for transportation. Ferries sometimes for several days did not leave the ports.  Recently  Vanino-Kholmsk train ferry is carried out by specialized ferry vessels designed and built specifically for work on this line. A total of 10 vessels of the Sakhalin series were built in the USSR at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad–ò–°–¢–û–†–ò–Ø. The first five vessels no longer exist, Sakhalin-6 was sold to the Moscow Government to work in the Kerch Strait ferry line and later also disposed–°–∞—Ö–∞–ª–∏–Ω-6. At the beginning of the 2010s, the ferry fleet owned by Sakhalin Shipping Company (SASCO), consists of four similar diesel-electric ships: Sakhalin-7, Sakhalin-8, Sakhalin-9 And Sakhalin-10. Each of them is designed to carry 28 railway wagons or 37 heavy trucks in one trip. In addition, each ferry (except for the Sakhalin-10 ferry equipped for the transport of dangerous goods) takes on up to one hundred passengers. Passenger transportation is carried out by ferry \\"Sakhalin-8\\" and \\"Sakhalin-9\\". A typical ferry time on the line is 11‚Äì12 hours, in winter and in bad weather, 16‚Äì18 hours, occasionally up to 21 hours. Ferries transport directly those rail cars in which the cargo follows the network of Russian railways. This technology, which excludes physical transshipment of cargo in ports, makes it possible to reduce the time and volume of cargo operations of ports, reduce the time of transportation, increase the safety of cargo. Since the Sakhalin railway gauge (1067 mm) differs from the national one, bogie exchange is performed in the port of Kholmsk. At the same time, unlike some foreign rail ferries, the carriage of passenger cars at the Sakhalin ferry is not provided; passengers are transported in the passenger cabins of the ferry. Since the end of the 90s, with the opening of a car service from Vanino to Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-on-Amur, SASCO transports not only rail cars, but also motor vehicles, especially heavy vehicles with perishable goods and other consumer goods. in loads. The ferry Vanino - Kholmsk and today continues to be the most important transport artery between Sakhalin and the mainland of Russia. Its capacity is 3.3 million tons of cargo per year. In 2009, 1.4 million tons of cargo were transported through it. The ferry provides year-round delivery of necessary goods for the Sakhalin Region and passengers. In the opposite direction, products from the fish, pulp and paper industry, etc. are delivered from the island to the mainland. Through the ferry, foreign trade cargoes are brought to the mainland, delivered by maritime merchant ships from Southeast Asia and others to the Sakhalin ports of Korsakov and Kholmsk. In connection with the aging of ferry ships (the youngest ferry Sakhalin-10 was built in 1992, the others are even older) and the timing of their cancellation was approached by the Sakhalin Shipping Company, the feasibility study of the ferry complex was completed, including the construction of second-generation ferries with a capacity of 38 wagons option. There are no fixed timetables for ferries on the line, they are sent ‚Äúby filling‚Äù, the time of departure and the approach of ships varies depending on the availability of cargo and weather conditions.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999Tennessee's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1996 High grassy ridges offer views of mountain ranges to the north and south; balds on Rogers Ridge are among the most extensive in the Southern Appalachians; and Gentry Creek has 30-foot waterfalls that cascade over high rock walls to clear pools below. With few midstory trees, tall trees with lush ground vegetation combine to give the hiker an experience of a mystical, openwoods atmosphere. The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia and Eastern Tennessee, about 2 miles east of Laurel Bloomery, Tennessee and 4 miles southwest of Konnarock, Virginia. It is bounded by Gentry Creek Rd. (Forest Road 123) on the south, private lands to the west and east, and Va 726 on the north. Trails into the area include: *Gentry Creek Falls Trail, FS 51, 2.6 miles *Rogers Ridge Horse Trail, FS 192, 5.8 miles Road access into the area is provided by Va 124. Boundary of the Rogers Ridge wildarea as identified by the Wilderness Society.The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 783 (Mount Rogers). and Map 783 (South Holston and Watauga Lakes) A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Rogers Ridge wildarea is covered by USGS topographic map Grayson. Natural history A variety of wildflowers include the rare Silverling, Robbins ragwort, Rock skullcap, Roan rattlesnake root, Fraser's sedge, Mountain bitter cress, Appalchian twayblade, Rosy twisted stalk and Minnie bush. The site contains mountain bogs and two stands of old growth forests. The last authenticated siting of an eastern cougar occurred here. The section of the area in the Cherokee National Forest has five streams with trout populations; Gentry Creek has rainbow trout and brook trout; Grindstone Branch has rainbow and brook; Cut Laurel Branch, rainbow and brook; Kate Branch, rainbow and brook; Richardson Branch, brook trout; and Whetstone Branch with brook trout. Brook trout is considered a native species. Valley Creek in the Virginia part of the area is recognized by Virginia for its water quality. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column.: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: April 23, 2018 Valley Creek is a class iii trout stream. Topography With elevations ranging from 2600 feet in the lower drainages to 4880 feet, Rogers Ridge is a mountain ridge divided by small steep sideslope drainages. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Rogers Ridge was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. The area within the Jefferson National Forest has a ‚ÄúScenic Area‚Äù prescription. The center of the area in the Cherokee National Forest has 3865 acres designated as the Rogers Ridge Scenic Area. The remaining area is designated Remote Back-country-Few Roads.

History The first Bradford Trades Council was founded in July 1867 by six local unions. They were inspired by the London tailors' strike, but feared that it would result in a ban on trade unions. It was led by president William Angus, secretary C. D. Dewhurst, and treasurer Robert Bayes. It sent questions to the candidates in the Bradford by-election, 1867, but ultimately decided against backing either candidate. Dewhurst represented the council at the first Trades Union Congress, but he read a paper which had not been approved by the trades council. It was also found that his union had not paid its affiliation fees, so he was replaced as secretary. He had returned to the post by 1869, but the council ceased operating soon afterwards. A new Bradford Trades Council was founded on 16 July 1872 at the Black Bull. It was led by president Samuel Shaftoe, vice president Robert Scott, treasurer W. Scruton, and secretary Edward Riley. In its early years, it focused on campaigning for a nine-hour maximum working day, and on providing support for unions which were in dispute. From the 1880s, the council worked closely with what became the Amalgamated Society of Dyers; one of its leading figures, William Otty, became president of the trades council in 1882, and from 1897, the council was based at the trades hall which was owned by the union. The Manningham Mills strike of 1890-1891 moved many leading figures on the council away from the Liberal Party. James Bartley, William Henry Drew and Joseph Hayhurst founded the Bradford Labour Union in 1891. The trades council sponsored a joint slate with the Labour Union in the municipal elections, putting up Bartley, Edwin Halford, Andrew Hopkinson, and Shaftoe, on a platform of an eight-hour day for municipal workers, and municipal contracts to employ trade union members. The council also sponsored Ben Tillett's unsuccessful candidacy in Bradford West in the 1892 UK general election. The Labour Union became part of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and from 1902, the trades council began working with the ILP and local trade unions in the Workers' Municipal Federation (WMF). The trades council became known as the Bradford Trades and Labour Council, and was the central body for the local Labour Party, but only stood candidates in agreement with the ILP and Social Democratic Federation. From 1914 to 1936, the WMF published the Bradford Pioneer.Newspapers in Special Collections, University of Bradford The first woman to become a delegate to the trades council was Julia Varley, in 1899; five years later, she was the first woman to become a member of its executive. The trades council opposed World War I, prompting some local Labour councillors to ask it to drop \\"Labour\\" from its name. This was rejected, and the council continued on a radical course, supporting the Hands Off Russia campaign, and organising the 1926 UK general strike in the city. It has remained active ever since, and in recent years has been known as the Bradford Trades Union Council.

Nivine El-Qabbage is its current minister after the previous minister Ghada Waly. Its vision is to reduce the number of poor in the country by providing support and social safety nets. Duties NGOs and charities work hand in hand with the Ministry and do a large part of the social safety net work, however, after the June 2013 Egyptian protests and when Abdel Fattah el-Sisi became president, he stated NGOs had to be carefully vetted for national security reasons. Egypt was widely criticized for this. In August 2013, the ministry began disbanding The Muslim Brotherhood. In 2014, the ministry reported there were 600 NGOs operating in Egypt. The ministry required NGOs to show transparency and reveal where their funding came from. In 2016, the NGOs Act was passed and the ministry sent letters to NGOs requiring them to disclose activities a month and a half prior to said activities. The NGOs Act passed in 2016 allowed the Ministry of Social Solidarity to disband NGOs but in June 2018, the Egyptian Supreme Constitutional Court stated that clause in the Act was unconstitutional and that the ministry did not have the right to disband NGOs.  Initiatives  The ministry has developed a welfare system, to provide cash and support services to people in need, such as to orphans under 18, children of single mothers, previously imprisoned people, disabled citizens, elderly over 65, divorced women and widows. In 2015, the ministry began its You Are Stronger Than Drugs campaign featuring football star Mohamed Salah. Again in 2018, the ministry in conjunction with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, launched an anti-addiction advertising campaign featuring Mohamed Salah, to encourage its young citizens to avoid illegal drug use.

Following the strike, many local trade unionists believed that they needed an independent organisation which would nominate trade unionists for political posts who would not be affiliated with the Liberal Party or the Conservative Party. The Labour Union was founded in 1891 by a group of trade unionists, including James Bartley, Charlie Glyde, Edward Hartley, William Henry Drew and Joseph Hayhurst. They agreed to run a joint slate in the municipal elections with the Bradford Trades Council, and they put up Bartley, Edwin Halford, Andrew Hopkinson, and Samuel Shaftoe, on a platform of an eight-hour day for municipal workers, and for municipal contracts to employ trade union members. Only Shaftoe won a seat, and he worked closely with the Liberal Party, but in 1892 the socialist Fred Jowett was elected, as was Leonard Robinson.Fenner Brockway, Socialism Over Sixty Years: The Life of Jowett of Bradford.

The resolution was taken in response to a decision of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople of 11 October 2018, confirming its intentions to grant autocephaly (independence) to the Eastern Orthodox church in Ukraine in the future. The decision also stated that the Holy Synod would immediately: reestablish a stauropegion in Kyiv, i.e. a church body subordinated directly to the Ecumenical Patriarch; revoke the \\"Letter of issue\\" (permission) of 1686 that had given permission to the Patriarch of Moscow to ordain the Metropolitan of Kyiv; and lift the excommunications which affected the clergy and faithfuls of two unrecognized Ukrainian Eastern Orthodox churches. Those two unrecognized churches, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP), were competing with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (UOC-MP) and were considered \\"schismatics\\" (illegally segregated groups) by the Patriarchate of Moscow, as well as by the other Eastern Orthodox churches. In its decision of 15 October 2018, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church barred all members of the Moscow Patriarchate (both clergy and laity) from taking part in communion, baptism, and marriage at any church controlled by the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Before that, in response to the appointment of two exarchs of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Ukraine, the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate had decided, on 14 September 2018, to break off participation in any episcopal assemblies, theological discussions, multilateral commissions, and any other structures that are chaired or co-chaired by representatives of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The schism forms part of a wider political conflict involving Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimea and its military intervention in Ukraine, as well as Ukraine's desire to join the European Union and NATO. This schism is reminiscent of the Moscow‚ÄìConstantinople schism of 1996 over canonical jurisdiction over Estonia, which was however resolved after less than three months. On 21 October 2019, Archbishop Ieronymos II of Athens, the primate of the Church of Greece, sent a peaceful letter to Epiphanius, the primate of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU, that was formed by the unification of the UOC-KP, UAOC, and parts of the UOC-MP on 15 December 2018). This decision was supported by the whole hierarchy (bishops) of the Church of Greece, minus 7 Metropolitans. This decision meant that the Church of Greece recognized the OCU. The ROC had announced previously it would break communion with any hierarch of the Church of Greece who enters in communion with any hierarch of the OCU. On Sunday, 3 November 2019, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow did not mention the primate of the Church of Greece in the liturgy, removing him from the diptych. On 26 December, the ROC broke eucharistic communion with the Patriarch of Alexandria and ceased commemorating him, because he had recognized the OCU the month before. Background  History of Eastern Orthodoxy in Ukraine  center After the baptism of Rus' these lands were under the control of the Metropolitan of Kyiv. Among the 24 metropolitans who held the throne before the Mongol invasion, only two were of local origin and the rest were Greek. Usually, they were appointed by Constantinople and were not chosen by the bishops of their dioceses, as it should be done according to the canon. After the Mongol invasion, the southern part of Rus' was heavily devastated and the disintegration of Kyivan Rus' accelerated. Metropolitan Kirill III, who occupied the throne for 30 years, spent almost all of his time in the lands of Vladimir-Suzdal Rus' and visited Kyiv only twice, although earlier he had come from Galicia and had been nominated for the post of Metropolitan by the prince Daniel of Galicia. After the new Mongol raid in 1299, Metropolitan Maksim finally moved to Vladimir in the north, and did not even leave a bishop behind. In 1303 a new cathedra was created for south-west Rus' in Galicia and the new Metropolitan was consecrated by Constantinople, but its existence ended in 1355 after the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars. In 1325, Metropolitan Peter moved to Moscow, thus greatly contributing to the rise of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which gradually conquered other Russian principalities in the northeast of the former Kyivan Rus'. Another part of Kyivan Rus' gradually came under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, which entered into rivalry with Moscow. In particular, the Grand Dukes of Lithuania sought from Constantinople a separate Metropolitan for the Orthodox who lived in their lands. Although the Metropolitan in Moscow continued to retain the title of \\"Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Rus, he could not rule the Orthodox outside the borders of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Constantinople twice agreed to create a separate Metropolitan for Lithuania, but these decisions were not permanent, Constantinople being inclined to maintain a single church government on the lands of the former Kyivan Rus'. In 1439, Constantinople entered into union with the Roman Catholic Church. In Moscow, this decision was rejected outright, and Metropolitan Isidor, consecrated by Constantinople, was accused in heresy, imprisoned, and later expelled. In 1448, the council of north-eastern Russian clergy in Moscow, at the behest of prince Vasily II of Moscow, elected Jonah the Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Rus' without the consent of the Patriarch of Constantinople. In 1469 Patriarch Dionysius I stated that Constantinople would not recognize any metropolitan ordained without its blessing. Meanwhile, the metropolis of Kyiv (de facto in Novogrudok) stayed under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Moscow's de facto independence from Constantinople remained unrecognized until 1589 when Patriarch of Constantinople Jeremiah II approved the creation of a new, fifth Orthodox Patriarchate in Moscow. This decision was finally confirmed by the four older Patriarchs in 1593. The Patriarch of Moscow became the head of \\"all Russia and Northern countries\\", and Chernihiv (now in Ukraine) was one of his dioceses. However, he had no power among the Orthodox bishops of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, who remained under the rule of Constantinople. At the same time, the Orthodox hierarchs of those lands were inclined to the Union with Rome, despite the resistance of their parishes, who formed the Orthodox brotherhoods (or fraternities) to keep their identity. On the way from Moscow, Jeremiah II visited the lands of present-day Ukraine and committed an unprecedented act, granting Stauropegia (direct subordination to the Patriarch) to many Orthodox brotherhoods. This provoked the anger of the local bishops and soon the Union of Brest was proclaimed, which was supported by the majority of the Orthodox bishops of the Commonwealth, including Metropolitan Michail Rogoza. Officially, the Orthodox (but not the Eastern Catholic) Metropolis of Kyiv in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was eliminated and re-established only in 1620, in subsequent co-existence with Uniate Metropolis. That led to sharp conflict and numerous revolts culminating in the Khmelnytsky uprising. In 1654, Russia entered the war with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; it quickly occupied, for a while, the lands of present Belarus, and gained some power over the Hetmanate pursuant to the Pereyaslav Agreement (1654). The official title of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow was \\"Patriarch of Moscow and all Greater, Lesser, and White Russia\\". However, the Metropolitan of Kyiv Sylvester Kossov had managed to defend his independence from the Moscow Patriarchate. The Moscow government, which needed the support of the Orthodox clergy, postponed the resolution of this issue. In 1686, Ecumenical Patriarch Dionysius IV approved the new Metropolitan of Kyiv, Gedeon Chetvertinsky, who would be ordained by the Moscow Patriarchate and thus transferred, albeit with certain qualifications, a part of the Kyiv ecclesiastical province to the jurisdiction of Patriarchate of Moscow (the Russian Orthodox Church). In the 1924 Tomos (decree) of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which granted independence to the Polish Orthodox Church, the previous transfer of the Kyivan Church to the jurisdiction of Moscow (in 1685‚Äì1686) was declared uncanonical.1924 Tomos of Ecumenical Patriarchate ‚Äì Holy Greek Pan Orthodox Autocephalous Archdiocese Canada and America with Holy Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Archdiocese in Exile (Blessings of Kiev). In addition, the decree pointed out that the conditions of the synodal \\"Act\\" of 1686 ‚Äì which specified that the Russian Orthodox Church was only to consecrate the Metropolitan of Kyiv ‚Äì were never adhered to by the Patriarchate of Moscow.  Post-Cold War, claims of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and Russkiy mir The historical rivalry between the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Russian Orthodox Church intensified after the Cold War. Indeed, after the Cold War, Moscow and Constantinople both emerged as \\"two centers of Orthodox power\\".  Claims of the Ecumenical Patriarchate  The Patriarchate of Constantinople claims that:  Russkiy mir  Russkiy mir (literally \\"Russian world\\") is an ideology promoted by many in the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church. \\"This ideology, concocted as a reaction to the loss of Russian control over Ukraine and Belarus after the fall of the Soviet Union, seeks to assert a spiritual and cultural unity of the peoples descended from the Kyivan Rus, presumably under Russian leadership.\\" Patriarch Kiril of Moscow also shares this ideology; for the Russian Orthodox Church, the russkiy mir is also \\"a spiritual concept, a reminder that through the baptism of Rus', God consecrated these people to the task of building a Holy Rus.\\" On 31 January 2019, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow declared concerning the religious relationship between the Russian Orthodox Church and Ukraine: \\"Ukraine is not on the periphery of our church. We call Kyiv 'the mother of all Russian cities.' For us Kyiv is what Jerusalem is for many. Russian Orthodoxy began there, so under no circumstances can we abandon this historical and spiritual relationship. The whole unity of our Local Church is based on these spiritual ties.\\"  1996 schism over Estonia  The Moscow‚ÄìConstantinople schism of 1996 began on 23 February 1996, when the Russian Orthodox Church severed full communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and ended on 16 May 1996 when the Russian Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate reached an agreement establishing parallel jurisdictions. The excommunication was in response to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's decision on 20 February 1996 to reestablish an autonomous Orthodox church in Estonia under the Ecumenical Patriarchate's jurisdiction. The 1996 schism has similarities with the schism of October 2018: both schisms were caused by a dispute between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate concerning the canonical jurisdiction over a territory in Eastern Europe over which the Russian Orthodox Church claimed to have the exclusive canonical jurisdiction, such territory being a part of the former Soviet Union, which upon its collapse had become an independent state (Ukraine in 2018, Estonia in 1996). The break of communion in 1996 was made by Moscow unilaterally, as in 2018.  September 2018: Russian Orthodox synod's \\"retaliatory measures\\" and the aftermath  On 14 September 2018, in response to the appointment of two exarchs (deputies of the Ecumenical Patriarch) in Ukraine, and Hilarion (Rudnyk), and in response to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's plans to grant autocephalous status to the Eastern Orthodox church in Ukraine, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church held an extraordinary session to take \\"retaliatory measures\\" and decided: A statement was released the same day explaining the situation and the sanctions taken to protest against the Ecumenical Patriarch's behavior. On the same day, Metropolitan Hilarion clarified the situation in an interview, stating that this decision is not a rupture of Eucharistic communion and does not concern the laity, but nonetheless added: On 23 September 2018 Patriarch Bartholomew, during a Divine Liturgy he was celebrating in the Saint Fokas Orthodox church declared that he \\"had sent a message that Ukraine would receive autocephaly as soon as possible, since it is entitled to it\\" On 30 September 2018, in an interview to Izvestia Daily published on the official website of the , Metropolitan Hilarion commented: \\"The Russian Church does not need to fear isolation. If Constantinople continues its anti-canonical actions, it will place itself outside the canonical space, outside the understanding of church order that distinguishes the Orthodox Church.\\" On 2 October, Patriarch Kirill of the ROC sent a letter to all the autocephalous Orthodox churches to ask them to hold a \\"Pan-Orthodox discussion\\" concerning the question of Ukraine's autocephaly. On 5 October, the Metropolitan Pavel, head of the Belarusian Orthodox Church (exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church), announced there would be a meeting of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on 15 October in Minsk. He said that \\"The situation with the Orthodox Church in Ukraine will be on the agenda of the meeting\\". This meeting had been announced previously on 7 January 2018 and was at the time \\"most likely to take place in mid October.\\" On 9 October, Metropolitan Hilarion, chairman of the Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church warned that \\"if the project for Ukrainian autocephaly is carried through, it will mean a tragic and possibly irretrievable schism of the whole Orthodoxy.\\" He added that  Autocephaly of the Eastern Orthodox church in Ukraine  On 11 October 2018 the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate announced that it would grant autocephaly to the \\"Church of Ukraine\\" in the future. In the same decision the Holy synod announced that it will immediately: reestablish a stauropegion (church body ruled directly by the Ecumenical Patriarch) in Kyiv, revoke the legal binding of the letter of 1686, and lift the excommunications which affected clergy and faithful of two Ukrainian Orthodox churches (the UOC-KP and the UAOC). Those two churches, the UOC-KP and the UAOC, were competing with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (UOC-MP) and were considered \\"schismatics\\" (illegally segregated groups) by the Patriarchate of Moscow, as well as by the other Orthodox churches. This decision led the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church to break full communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 15 October 2018, which marked the beginning of the 2018 Moscow‚ÄìConstantinople schism. Support for the grant of autocephaly had been expressed by the Ukrainian President and the Verkhovna Rada in June 2018, and before that by the Rada in June 2016. On 15 December 2018, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was formed after a unification council between the UAOC, the UOC-KP, and two bishops of the UOC- MP; Epiphanius was elected primate of the OCU during this unification council. Most of the hierarchs of the UOC-MP ignored the council and over half of them had sent invites back to the Ecumenical Patriarch. On 5 January 2019, Bartholomew I, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, signed the official decree (tomos) that granted autocephaly (independence) to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and officially established the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. On 6 January, after a Liturgy celebrated by Metropolitan Epiphanius and Patriarch Bartholomew, Partriarch Bartholomew read the tomos of the OCU and then gave it to Metropolitan Epiphanius. On 8 January 2019, the tomos was brought back to Istanbul so that all the members of the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate could sign the tomos. The tomos was signed by all members of the Holy synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 9 January 2019. The tomos, signed by all members of the Holy synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, was brought back to Ukraine on the morning of 10 January 2019. Right after the granting of the tomos of autocephaly to the OCU (6 January 2019), a leadership conflict arose within the OCU.

This decision forbade for any member of the ROC (both clergy and laity) joint participation in all sacraments, including communion, baptism, and marriage, at any church worldwide controlled by Constantinople. At the time of the schism, the Russian Orthodox Church had over 150 million followers, more than half of all Eastern Orthodox Christians. The same day, after the synod, a briefing for journalists was given by Metropolitan Hilarion, chairman of the , in which he declared that \\"the decision on complete cessation of the Eucharistic communion with the Patriarchate of Constantinople was taken today.\\" On 18 October 2018, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia has expressed \\"complete support of the position taken by the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Moscow, following its meeting of 15th October 2018\\" and severed Eucharistic communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The break of communion was done in response to a decision of the Holy synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 11 October 2018 which confirmed the intention of moving towards granting autocephaly (independence) to the Eastern Orthodox Church in Ukraine, and to immediately: reestablish a stauropegion (church body ruled directly by the Ecumenical Patriarch) in Kyiv, revoke the legal binding of the letter of 1686, and lift the excommunications which affected clergy and faithful of two Ukrainian Orthodox churches. Those two churches, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP), were competing with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) (UOC-MP) and were considered \\"schismatics\\" (illegally segregated groups) by the Patriarchate of Moscow, as well as by the other Orthodox churches. Doctor in theology of the UOC-MP argued that the break of communion between the churches of Moscow and Constantinople did not constitute a real schism (like the schism of 1054), but a \\"slit\\". The American Protestant magazine Christianity Today called the break of communion between the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Russian Orthodox Church the \\"biggest schism since 1054\\" and \\"the biggest Christian schism since the Protestant Reformation\\" On 17 October, Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the Moscow Patriarchate Department for External Church Relations, was interviewed by the BBC Russian Service; this interview was published on the official website of the Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church the very same day. Hilarion declared: \\"As of today, we have very clearly stated: the fact that the Patriarchate of Constantinople has recognized a schismatic structure means for us that Constantinople itself is now in schism. It has identified itself with a schism. Accordingly, we cannot have the full Eucharistic communion with it.\\" Hilarion added that when members of the Russian Orthodox of Moscow Patriarchate pay visits to the monasteries on Mount Athos, they cannot participate in the sacraments (for example, receive communion), and promised punishment to any priests who participate in the divine services together with the local clergy. It is known that Russia makes large donations to the monasteries on Athos: the sum of $200 million was announced by a source close to the Moscow Patriarchate and confirmed by Hilarion in his interview. Hilarion hinted that \\"[h]istory shows that when Athos is concerned over something, the monasteries on the Holy Mountain do find ways to inform the Patriarch of Constantinople about it\\" and called on Russian businessmen to switch donations to Russian sacred places. On 29 December, during an interview to the channel Russia-24, Metropolitan Hilarion declared the Patriarch of Moscow had informed during the last meeting of the Supreme Diocesan Assembly of Moscow that that faithfuls of the ROC could communicate in the territory of the Mount Athos, but only in the Saint Panteleimon Monastery. The territory of the Mount Athos is under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Hilarion declared the Saint Panteleimon Monastery \\"belongs to the Constantinople Church, as do all monasteries on Mt. Athos, but we know that it was built with Russian money by Russian monks and houses a Russian and Ukrainian monastic brotherhood, all rites are performed in a Slavic language and the laity who come there may take communion in it ... But not in other Athos monasteries\\".  Break of communion with the Archbishop of Athens  On 17 October 2019, the Holy synod of the ROC reacted to the announcement that the Church of Greece had recognized the OCU. The Holy Synod stated: \\"If the Ukrainian schism is really recognized by the Greek Orthodox Church and its Primate ‚Äì either in the form of a joint service, liturgical commemoration of the leader of the schism or sending official letters to them ‚Äì it will be a sad testimony to the deepening division in the family of local Orthodox Churches. [...] We cease the prayer and Eucharistic communion with those bishops of the Greek Church who have entered or will enter into communion with representatives of the Ukrainian non-canonical schismatic communities. [...] the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church authorizes his Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all Russia to stop the commemoration of the name of His Beatitude Archbishop of Athens and the entire Greece in the diptychs if the Primate of the Greek Church begins to commemorate the head of one of the Ukrainian schismatic groups during divine services or takes other actions indicating the recognition of the Ukrainian schism.\\" In the same statement, the Holy Synod announced that the ROC would not be blessing pilgrimages of faithfuls of the ROC to Greek dioceses whose hierarchs are in communion with representatives of the OCU. On 21 October 2019, Archbishop Ieronymos II of Athens and all Greece, the primate of the Church of Greece, sent a peaceful letter to Epiphanius, the primate of the OCU. This decision was supported by the whole hierarchy (bishops) of the Church of Greece, minus 7 Metropolitans; the Metropolitan of Piraeus later said he in fact did not support this decision, explaining: \\"My phrase 'I disagree but support the archbishop' was distorted beyond recognition.\\" This decision meant that the Church of Greece recognized the OCU. The head of the external relations department of the ROC, Metropolitan Hilarion, stated that the ROC regretted this decision and that \\"the Greek Church is not independent, there is no full autocephaly, full independence, half of its hierarchs are hierarchs of the Constantinople Patriarchate, it does not have its own external policy, and therefore it always follows in the footsteps of the Constantinople Patriarchate.\\" Hilarion stated that he hoped \\"no other regional church will follow this sad example.\\" Thereafter, the Pilgrim Centre of the Patriarchate of Moscow, which is the official pilgrimage centre of the Moscow Patriarchate, released a list of dioceses of the Church of Greece which were considered \\"undesirable for pilgrimage\\" and to which the pilgrims of the Russian Orthodox Church were \\"not blessed\\" to go in pilgrimage. This list namely contained the diocese of Athens of the primate of the Church of Greece. This list was done on the basis of 17 October 2019 decision of the Holy Synod of the ROC not to bless pilgrimages to dioceses whose hierarchs etnter in communion with representatives of the OCU. On 2 November, Metropolitan Hilarion stated: \\"We said that if the archbishop of Athens officially recognizes the Ukrainian schism, his name will be removed from the diptychs of the Russian Orthodox Church. What does that mean? It means that the patriarch will not mention the archbishop of Athens in his services, the same way as he is not mentioning the patriarch of Constantinople. I think he will not be mentioned this coming Sunday when the patriarch holds his service. That means we are stopping Eucharistic communion with the archbishop of Athens.\\" On Sunday, 3 November 2019, Patriarch Kirill did not mention the primate of the Church of Greece in the liturgy, removing him from the diptych.  Break of communion with the Patriarch of Alexandria  On 8 November 2019, the Moscow Patriarchate announced that Patriarch Kirill would stop commemorating the Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa after the latter and his Church recognized the OCU that same day. On 25 November 2019, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow temporarily suspended the Moscow mission of the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa. The future closing of the representation of the Patriarchate of Alexandria in Moscow was announced. On 6 December 2019, the Holy Synod of the UOC-MP announced it had severted eucharistic communion \\"with the Patriarchate of Constantinople and with the Churches and hierarchs who have recognised the schismatics\\" On 24 December 2019, Metropolitan Hilarion said that \\"[i]f the Patriarchate of Alexandria sides with the schism, then we might, of course, have to create parishes for our believers, because they won't be able to take communion at churches of the Patriarchate of Alexandria.\\" Two days later, the Synod of the ROC in Moscow announced it severed full communion with the Patriarch of Alexandria and ceased commemorating him. In addition, the Synod of Moscow decided to suspend the activities of the metochion (embassy) of the Alexandrian Patriarchate under the Moscow Patriarchate. It was also decided that the Representation of the Patriarchate of Moscow under the Patriarchate of Alexandria in Cairo would become a parish of the ROC. As for the parishes of the ROC in Africa, they will be removed from the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Alexandria and will be granted stauropegial status, that is, they will be transferred to the direct subordination of the head of the ROC, Patriarch Kirill. Further escalation  Russian priests in Turkey  On 10 November 2018, Metropolitan Hilarion, heads of the Moscow Patriarchate's Office for External Relations said during a TV program on Russia-24 that the ROC had no choice but to \\"send priests of the Russian Orthodox Church\\" to Turkey, \\"[a]nd this will continue as long as the Patriarch of Constantinople is in schism\\". He said the ROC did not do so before because Turkey is a territory of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, but that the ROC now does because the Ecumenical Patriarchate is in schism. On 12 November 2018, it was reported that the first priest was sent by Patriarch Kirill to Istanbul (Turkey) \\"at the request of Russian believers who live in Turkey\\". On the same day, the Russian Orthodox Church announced a divine liturgy had been held on 11 November in Istanbul and would be regularly held. The ROC also reported the words of the priest who had led the divine liturgy who said that after the 15 October 2018 decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, numerous Russian Orthodox believers of Turkey had asked the Moscow Patriarchate to provide them with \\"pastoral care\\". On 14 December the Ecumenical Patriarchate published a statement by Metropolitan Sotirios of Pisidia in which he condemned the plans of the ROC priest to celebrate a Divine Liturgy in Belek (Turkey) with the help of the Russian consulate and without the permission of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which has canonical jurisdiction over this territory. On 30 December 2018, Interfax reported that the ROC was building a church on the territory of the embassy of Russia in Ankara.  Dissolution of the AROCWE  On 27 November 2018 the Ecumenical Patriarchate decided to dissolve the Archdiocese of Russian Orthodox churches in Western Europe (AROCWE) \\"thereby entrusting its faithful to the Hierarchs of the Ecumenical Throne in Europe\\". ROC officials responded with a reminder of the 2003 proposal of Alexy II to move to the Moscow Patriarchate. This decision was made without any official requests from the hierarchs of the diocese and caused confusion. On 15 December Pastoral Assembly of AROCWE decided to call an Extraordinary General Assembly (EGA), scheduled for 23 February 2019. On 23 February 191 out of the 206 voters of EGA voted against the dissolution. At the next Extraordinary General Assembly on 7 September 2019, 104 voters out of the 186 (58.1%) voted in favor of the AROCWE being subordinated to the Moscow Patriarchate, but that was less than two-thirds of the votes needed to make such a decision. Despite this, the head of AROCWE on 14 September personally came under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. On 3 November, the AROCWE delegation in Moscow received a letter on the reunification of the Archdiocese with the Moscow Patriarchate. Some of AROCWE members joined the newly established \\"Vicariate of Russian Tradition of the Metropolis of France\\" which remained faithful to the Ecumenical Patriarchate.  Creation of the PEWE and the PESEA  On 26 November 2018, Metropolitan Hilarion declared that the ROC would send a priest in South Korea and declared the plans \\"to create a full- fledged parish\\", because until the 1950s in Korea was a Russian Spiritual Mission whose faithful were in the 1950s transferred to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's jurisdiction. The priest was scheduled to be sent by the end of the year. On 28 December 2018, in response to the Ecumenical Patriarchate's actions in Ukraine, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church decided to create the Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe (PEWE), the Spanish- Portuguese diocese, as well as the Patriarchal Exarchate in South-East Asia (PESEA). On the same day, in an interview with Russia-24 channel, Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the ROC, declared the ROC \\"will now act as if they [Constantinople] do not exist at all because our purpose is missionary, our task is to educate, we are creating these structures for ministerial care about our flock, there can be no such deterring factors here\\", and that the ROC will take charge of the Orthodox faithfuls of its diaspora instead of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.  Further protests by the ROC  On 26 February, during the first 2019 session of the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate, the Holy synod adopted a statement saying that the granting of the tomos by the Ecumenical Patriarchate \\"to the so-called 'Orthodox church of Ukraine,' created artificially by a merger of two schismatic organizations, deepened the division between [Eastern] Orthodox Christians in Ukraine and worsened ever more considerably the inter-confessional relations.\\" The ROC also blamed the action of the Ukrainian parliament regarding the UOC-MP. On 7 October 2019, the ROC officially released a comments by the Secretariat of the Biblical and Theological Synodal Commission of the Russian Orthodox Church. \\"The document discusses the problems of apostolic succession among schismatic \\"hierarchs\\", the limits of application of the oikonomia principle, issues of the lack of legitimacy of the OCU, the distortion of the role of the first bishop in the Orthodox Church, and explains the suspension of Eucharistic communion.\\"  Omission of commemoration of all other primates by Patriarch Kirill  On 7 January 2019, during the festive Christmas liturgy in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, Patriarch Kirill of the ROC did not mention a single name of the primates of other local Orthodox Churches, with whom the ROC is in canonical communion. Such commemoration is demanded by a church charter and is a centuries-old tradition. In contrast to this, the head of the newly created Orthodox Church of Ukraine, Metropolitan Epiphanius, solemnly listed the names of all the primates, including the \\"Most Holy Patriarch of Russia Kirill\\". Epiphanius later explained that he had done this after the Ecumenical Patriarch had instructed him (Epiphanius) to do so, and that Filaret had instructed him not to mention Kirill. On 20 November 2019, during the patriarchal liturgy, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow did not commemorate by name any of the primates of the local Eastern Orthodox Churches, saying only \\"Remember, Lord, the Orthodox Patriarchs.\\" On 21 November 2019, Patriarch Kyrill and Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem concelebrated a liturgy together. During this liturgy, they commemorated each others, but did not commemorate any of the other Eastern Orthodox primates.  Reactions   International community  * Russia: On 12 October 2018, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, \\"held an operational meeting with the permanent members of the Security Council\\" (the Security Council of Russia) that discussed \\"a wide range of domestic and foreign policy issues, including the situation around the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\\", according to Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov. On 31 January 2019, concerning Ukraine Putin declared that the Russian authorities \\"consider any interference in church affairs absolutely unacceptable.\\" Putin added: \\"We have respected and will respect the independence of church affairs, especially in a neighboring sovereign country. And yet we reserve the right to respond and do all we can to protect human rights, including the right to freedom of religion\\". * Ukraine: Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, enthusiastically welcomed Constantinople's October decision, and presented the Ukrainian Church's independence as part of Ukraine's wider conflict with Russia, and Ukraine's desire to integrate with the West by joining the European Union and NATO. On 28 November 2018, Ukrainian President Poroshenko declared that the Kerch Strait incident was provoked by Russia in order to force Ukraine to declare martial law and therefore to prevent Ukraine from receiving its tomos of autocephaly. * United States: The Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, urged all sides to respect the independence of \\"Ukraine's Orthodox community\\", reiterating the United States' \\"strong support for religious freedom and the freedom of members of religious groups\\". * Belarus: the President of Belarus, the country in which the synod of the Russian Orthodox Church which decided to severe communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate took place, met members of the synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on 15 October 2018 after the ROC's decision to sever communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate. * Montenegro: On 21 December 2018, the Montenegrin President said the State of Montenegro had the responsibility to consolidate the autocephaly of the unrecognized Montenegrin Orthodox Church. On 11 June 2019, the Montenegrin President said he hoped for a \\"Ukrainian scenario\\" so that the Montenegrin Church could be recognized as autocephalous.  Reactions of the Eastern Orthodox churches  Numerous Orthodox churches took position concerning the question of the canonical jurisdiction over Ukraine, whether before or after this schism.  Canonical issues  The schism has its root in a dispute over who between the Patriarchate of Moscow and the Patriarchate of Constantinople has canonical jurisdiction over the See of Kyiv and, therefore, which patriarchate has canonical jurisdiction over the territory of Ukraine. \\"[T]he principal argument proposed [concerning the granting of the ecclesiastical status of autocephaly to Ukraine by the Ecumenical Patriarchate] is that Ukraine \\"constitutes the canonical territory of the Patriarchate of Moscow\\" and that, consequently, such an act on the part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate would comprise an \\"intervention\\" into a foreign ecclesiastical jurisdiction.\\" The Patriarchate of Moscow's claim of canonical jurisdiction is based mostly on two documents: the Patriarchal and Synodal \\"Act\\" or \\"Letter of Issue\\" of 1686, and a 1686 Patriarchal Letter to the Kings of Russia. Both those documents are reproduced in the \\"Appendix\\" section of a study published by the Ecumenical Patriarch called The Ecumenical Throne and the Ukrainian Church ‚Äì The Documents Speak. The Church of Constantinople claims the Church of Constantinople has canonical jurisdiction over the See of Kyiv and that the documents upon which the Russian Orthodox Church bases its claim of jurisdiction over said See of Kyiv do not support the ROC's claim. On 1 July 2018, the Patriarch Bartholomew said that Constantinople was the Mother church of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and declared that The ROC considers this argument \\"groundles[s]\\".  Ecumenical Patriarchate's claims  The Ecumenical Patriarchate issued a document authored by various clerics and theologians called The Ecumenical Throne and the Ukrainian Church ‚Äì The Documents Speak. This document analyzes canonical historic documents (namely the Patriarchal and Synodal \\"Act\\" or \\"Letter of Issue\\" of 1686 and the 1686 Patriarchal Letter to the Kings of Russia) to see if the claim over the See of Kyiv by the Patriarchate of Moscow is canonical or not. The Ecumenical Throne and the Ukrainian Church concludes that: On 27 December 2016, Konstantinos Vetochnikov wrote that the transfer of the See of Kyiv from the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church \\"never took place\\". Later, Vetoshnikov made an analysis of the arguments of the Russian Orthodox Church. He pointed out that, according to the strict dogmatic approach (akribeia, ·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒØŒ≤ŒµŒπŒ±), the whole territory of Russia was originally subjected to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. After Muscovy had gone into schism in the 15th century, it received autocephaly according to a more flexible approach (oikonomia, Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒØŒ±) to heal this schism. The Metropolitan of Kyiv at the same time remained within the jurisdiction of Constantinople. Then, also according to the oikonomia approach, the right to ordain Metropolitans of Kyiv was transferred to the Patriarch of Moscow. This was not a change in the boundaries of the Moscow Patriarchate eparchy, as it was issued by a document of a lower level (ekdosis, ·ºêŒ∫Œ¥œåœÉŒµœâœÇ), which was used for various temporary solutions. For pastoral reasons, the Ecumenical Patriarchate subsequently did not assert its rights to this territory. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union there was a split among the Orthodox of Ukraine, and the Russian Church for 30 years failed to overcome this split. And now, also for pastoral reasons, the Ecumenical Patriarchate was forced to act in accordance with the principle of akribeia, and so it decided to abolish the right to ordain Metropolitans of Kyiv which had been earlier transferred to the Moscow Patriarchate in accordance with oikonomia.  Arguments against the Ecumenical Patriarchate's claims  On 20 August 2018, the pro-Moscow anonymous site Union of Orthodox Journalists analysed the Ecumenical Patriarchate's claim of jurisdiction over Ukraine and concluded the See of Kyiv had been transferred to the Patriarchate of Moscow. They added that even if the Ecumenical Patriarchate decided to abrogate the 1686 transfer, the territory covered in 1686 by the See of Kyiv's territory was \\"a far cry from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of today\\" and covered less than half of Ukraine's current territory. In its 15 October 2018 official statement, the Russian Orthodox Church gave counterarguments to the Ecumenical Patriarch's arguments. Metropolitan Hilarion, chairman of the Moscow Patriarchate's Department for External Church Relations, declared in an interview that Constantinople's plan to \\"grant Autocephaly to a part of the Russian Orthodox Church [...] that once was subordinate to Constantinople [...] runs counter to historic truth\\". His argument is that the entire territory of Ukraine has not been under Constantinople's jurisdiction for 300 years because the Kyiv metropolis that was incorporated into the Moscow Patriarchate in 1686 was much smaller (it did not include Donbass, Odessa and some other regions) and therefore does not coincide with the present-day territory of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. A similar argument was given on 13 November in a live phone interview to Radio Liberty by the Head of the Information and Education Department of the UOC-MP, Archbishop Clement. Archbishop Clement of the UOC-MP considers that \\"to revoke the letter on the transfer of the Kyiv Metropolis in 1686 is the same as to cancel the decisions of the Ecumenical Councils of the 4th or 7th centuries.\\" On 8 November 2018, the Union of Orthodox Journalists analyzed the same documents as The Ecumenical Throne and the Ukrainian Church (the Patriarchal and Synodal \\"Act\\" or \\"Letter of Issue\\" of 1686 and the 1686 Patriarchal Letter to the Kings of Russia) and again concluded that the See of Kyiv had been \\"completely transferred to the jurisdiction of the Russian Church in 1686\\".  Possibility of a pan-Orthodox synaxis on the question of Ukraine  The possibility of a pan-Orthodox synaxis (consultative assembly or conference) has been raised before and after the official break of communion. On 29 September 2018, , the press secretary of the Patriarch of Moscow, declared that the local Orthodox churches may initiate a pan-Orthodox Synaxis on the issue of granting autocephaly to the Church in Ukraine, however the problem was that the convening such a synaxis is \\"a prerogative of the First among the Equals, that is, the Ecumenical Patriarch\\". Volkov noted that On 7 November, answering the question \\"Who could, for instance, convene a Pan- Orthodox Council and chair it?\\", Metropolitan Hilarion declared in an interview, which was published on the official website of the Russian Orthodox Church's Department for External Church Relations, that it was \\"obvious\\" that the Ecumenical Patriarch could not chair a Pan-Orthodox Council since \\"the most important problems in the Orthodox world are linked with precisely his anti-canonical activity\\". On 4 December, when asked about the fact that convoking a pan-Orthodox council was a prerogative of the Ecumenical Patriarch, Metropolitan Hilarion replied: In an interview published on 21 February 2019 in the Serbian magazine Politika, the Ecumenical Patriarch said: \\"As for the provision of autocephaly with the consent of other Orthodox Churches, this did not happen, because it is not a tradition in our Church. All the Tomoses of the autocephaly that were granted to the newly created autocephalous churches (Russia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Athens, Warsaw, Tirana and Presov) were provided by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and this was not preceded by any agreement or negotiation at the Pan-Orthodox level.\\" Thus far, Patriarch John X of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch, Patriarch Irinej of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Archbishop Chrysostomos II of the Church of Cyprus, Metropolitan Sawa (Hrycuniak) of the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Tikhon of the Orthodox Church in America, Archbishop Anastasios, primate of the Albanian Orthodox Church, three hierarchs of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitans Gabriel of Lovech, John of Varna and Veliki Preslav, and Daniel of Vedin), and the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia have expressed their desire for a pan-Orthodox synaxis or pan-Orthodox council over the question of Ukraine in various statements. On 12 November 2018, the Assembly of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church of published a communiqu√© in which they requested the convocation of a Pan-Orthodox Synod. In 2019, the Ecumenical Patriarch declared in a letter to Patriarch John X of Antioch that he would not convene a pan-Orthodox council on the question of Ukraine.  Proposal of the Patriarch of Jerusalem  On 21 November 2019, Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem announced he would like to gather in Jordan with the other Eastern Orthodox primates \\"in the spirit of fellowship ‚Äì koinonia ‚Äì so that counsel will be taken together for the preservation of our unity in Eucharistic communion.\\" This initiative was welcomed by the ROC; Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the DECR, also added that the Patriarchate of Jerusalem had a \\"historic primacy\\" within the Eastern Orthodox Church. In December 2019, the Holy Synods of the OCCLS and of the ROC supported the proposal of meeting. On 22 November, the primate of the Church of Greece declined the invitation. At the beginning of January, the primate of the Church of Cyprus said he had not replied to the invitation because he \\"considered it prudent not to answer\\" and did not consider this meeting a \\"serious act\\", and added that \\"only the Ecumenical Patriarch, no one else\\" had the right to convene such a council. At few days later, the answer of the Ecumenical Patriarch to the letter of invitation of the Patriarch of Jerusalem was reported; the Ecumenical Patriarch stated he refused the invitation and asked the Patriarch of Jerusalem to stop his initiative of meeting. A few days later, the primate of the Church of Greece reiterated that he would not attend Patriarch Theophilos III's meeting. Later, it was reported that the Orthodox Churches of Albania, Poland, Alexandria, Georgia, Bulgaria and Antioch had stated they would not come. The Romanian Orthodox Church said it would be present at the gathering, but would not be presented by its Patriarch but by a delegation. The gathering took place on 26 February 2020. Were present the delegations of: the ROC with Patriarch Kirill as leader, the Church of Jerusalem with Patriarch Theophilos as leader, the Serbian Church with Patriarch Irinej as leader, the OCCLS with primate Met. Ratislav as leader, the Polish Church with Abp. Abel (Poplavsky) of Lublin as leader, and the Romanian Church with Met. as leader. After the gathering, the participants released a common statement.

She has discussed her hope that contemporary artists can help to evolve human consciousness by changing the ways that humans sense the planet, using the term ‚Äúsymbiontics‚Äù (a word composed of the words symbiosis and ontic). Her 2017 Global Work of Art: World's Fairs, Biennials, and the Aesthetics of Experience is a history of the idea of \\"globalism\\" over a century of international art biennials. Her book Experience: Culture, Cognition, and the Common Sense (2016) was co-edited by Jones along with David Mather and Rebecca Uchill. That book convened conversation with artists, musicians, philosophers, anthropologists, historians, and neuroscientists who explore the concept of \\"experience\\" across scientific, sensorial, and cultural realms. Jones contributed an interview with artist Anicka Yi to the 2016 book Anicka Yi: 6,070,430K of Digital Spit, published in conjunction with the 2015 exhibition by the same title at the List Visual Arts Center. Jones was one of the subjects of Yi's work in her 2015 exhibition You Can Call Me F, for which one hundred women contributed biological material to the gallery at The Kitchen. Yi intended with this work to align \\"society‚Äôs growing paranoia around contagion and hygiene (both public and private) with the enduring patriarchal fear of feminism and potency of female networks.\\" Jones authored Eyesight Alone: Clement Greenberg's Modernism and the Bureaucratization of the Senses (2006), which demonstrates how theories of modernism in the work of controversial art critic Clement Greenberg were connected to his desire to prioritize, and therefore isolate, the sense of sight. Jones's book connects Greenberg's influential opinions in the category of art to positivist scientific philosophy and a culture of \\"bureaucratization of the senses.\\"  Awards  Jones was a National Humanities Center Fellow in 2017-2018, a Radcliffe Fellow in 2013-2014, and a Guggenheim Fellow in 1999. She is also the recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Newhouse Center for the Humanities at Wellesley College (2009‚Äì10), the Institute national d'histoire de l'art in Paris (2006-7), the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, the Max Planck Instit√ºt (2001-2), the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton (1994‚Äì95), and the Stanford Humanities Center (1986‚Äì87).

Founded in 1995 by former racing driver and engineer Rudi Walch, the team has been involved in multiple international series, primarily the FIA GT Championship. The team were the vice champions of the N-GT category of the FIA GT Championship in 2000 and 2001. Since 2003, RWS has concentrated on historic motorsport and vehicle restoration, repair, and sales. History After racing for Schnitzer Motorsport in the 1970s, Rudi Walch became involved with Brun Motorsport as a driver before becoming a technical engineer for the team in 1983. After Brun was liquidated in 1993, Walch acquired much of the former team's equipment as well as hiring former personnel to form RWS Motorsport in 1995. The new team initially competed selectively in the BPR Global GT Series with a Porsche 911 GT2, a car which they would campaign for several years. In 1997 the BPR series became the FIA GT Championship, and RWS with Italian drivers Luca Riccitelli and Raffaele Sangiuolo competed in the bulk of the races in the season. RWS concentrated on the inaugural GTR Euroseries for 1998, a series intended for teams with amateur drivers, before returning to FIA GT in 1999 with the father-son duo of Horst Felbermayr and Horst Felbermayr Jr. The team also added sports prototype racing in the SportsRacing World Cup with a Riley & Scott-BMW with Riccitelli joining G√ºnther Blieninger, and ran a partial season of the American Le Mans Series after one-off visits to the Rolex 24 at Daytona in the United States the previous years. In 2000 Porsche introduced the new 911 GT3-R for the FIA GT Championship's new N-GT category. RWS, with new drivers Philipp Peter and Dieter Quester and the backing of Quester's sponsor Red Bull, purchased two new cars. The team introduced their new purchase at the Rolex 24 at Daytona where they finished tenth overall and second in the GTU class. Back in Europe, the team won FIA GT races at Circuit Zolder and EuroSpeedway Lausitz en route to second in the teams' championship and Riccitelli finished second in the drivers' championship. Quester and Riccitelli paired up for 2001, winning at Brno Circuit before following it up with a 5th place finish and class victory at the Spa 24 Hours. The team finished the season tied on points with JMB Competition for the N-GT Championship but were deemed second place on the tie- breaker. Riccitelli finished second in the drivers' championship while Quester was third. RWS split their season in 2002, campaigning the GT3-R in the N-GT category for Russians Aleksey Vasilyev and Nikolai Fomenko while also developing a variant of the GT3-R for the GT category for Riccitelli and Quester. The resulting 911 GT, which featured an enlarged and more powerful motor, struggled and was abandoned after the third round of the season, while Quester and Riccitelli later moved to another team within the series. The N-GT campaign netted a fourth place championship result. Vasilyev and Fomenko increased their involvement in the team in 2003, bringing Russian Yukos title sponsorship as they returned to a two-car N-GT entry, but the season was winless and the duo would take their sponsor and move to Freisinger Motorsport in 2004. RWS would then turn to the restoration of racing cars and road car repairs, occasionally competing in historic racing and support of other racing teams. An RWS-backed SEAT Le√≥n won the TCR category of the 2016 24 Hours of N√ºrburgring.

It lies in Veerakeralampudur taluk, which itself is in Tenkasi district.  History  The village was once governed by what anthropologist Nicholas Dirks terms \\"little kings\\", who were polygars from the Maravar caste. Theirs was the largest in area, although not in population, of several Maravar- governed lands in what is now Tirunelveli district. The lands formed a part of the 1803 Permanent Settlement in Madras Presidency and became recognised by the British East India Company (EIC) as a zamindari estate, with its palace at Veerakeralampudur. In 1823, it comprised , with a population of 14,612; administratively situated in Tenkasi taluk by 1917, it was the third-largest of all the zamindaris in the district, comprising 63 villages spread over an area of , with an estimated population of 51,246. The zamindari estates of the area arose in the aftermath of the Polygar Wars, when the British conferred the status on those who they deemed not to have been subversive. Uthumalai had sided with them in opposition to Polygar rebels such as Veerapandiya Kattabomman. The little kings were now expected to be landlords who managed local agriculture and paid an annual tribute, although even the British authorities had doubts about their transplanting of the settled property concept from its origins in Bengal Presidency to that of Madras. Despite its zamindari status, in the first half of the century the British East India Company often imposed direct rule, overarching the position of the zamindar. The family gained a period of relatively independent governance during the regency of Peryanayaki Nachiar, who acted on behalf of her underage son, Irudalaya Marudappa Taver, after the death of his father in 1850. As an adult ruler, Irudalaya married Annapurni Nachiar and Menakshi Sundra Nachiar, although only the latter initially joined him in his palace ‚Äì Annapurni was around six years old at the time of her marriage and so at first lived with her relatives. Those relatives assisted Irudalaya in opposing the claims of his uncle, who lived and held a title at Chokkampatti. Irudalaya was succeeded as zamindar upon his death in 1891 by an adopted son, Navanithakrishna Marudappa Taver, but the Court of Wards stepped in to govern on his behalf because he, too, was a minor. When Navanithakrishna died, a few months after his father, a family squabble broke out as Annapurni and Menakshi laid claim to the estate, each arguing that they had the closer relationship to Irudalaya and Navanithakrishna. A wide range of arguments were put forward during the legal proceedings, such as a claim that Irudalayar had been too ill in his last years to formally adopt Navanithakrishna, that he had divorced Annapurni and she had forced her way into the palace, and that Menakshi could not have taken part in any adoption process ‚Äì and thus could not be the adoptive mother ‚Äì because her menstrual cycle made her ritually polluted. The court concentrated on the divorce and ritual arguments and ruled in favour of Menakshi, a decision that was upheld by the Privy Council on appeal.  Demographics  The 2011 Census of India recorded Uthumalai as having 2168 households and a population of 7737, comprising 3788 males and 3949 females. Some of the population were categorised as members of Scheduled Castes; there were no members of Scheduled Tribes.

Early life Paul Augustus Martin was born in Herbeuville, France in 1864 in Alsace- Lorraine, but in the wake of the Franco-Prussian war and experiencing dire poverty during the Paris Commune fled with his family as a child to England in 1872. There, from 1873-1878, he attended an English school, then returned to France to continue his schooling 1878-80 at √âcole Gosserez, Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, before being apprenticed to a wood engraver 1880-1883. Photographer Martin's strong talent in drawing brought him work in Fleet Street as a wood engraver where much of his work would have involved copying photographs, wood engraving being then the means of reproducing them in newspapers.The Victoria and Albert Museum holds an album of 78 proof wood-engravings made in the first two years of Paul Martin's apprenticeshipPaul Martin biography at Historic Camera He had first experimented in photography when he was ten years old, but he was nineteen before he purchased his first dry-plate camera in 1884 and joined camera clubs to learn as much as he could about the medium. Street Photography The camera Martin used, the Fallowfield Facile detective camera, became available in 1889 and was considered a ‚Äòhand camera‚Äô.Walter D. Welford, The Hand Camera Manual: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Photography in Its Connection with the Hand Camera (London, 1893), p. 72. Constructed of mahogany with a simple reflex viewfinder on the top, rendering a waist-level view, it weighed only 1.8 kg, and was camouflaged in brown paper to resemble a parcel. Plates were stored in an internal rack and flipped down once exposed. His camera presents us with a waist-level view, a child‚Äôs perspective on the scene in effect, and equally inquisitive. Though modest and shy, during his lunch hours Martin started photographing on the surrounding streets of London, as a means of improving and testing his technique; ‚ÄúIt is impossible to describe the thrill which taking the first snaps without being noticed gave one,‚Äù he said. The people he photographed were workers and craftspeople, working class subjects less confronting than the gentry who would have felt entitled to challenge him. though his imagery of the less privileged is sympathetic, it not motivated by any urge for reform which inspired the later work of Jacob Riis, for example. Art Encyclopedia, Fine Art Photography Series, Documentary Photography The viewfinder of the camera Martin used was rudimentary and served only to aim, rather than to compose, so his pictures have a snapshot appearance, with the subject placed at centre in the frame and inclusions of unintended detail at the edges. Martin reported that reaction from fellow camera club members... Robert Leggat, 1999 biography of Martin]}} though he admitted that; In the middle of the 1890s, Martin adapted his process of making images for lantern slides; this was the final product which he showed at club meetings and in competitions. These he would mask with opaque material and a high contrast copy negative made so that the subject was isolated from the busy backgrounds for which his photographs are now so highly valued as honest records of Victorian life.The Victoria and Albert Museum holds examples of Martin's street photography as single images and in albums The strategy also protected him from any legal issues that might arise from what else the images might show, such as copyright commercial signs and from intruding on the privacy of especially upper-class who might stray into the frame.Nead, L. (2004). Animating the Everyday: London on Camera circa 1900. Journal of British Studies, 43(1), 65-90, and in As Martin explained in an article in Amateur Photographer (6 November 1896), ‚Äò‚ÄòWhen I first saw one of these slides the idea struck me . . . that living objects might be substituted for the statues.‚Äù His purpose shows in the centralised compositions which he intended later to crop and mask. Despite this stricture, and in an appeal to the prevailing Victorian taste, Martin has an eye for the anecdotal genre, the theatre of interactions between his subjects, and this is sometimes reflected in his titles, such as Ice-Cream Barrow, An Altercation (1893‚Äì96). Cecil Beaton dubbed him the 'Charles Dickens of the lens'. Night photography Martin was awarded the Royal Photographic Society‚Äôs Royal Medal in 1896, not for his lantern slides but for his series of pictures shot at night during the winter of 1895-6; London by Gaslight, one of the first serious attempts at night photography that attracted the admiration of Alfred Steiglitz, who produced his own series on Manhattan at night (1898), and prompted the formation of the amateur Society of Night Photographers. In an article for The Photogram, Martin described his experiments; his photographs on isochromatic plates required exposures of ten to fifteen minutes.The Victoria and Albert Museum holds an example of Martin's night photography; The Old Empire Theatre in Leicester Square London, of 1895. Given that his was the first photography of the city at night, his unfamiliar activities with a camera in the dark aroused the curiosity of passers-by and he was often followed by the police. Commercial photographer From 1893 to 1909, Martin was an active member of The Linked Ring group of art photographers. However, in 1899 he set up a photographic firm in partnership with H.G. Dorrett as Dorret & Martin in Westbourne Terrace, after which he no longer had time to make street photographs. His most lucrative business was portraiture and a sideline in producing button badges containing portraits of popular military figures during WW1. He also photographed historic events such as the funeral of Queen Victoria (1901), the great frost of 1895, and the coronation of Edward VII (1902). Though he sold such pictures to the press, few were published. He continued to photograph for recreation in the Cornwall, Brittany and Swiss landscapes. He closed his studio in 1926, and when his street photography started to attract the interest of collectors including Helmut Gernsheim, he gladly and cheaply sold them his remaining negatives. The producer of a number of inventions that improved the medium, he nevertheless died poor, in London in 1942.  Legacy  Paul Martin's work is held in major collections in England and America, and is frequently exhibited in themed exhibitions that recognise his pioneering contributions to the medium.

Starting as a promising talent at Hamilton Academical, he moved to Chelsea in England but was released after just over a year. He revived his career at Partick Thistle, leading Hamilton to sign him again, before he was forced to retire early due to health problems, which eventually recurred leading to his death at the age of 32. Career Hamilton Academical Born in Glasgow, McNaught began playing at Auchengill Boys Club in the city's Easterhouse district, where he was spotted by Hamilton Academical, signing for the second-tier club in 1982 (one of the last players bought in by manager Davie McParland). His combative and energetic performances drew the attention of bigger clubs, particularly during the 1985‚Äì86 Scottish First Division season which eventually culminated in Accies, led by John Lambie, winning the title and gaining promotion to the top flight for the first time in 20 years. By then, McNaught had moved on, signing for Chelsea of England's top division in May 1986 for a fee of ¬£80,000. Chelsea Having been optimistically compared to Liverpool's Danish midfielder Jan Molby by Chelsea manager John Hollins, he made his debut for the Blues at the age of 21, coming off the bench on the final matchday of the 1985‚Äì86 First Division campaign, where a makeshift side lost 5‚Äì1 at home to Watford. He started the following season in contention for a first team place, and made eight starts in the League and three in the League Cup between September 1986 and February 1987, setting up Kerry Dixon for the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 away victory over Manchester United and scoring twice past future England goalkpper David Seaman in a win over Queens Park Rangers on New Year's Day. However, he then fell out of favour as Chelsea struggled to keep their place in the division and spent the rest of season with the reserves, where his disciplinary record was poor. His final competitive appearance for the club was at the outset of 1987‚Äì88, again at Old Trafford, where he is credited in some sources as the Chelsea goalscorer in a 3‚Äì1 reverse, though the statistic is mostly recorded as an own goal by the Red Devils' goalkeeper Gary Walsh. By October 1987, with no prospect of further appearances (which would have triggered an additional payment to Hamilton) he had walked out on the club and returned to Scotland. Despite being at Chelsea for little over a year, his spell coincided with those of a large number of other Scottish players at the club: Joe McLaughlin, Les Fridge, Billy Dodds, Kevin McAllister, John Millar, Eddie Cunnington, Gordon Durie, David Speedie, Steve Clarke, Doug Rougvie and Pat Nevin. Partick Thistle and return to Hamilton After a period out of the game working as a doorman, in December 1987 McNaught signed for Partick Thistle, at that time also controlled by the Chelsea owner Ken Bates who agreed to cancel the player's contract with the London club in exchange for receiving a majority of any future transfer fee received by the Glasgow side. McNaught soon rediscovered his previous form while at Partick and in March 1988 his former manager John Lambie and club Hamilton Academical, again chasing promotion, paid a then-club record ¬£50,000 to bring him back to Douglas Park, with Partick Thistle receiving only ¬£12,500 (albeit they had acquired him for free). Hamilton did win the 1987‚Äì88 Scottish First Division, with McNaught contributing five appearances and a goal. He played twice in the Scottish Premier Division at the start of the next season (scoring in what proved to be his final appearance in a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Heart of Midlothian) but was then forced to retire from playing due to a blood disorder which caused kidney problems, aged only 24. He continued to be associated with Hamilton Academical, coaching their supporters' team. Death and legacy In the early 1990s McNaught underwent a kidney transplant; however, having appeared to have been in good health he died in June 1997 at the age of 32. His funeral was attended by various figures connected to Partick Thistle and Hamilton Academical. He is buried at Bent Cemetery in Hamilton, where fellow footballers who passed at a young age (Davie Cooper two years earlier and Phil O'Donnell ten years later) are also interred. McNaught was nicknamed 'Worzel' in reference to a perceived resemblance to a popular children's character of the era (a scarecrow with unkempt fair hair). In 2004, he was voted by supporters as Hamilton Academical's all-time 'cult hero' ahead of Rikki Ferguson and David Wilson.

Early life and marriage Griffin was born in 1932 on Yerba Buena Ranch outside of Tucson, Arizona. Her parents were Thomas Francis Griffin and Beatriz Sandoval Griffin. She attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, Briarcliff College, and the University of Arizona, the latter where she studied drama. Griffin met Dominick Dunne in Hartford, Connecticut. They celebrated their marriage in 1954 at Griffin's family ranch in Arizona and lived in New York City before relocating to Beverly Hills. Of their five children, three survived infancy, including Dominique Dunne and Griffin Dunne. The couple divorced in 1965. Death of Dominique Dunne and founding of Justice for Homicide Victims The couple's daughter, actor Dominique Dunne, was murdered by ex-boyfriend John Sweeney at her home, in October 1982. He choked her and attempted to kill himself. Actor David Packer, with whom Dunne was rehearsing for the miniseries V, found Sweeney trying to resuscitate Dunne, before attempting to kill himself by overdosing on pills. Sweeney was arrested and Dunne was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was placed on life support immediately and never recovered. She was removed from life support by her parents on November 4, 1982. On September 21, 1983, Sweeney was acquitted of second-degree murder and instead, he was charged with voluntary manslaughter. Dunne's family protested the verdict as an \\"injustice.\\" One year later, Griffin Dunne and Marcella Leach founded California Center for Family Survivors of Homicide, a victim's rights group. Now known as Justice for Homicide Victims, the organization supports victims of homicide with legal support and navigation, counseling and referrals, and financial assistance. In 1989, Griffin Dunne was awarded the Crime Victims Award by Dick Thornburgh. Her work was also recognized by then-President George H. W. Bush at the White House. Later life Ellen Dunne suffered from multiple sclerosis starting in the early 1980s.

He is considered one of the pioneers of ferroelectric memory devices. He was elected to the Royal Society in 2008.  Biography  James Scott was born in Beverly, New Jersey. He attended high school in New Jersey and graduated from Harvard University in 1963. After receiving his doctorate in physics from Ohio State University (1966) in the field of high resolution molecular spectroscopy, he worked for six years in the Quantum Electronics Research Laboratory at Bell Laboratories, New Jersey. In 1972 he was appointed professor of physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where he established a research program investigating ferroelectrics using laser spectroscopy. It was here that began his groundbreaking work on \\"integrated ferroelectrics\\" -- semiconductor chips that incorporate thin ferroelectric memory devices. In 1984 he co-founded Symetrix Corporation to develop ferroelectric RAM (FRAM), which licensed its technology to Matsushita. There followed appointments as Dean at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (1992) and the University of New South Wales (1995). In 1997, he worked as a visiting professor in Yokohama thanks to an award from Sony and in Germany after receiving a Humboldt Research Award. In 1999, when he left Symetrix, he became professor of ferroics at the University of Cambridge where his research focused on multiferoed magnetoelectrics and nanometric methods. From 2015 he was a joint professor in both chemistry and physics at the University of St Andrews. James Scott died on 6 April 2020, leaving a wife and three children. As his only son, Michael Christopher Scott, at ground-zero in the late 1970s, I hated him. I wanted him dead for the last 40 years, especially after he beat up my mother. While completely brilliant, JFS was tragically flawed. He grew up poor, and never forgot what that felt like. Whatever inner demons drove him to these accomplishments, they're done with this poor man.  Awards  He was awarded the Materials Research Society gold medal in 2008 and Slovenia's Jo≈æef Stefan gold medal in 2009. He was a member of the American Physical Society from 1974, a Fellow of the Royal Society from 2008, and a member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 2011. In 2014 he was listed by Thomson Reuters as among the most highly cited physicists. In 2016 he was awarded the UNESCO medal for contributions to nanoscience and nanotechnology.

The park extends along the northern and eastern borders of the neighborhood, following the Allegheny River and Negley Run. The Park Highland Park encompasses the northern region of the neighborhood. Its main entrance is clearly marked by two bronze sculptures by Giuseppe Moretti atop Ionic columns on each side of the Highland Avenue. Its Stanton Avenue entrance features another Moretti pair of sculptures on grand pedestals, depicting two groups of lean, heroic youths taming wild horses. The park, which contains two of the city's large water reservoirs, offers picnic groves, a Babbling Brook water feature, Lake Carnegie for fishing, the city's only long-course swimming pool, four sand volleyball courts, tennis courts, walking trails, and two children's playgrounds (Farmhouse Park and the \\"Super Playground\\"). The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium are also within the park, as is the Washington Boulevard Bike Track, a banked half-mile oval loop for bicyclists. The park was founded in 1889, and opened in 1893 after Pittsburgh Director of Public Works, Edward Bigelow, spent more than $900,000 in city funds to buy the land, parcel by parcel, from farmers. In 1898, Bigelow's cousin Christopher Lyman Magee created the Pittsburgh Zoo as an attraction to encourage customers to ride streetcar lines which Magee owned and which ran from East Liberty to Highland Park. A 190-year-old farmhouse, which has been used as a park office and summer campsite, still stands within the park near the \\"Farmhouse Park\\" children's playground.

At the 2018 X Games, she already had the high score when she decided to try and up her score to win the gold. Zeuner is among the 16 members of the inaugural U.S.A Skateboarding National Team announced in March 2019. Zeuner will compete to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in the Women's Park division.  Early life  Brighton Zeuner is from San Diego, California. Her father and her brother Jackson got her into skateboarding when her father returned to the hobby and wanted Jackson to come along as well. She would practice at home until she got her own skateboard. Her brother wanted a vert ramp so the parents got a vert ramp for the kids which helped Brighton a lot to progress fast at a very young age. She soon became a better skateboarder than her brother and started to love competing. Being a teenager while being an elite athlete means Zeuner has to balance schoolwork with her competition. She has found a school that gives her flexibility as she tries to reach her goals in skateboarding. \\"It‚Äôs five times a week, there‚Äôs a little homeschooling, but it's cool because the teachers understand when you have to go and why,\\" she said. \\"They try to get you caught up before you leave because there‚Äôs no such thing as doing work when you're at an event. They understand that.\\"  Career  In 2016, she began competing professionally. She joined the cast of the series Camp Woodward. The same year in August, she became the first ever Vans Park Series World Champion, just after breaking another history milestone as the youngest female athlete to ever compete at the X-Games with the age of 11. In 2017, she became the youngest gold medalist of all-time at X Games Minneapolis when she won Women's Skateboard Park the day after her 13th birthday. A year later, she became the youngest back-to-back gold medalist with another win at X Games Minneapolis 2018. She then was nominated for the ESPN's ESPY award for Best Female Action Sports Athlete but the award went to fellow nominee and Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim. Skateboarding will be a sport at the 2020 Summer Olympics. She is a potential gold medalist for Team USA.

The F5 was released in October 2017, whilst the F5 Youth was released in November 2017, under Oppo's F Series. The series began in January 2016, with the release of the Oppo F1, delivering succeeding smartphones on a 6-month time interval with alternative variants such as the F3 Plus and F5 Youth. These phones have a heavy emphasis on the capabilities of its front-facing camera. These phones are made to be the successors of the Oppo F3 and Oppo F3 Plus, released in May 2017 and April 2017, respectively. Now, the F5 and F5 Youth have become the predecessors to the Oppo F7 and Oppo F7 Youth, as the company continues their production and development of the F series.  Specifications   Hardware  The Oppo F5 and Oppo F5 Youth possess similar specifications in terms of their hardware. Both phones are touchscreen operated, measured at 156.5 x 76 x 7.5 mm, and weigh 152 grams. These are both lighter than their predecessor, the Oppo F3, which weighs 153 grams. The Oppo F5 has a plastic backing, whilst the F5 Youth uses an aluminium back. Both of the front panels are LCD glass touchscreens that use Corning's Gorilla Glass 5. Their technology is both capable of running on GSM (2G), HSPA (3G), and LTE (4G) networks. The phones are also equipped with internal GPS, Bluetooth 4.2, and supports dual-SIM functions, just as its predecessors, the Oppo F3 and F3 Plus, did. Both the F5 and F5 Youth comes with a 3200mAh battery, which remain unchanged from the F3. Despite not changing the battery size, users and critics have said that Oppo have successfully optimized the power consumption of the phones, as there has been a significant increase in screen-on time. Oppo has continued to keep the batteries on the series non-removable. These phones both have 6-inch screens, with a FHD+ touchscreen with a screen resolution of 1080 x 2160 pixels in an 18:9 aspect ratio. These screens both support multi-touch. This is an incremental change from the F3, which had a 1080 x 1920 5.5 inch display in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The F5 and F5 Youth are powered by the same Octa-core 2.5GHz Cortex-A53 processor, and also the same Mali-G71 MP2 graphics card. The Oppo F5 offers either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, whilst the F5 Youth variant is available in either 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending on the country of purchase. The internal storage of both phones depends on their variant. The Oppo F5 4GB RAM comes with 32GB of internal storage, whilst the 6GB variant comes with 64GB internal storage. The Oppo F5 Youth is available with only 32GB of internal storage, regardless of model. Both phones have an expandable microSD slot, which can be expanded to 256GB. The camera on these phones differ, as the F5 rear camera has 16MP with features such as LED flash, HDR, panorama, and 1080p/30fps recording capability. Its front-facing camera, which is strongly marketed by Oppo, has a 20MP lens. The F5 Youth shares similar specifications to the F3, as they both carry 13MP rear cameras, which are capable of LED Flash, HDR, panorama, and 1080p/30fps recording capability. Their front-facing cameras shoot at 16MP. Both the F5 and F5 Youth support the 3.5mm headphone jack, and also have a loudspeaker located on the bottom of the phones, next to its microUSB 2.0 On-The-Go charging port. Oppo has kept the main sensors found in the F3 and F3 Plus: the accelerometer, proximity sensor, light sensor, and magnetometer. They have decided to move the fingerprint sensor from the front of the phone to the back on both the F5 and F5 Youth.  Software  The Oppo F5 and F5 Youth's operating system by default is Android 7.1 (Nougat), but may vary to 7.1.1, depending on the variant distributed per region. The OS of these phones can be further updated until the phone is no longer supported by the latest Android version. Both phones shipped with ColorOS 3.2, which is based on Android 7.1.1, whilst the F3 and F3 Plus ran on ColorOS Android 6.0.  Reception  GSM Arena have provided a very detailed review of the qualities which they liked and disliked about the Oppo F5. They have categorized the phone to be 'trendy', as it possessed the main features that most modern 2017 phones would have, such as trimmed bezels, face unlock, and ultra-wide aspect ratios. The reviewer found the display of the phone to have excellent color contrast along with sharp and precise images because of its 402ppi density. GSM Arena have tested the battery life of the phone and gave a 91-hour endurance rating when they conducted their daily tests and was described to be a good score based on their standards. Overall, GSM Arena have recommended the phone as a whole, but they believed it should have been priced better as a mid-range tier phone. GSM Arena did not provide their own review for the Oppo F5 Youth. Andrew Williams from Trusted Reviews discussed his opinions about the Oppo F5 on 19 December 2017. He praised the phones' widescreen with thin bezels, which are uncommonly found on a mid-tier phone. In terms of performance, Williams finds that the phone ran decently, but struggled to compete with the processors of its competition. He said that it did however possess decent frame rates to play games and navigate through the phone smoothly without many issues. The front-facing camera is highly applauded by Williams, as it was able to capture detailed and accurate selfies. However the rear camera did not receive the same positive feedback, as he mentioned that it was heavily dependent on the lighting of the scenery, but was capable of capturing detail-rich images occasionally. The reviewer also states that the battery life of the phone was not an issue, however it did not last long enough to become one of its strengths. Williams concluded that the phone would be a solid choice as a budget Android operating phone, especially for those who enjoy taking selfies. The Oppo F5 was also reviewed by Abhishek Baxi from Android Authority on 26 August 2018 in an article titled \\"Great selfies come at a premium\\". After spending two weeks with the phone, Baxi wrote that the phone did not fit well with its 'selfie expert' claim. According to the review, the phone's overall performance was enough to satisfy most people, but wrote that there were better and cheaper alternatives in the market. Baxi criticized the phone's plastic covered back and heavy weight, but commended the ergonomic build of the phone, noting the rounded edges and the ease of single-handed use. He claimed that the display had great viewing angles, showing clear and crisp color accuracy, despite being under direct sunlight. Baxi said that processor and chipset of the phone performed decently \\"if you don't stretch it too much\\". Again, the micro USB charging port has been criticized by the reviewer, as it did not support fast charging. His review of the camera has also claimed that it was heavily dependent on the lighting, as there is a noticeable quality drop in low lighting conditions, but is more than capable of taking high-quality images. In a heavily positive review, the Oppo F5 Youth was reviewed by Criss Galit from Gadget Pilipinas. Galit labelled the phone as \\"Great Value for Less\\". Galit started off by complementing the generous screen to body ratio and adds on to this by saying that \\"it doesn't feel like you're holding a 6-inch smartphone\\", as it feels comfortable when holding this in use. The reviewer describes the display of this phone as crisp, vibrant, and color accurate, even when placed under direct sunlight. He writes that the quality of the phone's audio is loud and crisp, with a present bass, but can sound slightly affected when playing at full volume. Galit applauded the operating system of the phone, as it is simple, clean, and pleasant to the eyes. Both the front-facing and rear camera are heavily commended by the reviewer, as they are capable of capturing sharp and accurate images with \\"true-to-life\\" color reproduction, even under low light conditions. The chipset of the phone was also praised by Galit, as it was powerful enough to run high-end games smoothly. He also briefly added that the battery life of this phone was not an issue, as one full charge was sufficient enough for a full day's use. Galit had come to the verdict that the Oppo F5 Youth was simply a more affordable version of the F5, as they possess very similar specifications, but was significantly cheaper for the performance it delivers.  Issues   Battery  One of the main concerns with the battery on the Oppo F5 was that the phone did not support any type of fast charging, as it continued to use the older micro USB port.  Performance  Given that both phones were considered as mid-tier phones, their hardware and specifications would take some cutbacks, as their chipsets struggled to run the latest demanding high-end games. Moreover, the Oppo F5 Youth heated up quickly when attempting to run powerful applications.  Availability  Oppo has created two variants of the Oppo F5 and Oppo F5 Youth. The Oppo F5 can come with either 4GB RAM with 32GB of internal storage, or 6GB RAM with 64GB of internal storage. The Oppo F5 Youth offers either 3GB RAM of 4GB RAM, both with 32GB of internal storage. The Oppo F5 comes in 3 different color options, black, red, or gold. The Oppo F5 Youth offers 2 color choices, which are black or gold. Oppo has announced that they will be selling the Oppo F5 in the Philippines, India, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Nepal. The Oppo F5 was unveiled in the Philippines on 27 October 2017, putting the phone available for pre-ordering until 3 November 2017. Its official release began on 4 November 2017 onwards, with a starting price of 15,990 PHP. The market in India had launched the 4GB variant Oppo F5 on 2 November 2017, with a starting price of 19,990 INR. Likewise, Malaysia has also released the phone on 2 November 2017, at 1,298 MYR, and later released the 6GB variant of the Oppo F5 on 6 December 2017, available for pre-ordering at 1,698MYR. Other countries that have also released this phone placed its initial pricing at similar ranges as Pakistan's, whose started at 39,999 PKR, while Nepal's had settled at 33,990NPR. Russia, in particular, have launched the Oppo F5 slightly later, on 10 November 2017.

Political career During the Milo≈°eviƒá administration Jovanoviƒá led the local organization of the Serbian Renewal Movement (Srpski pokret obnove, SPO) in Ni≈° during the 1990s and was a prominent opponent of Milo≈°eviƒá. The SPO participated in the 1996 local elections as part of the Zajedno (Together) coalition of opposition parties. When the first official returns showed that Zajedno had been defeated in Ni≈° (as well as Belgrade and other major cities), several opposition figures charged electoral fraud and organized what became a series of major protests throughout the country. Jovanoviƒá was a leader of the protests in Ni≈° and urged opposition supporters to remain peaceful, charging that the Milo≈°eviƒá government was seeking a pretext for a crackdown.\\"OPPOSITION LEADERS IN NIS CALL FOR RESIGNATION OF PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring Service: Central Europe & Balkans, 10 December 1996 (Source: Beta news agency, Belgrade, in Serbo-Croat 1900 gmt 8 Dec 96).

The Socialist Party of Serbia and its allies won this election, and the Zajedno members served in opposition. Jovanoviƒá appears to have resigned from the federal assembly once he received an executive position in the local government of Ni≈°. Jovanoviƒá served on Ni≈°'s electoral commission during the 1997 Serbian parliamentary election and expressed concerns about the transparency of the election to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitoring mission.\\"Opposition party SPO raises objections to procedures in Nis,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring Service: Central Europe & Balkans, 23 September 1997 (Source: Beta news agency, Belgrade, in Serbo-Croat 1229 gmt 21 Sep 97).

While several local alliances between the DS and SPO fell apart soon after the 1996 elections (most notably in Belgrade), ≈Ωivkoviƒá and Jovanoviƒá generally kept their alliance against the Milo≈°eviƒá administration intact until 2000. In June of that year, they led a sit-in demonstration in support of eleven opposition activists and journalists who had been detained at a demonstration.Dragan Stankovic, \\"Serbian town mayor stages sit-in over detentions,\\" Reuters News, 28 June 2000. The 2000 Yugoslavian general election was a watershed moment in Serbian political history, bringing about the fall of the Milo≈°eviƒá administration and a victory for the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) alliance.

The driver and 22 internees were killed and 72 soldiers were injured, some seriously. The Swiss section was transferred as a result of a merger on 1 January 1872 to the Western Swiss Railways (Chemins de fer de la Suisse Occidentale, SO) on 28 June 1881 and to the Western Switzerland‚ÄìSimplon Company (Suisse-Occidentale‚ÄìSimplon, SOS) and on 1 January 1890 to the Jura‚ÄìSimplon Railway (Jura-Simplon-Bahn, JS). Due to the nationalisation of the JS on 1 May 1903, the Swiss part of the line was transferred to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), which has operated the line electrically at 15,000 V 16.7 Hz since 22 November 1942. Steam locomotives of the Soci√©t√© nationale des chemins de fer fran√ßais (SNCF) took over the operation of trains in Les Verri√®res for the time being. The French section of the line was nationalised along with the rest of the PLM on 1 January 1938 and integrated into the SNCF. To speed up the electrification of Les Verri√®res via Pontarlier to Dole, SNCF received financial support from Switzerland. The section from Les Verri√®res to Pontarlier has been equipped since 3 June 1956 with the Swiss power system of 15,000 V 16.7 Hz so that the Swiss traction can run through to Pontarlier. Electrical operations commenced with 25,000 V 50 Hz on the line from Pontarlier to Dole on 25 April 1958.  Route description Champ-du-Moulin station with Creux du Van in the background, around 1930 Elevation profile of the Neuch√¢tel‚ÄìPontarlier line Pontarlier station with Z2 railcar of TER Franche-Comt√© Trains travelling to the Val de Travers use the Jura Foot Railway running towards Yverdon as far as Auvernier. The line then runs through the vineyards up to B√¥le and provides a good view of Lake Neuch√¢tel. Continuing up the Areuse gorge, the line passes between rocks and over numerous bridges. Regional trains cross in Champ-du-Moulin station, where it is possible to see the famous Creux du Van. The line continues via Noiraigue to Travers, where most of the trains operated by Transports R√©gionaux Neuch√¢telois branch off on the line to Buttes. The line continues to Pontarlier, past the former stations of Couvet CFF, Boveresse and Les Bayards. All passenger trains pass through Les Verri√®res without stopping; the border station serves only goods traffic. The trains continue to Pontarlier on French soil, but still using the Swiss electrical system. The electrification changes in Pontarlier station from the Swiss to the French system.  Operations  Three RegioExpress services run each day on the Bern‚ÄìNeuch√¢tel‚ÄìFrasne route with stops in Neuch√¢tel and Pontarlier, connecting in Frasne with the TGV Lyria trains on the Lausanne‚ÄìDijon‚ÄìParis Gare de Lyon route. It is operated by SBB Regional using RBDe 562 sets. In 2018, Regio services, operated in collaboration with Transports R√©gionaux Neuch√¢telois (TRN), ran every 30 minutes on the Neuch√¢tel‚ÄìTravers section, continuing over the R√©gional du Val- de-Travers line to Fleurier and Buttes. During peak hours, additional services run, using TRN RABe 527 sets and SBB Domino trains. The Les Verri√®res‚ÄìPontarlier section is the only line that is operated by the French infrastructure manager RFF that is electrified on the 15,000 V 16.7 Hz system. It is therefore used for test runs of multi-system rolling stock. As a result, the four-system Thalys high-speed sets and a variant of the Prima electric locomotive were tested on it under 16.7 Hz power when new.

He was first elected to the Virginia Senate (a part-time position) in 1967, representing Norfolk City and the Northwestern part of the city of Virginia Beach, then known as District 2. He succeeded fellow Democrat Robert F. Baldwin, who had represented the district since 1962. In 1971, a federal court order consolidated three Norfolk and Virginia Beach senatorial districts into one three-member district, and the legislature also reorganized districts based on the 1970 census results.

E-AB sensors are advantageous over previously reported aptamer- based sensors, such as fluorescence generating aptamers, due to their ability to detect target binding in vivo with real-time measurements. An E-AB sensor is composed of a three-electrode cell: an interrogating electrode, a reference electrode, and a counter electrode. A signal is generated within the electrochemical cell then measured and analyzed by a potentiostat. There are several biochemical and electrochemical parameters to optimize signal gain for E-AB biosensors. The density packing of DNA or RNA aptamers, the ACV frequency administered by the potentiostat, and the chemistry of the SAM are all factors that determine signal gain as well as the signal to noise ratio of target binding. E-AB biosensors provide a promising mechanism for in-situ sensing and feedback-controlled drug administration. Left: This image displays the electrode surface upon which the aptamer is immobilized and the self assembling monolayer (SAM) passivates the surface where aptamers are not bound. The redox reporter (blue) is far away from the gold electrode on the unfolded (or partially unfolded) DNA in the absence of target molecule (purple). Upon target binding, the DNA changes structure by folding, bringing the redox reporter closer to the electrode surface. Right: The change in current produces a signal relative to the baseline. The baseline signal is the signal generated without target. The baseline represents the redox activity of the aptamer vs. Ag/AgCl.  Signal generation  The DNA or RNA aptamers are fixed on the interrogating electrode, where a redox reaction is reported by a redox tag. Gold is often used as the probe surface for interrogating electrodes. The surface of the gold electrode is packed with redox-tagged DNA or RNA aptamers. The redox reporter is often methylene blue. Upon target binding, the aptamer changes structure by folding, bringing the redox reporter closer to the gold electrode. This increase in proximity from the redox- reporter to the electrode enables faster electron transfer from the redox tag to the gold electrode. The increase in speed of electron transfer contributes to a change in Faradaic current that is detected by the potentiostat. The reference electrode is the site of a known chemical reaction that has a known redox potential. For example, a reference electrode that harbors the reaction of silver-silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) has a fixed redox potential and is the measuring point for the redox potential of the interrogating electrode. The counter electrode (or auxiliary electrode) acts as a cathode or anode to the interrogating electrode. The applied voltage is not passed through the reference electrode due to an impedance supplied by the potentiostat. Therefore, the potential generated within the electrochemical cell is attributed to the interrogating electrode. Current is measured as potential of the interrogating electrode vs. the fixed potential of the reference electrode. The difference in potential is what produces the current in the external circuit and generates a signal. The signal quantifies target binding depending on electron transfer that is stoichimetrically proportional to target binding.  Signal optimization  There are several parameters to consider for optimization of binding-induced electrochemical signal gain. The aptamer probe packing density, the nature of the self-assembling monolayer, and the ACV frequency are factors that affect detecting and measuring of signal. Two main factors are considered when fabricating the packing density on the probe surface. The concentration of aptamer and the surface chemistry of the self-assembling monolayer (SAM) enable variations of desired probe packing density.  Aptamer packing density  The density of aptamer packing on the electrode surface is an important parameter to optimize signal. Depending on the size and nature of target molecule, different aptamer packing densities favor signal gain. Studies have shown that small target molecules enable a greater signal gain for low density aptamer packing, while larger proteins as a target generate the greatest signal at intermediate probe packing densities. Signal gain decreases as packing density increase above the range of optimal signal gain due to steric hindrance. When the probe surface neighboring an aptamer is blocked by an adjacent aptamer, the redox tag on the target-bound aptamer will not have room to come into contact with the electrode, therefore failing to report target binding. The concentration of aptamer in solution that incubates a clean probe is found to be proportional to the density of aptamers that are immobilized on the probe. Studies have reported suggesting that small targets such as cocaine E-AB sensors generate the most signal with the lowest probe packing density. Conversely, larger protein targets such as the protein Thrombin generate the most signal at intermediate probe packing densities.  SAM nature and surface chemistry  Consecutively, the probe is incubated in a SAM to make the surface of the probe that is unoccupied unreactive to target or further aptamer binding. The optimized SAM thickness is thick enough for the surface to be passivated against target binding and thin enough to transfer electrons from the redox reporter to the electrode. SAM thickness can be measured as length. It has been reported that cocaine E-AB sensors generate more signal when the SAM is thinner and therefore more conductive. However, reducing the SAM from 6 carbons to 2 carbons decreases signal, and peak current is generated using a 6-carbon SAM.  ACV frequency  The ACV frequency is used to monitor the Faradaic current, which quantifies target binding. The generation of signal has been reported to be insensitive to ACV frequency as long as the ACV is in a sensible range, therefore, not too low to be detected or too fast. The ACV frequency is used instead of a single-directional current to protect the degradation of the electrodes. Square wave voltammetry is applied and measured to analyze the change in current as the voltage is swept linearly across an electrode.  Aptamer generation  Design and fabrication of E-AB aptamers is consistent with methods used for previously reported aptamers. SELEX is a well known selection method for fabrication and selection of nucleotide aptamers. SELEX is relatively limited by the amount of enrichment that can be achieved in a single round. A less-reported screening method for aptamer fabrication that overcomes this limitation is affinity-based library enrichment that has been termed Particle Display.  Particle Display  Particle Display produces higher yields of higher affinity aptamers in less rounds than conventional selection methods. In this method, libraries of aptamers are separated into aptamer particles and separated by FACS based on affinity. Only the highest affinity aptamer particles are isolated and sequenced into aptamers. This is an affinity-base selection process that is more efficient than selection methods such as SELEX. Particle display may be a reliable aptamer generation method for E-AB sensors due to the high affinity and specificity of target binding.  Promising applications  E-AB biosensors as basis for controlled drug delivery. Feedback-controlled drug delivery for continuous drug administration with dosage levels based on integrating E-AB signal calculations into a drug administering medical device. E-AB biosensors do not require reagents, are inexpensive compared to antibody detection methods, can be used in blood or other fluids with high abundance of non- target molecules, and they are reusable. These are all factors that make E-AB biosensors a promising method for feedback-controlled drug delivery dependent on integrated calculations of computer programming.

The German translation of the term, Schreibtischt√§ter, was listed as one of the 100 most significant words in the German language in the 20th century and dates from around the same time as the English version. In the early 1970s the word Schreibtischt√§ter was included in the German standard dictionary, the Duden. History The planning of the Holocaust, the genocide of the Jews, had one of its key points at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942. Only two of the participants actually took part in any killings. The other participants were involved in the planning and organisation of the Holocaust. This second group of officials was later classified as \\"desk murderers\\"; of this group, Adolf Eichmann was seen as the prototype of a desk murderer. Despite his designation as a desk murderer, Eichmann did leave his desk and office and traveled to extermination camps such as Sobibor, Auschwitz and Treblinka, becoming actively involved and knowing exactly what went on there. For this reason, some modern historians such as Bettina Stangneth dispute that Eichmann was a desk murderer, as he took too active an interest in the process of the Holocaust. Maurice Papon, responsible for the deportation of Jews from France during the German occupation, was, like Eichmann, seen as a stereotypical desk murderer and, like Eichmann, long escaped justice. Heinrich M√ºller, chief of the Gestapo and Eichmann's superior, described by British historian Robert S. Wistrich as somebody who made mass murder into an administrative task, was another high-ranking desk murderer during World War II. Hannah Arendt, who reported on Eichmann's trial for The New Yorker, published Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1963, a book sometimes falsely credited with being the source of the term \\"desk murderer\\". In this book she described him and his associates as the \\"modern, state-employed mass murderers\\" and talks of the \\"bureaucracy of murder\\". She first used the term \\"desk murderer\\" in early 1965 but this was not translated into German at the time and she herself did not use Schreibtischt√§ter in any of her German language publications. She used the term \\"desk murderer\\" in an English introduction to the report by German journalist on the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials in 1966 and, from there, it was translated to the German Schreibtischt√§ter. The German origin of \\"desk murder\\" dates from 1964, when the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung used the term for the first time. Criminal responsibility Under West German criminal law, a distinction is made between those who order murder and those who commit murder on their own initiative. Desk murderers who pass on orders from above would therefore be guilty only as accomplices to murder, but if they ordered any murders, they would be fully liable for them even if someone else carried them out. Some people, including lawyer Jan Schl√∂ss, have recommended reducing the scope of the term \\"desk murderer\\" to those who directly ordered murders. Others use the term to refer to anyone who was part of the bureaucracy engaged with carrying out criminal orders, no matter how indirect their involvement. Other use The term \\"desk murderer\\" has also been used in non-Holocaust contexts, such as during the Auschwitz trial when the defence lawyer Hans Laternser demanded the arrest of witness , an Auschwitz survivor and East German politician, for his alleged role in approving the killings of refugees attempting to escape East Germany on the Berlin Wall. The book ‚ÄòI YOU WE THEM - Journeys Beyond Evil: The Desk Killers in History and Today‚Äô, by Dan Gretton, is a layered investigation into the phenomenon of the ‚ÄòSchreibtischt√§ter‚Äô. 'I You We Them' focuses beyond the intentionality of murder and examines the more complicated, and politically urgent, question of distanced killing, of how organisations and the individuals within them have been able to ‚Äòcompartmentalise‚Äô, to evade responsibility for their actions - whether in the rigid bureaucracies of the Third Reich or within the complex structures of corporations today. By foregrounding the role of white-collar perpetrators in the Holocaust and other historical genocides, and by highlighting the collaboration between corporations and the state in history and today, it raises urgent questions about the meaning of responsibility and the deeply problematic nature of contemporary corporate behaviour. In his book, Gretton notes that: ‚ÄúIn the early stages of this research I used the term ‚Äòdesk murderer‚Äô. However, it soon became apparent that many of the individuals who kill from their desks do not have the criminal intent to do so, therefore ‚Äòdesk killer‚Äô is a more accurate term, Desk murderers do exist, but, thankfully, are very few. On the other hand, desk killers are all around us.\\"Extract from 'I You We Them: Journeys Beyond Evil' by Dan Gretton German far-right politician Gerhard Frey used the term Schreibtischt√§ter for people supporting Israel, as, in his view, they thereby became accomplices in \\"crimes committed there\\".

He represented NSW City in the City vs Country Origin match in 1989. Biography Career From 1985 to 1991, Chisholm made 115 first-grade appearances for South Sydney, six of them in finals, including the 1989 preliminary final loss to Canberra, in which he scored two tries. He played mostly in the second-row and occasionally as a lock. His time at South Sydney included a 10-game suspension in 1991 for tackling a referee. The incident occurred when Chisholm was trying to prevent a try from Newcastle winger John Schuster, claiming that tunnel vision had meant he hadn't seen referee Geoff Weeks. This version was dismissed by the judiciary, which concluded that Chisholm \\"must have seen the referee\\" and that the act was both deliberate and reckless. In 1992 he spent a season with North Sydney, where he featured in only two first-grade games, but did play in the club's reserves premiership team. Family Chisholm's elder brother, Rick, was a halfback for Manly and Newtown during the 1980s.

Circular trading occurs when identical sell orders are entered at the same time with the same number of shares and the same price. As a result, there is no beneficial change in ownership of shares, but there is the appearance of an increased trade volume. Circular trading can be achieved by several parties colluding to achieve the fraudulent outcome. This is not to be confused with wash trading, which is where the same outcome is achieved but occurs through the actions of one investor, rather than a group. Circular trading is based on the premise that trading volume has a direct impact on share price.2\\\\. Investopedia. (2017). How Can Trading Volume Exceed Shares Outstanding?. Available: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/sharestradedoutstanding.asp. Last accessed 15 October 2018. Trading volume increases are widely regarded as a signal that something important is happening within a company, such as a new product or a change in management that may be soon announced.Sharma, R. (2014). Circular Trading in Stock Market. Available: http://www.blog.sanasecurities.com/circular-trading-stock-market/. Last accessed 10 September 2018. Due to this, investors buy shares in order to take advantage of the expected increase in share value. This increases the value of the shares, causing them to become overvalued. Circular trading is fraudulent because the signal that investors receive to buy shares has no basis in reality and is made with the sole purpose of creating interest where none is warranted. Therefore, this fraudulent practice is widely considered unethical and is banned in many countries. This issue is most prevalent in India, where companies such as Videocon Industries Ltd had their shares devalued fraudulently by the brokers Mansukh Securities and Finance Ltd. and Intec Shares and Stock Brokers Ltd. Circular trading has become a particularly important issue since the advent of high-frequency trading in the 1990s, which allows large investors and investor groups to perform an extremely high number of automated transactions in a short period of time.Investopedia. (2018). What is high-frequency trading? Available: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/high-frequency-trading.asp. Last accessed 15 October 2018. Powerful computers can be used to buy and sell shares in single stocks at immensely more rapid rates than humans can achieve manually. Consequently, creating the appearance of high trading volumes has become much easier, particularly in large companies where a very large number of transactions is required to simulate a realistic level of activity.  Market consequences  In the most common form of circular tradinghttp://www.blog.sanasecurities.com/circular-trading-stock-market/, groups of investors fraudulently inflate the share price Share_priceof a company, then sell the sharesShare_(finance) they own for a profit. While this is illegal, the market consequences are usually minimal. Franke, M., Hoser, B., Schroder, J. (2009). On the Analysis of Irregular Stock Market Trading Behavior. Available: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78246-9_42 Less frequently, circular trading is used to directly impact a company's success or failure. In some cases, shareholdersShareholder set thresholds for the price of shares at which they will stay invested within a company or leave it or set a price threshold at which they will decide to purchase more shares. Shareholders tend to follow the decisions of those around them; consequently, the departure of a small number of influential shareholders may pose a risk to the overall health of the company. When these thresholds have become reasonably well defined, circular traders may manipulate the stock prices to always stay on the side of the price threshold which is in their best interests, regardless of the real value of the shares. Circular trading can also have severe market consequences in relation to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). A significant factor in the success of an IPO is the level of buzz and hype surrounding it. Efforts to fraudulently manipulate that level of excitement may cause companies to become significantly overvalued. As a result, companies which initially appear to be full of potential become over- hyped and inevitably find themselves with demands and expectations which they cannot fulfill; consequently, initial investors lose their investment when the company fails, and confidence in the stock market, in general, is weakened. Beyond the broad-reaching market consequences, the consequences for private individuals who invest in the stock markets are also significant. Individuals may spend more money on shares than they are worth. Regardless of whether they make a profit on the shares in the long term, their initial overpayment in purchasing the shares remains a detriment. When instances of circular trading are discovered, changes in consumer confidence often spread through the entirety of the stock market, and public trust in the stock markets as a whole is eroded.Investopedia. (2018). Understanding the Consumer Confidence Index. Available: https://www.investopedia.com/insights/understanding-consumer- confidence-index/. Last accessed 15 October 2018.  Examples  Circular trading has been most prevalent in India, with the majority of high-profile cases originating in the Indian stock market. The first case to receive public attention was that of Ketan Parekh, a stockbroker who was found guilty of a major stock market scam dating back to 1999. This was largely based on circular trading, although insider trading was also a significant component.Pannu, S. (2012). Stockbroker Ketan Parekh in major stock market scam, reveals IB report. Available: https://www.indiatoday.in/business/market/story/stockbroker-ketan-parekh- major-stock-market-scam-ib-report-108321-2012-07-07. Last accessed 10 September 2018. There were seven companies acting in union to illegally manipulate the market. They illegally bought shares in companies leading up to the date of their IPO's, effectively driving the share value up, before offloading the shares directly after the IPO, artificially inflating a company's value so as to mislead investors about the value and popularity of particular IPOs. When the scam was discovered, Parekh was barred from acting within the Indian stock exchange until the year 2017. The case of Parekh has gained notoriety because he was found violating the ban on his involvement in the Indian Stock Exchange. A 2012 report found that Parekh was not only still active in the Indian Stock Exchange, but he was also continually engaging in serious violations of the law, including insider trading and circular trading. In April 2012, Parekh colluded with his Singapore-based associate Akshay Natra, executing several synchronised trades in the shares of Nifty Bank. Through this use of circular trading, these individuals gained an illegitimate profit of approximately 10,000,000 Indian Rupees. Another case occurred in 2001 when the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) discovered that Angel Broking had been creating artificial trade volume in the shares of Sun Infoways Ltd for a period of approximately one month between February and March of that year. Angel Broking worked with three lesser-known brokerages to achieve this. The targeted shares were being traded between the prices of 296 and 342 Indian Rupees during the period the circular trading was active before dropping as low as 61 Indian Rupees in the following month when the publicly visible trading volume became legitimate. Another case that received public attention was the barring of Shankar Sharma in 2009 from the Indian Stock Exchange for a period of one year. Sharma was involved in circular trading through his position as Joint Managing Director of First Global Stock Broking Limited. Aside from that of Ketan Parekh, the most significant case of circular trading was when SEBI barred 16 people from trading on the Indian stock market for circular trading in 2010.Economic Times. (2010). SEBI bars 16 people from market for circular trading. Available: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/sebi-bars-16-people-from-market-for- circular-trading/articleshow/5603771.cms. Last accessed 10 September 2018. They were barred from buying, selling and dealing in securities on the market and had their bank accounts frozen. This was in response to proof that these individuals had created an artificially high volume in the market through synchronised trading among themselves. Numerous large companies that were well known in India were targeted‚ÄîMarvens Biotech, Rasi Electrodes, Sat Industries, KSL & Industries, Asian Star Co, Allcargo Global Logistics, Panoramic Universal, and Ushdev International. This case created a large scandal in India because the use of circular trading caused investors to lose faith in the accuracy of share prices on the Indian stock market, which affects many more companies than just those specifically targeted. Following this, in 2012, SEBI imposed a penalty of 200,000 Indian Rupees on the brokers involved.  Responses  Methods for preventing circular trading have been in development since the outbreak of high-profile cases in India, starting in 2010. In India, SEBI has begun using several methods aimed at preventing this fraudulent practice. This is done through increasing regulation on the stock market in a way that restricts trading high volumes of stocks in short amounts of time. One such method includes a price band, which is a range of prices which is set for a day, and specific stocks can only be sold within the price range on that day. As of 2018, SEBI has imposed a 10% price band for all stocks on the market. However, they can restrict genuine price movements that may occur in companies when important events occur, such as a change in management. Especially in the case of speculative companies, such as mining companies which experience a sharp spike in share price following a successful resource find, the price bands can severely dampen the genuine growth which is relied upon in these instances. As a result, SEBI has reportedly been considering varying the price bands based on industries and specific companies in order to avoid these issues. There are also inter-week price bands which restrict price movements over a week, with a larger variation of 25% being allowed in order to prevent large swings in price from having a direct impact for over more than one trading period. Margins have also been introduced, requiring that for each transaction that a broker orders, they must also deposit a small amount to the stock exchange. This is essentially a transaction charge that disincentivises brokers from placing orders unnecessarily. Without a transaction charge, groups could trade shares amongst themselves many times at no cost with no change in real ownership while still creating the appearance of trade volume. Although circular trading is still possible, it has a charge which cannot be avoided. In addition to these institutional measures which seek to make circular trading more difficult, there is also a field of academic research that is seeking ways to detect circular trading in a faster and more accurate manner than is currently possible. Although not the direct focus, the work of Palshikar et al. and Zhou et al. in 2008 and 2013 respectively has provided the basis for this in their research on the relationship between circular trading and trading networks, as well as early methods of detecting trader collusion. Palshikar, G.K. & Apte, M.M. (2008) Collusion set detection using graph clustering. Available: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-007-0076-8 Zhi-Qiang Jiang, Wen-Jie Xie, Xiong Xiong, Wei Zhang, Yong-Jie Zhang & Wei-Xing Zhou (2013) Trading networks, abnormal motifs and stock manipulation,Quantitative Finance Letters. Available: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21649502.2013.802877 In 2018, Ramin Salahshoor published a paper demonstrating success in detecting circular trading using a network-based approach, based on data from the Iran Mercantile Exchange.Salahshoor, R. (2018). A Novel Approach for Circular Trade Detection in Mercantile Exchange. Available: https://geistscience.com/papers/view/JFER1803103. Last accessed 29 October 2018. This was achieved by constructing networks of daily trades by several separate traders, then analysing trade cycles of various lengths from these networks. Salahshoor was able to group traders from each day into groups of traders who were engaged in suspicious cycles that were indicators of circular trading and traders who were acting legitimately. This was possible because of the nature of herding in stock markets. Salahshoor noted that when the circular traders inflated the share price, they were effectively herding a larger number of legitimate investors into also buying these shares. By analysing which investors were commonly the instigators of this herd mentality, Salahshoor was able to identify which traders were acting illegitimately. Salahshoor also factored in price fluctuations over time so that randomly generated suspicious cycles were eliminated from the analysis. Prior to this breakthrough, circular trading was only detectable through initial guesswork and intuition based on discrepancies between the level of trade volume recorded and what should be expected, as well as rapid changes in trade volume that did not have any obvious cause in the real-world situation. Salahshoor's method has had success in identifying circular traders in Iran. Further research in this area may lead to methods that will allow for the increasingly swift and accurate identification of circular traders in various types of markets. This is particularly important, considering that circular traders are only ever brought to justice after significant market damage has already occurred.

During the speech, Donald Trump argued the future of Western freedom was at stake and called to defend Western civilization against the threats of \\"terrorism and extremism.\\"  Background  Polish President Andrzej Duda invited Donald Trump to visit months ago before the event. Trump was to attend the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit and planned a visit to Poland ahead of it. He and the First Lady Melania Trump arrived at Warsaw Chopin Airport on July 5, 2017, and the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister Witold Waszczykowski greeted them. On the next day, Trump met with the president of Poland Andrzej Duda and the president of Croatia Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic. At the same time, he participated at the second summit of the Three Seas Initiative in Warsaw, Poland. On June 29, 2017, General H.R. McMaster explained Trump's upcoming trip to Poland with several objectives. In his statement, the visit in Poland was going to strengthen American alliances, demonstrate the United States and Europe's commitment to liberty and the rule of law, reinforce the common understanding of threats, respond to Russia's destabilizing activity, expand economic opportunity on the energy market, and address the environmental issue. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the PiS political party foresaw Mr. Trump's visit to be a \\"new success\\" for the country. Trump was also expecting a warmer welcome in Warsaw, Poland due to the Poles' supports of his presidency.  Location  Warsaw Uprising Monument The event took place at Warsaw Uprising Monument at Krasinski Square, in Warsaw. The Warsaw Uprising Monument was dedicated to the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. While in Warsaw, Trump stayed at the Warsaw Marriott Hotel.  Preparation  Donald Trump was planned to stop in Poland before the G20 summit in Germany. Before the event, Poland set up a stage at the downtown Warsaw square for the event and deployed security in preparing for the U.S. president's visit. There were colorful posters on the streets to invite people to attend the event and hung signs showing traffic diversions that indicated the place where Trump would stay during his visit to Warsaw. Ruling politicians and pro-government activists also planned to bus in groups of people to attend the event for ensuring a warm welcome for Trump.  Contents and delivery   Energy trade deal  Donald Trump began his speech by proclaiming America's eagerness to consolidate the partnership with Poland. He called for stronger trade and commerce ties between the two countries and pledged to provide alternative energy to address Poland's reliance on a sole energy supplier. Trade between the United States and Poland has risen steadily over the past few years, and Trump's speech shows his commitment to continuing to push for economic progress between the two countries. Trump was signaling a move to reduce Poland's dependence on Russia since it had been importing Russian gas as a primary energy source. On June 7, the United States initiated an action to send Poland its first natural gas, which was said to be the turning point in Poland's efforts to end its reliance on Russian coal. So both the move and the speech directly challenged Russia's dominant position in the European gas markets while announcing the US economic alliance with Poland.  Remembrance and praise  Trump spoke highly of the spirit of the Polish for defending the freedom and independence of the country several times at the speech, notably the unity of Poles against the oppression of communism. He applauded the Poles' prevailing spiritual determination, and recalled the gather of the Poles in 1979 that created the famous chant: \\"We want God.\\" The incident was evoked by Pope John Paul II in his return to Poland when he gave the speech to more than a million Polish people that shook the position of the atheistic communists in Poland. The event created a series of solidarity movement until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  Concerns about terrorism  While communism no longer poses a threat to Western civilization, another radical ideology is still threatening the Western harmony, Trump said. Referring to the terrorist attacks on the United States and Europe, he declared the resolution to stop the spread of terrorism and extremism under the threat of \\"radical Islamic terror.\\" Ongoing wars in the Middle East have led to large numbers of refugee seeking asylum, and European countries were the primary recipients. Since the European Union members were required to accept the Quotas of Migrants to alleviate the burden of the main landing sites for the migrants, refugees were swarming into the member states (including Malta, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Portugal, Estonia, Cyprus, Netherlands, Slovenia, Germany, Belgium, France, Romania, Spain, Croatia, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Austria, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein) that later caused the refugee crisis. However, Poland, Hungary, and Czechia has refused to accept the refugee quotas and rarely admit any asylum-seekers. Jaroslaw Kaczy≈Ñski, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice party, had explained to the public that a part of asylum seekers may cause destruction to the safety and culture of the country. Trump, during his presidency, shares the same political views with the party, which Trump himself further endorsed the approach by encouraging the member states of the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) to demonstrate the belief in the future of the Western survival.  Concerns about Russia's activities  Trump also said the United States and Poland held mutual values and commitment against Russia's actions and destabilizing activities that supported the hostile regimes including Syria and Iran. The U.S. claimed to aim at ceasing the activities of Islamic State (IS) in Syria. On the other hand, Russia supported the Assad to secure its military influence in the region. There were also speculations suggested that Russia allied with Assad to safeguard the Iran‚ÄìIraq‚ÄìSyria pipeline, and remain control over the European gas market. The conflict thus drew the separated standpoint between the western countries and Russia as Trump demonstrated. Trump also incidentally spoke of \\"the steady creep of government bureaucracy\\" that \\"drains the vitality and wealth of the people.\\"  Stress on mutual defense  Trump also expressed his support of the Article 5, the collective defense commitment of the NATO. According to the collective defense-Article 5, an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies. Trump mentioned this to show the US would not tolerate any destruction on allied states, thus emphasized the tough stance.  Reception  On the day of the given speech, Trump received various responses from different media outlets. The Wall Street Journal remarked, \\"Mr. Trump finally offered the core of what could become a governing philosophy. It is a determined and affirmative defense of the Western tradition.\\" The next day, Marc Thiessen from AEIdeas commented positively, \\"Donald Trump's speech in Warsaw's Krasinski Square was the best of his presidency, and one that any American could take pride in,\\" he said, \\"He needs more moments like this.\\" Jonathan Capehart, an editorial board member of The Washington Post had a more critical response, which he titled Trump's speech a \\"white-nationalist dog whistles.\\" David Smith from The Guardian regarded that \\"his attempt to set out a Trump doctrine will be remembered not for a quotable zinger but for muddled thinking and dark nativism.\\" He also noted that Trump's rare criticism of president of Russia Vladimir Putin was to \\"please Republican hawks at home.\\" Peter Beinart from The Atlantic critically commented on Trump's Western values, which the term only depicted the white and Christian rather than the essence of the nation: \\"Trump's sentence only makes sense as a statement of racial and religious paranoia.\\"  Audience  320x320px During the speech, the crowd at the square were chanting with the slogan of \\"DONALD TRUMP\\" that interrupted the speech several times (see video of the speech). However, there was opposition against Trump's arrival in Warsaw on that day. Polish women gathered together wearing the costume inspired by Margaret Atwood's 1985 feminist novel The Handmaid's Tale to protest Trump's sexism. They held up signs written with \\"DUMB TRUMP\\" to show opposition.  Former U.S. presidential visits to Poland  Donald Trump's arrival marked the eighth U.S. presidential visit to Poland. In May 1972, Richard Nixon became the first U.S. president to visit Poland. Nixon arrived at Warsaw to deliver a speech when Poland was still controlled by the Polish United Workers' Party. The visit paved the way for trade exchanges and U.S. loans for Poland. Gerald Ford visited Warsaw and Krakow in July 1975 to acknowledge the development of the U.S.-Poland relationship. Jimmy Carter visited Poland in 1977 on one of his first foreign trip as president. George H. W. Bush visited Poland in July 1989 to congratulate Poland overthrowing communists. In succession, Bill Clinton and Obama had made their visits to Poland.  Aftermath  In November 2017, the Polish state-owned energy company PGNiG signed a 5-year deal to import liquified natural gas (LNG) from the United States. In October 2018, the company further signed a long term deal to import up to 2 million tonnes of LNG from the United States annually over 20 years. The CEO of PGNiG Piotr Wozniak believed the deal is more beneficial than buying gas from Russia. President of Poland Andrzej Duda visited the White House to attend a joint press conference with Donald Trump in November 2018, and they discussed about a plan of establishing a U.S. military base in Poland. Poland also offered to contribute more than $2 billion to support this project.

Forty- five people, all men, were hanged by the neck until dead in Iowa between 1834 and 1963 for capital crimes including murder, rape, and robbery.Executions is the U.S. 1608-2002: The ESPY File Executions by State https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/ESPYstate.pdf The first time that Iowa abolished the death penalty was in 1872, as a result of anti-death penalty sentiment in the state, much of that due to Quaker, Unitarian and Universalist religious sentiment. By contrast, Presbyterians and Congregationalists advocated the retention of the death penalty, on biblical grounds. Anti-death penalty sentiment had been present in Iowa from its beginnings ‚Äì first territorial Governor of Iowa Territory, Robert Lucas, at his first message to the Iowa Territorial Assembly in November 1838, advocated that the death penalty be abolished. However, despite his advocacy, the Assembly passed legislation providing the death penalty for murder, to replace the existing legislation inherited from the Territory of Michigan providing for the same. In 1846, the Chief Justice of the Iowa Territorial Supreme Court, Charles Mason, founded the Iowa Anti-Capital Punishment and Prison Discipline Society, which campaigned for the death penalty to be abolished. The Society supported a bill in 1847 to replace the mandatory death penalty for murder with a discretionary death penalty (giving the jury the choice between death and life imprisonment); the bill passed the Senate but failed in the House. In 1851, both the House and Senate initially passed a new Criminal Code abolishing the death penalty; however, the intervention of a Presbyterian minister, Rev. Silas H. Hazzard, convinced the House to change its mind and reject the abolition, and after some disagreement the Senate relented and accepted the House's version of the Criminal Code with the death penalty still included. The Iowa Anti-Capital Punishment Society disbanded in 1851. The 1872 abolition was triggered by the case of George Stanley, who had been convicted of murder and sentenced to hang; Catholics and Quakers lobbied Governor Cyrus C. Carpenter to grant clemency. Carpenter expressed personal opposition to the death penalty, but said that it would be improper for him to grant clemency based on his personal feelings. Four days before Stanley's scheduled execution, both houses of the Iowa State Legislature passed resolutions requesting clemency, on the grounds that they planned to legislate the abolition of the death penalty; the Governor responded to this with a reprieve of execution. Following this, legislation to abolish the death penalty was passed by the House and presented to the Senate; in the Senate, it encountered difficulty, and was rejected twice before finally being passed. However, subsequent to the abolition there was an increasing incidence of lynching, which was widely blamed on the abolition, and lead to its reinstatement in 1878. Iowa was the first ever state to reinstate the death penalty having previously abolished it. The last execution to take place in Iowa was on March 15, 1963, at Iowa State Penitentiary, when Victor Harry Feguer was hanged for murder and kidnapping; however, Feguer's execution was under federal law; Feguer's execution was the last federal execution until Timothy McVeigh's in 2001. The last person to be executed in Iowa under Iowa state law was Charles A. Kelly on September 6, 1962. Iowa abolished the death penalty for a second time in 1965, with a bill signed by Governor Harold Hughes. Since then, there have been repeated attempts to reinstate the death penalty, but none have managed to pass both houses of the Iowa State Legislature. Then-Governor Terry Branstad made reinstatement of the death penalty a central focus of his 1994 re-election campaign; however, despite successfully being re-elected, he was unable to implement this policy due to opposition from Democrats in the Iowa State Senate. In 2006, a Des Moines Register poll found 66% of Iowa adults favored reinstating the death penalty, while 29% opposed it. While the death penalty is abolished at a state level in Iowa, the death penalty applies throughout the United States, including Iowa, under federal law. In 2005, a federal court in Sioux City handed down the first death sentence in Iowa since the 1960s, to Dustin Honken and Angela Johnson. Johnson's death sentence was overturned on appeal in 2012, and she was re-sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Honken was executed on July 17, 2020 at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, becoming the third death row inmate to be executed since the Trump administration's resumption of federal executions.

The word 'Banni' is specific to not only the buffaloes but as well as the pasture grass species which are native to this region. This breed of buffaloes is usually bred and preserved by a local community found in Kutch, called the 'Maldharis'. An average Banni buffalo yields around 12 to 18 litres of milk each day. The Banni buffalo has a different genetic makeup as compared to more common breeds, which allows for longer lactation periods, higher milk production potentials and also makes it disease resistant.Mishra, B., Singh, K., Chavan, D., Sadana, D., Kataria, R., Kathiravan, P., & Ahlawat, S.

The Banni buffalo is well-adapted to survive the extreme weather conditions such as water scarcity, frequent droughts, low humidity and high temperatures, unlike other commonly found buffaloes such as the ‚ÄòMurrah‚Äô and ‚ÄòJaffarabadi‚Äô. The Banni buffalo breed sustains itself in these harsh climatic conditions by consuming the naturally available grasses growing in this belt.

Banni buffaloes cover a grazing distance of 8 to 10 kilometres in Monsoon and up to 15 kilometres in the summer. In the last few decades, there has been an increase in Prosopis juliflora. Considered as an invasive weed in this region, prosopis juliflora has resulted in the decline of Kankrej cattle, which gave rise to Banni buffaloes who remained unaffected by it. Banni Buffalo were also able to adapt to the harsh water conditions. The Banni buffalo is bred according to the traditional practices of the Maldharis. They state that it's \\"the Banni grasslands and the Maldharis who can create the Banni buffalo\\".

The distance that can be covered by the herds range from 8-10 kilometres in Monsoon to 15 kilometres in Summer with the herd size ranging from 40-50 animals to 90-200 animals. The herds leave in the evening, and after the second milking, they return at dawn. Despite the magnitude of herds and the animals in them, the buffaloes rarely get lost or mixed with a different herd. This quality of night-grazing allows them to avoid harsh day temperatures and also accommodate temperature differences. This breed has a lactation length of 290-295 days with a lactation yield of 2500-2700 litres. Apart from this, the buffaloes are also known for their regular breeding and hardy nature.

In 2017 she took over the position of chair of the iD Dunedin Fashion Week organising committee.  Early life  Barton grew up in Dunedin, New Zealand. She learned how to use a sewing machine when she was 11 years old, and started to experiment with making garments, including outfits for her high school ball. She also modelled in department store fashion parades and for a modelling agency, and entered a Miss Otago contest in which she won third place. At the end of her second-to- last year of schooling her teachers recommended Barton study at secretarial college; Barton attended the college for only a week before returning to high school for her final year. On completing high school, Barton enrolled for a degree in home science at the University of Otago, although she withdrew after the first year.  Career  Barton moved to Auckland and worked briefly as a model at the June Dally Watkins Deportment School and Model Agency, owned by Maysie Bestall-Cohen. She then returned to Dunedin and worked for two years as a pattern-grader scaling patterns to different sizes at a clothing manufacturing company Sew Hoy and Sons. In 1981 Barton moved to Sydney, Australia. As pattern-grading was moving to a computer-based process, she decided to train as a designer at Sydney fashion school The Dress Design Studio, known today as the Fashion Design Studio. During the course, her hat designs were noticed by Patricia Merk from Dolly magazine and Merk hired her to design hats for the magazine's fashion shoots. On completion of her studies, Barton worked as a designer for the Cruise and Midnight Cruise labels, and the Pierre Cardin label. In 1989, Barton returned to Dunedin and started her own fashion line, followed by her own millinery business in 1992. In 1990, she took a part-time position tutoring in fashion drawing and fashion design at the Otago Polytechnic School of Design, which later became a full- time position. She still designed for her own labels, and in 1992 three of her swimwear designs were in the finals of the Benson & Hedges Fashion Design Awards. In 2012, Barton completed a Ph.D degree through Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology on millinery. Her thesis was titled Sketching Millinery in Three Dimensions: A Journey Between Physical and Digital Spaces, and studied animation software as a tool for sketching and pattern-making hats. In 1999 a collaborative entry with fellow Dunedin designer Andrea Bentley reached the finals in the Mittelmoda Fashion Designer Awards in Italy. The experience inspired Barton to establish a similar competition in Dunedin.

In addition to operating 7 beauty salons owned by herself, she is also active as a photographer. In order to give a spiritual message to the photo and create a work in its own style, she discovers female models at street corners around the world and produces all process from hair makeup to costume procurement and photography. With the art photo book \\"For Japanese Hairdressers\\" released in 13 cities in 6 countries in 2010. STEP BONE CUT technology was developed to increase the social status of hairdressers, bringing about a change in the beauty industry in Japan where there is no change and innovation does not occur.  Early life and education  She grew up in a home in which parents work, spent a girlhood like to love solitude and draw comics and imagine. She has few friends at school, and belonged to manga research group. She was immersed in the world of imagination and felt no loneliness at all. In junior high school days, she devoted herself to comics so that she posted as many as 16 pages of short story cartoons to publishers. In high school she joined the art department and because she was able to make many individual friends, she was far from comics and did not study very much too. She hoped to go to an art college or a design related school, but she entered a beauty school in a word of the teacher's \\"freelancer was hard.\\"Magical word II that has come true\\" (Gap Japan) Published July 2, 2014\\"Thinker 2011\\" (published by AIES, October 28, 2011)  First jobs  She got a job at a neighborhood beauty salon without a particularly strong purpose, the working hours were long, and the living was a shared room of 4 people. The first shop was a tough store for cleaning, but thanks to the custom of cleaning, she naturally became a leader by taking the initiative in cleaning in the workplace where she changed jobs after 5 years. Owing to her experience of handling eight cutting tables alone at that store, she became to think about efficiency always.  Independence  She was independent at the age of 25 years old and opened a first store. Number of clients increased in less than a year and the store management became stable. She was not good at communication, so she had problems with the relationship with the staff. Felling into a fierce self-hatred during the second store building, she fled to New York. She worked for 3 months at a salon where models and talents enter and leave, and took photography and creative work with the influence of a Jewish American photographer she met in New York. These had a great influence on Ushio's later life view. After returning home, an unexpected situation occurred that the staff was fraudulent of money. She was disgusted by business and thought about selling the store, but could not sell. After all, she left the first shop to another owner and started the second new shop with a few male staff. At the new store, she introduced an incentive system that was common in the US but had not been introduced in Japan. By pulling out the motivation of the staff with this management method, many skilled hairdressers gathered and an equal relationship with the staff was established. However, there were still some staff to quit the store. Ushio thought that it is due to lack of sufficient environment to keep growing as a company. She aimed to organize the rookie training curriculum, to make video manuals and to unify education. She reconsidered that the incentive system is not familiar in Japan, and returned it to former employment form.  Step bone cut  Current mainstream cutting technology is Vidal Sassoon cut developed in the West a half century ago and followed worldwide, but it is a cutting technique suitable for Westerners who have a solid skeleton, and oriental people looked big at the head. In addition, there are drawbacks that it is difficult to handle and the tip of the hair is damaged. Then STEP BONE CUT was developed to look like a small face according to the shape of Japanese skull by the Ushio. Ushio was once aiming for a comics artist, so it is not stuck with a fixed idea. She was able to conceive from studying hairstyles that move like a comicsillustration with free thought. Although there were patents in Japan in haircuts in the past., the STEP BONE CUT was the first in the world to obtain a patent with a haircut which can be done with any hair design.Sayuri Ushio\\"ART PHOTO BOOK\\" For Japanese Hairdressers?

After further refining it, she got the patent in Japan, set up the association and opened the academy. As a result, many Japanese hairdressers were able to improve customer unit price. The step bone cut was a technique developed to fit the skeleton of the oriental people, but Ushio tried applying it to Westerners as well. The cutting technique that pulls with gravity without adding unnecessary force was said to American hairdresser as \\"It looks like yoga and tai chi.\\" Then, Ushio opened the first New York store in Brooklyn District.

The sport was introduced in the country in Victoria in 2014 as a result of Blind Sports Victoria creating a blind football development program. A regional blind football league was created in Victoria in 2015.

Blind football continued to develop in 2017, governance of the sport was transferred to Blind Sports Australia who wanted to create a national team and develop the sport outside Victoria. That year also saw Australia get is first IBSA recognized blind football referees. In 2018, a talent development search took place in Sydney. The Victorian B-League season started at Melbourne's Docklands in 2015, with two divisions. It was open to B1, B2, B3 and sighted players. The Grand Final in the inaugural season was between FC Williamstown and Preston Lions FC. With a final score of 3 - 1, FC Williamstown emerged as the winners. National team development for both a blind (B1) and partially sighted (B2/B2) squads was underway in 2017 after Australian Blind Football took over governance of the sport. Michael Roski was named the head coach of the Australia men's national blind football team in June 2017.  History   2014  Blind football was first played in Australia in 2014. It was introduced to the country by Blind Sports Victoria (BSV) who created a blind football development program. In November Dave Connolly from Social Goal in Australia gave the IBSA an update on the development of blind football in Victoria, Australia. Connelly had been involved in the sport since 2013 and had attended that year's World Championships. Efforts to promote the sport that year included fund raising, an awareness-training session to skill up volunteers and an eight-week skill development program for 20 players. The IBSA quoted one player on the program who said \\"... I tell them I have been playing blind soccer they instantly ask me ‚Äúhow do you play it?‚Äù As people know soccer, they are intrigued and want to know more.\\" On 7 December 2014, before an A-League game between Melbourne City Football Club and Brisbane Roar, a demonstration of the sport took place. During halftime, an abbreviated game of blind football took place as a demonstration.  2015  Blind Sports Victoria and Social Goal had a goal in 2015 to develop a \\"Victorian B League\\" for inclusive visually impaired football, with blind, visually impaired and sighted men and women all playing on the same team. They were working with Football Federation Victoria.  2016  No Australian referees or international officials were chosen to officiate matches at the 2016 Summer Paralympics for blind football. Instead, referees and their coordinator came from France, Argentina, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Great Britain and Greece. In August 2016, Melbourne, Australia hosted a blind football workshop at the Knox Regional Football Centre on the 7th. IBSA Football Chairman Ulrich Pfisterer served as the workshop facilitator. Australian players that participated included Prasantha Wijeyasiri. Blind Sports NSW was also officially represented as attendees of the event. The event lasted two days. It was run in partnership with Blind Sports & Recreation Victoria with support from the Victoria B League. Following this, the IBSA held a blind football workshop in Auckland, New Zealand.  2017  By 2017, the development of blind football in Australia had been taken over by Blind Sports Australia. They were working towards growing the sport in Victoria and other parts of the country. In early 2017, blind football education workshops and national team selection trials took place in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide. Around 60 footballers, coaches and officials took part in these events. Following these workshops, the Blind Sports Australia - Australian Blind Football was created in May 2017. In June 2017, Australian Blind Football Coordinator Dave Connolly was quoted by the IBSA as saying, ‚ÄúIt has taken a couple of years to get to this stage but it is an exciting time for blind football in Australia. While visiting states during the rollout of the national education program, I experienced first-hand the enthusiasm for the game. A number of players even put their hand up to see what they could do to support the development of the sport. It is great to see there is so much enthusiasm, some of the players have ambitious goals and we want to help them to achieve these goals. It is really important to acknowledge how blind football can be a game changer for people who are blind or vision impaired in Australia.‚Äù Vision impaired Australian sportsperson Matthew Cameron participated in the Sydney workshop. Following it, he was quoted by the IBSA as saying, ‚ÄúOne thing I have always dreamed about is playing for my country in football. Now, that dream is within reach. After having to give up mainstream football due to my deteriorating vision I have been able to slip my goalkeeper gloves back on and do what I have always loved.‚Äù In August 2017, Australia had pending IBSA recognized international B1 Blind Football referees, to be on the list after an official IBSA Football Referees Seminar.

The film was screened by the CBFC just two weeks ahead of its release, and the producer was asked to make 20 cuts. Nihalani accused the CBFC chairperson, Prasoon Joshi, of favoritism, saying that preferential treatment was extended to big studios. Nihalani, an ex-chairperson of CBFC, vowed to take the CBFC the Bombay High Court over its decision. Reception Critical response Writing for Hindustan Times, Raja Sen articulated: \\"For the love of Govinda, don't watch this film. Zero star. Even Govinda's patented pelvic thrusts were harmless. He was never a toxic masculine threat, no vulgarian, merely a graceful clown. Nihalani, I'm sad to report, plumbs the depths to snatch this innocence from the actor. He assaults us with images of a sickening Govinda, a performance-enhancing rapist who laughs in the face of consequences. I emerged from this film traumatised. To paraphrase a Govinda hit: ‚ÄòAnkhiyon ko goli mare.‚Äô I want to blow my eyes out\\".

Training  Born in Casablanca, from the age of seven, P√©nicaud received \\"customized\\" and non- institutional musical training, first with his father (a good amateur guitarist who had learned from his mother, who herself had learned from his father; it would be necessary to go back in time to the ancient family history, to Ricardo Vi√±es, Pablo Casals, as well as to Ravel, Faur√©, and even to the old Brahms), then with friends of his music-loving family, teachers and concert performers (for example between the ages of eleven and thirteen, it was Narciso Yepes who gave him his precious advice). At the same time, he studied all the of flamenco. He also began to learn about jazz and improvisation from the age of thirteen. P√©nicaud first gave many classical - and flamenco - performances in private circles, but now he will play in public, in other musical genres (for example in jazz alongside Laurent Petitgirard at the organ of the ).  Guitarist  At the age of nineteen, he left the capital for Provence (advanced training - instrument and writing - teaching). He perfected his skills with Ren√© Bartoli, then with Leo Brouwer, Abel Carlevaro, Javier Hinojosa, as well as Paco Pe√±a and Manolo Sanlucar for flamenco. Later on, there will be other festivals in Provence, with for example Juan Carmona or the Chemirani sons (oriental percussions). He will also improvise a lot - sometimes to his own music - with jazz players, Larry Coryell, Rapha√´l Fa√øs, Jaco Pastorius, Barre Phillips...  Composer  Stopover at Mombasa This eclecticism acquired since childhood allows him to blend into each genre and will paradoxically lead him to refocus on musical composition, for which he was guided at first by his uncle and composer St√©phane Caplain. He can also be guided by the sea, the wind, the stars as Debussy and Ohana recommended: he travelled the Mediterranean by sailboat for years (later it would be all the oceans by cargo ship). He collects in passing many so-called \\"ethnic\\" music and he deepens again and again the writing of ancient and modern masters (since Machaut, to Stravinsky, Bart√≥k, Messiaen, Ohana etc.). P√©nicaud is part of the \\"New Music\\" Composers Group, alongside personalities such as Thierry Escaich, Anthony Girard, Philippe Hersant, Micha√´l Sebaoun...  His work  With Leo Brouwer, Italy, June 2008 His work won eight International Prizes for composition from 1984 to 2002: \\"Carrefour mondial de la guitare\\" (Martinique, 1984, 1988), Tokyo (1987), Italy (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002). In 2016, he was awarded the First Prize of Composition \\"International Art Society\\", in Volos, Greece; he also received the title \\"Artist of the Year\\": he is the only musician selected for this supreme distinction - all categories combined (for example in piano Martha Argerich) was mentioned. This brings to ten the number of his International Awards. A work of a homogeneous quality that is recognized and praised everywhere, by many composers (Leo Brouwer, R√©gis Campo, Pascal Dusapin, Thierry Escaich, Philippe F√©nelon, Philippe Hersant, Maurice Ohana...), various non-guitar great performers (flautist Pierre-Yves Artaud, percussionist Jean-Pierre Drouet, violists Garth Knox ‚Äì former member of the Arditti Quartet and the Ensemble Intercontemporain - and Pierre-Henri Xuereb, conductors Daniel Oren, Gilles Colliard...), guitarists and music educators (Julian Bream, Abel Carlevaro, Alberto Ponce, Narciso Yepes...), eminent ambassadors of other musics that he has also played for a long time (Jaco Pastorius, Larry Coryell, Juan Carmona, Egberto Gismonti...), and also - because it goes far beyond that - by poets (Christian Bobin), writers (Erik Orsenna, marine painters (), scientific thinkers (Boris Cyrulnik, Hubert Reeves)... In addition to the guitar, P√©nicaud has also written for some thirty instruments, piano, percussion, strings, various flutes, voice, harp, clarinet, oboe, string quartet, various ensembles, and many instruments in jazz formation (keyboards, bass guitar, various saxophones, etc.).

She served as the first female mayor of Stepney, and the first female Jewish mayor in the United Kingdom. Personal life Moses was born in the East End of London on 13 November 1884 to Mark and Hannah Moses. Her father had been born in Torun, then in Germany, and had come to the United Kingdom in 1863 at the age of eight. In London, Mark Moses became a tailor, local councillor, justice of the peace and member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Her mother was a charity worker. Miriam Moses studied at Old Castle Street school in Whitechapel. She appeared on This Is Your Life in 1958. Moses died on 24 June 1965 at Middlesex Hospital. Political career Moses stood for election under the label of the Progressive Party, which was a party for local elections in London based around the Liberal Party with initial support from the Labour Party. By the time Moses contested elections, Labour was competing against the Progressives, and in 1925 the label was retired across the city and she stood as an independent candidate. She was chair of the Whitechapel Liberal Association for many years. In 1921, Moses became a Progressive councillor for Spitalfields East ward in the East End of London, replacing her father upon his death. She held the seat until standing down in 1934, when the ward returned Labour councillors. The Labour Party's failure to take the seat until then has been credited to Moses's personal popularity, which was reflected in her heading the polls in the ward by a substantial majority at every election. One of her colleagues suggested that her social work meant that many Jewish voters associated her more with her community work than her politics. Moses unsuccessfully sought the Liberal nomination for the 1930 Whitechapel and St Georges by-election. The municipal election of 1931 had resulted in a hung council, with thirty Conservative-aligned Municipal Reform Party councillors, twenty-six Labour councillors and four independents including Moses. With the support of Municipal Reform Councillors, Moses narrowly defeated Labour's J. H. Hall to be elected as the first female Mayor of Stepney, and the first female Jewish mayor in the country. Labour opponents questioned her personal integrity, with some describing her as \\"Shylock\\" following her election. Moses's personal political style has been described as \\"crusading zeal\\". She supported the municipal provision of contraception for poor mothers, and in 1933 proposed a Jewish charitable solution for funding a housing programme. She opposed giving exceptions to Sunday trading laws for Jewish traders. She supported Henrietta Adler in condemning anti-immigrant housing policies of the Municipal Reform Party in 1932. Social work Moses was school manager for two local schools, and served on committees for local charities and the board of guardians, which was responsible for implementing the Poor Law. In 1922, she became the first female justice of the peace in Whitechapel. With Elsie Cohen, she co-founded the Brady Girls' Club in 1925, as a parallel to the older Brady Boys' Club, which was one of the first Jewish boys' clubs in the country. During the First World War, Moses served as a nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment. She was chief air raid officer for her neighbourhood throughout the Second World War, during which time she established a hostel for girls made homeless by bombing. In 1945, she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her bravery in the latter role. Religion An observant Orthodox Jew, Moses served on the Board of Deputies representing New Synagogue on Stamford Hill‚Äîthe first woman representing any constituent of the United Synagogue. In this role, she pushed for women's voting rights for the executive of the United Synagogue, succeeding in 1954. She was a founder member of the League of Jewish Women, later serving as president. She also served on the executives of the Jewish Board of Guardians and the Association of Jewish Youth. She was a member of the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage.

Around 1880/81 he and his eldest son Alfred, with his nephew Oates Jagger, travelled to Monte Carlo with money borrowed from friends and family.

The expression \\"breaking the bank\\" is used when a gambler wins more money than the reserve held at that particular table in the casino. At the start of each day, every table was funded with a cash reserve of 100,000 francs ‚Äì known as \\"the bank\\". If this reserve was insufficient to pay the winnings, play at that table was suspended while extra funds were brought out from the casino's vaults. In a ceremony devised by Fran√ßois Blanc, the original owner of the casino, a black cloth was laid over the table in question, and the successful player was said to have broken the bank. After an interval the table re-opened and play continued.Herald, G. W. and Radin, E. D.: The Big Wheel (London: Robert Hale, 1965) The manufacturers of the roulette tables later introduced movable partitions into their tables to frustrate Jagger's method. On his return to Yorkshire, Jagger used some of the money to purchase houses in Little Horton, Bradford, that were occupied by members of his family.

Australian Bank (ABL) was an Australian retail bank that operated between 1981 and 1989. It was established by Perth businessman Garrick Agnew (its first chairman) and Sydney-based Mark Johnson (its first CEO). Johnson was also a co-founder of Macquarie Group. History At the time of its establishment in 1981, it was the first new trading bank in Australia since 1945. In the late 1970s, Agnew had expressed concerns that Australian banks weren‚Äôt sufficiently competitive. During a discussion with fellow Western Australian John Stone (then Secretary to the Treasury), Stone suggested (possibly in jest) that, if Agnew were so concerned, he should establish a bank of his own. The bank opened offices in Perth (190 St George‚Äôs Terrace), Sydney (17 O‚ÄôConnell Street) and Melbourne (400 Collins Street, moving to 395 Collins Street from mid 1985). Whilst initially successful, the bank soon struggled in the wake of the turmoil in the Australian banking environment during the mid to late 1980s, particularly with bad debts arising from overseas loan funding following the floating of the Australian Dollar in December 1983. The bank downsized through a series of staff redundancies commencing in early 1986, and finally wound up in February 1989 following its purchase by State Bank of Victoria.

He studied from 1873 at the Technical University of Aachen and was trained in addition to the stonemason and sculptor at the Cologne Dombauh√ºtte. In Mainz he was named church master builder (Kirchenbaumeister) in 1884, and cathedral master builder (Dombaumeister) from 1909 to 1940. After 1909 he partnered with Anton Falkowski, and later with his son, the church architect Hugo Becker (1897-1967). Becker also worked as a construction researcher at the Mainz Cathedral, who brought important findings to light; however, his conclusions were flawed. His thesis was that the construction of the Mainz Cathedral was already begun in Constantine the Great's time in the 4th century, but he could not convincingly demonstrate the claim, which was unanimously rejected by experts. Becker's grave is in Mainz's main cemetery. Work St Maurice's Church in Strasbourg Herz-Jesu-Kirche in KoblenzSt. Joseph in Montigny-l√®s-MetzHerz-Jesu-Kirche, MainzHerz-Jesu-Kirche in Saarbr√ºcken Becker dealt with over 300 churches, which he restored, rebuilt or rebuilt. He used numerous styles of various historical architectural styles, as is customary in historicism. He designed many buildings together with his business partner Anton Falkowski. Becker and Falkowski preferred Romanesque and Gothic before the First World War, then simple baroque. From about 1930, expressionist stylistic devices were also used. * Catholic parish Church of the Assumption in Kirrberg, 1881-1893 * Catholic parish Church of St. Mary in Bad Homburg before the height, designed in 1889, executed 1892-1895 * Catholic parish Church of St. Joseph in St. Ingbert, 1890-1893 * Catholic parish Church of St. Martin in Oestrich (restoration), 1890-1893 * Tomb chapel of the family Wambolt of Umstadt in the castle Birkenau (Odenwald), 1891 * Catholic garrison Church St. Mauritius in Strasbourg, Arnoldsplatz, competition 1893, completed 1899 * Catholic parish Church of St. Bartholomew in Zornheim, 1893-1894 * Catholic parish Church of St. Mary's Conception in D√ºsseldorf, 1894-1896 * Catholic parish Church of the Holy Cross in Bad Kreuznach, Wilhelmstra√üe, 1895-1897 * Catholic parish Church of St. Rochus in Kaiserslautern-Hohenecken, 1896-1897 * Catholic parish Church of St. Michael in Unter-Hambach (Heppenheim), 1897-1899 * Catholic parish Church of St. Lawrence in Bobenheim, 1898 * Catholic parish Church of St. Matthew in Bad Sobernheim, 1898-1899 * Episcopal Convict in Bensheim, 1899-1900 * Catholic parish Church of the Sacred Heart in Bad Kreuznach-Planig, 1900 * Catholic parish Church of St. Lutwinus in Mettlach, 1899-1902 * Catholic parish Church of St. Agatha in Altenhundem (with ), 1900-1901 * Catholic parish Church of St. Hubertus in Nonnweiler, 1900-1902 * Catholic parish Church of St. Bernard in Clausen, 1900-1903 * Catholic parish Church of the Sacred Heart in Koblenz, L√∂hrrondell, 1900-1903 * Catholic parish Church of St. Peter in Heppenheim (Bergstra√üe), Kirchgasse, 1900-1904 * Catholic parish Church of St. Joseph in Hagen, 1901-1906 * Catholic parish Church of St. Fridolin in Mulhouse, 1901-1906 * Catholic parish Church of St. Joseph in Montigny-l√®s-Metz, 1901-1906 (inauguration 29th July 1906) * Artisan house in Art Nouveau style on the M√§rtmannstrasse in Dortmund-Aplerbeck 1902-1904 * Catholic parish Church of St. Boniface in Neuenkirchen (Oldenburg), 1902-1905 (with ) * Catholic parish Church of St. Pankratius in Buldern (with ) * Catholic parish Church of St. Lawrence in Sommerau in the Spessart, 1902 to about 1906.

Biography Born in Store Heddinge on the Danish island of Zealand, Jutta Kunigunde Bojsen was the daughter of Frederik Engelhardt Boisen (1808‚Äì1882), a parish priest, and the writer Eline Birgitte Heramb (1813‚Äì1871). In 1857, she married the parish priest Otto Ditlev M√∏ller (1814‚Äì1892) with whom she had eight children. One of a family of 11, she was brought up in Sk√∏rpinge near Slagelse where her father was appointed as parish priest shortly after her birth. Together with her siblings, she was educated at home by private tutors with an emphasis on Grundtvigian principles. After her husband died in 1892, she became the matron at the folk high school in Lyngby, adopting the same position from 1905 to 1909 at R√∏dkilde H√∏jskole on the island of M√∏n, founded by her brother Frede Bojsen. Thanks to her friendship with the poet Jens Christian Hostrup and his wife Elisabeth, both of whom were active in the Danish Women's Society, she became increasingly interested in the women's movement. In 1894, encouraged by Astrid Hostrup who was active both as a folk high school matron and as a member of the Women's Society, Bojsen-M√∏ller joined the organization and was immediately elected president, a post she kept until 1910. She took an early interest in women's voting rights, becoming a member of the Women's Society's Voting Rights Committee when it was founded in 1898. Only in 1906 did she and Louise N√∏rlund succeed in making women's suffrage an official item on the organizations agenda. She did much to extend the interests of the Women's Society over the whole of Denmark. Under her remit, membership increased from 1,000 to 7,000 and in 1915, women obtained the right to vote. Jutta Bojsen-M√∏ller died in Copenhagen on 12 January 1927 and is buried in Lynge's old cemetery. Awards In recognition of her services, in 1925 she was honoured with the gold Medal of Merit.

After several years of filming everyday scenes from his life, Mekas was commissioned by the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery to make Walden. It was his first major diary film, and he named it after Henry David Thoreau's 1854 memoir Walden. Mekas's film has received acclaim as a work of avant-garde cinema. Description Walden is divided into four sections. It shows a chronicle of events in Mekas's life, with intertitles describing the images that precede or follow them. The soundtrack alternates between music, narration by Mekas, and environmental sounds. The scenes show social visits with friends as well as various social events, such as weddings. Many famous figures of the American avant-garde make appearances in the film. Production Director Jonas Mekas in 2011 Principal photography Mekas shot Walden on a Bolex 16 mm camera between 1964 and 1968. He made use of many types of film stock based on availability, sometimes switching to black-and-white when he ran out of color stock. Mekas ordered one-light prints from film laboratories, and the lack of color timing meant that prints had very different tints. He had a Nagra and a Sony audio recorder with which he recorded sound from the scenes he was filming. Mekas's cinematography differs sharply from the style of home movies. Where most hobbyists aim to replicate the look and feel of conventional studio movies, Mekas's camera work is aggressive and unstable, moving erratically in wild gestures. The improvisational rhythms of Marie Menken's camera work were a major influence on his style. Post-production As Mekas continued to film over the years, financial constraints limited his ability to make completed films. The Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery commissioned him to make a film for a celebration it was planning. The gallery gave him ten months to complete the project, with a small grant of around $2,000. Musician John Cale recorded some background music for the film. Mekas doubled the speed of Cale's recording and used it for a 15-minute segment in Walden. While editing, he played vinyl records, a radio, and televisions in various combinations so that he could seize any opportunity to record interesting music for the film. He used the film stocks' different tints as a way to structure some of the sequences based on color. Mekas continued editing the film after the premiere and added additional material, using about a third of all the footage he had shot. He finished working on it in 1969. Themes This intertitle appears next to scenes in Central Park. Mekas titled his film after Thoreau's transcendentalist book Walden. Having first read the book in German during the 1940s, Mekas reread it in English in 1961. Thoreau's memoir became a central metaphor for Mekas's film. Both works emphasize a personal, first-person perspective. Mekas draws a connection between Walden Pond and Central Park through multiple intertitles labeling it \\"Walden\\". He explained that the association with Walden was not limited to the park: The film is dedicated to the Lumi√®re brothers, whose early actuality films were precursors to documentary filmmaking. The Lumi√®res' unstructured, single-shot works depicting informal moments served as an inspiration to avant-garde filmmakers working in new forms outside of mainstream cinema. Mekas also references cinema's past through his use of intertitles, associated with the silent era after they were largely abandoned in the transition to sound. Release Before the invitation from the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery, Mekas began distributing four short films based on the same footage: Cassis, Notes on the Circus, Report from Millbrook, and Hare Krishna. Different versions of Cassis and Report from Millbrook appear in Walden. As part of the Buffalo Festival of the Arts Today, Mekas premiered the first cut of Walden at the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery in March 1968, before producing the longer final cut. He distributed it through the Film-Makers' Cooperative. The film was selected to screen at the first International Underground Film Festival in London. Jackie Kennedy held a screening of it for Mother's Day. This led to a project, later abandoned, in which Mekas would have documented her life through home movies and family photos. Anthology Film Archives added Walden to its Essential Cinema Repertory collection. The Smithsonian American Art Museum purchased a print of Walden for its collection. Re:Voir released Walden on VHS in 2003, along with The Walden Book. The book contains a scene-by-scene outline of the original cut of the film. Kino Lorber released the film on Blu-ray in November 2015. Critical reception Contemporary reaction to Walden was positive. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that \\"Mekas has a remarkable gift for making us see, as if for the first time, what we've been looking at all our lives.\\" Critic Dave Kehr said that Walden \\"radiates sociability and warmth‚Ä¶Innocent of technique, it overflows with truth.\\" J. Hoberman wrote that Mekas's camera technique was a breakthrough that \\"freed [him] from both conventional film technique and narrative restraint.\\" Notes External links * Walden at the Film-Makers' Cooperative * 1960s avant-garde and experimental films 1968 documentary films American avant-garde and experimental films American documentary films Autobiographical documentary films Films directed by Jonas Mekas American films ","title":"Walden (film)"},{"id":"58770799","text":"Huang Jong-tsun (; born 30 March 1947) is a Taiwanese politician and psychologist who serves as the current President of the Examination Yuan.

Biography  Yitzhak Nener was born in 1919 in Vienna, Austria, and as an infant his family moved to the city of Stanis≈Çaw√≥w in Galicia, Poland, now Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine. In 1938, at the age of 19, he moved to Mandatory Palestine, making the journey on a ship with almost 1,000 Jewish students from all over Poland enrolled at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He travelled on the ship with fellow student and Zionist activist, Blanca Stein; they married each other the following year, in 1939. Both of their families, who they had left behind in Poland perished in the Holocaust. At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Nener studied social sciences, sociology, philosophy and history, and later law at the British Mandate High School of Law, writing one of the first academic publications on the Holocaust.

Founded in 1959, the charity's services include the provision of artwork loans, art projects and art workshops to health and social care organisations. The charity's activities are based on clinical evidence demonstrating health and wellbeing benefits of the arts to patients and care staff. The charity owns and manages the Paintings in Hospitals collection: a loan collection of modern and contemporary art. The Paintings in Hospitals collection is the only known national art loan collection with the specific purpose of improving health and wellbeing. Paintings in Hospitals is the healthcare partner of the Arts Council Collection. The charity was recognised by the Department of Health and Arts Council England as a key provider of arts and health services in the 2007 UK government publication \\"A prospectus for arts and health\\".  History  Paintings in Hospitals was founded in 1959 by Sheridan Russell, Head Almoner at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. From the early 1950s, Russell had observed that the paintings of contemporary artists were far more effective than the existing reproductions in brightening up the corridors and waiting rooms of the hospital. Russell persuaded his art-world contacts to donate artworks for display in the hospital's corridors and waiting rooms. Initially, administration of the hospital art scheme was through an advisory committee of art experts, established under the leadership of Sir Dennis Proctor, former chair of the Tate Gallery. Russell formalised the art loan programme in 1959 under the name Paintings in Hospitals. In 1960 it gained significant financial support from the Nuffield Foundation over a period of 15 years to establish a permanent collection of artworks for loan to other hospitals. Early acquisitions for the Paintings in Hospitals collection included paintings by John Bratby, Gillian Ayres and Mary Fedden. Within a period of ten years, the Paintings in Hospitals scheme grew to include 40 hospitals. In 1971, when the scheme registered as a charity, a board of trustees administered the programme. Board members at that time included Sir Dennis Proctor, Lawrence Gowing, and Eric Newton, who were later joined by Roger de Grey, former President of the Royal Academy and Lord Croft. In the 1980s, the charity began to develop a regional network of volunteer committees, enabling hospitals and other types of care sites outside of London to access the Paintings in Hospitals collection. In 1991, the charity provided seed funding and a loan of 100 paintings to establish Paintings in Hospitals Scotland. In 2005, Paintings in Hospitals Scotland became an independent Scottish charity with a name change to Art in Healthcare. Paintings in Hospitals celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009. The charity celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2019, with events including a collection of 60 weekly articles from notable artists, patients, and carers and a panel discussion on the future of the arts-in-health sector at the Royal College of Physicians, with speakers Edmund de Waal, Errol Francis, Val Huet, Victoria Tischler, and Ed Vaizey. Paintings in Hospitals was shortlisted for the 'Special Recognition Award' at the Charity Today Awards 2019.  The Paintings in Hospitals collection  The Paintings in Hospitals collection is widely recognised as the first national collection of art specifically created to support physical and mental health. The collection holds approximately 4,000 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, animations and photographs from artists including Andy Warhol and Antony Gormley. Around 70% of the collection is on public display at all times. Artworks on loan from Paintings in Hospitals to health and social care organisations in the United Kingdom are seen by approximately two million patients every year. In January 2002, The Saatchi Gallery donated 50 artworks to Paintings in Hospitals, including works by artists Simon Callery, Nicholas May, Joanna Price, Stephen Murphy, Carol Rhodes and Robert Wilson. In 2011, Paintings in Hospitals unveiled their children's collection, designed to make healthcare sites more comfortable for children, especially teens and young adults. The artworks in the children's collection were chosen through workshops and discussions with young people from Tate Collective, the Tate's youth forum, and included artworks by Albert Irvin, John Hoyland, and Quentin Blake. Paintings in Hospitals' discussions with Tate Collective also resulted in the charity commissioning three new artworks, to be permanently added to its collection, by New York-based artist Jon Burgerman. In 2012, Dame Stephanie Shirley donated the entirety of her art collection, including works by Andy Warhol and Elisabeth Frink, to Prior's Court School and Paintings in Hospitals. The chair of the charity's Collection committee is trustee David Cleaton-Roberts, director at Cristea Roberts Gallery.https://www.paintingsinhospitals.org.uk/our-committees  Partnerships  Paintings in Hospitals is the healthcare partner of the Arts Council Collection. The Arts Council Collection has made 100 works of art available to Paintings in Hospitals enabling the charity to bring a new selection of work by contemporary artists into the healthcare system. In 2018, the two organisations partnered to produce the touring exhibition and symposium Rooted in the Landscape, designed to explore the relationship between art, wellbeing and the natural environment. The exhibition included artists Andy Goldsworthy, Marc Quinn, and Turner Prize-nominated Janice Kerbel. The charity has worked with the V&A; Museum over a period of 15 years to produce seven hospital exhibitions of artworks from the museum's collection. For some of the artworks, these exhibitions marked the first time they had been exhibited publicly. In 2012, Paintings in Hospitals was gifted five posters by the London Transport Museum as part of the museum‚Äôs Access to Art initiative. In celebration of the gift, Paintings in Hospitals partnered with the museum to invite a group of carers to create an original soundscape. In 2015, the charity collaborated with Hayward Gallery to bring art by Michael Craig-Martin to Vassall Medical Centre, London, and the National Spinal Injuries Centre, Buckinghamshire. In 2016, Paintings in Hospitals partnered with the Wallace Collection and contemporary artist Tom Ellis to commission four large-scale paintings for GP surgeries across London. In the same year, the charity partnered with the Ingram Collection of Modern British Art to bring artworks from the collection to care homes in the South East of England. In 2017, the charity began a three-year partnership with the Central Saint Martins art school. Students from the school's BA Culture, Criticism and Curation course explore the ways in which art might support the mental health of their peers with an annual exhibition at the Menier Gallery and at King's College London. In 2018 the charity partnered with the Barns-Graham Trust seeking an emerging curator to develop a new touring exhibition of works by Wilhelmina Barns- Graham. The resulting exhibition, Linear Meditations, was shortlisted for 'Art Installation of the Year' at the Design in Mental Health Awards 2019. In 2019, Paintings in Hospitals partnered with the National Gallery to place Self- Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria by the Italian Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi on display at Pocklington Group Practice, a GP surgery in East Yorkshire. In 2020, Paintings in Hospitals partnered with Google Arts & Culture to bring part of their art collection onto the online platform and to collaborate with the artist Tom Croft on the virtual exhibition Healthcare Heroes.

Born on July 28, 1925, in the Ulmale Parish of the Aizpute District in a Baptist family, she was baptized at the age of 13 at a Baptist congregation in Saka. After World War II, Lasmane began to study nursing in Riga. She and members of her family were arrested for the first time for delivering medications and bandage materials to Latvian partisans. In April 1947, the War Tribunal of the Soviet Latvian Interior Ministry Armed Forces sentenced Lidija Lasmane to five years in a concentration camp, with limitation of her rights to last for three years afterward. Her father, Andrejs Lasmanis, was sentenced to 10 years, while her mother received a suspended sentence of three years. While at a labor camp called Vosturallag in the eastern Ural Mountains, Lidija came down with a case of tuberculosis. In 1951, she was sent for life to Vorkuta, where she met her future husband, Mikhail Doronin. After Stalin's death, Lidija Lasmane was allowed to return to Latvia, where she lived with her cousin, Edvards Lasmanis, in the Me≈æaparks neighborhood. In 1970, she was arrested again for reading illegal literature and distributing handwritten copies of same. The Soviet Latvian Supreme Court sentenced Doronina-Lasmane to two years in prison for \\"the distribution of purposefully untrue imaginations which discredit the Soviet state and its social order.\\" She served this sentence at the Dzegu≈ækalns women's prison in the Iƒºƒ£uciems neighborhood of Riga. She was arrested for a third time during the repressions of the era of Yuri Andropov on January 6, 1983, along with JƒÅnis Ro≈ækalns, GunƒÅrs Astra and JƒÅnis Vƒìvers, accused of \\"anti-Soviet propaganda and campaigning.\\" The Soviet Latvian Supreme Court sentenced her in August 1983 to five years at a labor camp in Mordovia and then to three years in a settlement outside of Latvia. During the perestroika age of Mikhail Gorbachev, Doro≈Üina-Lasmane was liberated on January 14, 1987, and was sent to a camp in the Altay region of Siberia for several months. During the summer of 1987, Doro≈Üina-Lasmane returned to Latvia. After the restoration of the independence of the Republic of Latvia, she restored her maiden name, Lasmane, and became an active employee of the Center to Document the Consequences of Totalitarianism. In 1994, Doro≈Üina- Lasmane received the Order of Three Stars, Fifth Grade, but she refused to accept it because, she said, several KGB agents would be presented with the order together with her.

Morral affair  Following his attempted bombing of Spanish King Alfonso XIII's vehicle on return from his wedding in May 1906, which killed 24 bystanders and military, wounded over 100, and left the royals unscathed, the anarchist fugitive Mateo Morral sought refuge from Nakens. Nakens was a vocal opponent of anarchism, but his anticlerical leadership attracted such radicals. Historians have disagreed as to whether Morral's choice of approaching Nakens was premeditated, but Morral was likely introduced to Nakens through Ferrer's school, which purchased the journalist's anticlerical writings. Morral introduced himself as the assassin upon entering Nakens' printing press and recounted how Nakens had previously helped Michele Angiolillo, the Italian anarchist who had assassinated the Spanish Prime Minister in 1897. Nakens was hesitant but agreed to help. He hid Morral at the press while arranging lodging for Morral, and returned 90 minutes later to transport him to a friend's house for the night. But Morral grew distrustful during the night and was gone by morning. The fugitive died a day later. On the day of Morral's death, the republican journalist Jos√© Nakens had published a denunciation of the regicide attempt and terrorism writ large in his journal, El Mot√≠n, without mentioning Morral or Nakens' own harboring of the fugitive. He was arrested within the week and the next day published a full accounting of his actions in two newspapers, in which he reaffirmed his opposition to anarchism, described Morral's attack as cowardly, and recanted his brief support of Morral as misguided but driven by his desire to help his fellow man. The judgement in Nakens' case came easily. While the court believed that Nakens had no prior connection with Morral, they found that his planning for Morral was more deliberate than a brief lapse of judgement. They argued that this aid led to Morral's pre-suicide murder of a villager, and for this aid, sentenced Nakens to nine years of prison and financial restitution for the Royals, the military, and families affected by the bombing. Nakens' friends Bernardo Mata and Isidro Ibarra were jailed as well. Only half of his prison time between his June 1906 arrest and June 1907 sentencing was commuted. For Nakens' initial months, he could not bear to read the newspapers and was not aware of the republican campaign for his royal pardon. In Madrid's C√°rcel Modelo prison, Nakens became an advocate for prison reform. He received unlimited space in a republican daily newspaper, El Pa√≠s, where he wrote about sordid prison conditions and, in turn, improved his standing with those previously upset by his harboring of Morral. Nakens wrote about prisoner malnourishment, disease, lack of heating, neglect from underpaid guards, and uncomforting clergy. He renewed calls for a more secular and humane prison system as a platform that combined his anticlericalism with the issue of prison reform. Simultaneously, a campaign mounted for Nakens' pardon. Even before his sentencing, republican papers called for his release, the prime minister and his cabinet received international letters daily, and prison officials described Nakens as a reformed, model prisoner. Ultimately, President Antonio Maura recommended the pardon of Nakens and his friends in May 1908, which Alfonso XIII granted. The affair spotlighted Spanish republican fissures that would become an identity crisis, as Nakens impatiently broke from the gradualist philosophy of the old generation of republicans and both republican factions showed intransigence towards cooperation. Fallout from the affair appeared to favor the republican moderates (Gumersindo de Azc√°rate, Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n), who condemned the radical, young republicans (Alejandro Lerroux, Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez) and made Nakens appear, by juxtaposition, to be unstable. This schism appeared to hasten the coming revolution. In hindsight, historian Enrique Sanabria proposes Nakens as a tragic parable: that Nakens' decision to hide Morral reflected a willingness to work with revolutionaries that, when pronounced, would ostracize him from his more moderate republican colleagues. Nakens was shortsighted to believe that his messages of egalitarianism, democracy, and cultural revolution would not appeal to the leftists he sought to avoid, and his popularity within anarchist and radical circles reflected anticlericalism's status as a uniting force across the left. But whereas anticlericalism was attached to nationalism for republicans like Nakens, it was not necessarily attached for anarchists and socialists. Nakens \\"became political roadkill\\" in the aftermath of the affair for his inability to draw an audience of workers while tolerating their revolutionary politics.  Renewed anticlericalism  Upon his release from prison, Nakens worked out of poverty until he could reopen El Mot√≠n in October 1908. Further radicalized, he planned to make radical anticlericalism its primary message. The periodical was present through the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera.

The Dirac field is mathematically described by a spinor, an object that consists of four complex scalar components that transform in terms of complex representations of the Lorentz group. Because each component is a complex scalar function, it can be written as the product of a module times a unitary complex phase. When this is done for all components of the spinor, while still respecting the manifest co-variance, the result is the polar form of the Dirac spinor field. Its mathematical expression can be given by first assigning some preliminary definitions. The gamma matrices \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}^{a} are introduced as the element of the Clifford algebra \\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}_{a},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}_{b}\\\\\\\\}=2\\\\mathbb{I}\\\\eta_{ab} and from that we can define :\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\left[\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}_{a}\\\\\\\\!,\\\\\\\\!\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}_{b}\\\\right]\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}_{ab} as well as the \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma^5} matrix: we also have \\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!\\\\psi^{\\\\dagger}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}_{0} as the operation of spinor conjugation. Spinor bi-linear quantities are defined according to :S^{a}\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}^{a}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma^5}\\\\psi :U^{a}\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma}^{a}\\\\psi :\\\\Theta\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!i\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma^5}\\\\psi :\\\\Phi\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!\\\\overline{\\\\psi}\\\\psi all of which are real tensors. According to the values of these bi-linear quantities, spinor fields can be classified in various ways: if both \\\\Theta and \\\\Phi vanish identically, the spinor field is called singular, and the class of singular spinor fields contains the notable cases of Majorana spinor and Weyl spinor. However, if in general, \\\\Theta and \\\\Phi do not vanish simultaneously, the spinor field is called regular, and in this case it is always possible to find a local frame in which the regular spinor field acquires the form: :\\\\psi\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!\\\\phi\\\\ e^{-\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\beta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma^5}}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{array}\\\\right) up to a transformation of the type \\\\psi\\\\rightarrow\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma^5}\\\\psi and up to the reversal of the third axis. Therefore, a regular spinor can, in general, be written according to :\\\\psi\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!\\\\phi\\\\ e^{-\\\\frac{i}{2}\\\\beta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\gamma^5}}\\\\boldsymbol{S}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{array}\\\\right) where \\\\phi is called module and \\\\beta is called Yvon-Takabayashi angle, and where \\\\boldsymbol{S} is the generic complex representation of the Lorentz transformation that is needed to obtain the generic spinor in its most reduced form as written above. When the spinor is written in polar form, the bi-linear quantities can be written according to :S^{a}\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!2\\\\phi^{2}s^{a} :U^{a}\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!2\\\\phi^{2}u^{a} where u^{a} is the velocity vector and s^{a} is the spin axial velocity, and :\\\\Theta\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!2\\\\phi^{2}\\\\sin{\\\\beta} :\\\\Phi\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!2\\\\phi^{2}\\\\cos{\\\\beta} in terms of module and Yvon-Takabayashi angle. The polar form given in the case in which \\\\boldsymbol{S}=\\\\mathbb{I} corresponds to the case in which the velocity vector has only its temporal component and the spin axial-vector has only its third component, so that the full polar form is the one associated to the spinor rest frame and spin eigenstate. This shows that the module and Yvon-Takabayashi angle are the only two real degrees of freedom. The frame in which the polar form is obtained is locally defined, meaning that the transformation \\\\boldsymbol{S} is generally point-dependent: so it is always possible to write :\\\\boldsymbol{S}\\\\partial_{\\\\mu}\\\\boldsymbol{S}^{-1}\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!i\\\\partial_{\\\\mu}\\\\theta\\\\mathbb{I}\\\\\\\\!+\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\partial_{\\\\mu}\\\\theta_{ij}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}^{ij} where \\\\theta is a generic complex phase and \\\\theta_{ij}\\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!-\\\\theta_{ji} are the six parameters of Lorentz transformations (namely, the three Euler angles and the three rapidities). By introducing a spin connection \\\\Omega_{ij\\\\mu} as well as an electrodynamic gauge potential A_{\\\\mu} it is possible to define :\\\\partial_{\\\\mu}\\\\theta_{ij}\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!\\\\Omega_{ij\\\\mu}\\\\\\\\!\\\\equiv\\\\\\\\!R_{ij\\\\mu} :\\\\partial_{\\\\mu}\\\\theta\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!qA_{\\\\mu}\\\\\\\\!\\\\equiv\\\\\\\\!P_{\\\\mu} which can be proven to be gauge covariant real tensors. In terms of these elements, it is possible to prove that the Dirac equation for a spinor field in polar form implies the two equations \\\\\\\\!=\\\\\\\\!0 |cellpadding |border |border colour =#50C878 |background colour = #ECFCF4}} where for generality W_{\\\\mu} serves as the axial-vector dual of the completely anti-symmetric part of the torsion tensor; conversely, it is possible to prove that these two equations imply the Dirac equation with the spinor written in the polar form, proving their equivalence. These two equations specify all first-order derivatives of the two physical components given by the module and the Yvon-Takabayashi angle. Therefore, the Dirac spinor field equation, which is four complex equations and therefore eight equations in total, is equivalently written in terms of two real vectorial equations, which are two four-dimensional equations and therefore eight equations in total. This pair of coupled first-order differential equations is the polar form of the Dirac equation.

It was built in 1840 by George Hill. The property is owned by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Governor Phillip established the boundary of the Sydney Cove settlement in 1792 when he drew a line from the head of Cockle Bay to the head of Woolloomooloo Bay. East of that line was reserved for the town and west of the line, which included present-day Surry Hills was considered suitable for farming and was granted to military officers and free settlers. The first land grants in the Surry Hills area were made in the 1790s. Captain Joseph Foveaux received and Commissary John Palmer received in April and another adjoining soon after. He called the property George Farm and in 1800 Palmer also bought Faveaux's farm. Palmer supported Governor Bligh during the Rum Rebellion and returned to England to give evidence. On his return, his reduced financial circumstances forced the sale of his land. The sale of Palmer's estate in 1814 was the first subdivision in Surry Hills. Other key dates include: *1814 (August) - Isaac Nichols bought Allotment 20, comprising over of John Palmer's estate. *1833 - Nichol's estate was subdivided and sold.

The site contains the main wing, kitchen wing and two small outbuildings. The main wing comprises two single storey colonial sandstock brick cottages with attic accommodation, corrugated steel roof, front and rear stone flagged verandahs, shuttered 12 pane double hung sash windows with flat gauged arches and six panel front doors with Georgian style semi-circular fanlights over. The two cottages were originally built as two freestanding buildings, joined together by an early addition to form a row. A two-storey sandstock brick kitchen block with shingled roof is located at the rear of the site. A single story glazed timber framed addition is attached on the south elevation. A modern glazed, steel barred-vaulted pavilion is located between the main wign and kitchen wing. Two outbuildings are also present, a brick and weatherboard laundry and store and a timber shadehouse/gazebo.  Heritage listing  As at 2 June 2006, the cottages at 203‚Äì205 Albion Street, Surry Hills demonstrate the development of Surry Hills following the break up of the Palmer Estate in 1814. They survive as examples of the first phase of residential development in the area and belong to an important group of surviving Colonial Georgian buildings in Surry Hills.Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners 2004 Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The cottages demonstrate the development of Surry Hills following the break up of the Palmer Estate in 1814. They survive as examples of the first phase of residential development in the area and belong to an important group of surviving Georgian buildings in Surry Hills. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The cottages retain many Georgian style features such as the sandstone verandah flagging, chimney pieces, doors, sash windows with shutters, one original staircase and semi-circular fanlights with glazing bars over the doors. They represent good examples of a simple Georgian colonial building style, relatively intact. There are also examples of \\"storey and a half\\" cottages, a common colonial building form that was discontinued after about 1860. The front verandah screens, although reconstructed, are now rare architectural features of the colonial period. The cottages also make a significant contribution to the streetscape of Albion Street and form a group with other nearby examples of Georgian style buildings. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cottages display considerable archaeological potential and have some potential for research into early building techniques.

The struggle stemmed from the government's decision to construct the airport in Sanrizuka without the involvement or consent of most area residents. The struggle was led by the Sanrizuka-Shibayama United Opposition League against Construction of the Narita Airport (:ja:‰∏âÈáåÂ°öËäùÂ±±ÈÄ£ÂêàÁ©∫Ê∏ØÂèçÂØæÂêåÁõü, Sanrizuka-Shibayama Rengo K≈´k≈ç Hantai D≈çmei), which locals formed under the leadership of opposition parties the Communist Party and Social Democratic Party. The group became radical, and the struggle resulted in significant delays in the opening of the airport, as well as deaths on both sides. At its height, the union mobilised 17,500 people for a general rally, while thousands of riot police were brought in on several occasions.  Regional history  Horses at Gory≈ç Farm in 1930 The northern region of Chiba Prefecture had been farmland since , when the emperor ordered the creation of horse and cattle pastures there. The Shim≈çsa Plateau, which covers most of the northern part of the prefecture, had been active in agriculture for centuries. Villages conducting agricultural work in the region since the Edo period were called koson (Âè§Êùë, \\"old village\\"). Edo imperial magistrates' jurisdiction did not reach these villages, which is said to have fostered defiance of political authority as a feature of the region. Farmers' movements, unions, and strikes thrived here above anywhere else in the prefecture. In the early 20th century, the area became the imperial family's farmlands, known as Gory≈ç Farm (Âæ°ÊñôÁâßÂ†¥, goryou bokuj≈ç). Locals became familiar with the imperial family, who frequently came to visit their stables. The Gory≈ç Farm was emotionally and economically indispensable to locals, with some residents saying this contributed to local opposition to the airport: \\"Hearing that the Gory≈ç Farm would disappear [as a result of the construction] made everyone around here go crazy.\\" In 1923, of the Gory≈ç Farm were sold, leading to the development of small villages throughout the Meiji and Taish≈ç periods. This land was cultivated by former lower-class samurai, servants of samurai families, and others who lost their livelihoods to the Meiji Restoration. Many could not cope with the hardships of land-clearing work and abandoned the area. The farmers who remained later won a long judicial struggle to secure their own rights to the land from wealthy Tokyo merchants who held land-bonds. In 1946, after Japanese defeat in WWII, large tracts of imperial-owned land were again sold off. The various disadvantaged peoples who settled this land were collectively called \\"the new poor\\" (Êñ∞Á™ÆÊ∞ë shin-kyuumin). They performed heavy agricultural labour day and night, living in straw huts without electricity or running water. Settlers who could not endure this harsh environment left; those who remained were able to make a living off of land purchased from deserters. Because of these histories, this region's farmers had a very strong attachment to their lands.  Origins of the struggle  Blueprint for the New Tokyo International Airport (1964)  Aviation demand and plans for a new airport  In the 1960s, Japanese aviation demands were dramatically increasing with its rapid economic growth. It was predicted that Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport) would reach capacity by 1970. For many logistical reasons, expanding Haneda was not an option. Instead, the Ikeda cabinet began planning a second international airport, making a formal cabinet decision on 16 November 1962. In June 1963, the Ministry of Transport drew up plans for the \\"New Tokyo International Airport\\" which envisioned an airport spanning about . Areas considered for the site included Tomisato, Yachimata, and several other villages in Chiba Prefecture and Ibaraki Prefecture. In December 1963, the Aviation Council report to Minister of Transport recommended the Tomisato area, making no reference to the issue of land acquisition. On 18 November 1965, Eisaku Sat≈ç's cabinet made an informal tentative decision to construct the airport in Tomisato, which Chief Cabinet Secretary unexpectedly announced at a press conference. The planned airport's area equaled half of Tomisato, and its construction would mean the disappearance of many farming villages. Additionally, because aircraft usage at the time was not yet common among the general public, people considered airports to be disruptions that burdened their surrounding environments with noise pollution and other issues. Opposition movements had already risen in each of the potential construction sites, such as the Tomisato-Yachimata Anti- Airport Union formed in 1963. Local farmers expressed outrage at the one-sided nature of the decision and allied with opposition parties (Japanese Communist Party and Social Democratic Party of Japan). There was also resistance by local public bodies who had not been informed of the developments, leading to temporary suspension of the cabinet decision.  Reassignment to the Sanrizuka site  In 1966, the opposition movement showed no signs of waning. Fearing that the airport construction would be forced to a standstill, the Sat≈ç cabinet negotiated secretly with transport vice minister Tokuji Wakasa, Chiba Prefectural Mayor , and Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vice-President . They decided to reassign the construction site 4 kilometres (2.4 mi) north- east, to state-owned land on Gory≈ç Farm, to minimise private land acquisition. They also expected that with Sanrizuka's impoverished farming communities, construction would be possible so long as adequate compensation was provided. However, the Ministry of Transport considered the Tomisato plan ideal and the Sanrizuka plan a fallback. On 21 June 1966, after the switch to the Sanrizuka plan had already been agreed between the government and the prefecture, Transport Minister told a press conference, \\"There is nowhere for the airport but Tomisato/Yachimata.\\" The following day, Prime Minister Sat≈ç held a broadcast conference with Mayor Tomon≈ç regarding the Sanrizuka plan. This time the decision had been made after co-ordination with prefectural officials, but without consulting locals. Consequently, Sanrizuka and Shibayama residents were shocked to learn of the decision from the broadcast, and furious opposition broke out as it had in Tomisato. Tomisato organisers hurried to Sanrizuka to encourage frustrated residents that resistance was possible. On 4 July, the Sat≈ç cabinet, wishing to hurry the opening of the airport, made another cabinet decision for the new airport construction. This plan also required a vast expanse of land of which Gory≈ç farmland constituted less than 40%, again making the acquisition of citizen-owned land a major issue. According to the Transport Minister's instructions in December 1966, the goal was to build the airport in two phases and begin operating the first half by spring 1971, with the remainder to be completed by the end of 1973.  Organisation of opposition   Formation of the anti-airport union  There was nearly unanimous opposition in the region to the cabinet decision. In July or August 1966, the Sanrizuka-Shibayama Joint Anti-Airport Union was formed. The government was eventually able to secure land from many residents who conceded for social or financial reasons. To acquire the rest, the government employed both hard and soft measures, but the opposition persisted. Beginning in August 1966, the union led a campaign to purchase single plots of land within the designated construction site. Also that month, Mayor Tomon≈ç communicated intent to have on-site investigations performed on the construction site. The opposition responded with demonstrations, Sit-ins, and petitions, none of which succeeded. Many appeals were made to LDP leaders, who had a wide following among the opposition, but they persisted in support of the airport. Early on 10 October, airport corporation members protected by approximately 1,500 riot police arrived to install surveying piles. The opposition attempted to block the road with a sit-in, but under the pretence of traffic-law violations they were violently removed by riot police. The airport corporation set up three pile drivers on-site, and afterwards called this a breakthrough toward the construction.  Involvement of other political groups  In 1967, the Japanese student movement was on the rise, and the union hoped to cooperate with students who had clashed with riot police in protests against the US‚ÄìJapan Security Treaty, taking the stance that they would \\"accept support without regard for political faction\\". Supported by various left-wing groups, the union held sit-ins, seized and destroyed surveying equipment from airport corporation employees, erected barricades, threw stones, and harassed airport affiliates. They were generally successful in mobilising armed struggle against the government. However, antagonism developed between parties, creating differing perceptions among union members of their relationship to leftist parties and eventually leading to splits.  Intensification of the struggle  From April to July 1968, the airport corporation ran a survey of the real estate of residents who had agreed to give up their land. Both leftist parties and farmers had opposed with physical resistance, resulting in damage to many houses and fields. On 18 August 1969, the Gory≈ç Farm's closing ceremony was held. The union attended in protest, and the youth division destroyed the assembly hall, putting their leader on the police's nationwide wanted list. The police became tougher on the opposition, arresting union leader and thirteen others in November 1969 for occupying a road and stopping a bulldozer. With these struggles, peaceful acquisition of land was thought impossible, and the airport corporation used state power to forcibly expropriate the remaining necessary land. In 1970, it carried out an on-site survey on yet-unpurchased land. Opposition members threw raw sewage, Chloropicrin, and stones, and fought with sickles and bamboo spears. They also constructed fortifications on the land, some of them underground. On 22 February 1971, the government enacted the first administrative subrogation and the opposition supporters clashed with construction workers and riot police. The forts were demolished. On 16 September 1971, the second subrogation was enacted. Three police officers were killed by rioters on this dayÔºàÔºâ. Four days later, riot police and construction workers arrived on-site to remove an elderly woman, Yone Koizumi, and demolish her house. This incident was held as an example of the state throwing lives into turmoil, and became a symbol for the continuing opposition struggle. The tower built on the construction site by opposition members On 1 October 1971, Fumio Sannomiya, a central member of the youth division, committed suicide, leaving a note that said, \\"I detest those who brought the airport to this land\\" and \\"I have lost the will to keep fighting.\\" Additional conflicts in 1971 led to the deaths of three riot police, with multiple injuries on both sides. In March 1972, the union constructed a 60.6-metre (200 ft) tower within Runway A's approach area, obstructing flight tests. Opposition activity also halted the construction of a jet fuel pipeline from the Port of Chiba. Facility construction was able to proceed, but the opening continued to be delayed. The opposition union had also received a blow from mass arrests at the anti-subrogation struggle, with its initial membership of 320 households falling to 45, then to 23 by 1976. Footage of the incidents appeared in the film Days of Fury (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price.  Opening of the airport  In January 1977, the Fukuda cabinet proclaimed that the airport would open within the year. On 17 April the opposition mobilised 17,500 people ‚Äî an all-time record for the struggle ‚Äî and held a general rally against the airport in a Sanrizuka public park. In May 1977, the airport corporation submitted an injunction request for the demolition of the tower to the prefectural court, which was accepted. On 6 May, 2,100 riot police gained control of the tower and surrounding area. Protesters were removed and the tower demolished. Clashes between opposition and riot police continued, and on 8 May a large-scale conflict broke out. One protester sustained a direct blow to the head from a tear gas bomb, lost consciousness, and died two days later. The deceased's parents sued the government and prefecture for million in damages. On 9 May, in an attack considered revenge for this incident, one police officer died. Meanwhile, first-phase construction continued, and the airport was scheduled to open for operation with one runway on 30 March 1978. However, on 26 March, several left-wing groups raided the airport, occupying a control tower and destroying equipment and facilities. Further delays became inevitable, and the government enacted new disciplinary laws while increasing airport security. On 20 May, two months later, the New Tokyo International Airport was completed despite ongoing opposition. At this time, 17 farming households remained on the unfinished second-phase land, of which 15 belonged to the union.  Continued opposition  With the opening of the airport, the union's slogan was changed from \\"Certain Prevention of the Airport\\" to \\"Airport Abolition / Stop Second Phase Construction\\". Issaku Tomura, the leader and psychological pillar of the union, soon died of illness, and combined with the reality of the airport's success, this led many union participants to withdraw. Over time, the union's previous supporters ‚Äì leftist and student groups ‚Äì came to take charge. Authorities thought it impossible to protect the airport from militant attacks while also acquiring the second-phase land, leading to behind-the-scenes negotiations between government and union members. However, negotiations failed after being leaked to the media, resulting in harassment of union leaders and the union dissolving into chaos. Destructive action against the airport continued from splinter groups, with over 511 incidents of guerrilla action recorded between 1978 and 2017.

The group's mission statement is: ‚ÄúTo inspire and advance manatee conservation by partnering cooperatively in manatee rescue, rehabilitation, release, and monitoring efforts; improve understanding of manatee biology and health through scientific research; and promote stewardship and financial support through public education.‚Äù  History  A Florida manatee The Manatee Rehabilitation Partnership was founded in the early 2000s to fund and direct post-release monitoring efforts of Florida manatees, which were designated by the federal endangered species list as ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù.. At the time, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service managed manatee rescue efforts, rehabilitation, and releases, while the Manatee Rehabilitation Partnership participated in the monitoring efforts. A group of experts working for the Wildlife Trust conducted the initial tagging and tracking. In 2012, USFWS reduced its involvement in the day-to-day management of manatees to an advisory capacity only. Workshops were held with manatee rescue and rehabilitation stakeholders to plan and create a new organization that would perform the tasks that the USFWS had done before. This resulted in the replacement of the Manatee Rehbilitation Partnership with the Manatee Rescue & Rehabilitation Partnership (MRP). Representing its individual member organizations, the MRP acted as a self-governing entity for overseeing rescue, rehabilitation, release, and monitoring of Florida manatees. Most of the organizations and experts that had participated in the Manatee Rehabilitation Partnership joined the new organization, with several more recent ones joining as well.  Functions  The MRP coordinates the rescuing, rehabilitating, releasing, and monitoring of sick or injured Florida manatees, with help from the Florida Wildlife Commission and other program partners. Sick or injured manatees are placed in acute care rehabilitation, which treat the manatees until they have recovered. The current acute care facilities include SeaWorld Orlando, ZooTampa, Miami Seaquarium, Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens, and Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park. When animals are stable and no longer receiving medical care, they are sometimes housed in secondary holding facilities to gain weight and await appropriate conditions for release back into the wild. The current second stage facilities include The Parker Manatee Rehabilitation Habitat at The Bishop Museum of Science and Nature, The Seas at EPCOT, Cincinnati Zoo, and Columbus Zoo. Veterinary experts monitor the health of the manatees during all phases of the program to give the manatees the best chance of survival. When an animal is ready for release, their information is provided to the release committee who coordinates the logistics of releasing each manatee. Manatees with little experience of surviving in the wild are tagged with satellite tags and monitored for a period of one year to guarantee that they are capable of surviving in the wild.  Structure and budget The member organizations of the MRP elect its officers, who include the chairman and co-chairman of the organization, as well as organizational subcommittees, which each have a chairman or co-chairs. The current subcommittees include Rescue/Rehabilitation, Release, Monitoring, Veterinary, and Education/Outreach. Working groups can be created at the discretion of the chairs to address particular issues needing extra attention. Biannual meetings are held of the entire membership, which includes SeaWorld Orlando, Miami Seaquarium, Walt Disney World, Columbus Zoo, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Sea2Shore Alliance, Mote Marine Laboratory, Save the Manatee Club, Pittsburgh Zoo, and Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Because it is a self governing entity, the MRP requires participation from all of its members to ensure agreement and function efficiently. The budget of the MRP is funded almost entirely by the state of Florida though the Save the Manatee Trust Fund, in addition to minor contributions from the USFWS. Other member organizations of the MRP donate their services to the organization by treating and housing the manatees. It is very expensive to track and monitor manatees post-release, so this function has historically made up the bulk of the MRP's operating expenses. An increase in the number of manatees requiring tracking in recent years has strained the resources of the MRP, causing the organization to seek additional outside funding.

In 2018 she won the Oka Sho, Yushun Himba and Shuka Sho to complete the Japanese Fillies' Triple Crown. In November she ended an unbeaten season with a record-breaking win in the Japan Cup. On her first run of 2019 she won the Dubai Turf and went on to take the Tenno Sho in autumn. She holds a world record over 2,400 meters on turf. Almond Eye is the highest earning racehorse in the world among the racehorses born in 2015. Background Almond Eye is a bay filly bred in Japan by Northern Racing and owned by Silk Racing. She was sent into training with Sakae Kunieda. Almond Eye usually races in a hood and a shadow roll. Almond Eye was from the first crop of foals sired by Lord Kanaloa, an outstanding sprinter-miler who was voted Japanese Horse of the Year in 2013. Her dam Fusaichi Pandora was a top-class racemare who won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup in 2006. She was descendant of the influential American broodmare Best In Show, the ancestor of numerous major winners including El Gran Senor, Try My Best, Xaar, Jazil, Rags to Riches and Redoute's Choice. Racing career 2017: two-year-old season Almond Eye made her racecourse debut in a newcomers' race over 1400 metres at Niigata Racecourse on 6 August and finished second to Nishino Urara. Two month later at Tokyo Racecourse she recorded her first success in a 1600 metres maiden race winning by three lengths from Cosmo Feerique. 2018: three-year-old season Spring and summer On 8 January Almond Eye was ridden by Keita Tosaki when she started the 1.9/1 favourite for the Grade 3 Shinzan Kinen over 1600 metres at Kyoto Racecourse and won by one and three quarter lengths from Tsuzumimon. Christophe Lemaire took the ride when Almond Eye returned to the track for the Grade 1 Oka Sho over 1600 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 8 April. She started the 2.9/1 second favourite behind the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies winner Lucky Lilac with the best fancied of the other fifteen runners being Lily Noble, Mau Lea and Finift. After racing towards the rear of the field the filly produced a strong late run in the straight, took the lead in the last 100 metres and won by one and three quarter length from Lucky Lilac in a race record time of 1:33.1. Lemaire commented \\"Her response and speed at the stretch was unbelievable and felt great! Her strides kept getting bigger and all I had to do was to keep her straight. A step up in distance shouldn‚Äôt be a problem for this talented filly who has great potentials to win the Triple Crown\\". On 20 May Almond Eye was stepped up in distance to contest the Yushun Himba over 2400 metres at Tokyo and started the 0.7/1 favourite ahead of Lucky Lilac, Lily Noble and Satono Walkure (Flora Stakes). Lemaire positioned the filly in mid division as the outsider Sayakachan set the pace, but then moved into contention entering the straight. Almond Eye produced a sustained run on the outside, took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and won by two lengths from Lily Noble. After the race Lemaire said \\"I had every confidence in her and race went perfectly for us. She was a little hyped up but we had a good start and in a good position. From there she settled in well and her turn of foot in the home straight was terrific. The stretch in distance was absolutely no problem for her. She is one special filly with great potentials and fit to face international competition if she has the chance\\". Autumn Almond Eye wins the Shuka Sho After an absence of well over four months, Almond Eye returned for the Shuka Sho over 2000 metres at Kyoto as she attempted to become the fifth horse to complete the Japanese Triple Crown for fillies. Before the race Kunieda explained \\"She has improved a lot and she‚Äôs tracking very well. Her hind hooves are hitting her front hooves a bit but much less than they were. She went all out in the Oaks and she was a bit tired after that. Over the summer, she matured physically and mentally and has returned to work looking good. She gained more than 10kg over the summer but you can see that she has added muscle\\". She was made the 0.3/1 favourite ahead of her old rival Lucky Lilac (6.3/1) with the only others in the seventeen-runner field to start at less than 20/1 being Cantabile (Rose Stakes) and Mikki Charm. Lemaire positioned the favourite towards the rear as Mikki Charm set the pace, but then switched to the wide outside exiting the final turn. Almond Eye produced her customary late charge, caught Mikki Charm in the final strides and won by one and a half length. Lemaire commented \\"I was a bit worried today because Almond Eye was rather nervous and highly strung than usual, so the start wasn‚Äôt that good, then our path was blocked and we had to go wide, but from there she just showed just how exceptional she was. She‚Äôs such a fantastic filly\\". On 25 November the filly was matched against male opposition to contest the 38th running of the Japan Cup over 2400 metres at Tokyo in which he was partnered Lemaire and started the odds-on favourite. In the build-up to the race Kunieda said \\"She did seem a bit lightheaded after the [Shuka Sho] and she ran a temperature for a bit but quickly recovered. She looks leaner than she did before her last race, but she‚Äôs relaxed and her responses are good\\". Her thirteen opponents included Cheval Grand (winner of the race in 2018), Satono Diamond, Satono Crown, Capri, Suave Richard and Kiseki (Kikuka Sho). After tracking the front-runners the filly turned into the straight in second place behind Kiseki, who had set a very strong pace. She moved up alongside Kiseki 200 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by one and three quarter lengths with a gap of three and a half lengths back to Suave Richard in third. The winning time of 2:20.6 broke the existing race record by 1.5 seconds. Lemaire commented \\"Today I was a little bit anxious, but I think we saw the best Almond Eye in the race and it was a great show... This is a very special filly as I keep telling the press in Japan that she is ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù ‚Äìher ability, temperament, she can adapt and race from any position\\". The winning time of 2:20.6 is a world record over 2,400 meters on turf. In January 2019 Almond Eye was unanimously voted Japanese Horse of the Year and Best Three-Year-Old Filly at the JRA Awards for 2018. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Almond Eye was rated the best three-year-old filly in the world (level with Alpha Centauri) and the eleventh best horse of any age or sex. 2019: four-year- old season For her first race as a four-year-old, Almond Eye was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Turf over 1800 metres at Meydan Racecourse on 30 March. With Lemaire in the saddle she started the 6/5 favourite in a thirteen-runner field which included Dream Castle (Jebel Hatta), Vivlos, Without Parole and Deirdre. After racing in mid-division, Almond Eye made rapid progress in the straight, took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from Vivlos, with the British gelding Lord Glitters half a length away in third. Lemaire commented \\"Down the stretch when I pulled her out, she used her powerful stride as usual. She was very relaxed but the thing was, we took the lead a little bit soon and so I think she relaxed a little bit in the last few yards... We did a good job today, it was beautiful, I think everyone enjoyed seeing such a good horse on the track\\". The filly was then brought back in distance for the 1600 metre Yasuda Kinen over 1600 metres on 2 June and was made the 7/10 favourite. After failing to obtain a good racing position from a wide draw Almond Eye was repeatedly denied a clear run until the last 300 metres and despite launching a powerful late run she failed by a head and a nose to catch Indy Champ and Aerolithe.

After settling in sixth place Almond Eye accelerated up the inside rail in the straight, took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and drew away to win by three lengths from Danon Premium. Lemaire said \\"She was well rested after a long break and showed her true strength today. We were able to follow Aerolithe and Saturnalia in a good position, found a good opening on the rails and she just stretched beautifully from there.\\" On her final run of the year Almond Eye started odds on favourite for the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 22 December. She raced towards the outside for most of the way and moved up to dispute the lead early in the straight but was soon under pressure and dropped out of contention to finish ninth behind Lys Gracieux. After the race Lemaire said \\"She was physically fit and in good condition but she couldn‚Äôt keep her calm before the crowd in the first lap and lost her rhythm. She was unable to relax and was tired\\". Almond Eye is the highest earning racehorse in the world among the racehorses born in 2015.

She has been a clothing designer, performer, film producer, and restaurateur, and is the wife, muse and creative accomplice of fashion designer Rick Owens. Early life and education Mich√®le Lamy was born in 1944 in Jura, France, into an Algerian family with a background in the fashion industry. Her grandfather made accessories for one of France's most famous couturiers, Paul Poiret. She studied law, and during the 60s and 70s, worked as a defense lawyer, while studying with the postmodern philosopher Gilles Deleuze. She was involved in the May 1968 protests in Paris. She then worked as a cabaret dancer and toured France before moving to the United States in 1979. Career In 1979, Lamy moved to New York and then settled in Los Angeles, where she set up a fashion line and ran two cult restaurants/nightclubs ‚Äì Caf√© des Artistes and Les Deux Caf√©s in 1996 with her first husband, experimental filmmaker Richard Newton. With her tattooed fingers and gold-plated teeth, she was an emblematic figure of nightlife in Los Angeles in the middle of 90s. Her tattoos were inspired by the Berbers, during her first trip to North Africa when she was around 17 or 18 years old. In 1990, Lamy created a clothing line called Lamy. She hired Rick Owens, who later became her business partner and, then, her companion and husband. In 2003, Lamy and Owens left Los Angeles to settle in Paris and got married in 2006. In 2004, the couple established their own fashion company Owenscorp, describing their business partnership as ‚Äúasking a gypsy to organise a war with a fascist.‚Äù A muse and collaborator, Lamy shares responsibility for the expansion of Owens brand, as well as that of their prot√©g√©; Gareth Pugh. Lamy also produces the furniture that bears the Owens name. She also designs jewelry with Loree Rodkin and has appeared in FKA twigs and Black Asteroid music videos. She formed the band LAVASCAR with the artist Nico Vascellari and her daughter Scarlett Rouge. In November 2010, Lamy posed for a shoot for Vogue Paris with the photographer Steven Klein. In 2013, Lamy was featured in Forbes with her daughter from her first marriage, artist Scarlett Rouge. In 2015, she was featured in one of the videos for the EP M3LL155X by FKA Twigs. Lamy appeared in the first clip; Figure 8, wearing a headpiece with a luminous bulb imitating an anglerfish. At the 2016 Venice Biennale, Lamy transformed an old container ship into a floating saloon. The same year, she recorded songs with her good friend, rapper A$AP Rocky. Rocky said about Lamy, \\"Hardly anyone knows how important you have been behind the scenes for my career. You did not just design my album covers, you took me to art fairs and showed me the art world.\\" In 2017, Lamy and Rick Owens were featured in Lou Stoppard's book about fashion‚Äôs most important and iconic duos, titled Fashion Together: Fashion‚Äôs Most Extraordinary Duos on the Art of Collaboration. In the book, Owens said that Lamy was more his \\"mate\\" than \\"muse.\\" And, \\"I don‚Äôt think anyone would ever think of Mich√®le as a passive muse. I think that‚Äôs why she sparks people‚Äôs interest‚Äîbecause she doesn‚Äôt fit the typical role of a muse.\\" Lamy has practiced boxing for 35 years. In 2018, she set up her own boxing gym \\"Lamyland\\" in Selfridges, London. The space previously was home to A$AP Rocky‚Äôs AWGE Bodega. It is now reinvented every few months.

The Red River is one of the mythological rivers said to flow from Kunlun, a mythological land, with mountainous features. Translations into English include \\"Scarlet River\\". Mythical geography Oil lamp depicting the Queen of the West in her Heavenly Paradise together with relevant mythological geography and beings. Eastern Han ceramic unearthed at Chengdu, China. Chinese mythology and imagination developed an extensive collection of ideas related to a mythical geography. Put together, these could form a picture of an exotic land usually thought to be located somewhere \\"in the west\\". Sometimes, as the areas to the west were charted, real geographical features would be named for mythological ones. It is also possible that the reverse process also occurred, as stories or legends formed from actual geographic phenomena were incorporated into mythical geography. Nearby features Various mythological geography is associated with the Red River, including one or more of the eight mountain pillars, especially the (mythological) Kunlun Mountain, the Weak River, the Black River, and intervening terrain, such as the Moving Sands. Jade Mountain was also in the vicinity (Yang 2005: 160-162). Ideas As the mythology of the Red River and related mythical geography developed, it was influenced by ideas from the cosmology of India related to Mount Sumeru as an axis mundi, together with related cosmological features, such as rivers (Christie 1968:74). India was the goal of the Buddhist priest Xuanzang and his companions in the Journey to the West, in which India became part of a fictional geography, as well as all the land between it and Tang China (Yu 1977, passim).  Poetry  The Red River is an allusion in various Chinese Classical poems, the early Chuci anthology included. Pulled through the sky by a team of dragons, Qu Yuan soars above all obstacle rivers and hostile terrain at will during his spirit journey as described in his poem \\"Li Sao\\". The Li Sao helped set the tone for other poems of the Chuci, which also allude to this type of mythical geography. In the \\"Li Sao\\", Qu Yuan, on a spiritual journey, which he describes as being pulled in a chariot by winged dragons, leaves the Ford of Heaven in the morning and reaches Kunlun by nightfall. On the way, in line 350 of the \\"Li Sao\\" (according to David Hawkes' line numbering), Qu Yuan comes to the banks of the Red Water (or River). This is one of the colored rivers flowing from Kunlun. Qu Yuan encounters this right after reaching the Moving Sands (Hawkes 1985, 78, 94 and 334). Qu Yuan then surmounts the Red Water, or River, by summoning water dragons to make a bridge, then being conducted across by a Deity of the West (lines 351-352). Western Paradise Queen of the West in her paradise. Eastern Han ceramic tomb tile. Unearthed at Chengdu, China. The Red River was often thought to flow from Kunlun, sometimes located in the south seas area and sometimes considered to be the focal point of a Western Paradise. It is sometimes said that this Paradise was presided over by Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of Meng Hao in the West, in later accounts was relocated to a palace protected by golden ramparts, within which immortals (xian) would feast (Christie 1968: 78-79), and inhabited by various other exotic beings, such as Wu or shamans, who were conceived of as people that practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing: they specialized in traveling by spirit flight, induced through the usual shamanic means. Shanhaijing The Shanhaijing forms an interesting intersection between Red Water/Red River mythology and geography, because it the borderline between what is based on reality and what is purely imaginary is unclear in this book. The Shanhaijing discusses the Red River in chapter 16 (Yang 2005, 162). Real Red Rivers A real Red River, in what is now Vietnam Red River in Yuanyang County, Yunnan Yangzi at First Bridge \\"Boats on the Red River Wharf\\" by ƒê·ªó-ƒë·ª©c-Thu·∫≠n, a painting of boats on a real Red River There are various modern rivers, or parts of rivers, in modern China known by a name meaning \\"Red River\\". In ancient times, the sources of these rivers often were not known by people down stream, and they often created mythological explanations for the sources of these rivers, such as mythological rivers flowing from \\"Kunlun\\". For example, the official source of the longest river in Asia: the Yangzi (\\"Yangtze\\", in older versions) main head water source is what is sometimes known in Mongolian as Ulaan M√∂r√∂n, meaning \\"Red River\\" (it is also known by other names, such as the Tuotuo River). It is worth noting that the use of \\"Yanngzi\\" to refer to the whole river is relatively recent, classically and in ancient times, this was only used to describe the lower reaches, with other names used for the upper stretches. Another of Asia's major rivers is also named the Red River (; ). With a source in the Hengduan Mountains, it flows into the ocean through northern Vietnam. The study of the relationship between real rivers and mythological rivers is complicated by the various name changes or variations in names for the real rivers over time, including often interchangeable Chinese characters for \\"water\\", \\"river\\", or \\"stream\\". Although the relationship between real and mythological geography such as rivers is not always clear, but one open to further study.

He is best known for his part in what historian of religion Ioan Culianu called \\"one of the most famous cases of demonic possession in the seventeenth century\\" where, in 1618, a young widow of Nancy, France, Elisabeth de Ranfaing, fell into the hands of the local doctor, Charles Poirot, who allegedly proceeded to violate her and give her medicine - intending to cause demonic possession. Pithoys was called to perform an exorcism but refused and instead wrote his Descouverture des faux possedez (1621) where he attacked the doctor's evidence against Elisabeth and the doctor himself, claiming he had drugged her into convulsions and insanity - simulating demonic possession. This was displeasing towards the local clergy and so a less skeptical doctor, Remy Pichard, was brought in to exorcise Ranfaing. The doctor was subsequently burned at the stake in 1622 and Elisabeth was fully exorcised in 1625, founding a religious order in later life. This tale has been argued to be apocryphal in Jean Lhermitte and √âtienne Delcambre's assessment, being that the effect of the doctor's drug would be unlikely to persist for the seven years in which Elisabeth was possessed and that Elisabeth would likely have been trying to escape her parents, and join French religious life. He is also well known for his skepticism towards superstition and exorcism, something uncommon for his time.Pithoys, p. xv- xviWhitmore, p.132-129 He questioned the validity of many popular superstitions but, according to philosopher Brian Copenhaver, \\"such questioning was rare, alien to the zealots and undeveloped in aspiring rationalists\\".

It was produced, lensed and directed by Joe D'Amato. The film is most notable for being the first Italian hardcore pornographic film to be shown in Italian theatres, and one in a series of four hardcore pornographic films D'Amato shot back-to-back in the second half of 1979 in the Dominican Republic, the others being the porn/horror crossover films Erotic Nights of the Living Dead and Porno Holocaust, and the pornographic thriller Hard Sensation. Although Sesso Nero was the last one of these films to be shot, it was the first to be distributed and shown in Italian theatres. The film is also notable for its thematic richness unusual for the genre, including the theme of illness, voodoo haunting, and the final gory scene of self- castration. It has been called the best film of early Italian hardcore film production by experts on the subject and has become a cult film.  Plot  New York businessman Mark Lester is diagnosed with a hypertrophy of the prostate requiring surgery in two weeks according to his doctor, who hands him a syringe and medication against the pain. Mark does not to tell his wife, deciding to use the time to return to Santo Domingo, where 12 years ago he met Maira, the woman of his life. At the island airport, Mark meets his old friend Jacques who has reserved a room for him at the Sheraton. Jacques tells Mark that Maira really loved him and would have followed him but was too poor to do so. When Maira disappeared, her father, an old voodoo magician, left his house to stay at Boca de Yuma, a wild place at the other side of the island, together with his little daughter. While Mark is dreaming of his upcoming surgery in his room, a hotel maid masturbates, looking at his exposed penis. When he wakes up, he has sex with her. In a call home, he learns his wife is drunk. Later, walking the streets, he sees Maira's reflection in a shopping window, looking at him. She appears unchanged by time. At Jacques', Mark meets Lucia, whom Jacques rescued from prostitution when she was 15. Lucia had the idea of founding a school, but they need funding. In Jacques' absence, Mark says he is nauseated by their kindness, talks about perhaps providing the funding himself, and asks Lucia to do as she did with 15. Disgusted, she performs oral sex on him \\"for Jacques\\". Later, Mark is in genital pain, and Jacques accompanies him to the hotel, where Mark injects himself with the painkiller. Jacques tells him to stay away from himself and Lucia. In the streets, Mark spots Maira again. She addresses him, saying it was his return that makes her appearance possible. When Mark is forced to grope his groin in pain, she vanishes. At night, Mark meets his friend Voyakis, now owner of a successful nightclub. Mark tells him about once seeing a voodoo magician performing a strange rite after a car accident: He collected the soul in a bottle, and people said that if he opened it again, the soul would return again. Watching the gay dancer and his female partner dance to the music of \\"Sexy Night\\", Mark hallucinates her being Maira and experiences another fit of genital pain. The next day, he goes to Boca di Yuma and meets Maira's father at the beach. He tells him that he collected her last breath in the bottle. She carried his name on her lips, cursing him. He also tells him he will never leave and that his illness will become stronger until he dies. She will not let him leave, and he will stay forever. When Mark asks him whether she is alive, he tells him she died long ago, but that for him she is alive until he too will live. In his glass bottle, he keeps her soul so that no evil spirit can disturb her eternal sleep. When Mark's wife Liza arrives, he is asleep. She undresses, and wakes him up. She wants him to return with her for surgery. They talk about her sterility and his impending castration. When she mentions that she bought him with her money, Mark slaps her so she is flung onto the bed, which causes his erection and he penetrates her from behind. Later, Mark receives a message from Maira and goes off to meet her on the beach where he remembers having sex with her back then. He meets her there and can feel the warmth of her skin, proving to himself it is not just a mad dream. He still desires her more than anything. She, however, is reproachful of his arrogant and destructive possessiveness and accuses him of having broken his promises and leaving her. She drugs him with a rare herb called \\"Mexican mushroom\\", then performs oral sex on an approaching black local while he is watching, immobilized by the drug. Liza, realising Mark has left her without even a message, books a flight back for the next day. At the airport, a man tells her that her husband will die if she leaves. In the meantime, Mark hides in a dark hotel room getting drunk and sees Maira and the overweight hotel owner having sex with two black men. Liza, after having looked for Mark in vain, visits Jacques, who locates him for her with a brief phone call. In return, he wants to get back what was taken from him, having sex with Liza while Lucia is watching, pleasuring herself. Mark, after injecting a high dose of painkiller, hallucinates about his surgery and about having sex with Lucia on the beach. He runs a temperature, and Maira comes to visit him in his room, wanting to take care of him, but leaving him again. In a fit of madness, Mark stabs the owner, accusing her of having defiled Maira. Jacques and Liza see Maira leaving the brothel and enter to find the body, and a man tells them that \\"Maira\\" is not the Maira of old, but her 10-year younger sister who the father has brought up magically in Maira's memory and physical likeness, to avenge her death, knowing that Mark would eventually come back. Mark meets \\"Maira\\" on the beach. While they are having sex, she reveals that she is not who he thinks she is, and that he needs to die to avenge Maira's death. Mark walks away towards the sea, kneels down, and cuts off his own penis with a knife, his blood spurting and mixing with the foam. He dies. \\"Maira\\" sits down next to him and caresses him. When Jacques and Lisa find his body there, Jacques says, \\"That was what Mark wanted. He only wanted to kill himself.\\"  Cast  *Mark Shannon as Mark Lester *Annj Goren as Maira and her younger sister *George Eastman as Voyakis Uncredited: *Lucia Ramirez as Lucia *George Du Bren as Jacques De La Penne *Chantal Kubel as chambermaid at the hotel *Lola Burdan as Liza Lester, Mark's wife *Lanfranco Spinola as Paul, the doctor *Sandy Samuel as dancer at Voyakis' restaurant *Fernando Arcangeli as dancer *Erminio Bianchi Fasani as customer at Voyakis' restaurant *Pino Marocco as customer at Voyakis' restaurant *Bruno Alias as customer at Voyakis' restaurant  Production  Sesso nero was the last of nine films D'Amato shot in the Dominican Republic in 1978 and 1979. The idea for the film came from George Eastman, who after losing all his money to gambling proposed to D'Amato to write the story and screenplay of a film in a single day, in exchange for a million lire. D'Amato accepted the proposal since the actors, the technicians and the locations of the previous films were still in place and ready to use. In the official documentation, it is recorded that the production company changed from Fulvia Cin.ca to P.C.M. during the shoot, the latter being Produzioni Cinematografiche Massaccesi, the company founded by D'Amato, for whom this was the first of many films he produced on his own. Actor and screenwriter George Eastman remembers that the budget was 20 million lire. Shooting began on November 12, 1979. The working titles were Amore ai tropici (literally: \\"Love in the tropics\\") and Much more. The film was shot on location in and around Santo Domingo.  Release  Censorship The film was first presented to the board of censorship on March 12, 1980 under its title Much more, but was subsequently withdrawn and presented again under its definitive title Sesso nero, under which it passed on May 30, 1980. No cuts were imposed. Theatrical releases In Italy, the film premiered at the cinema \\"Torino\\" in Turin on July 1, 1980, in Milan on July 18, and in Rome on July 30. The film's gross was 54.122.000 lire with 21.670 spectators in 8 cities and 62 days. In France, the film passed the board on October 2, 1980 and was distributed to Parisian cinemas in May 1981 under the title Exotic love. In Spain, it passed on March 7, 1984 and was shown in May 1984 to 55.585 spectators under the title Sexo negro. Home video In Italy, the film was released in a softcore version as Foemina (La femmina) by \\"Golden video\\" and \\"Broadcast\\", and hardcore as Sesso nero by \\"Cinevideosud\\" and \\"Shendene & Moizzi\\". On DVD, the hardcore version was released by \\"Stormovie\\". In Germany, the film's hardcore version was released on VHS by \\"Benra Kg\\" and on DVD as Orgasmo nero III. Schwarze Haut auf wei√üem Sand by \\"X-rated\\". In Greece, a shortened softcore version was released on DVD under the title Mavra kormia stin leuki ammo. In the United States, the hardcore version was released by \\"One 7 Movies\\" under the title Exotic Malice.  Reception  For Mondo Digital in 2011, Sesso nero \\"can't be classified as a traditional porn film since it clearly doesn't have the traditional raincoat brigade in mind\\". In their exhaustive 2014 monograph on early Italian hardcore film production (1980-1984), Andrea Napoli and Franco Grattarola both agreed on Sesso nero being the best and most beautiful film of the Italian \\"Golden Age\\" of adult filmmaking.

According to his family, on Friday, January 12, 2018, his death was reported to them after 11 days of his arrest by the Sanandaj Information Office. On January 13, his body was buried only in the presence of his parents.https://iran- hrm.com/index.php/2018/02/09/sarou-ghahremani/ It is said that Sarou was poisoned at the age of 18 as a political prisoner for a year and a half. Some media outlets in the Iranian government announced that he was a member of the Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan.  Family and friends remarks   Family  Sarou Ghahremani's family said that he had disappeared after taking part in the street protests in Sanandaj and had his body depopulated for burial after 11 days of his disappearance. A close friend of Ghahremani, on Saturday, January 13, quoted that Sarou's mother has mentioned that there were beating and whipping signs on Sarou's corp.prisoners The Iranian security forces have threatened Ghahremani's family that they have no rights to interview with any Medias. Sarou Ghahremani's mother, after her son's death, began to publish his photos of his lifetime by making an account on Instagram known as \\"Sarou, you‚Äôre mother's love\\". Mohammad Reza Arian, a retired police colonel and Sarou Ghahremani's aunt's husband, in a conversation with the Kayhan Newspaper of London, expresses that \\"Sanandaj governor speaks of a threat to a person or people with weapons, by Sarou on January 4. This is while Sarou was present in the city and among his family since the dawn of January 12 without any problems. If someone had filed a complaint against him, it would undoubtedly be in the coming days and in order for the police to proof the complaint, they should go to Sarou's home and approach his family. The governor of Sanandaj later argued that Sarou was killed in an armed conflict near the terminal. The retired colonel of the law enforcement agency has said that such an armed conflict has taken place inside the city and that no one has informed the citizens. Mohammad Reza Arian also referred to another young person, Kianoush Zand who was killed in the protests like Sarou Ghahremani. The existence of the numerous acts of torture and bruising on the body of Sarou without any marks on his body caused by armed conflict and shooting, made him ask that if Sarou was killed in an armed conflict on the evening of January 12, then why was his body returned to his family after 11 days? Did they wanted to interrogate a body during these eleven days? Mohammad Reza Arian, also claims about the twice summons of Mohammad Ghahremani, the father of Sarou Ghahremani to the Sanandaj Information Office and he added that he was forced to make television confessions with a predetermined text. He simultaneously reports the heavy presence of plainclothes and intelligence forces at Mohammad Ghahremani's home. On January 14, another close relative of Sarou's family said that after the delivery of the body was released, officers of the Ministry of Intelligence came and took Sarou's father with them, and a few hours later, the video of his interview was broadcast from Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. He mentioned that I don't know what they had said to him or threatened him with, but that video was a forced confession of a father against his son.  Friends  Also on January 14, 2018, when Sarou's death was released for the first time, actress Bahareh Rahnama, sharing a photo with Sarou Ghahremani, shared her sympathy with his family, saying that Sarou had been busy working in her restaurant since last year as a courier. Shortly after the actress's tweets in condemning the death of Sarou Ghahremani, she released tweets about herself being threaten by the Sanandaj governor.  Funeral  According to the follow-up committee of the arrests in January 2018, Sarou's body was handed over to his family by the security guards for burial, and only his parents were allowed to accompany the ambulance carriage to Beheshteh Mohammadiyeh Sanandaj for burial and other family members were not allowed to attend.  The Deceased  In the massive protests of Iran in January 2018, slogans were launched against Iran's internal and regional leaders and policies so according to the reports, more than 3,700 people have been arrested and at least 22 to 25 have been killed; but, so far till now, the identity of the deceased has not been announced. Officials of Iran have confirmed the death of 22-year-old Sina Ghanbari at Evin prison quarantine facility. The announcement of the death of Vahid Heidari in a detention center in Arak was also confirmed, while the cause of the death of both youngsters was announced by the Iranian government as suicidal acts. But this became the matter of their families protesting to clarify the causes of their deaths. Mohsen Adeli is also one of the victims of the January 2018 unrests in Dezful, who is said to have lost his life in the detention center in prison. But government officials said that he was shot in the street protests and lost his life when he got to the hospital.

According to the Gwangju Eupji () published in 1879, it was made of stone. It was 8253 in circumference and 9 (m?) in height.  Design  The castle had four gates: Seowon Gate on the east side, Gwangni Gate on the west, Jinnam Gate on the south and Gongbuk Gate on the north.  History  The first record of Gwangju Castle appears in the geography of Sejong Shilok, where it says 'Castle is built, it has a circumference of 972 steps', but no specific information (such as when the building was built) was given. However, because the fortress was built in Naju and Boseong in preparation for the invasion of the Joseon Dynasty, the city of Gwangju is presumed to have been built in the early 15th century.  Destruction  After the Korean Empire was established in 1897, Gwangju began to modernize. The government-owned buildings located in Gwangju during the period were used as post offices (passway through Seomun Tongan) and hospitals (Seo Gi-cheong). The Gwangju City Wall, which is believed to have been the center of Gwangju for at least 500 years, gradually disappeared. Most think that the Government-General of Korea began to demolish the wall in 1907, but some believe it had collapsed before that. The Hwangseong Sinmun, published on January 23, 1910, right before the Korea-Japan bombing, reported, \\"An observer of the province has filed an internal petition for the use of civil materials that tore up the walls and gate of Gwangju.\\" Numerous buildings in Gwangju Castle are believed to have been dismantled by the Japanese during this period.  Symbolism  Although nothing remains of Gwangju Castle, a reproduction of its stone wall is located at the National Asian Culture Hall in Gyeongju. This stone wall is a replica of the Jinnam Gate, the former south gate. The 999-kan, one of the Gwangju Folly, was originally located in Gongbuk-mun, a north gate, and the piece replaces the gate. The gate-shaped sculpture located in front of the old back gate of Jeonnam Girls' High School symbolizes Seowon Gate, the same gate. It is meant to symbolically receive the auspicious energy of the east. Gwangrimun Gate, the preface to the location of the work \\"Currentization of Memory,\\" is located in the middle of the Colbox intersection floor. The work appears to name the four gates along the outline of Castle. The word Gwangnimun means \\"to wish for all kinds of things\\" and \\"to the west of Gwangju and Gwangsan\\".

Its brightness varies with a period of 4.12 days, and has a typical brightness of magnitude 8.98 but decreasing down to a magnitude of 11.04 during the main eclipse. System The TW Andromedae system is made of two stars in a circular orbit around their center of mass, with an orbital plane almost parallel to our line of sight. The presence of a third body in the system, with a minimum mass of 0.27 and an orbital period of 49.6 years, has been proposed to account for the observed changes in the period of the variability. The radius of the two stars can be measured by looking at the eclipses. Beside that, little is known about the single stars, apart from their spectral types F0 and K0. Variability Like in all Algol variable stars, when both stars of the system are aligned with respect to our line of sight, the furthest component blocks the light of the other, thus the apparent luminosity of the system diminishes. When the brightest component eclipses the other, a secondary, less pronounced minimum in the luminosity occurs.

Introduced for the 2008 model year; the car was the same as its predecessor on the exterior but had undergone notable mechanical and interior changes.  History and development  Dodge Viper (ZB II) coup√© Interior For the 2008 model year, engine capacity was raised to which also resulted in power output being raised to at 6,100 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm. The engine was developed in collaboration with McLaren Automotive and Ricardo Consulting Engineers and included better flowing heads with larger valves, Mechadyne cam- in-cam variable valve timing on the exhaust cam lobes, and dual electronic throttle bodies. Other modifications included improved valvetrain stability from both the new camshaft profiles and valve-springcrankshaftssult of which the rev limit could be further extended by 300 rpm along with an Electronic engine control developed by Continental AG; the controller can monitor the crankshaft and cylinder position up to six times during each firing and has 10 times more processing power than the previous unit. No notable exterior changes were present on the new generation of the Viper except a vented engine cover. The Tremec T56 transmission was replaced with a new Tremec TR-6060 transmission with triple first-gear synchronizers and doubles for higher gears. The rear axle was also replaced and now had a GKN ViscoLok speed- sensing limited-slip differential that helped in attaining maximum grip for the tires. New Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised suspension system (springs, anti-roll bars, and shock valving). Another notable change was the reworked exhaust system; previous third-generation cars had their exhaust crossover under the seats which resulted in a large amount of heat going into the cockpit, which was done initially to help improve the car's exhaust note, since the first two generations of the Viper, which had no crossover, were criticized for their lackluster exhaust notes. There were also notable changes to the car's electrical system, including a 180-amp alternator, twin electric cooling fans, electronic throttle bodies, and completely new VENOM engine management system. CAN bus architecture had been combined with pre-existing systems to allow for regulatory compliance. The fuel system was upgraded to include a higher- capacity fuel pump and filtration system.  Variants   Viper SRT-10 ACR  Dodge Viper SRT-10 ACR The Viper SRT-10 ACR (American Club Racer) is a track-focused, performance-oriented variant of the Viper SRT-10. The intention was to combine Dodge's racing DNA into the road legal Viper to produce a car that was fast, agile and lightweight without compromising its normal driving identity. A carbon fiber front splitter, front canards and an adjustable carbon fiber rear wing made the car more responsive around corners and enabled it to generate of downforce at , distributed approximately 45 percent to the front and 55 percent to the rear. The front splitter included three removable protective wear-resistant rub strips, while the stainless steel tension cables provided enough support to absorb the energy from minor upward deflections. In terms of aerodynamics, the car made use of the high-performance autoclaved carbon-fiber to reduce weight. Lightweight filler panels replace the front fog lamps and gloss black lightweight forged aluminum Sidewinder wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup DOT-approved (street-legal) race tires finish off the exterior of the car. The Viper SRT-10 ACR features a signature two-tone paint scheme with a black center section. There is an optional driver's stripe available which features a sewn leather accent on the steering wheel. A monotone paint scheme is available as an option that features a body-color rear wing and dual painted stripes. Five colors were available especially for the ACR variant namely; Viper Red, Viper Black, Viper Violet, Viper Bright Blue Metallic, and Viper Very Orange. The interior is driver focused with the deletion of the audio system in favor of a lightweight cover on the dashboard that can be used to mount a lap-timer, deletion of the floor mats, underhood silencer pad and the tire inflator in the optional \\"Hard Core\\" package in order to save weight. The use of carbon fiber along with the minimalist interior make the car lighter than the standard SRT-10 coupe when equipped with the Hard Core package, and lighter without. Power remained the same as the SRT-10 but the maximum speed was reduced to for the 2008-2009 models and in 2010 models with the redesigned wing endplates. The SRT10 ACR features a suspension system that includes adjustable coil-over racing dampers from KW Suspensions and two-way adjustable shocks. The dampers and forks are made from solid aluminum billet and are optimized for increased weight reduction and performance. Stopping power comes from StopTech two-piece, slotted lightweight rotors combined with the Viper SRT10's Brembo calipers. This setup reduces rotating inertia and unsprung mass, improves brake cooling, and significantly reduces fade even under extreme conditions. Due to the improved brakes, the car stops from in less than . Braking from is shorter by than the standard car, steady-state lateral grip has improved by 0.11 g, and improved transient dynamics through the salom bump up the average speed by .  Viper SRT-10 ACR X  The Viper SRT-10 ACR X is a more powerful, track only, limited edition variant of the Viper ACR, produced at the end of the fourth generation Viper's production run. The ACR X is powered by the same V10 engine which powered all of the fourth generation cars but received a power increase to at 6,100 rpm and of torque at 5,100 rpm. The suspension is adjustable and higher spring rates allow the chassis to maximize grip from the special 18-inch-front and 19-inch rear Michelin racing slicks. Various aerodynamic enhancements, such as additional dive planes on the front fascia, provide up to 1,100 pounds of downforce at , or about 100 more than on the regular ACR. The X's curb weight is claimed to be reduced by compared with the standard ACR's weight. The new total‚Äîabout ‚Äîwas mostly realized by thoroughly stripping out the interior. The dash board and the center console are retained from the ACR and an eight- point, SCCA-certified roll cage and fuel cell were fitted, a single racing seat and harness, deletion of side windows, and a removable Momo steering wheel complete the interior. Other racing add-ons include a fire-suppression system, transmission and differential coolers, and larger front brake rotors fed by ducting that is more efficient than the street car's. The X's improved power-to-weight ratio improves acceleration by 1/10th of a second as compared to the ACR's 3.4-second 0-to- time and enables the car to complete the in 11.8-seconds at . The modifications made to the car help it achieve 1.08 g of skidpad grip, but courtesy to the extreme drag generated by all the downforce- generating aero components, the top speed is reduced to .  Production  On November 4, 2009, Dodge Brand President and CEO Ralph Gilles announced that the Viper would cease production in the summer of 2010. Keeping the end of production onto consideration, Dodge announced several special edition Vipers for the 2010 model year: Voodoo edition: The Voodoo edition (31 units were made) was a special take on the ACR edition which included special black paint and red striping. The Voodoo edition also had a unique interior and steering wheel as well. 1:33 Edition: The 1:33 edition was another take on the ACR edition which celebrates the then unofficial lap record at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. The 1:33 edition had black paint and red two-tone paint. The 1:33 cars have piano black trim inside and red accent stitching on the seats. Final Edition: On February 10, 2010, Dodge began accepting orders for the Viper SRT10 \\"Final Edition\\" models. Only 50 cars were produced (20 coupes, 18 roadsters and 12 ACRs). \\"Final Edition\\" cars carried the special build code, \\"AXZ\\", and were to be the very last of the Viper cars. July 1, 2010 brought about the end of production for the fourth generation of the Dodge Viper. During an event hosted by Dodge and the Viper Club of America, the final iteration of the Viper, which was given a gold finish with contrasting orange stripes, was presented in front of those attending the ceremony. Its completion commemorated the end of production of the ZB II Viper.

The inherited position of the kingdom's monarch became a legislatively elected office with Lunalilo. Upon Lunalilo's death, KalƒÅkaua won election over his political opponent Queen Emma. He reigned from February 12, 1874, until his death in San Francisco, California, on January 20, 1891. During his 1874‚Äì75 state visit to the United States, he made history as the first reigning monarch to visit the United States. His trip to Washington, D.C. established two diplomatic benchmarks. One was the United States Congress holding their first joint meeting in the body's history, less formal than a joint session, specifically for an audience with him. The second was President Ulysses S. Grant hosting him as honoree of the first state dinner at the White House.; KalƒÅkaua's 1881 world tour was his attempt to save the Hawaiian culture and population from extinction by importing a labor force from Asia-Pacific nations. His efforts brought the small island nation to the attention of world leaders, and also gave him the distinction of being the first reigning monarch to circumnavigate the globe.

One of the best known pastry shops in Belgrade, it used to supply the Serbian Royal Court with pastry while the Nobelist author Ivo Andriƒá wrote about it. The \\"Pelivan\\" was founded in 1851 and is the oldest still operational pastry shop in the city, working under the same name and owned by the same family since foundation. With the kafana Znak pitanja, it is among the oldest surviving foodservice venues in the city. The shop became a synonym for the Belgrade supreme pastry and, especially, ice cream, which is often described as the best in Belgrade - \\"why do you say Pelivan if you mean ice cream\\". It has been named as one of the rare remaining \\"historical threads\\" which connect modern city with the period of the Defenders of the Constitution (1842-1858) and a \\"tradition which survived two royal dynasties, Communism and several states\\".  Location  The shop is located at 20 Bulevar kralja Aleksandra. It is situated near the crossroads of the Bulevar, Takovska and Kneza Milo≈°a streets, right across the building of the General Post Office and the Constitutional Court of Serbia. The shop itself is bounded by the new, vacated building on the right, and the embassy of the Czech Republic on the left. The empty building was a location of once famed Belgrade kafana \\"Three tobacco leaves\\". Opened in the 1880s, it was also noted for the first telephone exchange in Belgrade, which was installed in the venue. Across the street, in the northeast direction are the St. Mark's Church and the Ta≈°majdan Park. The Pioneers Park and the House of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia are also in the vicinity.  History   Origin  The glass Staklenac shopping mall in the central right section of the photo is the location of the original Pelivan shop Mustafa Pelivan, who founded the shop, was a Gorani, who originated from the village of Zli Potok, near the small town of Draga≈° in the region of Gora, south of Prizren. He arrived in Belgrade as a wrestler, or pelivan, as they were called at the time, which he took as his family name. Pelivan acquired the initial capital winning at the wrestling competitions. He was declared the \\"best wrestler in Serbia\\" and won a significant prize after defeating \\"some Turk\\", which he invested in the pastry shop. At the time, wrestling meant that the participants would \\"put on the leather (under)pants, oil themselves and wrestle\\". Gorani people, Islamized Slavic population, in general are known as excellent pastry and sweets chefs. When opened on 24 May 1851, his shop was one of only few in Belgrade. Pelivan used to mix ice cream in the bucket filled with ice.  Old shop 1851-1941  The original shop was located close to the Stambol Gate. At the time the neighborhood was known as Zerek, or upper section of the Dorƒáol neighborhood. It was situated where the modern Staklenac shopping center is today, on the \\"Plateau of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá\\" section of the Republic Square in downtown Belgrade. In 1868, 17 years later, a monumental building of the National Theatre in Belgrade was built almost across the shop. The business was growing and two more shops were opened. Pelivan was succeeded by his son, Mehmed Pelivanoviƒá and then by his grandson Maliƒá Pelivanoviƒá. The venue became quite distinguished in time. The shop supplied the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá Royal Court with halva and was awarded a Royal certificate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1936. The family itself gained prominence and Maliƒá Pelivanoviƒá was elected a deputy to the Parliament of Yugoslavia after World War I.  Present shop from 1941  After Maliƒá, his cousin Azir Pelivanoviƒá (d.24 May 1994) took over. He served ice cream in Belgrade in scoops for the first time. The old shop was destroyed during the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. Azir immediately decided to start from scratch and on 22 August 1941 he opened a new one, on the present location. The production was fully restored by the end of 1941. After the war ended, Azir managed to acquire the newest ice cream machines from Italy and concocted the famous recipe. He was fearful that the new Communist authorities might take the shop from him in the massive wave of nationalization which they conducted. They stripped him of the ownership of the land in the Slavija neighborhood and detained him for a while. The lot on Slavija had a house which Azir planned to use for another shop. Further expansion of the business was halted by the authorities but in time members of the new Communist elite, not only local from Belgrade but also from Croatia and Slovenia, became regular customers. Azir also dedicated himself to education of generations of pastry chefs which started their own businesses all over Serbia and Yugoslavia. Popular story says that after he caught his nephews paying the lottery tickets with the money from the till, he forced them to saw their pockets. New golden age of the \\"Pelivan\\" was from the 1950s to the early 1980s. By 1980, the shop was selling of ice cream and of boza daily. The kafana \\"Three tobacco leaves\\", next to the \\"Pelivan\\", was demolished in the late 1980s in order to make way for the new Hotel Hilton, but due to the ensuing wars, the project was scrapped. For a while there was a mounted parking until the new, modern building was built in the 2000s, which remained empty. Due to the economic collapse of the state, the shop was in dire financial situation in the late 1980s and the 1990s. As criminal bloomed, just like with numerous other venues, the shop became pray of the racketeers. Azir's daughter Seija and her husband Ahmad al ≈†ukeir, who moved from Syria to Belgrade in 1980 to study medicine, headed the shop in this period. With the political changes in the 2000s, the period of botched transition began, which deprived many people of jobs and incomes, so the business remained unpredictable, but gradually began to improve. In the 2010s, the youngest generation took over the business, Suhaib al ≈†ukeir (b.1982) and his brothers Bara and Musab, sons of Seija, who died, and Ahmad, who returned to Damascus.  Venue  The ice cream from \\"Pelivan\\" is often named as the best in Belgrade. The shop is known for giving ice cream for free on certain dates, marking anniversaries of the shop or commemorating dates from the lives of previous owners. Author Ivo Andriƒá wrote about the pastry shop in his work \\"Signs by the roadside\\". He described it as the \\"obligatory stop\\" in Belgrade. It became a favorite pastry shop of numerous actors, politicians (as the National Assembly is close), writers and tourists, including Danilo Bata Stojkoviƒá, Nikola Simiƒá and Predrag Ejdus. Stojkoviƒá was visiting almost every day and was known for bringing order into the row, which at the time stretched into the Kneza Milo≈°a Street. The shop, with its old commercial tagline, is mentioned in the elementary school textbook \\"Old crafts\\". The recipe for the famous Pelivan ice cream devised by Azir Pelivanoviƒá is still a secret. It has been passed from one generation to another, only the owners at the time are familiar with it and they personally prepare the compound from which the ice cream is made. Until the 1990s, only relatives were employed in the shop. It was only revealed that in the early 21st century the ice cream making generally shifted to the new technologies (Italian style) and ingredients, which makes the ice cream look and taste more like a paste, but \\"Pelivan\\" kept the original milk-and-eggs based recipe.

They refused to pay the fine, and instead founded the rival Hyde Seal Swimming Club, with Fowden as secretary. The club proved successful, and by 1904 Fowden was competing for it in Paris. The event was regarded as an unofficial world championship, and the Seals won the 500m competition. Fowden became a hotel owner, and also joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP).

He is the leader of a gang which went on to be called the \\"Moneychangers Gang\\", or (more precisely) \\"Gang of moneychangers killers\\".  Early life  Grzesik was born in Wola Jachowa, where his parents ran a farm. He had four siblings. He studied at a vocational school to become a fitter, but did not graduate. According to his own account, he then became a carpenter who worked in the Wujek and Makoszowy coal mines, before beginning work in the Construction Combination in Katowice. Grzesik is married, and has two children.  Murders   Triple murder in Cedzyna The most likely first murders Grzesik took part in were on September 19, 1991 in Cedzyna, when he participated in the shooting of three Ukrainian citizens in a parking lot - two men and a woman. He raped the woman before killing her. Biologicals traces belonging to two men were secured from her body, but the case was discontinued in 1993. In 2001, the investigation was resumed and suspicions fell on Janusz Trela's gang, but the trail proved false, and the case remained unsolved for 18 years. The breakthrough came when Grzesik was arrested in 2007 and he took a DNA test, making it possible to connect him to the murders in Cedzyna. The second secured DNA was traced to Stanis≈Çaw T. However, he did not outlive the trial, as he had committed suicide during his imprisonment in the main prison of Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. In addition to the traces, evidence in the case was also the testimony of gunsmith Jacek P., who admitted that in 1991 he had crafted a Beretta for Grzesik, the same weapon with which the murders were carried out. Grzesik was legally sentenced to 25 years imprisonment in 2013 in connection with the three murders and rape.  Suspected murder in Machowa  The prosecutor's office is investigating Grzesik's possible involvement in the murder of a currency dealer in 1992.  Wola Jachowa disappearance  Grzesik is also suspected of murdering a resident of his hometown in August 1997, who was possible killed because of debt-related issues. The victim's body was never found.  Double murder in Cedzyna  Another case in which Grzesik is suspected is the murder of two men from Radlin, ≈Åukasz S. and Mariusz J., both of whom were shot in front of a bar on July 3, 1998.  Skorzeszyce murder  Tadeusz Grzesik is also suspected of another crime - the murder of 17-year-old Roman K. on the night between July 18 and 19, 1998. The teen was returning from a discotheque when he was brutally murdered, with two of his friends being brutally beaten up and left requiring hospitalization. His body was found in the morning of July 19.  Niestach√≥w murder  Grzesik is also suspected of murdering Res-Bud driver Andrzej K., who was shot on April 30, 1999.  Krajno-Parcelach murder  On June 20, 1999, Krystyna M. was murdered. She, just like Andrzej K., was a worker at Res-Bud who was shot. Grzesik is suspected of being involved in her murder.  'Bureaucrats Gang' murders  Grzesik, together with Wojciech W. and Jacek P., created a gang that between 2005 and 2007 attacked owners of currency exchange offices. They were convicted in 2015. The offenses for which they were convicted are the following: * murder in Kra≈õnik (December 2005) * attempted murder in Sosnowiec (January 2006) * murder in Tarn√≥w (January 2007) * murder and attempted murder in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski (January 2007) * double murder in My≈õlenice (February 2007) However, according to the prosecutor's office, these killings do not constitute all the crimes committed by the gang. In 2016, Tadeusz Grzesik and Wojciech W. were accused of a double murder in Ostr√≥w. On November 16, 2006, they allegedly attacked Antoni B., the owner of a currency exchange office who was killed with a submachine gun. They also had shot at two employees of the exchange office, one of them dying as a result of his wounds, while the other suffered long-term damage to his health. Further allegations made by the prosecutor's office concerns murders in Przeworsk. The perpetrators were to kill the owner of an exchange office, Zygmunt G. and his partner, Maria P. On January 12, 2007, Grzesik, along with accomplice Adam M., according to the prosecutor's office, attacked an exchange office in Dƒôbica and attempted to kill the owner, but failed to do so as a result of their weapons jamming. According to Gazeta Wyborcza, the group had also committed various crimes in Daleszyce, Kolbuszowa, Domaszowice, Cedzyna, Sanok, Makoszyn, MiƒÖsowa and other towns.  In the media  Tadeusz Grzesik and his accomplices were killed in the 13th episode in the third season of the hit Polish TV series Pitbull; some details of the crimes committed were changed for the scenario.

He is regarded by many contemporaries and modern scholars as a key reason for Sparta's early failures in the Ionian War. His expeditions consisting of involvements in Lesbos, Chios, Erythrae and Clazomenae all proved unsuccessful. He also refused requests for help from Chios, causing the Spartan administration to become increasingly dissatisfied with his leadership. Thucydides portrays Astyochus as timid and inept, and also depicts him often in conflict with his peers in Ionia. Toward the end of his role of commander, he exhibited great reluctance to attack the Athenians and also failed to properly pay his troops, leading to riots and violence, and eventually, his removal as commander in 412 BC, to be replaced by the Spartan Mindarus.  Involvement in the Peloponnesian War  In 412 BC, Astyochus replaced Melancridas as the leader of the naval forces, and was assigned to assist the cities on the mainland of Asia Minor, as well as the surrounding islands along the coast. His immediate task was to advance the Spartan agenda by weakening the allegiances of these areas to Athens, as well as to demonstrate the continued support of Spartan control and assistance through his presence. At this time, the Athenians had already lost their position in Sicily for a year, and had also just lost their foothold in Chios due to revolt. Astyochus arrived off Chios with four galleys. However, Lesbos had recently transformed into a war zone, as the Chians had incited revolts in the key cities of Methymna and Mytilene. The Athenians stormed Mytilene in response, and Astyochus, upon his arrival, found that he could offer no help. The resulting Athenian recapture of Lesbos occurred as Astyochus withdrew to Chios. Athens' next move was to launch an attack on Chios in an attempt to restore its sovereignty. The attack was so successful that some Chians began plotting and conspiring to restore Athenian leadership in Chios. Astyochus was then accordingly summoned by the government when they learned of news of the revolt and was therefore tasked with neutralising the threat posed by the conspirators. The revolt was somewhat suppressed due to some of the conspirators being taken hostage by Astyochus and his Chian supporters. During this time, Theramenes, a Lacedaemonian, delivered to Astyochus a large fleet of 55 Peloponnesian and Sicilian ships. This reinforcement to the Spartan forces removed Astyochus' worry about the Chian revolt, so he instead turned his attention to Clazomenae, where he made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the area. Following his failed attempt at Clazomenae, Astyochus' assistance in a second uprising against Athens was requested by Spartan representatives at Lesbos. While Astyochus was eager to provide help, he was nevertheless forced to return to Chios after the plans for insurrection were opposed by the Corinthians and other Spartan allies. Now back at Chios, Astyochus listened to new proposals for a revolt from the people of Lesbos. While Astyochus supported these new plans, he was once again forced into inaction as the plans were opposed by the Chians and Pedaritus, the commander of the Spartan land force. The opposition that he was receiving greatly angered Astyochus, and he vowed to never come to the assistance of the Chians again. He then sailed to take command of the Peloponnesian and Sicilian fleet, recently delivered by Theramenes. On his journey, he narrowly escaped capture by the Athenians and eventually assembled his forces at Miletus. In Miletus, a recently signed treaty between the Kings of Persia and Sparta was revised with Astyochus' assistance. The revised treaty contained updated terms that were skewed toward Spartan interest. Meanwhile, Chios came under attack by Athenians, prompting them to request Miletus for aid. However, per his last vow, Astyochus denied this request for assistance, causing Pedaritus to report his conduct to Sparta. The worsening plight of the Chian position meant that Pedaritus continued to urge Astyochus for his aid, while Chios could still be saved. However, when Astyochus was finally preparing to aid the Chians, he suddenly gave up the expedition, and proceeded southwards to escort a fleet with 11 Spartan commissioners to Miletus. This fleet of 27 galleys and 11 commissioners originated from Peloponnesus, and were tasked to decide to either aid or depose of Astyochus. On the journey to Miletus, Astyochus attacked and sacked the island of Cos. He then sailed to Cnidus, after defeating the Athenian admiral, Charminus, with minimal casualties. At Cnidus, the Spartan commissioners questioned Tissaphernes, a Persian satrap under the Spartan-Persian alliance, angering him so greatly in the process that he left them soon after. It was around this time, at Miletus, that Astyochus appeared to sell himself to Tissaphernes, and also did not play a pivotal role in the successful revolt of the Rhodians from Athens by the united Peloponnesian fleet. The increasing suspicion of the Spartans on Alcibiades and his interest among the Asiatic Greeks meant that Astyochus eventually received orders to kill Alcibiades. However, Astyochus betrayed this agenda. When he received a letter from Phrynichus, the Athenian commander, informing him that Alcibiades was exerting influence over Tissaphernes to the detriment of Sparta, Astyochus instead travelled to Magnesia to deliver this letter to Alcibiades and Tissaphernes at their residence. Furthermore, when Astyochus received a second letter from Phrynichus offering to betray the Athenian stronghold at Samos, he did the same. Thucydides offers further evidence of Astyochus' defection to Tissaphernes: his submission to the pay cut of Peloponnesian sailors, and his lack of action in capitalising on the weakened and disorganised Athenian forces in Samos and the Hellespont during 411 BC. In addition, Astyochus not only failed to pay the troops, but also refused to attack the Athenians at Samos under the guise of waiting for further reinforcement in the form of a Phoenician armament that Tissaphernes had promised. However, Astyochus eventually did set sail with 112 galleys to attack the Athenians at Samos, as he had faced strong pressure and complaints from the Syracusan sailors and the Peloponnesian soldiers at Miletus. Nevertheless, the fighting never ensued, and it is almost certain that Astyochus did not desire engagement. Meanwhile, the troops' wages, both that of common soldiers and higher-ranked officers, continued to be neglected by Tissaphernes. Soon, Astyochus was charged with having sold the troops' interests to Tissaphernes, and Astyochus' threats towards some of the Syracusans demanding their wages only served to incite a riot, in which he was almost killed. It was at this point in time which Astyochus set sail for home, and was relieved of his duties after 8 months in command, and was succeeded by Mindarus, arriving from Sparta.

Gnathaena was an Athenian hetaira (plural: hetairai), a class of ancient Greek prostitutes who were companions to wealthy men. Though there is no source for either her date of birth or date of death, Gnathaena is known to have lived during the 4th century BCE due to her affiliations with various men of the era. Her most notable lover was Diphilus, an Athenian New Comedy playwright. According to Athenaeus, Gnathaena was famous for her lavish parties and witty repartee, and even wrote a treatise on proper conduct at her symposiums entitled, \\"Rules for Dining in Company\\".  Life as a hetaira  Gnathaena was one of many fourth-century women in the class of prostitutes known as a hetaira, or \\"companion\\". The hetairai were a class of courtesans in ancient Greece that were distinct from pornai, another type of prostitute, as hetairai were thought to be women who consorted exclusively in aristocratic circles and with only a few men as opposed to selling sexual acts through a brothel as pornai did. Hetairai were not paid according to what sexual acts they performed with their patrons; instead, they were paid for their companionship over a long period of time. They also provided intellectual stimulation in addition to sexual pleasure and were thought to be well-educated in some circumstances.Hamel, Debra (2003). Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece. New Haven & London: Yale. p. 12. However, this definition of what hetairai did is contested by the Oxford Classical Dictionary (second edition) as well as by the lawyer Apollodorus in his prosecution speech \\"Against Neaera\\". Both of these sources maintain that hetairai were grouped in with pornai as general prostitutes.Hammond, N.G.L.; Scullard, H.H., eds. (1970). The Oxford Classical Dictionary (2 ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 512.Kapparis, Konstantinos A. (1999). Apollodoros 'Against Neaira' [D.59]. pp. 422‚Äì423. Gnathaena and other hetairai were traditionally a part of the symposium, a banquet of aristocratic men that involved drinking, dancing, and music as well as consorting with hetairai. The symposium was an integral part of the social life of respected men. Being a part of the hetairai class afforded Gnathaena the luxury of becoming highly educated, controlling her own finances, and additionally hosting banquets and symposiums of her own that were attended by the wealthy men with whom she consorted. These opportunities were not a substantial part of the ancient Athenian woman's life or social expectations at the time. Women of Athens traditionally had a limited ability to hold land or participate in their own financial decisions, and were not particularly involved socially in the way that men were, past some religious festivals such as the Thesmophoria. Gnathaena both attended and hosted symposiums, using her popularity to invite upper-class men to dine and to match wits with her. She eventually wrote a code of conduct for proper manners at these symposiums called \\"Rules for Dining in Company\\" that describes the rules for dining at her table. Some scholars believe that this is a testament to how well-respected she was in her time and an indication of the higher status afforded to hetaira, as Gnathaena made the rules for her own household and was not beholden to a man in the way that most Athenian women were. Gnathaena's treatise was a collection of rules stating which men were allowed to enter into her and her daughters' house to be a part of the symposiums they hosted, as well as how the men should conduct themselves once they were participating. Athenaeus describes Gnathaena's treatise as follows: > Gnathaena... even compiled a code of laws for banquets, according to which > lovers were to be admitted to her and to her daughters, in imitation of the > philosophers, who had drawn up similar documents. And Callimachus has > recorded this code of hers in the third Catalogue of Laws which he has > given; and he has quoted the first words of it as follows:- \\"This law has > been compiled, being fair and equitable; and it is written in three hundred > and twenty-three verses.\\" Gnathaena is described extensively by Athenaeus as being \\"very witty and prompt in repartee\\" and having multiple lovers (some named, some unnamed) to whom she provided both intellectual and emotional companionship as well as sexual relations. Being a hetaira, Gnathaena often verbally sparred or competed intellectually with her lovers using wordplay or insults. Athenaeus gives examples of a few of what he considers to be her wittiest phrases in his work Deipnosophistae: > Once, when a man came to see her, and saw some eggs on a dish, and said, > \\"Are these raw, Gnathaena, or boiled?\\" \\"They are made of brass, my boy,\\" > said she. On one occasion, when Chaerephon came to sup with her without an > invitation, Gnathaena pledged him in a cup of wine. \\"Take it,\\" said she, > \\"you proud fellow.\\" And he said, \\"I proud?\\" \\"Who can be more so,\\" said she, > \\"when you come without even being invited?\\" [...] On one occasion, some men > were drinking in her house, and were eating some lentils dressed with onions > (Œ≤ŒøŒªŒ≤ŒøœÜŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑); as the maidservant was clearing the table, and putting some of > the lentils in her bosom (Œ∫œåŒªœÄŒøŒΩ), Gnathaena said, \\"She is thinking of > making some bosom-lentils (Œ∫ŒøŒªœÄŒøœÜŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑).\\"  Lovers and family  One of the most notable of Gnathaena's consorts was Diphilus, an Athenian comedic playwright who wrote around 100 plays in the style of New Comedy. Athenaeus cites Machon as his evidence for Diphilus' and Gnathaena's relationship and extensively chronicles his own musings on the subject. According to Athenaeus, Gnathaena often made fun of Diphilus and his plays, though he is described as \\"a man above her other lovers beloved by her\\". Though Diphilus was possibly her favorite lover, Athenaeus also mentions unnamed others and alludes to many more. During the course of her life, Gnathaena had multiple daughters (unnamed) who helped their mother host parties and entertain guests. One of Gnathaena's daughters also had a daughter named Gnathaeni≈èn.
