Other threats include grazing by livestock and wildlife, and the invasion of introduced species of plants, two types of disturbance the plant does not tolerate. Other threats include the lack of a normal fire regime, insect damage, drought, and climate change. Gravel mining, herbicides, and off-road vehicles are threats in some areas.

In these areas, cantons were formed, whose federation would constitute the base of the Spanish Federal Republic. The political theory on which the cantonal movement was based was the \\"pactist\\" federalism of Francisco Pi y Margall against whose government the \\"intransigent\\" federal republicans (paradoxically) rose up against. When the policy of the Pi y Margall government failed to combine persuasion with repression to end the insurrection, the government that replaced him chaired by the \\"moderate\\" Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n did not hesitate to employ the army led by generals Arsenio Mart√≠nez Campos and Manuel Pavia to crush the rebellion, a policy that accentuated the next government of the also \\"moderate\\" Emilio Castelar, who, after suspending the sessions of the Cortes, began the siege of Cartagena, the last stronghold of the rebellion. Cartagena would not fall into the hands government until January 12, a week after the coup of Pavia that ended the federal Republic giving way to the dictatorship of Serrano. Although the cantonal rebellion was considered a \\"separatist\\" movement by the Government of the Republic, the current historiography highlights that the rebellion only sought to reform the structure of the state, without ever wanting to break the unity of Spain. Background The proclamation of the Republic On February 11, 1873, the day after the abdication of Amadeo I, the National Assembly proclaimed Spain to be a Republic by 258 votes against 32, but without defining it as unitary or federal, postponing the decision to future Constituent Courts. Portrait of Estanislao Figueras, first president of the executive government of the first republic. That same day, the self-proclaimed National Assembly appointed the Federal Republican Estanislao Figueras as president of the republic. His government needed to reestablish the order that was being altered by the federal republicans themselves, who had understood the proclamation of the Republic as a new revolution. Federal republicans seized power by force in many places, where they formed \\"revolutionary juntas\\" that did not recognize the government of Figueras, because it was a coalition government with the former monarchists of the Radical Party, and branded the \\"Republicans of Madrid\\" as lukewarm. In many villages of Andalusia, the Republic was something so identified with the distribution of land that the peasants demanded the municipalities immediately parcel out the most significant farms in the town ... some of which previously formed part of communal property before confiscation. In almost all places the Republic also identified itself with the abolition of the hated fifth (compulsory military service for young people). Responsible for the task of restoring order was the Minister of the Interior Francisco Pi y Margall, paradoxically the main defender of \\"pactist\\" federalism from the bottom-up, which the juntas were putting into practice. Pi achieved the dissolution of the juntas and the replacement of the municipalities that were forcibly suspended, in \\"a clear proof of his commitment to respect legality even against the wishes of his own supporters\\", although he maintained the armed republican and old monarchical militias. Cartoon from the satirical magazine La Flaca (March 3, 1873) about the struggle between the radicals, who defend the unitary republic, and the federal republicans who defend the federal. And also about the struggle between the \\"transigent\\" and \\"intransigent\\" federal republicans Pi y Margall also needed to deal twice with the proclamation of a ‚ÄúCatalan State‚Äù by the Provincial Deputation of Barcelona, dominated by ‚Äúintransigent‚Äù federal Republicans. First on February 12, the day after the proclamation of the Republic in Madrid, Pi y Margall managed to convince them to give up by telegrams sent to them from Madrid. The second took place on March 8, when an attempted coup d'√©tat took place in Madrid, the radicals were trying to prevent the republic from proclaiming itself federal by preventing the convening of the Constituent Courts. This time, the telegrams of Pi y Margall were not enough. It was necessary that four days later, on March 12, Estanislao Figueras himself went to Barcelona and asked the provincial government to withdraw the independence declaration. A third attempted coup d'√©tat by the Radical Party, attempting to paralyze the convocation of the Constituent Courts, took place on April 23. The \\"intransigent\\" Republicans and the press put pressure on the government to proclaim the Federal Republic without waiting for the Constituent Courts to convene, but the government adhered to the law. Pi y Margall received hundreds of telegrams that said:  The proclamation of the Federal Republic  In May, the elections for the Constituent Courts were held. Because of the withdrawal of the rest of the parties, an overwhelming victory was achieved by the Federal Democratic Republican Party. But this situation was misleading because in reality the federal Republican deputies of the Cortes were divided into three groups: * The \\"intransigents\\" with about 60 deputies formed the left of the House and advocated that the Courts build the Federal Republic from the bottom up, from the municipality to the cantons and from these to the federal level. They also defended the introduction of social reforms that would improve the living conditions of the proletariat. This sector of the federal Republicans did not have a clear leader, although they recognized Jos√© Mar√≠a Orense as their \\"patriarch.\\" Alongside him were Nicol√°s Est√©vanez, Francisco D√≠az Quintero, the generals Juan Contreras and Blas Pierrad, and the writers Roque Barcia and Manuel Fern√°ndez Herrero. The model they favored was that of Switzerland. * The \\"centrists\\" led by Pi y Margall agreed with the \\"intransigents\\" that the objective was to build a federal republic, but they wanted to do so from the top-down, first drafting a federal Constitution and then proceeding to the formation of cantons. The number of deputies that this sector had was not very large and on many occasions they acted divided in the votes, although they mostly favored the proposals of the \\"intransigents\\". They favored the model used by the United States. * The \\"moderates\\" constituted the right of the Chamber and were led by Emilio Castelar and Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n and defended the formation of a democratic Republic that would accommodate all liberal options. They rejected the \\"intransigent\\" proposal to convert the Cortes into a revolutionary power and agreed with the \\"centrists\\" that the priority of the Cortes was to approve a new Constitution. They constituted the largest group of the Chamber, although there were certain differences between the followers of Castelar, who were in favor of the conciliation with the radicals and constitutionalists, and the followers of Salmer√≥n, who advocated that the Republic should only be based on the alliance of \\"old\\" republicans. Their favored model was that of France. Despite this division, they had no problem proclaiming the Federal Democratic Republic on June 8, a week after the Constituent Courts were opened under the presidency of the veteran ‚Äúintransigent‚Äù Republican Jos√© Mar√≠a Orense, by 218 votes against two.  The opposition of the \\"intransigents\\" to the federal governments of Figueras and Pi y Margall  As soon as the Constituent Courts next met, Estanislao Figueras returned his powers to the Chamber and proposed that Pi y Margall be appointed to replace him, but the intransigents were opposed to this and got Pi to give up on his attempt at taking power. Figueras then learned that the \\"intransigent\\" generals Juan Contreras and Blas Pierrad were preparing a coup d'√©tat to start the federal Republic \\"from below\\", outside the Government and the Cortes, which made Figueras fear for his life. On June 10, Figueras, who was already suffering a severe depression from the death of his wife, fled to France. The attempted coup d'√©tat came the next day when a mass of federal Republicans, instigated by the \\"intransigents\\", surrounded the building of the Congress of Deputies in Madrid while General Contreras, commanding the militia of the Volunteers of the Republic, took the Ministry of War. The \\"moderates\\" Emilio Castelar and Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n proposed that Pi and Margall occupy the vacant presidency of the Executive Power as he was the most prestigious leader within the Republican party. \\"Castelar and Salmer√≥n believed that Pi y Margall, close to the intransigents, who had given them their ideological base and organization, could control and satisfy the parliamentary left through a conciliation cabinet.\\" Finally, the \\"intransigents\\" accepted the proposal, although under the condition that it was the Courts that elected the members of the government to preside over Pi y Margall. Portrait of Francisco Pi y Margall, second president of the Executive Power of the Republic. The government program presented by Pi y Margall to the Cortes was based on the need to end the Third Carlist War, separate Church and State, abolish slavery and pass reforms in favor of working women and children. It also included the return of communal property to the people through a law that modified confiscation, but the law was not approved. Another, the purpose of which was to transfer land to tenants in exchange for the payment of a census, was also rejected by the Cortes. The one that was passed was a law that dictated rules \\"to redeem rents and pensions.\\" Finally, the program included, as a priority, the drafting and approval of the new Constitution of the Federal Republic. Immediately, the government of Pi y Margall met with the opposition of the \\"intransigents\\", because they did not include some of the historical policies of the federalists in their program, such as \\"the abolition of tobacco, the lottery, court costs and the consumption tax, which was replaced in 1870 due to lack of resources\\". The ineffectiveness of the government, because of the blockade work carried out by the \\"intransigent\\" ministers, led to a proposal to grant the President of the Executive Power the power to appoint and dismiss their ministers freely. Its approval would allow Pi to replace the intransigent ministers with others from the \\"moderate\\" sector, thus creating a coalition government between the Pimargalian \\"centrists\\" and the \\"moderates\\" of Castelar and Salmer√≥n. The response of the \\"intransigents\\" was to demand that the Courts be converted into a Convention, from which a Public Health Board would emanate that would hold executive power, a proposal that was rejected by the majority of deputies who supported the government. Then on June 27, the \\"intransigents\\" filed a vote of censure against the government, which included the paradoxical request that its president Pi y Margall be passed to their ranks. The crisis was resolved the next day, as the \\"intransigents\\" feared, with the entry of the \\"moderates\\" into the government and the strengthening the Pimargalians' presence. The program of the new government was summed up in the motto \\"order and progress\\". On June 30, Pi y Margall asked the Cortes for extraordinary powers to end the Carlist war, although limited to the Basque Country and Catalonia. The \\"intransigents\\" viciously opposed the proposal because they understood it as the imposition of \\"tyranny\\" and the \\"loss of democracy,\\" although the government assured them that it would only apply to the Carlists and not to the federal Republicans. Once the proposal was approved by the Cortes, the government published a manifesto in which, after justifying the extraordinary powers it had received, it announced conscription to the Army of the fifths and the reserves, because ¬´the country demands the sacrifice of all its children, and he who does not do so to the best of his strength, will not be liberal or Spanish¬ª.  The beginning of the cantonal rebellion and the resignation of Pi and Margall  The \\"Intransigents\\" abandon the Cortes The \\"intransigent\\" response to the \\"order and progress\\" policy of the Pi y Margall government was to leave the Cortes on July 1, motivated by Madrid's civil governor limiting the guarantees of individual rights. In the Manifesto they made public on July 2 they showed their determination \\"to immediately raise the reforms that the Republican Party had been sustaining in its tireless propaganda\\" justified because in their judgment: Only the deputy Navarrete remained in the Cortes who, on that same day, explained the reasons for their withdrawal, accusing the Pi y Margall government of lacking energy and of having compromised and even faltered against the enemies of the Federal Republic. Pi y Margall replied in that same session: After the abandonment of the Cortes, the \\"intransigents\\" urged the immediate and direct formation of cantons, initiating the cantonal rebellion. They formed a Public Health Committee in Madrid to lead it, although ¬´ what prevailed was the initiative of the local federal republicans, who became owners of the situation in their respective cities ¬ª. Although there were cases like the one in M√°laga where local authorities led the uprising, most of them formed revolutionary juntas. Two weeks after the withdrawal of the Cortes, the revolt was a fact in Murcia, Valencia and Andalusia. Although there was no organizational center of the rebellion and each canton made its own proclamations, the rebels \\"beyond the logical local particularities\\" pursued the same purposes: \\"the substitution of all types of governmental or jurisdictional authorities, the abolition of taxes (especially the unpopular taxes on consumption, tobacco and salt), the secularization of church property, social reforms favorable to the great mass of the dispossessed that had no other good than their labor force, a pardon for all political crimes, the dissolution of the regular army and its replacement by militia troops, and the creation of public health boards and committees as governing bodies of a popular nature¬ª. On July 18, once the rebellion began in Cartagena and other cities, the Madrid Public Health Committee ordered: On August 22, when only the cantons of M√°laga and Cartagena were up and running, the ‚Äúintransigent‚Äù deputy Casualdero intervened in the Cortes to explain that the uprising was not illegal and seditious but had been the result of the putting into practice of the true federal ideal, from the bottom-up. That it is the canton that legitimizes the federation and not the other way around:  The proclamation of the Cartagena Canton  Header of the newspaper El Cant√≥n Murciano , published in Cartagena in 1873. After the abandonment of the Courts, the Public Health Committee that was established in Madrid under the presidency of Roque Barcia, thought about moving to Cartagena, ¬´because no other city possessed the characteristics of its port, well sheltered and defended by a series of strong and artillery castles that made Cartagena invulnerable both by sea and by land.¬ª The Public Health Committee constituted the War Commission, chaired by General Juan Contreras who undertook to revolt Cartagena, Valencia, Barcelona, Seville and Murcia. The insurrection began in Cartagena at five in the morning on July 12, following the instructions of a \\"Revolutionary Public Salvation Junta\\" that had been set up an hour earlier on the initiative of a liaison with the committee from Madrid, Manuel C√°rceles Sabater. The signal for the uprising was given by the Galeras Castle which fired a cannon, warning that the African regiment, which was going to relieve the garrison of volunteers, had retired. According to other versions of events, the cannon shot was the previously agreed signal to indicate to the frigate Almansa that the defenses had been taken. Flag of Ottoman Empire, hoisted over Galeras Castle and then dyed red the crescent and star to form the cantonal red flag The chief of the fort's garrison, the postman Saez, \\"in his eagerness to fly a red flag despite not having one, hoisted the Turkish flag believing that the crescent would not be seen, but the Navy commander saw it, communicating it to the Minister of the Navy [the telegram read: The castle of Galeras has raised the Turkish flag ]. A volunteer, watching over the prestige of the cause, opened a vein with the tip of his razor and stained the crescent with his blood, replacing the flag of Turkey with the red cantonal flag\\". At that same time, 5 a.m. on July 12, a group of volunteers in charge of C√°rceles invaded the town hall, installing the \\"Revolutionary Public Salvation Junta\\" on the ground floor while other groups occupied the gates of the city wall. Notified by the mayor of the city, the next day the civil governor of Murcia Antonio Altadill arrived in Cartagena, accompanied by the Murcian federal deputy Antonio G√°lvez Arce, known as Antonete. After assessing that the insurgents controlled the city, the governor advised the City Council to resign, which they did ‚Äúin the presence of the governor of the province‚Äù. Shortly after, the Junta raised the red flag over City Hall and proclaimed the Murcian Canton, then appointing Antonete G√°lvez general commander of the Army, Militia and Navy forces. In the Manifesto that was made public that same afternoon, the \\"Public Salvation Junta\\", constituted \\"by the will of the majority of the republican people of this town\\" justified the proclamation of the Murcian Canton as an act of defense of the Federal Republic. Then commanded by Antonete G√°lvez and General Juan Contreras, president of the War Committee that had moved from Madrid, the cantonal army seized the naval base's warships without causing casualties. Antonio G√°lvez Arce, Antonete The civil governor telegraphed the president of the Executive Power Francisco Pi y Margall that neither the Volunteers of the Republic nor the Civil Guard obeyed his orders to abandon Murcia. When he went to Madrid he was stopped by insurgents at the Alguazas station, 20 kilometers from the capital. Thus, on the morning of July 15, the ¬´Revolutionary Junta¬ª of Murcia was established, chaired by the deputy Jer√≥nimo Poveda, who raised the red flag in the City Hall and then in the archbishop's palace that became the seat of the Junta. In the Manifesto he made public, the \\"Revolutionary Junta\\" of Murcia presented the first measures he had taken (\\"pardon for all political prisoners\\", \\"the seizure of church assets\\", \\"the redistribution of property\\" etc.) and explained the reasons for its constitution: In the manifesto, the revolutionary Junta of Murcia established that the ¬´Revolutionary Juntas of the People will organize in them the municipal administration according to the federal system¬ª and also announced that they were going to appoint a commission that ¬´attends the armament and defenses of the Murcian Canton¬ª and another that ¬´establishes relations with the neighboring provinces¬ª. Both would be \\"under the orders of General Contreras and citizen Antonio G√°lvez\\", implicitly establishing the subordination of the Junta of Murcia to that of Cartagena in the direction of the Murciano Canton, which was thus established. On July 15, General Juan Contreras made public a Manifesto in which he communicated that he had just risen in arms to the shout of Federal cantons! And showed off the forces that supported him, especially the Navy, and asked the chiefs and officers of the \\"centralist\\" forces - he called those who remain faithful to the government of Pi y Margall and the legislature - not to fire \\"neither against the people nor against their brothers in arms.\\" He also promised that:  The response of Pi y Margall's government  Charicature in satirical newspaper La Flaca in which Pi y Margall is depicted overflowed by federalist children's figures dressed in the different regional costumes. Pi y Margall acknowledged that what the \\"Intransigents\\" were doing was putting his own \\"pactist\\" federalism theory into practice from the bottom up, but he condemned the insurrection anyway. He claimed that theory was intended for an occupation of power \\"through armed revolution\\" not for a ‚ÄúRepublic [that] has come by the agreement of an Assembly, in a legal and peaceful manner‚Äù. The Pi y Margall government was overwhelmed by the cantonal rebellion and also by the continuation of the Third Carlist War, since the supporters of Don Carlos campaigned with total freedom in Vascongadas, Navarra and Catalonia, and extended their action throughout the country, while the suitor Carlos VII had formed a rival government in Estella, while the collusion of France allowed them to receive external help. Another focus of conflict for the Pi y Margall government was the Petroleum Revolution that had started in Alcoy on 7 July with a strike in the paper industry. The social and cantonal unrest in Andalusia, such as Carmona, San Fernando, Sanlucar de Barrameda, Seville and M√°laga, were added to this conflict. Still, Pi y Margall refused to declare the state of emergency proposed by the \\"moderate\\" sector of his party, which included the suspension of the Cortes, because he trusted that the rapid approval of the federal Constitution and the way of dialogue would bring the rebels into reason. However, he did not hesitate to suppress the rebels, as evidenced by the telegram sent by the Minister of the Interior to all civil governors on 13 July, as soon as he became aware of the proclamation of the ‚ÄúMurcian Canton‚Äù the day before in Cartagena: But at the same time in the early morning of 14 July, Pi y Margall sent a long telegram to the civil governor of Murcia to try to convince the insurgents of the Canton of Cartagena that what they were doing was not defending the federal Republic but putting it in danger: Pi y Margall's policy of combining persuasion and repression to end the cantonal rebellion can also be seen in the instructions given to Republican General Ripoll, leading an army consisting of 1677 infantry, 357 horses and 16 pieces of artillery, from a base of operations in C√≥rdoba: On 14 July a debate took place in the Cortes at the proposal of the deputy for Cartagena, a federal Republican of the \\"moderate\\" sector, who after stating that \\"I have always been on the side of the policy represented by Mr. Pi y Margall\\" accused him of having crossed his arms - ‚ÄúA great way to make order!‚Äù he said - to which Pi replied that \\"the Government has not had weaknesses, what is lacking are material means\\". The next day Pi y Margall asked the Cortes to quickly discuss and approve the new Constitution in order to stop the continuation of the cantonal rebellion. Two days later, on 17 July, the Spanish Draft Constitution of 1873 had been written by Emilio Castelar, but three ‚ÄúIntransigent‚Äù members of the Constitutional Commission presented an alternative draft. In this climate of division Pi y Margall tried to form a new government that grouped all the sectors of the Chamber together. For this he asked for a vote of confidence, but he obtained the support of only 93 deputies, compared to 119 that the \\"moderate\\" Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n obtained. What had happened was that since Pi y Margall's policy of persuasion and repression had failed to stop the cantonal rebellion, the \\"moderate\\" sector had withdrawn its support by voting in favor of Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n. The next day Pi y Margall resigned after 37 days of office. On the same day of his resignation, 18 July, the ‚Äúintransigent‚Äù deputy Casalduero intervened. He accused Pi y Margall of having betrayed the ideas that he had defended until then - the construction of the Federation from the bottom up - and that he had been swept away by the \\"moderate\\" sector that advocated repression. A month and a half after having resigned, and when the Cortes were about to be suspended at the proposal of the new president Emilio Castelar, Pi y Margall explained to the House why at that time he had defended the federal construction from the top-down, and not from bottom-up as he had always advocated:  The government of Nicolas Salmeron and the repression of the cantonal movement  Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n Alonso, third president of the First Republic. Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n, elected President of the Executive Power with 119 votes in favor and 93 votes against, was a \\"moderate\\" federalist who defended the need to reach an understanding with conservative groups and a slow transition to the federal republic. As soon as he took office he replaced the Republican General Ripoll - appointed by Pi y Margall - with General Manuel Pavia, of doubtful loyalty to the Federal Republic, at the head of the expeditionary army of Andalusia. When, on 19 July, Salmer√≥n met with Pavia to offer him the position, he said, according to Pavia himself: ‚ÄúIf you get a soldier to fire his rifle against a cantonalist, order will have been saved‚Äù, which contrasts with the instructions Pi y Margall gave to Ripoll.  The formation of the provisional Government of the Spanish Federation  The ascendence of Salmer√≥n to the presidency of the Executive Power caused an intensification of the cantonal rebellion because the \\"intransigents\\" thought that with him it would be impossible to even reach the Federal Republic \\"from above\\", as Pi y Margall had assured them. They resolved that through the route of the cantonal insurrection, they would finally bring down the centralist political system of a unitary republic and establish \\"from below\\" the federal political system in Spain, that was previously proclaimed on 8 June in the Constituent Courts. The Decree of 20 July, by which the Government of Salmer√≥n declared the cantonal warships to be pirates, produced a response on 22 July, whereby the cantonalists declared the government of Madrid a traitor. On 24 July, in agreement with the intransigent deputies and the Junta of Cartagena, they created the ‚ÄúProvisional Directory‚Äù as the superior authority to give unity and cohesion to the cantonal movement, and extend it with the formation of new cantons. The Provisional Board of Directors was composed of three members: Juan Contreras, Antonio G√°lvez and Eduardo Romero Germes. Two days later the provisional Board of Directors was extended to nine components, incorporating the deputies Jos√© M¬™ P√©rez Rubio, Alberto Araus and Alfredo Sauvalle, the quarterback F√©lix Ferrer and the member of the Public Health Board of Madrid Nicol√°s Calvo Guayti. And finally on 27 July, the Provisional Junta became the ‚ÄúProvisional Government of the Spanish Federation‚Äù. The extension and the intensification of the rebellion Seal of the Valencian federal canton. After the formation of the Salmer√≥n government, the extension of the cantonal movement took place, so that by 23 July the insurrection had already extended to the regions of Andalusia and Levante, and even to the provinces of Salamanca and √Åvila. When added to the Carlist conflict, this meant that thirty-two provinces of Spain were up in arms. On 17 July, during a massive act of homage to the ‚ÄúVolunteers of the Republic‚Äù who had returned by train to combat the Internationalists in Alcoy, the crowd harangued by Rep. Feliu shouted \\"Long live the Valencian Canton!\\". The next day the militia was deployed to the strategic points of the city and at 11pm the proclamation of Valencian Canton was already a fact. On 19 July, the members of the \\"Revolutionary Junta\\" of the Canton were elected and chaired by Pedro Barrientos, a professor at the School of Fine Arts, while the civil governor Castej√≥n fled to Alcira by train. On 22 July, when 178 towns in the province of Valencia had already joined the Canton, the president of the Junta made the official proclamation of the Valencian Canton in the Plaza of Valencia, which was renamed ‚Äúthe Plaza of the Federal Republic‚Äù. Then 28 militia battalions without weapons were paraded and the La Marseillaise anthem was played. In an address the \\"Revolutionary Junta\\" reaffirmed its commitment to the maintenance of order: A day earlier, on 21 July, the federal deputy Francisco Gonz√°lez Cherm√° had left Valencia, in charge of 100 volunteers, two companies of police and one of infantry to proclaim the Canton of Castell√≥n. When he arrived in Castell√≥n de la Plana he dissolved the Provincial Council and proclaimed the Canton, but unlike what happened in the province of Valencia the towns of the province of Castell√≥n opposed cantonalism, since many of them were Carlists. This made the rapid dissolution of the canton by conservative forces possible. Gonz√°lez Cherm√° managed to escape by train to Valencia. The canton of Castell√≥n lasted only five days, from 21 to 26 July 1873. On 19 July, the canton of C√°diz was proclaimed as soon as the Government of Salmer√≥n had been formed. The consul of the United States in the city sent a report to his government describing what happened as ¬´ a real revolution ¬ª. The Public Health Committee, chaired by Fermin Salvochea, reported that it had been constituted \\"in order to save the federal Republic, supporting the movement initiated in Cartagena, Seville and other towns.\\" Both the civil and military governors joined the insurrection and the cantonal red flag began to fly in all official buildings. From the Canton of Seville they received abundant war material and their position was reinforced with the incorporation of La Linea de la Concepcion and San Fernando, but not so the naval base whose commander \\"awaits orders from Madrid\\". When C√°diz was bombed from La Carraca, the Public Health Committee accused the seafarers of wanting to ‚Äúbully the people, conclude with the national freedoms and obtain promotions and decorations at the cost of our blood ¬ª. On 21 July, the Canton of M√°laga was proclaimed. Although since the proclamation of the Federal Republic the previous month, M√°laga was already practically independent from the central power thanks to the unwritten pact between Francisco Solier, one of the leaders of the M√°laga ‚Äúintransigents‚Äù, and the government of Pi y Margall, who after appointing Solier civil governor, only demanded in return that they maintain normal relations with the Government. On 25 July, at the meeting to elect the members of the Public Health Committee, several dozens of ‚Äúintransigent‚Äù Republicans from the Carvajal sector were arrested and the next day 45 of them were deported to Melilla . Other uprisings occurred in Andalusia with the proclamations of the cantons of Seville (19 July) and Granada (on 20th July), as well as in Loja, Bail√©n, And√∫jar, Tarifa and Algeciras. In the Murcia Region there were proclamations of cantons in Almansa and in Jumilla, although there are doubts about the existence of the latter. The cantonal rebellion also occurred in some places in the provinces of Salamanca and Toledo. In Extremadura, the attempt to constitute cantons in Coria, Herv√°s and Plasencia, as well as the publication of the newspaper El Cant√≥n Extreme√±o, on whose pages the creation of the canton linked to Lusitania was encouraged and readers were urged to take up arms, if necessary, to defend these ideals. According to Jorge Vilches, ¬´common points in the cantonal declarations were the abolition of unpopular taxes, such as the consumption tax on tobacco and salt, the secularization of the goods of the clergy, the establishment of measures favorable to the workers, the pardon of prisoners for crimes against the State, the replacement of the Army by the militia and the formation of committees of public health ¬ª.  The maritime and land expeditions of the Canton of Cartagena  Ironclad warship Numancia, flagship of the cantonal fleet. The maritime and land expeditions undertaken by the Canton of Cartagena had two essential objectives. Firstly, to extend the rebellion thus making it possible to distract enemy forces and break their presumed encirclement; and secondly, to provide subsistence to the 9,000-strong forces concentrated in Cartagena, in addition to providing the necessary money to cope with war expenses, because the resources obtained in Cartagena itself were insufficient. The first maritime expedition took place on 20 July, in a simultaneous action by the paddle steamer Fernando el Cat√≥lico under General Contreras towards Mazarr√≥n and Eagles on the Murcian coast, and the ironclad warship Vitoria under the command of \\"Antonete\\" G√°lvez towards Alicante. In principle the two missions were successful as Mazarr√≥n and √Åguilas joined the Murcian Canton and G√°lvez proclaimed the Canton of Alicante, establishing a Public Health Board. But three days after the return of the Vitoria to Cartagena, the \\"centralist\\" authorities regained control of Alicante and dissolved the canton. Galvez returned in the Vigilante, which was requisitioned in the port of Alicante, and made a stop in Torrevieja where a commission met him to join the Murcian Canton, ceasing to belong to the province of Alicante. But when on 23 July the Vigilante was about to enter Cartagena, he was intercepted by the armored frigate using the decree just approved by the government of Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n that declared \\"pirates\\" of all ships flying the red cantonal flag, so they could be captured by ships of any country within even the Spanish jurisdictional waters. In addition the commodore Reinhold von Werner, commander of the \\"Friedrich Carl\\", demanded the delivery of the frigate \\"Vitoria\\" because she had also raised the red flag. Finally the Cartagena Board handed over the Vigilante to Werner, but not the Vitoria that was safe at the port. Meanwhile, in Murcia, the first major land expedition was organized for Lorca, a city that did not want to join the Canton of Cartagena, as Totana and Alhama had already done, after they were helped by a column of volunteers. The cantonal force composed of 2,000 men and four pieces of artillery, under the command of \\"Antonete\\" Galvez, arrived on 25 July raising the flag in the City Hall and establishing a Public Salvation Board. But the Murcian canton in Lorca only lasted one day because as soon as Galvez's forces returned to Murcia on the 26th, with several thousand pesetas as a war contribution, the local authorities that had left the city returned and dismissed the Junta. The second maritime expedition aimed to revolt the Andalusian coast from Almer√≠a to M√°laga. On 28 July, under the command of General Contreras the steam frigate Almansa and the Vitoria left Cartagena, acclaimed by the crowd, with two regiments on board plus a Marine infantry battalion. When the next day the expedition arrived at Almer√≠a, Contreras demanded a commission of representatives of the Provincial Council and the City Council who proposed on board the Numancia the payment of 500,000 pesetas as a war contribution and the abandonment of the city of military forces so that the people could freely decide whether to proclaim the Canton or not. The response was negative and the local authorities prepared the defense of the square, while the majority of Almer√≠a's civilian population left the city. On the morning of the 30th, the bombing of the city defenses and military buildings began, which was answered from Almeria. The city did not give up, so General Contreras that same night set course for Motril on the coast of Granada where he arrived at dawn the next day. Contreras landed the injured, visited the city and received financial aid in the form of promissory notes to be paid in M√°laga for an amount of 160,000 reales. On 1 August when the Almansa was in the waters of M√°laga it was flanked by the British ironclad warship and German , that in application of Salmer√≥n's \\"piracy decree\\" forced it to return, along with the Vitoria that had lagged behind - the reason they argued was that the Cantonal frigates were preparing to bomb M√°laga. Upon arriving at Escombreras, near Cartagena, the crews of the two frigates were forced to disembark and unload the cannons while General Contreras remained detained in the \`\`Friedrich Carl, although he was released shortly thereafter. The Almansa and the Vitoria remained in British custody and were taken to Gibraltar where they would be returned to the Spanish government. The second land expedition was organized in Cartagena on 30th July and was aimed at Orihuela, a city of Carlist predominance. It was sent, as the first terrestrial expedition to Lorca, by \\"Antonete\\" G√°lvez and had forces from Cartagena - the Iberia and Mendigorr√≠a regiments - and from Murcia - a body of volunteers under the command of a brother-in-law from G√°lvez. They entered the city at dawn, facing civilian guards and police officers ready for their defense. In the fighting, five guards were killed and nine were injured, while the cantonalists saw one dead and three injured. 14 civilians and 40 police officers were taken prisoner. After their victory in the so-called ‚Äúbattle of Orihuela‚Äù, they returned to Cartagena the next day, along with the civil guards and police who were carrying prisoners. There the cantonalist general F√©lix Ferrer addressed the following congratulations: At the beginning of August, \\"Antonete\\" G√°lvez and General Contreras headed a third land expedition, composed of 3000 men distributed in three trains, in the direction of Chinchilla to cut off the general Arsenio Mart√≠nez Campos‚Äô railroad communication with Madrid. The first skirmishes took place at the Chinchilla railway station, where the cantonalists manage to evict the troops sent by Mart√≠nez Campos, upon learning of the cantonalist's plans. But when the cantonalists received the news that the canton of Valencia had fallen, they withdrew. The \\"centralist\\" forces counterattacked, supported by artillery, which caused panic and disruption within the Murcian canton. Finally G√°lvez and Contreras managed to reorganize their forces, receiving the help of a reserve column that had been left in Hell√≠n. They returned to Murcia where they arrived on the night of 10 August. The battle of Chinchilla was a disaster for the Murcian canton because they lost about 500 men, including 28 chiefs and officers, in addition to 51 wagons, four guns and 250 rifles, and especially because it left Martinez Campos free to occupy Murcia.  The repression of the cantonal movement  The motto of the government of Salmer√≥n was the \\"rule of law\\", which meant that in order to save the Republic and the liberal institutions it was necessary to finish off the Carlists and Cantonalists. To quell the cantonal rebellion he took tough measures such as dismissing the civil governors, mayors and military who had somewhat supported the cantonalists and then appointed generals opposed to the Federal Republic such as Manuel Pavia or Arsenio Mart√≠nez Campos to send military expeditions to Andalusia and Valencia, respectively. \\"In addition, he mobilized the reservists, bolstered the Civil Guard with 30,000 men and appointed Government delegates in the provinces with the same powers as the Executive. He authorized the Provinces to impose war contributions and organize provincial armed bodies, and decreed that the ships held by the Canton of Cartagena be considered pirates - which meant that any vessel could take them down whether they were in Spanish waters or not\\". Thanks to these measures, the different cantons submitted one after another, except that of Cartagena which would resist until January 12 of 1874. General Manuel Pav√≠a. General Manuel Pavia and the forces that were under his command departed on 21 July from Madrid for Andalusia on two trains, although they did not arrive in C√≥rdoba until two days later because the route was intercepted in Despe√±aperros which forced them to deviate through Ciudad Real and Badajoz. The day before his arrival, General Ripoll, who was to be relieved by General Pavia, had managed to disrupt the attempt to proclaim the canton of C√≥rdoba by the \\"Volunteers of the Republic\\" who had come to the capital from the towns of the province, although the merit was attributed later by General Pavia, who said that the cantonalist forces dissolved when their arrival in the Cordoba capital took place. The first step Pavia took was to restore the discipline of the troops using expeditious methods and then prepared to attack the canton of Seville because its fall would demoralize the rest of the cantons of Andalusia. Pavia's troops left C√≥rdoba for Seville on July 26. After two days of heavy fighting on the morning of July 30, he occupied the City Hall, although the control of the city was not completed until the next day, at the cost of 300 casualties - the cantonal casualties were many more but nobody accounted for them. The next day, August 1, Pavia made his official entry into Seville, and some of his troops were sent to the towns of the province to proceed to disarm the forces of the Canton of Seville whose capital had just fallen.  The Canton of Cartagena, the last stronghold of the rebellion   The siege of Cartagena by the government of Emilio Castelar  Emilio Castelar, fourth president of the Executive Power of the First Spanish Republic On September 7, 1873, Emilio Castelar was elected to occupy the Presidency of the Executive Power, when the cantonal rebellion was practically finished, with the exception of the last stronghold of the Cartagena. Castelar had been deeply impressed by the disorder caused by the cantonal rebellion. Thus he valued much later what the cantonal rebellion had meant for the country, according to him: Only two days after being sworn in as President of the Executive Branch, Castelar obtained from the Cortes, thanks to the absence of the \\"intransigents\\", the granting of extraordinary powers, equal to those requested by Pi y Margall to fight the Carlists in the Basque country and Catalonia, but now extended to all of Spain to end both the Carlist war and the cantonal rebellion. The next step was to propose the suspension of the Cortes sessions, which among other consequences would paralyze the debate and the approval of the draft federal Constitution. On September 18, the proposal was approved with the votes of the \\"moderate\\" federal republicans and the opposition of the \\"centrists\\" of Pi y Margall and the \\"intransigents\\", who had returned to the House. Thus, the Cortes were suspended from September 20, 1873 until January 2, 1874. The extraordinary powers that Castelar obtained and the suspension of the sessions of the Cortes allowed him to govern by decree, a faculty that he immediately used to reorganize the artillery corps, to call the reservists and summon an army of 200,000 men, and ask for a loan of 100 million pesetas to meet the war expenses. On the same day, September 18, when the Cortes voted to suspend their sessions, the newspaper ‚Äò‚ÄòEl Cant√≥n Murciano‚Äô‚Äô in Cartagena published the address that \\"Antonete\\" G√°lvez had addressed to the cantonalist troops when he was appointed general commander of the citizen forces: ¬´to whoever tells you that this place will be handed over, immediately apprehend him, for he is a traitor. This square will never be handed over. ‚Äù The morale of the 75,000 inhabitants of Cartagena at that time was still high, as shown by this song that was sung throughout the city: Caricature of Castelar in \\"The Political Skein\\", by Tom√°s Padr√≥ Pedret, November 1873. Around that time, the cantonal five-peseta coins began to circulate, replacing the two-peseta coins that had been minted in early September, and which had a higher intrinsic value than was attributed to them. In the decree of the Junta in which its coinage was approved it was said: ‚Äú[Cartagena] wants to be the first to spread a living testimony of imperishable memory throughout the world that remind future generations of the cry of justice and brotherhood. ' At the end of October and beginning of November 1873 the first signs of fatigue appeared among the population, due to the long siege to which Cartagena had been subjected since mid-August. Thus on November 2 a demonstration demanded the holding of elections, to which the Sovereign Salvation Junta agreed, but its result did not change the composition of the Junta. Meanwhile, General Ceballos managed to introduce spies and agent-provocateurs into the city, who come to offer money to the leaders of the canton, which they rejected, although some officers were arrested and imprisoned on November 21 for accepting it. The discouragement and demoralization of the besieged increased when the bombing of the city began in late November. On November 14 the Minister of War Jos√© S√°nchez Bregua informed General Ceballos that \\"It would be convenient to throw 5,000 projectiles into the plaza because that way the defenders' spirits could be broken or at least disturbed, so as not to allow them to remain as they have remained, completely calm.\\" The bombing began on November 26, 1873 without warning and lasted until the last day of the siege, accounting for a total of 27,189 projectiles, \\"a true deluge of fire\\", which caused 800 wounded and twelve deaths and damage to most properties - only 28 houses were left unscathed. After the first week of bombardment in which the besiegers realized that Cartagena's defenses were still intact, General Ceballos resigned, alleging health reasons and the \\"lack of resources to take the place in the period that interests the Government\\" That is to say, before the Cortes was reopened on January 2, when it was expected Castelar would be forced to resign. On December 10 he was replaced by general Jos√© L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez.  The surrender of Cartagena after Pavia‚Äôs coup  Entry of the troops of Manuel Pav√≠a in the Congress of Deputies on January 3 of 1874. The approach of the constitutionalists and the radicals of Castelar met with the opposition of the \\"moderate\\" Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n and his followers, who until then had supported the government, because they believed that the Republic should be built by ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù republicans, not by the newcomers that were \\"out of republican orbit.\\" The first sign that Salmer√≥n had stopped supporting the Castelar government came in December 1873 when his supporters in the Cortes voted along with ‚Äúcentrists‚Äù and \\"intransigents\\" against Castelar's proposal that elections be held to fill the vacant seats. Following Castelar's parliamentary defeat, Cristino Martos, leader of the radicals, and General Serrano, leader of the constitutionalists, agreed to carry out a coup d'√©tat to prevent Castelar from being replaced at the head of the Executive Branch by a vote of censure that Pi y Margall and Salmer√≥n were expected to present as soon as the Cortes reopened on January 2, 1874 . When the Cortes reopened on January 2, 1874, the captain general of Madrid, Manuel Pav√≠a, the military man who was going to lead the coup, had his troops ready in case Castelar lost the parliamentary vote. On the opposite side, battalions of ‚Äò‚ÄòVolunteers of the Republic‚Äô‚Äô were prepared to act if Castelar won - in fact, according to Jorge Vilches, \\"the Cartagena cantonalists had received a call to resist until January 3, the day that an intransigent government would form that would \\"legalize\\" their situation and \\"cantonalize\\" Spain ¬ª. When the session opened, Nicol√°s Salmer√≥n intervened to announce that he was withdrawing his support for Castelar. Emilio Castelar replied, calling for the establishment of the \\"possible Republic\\" with all the liberals, including the conservatives, and abandoning demagoguery. This was followed by a vote in which the Castelar government was defeated by 100 votes in favor and 120 against. Then the constitutional deputy Fernando Le√≥n y Castillo forwarded the result to General Pav√≠a, who gave the order to lead the compromised regiments to the Congress of Deputies. It was five minutes to seven in the morning, when the vote was going to elect the federal candidate Eduardo Palanca Asensi. When Salmer√≥n received the order from the captain general in a note delivered by one of his assistants in which he told him to \\"vacate the premises,\\" he suspended the vote and reported the extremely serious incident to the deputies. Shortly thereafter, the Civil Guard forced entry into the Congress building, firing shots into the air throughout the corridors, causing almost all deputies to leave. Castelar declined General Pavia's offer to preside over the government because he was unwilling to remain in power through undemocratic means, so the presidency of the Executive Power of the Republic and the government was assumed by the leader of the Constitutional Party Francisco Serrano, Duke of la Torre, who set himself the priority objective of ending the cantonal rebellion and the Third Carlist War. In the Manifesto that he made public on January 8, 1874, he justified the Pavia coup, stating that the government that was going to replace Castelar's would have caused the dismemberment of Spain or the triumph of Carlist absolutism and then announced, leaving all possibilities open: Hereditary or elective Republic or Monarchy, which would convene an ordinary Courts that would designate the \\"form and manner in which they are to elect the supreme Magistrate of the Nation, marking their powers and electing the first to occupy such high office\\". Due to the establishment of the Serrano dictatorship - the Cortes continued to be dissolved and the Constitution of 1869 was reinstated, but was subsequently suspended \\"until the normality of political life was assured\\" - it met with popular resistance in Barcelona where on January 7 and 8 barricades were erected and a general strike was declared. There were a dozen victims in the clashes with the army and the most serious events occurred in Sarri√° due to an uprising led by the \\"Xich de les Barraquete\\" commanded by about 800 men. On January 10, the Serrano government decreed the dissolution of the Spanish section of the International Workingmen's Association (AIT) for \\"violating property, the family and other social bases\\". Immediately the Civil Guard occupied all its premises and the internationalist newspapers were suspended. General Jos√© L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez in 1897. When the coup of Pavia became known in Cartagena, the besieged lost all hope that their cause could triumph due to what they considered capitulation, although \\"stimulated by the terror that announces the next defeat, the cantons make a desperate and heroic defense, as recognized by the general Jos√© L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez himself\\", commanded by the government army that was laying siege to the plaza. At 11 o'clock on the morning of January 6, the artillery park's powder deposit exploded, killing the 400 people who had taken refuge there because the park was beyond the reach of enemy cannons. There is doubt if the explosion was caused by a projectile launched by the besiegers or if it was sabotage. It was the definitive blow to the capacity of resistance of the besieged and neither \\"Antonete\\" G√°lvez nor General Contreras \\"managed to raise the spirits of that people subjected to unrelenting punishment.\\" On the afternoon of January 11, a large assembly was held in which, in addition to the members of the Junta, the military, volunteers and mobilized participated. In it, it was decided on the proposal of Roque Barcia to surrender and the Revolutionary Junta commissioned Don Antonio Bonmat√≠ i Caparr√≥s, on behalf of the Spanish Red Cross, to parley with the head of the government army and offer the surrender of the square, despite the fact that the rest of the leaders of the Murciano Canton of Cartagena, including \\"Antonete\\" G√°lvez and General Contreras, continued to resist. Shortly afterwards, a commission from the assembly led by two representatives of the Red Cross surrendered to General L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez. At 9 in the morning of the following day, January 12, the counterproposal was read before the assembly, which took the commission to the conditions required by L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez in his interview the previous day, and which also included the acceptance of the pardon for the crime of rebellion that L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez had offered them, with the exception of the members of the Junta, that the prisoners of war made in Chinchilla be included in the pardon and that they recognize the degrees and jobs granted during the insurrection, among other requests. While the commission was parliamentary with General L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez, most of the members of the Junta, led by \\"Antonete\\" G√°lvez and General Contreras, along with hundreds of cantonalistas who also wanted to escape, boarded the frigate. Numancia and left the port of Cartagena at five in the afternoon on that day, January 12, managing to evade the siege of the Government fleet thanks to its great speed and the ability of its captain, heading to Oran, where they arrived the next day. Meanwhile, the commission returned to Cartagena with the conditions for surrender offered by General L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez, which had not varied substantially from the initial ones, as the Board members who escaped supposed. The commission informed the besieged that the general would no longer negotiate and that he had given them a term to accept their conditions, which would end at 8 am the next day, January 13. Once these were accepted, General L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez entered Cartagena that day at the head of his troops. He was promoted to lieutenant general and received the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand.  Repression  The terms of the capitulation of Cartagena granted by General L√≥pez Dom√≠nguez were considered \\"reasonable\\" given the customs in use at the time, since those who surrendered arms within the plaza, both chief and officer classes, and individuals from sea and land troops, armed, volunteer and mobilized institutes, were pardoned, \\"with the exception of those who compose or have formed part of the Revolutionary Junta\\". Instead, the Minister of the Interior, the unitary republican Eugenio Garc√≠a Ruiz, who was proposed for the post by General Pav√≠a, acted with a \\"special fury against the federalists\\". He even tried to banish Francesc Pi y Margall who had had nothing to do with the cantonal rebellion, but this was not achieved because the rest of the Serrano government opposed it. \\"Garc√≠a Ruiz was a unitary and anti-federalist who had been attacking Pi y Margall in the House and in the press for years. Pi's firmness in his convictions, his inflexible character and perhaps even his status as a Catalan irritated Garc√≠a Ruiz, who upon being appointed Minister of the Interior believed he found the opportunity to re- express his hatred against federalism in a reliable way. \\" Garc√≠a Ruiz imprisoned and deported hundreds of anonymous people without any other charge than that of being \\"cantonalists\\", \\"internationalists\\" or simply \\"agitators\\", and without the records of whether or not they were put on trial. Most of the deportees were sent to the Spanish colony of the Mariana Islands located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean 3000 kilometers away from the Philippine Islands - which also received \\"cantonal\\" deportees - so they were practically isolated and their families had no news of them. They presented numerous requests to the authorities, requesting that their whereabouts be ascertained - and that they are still preserved in the National Historical Archive -, which means that the authorities did not report the deaths. \\"In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, with a suffocating humid heat, due to its tropical situation, the deportees suffered many hardships.\\" Only one escape from the Mariana islands is known: eight prisoners who escaped \\"in one of the few fishing boats that, very occasionally, made a stop there\\". The official figure of those deported to the Marianas and the Philippines was 1,099, but there are no data on those who were deported to Cuba, nor on those who served sentences in Spanish prisons. As for the leaders of the cantonal movement, most escaped to Oran where they arrived on January 13, 1873. There they were detained by the French authorities until they were released on February 9. The frigate \\"Numancia\\" was returned to the Spanish government on January 17, but not the people traveling on board as the Spanish representatives intended. The Bourbon Restoration in Spain allowed Antonete G√°lvez, through amnesty, to return to his native Torreag√ºera. At this time he would establish a strange and intimate friendship with Antonio C√°novas del Castillo, the person in charge of the Restoration, who considered Galvez a sincere, honest and brave man, although with exaggerated political ideas. Roque Barcia did not flee on the frigate \\"Numancia\\", but only four days after the capitulation of Cartagena he published a document in the newspapers condemning the cantonal rebellion, despite being one of its main leaders and promoters. In the exculpatory letter he claimed that he was ‚Äúin Cartagena because they wouldn't let me out\\" and that he had been \\"a prisoner, more of the besieged than the besiegers.\\" And then he disqualified the cantonal movement and its leaders: ¬´All my companions were very holy, very just heroes, but they were not good for the government of a village. [...] Federal Republicans: for the time being, let's not insist on raising federalism. It is an idea that is in the making. [...] Without abjuring my ideas, being what I always was, I recognize the current Government and I will be with it in the fight against absolutism¬ª. According to Jos√© Bar√≥n Fern√°ndez, after writing this, \\"Roque Barcia was discredited, forever, as a politician\\" and \\"became what we now call a demagogue\\".  The role of the International in the rebellion  There has been a lot of discussion about the degree of participation of the International Workingmen's Association, but today it seems clear that the leaders of the International did not intervene in the cantonal rebellion and that the only place where internationalists took the initiative, in addition to the 'Petroleum Revolution' of Alcoy, was in San L√∫car de Barrameda ‚Äì there a board was formed that was actually the Council of the section Local of the International, after the closure of the social premises by order of the authorities‚Äî, as recognized in a letter dated August 4 Tom√°s Gonz√°lez Morago, member of the Federal Committee of the FRE-AIT: ¬´The federation of Alcoy and San Lucar de Barrameda are the only ones that have attempted on their own account a movement against the established order of things.\\" However, many \\"internationalists\\" participated in the rebellion, especially in Valencia and Seville, where some of them formed part of the Juntas. A letter from Francisco Tom√°s Oliver sent on August 5 to the IWA Commission recognized this: In a later letter, dated September 15, Tom√°s differentiated the Alcoy insurrection, \\"a purely working-class, revolutionary socialist movement\\", from the cantonal rebellion, a \\"purely political and bourgeois\\" movement, and affirmed that \\"Seville and Valencia are the only two cities in which the internationalists have triumphed\\", although he acknowledged that they had taken \\"a very active part in the events\\" in other towns, such as C√°diz, Granada, Jerez de la Frontera, San Fernando, Carmona, Lebrija, Paradas, Chipiona and San L√∫car de Barrameda, but that later had been \\"abandoned by the phonies\\". The consequence was that the repression also fell on the internationalists, especially after the formation of the government of Emilio Castelar. On August 16, 1873, \\"The Federation\\", an organ of the FRE- AIT, explained why in its opinion the cantonal rebellion had failed:  Bibliography      * See also * First Spanish Republic * Third Carlist War References External links *Cartagena-Cant√≥n-1873, a group making a historical reenactment of the canton of Cartagena.

He started dancing at age seven, after watching his older sister in her dance classes. He studied tap as well as ballet. He was soon being entered for the performing- arts competitions in Australia known as eisteddfods, often gracing 25 sections at a time. By his teens, already an extremely capable tapper, Steven McRae knew that his future lay in dance, and trained throughout high school. In 2002, at age 16, he won the gold medal at the 2002 Gen√©e held in Sydney that year. In 2003, at age 17, he won the Prix de Lausanne in Switzerland, earning a scholarship, and entered the Royal Ballet School in London. Career He graduated into The Royal Ballet in 2004 and was promoted to first artist in 2005, soloist in 2006, first soloist in 2008 and principal in 2009. The Guardian has called McRae \\"a modern-day Fred Astaire\\". In 2014, he was named \\"Young Australian Achiever of the Year in the UK\\" for his work with the Royal Ballet. First principal role In 2005, in his first season with the Royal Ballet, McRae jumped on the occasion to dance Symphonic Variations by Frederick Ashton, which is an iconic piece of the Royal Ballet. Symphonic Variations was Ashton's first work after World War II, and one of the Company's first to be performed on the huge main stage of the Royal Opera House.Royal Ballet: Dream/Symphonic Variations/Marguerite and Armand, announcement for the performance scheduled on 7 June 2017, Times.

The system was developed by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) with its joint venture partner Textron Systems as a part of the Non-Self-Destruct Alternative (NSD-A) program and is intended to replace the Matrix remote trigger system currently deployed in Iraq which works with pre-existing mines like the M18 Claymore. Day & Zimmermann and General Dynamics are prime subcontractors. Design M7 Spider MCU with 3 MGLs The system is composed of Munition Control Units (MCUs), a Remote Control Station (RCS), and a repeater for extending communication range. Up to 63 MCUs can be configured for each RCS. Each MCU can attach up to six Miniature Grenade Launchers (MGL) each of which covers a sixty degree arc. The MCUs are hand emplaced after which the operator can optionally command to deploy six triplines to provide a sensing network. The operator can be situated up to a mile away from the munition or further with the use of a repeater. When a tripline is activated, the MCU connected to the line signals wirelessly to the Remote Control Station using either the U.S. Army battlefield key management infrastructure or the Navy Electronic Key Management System (EKMS). The operator at the RCS can at that point choose to fire one or more of the attached munitions (grenades or other.)https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/wsh2011/wsh2011.pdf The MCU is powered by a replaceable battery, lasting for approximately 30 days. After being fired the system can be disabled and fitted with fresh grenades. The M-7 Spider can also be ordered to \\"zeroize\\", purge all data stored in its memory to prevent the systems from being removed by the enemy. Additionally, if the system is tampered with or transported while armed it will become disabled. The M7 Spider does not have the ability to self-destruct or become a victim activated mine or explosive device. An MCU can be used with a number of different sub-munitions; some of which are claimed to be \\"non-lethal\\". History Developed to bridge the gap between remote battlefield sensor and anti-personnel mines, the M7 Spider Networked Munition System was originally designed to be either victim activated or operator initiated. In accordance with the 2004 U. S. National Landmine Policy, The M7 Spider was permanently configured as a \\"Man-In-The-Loop\\" (MITL) weapon system with all victim activated capabilities removed. Wired reported in 2004 that the Army intended to purchase 290,000 spider munitions at a cost of $513 million US dollars. However, as of 2006 a total of $301 million has been budgeted to produce 907 Spider \\"systems\\", with an addition $11.8 million for ongoing research. The development costs for the system between 1999 and 2004 were $135 million. Assuming that a \\"system\\" consists of 84 MCUs, this gives an approximate cost of $5000 per MCU. As of August, 2013, the M7 Spider Networked Munition System has been granted full material release by the Department of the Army. Initially, full scale fielding will be to the Brigade Engineer Battalions in all Brigade Combat Teams, with follow-on fielding to all U. S. Army maneuver Battalions at a date to be determined.

Eton speakers inhabit the Leki√© department of the Centre Region of Cameroon, an area north of the capital Yaound√© bounded in the north by the Sanaga River. Ethnologue cites four dialects of Eton, but its speakers generally distinguish two, a northern and a southern dialect, the latter of which is closer to the Ewondo language. The Mengisa people have largely switched to Eton. A small number continue to speak their ancestral language, Leti. It is not clear if the ISO code for \\"Mengisa\\" refers to Eton or Leti; Ethnologue classifies Mengisa with Eton, but the code is likely based on Guthrie, who classified it with Leti.  Phonology  Eton is a tone language. It makes use of three tones (low, high and dissimilating high) and floating tones.  Grammar  Eton is an SVO language. As is common in Bantu, Eton has a noun class system. There are twelve classes and the class of a noun determines which agreement prefix it receives and triggers.

He was also one of the cofounders of the Oriental Missionary Society (now One Mission Society; formerly OMS International).  Early life  Charles Cowman was born on March 13, 1868, in Toulon, Illinois, to David and Mary Cowman. He grew up in the Methodist Episcopal Church. At age 15, he was offered and accepted a summer job as a telegraph operator at a local railway station. Excelling at this new job, he chose not to return to school the following fall and continued with his new profession. He received a number of promotions over the following years. At 18, he was transferred to a station in Chicago, and by the time he was 19, he earned a salary comparable to employees who had been working there for many years. On June 8, 1889, at 21 years old, he married childhood friend, Lettie Burd. During their first year of marriage, they moved to the Rocky Mountains in order to escape city life. When the high altitude caused Lettie to become very sick though, they returned to Chicago for the next 10 years.  Telegraphers‚Äô Mission Band  Upon their return to Chicago, Cowman continued his work at the telegraph office. His attitude had changed though since the last time he was there. After a strong conviction, Charles recommitted his life to God. ‚ÄúHe made it the first thing in his life to be a Christian, feeling he must concentrate all his energy upon it‚Äù (Page 19).Missionary Warrior, New Condensed Edition, OMS International, Inc., 1989. One way in which he did this was by forming the ‚ÄúTelegraphers‚Äô Mission Band\\" in Chicago with coworkers who had become Christians because of him. One member was Ernest A. Kilbourne, who would later become a cofounder of the Oriental Missionary Society. The Telegraphers‚Äô Mission Band sent letters explaining the Gospel to telegraphers all over the United States, Great Britain and Australia.  The Oriental Missionary Society  In the late 1890s, Cowman met and befriended Juji Nakada at his church, Grace Methodist Episcopal Church. Nakada had come from Japan to study at Moody Bible Institute. He, too, would later become a cofounder of the Oriental Missionary Society. Upon Nakada‚Äôs return to Japan, the Telegraphers‚Äô Mission Band began financially supporting him as a missionary, thus continuing the connection they had made with him while he was in the states. After feeling a deep call on their hearts, Charles and Lettie left America on February 1, 1901, to serve as missionaries in Japan. They worked alongside Nakada, with the dream of starting a Bible training institute. ‚ÄúThe aim of the institute would not be to produce classical scholars, but young men and women who could handle their mother tongue with effect, who were steeped in the Bible and who could so proclaim it as to arrest and influence all classes of people‚Äù (page 52). Within a few months of being in Japan, that dream became a reality when they were able to open a mission hall where Nakada could preach the Gospel message and train leaders. The hall held Bible classes in the daytime and was the venue for evangelistic services in the evening. This was the beginning of the Oriental Missionary Society. In 1902, Ernest Kilbourne joined Cowman and Nakada to assist in their growing ministry.  Electric Messages  A small monthly periodical called Electric Messages began being printed in November 1902. This was mailed to supporters in the United States and included monthly reports of the work that was being accomplished. The name was later changed to The O.M.S. Standard and is currently called OMS Outreach.  Tokyo Bible Training Institute  Having outgrown their original building, a need for a larger building for the Bible Training Institute arose in early 1903. By the end of 1903, a new school had opened in Tokyo, providing ample room to grow. The larger space not only accommodated more students, but also provided for great conventions and hundreds of guests.  Seoul Bible Training Institute  In 1904, two Koreans went to Japan to attend the Tokyo Bible Training Institute. Through these students, OMS began to make connections with Korea. By 1910, they were able to send two missionaries from England, John and Emily Thomas, to Korea. Shortly after their arrival, another Bible Training Institute opened, just outside Seoul. Similar to Japan‚Äôs school, the Seoul Bible Training Institute fostered much growth and transformation of the surrounding region.  The Great Village Campaign  Burdened by the number of people who remained unreached in Japan, Cowman began The Great Village Campaign in 1913. He had a vision ‚Äúwhereby every person in Japan might hear the Gospel in the next five years‚Äù (125). He could not rest until the entirety of Japan‚Äôs 58 million- person population was reached. Teams of missionaries visited every town, village and home throughout Japan, proclaiming the Gospel and distributing Bibles. Tokyo was the first to be visited, where 3 million Bibles were delivered. From there, workers went out among the provinces to continue with their goal of providing every home with a Bible. Toward the end of 1914, the hard work began to take a toll on Cowman‚Äôs health. He and Lettie returned to America for a short time in 1915 to rest and regain his health. The Village Campaign continued to progress while they were in the States, but soon enough, they returned to Japan to complete the work they had begun. 1917 posed to be the most intensive year of the campaign. In the spring, they went to the large island of Kyushu (home to 9,million residents) to establish temporary headquarters. As the year went on and the completion of the campaign drew near, Cowman once again became ill. He began to have many heart problems, leading Lettie and him to leave Japan for another few months. In January 1918, while at home in America, they received news through the O.M.S. Standard that the Japan Village Campaign was complete. About 60 million Japanese were equipped with the Gospel, covering of land (page 137).  Late Life  While back in America, Charles regained his health for a short time. He traveled for six months, telling the incredible story of The Great Village Campaign. He would have likely continued traveling the country, but numerous heart attacks forced him to rest at his home in California. For the next six years, he suffered in great pain, yet he always kept a positive attitude while continuing his work for the Lord. ‚ÄúAlthough broken in body, he kept an oversight of the home office and every department of work on the field, dictating letters by the hundreds‚Äù (page 142). He also began to make plans to go into China, so that another Bible training institute could be established. In March 1924, Cowman faithfully signed the bank books of OMS over to two trustees: Ernest Kilbourne and W.J. Clark, a Los Angeles businessman.  Death and The Cowman Memorial Bible Training Institute  On the night of July 17, 1924, Cowman experienced a stroke that paralyzed his entire left side. The doctors said he would only live a few more hours, but he lived a number of weeks more. He passed just after midnight on September 25, 1924 (page 153). Two days after his funeral, a letter came to him stating that a fellow worker was giving $25,000 to open a Bible Training Institute in China. One year later, in September 1925, the Bible Training Institute was up and running in Shanghai. It was fittingly named, ‚ÄúThe Cowman Memorial Bible Training Institute.‚Äù (page 155)  References   External links  * onemissionsociety.org Category:1868 births Category:1924 deaths Category:People from Toulon, Illinois Category:American Methodist missionaries Category:Methodist missionaries in Japan Category:American expatriates in Japan ","title":"Charles Cowman"},{"id":"32562158","text":"The 139th Intelligence Squadron (IS) is the newest unit of the Georgia Air National Guard, focusing on intelligence operations. The commander of the 44-member intelligence squadron is Lt. Col. Kimberly Chatfield, and the detachment commander is Lt. Col. Jeff L. Thetford, both former members of the 116th Air Control Wing. The unit will employ 37 traditional and seven full- time Guardsmen.  History  The 139th Intelligence Squadron was officially activated on May 29, 2008, at Fort Gordon, Georgia, becoming the ninth Air Guard unit in the state and the first new Georgia Air Guard unit in more than 30 years. The leadership was composed of an all woman team, the Commander, the Superintendent and the First Sergeant. Originally activated in February 1942 as the 139th Signal Radio Intelligence Company with a cadre of 13 intercept and traffic analysis operators, the unit was designated the 2nd Radio Signal Mobile in 1944, and a year later deployed to France with the 9th Air Force. The unit was later transferred to the Department of the Army where it operated under the Army Security Agency (ASA) while in Germany. In 1983, the unit was called to duty again during the Cold War and combined with the 6911th Electronic Security Squadron and re-designated as the 402nd Intelligence Squadron. In 2000, the 402nd was inactivated until it was reactivated as part of the Georgia Air National Guard.  Mission  The mission of the 139th Intelligence Squadron is the executing of cryptologic intelligence operations to satisfy strategic, operations and tactical intelligence requirements of national decision makers, combatant commanders and combat operations. The 139th IS enhances preexisting intelligence capabilities at Fort Gordon. As home of the U.S. Army Signal Corps, Fort Gordon is the largest communications electronics facility in the world. The Distributed Common Ground Systems for the Air Force also resides at Fort Gordon. In addition, the it has an important state mission of providing a trained and equipped force to assist the citizens of Georgia in times of emergency.  Emblem  Ultramarine blue and Air Force yellow are the Air Force colors. Blue alludes to the sky, the primary theater of Air Force operations. Yellow refers to the sun and the excellence required of Air Force personnel. The Cerberus symbolizes the three- fold nature of the unit‚Äôs National, Air Force and State intelligence missions. The gray ring represents the intellectually stimulating and changing nature of intelligence operations.

It is found in the south-eastern United States. Description The naked sand darter is a small fish ranging in size from 40 to 50 mm long, the maximum being around 64 mm. Being a long thin darter, it is devoid of scales with the exception of a few rows above and below the lateral line and sometimes the caudal peduncle. Slightly transparent in life with a yellow color and iridescent operculum, the naked sand darter blends in with its habitat. It has darker bands in the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins with a whitish base and tip. Males of breeding size with have a dark spot at the front of the dorsal fin. Unlike similar darters, it does not have an opercular spine. Diet Larvae of small fish are the primary source of food for naked sand darters. They also feed on smaller crustaceans like copepods or clam larvae depending on their size. Naked sand darters feed continuously throughout the day, but stop at night. They also feed less in winter and summer months then pick back up before and after breeding season. Habitat Naked sand darters prefer the sandy bottoms of clean, freshwater rivers and streams. They can be found about 1 m deep on the bottom, digging into the sand to wait for prey to swim by. Distribution They can be found exclusively along the Gulf of Mexico in the rivers and drainages of eastern Louisiana to as far east as the Mobile Bay drainage in Alabama. Naked sand darters have been found as far north as West Tennessee. Reproduction and lifecycle Breeding season is from March or April until September or October when water temperatures are between 17 and 29 ¬∞C. Males develop tubercles on their anal and pelvic fins to aid in fighting for females. Females can produce from 12‚Äì122 eggs at a time and reach sexual maturity after a year. They only live 24 to 30 months. Taxonomy and etymology The naked sand darter was first formally described in 1877 by the American ichthyologist David Starr Jordan (1851-1931) with the type locality given as the Natalbany River, near Tickfaw, Louisiana. It is the type species of the genus Ammocrypta, which Jordan also originally described. The genus name, Ammocrypta, comes from the Greek word ammos meaning sand and the Greek kryptos meaning hidden. The specific name, beanii, comes from the first collector of the species, Tarleton H. Bean (1846-1915).

Opened in 1872, it forms the junction between the Arlberg railway and the Vorarlberg railway. The station is also a terminus of the Bludenz‚ÄìSchruns railway. It is owned and operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB). Location Bludenz railway station is situated in Bahnhofplatz, right in the heart of the city, on the east bank of the Ill river. Like the river, the lines passing through the station run in a north west - south easterly direction at this point. The station building is on the northeastern side of the lines, facing the inner city. On the other, southwestern, side of the lines is the goods yard. Features Station building The old station building is laid out in a plan of three axes. The three key parts of the building are arranged with eaves facing each other, and are connected by a structure running parallel to the running line. Extending along this structure, on the forecourt side, is a recently constructed large canopy. Inside the building, apart from the typical station facilities, are offices and a canteen for railway workers. Station yard Bludenz has unusually extensive railway facilities. The station yard covers an area of approximately 200 ha. For passenger traffic, there are a main platform and two other platforms with a total of four tracks. In addition, there are two stub sidings one at the northwest end of the yard, and the other at the southeast ends. In the centre of the yard there is a through track. In the northwest corner, since the introduction of a second running line completed from Bregenz only in 1995, there are several tracks for stabling locomotives and railcars. South of that point there is a new motive power depot with ten tracks. Eight sidings are provided for goods traffic. Renovations After twelve years of discussion, the City of Bludenz decided on 26 September 2008 that the station area would be renovated. One effect of the renovations would be that individual motorised traffic near the station would largely disappear. Apart from the station forecourt, the barracks room to its north would be modified, and the workers' room rebuilt. The project was expected to be completed in 2011.

It is native to the central United States. Distribution The western sand darter occurs in river systems from Lake Michigan to Texas, including several sections of the Mississippi Basin. Its range extends as far east as the Elk River in West Virginia. Distribution map Description This species is up to 7.1 centimeters in length. It is slender and nearly cylindrical in shape. It is pale, translucent silvery white with yellowish coloration along the back. It is distinguished from other sand darters the lack of dark bands or blotches, and by a spine on its operculum. Biology This fish lives in medium and large rivers, over sandy and gravel substrates. It requires loose substrate, because it spends much of its time buried in the sand with just its head protruding. This behavior helps it reach cooler temperatures. It feeds on invertebrates, especially the larvae of aquatic insects. It spawns in summer, starting in June in northern regions and May farther south. Females produce an average of 57 eggs at a time, with larger females producing more eggs. Taxonomy The Western sand darter was first formally described in 1885 by the American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan ((1851-1931) and Seth Eugene Meek (1859-1914) with the type locality given as the Des Moines River at Ottumwa, Iowa. This species forms a clade with the naked sand darter (A. beanii) the Florida sand darter (A. bifascia). Conservation This is considered to be a vulnerable species because it has a fragmented distribution and its habitat is degraded in many areas. Increased silt and pollution in river systems reduces the quality of its habitat. The Mississippi River and associated streams and tributaries are heavily channelized and partitioned by locks and dams, eliminating sites where the fish might live.

During breeding, the male has bright blue patches on its head and other areas.Etheostoma akatulo. FishBase. This fish is found only in the Caney Fork River system, a tributary of the Cumberland River in Tennessee. The species name akatulo comes from the Cherokee for \\"mask\\", referring to the solid blue coloration on the lower face of the fish. Anatomy and appearance The species differs from other species of the subgenus Doration by having fully scaled cheeks, complete lateral line, breeding males with bright blue pigment completely covering the lower face, and breeding males with soft dorsal and anal fins lacking orange and blue pigment. Geographic distribution Etheostoma akatulo is known from five small rivers and large creeks of the upper Caney Fork River system, Tennessee, including Collins River, Rocky River, Calfkiller River, Cane Creek, and upper Caney Fork River. Etheostoma akatulo is most abundant and widely distributed in Collins River, where it occurs in a 37-km reach between Shellsford, Warren Co., and Tennessee Highway 56, 1.2 km east of Mt. Olive, Grundy Co. In Rocky River, the species inhabits only a 4.3-km reach from Tennessee Highway 30 upstream to Laurelburg Road ford, Van Buren Co., including a 1.7-km reach that alternates between backwater and free-flowing conditions as Great Falls Reservoir fluctuates between maximum (244 m) and minimum (240 m) pool elevations.Layman Steven R.; Simons Andrew M.; Wood Robert M.(1993). Status of the dirty darter, Etheostoma olivaceum and bluemask darter, Etheostoma (Doration) sp., with notes on fishes of the Caney Fork River System, Tennessee. Journal of the Tennessee Academy of Science Volume: 68 Issue: 2 Pages: 65-70. In Cane Creek, recent collections are from the lower 200 m of free-flowing waters in Van Buren Co. In upper Caney Fork River, the species has been collected in an intermittent reach located only 1.8 river km upstream of reservoir maximum pool in White Co. Etheostoma akatulo is restricted in distribution to the Caney Fork River system in free-flowing streams upstream of Great Falls. All four extant populations apparently are isolated from one another by the impounded waters of Great Falls Reservoir. Ecology Not much is known about the ecology of Etheostoma akatulo. All darters, as their name implies, dart about on the bottoms of streams and eat small crustaceans and insects.http://www.fws.gov/cookeville/docs/bluemask.htm Etheostoma akatulo occurs in slow to moderate current over sand and fine gravel at depths of 10‚Äì50 cm, typically just downstream of riffles, in runs, or along margins of pools. During spawning Etheostoma akatulo males and females have been seen occupying different microhabitats. Substrate dominated by gravel were occupied by lone males and spawning pairs, whereas most lone females were found over a sand-dominant substrate.Simmons Jeffrey W.; Layzer James B.(2004). Spawning behavior and habitat of the endangered bluemask darter, Etheostoma (Doration) sp. Copeia Volume: 2004 Issue: 2 Pages: 412-417. After the spawning period, Bluemask Darters move to sandy substrates in low-velocity areas of intermediate depth.Layzer James B.; Brady Tony R.(2003). Summer microhabitat of the endangered bluemask darter Etheostoma (Doration) sp. Journal of the Tennessee Academy of Science Volume: 78 Issue: 2 Pages: 55-57. Life history The life cycle of Etheostoma akatulo has been compared to that of Etheostoma stigmaeum.Simmons, J W; Layzer, J B.(2003). Reproductive ecology of the endangered bluemask darter, Etheostoma [Doration] sp. Southeastern Biology, 50(2): p. 160 Etheostoma akatulo, before it was formally described, was once considered a subspecies of Etheostoma stigmaeum. E. stigmaeum is known to lay its eggs in gravelly areas and after they have been laid, it covers them with the gravel. Etheostoma akatulo is believed to demonstrate the same egg laying behavior. E. akatulo can live to be 39 months old. They show the highest amount of growth during the first year of life but do not reach sexual maturity until year two.Simmons Jeffrey W.; Layzer James B.; Smith David D.(2008). Age-class Structure and Variability of Two Populations of the Bluemask Darter Etheostoma (Doration) sp. American Midland Naturalist Volume: 160 Issue: 2 Pages: 300-309. Management Etheostoma akatulo was listed as a federally endangered species in 1993. Existing and potential threats to continued survival of the species include habitat destruction from gravel dredging, which has already eliminated habitat once occupied by the species in Collins River; pesticides in runoff or groundwater from plant nurseries; siltation from gravel mining, agricultural runoff, or land-disturbing activities; and acid mine drainage from headwater streams. The most significant factor contributing to the bluemask darter's decline was likely the building of the Great Falls Dam. The reservoir impounded by the dam flooded over 80 kilometers of possible bluemask darter habitat and isolated the tributary populations from each other. Because of the isolation, the genetic viability over a long period of time is questionable for the species. One of the current plans for management is the reintroduction of Etheostoma akatulo to the Calfkiller River. Because of gravel dredging the substrate in Calfkiller River is not ideal so first they are making new sand and gravel substrates. Then, the reintroduction of the fish will begin.

He founded Giving What We Can, an international society whose members pledge to donate at least 10% of their income to effective charities, and is a key figure in the effective altruism movement, which promotes using reason and evidence to help the lives of others as much as possible. He is a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, where his work is focused on existential risk. His book on the subject‚ÄîThe Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity‚Äîwas published in March 2020.  Career  Ord attended the University of Melbourne, where he initially studied computer science. On completing his first degree, he switched to studying philosophy to pursue his interest in ethics: \\"At this stage I knew that I wanted to make a large positive difference in the world and it seemed that studying ethics would help.\\" For his graduate studies, Ord moved to the University of Oxford, where he obtained a B.Phil., and a D.Phil. in philosophy. Having submitted his doctoral thesis, 'Beyond Action: applying consequentialism to decision making and motivation', Ord was retained as a junior research fellow by Balliol College, Oxford. Since 2014, Ord has been at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, where he holds the position of a Senior Research Fellow. Ord describes his focus as \\"the big picture questions facing humanity.\\" He is a trustee of the Centre for Effective Altruism and of 80,000 Hours. Research Ethics Ord's work has been primarily in moral philosophy. In applied ethics, he has worked on bioethics, the demands of morality, and global priority setting. He has also made contributions in global health, as an advisor to the 3rd edition of Disease Control Priorities Project. In normative ethics, his research has focused on consequentialism, and on moral uncertainty. Existential risk Ord's current main research interest is existential risk. His book on the topic ‚Äî The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity ‚Äî was published in March 2020.  Giving What We Can  At Oxford, Ord resolved to give a significant proportion of his income to the most cost-effective charities he could find. Following a number of enquiries from people interested in making a similar commitment, Ord decided to set up an organisation geared towards supporting like-minded donors. In 2009, Ord launched Giving What We Can, an international society whose members have each pledged to donate at least 10% of their income to the most cost-effective charities. The organisation is aligned with, and part, of the effective altruism movement. Giving What We Can seeks not only to encourage people to give more of their money to charity but also stresses the importance of giving to the most cost-effective ones, arguing that \\"research shows that some are up to 1,000 times as effective as others.\\" By February 2020 Giving What We Can had grown to over 4,500 members, who have pledged over $1.5 billion to charities. Ord himself decided initially to cap his income at ¬£20,000 per year, and to give away everything he earned above that to well- researched charities. A year later, he revised this figure down to ¬£18,000. This threshold rises annually with inflation. As of December 2019, he had donated ¬£106,000, or 28 percent of his income. Over the course of his career, he expects his donations to total around ¬£1 million.  Personal life  Ord lives in Oxford with his wife, Bernadette Young, a medical doctor. She is also a member of Giving What We Can.

It is endemic to the lowlands of the Mississippi River basin from Wisconsin and Minnesota south to Louisiana and East Texas. It is also found in the drainages of the Sabine and Neches Rivers of Texas and Louisiana. It can be found in slow-moving waters on riffles in rivers, as well as in creeks, swamps, lakes, and reservoirs. It mostly consumes the larvae of midges and blackflies. This species can reach a length of , though most only reach a length of .  Description  The mud darter has a terminal mouth with small teeth on its jaws. The back is olive or brown with 8-11 dark blotches, or saddles, across the back. The side has 9-12 dark brown irregular vertical bars and the base of the tail has three spots arranged vertically. The belly is typically a cream or light olive color. They can reach a length of , though most only reach a length of . The caudal fin is typically rounded or square in the mud darter. Its dorsal fin has two lobes, the first with 10-12 spines and the second with 10-14 rays. The mud darter does not have an adipose fin. The anal fin typically has 2 spines and 8-9 rays.  Diet  The mud darter mainly feeds on invertebrates. The typical diet consists of midge and blackfly larvae, but some small fish were seen to have micro-crustaceans in their diet as well.  Habitat  The mud darter is found in river mouths and overflow areas of large rivers. In these areas, it is typically found over mud covered with sand or other fine detritus. They can also be found over muddy bottoms in oxbow lakes or in slow riffles of streams. Large numbers of mud darters have been seen in the finely divided tree roots along the shores of large rivers. The juvenile fish are more often found in quieter areas than slow riffles.  Life Cycle  Mud darters do not live over three years of age. After hatching, the fish rapidly grow to half of the total length for year 1 in ten weeks. By the end of year one, most fish averaged between 3.3 cm and 4.4 cm and by the end of years two and three, most fish averaged between 4.3 cm and 5.5 cm. Survivorship from years 1-2 was 75% for males and 81% for females, but this drastically declines, with survivorship from years 2-3 dropping to 14.5% for males and 12.1% for females.  Reproduction  Spawning season for mud darters lasts from early March to early or mid May, with females reaching sexual maturity at one year. During spawning season, males do not establish territories, but are more aggressive toward other males. During courtship, the male swims around a female with his dorsal fin erect, sometimes resting his head on her nape. The spawning site is selected by the female, while the male follows behind. The female enters the vegetation vertically and the male then positions himself over the female, curving his body into an S-shape. The pair will vibrate for a couple of seconds. The females will release between 5 and 10 eggs, which fall onto the substrate or plant. The pair will repeat this process multiple times, resting for anywhere from a few minutes to one half- hour.  Distribution  The mud darter is distributed throughout the Mississippi River Basin lowlands in North America. It is found from Wisconsin and Minnesota to Louisiana and eastern Texas. It also found on the Gulf Slope in the Sabine River and Neches River drainages in Louisiana and Texas.  Etymology  The genus name Etheostoma comes from the Greek words etheo, meaning \\"strain\\" and stoma, meaning \\"mouth.\\" The species name asprigene means \\"rough cheek,\\" referring to the fully scaled cheek and opercle.

This species is found it the middle Cumberland River drainage in Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. It is absent in reaches above the Big South Fork, rare in North Carolina, and absent in western tributaries of the Tennessee River. While research on the ecology of E. atripinne is not extensive, what is known is they are usually found in small to medium freshwater streams in gravel riffle areas where their eggs can attach to the substrate and be left unguarded. E. atripinne can be found within a wide range of depths in its environment, leading its being classified as benthopelagic. While its global status is secure, the American Fisheries Society labels it with a status of ‚ÄúSpecial Concern‚Äù. Distribution As is the case with many other species of darters, the geographic distribution of E. atripinne is quite narrow and localized. The species is most often found in the middle Cumberland River drainage. While E. atripinne has been found in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, these are generally interpreted as the furthest reaches of the distribution given observations of low densities. It is not found above the Big South Fork River nor in the western tributaries of the Tennessee River, although E. s. atripinne was historically found in the Little South Fork of the Cumberland River.  Ecology  The Cumberland snubnose darter is found in flowing, rocky pools and adjacent riffles of small creeks with good water clarity and gravel bottoms or bottoms of bedrock strewn with rubble, and in small to medium rivers where confined to shallow gravel-bedded portions of riffles. This type of bottom is of utmost importance because their eggs attach to this substrate. Eggs do not attach well in areas that have been silted, and as a consequence, the species generally avoids these areas. They have been observed spawning in streams with water temperature ranging from 11 to 18 ¬∞C and prefer a relatively neutral to slightly alkaline pH. The natural predators of Cumberland snubnose darters are large piscivorous freshwater fish including, specifically, Micropterus dolomieu. Immature and adult food habits are consistent with invertivory. Examination of the stomach contents of 45 individuals segregated into four size classes showed midge larvae of the family Chironomidae make up the bulk of their diets. Depending on size, between 80% and 100% of the stomachs contained midge larvae. Mayfly nymphs, caddisfly larvae, copepods, and cladocerans were also well represented in the stomach contents. Competition with other species of darters is intense, as dietary overlap among species is relatively high, with selectivity occurring at the prey genus and species, but not family, levels. Consumption of food is highest in April, corresponding with the peak of spawning, while it is much lower during months of temperature extremes and decreased activity, such as January and July.  Life history  Etheostoma simoterum atripinne reaches sexual maturity in about one year and only survives for a breeding season (maximum life expectancy is about 18 months), which occurs in April to early May. Leading up to the breeding season, males develop bright colors, and by April, all males are deep green to blue-green in color with red-orange dorsal fins and red spots along their bodies. In fact, descriptions of species in the E. simoterum complex of snubnose darters, a group of six teleost freshwater fish species, are based largely on male nuptial coloration. Females do not appear to change in color during breeding. Males court females by erecting their fins and displaying their brilliant colors. A courtship is successful if the female leads the male to a sometimes preselected site, such as a large gravel bed, for egg deposition. Spawning is generally spread out over several spawning sites. After spawning, no parental care for the fertilized eggs is given, as they are left unguarded. However, current research indicates the evolution of a greater degree of parental care pertaining to males guarding the eggs in darters such as E. atripinne. Fully matured eggs are transparent, contain oil droplets for buoyancy, and are an average of 1.2 mm in diameter. The number of eggs a female lays ranges from 110 to 240. Taxonomy The Cumberland snubnose darter was first formally described as Arlina atripinnis in 1877 by the American ichthyologist David Starr Jordan with the type locality given as a tributary of the Cumberland River in the vicinity of Nashville, Tennessee.  Current management  E. atripinne is listed as ‚Äúsecure‚Äù in Tennessee, so not much effort has been put into the management of the species on a state or federal level. However, the Cumberland snubnose darter is very sensitive to siltification. In fact, this may be the single biggest problem as far as human-induced negative influences on the species. It is rare or absent in murky water or where stream gravel is covered by silt. Thus, it would be very sensitive to human activities such as stream channelization, sedimentation, and impoundment, which are known threats to species‚Äô viability. Statuses in other states include ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù and ‚Äúpossibly extirpated‚Äù in the case of North Carolina. The American Fisheries Society lists E. s. atripinne as resilient, but ultimately with a status of ‚ÄúSpecial Concern‚Äù. This is because species such as E. atripinne that specialize in benthic habitats in small to medium-sized rivers are more likely to be threatened by human activities.0Unfortunately, in the southern United States, the watersheds that support the greatest numbers of species are generally associated with privately owned land, meaning the majority of fish species in the southern states are not protected by federal ownership of the land.

It is found only in northern and eastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee. Description The emerald darter males are generally slightly larger and are more dramatically colored than females, with green accents on various parts of their bodies. Emerald darters can be found in rocky pools of small to medium creeks and rivers that maintain temperatures ranging from 0 to 25 ¬∞C.  Distribution  The emerald darter is restricted to the Cumberland Plateau, including only the upper Cumberland River drainages in eastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee. Rivers where emerald darters can be found include the Red River, Jacks Creek, Indian Creek in Kentucky, and Clear Creek, Elk Creek, Poor Creek, and other small water systems. Though populations have fluctuated through the years, the emerald darter's geographic range has stayed the same, and in some areas they can even be found in abundance. Populations may have experienced declines in the past due to strip-mining and siltation in the gravel substrates in which it spawns.  Ecology  Emerald darters compete heavily with other benthic freshwater fish in the southeastern United States. They are known as opportunistic feeders, relying on food and prey availability which fluctuates drastically throughout seasonal changes. Emerald darters are primarily insectivorous, and depending on size class, 80% to 100% of their diets can consist of small invertebrates. Emerald darters can be found in a variety of clear freshwater habitats with moderately low siltation. The fish can generally be found in water that ranges from 8 to 45 cm in depth, though they are known to retreat to deeper, rock-lined pools during colder months and when floods alter current velocity. Emerald darters inhabit waters that range from 0 to 25 ¬∞C, and can be found in riffles and runways up to 0.61 m/s flow velocity. As suggested by the emerald darter's subterminal mouth, they are benthic feeders, primarily consuming small invertebrates such as microcrustaceans, various types of larvae, and nematodes. Emerald darters tend to feed during the day, and their diets largely depend on the time of year, as prey availability changes due to season.They prefer streams with open sunlight and dense vegetation. No predators of emerald darters are known, and their cryptic coloration may help to conceal them in riffles with brightly colored rocks.  Life history  Emerald darters spawn in late April and early May. Though actual spawning has not been observed, attempts by males to mate include swimming from side to side over the female's back. Further, males have been observed in the wild trying to mount unresponsive females from behind or from the side. Emerald darter larvae usually measure 4.5 to 6.0 mm in length and emerge from the egg with yolk sacs still attached. Water temperature has a direct correlation with juvenile development, with warmer water temperatures resulting in a faster development and smaller sizes. Warmer temperatures can have even more detrimental effects on populations. Warmer temperatures in the later weeks of the breeding season can cause females to reabsorb their eggs and become unreceptive. Spawning occurs in the center of riffles. Larger males place themselves in pools near the middle of these turbulent areas so they will have a higher probability of encountering more females, which tend to use these areas. Emerald darters prefer gravel substrates that lack silt. Eggs and sperm are released simultaneously through mutual vibration and are attached by the female directly onto the gravel substrate. Emerald darters generally average 36 offspring per year. Most captured emerald darters have been aged at up to three years old. In the Red River drainage, 53% of the population survived its second year, while only 7.7% survived the third. Third-year individuals were predominantly male.  Current management  The emerald darter is not currently listed as a state or federal threatened species, though they are experiencing population declines in Tennessee. Though emerald darters have experienced population fragmentation, their range has not undergone declines. Threats to populations include limited range, as well as strip-mining, which results in heavy siltation of the gravel substrates on which they depend for reproduction. Damming of Tennessee's main waterways has fragmented the emerald darter's habitat. Kentucky's populations are not considered threatened. Management implications would include buffer areas around streams and wetlands to prevent deforestation. This would assist in the prevention of siltation in gravel substrates. More responsible coal practices or eliminating strip-mining altogether will have obvious effects on streams known to contain populations of emerald darters. Strategies such as these are imperative to the conservation of E. baileyi because even localized destruction of its habitat could have devastating effects on its populations. Unfortunately, emerald darters‚Äô benthic feeding habits make this species significantly more susceptible to alterations in habitat. Taxonomy and etymology The emerald darter was first formally described in 1982 by Lawrence M. Page and Brooks Burr with the type locality being given as the Little Sexton Creek which is a tributary of the South Fork Kentucky River in Clay County, Kentucky. The speciic name honours the American ichthyologist Reeve Maclaren Bailey (1911‚Äì2011) who was Curator Emeritus of Fishes and Professor Emeritus of Zoology, University of Michigan, Museum of Zoology, Ann Arbor, Michigan in recognition of his contribution to systematic ichthyology. The emerald darter has been classified in the subgenus Ulocentra, the snubnose darters and shares many similarities with other species in the group, such as eight or nine dorsal saddles, a blunt nose, scales on the belly, and other distinguishing characteristics. Emerald darters are moderate-sized darters, ranging from 2.9 to 5.0 cm. name = Gumm> However, molecular phylogenies have not recovered much evidence of paraphyly within the genus Etheostoma and thus the evidence supporting the use of subgenera for taxonomy in this genus is not strong.

It is endemic to the eastern United States only known from Caney Fork, Tennessee, where it has been shown to have as many as five subgroups. They are active hunters which prey on insects, fry, and possibly young snails. Multiple species and subspecies of these darters can coexist where substrate is varied, so this must be carefully preserved to accommodate many similar species.. With the warming of spring, E. basilare enters its breeding cycle and males develop their dimorphic coloration. Like most darters, it hugs the stream bed, using its body shape and fin posture to maintain its position. This lifestyle which is so dependent upon the benthic architecture of the stream is highly impacted by disturbance, which can be the result of increased or decreased flow from dams, introduction of polluted debris, or particulate size change due to erosion. Dams, in particular, pose a large threat to this species due to the effects of siltation, which can over time fill in streambed substrate gaps, destroying nesting sites and suffocating any eggs already laid. In addition, different species and subspecies of darter are highly adapted to a given substrate size, which insinuates that this habitat homogenization could result in a negative impact on the existent E. basilare subspecies diversity and on the darter ecological balance as a whole. Distribution The corrugated darter is endemic to the upper section of the Caney Fork and Collins River in eastern Tennessee, both of which are part of the Cumberland River drainage. It has been consistently present in this area since its original speciation, upon which its geographic home has had considerable influence. Formed by the abundance of melt from the receding North American glaciers, which presumably carried the darter ancestor with it, this part of the river system has been mostly isolated from neighboring water systems by this drastic geographic change, creating a likely environment for the genetic deviation of many darter species, E. basilare included. This effect can also be observed at a smaller scale. Conditions in this part of the river have enabled the corrugated darter to further diverge into five closely related subgroups, highlighting the adaptability of the species and how even small habitat differences can drive divergence. Ecology No study has yet been made of the corrugated darter's feeding habits, but many of its relatives are active predators, hunting insects and fry while situationally consuming detritus. The closely related E. barbouri, or teardrop darter, is known to eat fly and mayfly larva, augmenting this diet with decaying leaves and other decomposing biomatter in the water. It is likely preyed upon by local bass, trout, sculpin, reptiles, and salamanders as adults, as well as by carnivorous aquatic insects as fry. This species competes most strongly on an interspecific level, as can be seen in the resulting five subspecies. In similar species, the greatest factor in the balance of these cohabitating darters is the size of the substrate in the river bed. Being a benthic species, this creates a number of microhabitats which allow these subspecies to coexist with its own preferred territory. Darters inhabit most water depths up to a meter as adults, depending on substrate size, but greatly prefer the protection of shallow riffles as fry. As adults, they also enter these areas to breed. Life history In related darters, sexual maturity is often reached at a year old. The breeding season is estimated to be from April to May annually, but depends greatly on water temperature, which causes the sexual reaction to take place. Males and females of many darter species do exhibit obvious sexual dimorphism, with bright mating displays present in the males, but no such information indicates the presence or lack of these colors for E. basilare. Most darters have shown a preference for moderately shallow riffles during the breeding season, where the running water may aid oxygen dispersion to the eggs and provide a safer nursery for the fry. They nest under flat rocks, where the males aggressively guard their clutch of eggs laid by multiple females, whose average egg deposition varies widely between species; this figure for E. basilare is not known. The corrugated darter may participate in egg-mimicking behavior, using the spots on their pectoral fins to entice prospective mates, which prefer experienced males already guarding eggs, into depositing in their nest. They have been recorded as reaching 5.5 cm in length; the average lifespan of this species is not documented. Management The corrugated darter is rated as ‚ÄúLeast Concern‚Äù by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. As of yet, this species has seen little habitat disruption, having no major damming or construction projects in the area. The nearest dam, Dale Hollow, is located further down the Caney Fork's flow. The greatest risk this structure presents to the species is found in the lake behind it, which has been stocked with potential predators - walleye and several species of crappie and bass. The threat of extinction due to this is minimal, however, as the previously mentioned fish are all popular sport fish, subject to frequent reduction by human predation. In addition, this fish exhibits high fecundity, doubling its population in as few as 15 months, making it particularly resistant to predation, though possibly more vulnerable when breeding sites are disturbed and it is unable to adequately recoup its population loss. In many species of darter, hybridization is a major concern, since they are closely related and use external fertilization. In E. basilare, however, this is probably not the case. The existence of their many subspecies may indicate the detrimental effects of hybridization are minimal, either due to some form of sperm exclusion or perhaps resulting from the localization of the subspecies in relation to their optimal habitats.

It is endemic to the Barren River system in south-central Kentucky and north-central Tennessee. This species is usually found in small rocky pools on the sides of creeks and rivers. The splendid darter, like many other darter species, inhabits a single small river system and exhibits specialized reproductive behaviors that are only supported by a particular type of environment. This river system is vulnerable to even the slightest changes, whether natural or anthropogenic, putting inhabitants of the system at risk. The two most influential landscape features affecting the current distribution of E. barrenense are land use/land cover patterns and soil composition. As such, these two phenomena must be closely monitored in the following years to ensure the safety of the splendid darter and all other species found in the Barren River system. The current existence and continuing development of dams in Tennessee is one of the most pressing issues affecting freshwater environments and preventing many species of fish from migrating properly. Distribution The splendid darter is found only in the Barren River system of southern central Kentucky and northern central Tennessee; this system is a part of the Ohio River drainage. The range of this species is between 5000 ‚Äì 20,000 square kilometers, which is relatively small. E. barrenense is not thought to have either spread or shrunk its distribution since it was described in 1982, but very little data are available on its dispersal and other movements; some larvae may drift along with the current, but ultimately, the species has remained in its small range. The splendid darter has a tendency to spend most of its life in deep, rocky pools and the riffles of small creeks and rivers, as well as streams. The geographic distribution of E. barrenense and other darter species is extremely important to the way the species passes on its genes to subsequent generations. Much of the isolation that remains between closely related species of darters is due to brilliant nuptial coloring and behavioral isolation, ensuring that mates of the same species are attracted to one another. Since many of these species live in sympatric populations, there must be a mechanism such as this, allowing the genes of different species to remain isolated. Without the occurrence of this phenomenon, the very genes which define the species could be compromised, endangering its existence. Ecology The splendid darter is a benthopelagic fish that occupies a freshwater habitat . Research has not yet revealed the specific dieting habits, competitors, or predators of this darter, but studies of other darter species indicate the splendid darter is likely insectivorous and at times consumed by larger predatory fish. These invertivorous fish spend most of their time feeding on the bottoms and sides of streams. Life history E. barrenense reaches sexual maturity around one year of age, but the majority of breeding individuals sampled are between two and three years old. Typical mating pairs include a two-year-old female and a three-year-old male. Breeding occurs once a year, normally from March to June in Kentucky and March to May in Tennessee. The average lifespan of this species is only three years, so most individuals may breed once or twice before they die. No individuals have been known to live beyond three years. Most species of Etheostoma exhibit unique nuptial coloration and E. barrenense is no exception. It Reproductive isolation and sexual selection between species is thought to maintain these diverse color patterns, as these fish are often found in sympatric populations. Breeding is an interesting phenomenon; males establish floating territories in deep pools and females approach these microhabitats where both fish will press against inclined stones to lay their eggs. Many eggs are laid at one time, but they are usually produced individually on separate, vertical rocks in slightly flowing currents. This dispersing of the eggs increases the chance of survival for at least a few of the offspring. The eggs are spherical, translucent, and adhesive, providing them a greater opportunity to survive as they are attached to a vertical wall and often difficult to detect. Management On a conservation level, Etheostoma barrenense is considered secure using the NatureServe conservation status both nationally and globally, but vulnerable on a state scale in Tennessee. However, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has not evaluated the conservation status of this species, so some debate exists surrounding just how threatened it may be. We have just cause to assume that for now, the species is stable. However, increasing anthropogenic change in the area may be leading to the future detriment of not only the splendid darter, but other wildlife inhabiting this small ecosystem in the southeastern United States. E. barrenense is considered a species that warrants protection in Tennessee, but not throughout its range. Geographic extent, habitat specificity (the number of habitat types in which a species is known to exist), and local population size are good criteria to use as a basis for species rarity, and according to these three dimensions, the splendid darter is extremely rare. This characteristic alone is enough to warrant protection of the species, yet no management practices are in place specific to the conservation of the splendid darter. In addition to its rarity, several other factors have the potential to contribute to a decline in splendid darter abundance. These include, but are not limited to, hybridization with closely related species, habitat destruction or modification, and the threat of invasive species. An estimated 10,000 individuals of E. barrenense exist across its native range in Kentucky and Tennessee.

Cushing.Hampden‚ÄìSydney Buildings , H-SC Then & Now After almost a decade after being founded at the University of Virginia, Pi Kappa Alpha was \\"re-founded\\" as part of the Hampden‚ÄìSydney Convention, held in a student room of Cushing Hall in the late 1870s. The four delegates to the Hampden‚ÄìSydney Convention are referred to as the Junior Founders. It was at this convention that the fraternity defined itself as belonging to \\"the South.\\" At the New Orleans Convention in 1909, Pi Kappa Alpha officially decided to declare itself a national organization. The exterior has been restored and the interior modernized (first in 1910, more recently in 1998). Porches were added in 1910, along with a slate roof, replacing the original cedar shakes. The front of the building was originally the back, which faced the 18th century campus (which it also replaced).

It is found in Barren River and Green River systems in Tennessee and Kentucky. This moderate-sized fish usually matures between one and two years of age. The territorial males spawn over the top of buried females in the gravels of fast- flowing riffle areas. This usually occurs from late April to late June. Both the juveniles and adults are vicious predators, and mainly like to feed on dipteran larvae. Distribution These darters are known only from the Green and Barren River watersheds. The Green River is the largest river of the two, and the Barren River is a tributary to the Green River, which is known for a \\"biodiversity hotspot.\\" This river's hotspot is considered to be between the 100-mile stretch from Green River reservoir dam and Mammoth Cave National Park. More than 150 fish species and 70 mussels have been found in this system, and many other aquatic species. This river drains to the Mississippi, but the orangefin darters do not go that far down the system. Green River is a flowing system with many waterfalls, and mountain springs flowing into it to give a clean green look because of the depth. The Barren River headwaters are more in Tennessee, but flows in Kentucky, also. The Barren River is north of the Nashville Basin, in Clay, Macon, and Sumner Counties, draining the northward-sloping portion of the Highland Rim. It meets the Green River around Warren County, Kentucky. \\"A typical Highland Rim stream is cool, clear water, gravel substrates, and riffle pool habitats.\\" Ecology The upper Green River system was studied, and six endemic darter species were analyzed. Over 300 sites were examined during a 13-year period with five classes in the landscape map: agriculture, forest, water, and developed/exposed. \\"Orangefin darter was detected at 46% of the sample sites and occupies portions of all major river systems in the watershed.\\" This darter occurred more often than the other five darter species, but it was mostly around forest-covered areas or below large reservoirs. It also was found around fine-loamy soils that had good water velocity, and averaging low 50-degrees temperatures. This species needs the right living environment to feed and spawn, but in these living areas are predators, and competition occurs. Larger freshwater fish prey on darters, such as catfish and smallmouth bass. Intraspecific competition occurs because small invertebrates are more abundant during different times of the year, and breeding areas become a challenge, also. Darters tend to feed on small fish larvae, which adds more competition within the species. Interspecific competition can be caused by abundance of predators, or human impacts on the environment. Increasing agriculture and deforestation, or sending more pollution down the stream, can reduce the abundance of this species. The building of dams can slow the flow of water, which will have a major effect on the orangefin because they use rocky substrates and swift- moving riffles for hiding and feeding. Their ecosystem must stay balanced in the future, or stress on these endemic species can cause extinction sooner. Life history N. bellus is a moderate-sized darter of the subgenus Nothonotus, endemic to the Green and Barren River system in south-central Kentucky and north-central Tennessee. \\"Spawning was from late April to late June in gravel substrates of fast flowing riffles.\\" Darters mostly inhabit somewhat deeper water until the spawning period begins, and they become more aggressive with the warmer waters. During this period, they move to better- flowing waters with riffles and rocks. When breeding starts, the territorial males, or larger mature males attract the females to come spawn. Coloration in the males is a big part also in breeding, and the \\"females prefer conspecific over heterospecific coloration, and prefer a particular color variant within species.\\" When the female picks the right male, she buries herself in the substrate on his territory. The male lies parallel with her where he ejects his sperm into the substrate, so it can meet with the eggs she has laid. They lay clusters of eggs, around 60-100, but only so many will hatch within 7‚Äì9 days in 23 ¬∞C water. The male guards the nest for a few days, but finally leaves, and the eggs that hatch are on their own. Maturity is reached in a year to two, and males seem to mature sooner, and their lifespan is about five years. Their diet is mostly hydracarinads, ephemeropteran nymphs, and dipteran larvae, but it changes some depending on the time of year. They also reached their feeding peak during the afternoon, and juveniles and adults mostly fed on the same food types. Usually, the juveniles stay in the shallow waters for a while, and the adults went back to deeper waters after breeding. Taxonomy The orangefin darter was first formally described in 1968 by Timothy Zorach with the type locality given as White Oak Creek, at a bridge between White Oak and Galen, 1.2 miles northwest of Galen in Macon County, Tennessee. Zorach initially placed it in the subgenus Nothonotus but Fishbase classifies it within the genus Etheostoma while recognising 4 species within a valid genus Nothonotus. Management Though the orangefin darter has a small range, it is listed by the IUCN as least concern \\"in view of the large number of subpopulations, large population size, apparently stable trend, and lack of major threats\\". The Nature Conservancy operates a conservation project in the Green River, which is inhabited by the orangefin darter.

Its county town was Elbasan in Albania.  Administration  Although Halil Inalcik explains that the Sanjak of Elbasan was established as soon as the fortress of Elbasan has been constructed, based on Tursun Beg's records there is a possibility that Elbasan initially was part of the Sanjak of Ohrid. The Sanjak of Elbasan had three kazas: *Elbasan, *Gramsh and *Peqin. It became part of the Manastir Vilayet when it was established in the 19th century.Ottoman Provinces before 1908 Marino Bizzi, the Archbishop of Bar (Antivari), stated in his report that on May 17, 1591 that name of the sanjakbey of Sanjak of Elbasan was Mehmet Bey. During the reign of K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Mustafa Pasha (1637 ‚Äì August 19, 1691) one of the sanjakbeys of Elbasan was Hasan Pasha. In 1714 the sanjabey of the Sanjak of Elbasan was Zejnil-beg. At the beginning of 20th century sanjakbey of Elbasan was Necib Efendi, who was transferred to another position in February 1904. History  Disestablishment  Territorial expansion of the Kingdom of Serbia in 1913. During the First Balkan War at the end of 1912 the Sanjak of Elbasan together with most of the territory of Albania was occupied and de facto annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia. The Sanjak of Elbasan was on 29 November included in the Serbian administrative system as a srez () within Draƒç County (), one of four srezes (the other being Draƒç, Lje≈°, Tirana). In 1914 Elbasan became a part of the newly established Principality of Albania, established on the basis of peace contract signed during the London Conference of 1912‚Äì13.  Demographics  15th century In 1467 many Christians from Skopje, Ohrid, Serres and Kastoria were forcibly deported to Elbasan. 16th century At the beginning of the 16th century the Sanjak of Elbasan had the highest population density of all Ottoman sanjaks in the Balkans, with . Between 1520 and 1535 up to 94,5% population of the Sanjak of Elbasan were Christians. 17th century An Ottoman traveller Evliya √áelebi recorded in 1670 that Elbasan had 18 quarters with Muslim population and 10 quarters populated by an Orthodox and Roman Catholic population. He also stated that Serbs, Bulgarians and Voyniks (Ottoman Christian mercenaries) were not allowed to take up residence in Elbasan, otherwise they would be immediately slain according to ancient custom. The Albanian language was spoken by all residents, most of whom also had an advanced knowledge of Turkish. The merchants could also speak Greek and Italian. 19th century According to Russian consul in the Manastir Vilayet, A. Rostkovski, finishing the statistical article in 1897, the total population of the sanjak was 56,105. Albanian Muslims were 51,786, Albanian Christians were 3,319, and Vlachs (Aromanians) were 1,000. 20th century At the beginning of the 20th century it was estimated that 15,000 people lived in Elbasan, which was then the seat of a Greek bishop. In the region between Elbasan and Berat there were numerous villages which population publicly declared themselves as Muslims, but privately practised Christianity. Albanians who lived in Elbasan were Tosks and because of that the Sanjak of Elbasan was seen as part of Toskalik, land of Tosks, together with the sanjaks of Ergiri, Preveze, Berat, Yanya, Gorice and Manastir. Tosks did not have a tribal society like Ghegs had.

Built on the hill of the same name, the defensive system of the city consisted of the fortresses of O Castro and San Sebasti√°n and the now disappeared city wall. The city wall had an irregular shape due to the orography of the city, it was constructed by the Engineer Colonel Fernando de Gourannanbergue and maestre de campo Diego Arias Taboada to link the two fortresses. Despite this effort to provide security to the city, documents from that time say that this defensive system was ineffective as it could not impede landings further along the coast. After several attempts to improve the defenses of the city, Vigo was looted again by British navy on the 23-24 October 1702 during Battle of Vigo Bay at the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1809, the fortress was occupied by the French army during Peninsular War; on 28 March that year the fortress was reconquered following an uprising by people of Vigo, because of the city was given the honorific title of \\"the faithful, loyal and courageous city of Vigo\\" the following year.

It was released the same year as Spede's N√§k√∂radiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut and Pohjan t√§hteet. Though the film is principally in black and white, the last 20 minutes are filmed in colour. Kari Sohlberg won the 1970 Jussi Award nomination for Best Cinematography jointly for the film along with J√∂rn Donner's Sixtynine 69 and Pohjan t√§hteet. Plot Jim King (Spede Pasanen) is the rich owner of a toy company and a constant pain for his closest competitor Krakstr√∂m (Juhani Kumpulainen) from whom he keeps snatching important toy contracts. As a result, Krakstr√∂m's company is nearing bankruptcy, which causes friction when King starts dating Krakstr√∂m's daughter Sylvi (Tamara Lund). However, King's company can't make a profit since the taxes they must pay increase exponentially as the company becomes bigger. As a way of keeping his company in business, King tries to get his company a tax break by hiring the country's best gangster, Nitti (Risto Aaltonen), to break into his safe which isn't ensured. However, his dutiful Treasurer (Vesa-Matti Loiri) has the safe ensured just as the crime is to be committed, thus undoing his scheme. When the theft is reported in the papers, Krakstr√∂m gets the idea of collecting the insurance of a painting in his office, and by sheer coincidence hires the same gangster to commit the crime. However, the painting ends up returned to Krakstr√∂m against his will by the well-meaning Jim. Krakstr√∂m also attempts to fake his own daughter's kidnapping to get his hands on King's money, but King gets it back by copying the scheme. While this is going on, King's Treasurer suddenly comes into possession of a large amount of excess money even though all of the company's cash has been deposited in the bank. Not realising that he has actually turned in the cash-boxes which contain his sandwich-making materials, the Treasurer begins to spend the money on driving lessons, a new car, hygiene products and in putting an ad in the paper to find himself a woman. In a final desperate effort, Krakstr√∂m hires Nitti to rob a bank and involuntarily involves King, who is trying to help Sylvi who has discovered that the bank is missing 500,000 marks. The money is obviously that found by King's Treasurer. While King attempts to return the money to the bank, Nitti then decides to do as Krakstr√∂m originally instructed and rob the bank clean. King manages to defuse the situation with some laughing gas and when the police take Nitti, Krakstr√∂m, King and his associates to the station, Nitti's bag is revealed only to contain the cash-boxes with the Treasurer's sandwich equipment. In the end, Jim and Sylvi get married and in a show of good-will, King writes Krakstr√∂m a check to save his company. Cast * Spede Pasanen ‚Äì Jim King, the toy-company millionaire. * Vesa-Matti Loiri ‚Äì Treasurer, King's treasurer who accidentally deposits the cash-boxes containing his sandwich making materials, instead of the company's 500'000 marks. * Simo Salminen ‚Äì Designer Sulo Rantavaara, the mastermind behind King's successful toys. * Juhani Kumpulainen ‚Äì Krakstr√∂m, King's rival in the toy industry. * Tamara Lund ‚Äì Sylvi Krakstr√∂m, Krakstr√∂m's daughter who works as a bank-teller and takes a liking to King. * Jukka Sipil√§ ‚Äì Krakstr√∂m's servant; referred to by many names by Krakstr√∂m, he performs the duties of a secretary, a driver and a general underling doing his dirty work. Due to Krakstr√∂m's financial difficulties, he is the last person working at his company. * Risto Aaltonen ‚Äì Nitti, a gangster hired by both King and Krakstr√∂m at various points in the film. * Pirkko Mannola ‚Äì Nitti's girlfriend, who catches King and Rantavaara when they break into Krakstr√∂m's office for the second time to return the paintings stolen by Nitti and forces them to help with the bank robbery. * Leo Jokela ‚Äì Detective Sirpaleaho, the detective who is called to investigate the crimes committed by Nitti. Ere Kokkonen appears in an uncredited cameo as an American toy investor at the beginning of the film. Black and white to colour switch The film features a rarely seen switch from black and white into colour. The gangster Nitti, upon waking up on the morning of the bank robbery, doesn't get his usual morning drink. As he sobers up, the film turns to colour and remains so for much of the finale, except for a brief moment in Jim and Sylvi's wedding when Nitti starts drinking again. The switch technically makes Leikkikalugangsteri Pasanen's first colour feature. Pohjant√§hteet, released the same year, was the first feature by Spede and Ere Kokkonen to be filmed fully in colour.

Wienerlieder) or Weanaliad (viennese, pl. Weanaliada) is a song genre which has its roots in Vienna, the capital of Austria. Traditional Viennese songs, known as Wienerlieder are centred on the theme of life in Vienna and are almost exclusively sung in Viennese (a local Austro-Bavarian dialect). The Wienerlied is a unique musical and socio-cultural phenomenon, a psychograph of the Viennese way of life; a mix between idealism, joie de vivre and desperation.Wiener Volksliederwerk, Zum Wienerlied There are approximately 60,000 ‚Äì 70,000 Wienerlieder, of which only a few hundred are still sung today.  Characteristics  A distinguishing feature of many Wienerlieder is their chromatic and harmonic variety. Frequent changes in tempo together with theatrical pauses throughout the songs bring a certain degree of excitement to both singer and listener. A typical Wienerlied is written according to a 2/4 or 3/4 time signature with an often-alternated rhythm. The Wienerlied has a more complicated musical structure than other well-known music genres such as blues, rock, folk or Alpine folk music. It is therefore quite unusual that Wienerlieder became so popular, yet it is often the case that many songs become established as traditional folk songs in Vienna. The Alpine-Bavarian roots of Wienerlieder are still recognizable; for example, the melody of ‚ÄòL√§ndler‚Äô (an Austrian folk dance featuring much hopping and stamping) or the characteristic use of melodic polyphony (a deep main voice sung together with a second accompanying higher-pitched voice). Slavo-Hungarian components are also recognizable within Wienerlieder, adding to the unique mix of multiple musical elements that give an exciting and surprising feel to Viennese folk songs. And all of this with a carefree wink and that typical Viennese ‚Äòschm√§h‚Äô (Viennese: ‚ÄúWeana Schm√§h‚Äù; German: ‚ÄúWiener Schm√§h‚Äù) as characteristic as the folk songs themselves; a blend of humour built on quick-wit and charm and at times sarcasm and melancholy, but always expressed with a smile.  Roots  The characteristics of Wienerlieder can be defined through a variety of roots: * Street-song, hurdy-gurdy man * Theatre couplets * Art song, lied * Songs of ‚ÄúVolksaenger‚Äù (popular entertainers of Viennese folk culture) * Folk songs (Bavarian, Slavic, Hungarian) * Operetta and Vaudeville  History  The Wienerlied reached its heyday in the 19th century, which is closely related to the rise of popular entertainment during the last quarter of the 19th century (inns and restaurants in the Prater gardens, nightclubs, Singspiel halls, \\"Heuriger\\" wine taverns, etc.). The development of Volkssaenger (popular entertainers of viennese folk culture) promoted the Wienerlied and several songs gained great popularity.Wiener Lied (austria-lexikon.at)  References   Sources  *Most of the material in this article is from the Bavarian Wikipedia article Weanaliad.

History In 1874, British Columbia threatened to withdraw from Confederation. Queen Victoria was petitioned by Premier Walkem for relief from failure to delivery the promise of a railroad to Victoria. Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie and Walkem agreed to accept arbitration of the dispute by the Earl of Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary. Both parties promised to be bound by the ruling. The judgment was given on 17 November 1874. A report of the Privy Council accepting the new terms was approved by the Governor General on December 18, 1874. Nevertheless, the federal government bill approving the settlement agreement failed in the Senate of Canada, and British Columbia secession was raised again. Decision Earl of Carnarvon terms: 1\\\\. \\"That the railway from Esquimalt to Nanaimo shall be commenced as soon as possible, and completed with all practicable despatch.\\" 2\\\\. \\"That the surveys on the Mainland shall be pushed on with the utmost vigor. On this point, after considering the representations of your, ministers, I feel that I have no alternative but to reply, as I do most fully and readily, upon their assurance that no legitimate effort or expense will be spared, first, to determine the best route for the line, and secondly, to proceed with the details of the engineering work. It would be distasteful to me, if, indeed, it were not impossible, to prescribe strictly any minimum of time or expenditure with regard to work of so uncertain a nature; but, happily, it is equally impossible for me to doubt that your Government will loyally do its best in every way to accelerate the completion of a duty left freely to its sense of honor and justice.\\" 3\\\\. \\"That the wagon road and telegraph line shall be immediately constructed. There seems here to be some difference of opinion as to the special value to the Province of the undertaking to complete these two works, but after considering what has been said, I am of opinion that they should both be proceeded with at once, as indeed is suggested by your ministers.\\" 4\\\\. \\"That $2,000,000 a year, and not $1,500,000, shall be the minimum expenditure on railway works within the Province from the date at which the surveys are sufficiently completed to enable that amount to be expended on construction. In naming this amount I understand that it being alike the interest and the wish of the Dominion Government to urge on with all speed the completion of the works now to be undertaken, the annual expenditure will be as much in excess of the minimum, of $2,000,000 as in any year may be found practicable.\\" 5\\\\. \\"Lastly, that on or before December 31st, 1898, the railway shall be completed and open for traffic from the Pacific seaboard to a point at the western end of Lake Superior, at which it will fall into connection with the existing lines of railway through a portion of the United States, and also with the navigation of Canadian waters. To proceed at present with the remainder of the railway extending, by the country northward of Lake Superior, to the existing Canadian lines, ought not, in my opinion, to be required, and the time for undertaking that work must be determined by the development of settlement and the changing circumstances of the country.

He was born on St. Patrick's Day in Toronto, Ontario. By the time of his sudden death in 1965, he had built Empire Laboratories into the largest pharmaceutical business in Canada. Winter Laboratories Louis Winter was the youngest of six children. He attended Jarvis Collegiate Institute in Toronto where he made the honour roll. He was accepted into the biochemistry program at the University of Toronto, and graduated with a master's degree in the subject. In 1948 he borrowed $10,000 from his father Abraham, and opened his first venture, Winter Laboratories. The business was based in the family's garage processing blood work and pregnancy tests for local pharmacies, doctors' offices and medical clinics. With just his school mate, Toby Johansen, to handle initial sales, the company quickly outgrew its space and moved into a house near the University of Toronto's main campus. The business continued to expand; Winter Laboratories leased the basement of the Mothercraft Building on Bloor Street, where Rochdale College was built in 1968. Louis Winter recognized that brand name pharmaceutical drugs and popular over-the-counter medications were expensive, and that many consumers were having a difficult time purchasing their required prescriptions. He knew that many of these products could be synthesized or purchased in bulk and then manufactured or packaged into their required dosage forms for a fraction of their retail cost. He investigated this prospect further with the Canadian government authorities, and he discovered from Industry Canada, their Patent Office, and the government's Health Protection Branch, that he could establish a pharmaceutical manufacturing business providing that he adhered to their strict plant conditions and production standards. Before officially starting his own generic pharmaceutical company, on July 20, 1955, Louis Winter incorporated Anchor Serum Company of Canada Limited, after negotiating the exclusive Canadian rights to manufacture the product line of Anchor Serum Company of St. Louis, MO. Anchor Serum primarily specialized in supplying pharmaceuticals to veterinarians. As his manufacturing business expanded, Winter then purchased a four-story industrial building at 77 Florence Street, the former candy manufacturing facility of Jenny Lynn Chocolates, and on August 21, 1959, he incorporated Empire Laboratories Limited. Empire Laboratories Empire Laboratories became the first Canadian pharmaceutical company that was permitted to keep its pill and product packaging exactly like its brand name counterparts, to prevent consumers from becoming confused when purchasing its lower cost generic medication alternatives, providing that Empire placed its recognizable \\"E\\" trademark identity directly on all of its products (Parke, Davis & Co. v. Empire Laboratories Ltd., [1964] S.C.R. 351). This landmark Supreme Court case was instrumental in the development of Canada's generic drug industry. Louis Winter soon had to expand his operations and purchased a larger five-story building from the Reichmann family, the former Planter's Peanut factory at 301 Lansdowne Avenue, just two blocks from Empire's current base on Florence Street, and he added additional production, including a synthesis laboratory on the top floor for the manufacturing of saccharine, the low-calorie sweetener. Winter also purchased a printing facility which he renamed Professional Printing Services Limited from the Mount family in 1963 that was originally located at 1389 Weston Road, Toronto, and Walter and Peter Mount became Empire employees. Empire Laboratories could then provide all its independent pharmacies from coast to coast with customized prescription delivery bags, point-of-purchase displays, posters, and signage as a loyalty incentive, in an era prior to the dominance of national chain drug stores. Empire also provided medical practitioners with complimentary stationery and prescription pads. To offset these marketing costs, Empire's printing division also retained dedicated print brokers and a couple of sales representatives to ensure that the division did not operate at a loss, and it processed all of the company's product labels and plant packaging. The Empire pharmaceutical operation became diversified and expanded, and it became one of Canada's largest pharmaceutical companies with over 100 products in its 1964 product catalog. Empire was the first Canadian firm to license and manufacture popular medications like Valium (diazepam), Orinase (tolbutamide) and Tetracyn (tetracycline). The United States market was becoming a greater focus, and the U.S. military became a client, and a special manufacturing facility was being built in Puerto Rico under PRIDCO (Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company) to ship products tariff free to the US Mainland. Lou Winter also invested in Vanguard Medical Supplies, the first Canadian mail-order based pharmaceutical business with Israel Kerzner and Murray Rubin, to service rural regions via catalog mail order, and Professional Printing Services handled all of the catalog production. Death At age 41, Louis Winter died on November 5, 1965, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Toronto, just 17 days prior to his wife Beverley's death. Beverly had previously been hospitalized at the same facility having been diagnosed with terminal leukemia. The couple left four children under the age of seven: Paul born on December 16, 1958; Jeffrey born on May 23, 1960; Kerry born June 3, 1961; and Dana born on June 21, 1962. Sale of Empire Laboratories Bernard (Barry) Sherman, who had lost his father on November 17, 1952, at age nine, had worked for his Uncle Lou at Empire Laboratories during his final high-school years and throughout his first three years of college while attending the University of Toronto. Upon the completion of his PhD in astrophysics at M.I.T. in 1967, Barry Sherman with his high-school friend, Joel Ulster, purchased the Empire Group of Companies on August 23, 1967. The Executor, Royal Trust, now a division of Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), processed this transaction on behalf of the infant beneficiaries of Beverley and Louis Winter. Barry Sherman would eventually launch Apotex Inc. in 1974. To facilitate the corporate acquisition, Barry and Joel Ulster (Sherman and Ulster Limited) offered five-percent equity options to each of the four children and a fifteen-year royalty on four of its patented products (Globe and Mail, November 24, 2007). Litigation was before the courts concerning the purchase of the corporate assets and brands from the Winter children's estate, as Sherman and his partner never paid the royalties nor provided the promised equity in the businesses. In September 2017, an Ontario Superior Court justice ruled against the cousins saying the case was \\"wishful thinking, and beyond fanciful.\\" At the time of the judgement, a lawyer for the cousins said they would appeal, though no appeal occurred, and Sherman died a few months later under unknown circumstances.

Career Moore joined the police force in 1955, following a period of National Service in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He was a member of the Criminal Investigation Department of the City of London Police, but also served in the City Fraud Squad and Regional Crime Squads, and was promoted through the ranks. As Commander, he oversaw the investigation into the death of Roberto Calvi, dubbed \\"God's Banker\\", in June 1982. In July that year, Moore gave evidence in the trial of two City of London Police officers, held as part of Operation Countryman, in which he denied corruption allegations made by one of the defendants. The allegations had been made on a secret tape recording, though the defendant had subsequently withdrawn them on the grounds that he had been drunk at the time they were made. Moore was also involved with the police investigations into the collapses of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the Maxwell empire. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the 1992 New Year's Honours. He oversaw the establishment of the ring of steel surrounding the City of London in 1993. Over his career, he received eleven commendations from commissioners and judges for his work.

He established his practice in 1878, and for 10 years worked in partnership with William de Morgan (1839‚Äì1917), for whom he designed tiles, vases, and other artefacts. He advocated the use of glazed materials to resist the polluted atmosphere of nineteenth century London. In this, he anticipated the designs of Otto Wagner in Vienna, who used coloured tiles set in the same planes as walls and piers to suggest architectural features. He designed several buildings, of which the best were the Howrah Station, gateway to Calcutta, situated in the twin city Howrah, district Howrah, West Bengal, India (1901; with a glowing exterior of brick and coloured tiles), and Debenham House in Holland Park (1905‚Äì8), completely faced with impervious glazed materials, even the roof-tiles. He was an Arts-and-Crafts architect, whose work was extraordinarily sensitive, imaginative, and original. Among his works his own house, ‚ÄòWoodside‚Äô, Graffham, near Petworth, Sussex (1905), deserves note.

He was the founder of the Barry or De Barry family in County Cork, and common ancestor of the barons Barry and earls of Barrymore. Philip was born circa 1137/44 and was described by his (not totally impartial) brother Gerald as a wise and honourable man (vir probus ac prudens).Expugnatio Hibernica by Giraldus Cambrensis; Book 2, Chapter 20, v94 He died while his brother Gerald was at Rome in 1199-1200 and was entombed in the church of Manorbier.Burke's Irish Family Records, 1976 Ancestry Nesta Philip's role in the invasion and colonisation of Ireland, and his position in the medieval Welsh-Irish Norman society, was largely due to his membership of the extended family of descendants of Princess Nest or Nesta of Deheubarth.Expugnatio Hibernica by Giraldus Cambrensis; A B Scott & F X Martin, editors; Dublin 1978 edition; historical introduction page xxi Nest had three sons and a daughter by her first husband Gerald de Windsor: the daughter, Angharad, married William de Barry. William de Barry Philip was the son of William Fitz Odo de Barry was the son of Odo or Otho, a Norman knight who assisted in the Norman Conquest of England and Wales during the 11th century. William rebuilt Manorbier Castle in stone and the family retained the lordship of Manorbier until the 15th century. Philip's mother was Angharad, daughter of Gerald and Nest. Philip succeeded his father at Manorbier. His uncle (his mother Angharad's half brother) was Robert Fitz-Stephen whose cousins were the founders of the great FitzGerald and Carew families in Ireland. Philip's full brothers were Robert and Gerald. * Robert de Barry accompanied his half-uncle Robert Fitz-Stephen in the Norman invasion of Ireland and took part in the Siege of Wexford. While some sources say that he was killed at the battle of Lismore in 1185, this is probably not true (see note below). * Gerald of Wales, alias Giraldus Cambrensis, was a clergyman and historian. He also had a half-brother - Walter.Expugnatio Hibernica by Giraldus Cambrensis; Book 1 Chapter 42 Lands in Ireland Philip de Barry came to Ireland at the end of February 1183,Expugnatio Hibernica by Giraldus Cambrensis; Book 2, Chapter 20, v94 accompanied by his brother Gerald and their followers, to take possession of his lands and to assist his half-uncle Robert Fitz-Stephen, and his first cousin Raymond FitzGerald (also known as Raymond Le Gros), in their efforts to recover lands in the modern county of Cork. These cantrefs or baronies had been expropriated by another (half) first cousin, Ralph Fitz-Stephen (or Radulph). Ralph was the grandson of Nesta by Stephen, Constable of Cardigan. In 1182 he was killed together with his father-in-law, Milo de Cogan, who had been granted of the second half of the kingdom of Cork.\\"Giraldus Cambrensis\\" v., 350, 351, Rolls edit. Robert Fitz-Stephen eventually ceded these territories to Philip, his half-nephew. These territories consisted of three cantrefs in Fitz-Stephen's half of the Kingdom of Desmond (\\"the kingdom of Cork\\") viz. Olethan, Muschiri-on-Dunnegan (or Muskerry Donegan) and Killyde (or Killede) by the service of ten knights.Smith, \\"History of Cork\\", Book 1, chapter i.Egerton MS., 75 B. M., as quoted in W. A. Copinger's \\"Historical Notes to Smith's History of Cork,\\" book ii., chapter 2. These cantrefs became the baronies or hundreds of Oliehan, Oryrry and Ogormliehan respectively. The name \\"Oliehan\\" is an anglicisation of the Gaelic U√≠ Liath√°in which refers to the early medieval kingdom of the U√≠ Liath√°in. This petty kingdom encompassed most of the land in Barrymore and the neighbouring barony of Kinnatalloon. Oryrry is currently known as the Barony of Orrery and Kilmore. The name Killyde survives in \\"Killeady Hills\\", the name of the hill country south of the city of Cork. According to Smith,Smith,\\"History of Cork \\", p.370. \\"on the north side of the city stood Shandon Castle, built by the Barrys soon after the Conquest, or, as some say, by King John,\\". According to Rev. Barry, the baronies were > \\"coextensive with the ecclesiastical deaneries of Olethan and Muscry > Donnegan in the diocese of Cloyne, and Ocurblethan, in the diocese of Cork. > According to the Taxations of A.D. 1302, 1307, as given by Sweetman, the > deanery of Olethan comprised the barony of Kinnatalloon, and the Cloyne part > of the barony of Barrymore, exclusive of the Great Island and the parish of > Mogeesha, which went with Imokilly, till taken from the Hodnets by the > Barries in A.D. 1329.

William founded the priory of St. Thomas √† Becket at Ballybeg for the Canons Regular of St. Augustine in 1229. His son, David √ìg de Barry, enlarged the revenues of the priory in 1251. :* His heir was David \\"M√≥r\\" de Barry (born circa 1195), slain at the Battle of Callan in 1261. ::* whose heir was David \\"√ìg\\" de Barry, Justiciar of Ireland in 1267, and died in 1278. * Gerald (born circa 1175), who succeeded his uncle Geraldus Cambrensis as Archdeacon of Brecon in 1203; and * a daughter, who married Walter Mancenell. Note According to the \\"Archdall's Lodge\\" (1789) source, Robert de Barry, \\"after his services in Ireland is said to seat himself at Sevington, in Kent,\\" and \\"about the year 1185 being killed at Lismore,\\". But as he was elder than his brother Gerald, who was born in 1146 or 1147, this Robert was about forty years old in 1185. The same source reports that the Robert who was slain near Lismore in that year was only an adolescens, that is between fifteen and twenty eight years of age. It is improbable therefore that Robert (aged over 40) was slain at Lismore. That person is more likely to be Philip's son, also called Robert.

It is found in the tributaries of the lower Duck and lower Tennessee Rivers. It is distinguished from other darter species by the presence of eight anal rays, as well breeding males having a unique hump behind the head reminiscent of a buffalo. Geographic distribution E. bison is found in a very small range of tributaries in Tennessee, although a population survey has not been done to assess the actual range of these species specifically. The current distribution of this species is only known to be in the tributaries of the lower Duck and Tennessee Rivers. This small area of habitats and limited sightings could be due to these fish evolving to inhabit smaller, less connected areas of these rivers, or it could be due to human disturbances, such as erosion and dam building. Ecology A dearth of literature exists on the ecology of these species explicitly, but based on similar darter ecology, as well as the slightly subterminal present mouth on the fish, they probably rest near the bottom on the creeks and rivers they inhabit. In the areas where they have been found, these darters are generally small in size and occupy the benthic zone of various freshwater habitats, including the riffles, pools, and runs of small to large streams. These fish most likely eat a diet similar to other darters, which is made up of insects and their larvae, copepods, and other small aquatic organisms. Because these fish live and hunt on the beds of smaller streams and tributaries, destruction/ defilement of these habitats could reduce populations of these species. Life history Due to the lack of research on buffalo darter life history ecology, inferences will be made based on closely related darter species found in similar habitats. Darters usually mate in the spring, with active mating occurring from early spring to early summer. Clutch sizes can vary from a few eggs to 2000 or more eggs per brood created by multiple females. Darters use nesting rocks to lay their eggs, and can either be in shallow or deep rushing water. A marked trend of male parental care exists in darters, with males keeping close to the eggs for protection. E. bison most likely has a lifespan to similar to other darters, which is typically a few years. Management No management plan is in place for this species, as it not listed as threatened or endangered in Tennessee or federally. Because population statistics of this fish are unknown, it is hard to know the state of current populations and if they are in threat or could become so. As with any aquatic species it is important to mitigate human effects on river dynamics to reduce damage to populations. To ensure the sustainability of E. bison and other fish like it, the effects of erosion due to urbanization and agriculture and the construction of dams need to be controlled. Siltation is a huge issue for small benthic fish such as these darters' it can cause physical ailments and behavioral changes.

It is also located in the Coosa River watershed which begins in Tennessee and Georgia, then enters Alabama. Its diet, close to other members of the subgenus Ulocentra, consists of small insects, including midges, black fly larvae, and small crustaceans. The two subspecies inhabit small to medium-sized gradient-rich streams. They are often found in fast-moving streams with large boulders, gravel, cobbles, and sand. They can be found in the margins between these large boulders, and use the boulders for protection from predators and for the females to attach eggs. The holiday darter has very vibrant coloration, but will display even more brilliant coloration during or before spawning. Spawning takes place during the spring, usually around April or May. This species is state listed in Georgia as threatened. One of the disjunct populations is located in the Talladega National Forest, which results in it being protected from human encroachment. The separate populations can make it difficult to determine the exact population count. Distribution The distribution of E. brevirostrum, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is known or believed to be in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, including the Conasauga River and the upper Coosa River system. It is only known to populate four different river systems, at about 18 different locations. It is believed to be extirpated in portions of its current range, and to have a stable population in the Upper Shoal Creek, and the Consauga River from Murray County, Georgia, to Polk County, Tennessee. It is ‚Äúpossibly extirpated from the Calhoun County, Alabama, section of Shoal Creek due to impoundments.‚ÄùJohnston, C.E. and K.B. Damon. 1996. Long term monitoring of rare fishes in the consauga river, Georgia and Tennessee. Unpublished report to the USDA forest service, southern research station, Oxford Mississippi. 11+ pp. This darter is highly affected by barriers that prevent movement throughout a water system. Population counts are spotty and have a wide range of results. Snorkeling has been a common method to take population counts. In the past, population counts at a single site have ‚Äúresulted in 1, 15-36, 3-13 and 4-10 individuals.‚Äù These inconsistent counts make it difficult to determine an exact population counts. Ecology The holiday darter is known for eating ‚Äú‚Ä¶aquatic insect larvae and micro crustaceans.‚Äù It prefers a habitat in relatively shallow water, which is normally between 22 and 34 cm. It can be found in areas with cobbles, large boulders, and gravel substrate, and is often found in clear streams. It prefers fast-moving water. The boulders that are present in these habitats are often covered with moss. Sand and river weed are also common.Carol E. Johnston and J.R. Shute. 1997. Observational notes on the spawning behavior of the blue shiner ( Cyprinella caerulea) and the Holiday Darter (Etheostoma brevirostrum). Two rare fishes of the Conasauga river, Georgia, and Tennessee. Number 35. It can be found in rocky runs and pools that contain riffles of cool to warm creeks that are small to medium in size. Its predators are mostly larger predatory stream fish, but no predators are known for specifically targeting this species. Threats to its population include dam construction that prevents movement and affects water quality in a stream. Also, threats include sedimentation that occurs from logging and road building. Removal or damage to the riparian zones are known to be detrimental to population counts. \\"...small changes in stream conditions, such as hydrology, storm flow, impervious surface cover, and bank height, have been demonstrated to affect minnow and darter populations\\".Phillips, B.W., and C.E. Johnston. 2004. Changes in the Fish Assemblages of Bear Creek (Tennessee River Drainage) Alabama and Mississippi: 1968‚Äì2000. Southeastern Naturalist 3(2):205‚Äì218 Life history Breeding for E. brevirostrum is much like other members of Ulocentra. They will breed in the same area in which they live; they are not known for migration or habitat movement to spawn. Spawning occurs in early spring around April and May. Often, the male positions himself over or to the side of the female as they move over the substrate. Once the female finds a suitable area for egg placement, the male will fertilize the eggs. The female will usually pick an area between cobbles or in a crevice to attach the eggs. The holiday darter has demonstrated territorial behavior when approached by other males during the spawning process. No parental care is observed after the eggs have been attached to the cobbles.Carol E. Johnston and J.R. Shute. 1997. Observational notes on the spawning behavior of the blue shiner ( Cyprinella caerulea) and the Holiday Darter (Etheostoma brevirostrum). Two rare fishes of the Conasauga river, Georgia, and Tennessee. Number 35. The average lifespan is typically about four years and they will reach sexual maturity within the first year of life. Sedimentation on rocks can make it difficult for the eggs to attach, so can hurt reproduction rates. Directly before or during spawning, males will display more vibrant colors than at other times of the year. According to Gumm and Mendelson, there are \\"...four discrete color classes in darters; red, orange, yellow, blue/green.\\"Jennifer M. Gumm, Tamra C. Mendelson. 2011. The evolution of multi-component visual signals in darters. Department of biological sciences, University of Maryland. 57(2): 125-139 During spawning, these colors are more vibrant and bright. Management Currently, no management plans are in effect for E. brevirostrum, but it is a state listed species in Alabama and is protected under the Non-Game Species regulation. Most of its populations occur in the Talladega National Forest, which provides protection and helps to keep the population numbers at a safe level. National forests have riparian streamside management zones which help in the preservation of their preferred habitat. Sediment filters are also used to prevent sedimentation from occurring and affecting their reproduction. Small impoundment is currently the largest threat, and \\"...impoundments along the creek isolate holiday darter populations.\\"Johnston, C.E., and W.W. Hartup. 2002. Distribution and habitat of the Holiday Darter in Shoal Creek, Talladega National Forest, Alabama USDA Forest Service, Montgomery, AL 16 pp. Human-induced threats to the holiday darter result in habitat fragmentation and poor water quality, which can be a result of direct pollution into a stream or poor agricultural practices by upstream land owners.

It is endemic to the eastern United States from New York and Illinois to Tennessee and North Carolina. Introduction The bluebreast darter is small in size, rarely reaching longer than three inches. The snout is a blunt, more rounded than other darters, and its gill covers do not bridge the breast. It is a colorful fish, predominantly olive green with a broad, lighter band that runs adjacent to the dark fringe of the second dorsal and anal fins, reaching the base of the caudal fin. During breeding, though, males tend to be very colorful, usually with orange-tinted dorsal fins, dark red spots along the sides, and the descriptive bright blue breast from which it gets its name.Felbaum, M., et al. 1995. Endangered and Threatened Species of Pennsylvania. Wild Resource Conservation Fund. The species is commonly found in clean-flowing, medium to large rivers with high benthic current velocity and an abundance of sedimentary gravel. Currently, E. camurum is listed as imperiled or higher in seven eastern US states. Geographic distribution This darter's range covers most of the Eastern Highlands in the US, extending latitudinally from Tennessee to New York and longitudinally from West Virginia to Illinois. Populations have historically inhabited streams in the Ohio River drainage, the Alleghany River basin (NY and PA), the Wabash River basin (IN and IL), and the Tennessee River basin (TN and NC). Its habitats in these regions have patchy distributions as a result of habitat degradation and fragmentation following the post-Pleistocene dispersal.Tiemann, J.S. 2008. Distribution and life history characteristics of the state-endangered Bluebreast darter Etheostoma camurum (cope) in Illinois. Transactions of the Illinois State Academy of Science, 3-4, 235-246. In New York, its conservation status will likely be raised to ‚Äòendangered‚Äô following its severe population decline. Likely causes of decline have been linked to physical effects, such as impoundments, and chemical effects, such as agriculture drainage runoff, to the darter's natural habitat.Smiley, P.C. Jr., Gillespie, R.B., King, K.W., & Huang, C.H.2008. Contribution of habitat and water quality to the integrity of fish communities in agriculture drainage ditches. Journal of Soil and Water Conservation. 63: 218-219. In addition, its specialized habitat makes it highly vulnerable to environmental and anthropogenic pressures. As a result of these pressures, populations have become increasingly isolated and restricted to moderate to large streams with turbid flow and high water quality.Zorach, T. 1972. Systematics of the Percid Fishes, Etheostoma camurum and E. chlorobranchium New Species, with a Discussion of the Subgenus Nothonotus. Copeia, 3, 427-447. Ecology This darter's habitat is highly specialized and dependent on water quality and stream velocity. These habitats are located in eddies and riffles behind boulders in large to moderately sized, gravel- bottomed streams.Mount, D.I. 1959. Spawning Behavior of the Bluebreast Darter, Etheostoma camurum (Cope). Copeia, 3, 240-243. More specifically, populations often exist in the benthopelagic regions in the water column, ranging from depths of 10 to 30 cm. Its diet typically consists of insect (e.g. dipteran) larvaeWerner, R.G. 2004. Freshwater fishes of the Northeastern United States: A Field Guide. Syracuse University Press, 1, 255. due mostly to morphological restraints, including an average gape size of around 8 mm. Temperature ranges year-round are unknown, but spawning water temperatures range from 10 to 24 ¬∞C. Predators for this particular species are not clear, but data on a sister species, the rainbow darter (E. caeruleum), suggest larger freshwater fish, such as burbots (Lota lota), stonecats (Noturus flavus), and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) have been known to prey on darters.Hatch, J.T & Paulson, N. 2011. Rainbow Darter. Bell Museum of Natural History.http://www.pca.state.mn.us/index.php/living-green/living-green- citizen/for-kids/creature-feature/rainbow-darter.html?menuid=819&redirect;=1. Although data are largely unknown, predation effects on the bluebreast darter are thought to be relatively low due to the small, localized habitats of this species in riffles and eddies behind boulders that prevent larger pelagic fish from exploiting them.Shiels, A.L. 1997. Pennsylvania's Dynamic Darters. Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission. http://www.fish.state.pa.us/education/catalog/darters.html . Typical anthropogenic effects detrimental to their ecology include strip mining, mica shale siltation, impoundments (dams), and agricultural drainage runoff. Life history The breeding season for this fish peaks from mid-May through June for many habitats.NatureServe. 2011. Etheostoma Camurum. NatureServe Explorer: An online encyclopedia of life. http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Etheostoma%20camurum. During this time, nuptial males develop their characteristic blue breast and brick-red spotting on their sides. Spawning begins when the males become territorial and seek out eddies and riffles in the head streams. Females soon follow and decide both the location of the reproductive event and the individual mates. Mating is stimulated once the female begins a ritual that involves a sequence of erratic darts that are then mimicked by the male. Once this occurs, the female will bury herself into a gravel shoal, nearly level with the bottom of the streambed. Then the male will approach from above and a series of vibrations, lasting no longer than 10 sec at a time, will signify each reproductive event. This is known to occur at least three times per reproductive event. About 100 eggs are laid during this time. The males then stay behind to guard the eggs during a seven- to 10-day incubation period, after which parental care ceases.Mountz, V., Hathaway, M., Smith, L., & Ervin, V. eds. 2010. Darter: Jewels of the Stream. Wild Ohio Magazine,Spring ed., 7. Data on clutch sizes are unclear for E. camurum, but studies on sister species, like the fantail darter (E. flabellare), suggest numbers range from 33 to 96 individuals.Heins, D.C. 2001. Variation in Clutch Size and Ovum Size of the Snubnose Darter (Etheostoma simoterum), from Two Populations in Tennessee. American Midland Naturalist, 145, 74-79. Sexual maturity for the juveniles is reached within the first year for most species within the genus,Stauffer, J.R. 1995. Fishes of West Virginia. Academy of Natural Sciences, 1, 311. and the typical life span for E. camurum is three years. Anthropogenic changes in water velocity can affect its breeding cycle . Also, increased turbidity due to stormwater runoff in streams can be detrimental to egg clusters buried in the gravel streambed, often causing eggs to become detached and free flowing, downstream and out of the protective care of the male. Current management The incentive for conservation action of this species stems from its role as an indicator species; spotty distributions and specialized habitats are of particular concern. Specifically, small populations, isolated by physical impoundments, have an increased risk for a host of genetic problems, including inbreeding effects, genetic drift, and loss of heterozygocity. Anthropogenic effects from siltation buildup, impoundments, strip mining, dredging, agriculture, and roadway runoff have all had detrimental impacts on its breeding and habitat. E. camurum is not currently placed on IUCN's Red list, but NatureServe recommends close monitoring of its habitat and water quality. NatureServe has currently listed E. camurum to be ‚Äòcritically imperiled‚Äô in Illinois, Alabama, Indiana, and New York, ‚Äòimperiled‚Äô in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô in West Virginia, and ‚Äòapparently secure‚Äô in Tennessee and Kentucky. Recent efforts in the Ohio River drainage have revived populations back to historical numbers. This has been achieved by attempts to improve water quality in these regions. Studies suggest increased awareness and close monitoring of streams and waterways are needed, suggesting most of the threats to the species well-being are human related. Little information exists for threats caused by predation, invasive species competition, or overfishing. Management recommendations Because of its isolated and specialized habitat, E. camurum is of particular ecological concern. Anthropogenic effects are thought to be the cause of most population decline, as increased human development has been detrimental to both habitat and breeding. Additionally, E. camurum has been linked to spawning of the endangered tan riffleshell (Epioblasma florentina walkeri). Studies have shown the riffelshell larvae attach to E. camurum during maturation. References *Eisenhour, D.J. 1995.

Cowman, was an American writer and author of the devotional books Streams in the Desert and Springs in the Valley. Cowman published her books under the author name Mrs. Charles E. Cowman. She was also one of the cofounders of The Oriental Missionary Society (later known as OMS International, and eventually One Mission Society). Early life Lettie Burd Cowman was born on March 3, 1870, in Afton, Iowa to Isaac and Margaret Burd. At 13 years of age, she met her future husband, Charles Cowman, a young telegraph operator. Six years later, on June 8, 1889, they were married. Charles was also one of the co-founders of The Oriental Missionary Society. Lettie and Charles lived in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, for the first year of their marriage. After living there for a year, the high altitude of the Rocky Mountains caused Lettie to become very ill. They were forced to move back to Chicago, where they lived for the next 10 years. While there, Charles worked at the same telegraph office where he had previously worked.Cowman, Lettie B., Missionary Warrior, OMS International, Inc., 1989. One Mission Society  Japan On February 1, 1901, the Cowmans left the United States to work as missionaries in Japan. They worked alongside Juji Nakada, a friend they had met at their church in Chicago. In 1902, a friend from the telegraph office, Ernest Kilbourne, joined them to aid their growing ministry. The Cowmans, Nakada, and Kilbourne are considered the four cofounders of the Oriental Missionary Society. Bible Training Institutes The work in Japan continued to grow. By 1903, two Bible Training Institutes had opened in Japan. These schools held classes during the day, and in the evening hosted evangelical services open to the public. Dozens flooded in nightly to hear the preaching of Juji Nakada. A Bible Training Institute was open in Seoul in 1910. The Great Village Campaign It was clear that all four co-founders had a deep burden on their heart for the people of Japan. They wanted to reach as many people as they could with the Gospel. Although they were making huge strides in their goals, Charles was not satisfied. This led to the start of the Great Village Campaign in 1913. His goal was for every person in Japan to hear the Gospel within the next five years. Teams of missionaries went to every town, village and home throughout Japan, proclaiming the Gospel and distributing Bibles. When Charles' health took a turn downward in 1917, he and Lettie were forced to return to America. In January 1918, they received news through the O.M.S. Standard that the Great Village Campaign was complete. About 60 million Japanese were equipped with the Gospel, covering of land.  Writing career Electric Messages (OMS Outreach) Cowman began writing in November 1902 when OMS co-founder Ernest Kilbourne initiated a monthly publication called Electric Messages.'. She wrote monthly reports of the work being accomplished. These reports were then mailed to supporters in the United States. The name was later changed to The O.M.S. Standard, and is currently named OMS Outreach. Streams in the Desert After the Cowmans returned to the United States in January 1918, Charles' health continued to decline. As he suffered in pain, Lettie suffered, watching her husband slowly fade away. During this time, her best-selling devotional book, Streams in the Desert, was conceived. Lettie wrote a daily devotional based on her hardships and her experiences of fellowship with God. Each daily section contains a Bible passage and a quote from another author. The title of the book comes from Isaiah 35:6, \\"Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.\\"Erny, Edward & Esther, No Guarantee But God, OMS International, Inc., 2000. No one expected Streams to be as successful as it was. Cowman was not seeking success during the time she wrote it. When the book was being printed, her publisher was certain they would never publish more than the original printing of 3,000. Yet, many readers found they could connect with Streams because it \\"spoke to those who had difficulty relating their own sufferings to the noble and eternal purposes of a loving and all-wise God.\\" Cowman often stated, \\"I did not write Streams. God gave me Streams.\\"Pearson, B.H., The Vision Lives, OMS International, Inc., 1982.  Missionary Warrior  Charles died in September 1924. After his death, Lettie found a note addressed to her in his Bible, stating, \\"Go on with my unfinished task.\\" Despite her grieving, she knew that she had work to complete. The year following her husband's death, Cowman wrote Missionary Warrior, a biography of Charles Cowman's life. In writing this, she hoped that \\"a world-wide crusade [would] be launched to reach every living member of this generation with the gospel.\\" After Charles' death, OMS' work continued with co-founder E.A. Kilbourne as the organization's second President. Lettie continued serving with OMS as one of the co-founders. When Kilbourne died four years after Charles, Lettie became the third President of OMS.  Every Creature Crusade  In the midst of her new writing career, Lettie continued serving as President of OMS as her first priority. She was determined to carry out the Every Creature Crusade (now known as Every Community for Christ), which Charles started in Japan as the Great Village Campaign. She began speaking at camp meetings and conventions. Just as Charles felt such a strong calling to proclaim the Gospel to every individual in Japan, Lettie felt a similar call to distribute the Gospel to all the nations. They had already been to Japan, Korea, and China, so they began to make plans to go to India, Africa, South America, Europe; all the nations of the earth. In Europe, they expanded into countries such as Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. This crusade marked one of the last great evangelistic efforts in Europe before Nazi Germany took control. In Africa, Egypt was a country for which Lettie felt a great burden. In North America, Cuba was a country of focus (Page 130). In December 1941, a crusade began in Mexico. Over the course of five years, the total evangelical church membership doubled (Page 166). In 1943, the Oriental Missionary Society entered South America, something Lettie never dreamed would happen. The right doors opened, and a Bible Training Institute began that year in Medell√≠n, Colombia.  Cowman Publications, Inc. and World Gospel Crusades  In the fall of 1949, Lettie knew that her time as President of OMS had come to an end. She stepped down from the role with the hope that the mission's book department and crusade department would be released to form another corporation. They were and she accepted the presidency for the new corporation under two names: Cowman Publications, Inc. and World Gospel Crusades.  Death  In 1957, at 87 years of age, Lettie became very ill. Three years later, she died on Easter Sunday, April 17, 1960.

Background Ivani≈° Berislaviƒá was a member of the House of Berislaviƒá, a Croatian noble family from Slavonia, subordinate to the Kingdom of Hungary. Life After the death of despot Jovan Brankoviƒá (1502), Vladislaus II of Hungary made Ivani≈° Berislaviƒá the interim despot of Serbia. With no male successor to the Brankoviƒá dynasty, the position was given to the Berislaviƒá family which had already been intertwined with the Brankoviƒá dynasty with the marriage of Ivan's cousin Franjo Berislaviƒá and Barbara Frankopan, who had been the widow of Vuk Brankoviƒá II. In addition, their estates shared borders, and despot ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá as well as Jovan had been supporters of Mathias Corvinus like the Berislaviƒás. Nevertheless, the decision was apparently not welcomed in Serbia, where the local chroniclers would not mention Ivani≈° Berislaviƒá by name, likely because they had expected the privilege to pass to the Serbian House of Jak≈°iƒá, who were also in the service of the Hungarian king. The official act of making Ivani≈° the despot was confirmed by January 1504 in Buda, when his marriage with Jovan's widow Jelena (n√©e Jak≈°iƒá) was arranged, and he received the title of despot of Serbia. The marriage itself was postponed until May 1504 because of Jelena's illness. Ivani≈° was made protector of the Orthodox Church in Hungary, and in charters he signed as \\"In God's Grace, the Despot of Serbia\\". The defence of the southern border of the Kingdom of Hungary was handled by Berislaviƒá as despot, with the support of Stevan, Marko and Petar Jak≈°iƒá, Stjepan Bradaƒç, and the armed forces of Belgrade and ≈†abac. His son, Stefan, had the title of \\"Serbian Despot\\" until his defeat in battle against the Ottomans in 1535. Berislaviƒá received the former appanage of Jovan, which the Hungarians had confiscated upon his death. His residence was at Kupinik, in Srem. Berislaviƒá was also named the \\"Ban of Jajce\\" in 1511, replacing Baltazar Alapiƒá. He took an oath to secure the southern borders of Hungary and to be loyal to his people. He also had a seat at Brod on the Sava, from where he watched his cities in Srem and Slavonia, including Jajce Banovina. Because his duties involved a significant effort as well as financial cost, he repeatedly asked the Hungarian King to remove him from service as Ban of Jajce in 1513, and the King complied on May 25. This was the last mention of him alive, and he is assumed to have died in 1514, because his wife despot Jelena is mentioned as the Lord of the Despot's military forces.

It is an adaptation of Matthew Lewis's gothic novel of the same name. It chronicles the story of a Capucin Ambrosio (Vincent Cassel), a well-respected monk in Spain, concluding in his downfall. It was released in France on 13 July 2011. The film was partially shot in the barri vell of the city of Girona, Catalonia (Spain). Plot An abandoned baby is taken in by a Spanish monastery, and raised as a monk, christened Capuchin Ambrosio. An exceptional preacher, Ambrosio is respected by all. One day a masked figure by the name of Valerio from Burgos arrives at the monastery with his godfather, explaining the mask as necessary due to terrible burns inflicted on him in a fire that killed his parents. He expresses a desire to join the monastery which is initially shunned by several of the monks, however Ambrosio convinces them to not fear his differences, and to accept him. Valerio later reveals to Ambrosio that he is actually a woman by the name of Matilda, and Ambrosio orders her to leave. As a last request she asks for a rose from his rose garden, and upon reaching in to pluck one for her, Ambrosio is bitten by a giant centipede. As he becomes delirious from the effects of the venom, he is seduced by Matilda and compromises his faith. Another lady, Antonia, who had recently heard him preach comes to the monastery to ask that Ambrosio see her sick mother. He complies and is told of a story by the sickly mother that she left a son named Mateo that was lost years ago and this troubles her soul. Driven by a carnal lust for Matilda, Ambrosio transgresses and he is soon found desiring the innocent Antonia now. He also sees apparitions of the pregnant nun he condemned to death by turning her over to the prioress. Matilda recognizes Ambrosio's new interest in the fair Antonia and uses magic spells to help the monk in his pursuit of her. She resists and her rape by him and discovery of her murdered mother (at the hand of Ambrosio) leads to her insanity. As her mother dies, she utters the word \\"Mateo\\", indicating that Ambrosio now knows that he is the older brother of Antonia. Returning to the monastery, Ambrosio is delivered to the Inquisition where he is condemned to death by starvation. He escapes only when Matilda, revealing herself as an instrument of Satan in female form, leads him to her master. The Devil offers Ambrosio an eternity of pleasure by selling his soul, but Ambrosio demands instead the deal to be used to save Antonia from madness. He then dies, without hope for himself, and is corpse is devoured by crows.

It is endemic to the eastern United States. Geographic distribution The greenfin darter is primarily restricted to the fast-flowing, mountainous streams and rivers of the upper Tennessee River drainage area, in North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. The species' range stretches from the upper Holston and Watauga Rivers, south through the French Broad and Little Tennessee Rivers, and ultimately ends at the Hiwassee River.Etnier, D. A., & Starnes, W. C. (1993). Fishes of Tennessee (pp. 478‚Äì479). University of Tennessee press. Ecology The greenfin darter is a benthic insectivore, feeding mainly on insect larvae in cold, high-elevation creeks and rivers. A study by Bryant et al. revealed the diet of the greenfin darter may be the most diverse in the genus, with some individuals' guts containing up to 15 different species of insects. Its predators are mainly larger freshwater fish, such as smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and madtoms (genus Notorus). Darters in general are important food sources for many fish.Kuehne, R., R. Barbour. 1983. The American Darters. Lexington, Kentucky: The University Press of Kentucky. Freshwater eels commonly consume adult darters, and suckerfish prey on their eggs. The species is relatively abundant, and has been found to hybridize with E. camurum and E. rufilineatum, where ranges overlap. Like many other darter species, the greenfin has adapted morphologically to reduce drag and allow stationary positioning on the substrate even in the midst of fast- flowing riffles.Carlson, R.L and G.V. Lauder. 2010. Living on the Bottom: Kinematics of Benthic Station-Holding in Darter Fishes (Percidae: Etheostomatinae). Journal of Morphology (271): 25-35. Life cycle Spawning occurs from late May to early August. Females bury themselves in the substrate in areas protected from strong currents, and release eggs upon the arrival of a mate. The male may remain at the spawning site for several hours, guarding the eggs. Growth is extremely rapid, with juveniles reaching 45 mm in just a year. Mean length is 62 mm, with some individuals reaching as much as 110 mm. Lifespans can be up to five years. E. chlorobranchium is thought to be the largest species in the subgenus Nothonotus. Environmental status E. chlorobranchium has not been evaluated by the IUCN, although it is classified as state threatened in Georgia. However, the species is found and protected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Southern Appalachian Biosphere reserve. Greenfin populations are certainly vulnerable to siltation, water impoundment (or any change to water velocity), and agricultural runoff. A close relative, E. camurum, has seen huge population declines due to anthropogenic environmental disturbances, and is listed as critically imperiled in several states.Smiley, P.C., R. B. Gillespie, K. W. King, and C. Huang. 2009. Management implications of the relationships between water chemistry and fishes within channelized headwater streams in the Midwestern United States. Ecohydrology (2): 294-302. Hybridization between E. chlorobranchium, E. camurum, and E. rufilineatum does not appear to be a threat to the species.Eisenhour, DJ. 1995. Systematics of Etheostoma camurum and E. chlorobranchium (Osteichthyes, Percidae) in the Tennessee and Cumberland River drainages with analysis of hybridization in the Nolichucky river system. Copeia 2:368-379. Additionally, climate change may force the greenfin into higher elevations, and into smaller streams. This will almost certainly lead to population declines. Because of its position as an important food source for larger fish in the Tennessee River drainage area, it is important for this species to be assessed and monitored in the future.

Watkins Glen International is one of two road courses to hold NASCAR races, the other being Infineon Raceway. The standard short road course at Watkins Glen International is a 7-turn course that is long; the track was modified in 1992, adding the Inner Loop, which lengthened the long course to and the short course to the current length of . Before the race, Carl Edwards was leading the Drivers' Championship with 720 points, and Jimmie Johnson stood in second with 711 points. Kyle Busch and Kurt Busch followed in third and fourth with 709 and 706 points, six ahead of Kevin Harvick and 38 ahead Jeff Gordon in fifth and sixth. Ryan Newman with 658 was 16 points ahead of Tony Stewart and 19 ahead of Dale Earnhardt, Jr. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was first with 140 points, 21 ahead of Ford, and 26 ahead of Toyota. Dodge was placed fourth with 89 points. Juan Pablo Montoya is the race's defending winner from 2010. Kyle Busch began leading, but when they entered turn 1 of the last two laps, he turned too far and immediately in second place Brad Keselowski and Marcos Ambrose in third place passed him. Keselowski lead until Marcos Ambrose quickly took the lead in the Inner Loop. Ambrose continued to lead when a major crash occurred at turn 2 in the final lap involving Boris Said, David Ragan, David Reutimann and few other cars that saw Reutimann go airborne and end up on his roof. This accident did not bring out the caution flag, but was brought out soon after when Tony Stewart spun out of control at the Inner Loop and Ambrose won the race.

Ed. Stanley Sadie. Grove Music Online. The duet is sung twice in the opera's second act, first by the miller-woman Rachelina (soprano) and Calloandro (tenor) and then by Rachelina and the notary Pistofolo (baritone).Glenn Paton, John. 26 Italian Songs and Arias: An Authoritative Edition Based on Authentic Sources. Van Nuys: Alfred Publishing, 1991. The duet is notable as its theme has been used many times as a basis for other musical works, and due to its inclusion in Alessandro Parisotti's 1885 collection ', the song has secured a place in classical vocal pedagogy.  Music  The duet is written in the key of G major with a time signature. The voices are accompanied by violins, viola and continuo. There is an 8 measure instrumental introduction followed by 20 measures of Rachelina singing the theme. Calloandro repeats these 20 measures with new text before Rachelina joins him for 12 more that repeat half of the theme. The orchestra then concludes the piece with 4 measures. After some recitative, Calloandro leaves the stage and Pistofolo appears. The duet is repeated entirely as before, but this time with Pistofolo (who sings an entirely new set of words) rather than Calloandro. Without ornamentation, the range for each singer covers the interval of a minor seventh (from F#4 to E5 for Rachelina and F#3 to E4 for Calloandro and Pistofolo). The duet would have been ornamented by singers according to the custom of the day.  Influence  Beethoven composed six variations in G major for piano, WoO 70, in 1795. Other composers that have used the theme include Paganini (\\"Introduction and variations in G major\\" for violin, Op. 38, MS 44, 1827), Fernando Sor (Fantasie, Op. 16 for guitar 1823), Friedrich Silcher (flute and piano), Mauro Giuliani (guitar and keyboard), Giovanni Bottesini (for double bass), Nicola Antonio Manfroce, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, and Johann Baptist Wanhal.  Lyrics  {Rachelina: |style=\\"padding-left:2em;\\"In my heart I no more feel the sparkle of youth. The cause of my torment, o Love, it is your fault. You tease me, you bite me, you prick me, you pinch me. What is this thing in me! Pity, pity, pity! Love is a certain something, which makes me despair. I hear you, yes I hear you, beautiful flower of youth. The cause of my torment, o my soul, it is you. You tease me, you bite me, you prick me, you pinch me. What is this thing, alas! Pity, pity, pity! That face is one which makes me delirious. A flag to every wind, I know this is you: From one to a hundred you are making fun of youth. You tease, you bite, you prick, you pinch. So everyone cries: alas! Pity, pity, pity! That woman is the one burning me. |}  Arie Antiche  When Alessandro Parisotti included this work in his collection of Arie Antiche (1885), he created a solo version by including only the first 28 measures of the duet. He also changed the key to F major and added ornaments without preserving the original melody.Parisotti, Alessandro. Arie Antiche, Vol. 1. Milan: Ricordi, 1885. The song was later included in G. Schirmer's Twenty-Four Italian Songs and Arias. It is in this form that the duet has become familiar to modern audiences. In concert, it is typically repeated with the repeat being more heavily ornamented. References Notes Sources * Paisiello, Giovanni. L'amor contrastato, oissia La molinara. Manuscript, n.d.

Uses of SNMP Simulator  SNMP Simulators are used for development, testing, and training of network management system software. Before the advent of simulators, actual physical equipment was used.

Olympic Swimming and Diving, p. 14 (2007) By the 1920s, it began to lose its popularity and slowly disappeared from U.S. and English swim competitions. Description Preparing to plunge According to the 1920 Official Swimming Guide of the American Swimming Association, the plunge for distance \\"is a dive from a stationary take-off which is free from spring from a height of 18 inches above the water. Upon reaching the water the plunger glides face downward for a period of 60 seconds without imparting any propulsion to the body from the arms and legs.\\" To determine the total distance traveled, the measurement was taken from the farthest part of the body from the start, \\"opposite a point at right angles to the base line.\\"Official Swimming Guide 1919-20, p. 85-86 (1920) Generally, being fat was an advantage in the sport.Handley, Louis de B.

Swimming and Diving, p.44-47 (1922) John Kiernan, sports writer for the New York Times, once described the event as the \\"slowest thing in the way of athletic competition\\", and that \\"the stylish-stout chaps who go in for this strenuous event merely throw themselves heavily into the water and float along like icebergs in the ship lanes.\\"Kieran, John (16 March 1930). Sports of the Times, The New York Times Similarly, an 1893 English report on the sport noted that spectators were not enamored of it, as the diver \\"moves after thirty or forty feet at a pace somewhat akin to a snail, and to the uninitiated the contests appear absolute wastes of time.\\"Henry, William and Sinclair, Archibland.

Zimbabwe's Frank Parrington, 85, Swimming World Magazine Female swimmers also competed in the plunge. American swimmer Charlotte Boyle (also a 1920 Olympian) set the American record a few times between 1917 and 1920, reaching 66 feet at an exhibition meet in March 1920. Two Detroit Northern High School students, Helen Nolan and Dorothy McWood, set records in the early 1920s, which McWood reportedly setting a new American record of 66 feet 10 inches in April 1922. Hilda Dand set a new world's record of 71 feet in 1925. On the men's side, Bootle's last record of 82 feet 7 inches set in 1906 stood for 14 years, until broken by two inches by 17-year- old Fred Schwedt of Detroit in 1920. English swimmer Francis Parrington smashed that record in 1926 by traveling 85 feet 6 inches, and in 1933 he hit 86 feet 8 inches, which remains the world record. In 1941, sportswriter John Kieran referenced the sport as once \\"a regular event in swimming meets\\" but \\"now abandoned.\\"Keiran, John (20 January 1941). Plunging Ahead Through Hot Water, The New York Times There is some evidence that the quirky nature of the sport is occasionally gaining the attention of modern swimmers. In June 2012, Danish female swimmer Laura Funch successfully plunged the full length of a 25-meter (82 feet) pool in approximately 101 seconds.(26 June 2012).

Variations A feet first plunge. Swimmers were cautioned to watch their heads before attempting this older variation.In shorter pools, a variation of the event was based on how fast the contestant traveled the length of the pool. For example, in 1927, it was reported that R.E. Howell had set a new world's record in a 60-foot tank, going \\"the length of the pool in 0:14 2-5.\\"(17 February 1927). Howell of Chicago A.A. Sets New World's Mark in Plunge, The New York Times Competitions were also reported at 75-foot lengths.(17 January 1920). Yale Swimmers Defeat Columbia, The New York Times (reporting that Richard Meagher of Yale had set a new collegiate record of 47 4-5 seconds) An 1893 English book on swimming also notes the existence of a variation of plunging where participants dive feet first, which it reports to already be rarely practiced. In all plunge events, because divers could not control where they drifted after diving, typically one diver competed at a time. A 1922 A.A.U. rule change planned to make plungers dive in groups, causing concern that collisions would inevitably occur among participants.(8 January 1922). Swimming Rules Arouse Criticism, The New York Times Records Compiling accurate details of record plunges presents some difficulty, as sometimes records were set in exhibition competitions, and American and English sources do not always seem to check to see whether a claimed \\"world record\\" was perhaps only a national record, but available sources do appear to confirm the following records: Men's distance plunge world record (60 second limit) * 86 feet 8 inches.

Annually, adult and continuing education leaders from around the world are selected for induction into the IACE Hall of Fame. History The story of the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame officially began in the early 1990s with the desire to provide a mechanism to honor and document contributions of the past to better build the future. Dr. Thurman J. White, a pioneer in the field of continuing education for adult and nontraditional students, contributor to the theoretical base of adult education and initiator of the Oklahoma College of Continuing Education at University of Oklahoma, initiated this idea in cooperation with current leaders and officers of several associations and organizations in the USA (University Continuing Education Association, American Society for Training and Development, AAACE/American Association of Adult and Continuing Education,http://www.aaace.org ECOP/National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges). The Hall was incorporated in the state of Oklahoma on September 20, 1995, as a nonprofit corporation. The Hall of Fame, in the beginning focused mostly to the USA, more and more inducted members from other countries. In 2006 the first induction ceremony took place out of the USA (Bamberg, Germany).http://www.uni- bamberg.de/fileadmin/andragogik/08/andragogik/andragogy/HOF/06-HOF- Bamberg.html Logo of the society: alt=Logo Header Structure The Hall of Fame operates with a small central staff in the Office of the Vice President for Outreach at the University of Oklahoma. Inducted members elect a Board of Directors, which manages the induction process and organizes symposia and other Hall activities. Hall of Fame Members Scholars, practitioners, and policy makers reflect the diversity of adult and continuing education practice and scholarship and the increasingly global leadership community that constitutes the IACE Hall of Fame. Anyone may nominate a candidate for induction into the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame. A Selection Committee reviews nominations and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, which selects the final group to be inducted every year. The Nomination Instructions claim: \\"To be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame, a person must be eminently distinguished in the profession, shall have brought honor or distinction, and shall have contributed to the heritage of adult and continuing education.\\"http://www.halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/IACEHOF%20Nomination_form%202011.doc Since the first induction in 1996, the Hall of Fame has inducted more than 250 membershttp://www.halloffame.outreach.ou.edu/inductees.html from 27 nations.

Early years The daughter of a music dean and his wife, a well-known pianist, Bodil Hammerich studied acting at the Royal Danish Theatre in the 1890s.  Career  Rosing worked as a stage actress in Denmark, performing for three years with the Royal Danish Theatre. During the early 1920s, she made one or two stage appearances on Broadway, including Fools Errant (1922), while raising her children alone.Bodil Rosing short biography, allmovie.com; accessed July 28, 2015.Bodil Rosing biography; ibdb.com; accessed July 28, 2015. She was retired from acting when she came to Hollywood in 1924, where her daughter married actor Monte Blue. There, she was suddenly chosen to play a film role, in Pretty Ladies (1925). Rosing was under studio contract at MGM and often played matronly roles such as servants, housekeepers, cooks, or mothers. Her most notable role was perhaps Janet Gaynor's faithful maid in F.W. Murnau's silent film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927). With the advent of sound film, she mostly portrayed foreigners and proved herself an extremely versatile actress in a variety of ethnicities, in about 85 films until her death. She appeared as the wife of her Danish compatriot, Jean Hersholt, in The Painted Veil (1934) with Greta Garbo, replacing the originally cast Beulah Bondi to bring a warmer look to the role. She also played the German neighbor of Lionel Barrymore in You Can't Take It With You (1938) by Frank Capra.  Personal life  Rosing married a Norwegian doctor, Einer Jansen, in 1898; the couple had four children. They divorced in 1919.  Death  Rosing died of a heart attack, aged 64. Shortly before her death, Rosing stated about her acting: \\"My goal has always been to reach the heart of my audience.\\" Partial filmography * Pretty Ladies (1925) - Minor Role (uncredited) * The Tower of Lies (1925) - Midwife (uncredited) * Lights of Old Broadway (1925) - Widow Gorman * The Volga Boatman (1926) - Tartar Woman (uncredited) * The Sporting Lover (1926) - Nora O'Brien * It Must Be Love (1926) - Mom Schmidt * The Midnight Kiss (1926) - Swedish maid * The Return of Peter Grimm (1926) - Marta (uncredited) * The City (1926) - Sarah * Stage Madness (1927) - Maid * Sunrise (1927) - The Maid * Blondes by Choice (1927) - Caroline Bennett * Wild Geese (1927) - Mrs. Sandbo * The Law of the Range (1928) - Mother of Jim and the Kid * The Big Noise (1928) - Ma Sloval * The Port of Missing Girls (1928) - Elsa * Ladies of the Mob (1928) - Yvonne's Mother * Wheel of Chance (1928) - Sara Turkeltaub * Out of the Ruins (1928) - M√®re Gilbert * The Fleet's In (1928) - Mrs. Deane * The Woman from Moscow (1928) - Nadia * King of the Rodeo (1929) - Mother * Why Be Good?

The 1600 was approved in Australia in November 1993 and was used on Jabiru production aircraft. In November 2014 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority proposed restricting all Jabiru-powered aircraft to day-visual flight rules only, without passengers or solo students and within gliding distance of a safe place to land due to the engine line's safety record. Both the manufacturer and Recreational Aviation Australia opposed the restrictions as unnecessary and unwarranted. The final rule adopted somewhat softened the restrictions, allowing the carriage of passengers and students, but requiring them to sign an acknowledgement of risk before flying and restricting equipped aircraft to day VFR flight and within gliding distance of a safe place to land.

He spent the majority of his professional career with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He also spent time in the NFL with the Chicago Bears. He played college football for Boise State University. He is the son of former Major League Baseball (MLB) player Max Venable as well as the younger brother of former MLB player Will Venable. Early years Venable attended San Rafael High School before transferring to St. Thomas More School in Oakdale, CT. He then went on to Glendale Community College before transferring to Boise State in the spring of 2009. After transferring, Venable immediately earned a spot on the Broncos roster for the upcoming season. He would go on to start all 14 games that season. He first made an impact in an early season game against Fresno State when he recorded the first score of the game off a 30-yard interception returned for a touchdown. He is remembered by many fans for his hit on Fresno quarterback Ryan Colburn later in that same game, in which he launched himself head first, leaping over a would-be blocker, narrowly missing a sack. 2010 Fiesta Bowl After an undefeated regular season the Broncos were matched up against fellow undefeated TCU to play in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Despite being a relatively low scoring game, the final minutes became exciting after a fake punt attempt by the Broncos led to a score. With a 17‚Äì10 lead, 1:06 remaining on the clock and TCU on their own 1-yard line, the Broncos simply needed to prevent a touchdown. But TCU, led by quarterback Andy Dalton covered nearly 60 yards in under 45 seconds, setting themselves up for a potential game tying score. However, on the ensuing play Dalton threw a pass towards the left sideline which was intercepted by Venable to seal the victory. Professional career NFL Chicago Bears On July 27, 2011, following the resolution of a labor dispute between the NFL Players Association and team owners, Venable was signed by the Chicago Bears as an undrafted free agent. On September 9, 2011 Venable was fined $20,000 by the NFL for a hit he delivered on Cleveland Browns receiver Demetrius Williams in the team's final preseason game. On May 3, 2012, the Bears decided to waive him after selecting free safety Brandon Hardin in the 2012 NFL Draft. Despite his short tenure on the Bears, Venable managed to carry over the reputation as a hard-hitting defensive back he had earned in college. Said Lance Briggs when discussing the Bears lack of consistency at the safety position during the 2011 season \\"So between those guys, and whoever gets back there and plays, even if it's Winston Venable, I know one thing that Winston's going to do. He's going to hit somebody. So we're confident in the guys we have back there.\\" CFL Montreal Alouettes On October 3, 2012, Venable signed with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. In 2014, he amassed 52 defensive tackles including a career-high of nine in a game against the Ottawa REDBLACKS. Venable also recovered a league-high four fumbles and recorded 14 special teams tackles. Venable continued to be a major contributor for the Als in the following two seasons, totaling 191 tackles and 12 sacks in 35 games. Following the 2016 season Venable was not re-signed by Montreal and became a free agent on February 14, 2017. Toronto Argonauts On February 15, 2017, Venable signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League as a free agent. On May 31, 2017 (at the start of training camp), Venable announced his retirement. Coaching career Following his retirement, Venable returned to Boise State to complete his degree. During that time, he often showed up at the Broncos practices and volunteering in various capabilities. Venable was hired to be the Broncos player development coordinator in June of 2018. He was named the assistant director of player performance in 2019 and was later promoted to running backs coach and co-special teams coordinator in 2020.

Her works include: The Adventures of Neddy and Teddy Fairy, What Do You Feed an Imaginary Dragon? and PJ's Bedtime Stories. Her first book, Michael O'Brian and the Magic Hat was released in 2008.http://www.griffieworld.com/2010/11/review-42-giggle-grump-gurgle-by-pj- cowan/ Early life The 1930s were depression years, and there was no money for books. Cowan's mother would make up stories to entertain her two daughters. From age three until age nine, Cowan lived at Sacred Heart Orphanage and Boarding School on Sprague Street in Pueblo, Colorado, where she struggled with dyslexia, which prevented her from being able to read. As the nuns read to the class, she memorized the stories she liked until she knew them by heart.http://storiesbypj.com/about.html/ These experiences gave her a lasting love of the art of storytelling. Pricilla attended Granite High School in Salt Lake City. In her senior year she met William Loveland. they were married in 1952 in Salt Lake City. They had two children, Jolene Marie and Michael Bruce Loveland. They divorced in 1955. She later married Ralph Colvin in Portland Oregon. they had five sons. Kelly James, Ralph Clifford, Steven Daniel, Robert Henry, and Thomas Harrison Colvin. In 1977 Pricilla met and married Vernon Dale Cowan; they celebrated their 40th year in March 2017. Vernon currently resides in Memory Care unit. In July 2016, Pricilla moved into the Legacy Retirement residence in South Jordon, Utah, where she continues to write her stories, and donate her books PJ has 11 grandchildren and 15 great grandchildren. The grandchildren range in age from 3 months to 19 years. The ‚Äúgreats‚Äù are widely scattered, so PJ and husband Vernon don‚Äôt see them often. The stories are her way of giving them a great grannies advice and council. It is her wish that they pass the books on to their own children. Writing career Cowan's writing began in earnest at age 72. In the beginning, she self-published on Lulu and while working with them met LK Gardner-Griffie, who went on to become her mentor. Gardner-Griffie is now a celebrated two-time winner of the teen awards for her series Misfit McCabe. Cowan published her first book, Michael O'Brian and the Magic Hat at the age of 74.http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewArticle.asp?id=46794) She had created the story to entertain her great-grandchildren and was encouraged by the response that it got as she began to share the story publicly. The book received favorable reviews and so she began to write and publish more books. To date, she has published 40 children's books. Seven have been translated into Spanish by Lana Kleypas. Several of her books, including Silly Little Storieshttps://www.amazon.com/Silly-Little-Stories-ebook/dp/B0058PEIR8 have been illustrated by Northwest artist Jasen Strong/Alfie Vann, illustrated: 9 books. Other artists include: Mike Motz of Canada, who along with several of his talented crew are responsible for the first ten books.

PJ's books are printed by Mira Digital Publishing, www.mirabooksmart.com Charity In 2009, Cowan decided that she wanted to share her stories with as many children as possible. She reached out to her mentor LK Gardner-Griffie, who suggested she donate them to shelters. Gardner-Griffie suggested PJ get in touch with another author, Linda Welch, author of the paranormal series Whisperings. Welch, who was managing a Shelter in Utah provided PJ with a list, and she began donating copies of her books to young children in homeless shelters. PJ then reached out to family, friends, and cyber friends for more names of shelters, day care, children's hospitals, and other organizations.

The modern environmental movement has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe ecological footprint overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the climate change problem. Something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is systemic change resistance. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.John Sterman, \\"Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10. Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem While environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change, the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first Earth Day in 1970, in which over 20 million people participated, with publication of The Limits to Growth in 1972, and with the first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972. Early expectations the problem could be solved ran high. 114 out of 132 members of the United Nations attended the Stockholm conference. The conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success:Environmental Encyclopedia, Second Edition, W. P. Cunningham et al., editors, 1998, page 1054. : \\"Many believe the most important result of the conference was the precedent it set for international cooperation in addressing environmental degradation. The nations attending agreed they shared responsibility for the quality of the environment, particularly the oceans and the atmosphere, and they signed a declaration of principles, after extensive negotiations, concerning their obligations. The conference also approved an environmental fund and an ‚Äòaction program,‚Äô which involved 200 specific recommendations for addressing such problems as global climate change, marine pollution, population growth, the dumping of toxic wastes, and the preservation of biodiversity. A permanent environment unit was established for coordinating these and other international efforts. [This later became] the United Nations Environmental Program [which was] was formally approved by the General Assembly later that same year and its base established in Nairobi, Kenya. This organization not only coordinated action but monitored research, collecting and disseminating information, and it has played an ongoing role in international negotiations about environmental issues. :\\"The conference in Stockholm accomplished almost everything the preparatory committed had planned. It was widely considered successful, and many observers were almost euphoric about the extent of agreement.\\" However, despite the work of a worldwide environmental movement, many national environmental protection agencies, creation of the United Nations Environment Programme, and many international environmental treaties, the sustainability problem continues to grow worse. The latest ecological footprint data shows the world's footprint increased from about 50% undershoot in 1961 to 50% overshoot in 2007, the last year data is available.John Talbert et al., The Genuine Progress Indicator 2006, A Tool for Sustainable Development, Redefining Progress, The Nature of Economics, 2006, available at . In 1972 the first edition of The Limits to Growth analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a system dynamics model. The widely influential book predicted that:\\"The Limits to Growth\\", Meadows et al., 1972, p23. :\\"If the present trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity some time in the 21st century.\\" Yet thirty-two years later in 2004 the third edition reported that:\\"Limits to Growth\\", Meadows et al., 2004, p xvi. :\\"[The second edition of Limits to Growth] was published in 1992, the year of the global summit on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro. The advent of the summit seemed to prove that global society had decided to deal seriously with the important environmental problems. But we now know that humanity failed to achieve the goals of Rio. The Rio plus 10 conference in Johannesburg in 2002 produced even less; it was almost paralyzed by a variety of ideological and economic disputes, [due to] the efforts of those pursuing their narrow national, corporate, or individual self-interests. :\\"...humanity has largely squandered the past 30 years.\\" Change resistance runs so high that the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters, China and the United States, have never adopted the Kyoto Protocol treaty. In the US resistance was so strong that in 1999 the US Senate voted 95 to zero against the treaty by passing the Byrd‚ÄìHagel Resolution, despite the fact Al Gore was vice-president at the time. Not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty, which has not been brought back to the floor since. Due to prolonged change resistance, the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions are rising much faster than IPCC models expected: ‚ÄúThe growth rate of [fossil fuel] emissions was 3.5% per year for 2000-2007, an almost four fold increase from 0.9% per year in 1990-1999. ‚Ä¶ This makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario.‚Äù \\"Emissions rising faster this decade than last\\", CISIRO Media Release, September 25, 2008, available at . The Copenhagen Climate Summit of December 2009 ended in failure.\\"The Hartwell Paper\\", Prins, Gwrn et al., May 2010, available at . No agreement on binding targets was reached. The Cancun Climate Summit in December 2010 did not break the deadlock. The best it could do was another non-binding agreement:Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention, 2010, available at . :‚ÄúRecognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all Parties.‚Äù This indicates no progress at all since 1992, when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was created at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The 2010 Cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the 1992 agreement said:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, United Nations, 1992, p2-4, available at . :\\"The Parties to this Convention... [acknowledge] that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response.... [thus the parties recognize] that States should enact effective environmental legislation...

The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems Understanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem. Tanya Markvart's 2009 thesis on Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability stated that:Tanya I. Markvart, Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability: An Interdisciplinary Theoretical Framework and Illustrative Application to Provincial-Municipal Aggregates Policy, 2009, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, pages 4, iii, and 157. Available at . :\\"It has also been demonstrated that ecologically destructive and inequitable institutional systems can be highly resilient and resistant to change, even in the face of social-ecological degradation and/or collapse (e.g., Berkes & Folke, 2002; Allison & Hobbs, 2004; Brown, 2005; Runnalls, 2008; Finley, 2009; Walker et al., 2009).\\" The thesis focuses specifically on developing ‚Äúan interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability.‚Äù Jack Harich's 2010 paper on Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem argues there are two separate problems to solve.Jack Harich, ‚ÄúChange Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem‚Äù, System Dynamics Review, January 2010. A root cause analysis and a system dynamics model were used to explain how: :\\"...difficult social problems [like sustainability must be decomposed] into two sequential subproblems: (1) How to overcome change resistance and then (2) How to achieve proper coupling. This is the timeless strategy of divide and conquer. By cleaving one big problem into two, the problem becomes an order of magnitude easier to solve, because we can approach the two subproblems differently and much more appropriately. We are no longer unknowingly attempting to solve two very different problems simultaneously.\\" The paper discussed the two subproblems: : \\"Change resistance is the tendency for a system to continue its current behavior, despite the application of force to change that behavior. : \\"Proper coupling occurs when the behavior of one system affects the behavior of other systems in a desirable manner, using the appropriate feedback loops, so the systems work together in harmony in accordance with design objectives. ‚Ä¶ In the environmental sustainability problem the human system has become improperly coupled to the greater system it lives within: the environment. :\\"Change resistance versus proper coupling allows a crucial distinction. Society is aware of the proper practices required to live sustainably and the need to do so. But society has a strong aversion to adopting these practices. As a result, problem solvers have created thousands of effective (and often ingenious) proper practices. But they are stymied in their attempts to have them taken up by enough of the system to solve the problem because an 'implicit system goal' is causing insurmountable change resistance. Therefore systemic change resistance is the crux of the problem and must be solved first.\\" The proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as ‚Äúthe‚Äù problem to solve. It is called decoupling in economic and environmental fields, where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation. Solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular ecological economics: ‚ÄúEcological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded.‚Äù The New Pelgrave Dictionary of Economics Online, abstract. Change resistance is also called barriers to change. Hoffman and Bazerman, in a chapter on ‚ÄúUnderstanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action,‚Äù concluded that:\\"Organizations and the Sustainability Mosaic: Crafting Long-Term Ecological and Societal Solutions\\", Sharma, S. et al., (Ed), 2007. Chapter 4, Hoffman, A. J., and Bazerman, M. H., \\"Changing practice on sustainability: Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action,\\" p85. :\\"In this chapter, we argue that the change in thinking required of the sustainability agenda will never come to fruition within practical domains unless proper attention is given to the sources of individual and social resistance to such change. The implementation of wise management practices cannot be accomplished without a concurrent set of strategies for surmounting these barriers.\\" John Sterman, current leader of the system dynamics school of thought, came to the same conclusion:John Sterman, 2008. \\"Risk Communication on Climate Change: Mental Models and Mass Balance.\\" Science, October 2008, vol. 322, no. 5901, pp 532-533. :\\"The civil rights movement provides a better analogy for the climate challenge. Then, as now, entrenched special interests vigorously opposed change. ‚Ä¶ Of course, we need more research and technical innovation‚Äîmoney and genius are always in short supply. But there is no purely technical solution for climate change. For public policy to be grounded in the hard-won results of climate science, we must now turn our attention to the dynamics of social and political change.\\" These findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved: change resistance and proper coupling. Given the human system's long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode, it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling. This may be expressed as an emerging principle: systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first, before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within, the environment. Systemic versus individual change resistance Systemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance. ‚ÄúSystemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types, as opposed to originating from individual agents.‚Äù Individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations. How the two differ may be seen in this passage:Dent, Eric and Goldberg, Susan. 1999. Challenging Resistance to Change, The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, Vol. 35, No. 1, 25-41. :\\"The notion of resistance to change is credited to Kurt Lewin. His conceptualization of the phrase, however, is very different from today‚Äôs usage. [which treats resistance to change as a psychological concept, where resistance or support of change comes from values, habits, mental models, and so on residing within the individual] For Lewin, resistance to change could occur, but that resistance could be anywhere in the system. As Kotter (1995) found, it is possible for the resistance to be sited within the individual, but it is much more likely to be found elsewhere in the system. :\\"Systems of social roles, with their associated patterns of attitudes, expectations, and behavior norms, share with biological systems the characteristic of homeostasis‚Äîi.e., tendencies to resist change, to restore the previous state after a disturbance. :\\"Lewin had been working on this idea, that the status quo represented an equilibrium between the barriers to change and the forces favoring change, since 1928 as part of his field theory. He believed that some difference in these forces‚Äîweakening of the barriers or strengthening of the driving forces‚Äîwas required to produce the unfreezing that began a change.\\" If sources of systemic change resistance are present, they are the principal cause of individual change resistance. According to the fundamental attribution error it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining, reasoning, inspirational appeals, and so on. This is because:John Sterman, \\"Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, p28. :\\"A fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behavior. However, people have a strong tendency to attribute the behavior of others to dispositional rather than situational factors, that is, to character and especially character flaws rather than the system in which these people are acting. The tendency to blame the person rather than the system is so strong psychologists call it the 'fundamental attribution error.' \\" Peter Senge, a thought leader of systems thinking for the business world, describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an ‚Äúimplicit system goal:‚Äù Peter Senge, The Fifth Discipline, 1990, p88. :\\"In general, balancing loops are more difficult to see than reinforcing loops because it often looks like nothing is happening. There‚Äôs no dramatic growth of sales and marketing expenditures, or nuclear arms, or lily pads. Instead, the balancing process maintains the status quo, even when all participants want change. The feeling, as Lewis Carroll‚Äôs Queen of Hearts put it, of needing ‚Äòall the running you can do to keep in the same place‚Äô is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby. :\\"Leaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes. To the leaders, it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere. In fact, as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout, the resistance is a response by the system, trying to maintain an implicit system goal. Until this goal is recognized, the change effort is doomed to failure.\\" Senge's insight applies to the sustainability problem. Until the ‚Äúimplicit system goal‚Äù causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved, change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be, as Senge argues, ‚Äúdoomed to failure.‚Äù The current focus is on proper coupling Presently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem. For example, the following are all proper coupling solutions. They attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problem's symptoms: * The Kyoto Protocol * The Three Rs of reduce, reuse, recycle * More use of renewable energy * Better pollution control of many kinds * Collective management of common-pool resources * Certification programs to reduce deforestation such as PEFC and FSC * Contour farming to reduce soil erosion * The green revolution * Zero population growth The direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the I=PAT equation where Impact equals Population times Affluence (consumption per person) times Technology (environmental impact per unit of consumption). It is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce. The top environmental organization in the world, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions:UNEP 2010 Annual Report, p8, Available at . :\\"2010 marked the beginning of a period of new, strategic and transformational direction for UNEP as it began implementing its Medium Term Strategy (MTS) for 2010-2013 across six areas: Climate change; Disasters and conflicts; Ecosystem management; Environmental governance; Harmful substances and hazardous waste; Resource efficiency, Sustainable consumption and production.\\" The six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the I=PAT equation. Al Gores' 2006 documentary film An Inconvenient Truth described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it. The film concluded with Gore saying: :\\"Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero. The solutions are in our hands, we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will. But in America, the will to act is a renewable resource.\\" The four solutions Gore mentions are proper coupling practices. There is, however, a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge, when Gore says ‚Äú...we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will.‚Äù The twenty-seven solutions that appear during the film's closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions. The first nine are:An Inconvenient Truth: Closing Credits, available at . * Go to www.climatecrisis.net * You can reduce your carbon emissions. In fact, you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero. * Buy energy efficient appliances & light bulbs. * Change your thermostat (and use clock thermostats) to reduce energy for heating & cooling. * Weatherize your house, increase insulation, get an energy audit. * Recycle. * If you can, buy a hybrid car. * When you can, walk or ride a bicycle. * Where you can, use light rail & mass transit. Some solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance, such as: * Tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in. * If you are a parent, join with your children to save the world they will live in. * Vote for leaders who pledge to solve this crisis. * Write to congress. If they don't listen, run for congress. * Speak up in your community. However none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance. Overcoming systemic change resistance Efforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve. On how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem, Markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance, Panarchy theory and New Institutionalism, and concluded that: :\\"...neither theory devotes significant attention to understanding the dynamics of resilient and resistant but inefficient and/or unproductive institutional and ecological systems. Overall, more research is required....\\" Taking a root cause analysis and system dynamics modeling approach, Harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a root cause and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems. Several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested. The point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes. Once these are found, how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling, the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily. Solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system, which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects. This reaffirms the work of Donella Meadows, as expressed in her classic essay on Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System. The final page stated that: :\\"The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it.\\" Here Meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance. This is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling. However, if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found, the system will not resist changing them. This is an important principle of social system behavior. For example, Harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high \\"deception effectiveness.\\" The source was special interests, particularly large for-profit corporations. The high leverage point was raising \\"general ability to detect manipulative deception.\\" This can be done with a variety of solution elements, such as \\"The Truth Test.\\" This effectively increases truth literacy, just as conventional education raises reading and writing literacy. Few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious. Promotion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems, including environmental sustainability. This solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes. Milton Friedman explained why CSR fails: \\"The social responsibility of business is to increase profits.\\" \\"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits\\", Milton Friedman, September 13, 1970, The New York Times Magazine, available at . Business cannot be responsible to society. It can only be responsible to its shareholders.  References   See also  * The Corporation (film) * WorldChange Model. This adds a change resistance subsystem to the World3 model of Limits to Growth in order to more correctly analyze and simulate why sustainability science has so far been unable to solve the sustainability problem.

The county emblem is an elephant. Eastern Equatoria Government facilities Kapoeta North is part of Greater Kapoeta, and was part of Kapoeta County. After it was split off, in 2006 Kapoeta North County did not have an office building, and the administration was literally operating from under a tree. In March 2011 the United Nations Office for Project Services was inviting bids for construction of a prison complex in Kapoeta North County. In April 2011 the county was hit by a heavy rain and wind storm that caused extensive destruction. The primary and secondary schools, the police station, and about 60 houses were destroyed. Water and health The county had limited water supplies, and after many years of civil war about 40% of the water points were not functioning. As a result, diseases due to drinking unsafe water were common, including guinea worm disease, scabies, eye infections and diarrhoea. The situation has improved with assistance from NGOs and international aid organizations. However, at least 90% of the population still have no access to latrines and instead use the bush. In May 2009 elders and women in Riwoto held a two-day peaceful demonstration after their three boreholes had broken down almost a month before. The acting county commissioner Tito Abbas Lomoro said his office, working with the Carter Center, had commissioned urgent repairs. However, the repair technicians needed money and materials from the state government to do the work. In October 2010 it was reported that the Association for Aid and Relief, Japan had built two Urban Water Systems in Kapoeta North capable of supplying safe drinking water to more than 20,000 people daily. By 2009 there were less than 5,000 cases of dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) in the world, most in Eastern Equatoria state, and there were good prospects of completely eradicating the disease. The Guinea worm case containment center in Kapoeta North, operated by the Southern Sudan Guinea Worm Eradication Program assisted by the Carter Center, plays a central role in achieving this goal. Between January and March 2011 194 cases of dracunculiasis were reported from 93 villages and six counties in South Sudan. Of these, 43 were from Kapoeta North. Miscellaneous In June 2009 the Norwegian Peoples Aid organization donated 66,000 Sudanese Pounds to six farmers groups from the Lomeyan, Lokwamor, Paringa, Najie, Korkomuge and Chumakori payams. The money was to be used to buy seeds and agricultural tools, and to cover other expenses.

History  The present villa dates back to the 15th century, but as far back as the Middle Ages the Cavalcanti, a powerful Florentine Guelph family, owned numerous holdings in the locality of Murlo between the Pesa river and its tributary, the Virginio. The old feudal property was destroyed by the Ghibellines after their victory over the Guelphs at the Battle of Montaperti. What remained of the estate was divided up between various members of the Cavalcanti family, and Lorenzo Cavalcanti undertook the task of reconstruction and improvement, as well as buying back neighbouring land, as recorded in a survey from 1498. Lorenzo's daughter Contessina later married Alessandro Malegonnelle, a prominent courtier, who further enlarged the property. When Contessina was widowed in 1560 the estate was purchased by the wealthy Bongianni Gianfigliazzi (1500‚Äì1568), a diplomat for Florence. The Piante dei Capitani di Parte Guelfa of 1584, now found in the Florentine State Archives, mentions a chapel, testifying to the importance of the house. In 1617 the estate was purchased by Angelo and Francesco Baldocci, who commissioned important construction works including the enlargement of the villa and the chapel. The property was inherited in the 18th century by a nephew, Leonardo Spinelli Baldocci, who died leaving no heirs; thus in 1812 the Villa di Murlo was passed on to Gaetano and Carlo Spinello Spinelli. The two brothers administered considerable assets, including - as well as the Baldocci and Spinelli family estates - those of the Dell'Antella family, owners of the precious Vasari Archives. These were held in a room next to the library on the piano nobile of the villa. When the Spinelli line died out in 1882 the villa passed to Cesare Rasponi Bonanzi (1822‚Äì86), son of Spinella Amata Spinelli and count Gabriello Rasponi Bonanzi of Ravenna. Cesare married his cousin Letizia Rasponi Murat, grand-daughter of Napoleon, whose collection of memorabilia was displayed in a room dedicated to the French emperor. Leone, the last Rasponi count, died in 1952 leaving no direct heirs.  Architectural History  The present structure, commissioned in the early 18th century by the Baldocci family, and was designed by the architect Bernardino Ciurini. Between 1723 and 1740 teams of artists decorated the structure, including the stucco artist, Giovan Martino Portogalli.Portogalli also stuccoed the ballroom in Ciurini's Palazzo Martelli in Florence. Also employed were the Bolognese painters Anton Domenico and Giovan Filippo Giarr√© who executed the frescoed classical landscapes, vedute, in the salons on the ground and first floors. At the south west end, those parts of the villa dating from the 16th century were enlarged, incorporating the old 15th-century workers' house. The handsome main Facade to the north west is in the asymmetrical but austere Baroque classical style, which was the last word in urban taste but rare to find in florentine country houses. The south east facade overlooks a raised terrace with formal Italian garden, that conceal a complex of vast, barrel vault wine cellars. Stone steps lead down from the terrace to gently sloping gardens. Adjacent to the north east end of the villa, completing the picturesque scene, is the late 16th-century chapel. Designed on the classic central plan, it still has visible in the apse a fresco depicting Saint Francis of Assisi receiving the stigmata. Its cupola has a roof of decorative terracotta scales. It would seem from the dedication plaque of Settimia Guadagni Baldocci found in the chapel that the elegant facade was added during the 18th-century enlargement.  Bibliography  *P. Joshua Jacks, W.

Her fiction debut was with \\"The Dream\\" in the July 1940 issue of Unknown, edited by the legendary sf editor John W. Campbell. During the war she published 10 stories in Unknown. Campbell purchased her first and only novel, Lucy, in 1943, and was holding it in inventory for a future issue when Unknown suddenly ceased publication late in 1943. Street & Smith held the manuscript for several years but after the war it vanished from their files, and Rice had failed to preserve a carbon copy. Despite efforts to trace it on the part of scholars and editors it has not been located. Her stories in Unknown were well received. Her slyly sensual werewolf story \\"The Refugee\\" from the October 1943 issue was selected by Campbell for his best of anthology From Unknown Worlds (1946) and it was also anthologized in Rivals of Weird Tales (1990) and the Library of America's American Fantastic Tales: Terror and the Uncanny from the 1940s to Now (2009), edited by Peter Straub. \\"The Idol of the Flies\\" from the June 1942 issue has also been frequently anthologized; it concerns an evil boy named Pruitt who has been called \\"one of the most monstrous children in literature\\". After the war she wrote for the slicks and women's magazines, including Colliers, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan, and Charm. After a hiatus lasting several years she wrote stories for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in the late 1950s, and in 1966 published the story \\"The Loolies Are Here\\", written in collaboration with Ruth Allison under the name Allison Rice in the anthology Orbit 1 (1966), edited by Damon Knight. In the 1980s she resumed writing with a number of atmospheric mystery short stories for Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine. In 1995 Necronomicon Press published her horror novelette The Sixth Dog as a chapbook. She did not live to see the publication of her second book, a collection of her short fiction called The Idol of the Flies and Other Stories, published by Midnight House in 2003 as a limited edition of 500 copies. Personal life Jane Rice was born Jane Theresa Dixon on April 30, 1913, in Owensboro, Kentucky, the daughter of Dr. James Thomas Dixon and Julia C. Lynch. Her father, a physician, died when she was 14, and the following year she was sent to Notre Dame, Indiana to be educated at Saint Mary's College. At St. Mary's she was president of the senior class and editor of the school paper, The Marionette. After graduating in 1930 she attended Webster College in Webster Groves, Missouri, a Catholic women's institution operated by the Sisters of Loretto.\\"'Willapawampus' by Jane Rice, Once of Owensboro, of Much Interest Here\\", The Owensboro Messenger, April 28, 1946, p. 8.

He has served as professor of surgery at the New York Medical College, State University of New York, Cornell University Medical College, and as the chief cardiothoracic surgeon at Saint Vincent Hospital-Manhattan, State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, and New York Hospital Queens. His community services include serving as the president of Chinese American Medical Society, the president of China AIDS Fund (6), vice- chairman of the National Council of Asian Pacific Islander Physicians (7), board director in American Cancer Society-East Asian Unit, Chinese American Cardiovascular Association (8), and Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corporation (9). He was featured as one of the eight most influential Chinese Americans in the ViViD magazine (10) in 2011.  Early life  Dr. Wilson Ko immigrated to San Francisco, California with his family at the age of 12, and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen at the age of 18. He was selected to San Francisco‚Äôs premiere public college preparatory Lowell High School, where he graduated in the top 1% of his class with Scroll Honorary distinction and achieved the highest scores for the advanced placement examinations in biology, chemistry, physics, and calculus. He attended University of California at Berkeley and graduated with distinct honor in biochemistry. This was followed by a medical degree from Chicago Medical School, where he graduated as valedictorian.  Education  Ko underwent one of the most competitive postgraduate training in general surgery for five years under G. Tom Shires, M.D. in the prestigious New York Hospital‚ÄîCornell University Medical. During this training, he spent an additional two and a half years of cardiothoracic surgery research under Karl Krieger, M.D. During this time, he published 32 peer-reviewed scientific papers. He was then selected in an equally competitive and highly sought-after cardiothoracic surgery training program for the next two years also at New York Hospital‚ÄîCornell University Medical Center under the direction of O. Wayne Isom, M.D. Immediately after his surgical training, he was recruited to the Cornell faculty in the department of cardiothoracic surgery. In the ensuing 11 years, he was promoted from assistant to associate professor. He was a founder of a new Cornell satellite heart surgery program at New York Hospital of Queens, where he served as the director from 1999 to 2006. During his 20-year tenure at Cornell, he published over 45 peer-reviewed scientific papers, presented findings in numerous local, national, and international medical conferences, served as a frequent lecturer and visiting professor in addition to have developed a large clinical practice that is one of the busiest (400 to 625 major cases per year) in the New York metropolitan area. In 2006, Ko was recruited to be the professor and chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the State University of New York‚ÄîDownstate University Medical Center in Brooklyn, where he formed and presided a new multidisciplinary team with aims for a center of excellence. During this three-year tenure, he recruited a new team including two cardiothoracic surgeons, chief intensivist, chief physician assistant, chief perfusionist, nurse practitioners, data manager, researcher, and office staff; this team remains intact today. In this challenging institution, Dr. Ko revitalized clinical services, added new surgical programs, improved the training program of fellows, general surgery residents and medical students, and initiated research projects including one that was awarded NIH funding. In his departure, he was given the University President‚Äôs Best Teacher Award by the graduating class of over 1,000 residents, fellows, and students in 2009. In 2009, Ko was recruited to form the new Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery and became its chairman at the St. Vincent Hospital Manhattan, a major teaching affiliate of New York Medical College where he is appointed Professor of Surgery The goal was to build a world-class cardiovascular center with the latest techniques and technology to serve the residents in the five boroughs of New York City. The new department was formed with 3 cardiac surgeons and 2 thoracic surgeons with case volume more than doubling over the first six months. Unfortunately, the hospital went into bankruptcy and closed in April 2010 due to a disastrous financial situation. Currently, he serves as attending cardiothoracic surgeon and the co-director of Asian Cardiac Center at Beth Israel Medical Center. Ko had been a visiting professor in the First Municipal Hospital of Guangzhou (Canton, China) for three consecutive years, where he gave lectures and performed surgeries to demonstrate the modern American techniques in heart surgery. Subsequently, he had received surgeons from that hospital for advance training at New York Hospital of Queens. In August 2009, initial discussion has begun to consider a teaching interchange between St. Vincent Hospital Manhattan and First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College in China to form the first Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery Program in the city of Guangzhou serving 12 million residents. He was active in serving the Chinese American Community in New York in multiple fronts. He served on the board of directors for eight years, and then acted as the treasurer, vice-president, and the president of the Chinese American Medical Society with over 1200 physician members. Through this New York based society, he has contributed to many community services such as health education seminars, regular health related articles in Chinese newspaper, and radio programs, press releases regarding urgent health issues. The society initiated ‚Äúhealthy heart‚Äù food education program for local restaurants, annual free flu vaccination, and financially supported many community based research programs related to hepatitis, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, HIV and others.

History Canyon Road is a long, narrow road that leads to the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. It runs parallel to the Acequia Madre (\\"mother ditch\\"), an irrigation ditch dating back to 1680. Prior to Spanish arrival, the road was a footpath between the Santa Fe River Valley and Pecos Pueblo. Canyon Road was once a primarily residential neighborhood. Houses built in the Pueblo Revival style, in accordance with the local Spanish Colonial and Pueblo methods, were constructed with adobe walls and courtyards, often as compounds for extended family. Artists were drawn to its beauty, particularly the Los Cinco Pintores in the 1920s. Olive Rush (1873‚Äì1966) was a prominent early Canyon Road artist who maintained a studio at 630 Canyon, which she donated to the Society of Friends. It is still a Quaker meeting hall today.

V. Ellsworth. Ellsworthite is also known as the mineral Betafite. Ellsworthite is a - bearing mineral that is found mostly in Canada and Alaska. It was first discovered in Hybla, Ontario, which is now a ghost town. Minerals of the pyrochlore group present one of the most important modes of occurrence of trace elements (Nb,Ta) and were found in various geological (geochemical) environments. It is very important geochemically that the pyrochlore structure is very suitable for diverse isomorphic substitutions.Yaroshevski, A.A., Bagdasarev, Yu.A. (2007).

She was one of America's leading female artists, and one of the few women commissioned under the New Deal's Federal Art Project, which also employed Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning. Life California (42-foot mural, left half), Maxine Albro, 1934, Coit Tower, San Francisco California (mural, right half), Maxine Albro, 1934, Coit Tower, San Francisco Ethel Maxine Albro was born in 1893 in Ayrshire, Iowa, the daughter of Frank Albro,U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1995 a grain buyer1900 United States Federal Census and piano salesman,1910 United States Federal Census and Cordelia Mead.Iowa, Births and Christenings Index, 1800-1999 She had an older brother, Francis, and a younger brother, Harold. She spent part of her youth in Estherville, Iowa. She grew up in Los Angeles. Her father's family came from England and settled in Rhode Island before moving west,Family History and her mother's ancestors were of Irish-English descent. In 1920, she moved to San Francisco where she studied at the California School of Fine Arts from 1923 to 1925. A year later, she enrolled in the Art Students League of New York. In the early 1920s, she lived in Burlingame, California.U.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925 In 1927, she studied at Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris, before embarking to Mexico, where she would study underneath one of Diego Rivera's assistants, and eventually make the acquaintance of Diego Rivera. Albro was one of the few women who were part of the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project, a program initiated under President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Due to the high rate of joblessness during the Great Depression, these art programs were required to employ female artists, making this period the first time in history in which women were hired without discrimination in the United States. Throughout the 1930s, Albro executed many commissions under the federal program, including murals at Coit Tower and a mosaic at San Francisco State University. None of the artists working on the mural had ever actually used mosaic as a medium before, and the WPA had to hire an Italian mosaic setter who had to teach the artists how to create and lay mosaic pieces. In 1931, Albro had a major exhibition in New York City, in accord with the modern Mexican art renaissance that had been fostered in the city's galleries. Her first showing consisted of 30 paintings and 30 drawings, which the Art Digest called \\"a critical as well as a popular triumph.\\" No stranger to controversy, a work of four nudes that Albro painted at the Ebell Women's Club in Los Angeles, titled Portly Roman Sybils, offended the organization's members, and was destroyed in 1935. That year, several prominent art critics, including the young Arthur Miller, rose to her defense. \\"Personally I think they are beautiful decorations which deserve to live and which will be missed,\\" Miller wrote. The San Francisco News of May 25, 1935, printed the following: Also destroyed was her mosaic of animals over the entrance to Anderson Hall at the University of California Extension in San Francisco. On March 28, 1938, Albro married fellow artist Parker Hall in Pima, Arizona.Arizona, County Marriage Records, 1865-1972 They moved to Carmel, California, and together they would return to Mexico numerous times throughout their lives. There, Albro became an assistant to Rivera and studied with Pablo O'Higgins, with whom she painted frescoes. Upon her return to the United States, Albro had several large art commissions. Albro was a member of the American Artists' Congress, California Society of Mural Artists, California Art Club, and the Carmel Art Association. Albro was 73 years old when she died in Los Angeles in 1966. Style Mexico (lithograph), Maxine Albro, 1933, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco Albro's artistic style is described as \\"clean, bright and clear with the strong rounded forms of this era, often depicting the women of Mexico, in particular those of the Tehuantepec region in Oaxaca.\\" Her mural titled California at San Francisco's Coit Tower, which depicts the bounty of California's agricultural industry, was produced under the Works Progress Administration program. In 1934, the Literary Digest wrote about Albro's California, comparing it to the other murals painted inside Coit Tower: Two years earlier, following a successful Albro exhibition in San Francisco, art critic Junius Cravens wrote in the Argonaut: Outside of artwork commissioned for public buildings, Albro painted frescoes for many private homes.  Influences  Albro was most recognized for her frescoes and her characteristic treatment of Mexican and Spanish subject matter. The influence of Mexican art is visible throughout her paintings, murals and lithographs. In an interview two years before her death, Albro said: In particular, Albro was strongly influenced by Diego Rivera. \\"Watching Diego [paint] was very beneficial to me,\\" she said.  Impact  Albro's works can be found in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), National Gallery of Art, National Museum of the American Indian, San Francisco's Coit Tower, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Allied Arts Guild, and in various galleries and private collections. Albro became a leader in the California muralist movement and was one of the first women to achieve such a prominent position. Her work was also highlighted by numerous paintings and lithographs, which are becoming rare and valuable collection pieces. Although she specialized in Spanish and Mexican motifs, she also painted landscapes and street scenes that were inspired by her world travels. The famed photographer Imogen Cunningham took a hauntingly intimate portrait of a shrouded Albro in 1931, adding her to a collection of notable painters that she photographed, which included Frida Kahlo, Miguel Covarrubias, and Lyonel Feininger.

Its network consists of more than 1,600 physicians and 29,000 employees at more than 640 locations, including 15 medical centers and hundreds of outpatient facilities and physician clinics. The organization was formed on 1 July 1997 by the merger of Carolina Medicorp of Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Presbyterian Health Services of Charlotte, North Carolina. Headquartered in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Novant Health serves more than 4 million patients annually. In 2019, Novant Health was ranked #38 in Forbes' annual ranking of America's Best Employers for Diversity, #3 in Diversity MBA Magazine's annual ranking of Best Places to Work for Women & Diverse Managers, and #6 in North Carolina in Forbes' annual ranking of America's Best Employers by State. History Mergers and Re- branding Novant Health announced a new brand in 2013 to bring a unifying business identity to its mix of more than 400 local brands. The new logo color aubergine represented \\"excellence\\" and \\"warmth.\\" Reorganization and Layoffs In July 2015, Novant Health concluded a months-long internal reorganization by terminating approximately 2% of its workforce, or about 400 employees. Despite the layoff announcement, officials said in a statement that the health system was \\"financially healthy\\" and a year-end report showed it generated a profit of $201.8 million the previous fiscal year. This was the largest system-wide layoff incident for the organization since its previous termination of 289 employees in May 2012, which caused picketing and protests associated with the Occupy movement. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital affiliation Novant Health announced a new affiliation with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital on 21 April 2015. The St. Jude affiliate clinic is located in Charlotte, North Carolina . The St. Jude Affiliate Clinic at Novant Health Hemby Children's Hospital provides specialized hematology and oncology care for pediatric patients in North and South Carolina. Novant Health UVA Health System Novant Health UVA Health System was formed 1 January 2016, as a new regional partnership between Novant Health and the University of Virginia Health System. This joint operating company was created through the merger of three regional hospitals: UVA Health System Culpeper Hospital, Novant Health Haymarket Medical Center and Novant Health Prince William Medical Center, as well as additional facilities from Novant Health including assisted living, outpatient cancer care, and ambulatory physician clinics. Comprehensive Stroke Center certifications On 23 June 2017, it was reported that Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center had achieved a Comprehensive Stroke Center designation from the Joint Commission and American Heart Association, the first hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina with the designation and the second within the Novant Health system. Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina was previously designated as a Comprehensive Stroke Center in 2012, and has been re-certified three times. Comprehensive Stroke Center certification recognizes hospitals that meet standards to treat the most complex stroke cases, and is the highest level of stroke certification available.  Trauma Center  In June 2017, Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center received approval from the North Carolina Office of Emergency Medical Services as a \\"practicing Level II trauma center.\\" The hospital was previously designated as a Level III trauma center in 2016. To qualify for the full Level II designation, the hospital must care for 1,200 trauma patients in the year following the practicing designation and be evaluated on physician response times and patient outcomes. As part of its trauma program, Novant Health launched a medical transport helicopter in November 2017 in partnership with the Med-Trans Air Medical Transport network. Novant Health MedFlight, an Airbus Eurocopter EC135, is based at Novant Health Rowan Medical Center in Salisbury, North Carolina and transports patients within a 150 nautical-mile radius.  Inner-market expansion  Novant Health Mint Hill Medical Center opened in October 2018 , the system's first new hospital campus in several years after more than a decade of planning and construction that was slowed down by the 2008 Great Recession. The Mint Hill, North Carolina facility opening was the highest profile example of Novant Health's strategy to expand services within its existing markets after several failed ventures into new markets, including the sale of Gaffney Medical Center in Gaffney, SC in 2014, the closure of Franklin Medical Center in Louisburg, NC in 2015, and the terminated acquisition of Memorial Health in Savannah, GA in 2016. Novant Health has also expanded capacity at its other North Carolina regional facilities including Clemmons, Kernersville, and Huntersville. In 2018 and 2019, Novant Health made several large real estate purchases for future growth including the former Sears store at Hanes Mall in Winston-Salem, NC, a large medical office building in the SouthPark region of Charlotte, NC, and the Hall Family Farm in the Ballantyne area of south Charlotte for a future medical center.  Novant Health Institute of Innovation & Artificial Intelligence (AI)  Novant Health announced the launch of the Novant Health Institute of Innovation & Artificial Intelligence (AI) in June 2019. The institute will \\"focus on the advanced technologies required to provide highly personalized care and accelerated solutions with actionable data and insights for preventative prediction, diagnosis and treatment to Novant Health's patients.\\" Hospitals North Carolina *Novant Health Brunswick Medical Center *Novant Health Charlotte Orthopedic Hospital *Novant Health Clemmons Medical Center *Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center *Novant Health Hemby Children's Hospital *Novant Health Huntersville Medical Center *Novant Health Kernersville Medical Center *Novant Health Matthews Medical Center *Novant Health Medical Park Hospital *Novant Health Mint Hill Medical Center *Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center *Novant Health Rehabilitation Hospital, an affiliate of Encompass Health *Novant Health Rowan Medical Center *Novant Health Thomasville Medical Center *New Hanover Regional Medical Center - Trustees approved of Novant Health, Waiting on final approval from New Hanover County Commissars Virginia (joint operations) *Novant Health UVA Health System Culpeper Medical Center *Novant Health UVA Health System Haymarket Medical Center *Novant Health UVA Health System Prince William Medical Center  Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center  Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center is a 654-bed hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York. After earning a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Brooklyn College, in 1943 he entered the University of Chicago as an Army Air Cadet. He completed his master's degree in 1945, then, following his release from military service as a lieutenant in the United States Army Air Forces, he became a doctoral student in the meteorology department. In 1948 he explored an interest in planetary meteorology, and spent his time at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona observing Mars. His dissertation was titled, Some Aspects of the Meteorology of Mars. On May 20, 1950, Hess had the unusual distinction of reporting a UFO sighting from Flagstaff, saying it was a bright disk cutting through clouds and \\"definitely was not an airplane\\". In 1950, he joined the newly formed meteorology department at Florida State University, where he would spend the remainder of his career and later twice served as the department chairman. Starting in 1966, he was associate dean at the University for several years. He served as head of the meteorology science team for the Viking landers, and helped design the weather instruments for the Viking 1. On July 21, 1976, he made the first ever extraterrestrial weather report, giving the atmospheric conditions at Chryse Planitia, Mars. In 1978, he received the Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professorship, the highest honor awarded by FSU. His work titled Introduction to theoretical meteorology was published in 1959; it was reprinted in 1979. He died from complications following surgery for cancer. In 1983, the Seymour Hess Memorial Symposium was held in his honor by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.

He was editor of The Builder, and author of several works upon practical architectural questions. Writings His writing include 'Specifications for Practical Architecture,‚Äô which is a compilation of forms of documents deemed to be necessary for the execution of detail work in buildings; a paper entitled 'Hints relative to the Construction of Fireproof Dwellings' (Lond. 1839); both of which were well received, though now of little professional value; and a synopsis of the Building Act, first published in The Builder, and revised and corrected for separate publication, under the title of 'Cyclop√¶dia of the New Metropolitan Building Act,‚Äô by the author only a few weeks before his death. During his editorship of The Builder in 1844, Bartholomew also contributed many articles upon various professional subjects to its columns, and under his editorship the circulation of the journal increased. Life Originally destined for commercial life, young Bartholomew received only the moderate education of a middle-class school. But having manifested a decided aptitude for mathematics, his parents articled him to Mr. J. H. Good, architect, of Hatton Garden, a pupil of Sir J. Soane. Bartholomew devoted himself enthusiastically to this profession. He studied the classic style in the greatest of Sir J. Soane's works, the Bank of England, the details of which he used to spend much of his time in measuring. But his master's employment in ecclesiastical work soon diverted him to the more congenial study of Gothic, especially church Gothic, architecture, his enthusiasm for which led to the foundation of a society, of which he was one of the earliest and most ardent members, of ‚ÄòFreemasons of the Church, for the recovery, maintenance, and furtherance of the true principles and practice of architecture.' To the same period of mental development may also be assigned his publication, in 1831, of 'Sacred Lyrics, being an attempt to render the Psalms of David more applicable to parochial psalmody.' Although certainly superior, in freedom and grace of expression at least, to previous versions of the Psalms used in England, and praised as such by various of the bishops in private letters to the author, this attempt did not prove successful, and has now been long ago forgotten. Afterwards the poet devoted himself more exclusively to architecture, and, in the course of the few years that remained to him of life, produced the various works we have named, and earned for himself the respect and esteem of his professional brethren. A few weeks before his death he canvassed successfully for the post of district surveyor of Hornsey. His exertions brought on an attack of rheumatic gout and fever, upon which bronchitis fatally supervened, and he died in his house in Gray's Inn, London, at the age of forty-four.

The Royal family maintained a pure bloodline until a genetic mutation nearly wiped them out and gave rise to a new race of mutants called vampires. They in turn gave rise to new race of half-breeds, causing the pure-blooded vampires to grow wary. The ruler of the Vampires at this time, Lord Vlad, decided that he would eliminate the impurities that threatened the existence of his people and declared war against humans and half-breeds alike. After the Black Plague had swept through Europe in the 14th century, the great witch Philistia assembled the Hermetic Association of the Golden Seal, a unification of small rebel groups to fight against Lord Vlad's vampire army. One of the nations affected by the plague was Rumania. Seeking protection from the plague, the country's royal family sealed themselves within Curtis Castle, but to no avail. Every member of the royal family succumbed to the sickness. The Hermetic Association of the Golden Seal, has tracked their target, the ancient vampire Lord Vlad, to Curtis Castle in Bramunez. Acting quickly, the Golden Seal team placed a powerful barrier upon the castle, sealing Vlad and his minions within. Now they plan their assault on Curtis Castle, to defeat Vlad once and for all. Just as the operation begins, a group of strangers have arrived in the city of Bramunez. Calling themselves \\"Specialists\\", they possess strange and powerful abilities that the Golden Seal team would be foolish to ignore. The strangers are encouraged to join the siege on the castle, but their goals and their pasts remain mysteries; even to each other.

Biography Barr√© was born in Germany about the year 1760 of French Protestant parents, who had left their native country on account of their religious opinions. He served first in the Russian navy, returned to France when the first revolution broke out, went as a volunteer in the army during the Italian campaign of 1796, and was raised to the rank of captain for the bravery he displayed on the field of battle. Through his intimate acquaintance with the principal languages of Europe, he became a favourite of General Bonaparte, who appointed him his personal interpreter. But he wrote some satirical verses about his employer, which seem now to be lost, and was obliged to flee from France. Pursued by Fouch√©'s police-agents, he escaped in a small boat from Paris down the Seine as far as Le Havre, and went thence in an American vessel to England, where he appears to have arrived in 1803. The following year he published in London a History of the French Consulate under Napoleon Buonaparte, being an Authentic Narrative of his Administration, which is so little known in Foreign Countries, including a Sketch of his Life, the whole interspersed with curious anecdotes, &c.;, in which he furiously attacks the first consul. Before this work appeared he had already translated into French Sir Robert Wilson's History of the British Expedition to Egypt, and into English a pamphlet, Answer from M. Meh√©e to M. Garat. In 1805 appeared, in English, Barr√©'s Rise, Progress, Decline, and Fall of Buonaparte's Empire in France, the second part of the former History, which is preceded by an 'advertisement' of ten pages, in which he attacks the reviewers of his first book in the Annual Review and History of Literature for 1803. This second work is, according to Barr√©'s entry in the Dictionary of National Biography, as scurrilous as the first. Barr√© left England for Ireland, where he appears to have had relatives bearing the same name, among them being the well-known orator, Isaac Barr√©. About the year 1806 he printed at Belfast, on a single sheet, some verses in French, called Monologue de l'Empereur Jaune, le nomm√© Napol√©on Buonaparte, Chr√©tien, Ath√©e, Catholique et Musulman, sur la destruction de son digne √©mule et rival l'Empereur Noir, le nomm√© Jacques Dessalines, par la l√©gion d'honneur de l'arm√©e noire de St. Domingue, le 10 Octobre, traduit du Corse, with the motto, '√† ton tour, paillasse'. He seems to have published nothing more, and is said to have committed suicide in Dublin in 1829.

She lived most of her adult life in America, where she was known as Cecil Allen. Allen initially painted landscapes and portraits in her early career, but changed to modernist styles including cubism from the 1930s. In 1927 Allen lectured at New York City venues including the Metropolitan Museum, Columbia University and other institutions. She was sponsored by the Carnegie Corporation. Allen wrote two books of art criticism, The Mirror of the Passing World (1928) and Painters of the Modern Mind (1929), based on her lectures. In 1930 Allen curated the first exhibition of Australian art in New York, \\"First Contemporary All-Australian Art Exhibition\\", at the Roerich Museum. During her lectures and talks in Australia, she helped introduce the ideas of modernism to Melbourne women and artists. After living in New York, from 1949 Allen lived in Provincetown at its art colony. Her cubist style painting, \\"Sea, studio: Winter\\", was presented in that year. She died in 1962, at the colony, from \\"sinus arrest, cause unknown\\" (see sinoatrial arrest). Early life and training Allen was the daughter of Harry Brookes Allen (1854‚Äì1926), a pathologist and medical administrator, and Ada Rosalie Elizabeth, n√©e Mason (1862‚Äì1933), a community worker. She and her sisters, Edith Margaret and Beatrice (Biddy), spent their childhood living in a staff house at the University of Melbourne where their father was an anatomy professor and the Dean of Medicine. Her father was knighted in 1914. Allen qualified to study a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Melbourne, but decided to study under Fred McCubbin at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School instead, entering the faculty of arts in 1910. From 1912 to 1913 Allen studied at the Slade School of Fine Art when she and her family moved to England. She returned to NGV Art School during 1913‚Äì17. Early work: 1920s Allen was a member of Australian Art Association, the Victorian Artists' Society and the Twenty Melbourne Painters during the 1920s and her exhibitions of landscapes and portrait paintings were well received by the Melbourne art world. She was also a member of society, being friends with Ivy Brookes (daughter of Alfred Deakin) and having Dame Nellie Melba and University Vice-Chancellor Sir John Grice open some of her exhibitions. Two of Allen's portraits were finalists in the Archibald Prize in 1921 and a further two were finalists in 1925. During early September 1921 Allen exhibited a set of fifty-four oil paintings at the Fine Art Society's Gallery in Melbourne. In 1925 Allen became the first female art critic for The Sun. She studied under Max Meldrum, a tonal impressionist whose students, Arnold Shore and Jock Frater, had been experimenting with modernism. At this point, Allen was not yet a fan of modernism ‚Äî she criticised Shore's work in The Sun and said that post-impressionists \\"create nothing but monsters‚Äìthey invent the abnormal\\" during one of her lectures. In 1926 she was employed by the National Gallery of Victoria as an art guide and lecturer ‚Äî the first woman to hold this position. In 1926, Florence Gillies, an American tourist, visited Melbourne and invited Allen to be her guide through European galleries, mostly in Paris. Following this, in 1927, Allen lectured at New York City venues including the Metropolitan Museum, Columbia University and other institutions. She ran a series of lectures at the Readers Roundtable of the People's Institute, held at the New York Public Library, where newly created adult classes were taking place and were sponsored by the Carnegie Corporation. From that time, Allen generally lived and worked in New York. According to Marion Scott \\"[Allen] was able to increase one's ability to comprehend visually what had previously been puzzling... She did this by using words with great economy, words which were so lucid that they created no barrier between one's eyes and the work of Art.\\" Modernism: 1930s Following her work and travels in Europe and America, Allen converted to modernism. She wrote two books, The Mirror of the Passing World (1928) and Painters of the Modern Mind (1929) based on her lectures and in the latter book, stated \\"that art should convey ideas, rather than mimic visual reality\\". In 1930 Allen organised the first exhibition of Australian artists in New York, \\"First Contemporary All-Australian Art Exhibition\\", at the Nicholas Roerich Museum, opening in February 1931. Besides her own work, featured artists included Norman Lindsay, Thea Proctor, George Bell and Dora Toovey: and one hundred paintings were shown. The cover of the exhibition catalogue had the Commonwealth coat of arms and a notice of patronage by Prime Minister James Scullin. Herbert Brookes, husband of Allen's friend Ivy, had been the Commissioner General for Australia in the United States from 1929‚Äì1930 and had approved the official stamp on the exhibition catalogue, adding the newly elected prime minister's name as his representative in New York. The exhibition attracted large attendances and interest, and then Allen lectured on the works during its tour. La Revue Moderne, a French modern art journal, profiled her in 1931. The New York Times called her work in the Australian Art exhibition \\"arrestingly modern\\" ‚Äî this was in contrast to the conservative works of other Australian artists. In a later interview with The Advertiser, on 17 June 1936, Allen mentioned all the art work exhibited had non-Australian scenery and had titles such as \\"Landscape in Spain\\" and \\"Bosky Dells in Surrey\\". She elaborated, \\"If I had come upon as much as a single kangaroo I would have hailed it with delight\\". Allen returned to Melbourne in 1935, for eleven months. She spoke with many women's groups whilst in Australia, such as National Council of Women of Victoria and Australian Federation of University Women. Receptions were hosted for her by the Victoria League Club, the Arts and Crafts Society of Victoria, the International Club and the Melbourne Society of Women Painters. At the party hosted for her in October 1935 at the Athenaeum Gallery by the Melbourne Society of Women Painters, she spoke of the differences between female painters in New York and Australia, \\"In New York there is a big gallery specially for women, which has solved a great difficulty.\\" She noted that the history of female painters was sparse: \\"We must look to the future because women in art have no past.\\" Allen's paintings ‚Äî including abstracted depictions of New York skyscrapers and subways ‚Äî were exhibited at the Fine Art Society's Gallery between 20 and 31 August 1935. They \\"aroused a storm of protest\\", according to Frankie Derham, her friend, fellow artist and art educator; \\"with only loyal friends buying pictures, which they later confessed they dare not hang at home\\". Despite the controversy ‚Äî the distortion in the works was considered a lack of realism and \\"loss in skill\\" ‚Äî the exhibition was a success, and conversation piece, drawing crowds until its closure. Allen introduced the American tradition of the weekend sketching school to students in Melbourne. She also lectured at the Bell-Shore School on the invitation of Arnold Shore, The Argus art critic, who had been a fellow student. She spoke about balance, colour harmony, equal attention to positive and negative space ‚Äî \\"the air should be as positive as a cube of ice\\" ‚Äî and encouraged a cubist approach, as it \\"is the only way in which to grasp the essential forms of nature.\\" When analysing the function of the grotesque in modern art, Allen wrote in 1930, \\"All that is strange and incredible and non-existent is its subject matter. It takes what is not and what might be and creates with them and opposes this new imaginative world to the positive world of naturalism and science.\\" Provincetown Art Colony: 1950s From 1949 Allen lived and worked in Provincetown at its art colony. Her cubist style painting, \\"Sea, studio: Winter\\" was painted in that year at the colony. It was shown at Georges Gallery in Melbourne in following year. In June 1950 Allen travelled to Alice Springs to \\"capture something of the strange character and beauty of central Australia for an exhibition when she returns next month to New York.\\" From this trip she wrote \\"Notes on Central Australia\\" for Meanjin, the Australian literary magazine, in Spring 1950. Her final visit to Australia was from November 1959 to April 1960, to lecture and exhibit. The Ages art critic wrote, \\"[Allen]'s capabilities are most apparent when she is occupied with the rearrangement of planes and forms, and their disposition as a pictorial unity... This ability is illustrated by the near- abstract compositions [including] 'Sea, studio...' [in which] the suggestion of space in design is admirable\\".  Death and legacy  Mary Cecil Allen died on 7 April 1962, she was found dead in her chair by neighbours, due to \\"sinus arrest, cause unknown\\" (see sinoatrial arrest). She was buried at the Provincetown Cemetery, according to Anglican rites. Eight of Allen's paintings are held by the National Gallery of Victoria. Her papers are held at the Archives of American Art. Sacrifice, a wax crayon work, was sold at Christie's (London), in November 1991, for USD1,096. Her landscape, Sorento Hotel, was sold at auction in May 2001, in Melbourne, for US$7,274. In 1963 the Art Teachers Association of Victoria established the Mary Cecil Allen Memorial Lecture delivered annually, where an international speaker alternated with an Australian speaker over successive years. In July 1966 L. M. Haynes, professor of industrial arts at the University of Sydney delivered \\"Creativity in Art and Science\\" for that year's lecture.

Life Battine was born at East Morden, Sussex on 25 January 1765. Through his mother's family, he was stated to be one of the coheirs of the long dormant barony of Bray, but he never publicly urged his claim. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1774, but migrated to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he appears to have obtained a fellowship at a precociously early age; he took the degree of LL.B. in 1780, and that of LL.D. in 1785. On 3 November 1785, he was admitted fellow of the College of Doctors of Law, in London, and soon secured a large practice in the ecclesiastical and admiralty courts. From the year 1812 until 1827 he was one of the gentlemen of the privy chamber in ordinary. He is said to have lived on intimate terms with the king when Prince of Wales, and was credited with having settled a quarrel between the prince and his father. For many years Battine was advocate-general in the high court of admiralty, and chancellor of the diocese of Lincoln; he held besides several other minor legal offices. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 1 June 1797. In his old age he contracted many eccentric habits, and, having squandered the wealth he had acquired in his profession, lived in great poverty. He died 5 September 1836, and was, according to his own directions, buried five days later with great privacy in the church of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Battine published, in 1822, a dramatic poem, entitled ‚ÄòAnother Cain: a Mystery.‚Äô It was written, its author tells us, ‚Äòto correct the blasphemy put into the mouth of Lucifer‚Äô in Lord Byron's ‚ÄòCain.‚Äô An undated ‚ÄòLetter to the Judges of the King's Bench,‚Äô in pamphlet form, was also published by Battine. It urges that gentlemen of the privy chamber are exempt by privilege from arrest in civil suits, an indignity to which Battine had himself apparently been subjected.

He had been a bishop since 1981, serving as an auxiliary bishop in St. Petersburg and then as Bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee from 1983 to 1990 and as Bishop of Palm Beach from 1990 until his resignation. Biography Symons was born in Champion Township, Michigan, on October 14, 1932. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of St. Augustine in Florida on May 18, 1958. In 1971, Symons became chancellor of the St. Petersburg Diocese. Pope John Paul II named him the Titular Bishop of Sigus and the Auxiliary Bishop of St. Petersburg in Florida by Pope John Paul II on January 16, 1981. He was consecrated by Bishop William Thomas Larkin of St. Petersburg on March 19, 1981. Archbishops Edward Anthony McCarthy of Miami and Thomas Joseph McDonough of Louisville were the co- consecrators. Symons was transferred to the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee on October 4, 1981, and installed as the second bishop of the diocese on November 8, 1983. He was then transferred to the Diocese of Palm Beach, Florida, on June 12, 1990, and installed as the second bishop of that diocese on July 31, 1990. In 1991, Symons authorized the filming of the rite of exorcism performed by the Rev. James J. LeBar and other priests on a 16-year- old girl identified only as \\"Gina\\". The footage of the exorcism was then publicly broadcast on ABC's 20/20 TV program. Symons explained that he hoped that the broadcasting would help \\"counteract diabolical activities around us.\\" In 1996, a husband and wife charged that years earlier Symons had ignored their report that a St. Petersburg priest had abused their children and tried to bribe them by offering to pay for therapy for their sons. He said he had the priest submit to a psychiatric evaluation. In April 1998, a man in his 50s informed a priest and the Archbishop of Miami, John C. Favalora, that Symons had sexually abused him decades earlier. Symons admitted he had abused five boys early in his career. Pope John Paul accepted his resignation as bishop of Palm Beach on June 2, 1998, and named Bishop Robert N. Lynch of St. Petersburg as Apostolic Administrator of Palm Beach.

He saw service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, particularly during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799 and the Peninsular War. Early life Barton was the fifth son of William Barton of the Grove, County Tipperary, Ireland, and Grace Massy, daughter of Charles Massy, Dean of Limerick. Being in the south of France in 1790, he, like other British there, enrolled himself as a volunteer in the national guard, and received the thanks of the National Convention for his conduct at Moissac during the disorders at Montauban. He was the younger brother of Thomas Barton, M.P.. Army career Having returned to England he obtained a commission in the 11th Light Dragoons, with which he served under the Duke of York in 1795, and again during the Anglo- Russian invasion of Holland in 1799, where he received the thanks of Sir Ralph Abercromby for his services on 8 September at Oude Carspel. Barton used his money to support boxers from Ireland although he was a supporter of Britain. He became lieutenant-colonel in the 2nd Life Guards in 1805, and commanded the regiment at the time of the Burdett riots in 1810, when the life guards acquired so much unpopularity. He also commanded the two squadrons of the regiment subsequently sent to the Iberian peninsula during the Peninsular War, where he served for a time. He was promoted to general's rank in 1819, and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order and Knight Bachelor in 1837. Personal life Barton married firstly to Maria Painter, daughter of John Painter. They had a son, Hugh, and two daughters, Grace and Maria.

History Originally, the Gateway Corridor was planned to follow Interstate 94 from the St. Croix River Bridge in Wisconsin to Saint Paul and is one of the most heavily used and traveled corridors in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. As a result of recent population growth, the Gateway Corridor today moves more than 150,000 vehicles per day. In 2009, a commission was created to study and plan alternative transportation options in the corridor. In August 2010, the Gateway Corridor Commission and its consultant team initiated a Transit Alternatives Analysis Study (AA), looking at the corridor from the Twin Cities to Eau Claire, Wisconsin. This is the first step in determining the best mode (i.e. light rail, commuter rail or bus rapid transit); estimated ridership, possible routes and stops, and projected costs to build, operate and maintain. In looking at these four main areas, the study will help to address the issues of congestion, potential economic development/revitalization and environmental and social impacts. The AA Study will take approximately 18 months to complete and is expected to be finished by spring 2012. Final decisions regarding the mode of transit and route will be determined by the Metropolitan Council and Ramsey and Washington County Regional Railroad Authorities. These decisions will help move this from a planning effort into a real, tangible project. The Gateway Corridor Commission has dropped the commuter rail option, leaving only possible bus rapid transit or light rail routes. All of the bus rapid transit route options would run on Interstate 94. Bus Rapid Transit A proposed bus rapid transit line running from Downtown Saint Paul to Woodbury, named the Gold Line, is proposed to be built by 2024.

Retrieved 2 August 2011 Unlike Aquarius, which was written mainly on the piano by Richard Henshall, Visions was mostly written on the guitar. As with the debut album, the members recorded their parts at home and then shared the files between them. The album features a string quartet and a French horn player mixed with synthetic string and brass sections. Both string and French horn arrangements were arranged by keyboardist Diego Tejeida and drummer Ray Hearne. It is a concept album like its predecessor, telling the story of \\"a young boy who sees his own death in his dreams and believes it's going to happen and spends the rest of his life trying to avoid it.\\" The long closing track \\"Visions\\" is the end of the story but it makes it come full circle to the beginning. The track was written by vocalist Ross Jennings based on a premonition of his own death and it was the first song to be written, with the album growing around it. Like Aquarius, the album artwork was also created by Dennis Sibeijn. The album is dedicated to the mother of guitarist Charlie Griffiths, who had died in 2011. The song \\"Visions\\" contains a voice at the beginning reciting Segismundo's reflection from Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca's play Life is a Dream. Track listing Reception Visions received high praise from Sea of Tranquility webzine. It was described as \\"a staggeringly brilliant example of progressive metal\\" by Pete Pardo and \\"probably the final progressive masterpiece of 2011\\" by Murat Batmaz.

Life Barwell was born Louisa Mary Bacon in the parish of St. Peter Mancroft, Norwich, on 4 March 1800. She was the daughter of Richard Mackenzie Bacon by his wife Jane Louisa (Noverre), born 1768, died 1808. At the age of eighteen she was associated with her father in the editorship of the Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review. A talented musician with a fine voice, she played from score at sight. After her marriage with John Barwell, wine merchant at Norwich (born 1798, died 1876), she devoted attention to educational works, developing a comprehension of child nature, physical and mental. She contributed to the Quarterly Journal of Education from about the year 1831, anticipating later views and plans of education. Her husband, who shared her interest in this subject, was largely instrumental in securing the success of a scheme by which a charity day-school for girls at Norwich was converted into an industrial training-school for girls. With Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg, in whose school at Hofwyl near Berne their sons were placed, the Barwells formed a close friendship. In the literary society of Norwich, as portrayed by Harriet Martineau, Mrs. Barwell held an important place. Her closest friend was Lady Noel Byron, whose correspondence with her was constant, and whose papers she arranged, in the later years of Lady Byron's life.

The tip of the frond rolls upwards into a loose, obvious knot or mop-head structure involving many pinnae; inside, a white larva mines along the rachis, eating the trichomes, causing it to coil. Usually, only one larva is present in the leaf tip, sometimes two.

He also performed a considerable amount of philanthropic work, benefiting his home city of Dundee and more widely Scottish education. Early life Baxter was the second son of William Baxter, of Balgavies, Angus, and was born in Dundee on 15 February 1793. He was educated at the Dundee Academy. Business career 3,4,5 Moray Place While still a young man, he became manager of the Dundee Sugar Refining Company. The concern was never prosperous, and notwithstanding his prudent and energetic management it collapsed in 1826. Thereupon he became partner in the linen manufacturing firm of Baxter brothers, which included his father William and his two younger brothers. William had begun business with a mill in Glamis and in 1822 had started business in Dundee with his eldest son Edward, who left the company in 1825 to commence the business of a general merchant. From the time that David Baxter joined the firm he was practically its head, and on the death of his two brothers and his father within a few years afterwards he and the former manager of the works Peter Carmichael remained the sole partners. They were later joined by William Ogilvie Dalgleish, who was married to David Baxter's niece. In 1828 an attempt had been made by him to introduce power-loom weaving, but after a short trial it was abandoned until 1836, when its revival was followed by complete and extraordinary success. Through the mechanical skill of his partner Peter Carmichael in perfecting the machinery, and the business capacity and tact of David Baxter, the firm speedily became one of the largest manufacturing houses in the world; and to its remarkable success may be in a large degree ascribed the position which Dundee attained as the chief seat of the linen manufacture in Britain in the nineteenth century. Sir David Baxter was also a partner in Turnbull & Co, later Boase & Co, which operated a bleachfield at Claverhouse, and was later fully taken over by Baxter Brothers. Public affairs and philanthropy Although much immersed in the cares of business, Baxter took an active, if not very prominent, share in public affairs. In 1825 he was chosen a police commissioner, and in 1828 a guild councillor and member of the harbour board. A liberal in politics, he took a lively interest in parliamentary elections, both in Dundee and in the county of Fife, where in 1856 he purchased the estate of Kilmaron. His enlightened regard for the welfare of his native town was, however, manifested chiefly in noble and generous benefactions which have given his name one of the highest places of honour in its annals. The most notable of these was perhaps his presentation, along with his sisters, of thirty-seven acres of land to Dundee as a pleasure garden and recreation ground, which, under the name of the Baxter Park, was opened by Earl Russell in September 1863. A ¬£20,000 bequest on his death in 1872 led to the foundation of a mechanics' institute in 1888. Known then as the Dundee Technical Institute, it was the fore-runner of Abertay University. The foundation of the Albert Institute of Literature, Science, and Art (now the McManus Galleries) was due also chiefly to his liberality and that of his relatives; and in connection with Dundee Royal Infirmary he erected a convalescent home at Broughty Ferry at a cost of ¬£30,000. More important than his benefactions to Dundee were his gifts in behalf of higher education in Scotland. Besides building and endowing at Cupar, Fife a seminary for the education of young ladies, he established several important foundations in the University of Edinburgh, including scholarships in mathematics, philosophy, physical science, and natural science, each of the annual value of ¬£60; and a chair of engineering, with an endowment of ¬£5,000, which was supplemented by an annual parliamentary vote of ¬£200. On 24 January 1863 he was created a baronet 'of Kilmaron in the County of Fife'. Soon thereafter he acquired 5 Moray Place, a huge Georgian townhouse on the Moray Estate in western Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1879 Death and legacies He died 13 October 1872. Of Baxter's heritable and personal property, valued at ¬£1,200,000, one half was divided among near relatives, and the other among distant relations and public institutions, the largest legacies being ¬£50,000 to the Free Church of Scotland, ¬£40,000 to the University of Edinburgh, and ¬£20,000 towards the foundation of a mechanics' institute in Dundee, later Abertay University. cites The Times, 20 December 1884. Before his last illness Baxter's attention was occupied with a scheme for linking Dundee with the neighbouring University of St Andrews, and although he did not survive to carry out his plans, his relatives helped found University College, Dundee. Towards the purchase of buildings and general equipment of this college one of his sisters Mary Ann Baxter who died unmarried on 19 December 1884, contributed ¬£150,000. cites The Times, 20 December 1884. Family In 1833 Baxter married to Elizabeth (1801-1882), daughter of R. Montgomerie, of Barrahill, Ayrshire. She survived him, and they had two children. She was buried with him in the old churchyard in the centre of Cupar in Fife, just west of the church. Sir David Baxter, family lineage is traced (TGN Services, LLC and its parent Ancestry.com Operations Inc) to the MacBaxter Family that immigrated from Perth Scotland to South Africa (1900s) and is survived by Mark James Baxter 5th Baronet (1977 - ) and Duncan David Baxter (1983 - ) Esq.

He served, mainly in staff roles, during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. However, he is best known for serving as one of the principal staff officers in British North America during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States of America. Early career He entered the army as an Ensign in 1783. During his early military career, he served mainly in the West Indies, including a spell as commander of a detachment of troops serving as marines aboard a frigate. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1790. Craig's aide-de-camp Between 1794 and 1806 he served as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General Sir James Craig, whose duties as military commander and colonial administrator took him to the Cape of Good Hope, Bengal, the East Indies, Gibraltar, Malta, Naples and Sicily. Baynes was promoted to the substantive rank of captain in 1795, to brevet major in 1796, to the substantive rank of major in 1800 and to brevet lieutenant colonel in 1802. Baynes returned briefly to England in 1806. In August, he was appointed adjutant general to the forces in British North America. He was also appointed commanding officer of the Nova Scotia Fencibles. As adjutant general, Baynes was once more associated with General Sir James Craig, who was governor general until 1811. War of 1812 Baynes was promoted to brevet colonel in 1811. As war with the United States threatened, he was appointed commander of the Glengarry Light Infantry, a new unit being raised on the authority of Sir George Pr√©vost, Craig's replacement as governor general. Baynes exerted himself to recruit men to the new unit and to clothe and equip them. He wrote to Pr√©vost on 20 May 1812, \\"...I have purchased all the green cloth in this place (Quebec) and have commissioned a sufficient quantity to equip the regiment to render it efficient for immediate service. I have, of course, subjected myself to many bad debts. If I am not appointed colonel, I am half ruined.\\" Baynes was indeed appointed as the new regiment's colonel, though he did not lead it in the field. Before and during the War of 1812, Baynes was responsible for communicating Pr√©vost's strategy and orders to the commanders in the field. In July 1812, Pr√©vost was notified that the British Government had revoked some of the orders in council which the Americans had cited as one of the causes of the war. Baynes went to Albany, New York, under a flag of truce to negotiate an armistice with Major General Henry Dearborn, commanding the United States' armies in the north. Dearborn agreed to local armistices while the United States government considered Pr√©vost's approach. However, the government were in no mood to negotiate and fighting resumed. During a visit to Kingston in Upper Canada in May 1813, Pr√©vost and Commodore Sir James Lucas Yeo, commanding the British naval units on Lake Ontario, became aware that there was an opportunity to capture and destroy Sackets Harbor, New York. The American ships and Dearborn's army were based there, but both were absent at the western end of the lake. The available British troops were hastily embarked aboard Yeo's squadron. On 26 July, light winds and a scare caused by the sighting of unknown sails, which might have been the American squadron returning, caused the landing to be postponed. When it resumed on 28 July, Pr√©vost delegated command of the troops to Baynes. The British troops successfully landed near Sackets Harbor and put American militia and volunteers to flight, but were unable to dislodge American regulars from buildings at the edge of the town and dockyards. Baynes recommended to Pr√©vost that they withdraw. Pr√©vost concurred, but the repulse damaged his and Baynes's reputations.Hitsman, p.146 On 1 May 1814, Baynes was once again sent to negotiate an armistice as an extension of a prisoner exchange. At Champlain, New York, Brigadier General William Henry Winder claimed to have no authority to agree to any pact, and the British government subsequently disavowed the negotiations.Hitsman, p,200 Large numbers of British troops were arriving in Canada. In June, Pr√©vost secured Baynes's promotion to major general. This was resented by many of the recently arrived British commanders, who had seen far more fighting in the Peninsular War than Baynes had experienced during his career. Baynes was Adjutant General of the division which Pr√©vost led in an invasion of New York State in September 1814. The British turned back after their ships were defeated in the Battle of Lake Champlain, making it impossible for the British to secure their lines of communication. Most of the British commanders considered that Pr√©vost and his staff (including Baynes) had planned and executed the operation badly.Hitsman, p.255 Later life After the War of 1812 ended, Baynes returned to England in 1816. He was largely unknown in the British Army, which had large numbers of veteran officers of the Peninsular War, and remained on half pay until his death, in Sidmouth, in 1829.

Beadon, third son of the Rev. Edward Beadon, rector of North Stoneham, was born in London on 6 December 1777. Early life & education He was educated at Charterhouse and at Trinity College, Oxford. He took orders in 1801, and was shortly afterwards presented by his uncle, Richard Beadon, Bishop of Bath and Wells, to the living of Weston-super-Mare. He exchanged this benefice for the vicarage of Titley, and, in 1811, was presented to the rectory of North Stoneham in succession to his father. He held the prebend of Compton Bishop from 26 May 1809 until his death seventy years later. In 1812 he was made a canon residentiary of Wells, and kept residence there each year, without interruption, until 1875. He was also chancellor of Wells cathedral from 1825 till his death. Family & personal life In 1803 he married Marianne, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Wilder, of Purley Hall, by whom he had one son and two daughters. Canon Beadon came of a family distinguished for its longevity. He was of middle stature, of strongly built frame, and of great muscular power, which he retained even in extreme old age. There was nothing particular in his diet or habits, save that he ate pastry and fruit more freely than meat. He drank wine in moderation. His temper was equable and cheerful. Shooting, fishing, and gardening were his favourite pursuits. He took out a shooting-license as late as 1872, and when engaged in sport seemed almost incapable of fatigue. At the same time he was never unmindful of his calling, and fulfilled its duties diligently, taking some part in the public service of the church up to his 96th year. Work & politics During his residences at Wells he was active in capitular business, especially in promoting the repair of the cathedral church and the efficiency of its services. He took no part in ecclesiastical conflicts, and adhered to the practices and opinions prevalent among the clergy in his early years. He was the last of the non-resident freemen of Southampton whose privileges were reserved by the Reform Bill. In political as well as in ecclesiastical matters he was a strict conservative. Once only, in 1828, does it seem that he travelled in Europe, and he was never thoroughly reconciled to the innovation of railways. On his attaining his 100th year, Queen Victoria caused a message conveying congratulations and good wishes to be telegraphed to him, and shortly afterwards sent him her photograph with her autograph signature. To most of the letters which he received on this occasion Canon Beadon sent immediate replies, written in his own hand. Death In the autumn of 1878 he had a severe attack of bronchitis, and from that time was confined to his room. He continued, however, to take a lively interest in the management of his farm, and in hearing of the success of younger sportsmen. During the early part of 1879 he gradually lost strength, and died very quietly on 10 June of that year, aged 101.

It was created in the Industrial Revolution but since the demolition of the mills is now a residential village. History John and Robert Lord opened a cotton mill using water power from the Dean Brook which powered spinning mules invented by Samuel Crompton. The brothers built 13 cottages near the mill for workers. In 1830 Thomas Bazley and Richard Gardner bought and demolished the mill, replacing it with Dean Mills, twin six-storey steam powered mills situated on the east side of the brook at the entrance to the village. They created a model village for the mill workers on the hill top accessed by a flight of stone steps, with rows of cottages, a shop and an educational institute. Houses for the managers were built a short distance away, overlooking the brook. William Callender bought Dean Mill in 1861. The company went out of business after his death and the mill was demolished in 1913. Benjamin Disraeli visited the village in 1840, it is the basis of the fictional village Millbank in his novel, Coningsby, published in 1844. Govenance Historically, the Barrow Bridge area was part of the township of Halliwell in the ancient parish of Deane. When the south-eastern part of the township became part of the Municipal Borough of Bolton in 1877 the remaining north-western area, including Barrow Bridge, became known as Halliwell Higher End until 1894 when its name was changed to Smithills.

Life Entwistle was the second son of William Entwisle and his wife, Ellen Makin, who were members of a presbyterian church in Manchester, and was born there on 15 April 1767, one of five sons who grew up to manhood. He was taught at the free school connected with the old presbyterian chapel in Manchester. At the age of fourteen Entwisle joined the Methodists, and made use of a good library at the preacher's house in Oldham Street. When not quite sixteen he began to preach, and was known as ‚Äòthe boy preacher.‚Äô John Wesley called him out to the itinerant work, and in 1787 sent him to the Oxfordshire circuit. Four years after, at the Manchester conference, he was received into the full ministry while stationed in Halifax. During the next few years Entwisle laboured in Leeds, Wakefield, Hull, Macclesfield, Manchester, Liverpool, and London, winning apopularity by his preaching power. He was in 1805 appointed the first missionary secretary. The conference of 1812 was held in Leeds, and Entwisle was elected president. Henceforward he filled a leading place in the connexion, and did much to mould its policy and guide its affairs. The later years of Entwisle's ministry were spent in Bristol, Birmingham, Sheffield, and London, where he was several times reappointed. In 1825 he was elected president of the conference a second time. He ceased to itinerate in 1834, being appointed house governor of the new Theological Institution opened at Hoxton for the education and training of young ministers.

Journeying with the first European explorers to these islands in the Far East, they came with the intention of establishing Catholicism under the Patronato real of the Kings of Spain. After the conquistadores brought the Filipinos under the rule of the Spanish crown, either by peaceful means of treaties and pacts or, alternatively, by war, Spain did not send large standing armies to maintain its empire in the East. The apostolic zeal of the missionaries followed the efforts of men such as Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, and aided to consolidate the enterprise of Hispanizing the Philippines. The Spanish missionaries acted as de facto conquerors; they gained the goodwill of the islanders, presented Spanish culture positively, and in so doing won approximately 2 million converts.Tomas de Comyn, State of the Philippine Islands in 1820, William Walton, trans., London: 1821, p. 209. Commenting on the very small standing army that protected the Spanish government in the Philippines, an old viceroy of New Spain was quoted: \\"En cada fraile ten√≠a el Rey en Filipinas un capitan general y un ejercito entero (In each friar in the Philippines the King had a captain general and a whole army\\").Par J. Mallat, Les Philippines, histoire, geographie, moeurs, agriculture, industrie et commerce des Colonies espagnoles dans l'oceanie, Paris: 1846, p. 389. French historian Par J. Mallat made a similar observation. He stated: \\"C'est par la seule influence de la religion que l'on a conquis les Philippines, et cette influence pourra seule les conserver (\\"It is only by the influence of religion that the Philippines was conquered. Only this influence could keep these [islands]\\").Par J. Mallat, Les Philippines, histoire, geographie, moeurs, agriculture, industrie et commerce des Colonies espagnoles dans l'oceanie, Paris: 1846, p. 40. Role of the Friars in Hispanicized Parts of the Philippines Because of the scarcity of Spanish officials in the Philippines, most often the friar was the only Spaniard in a town. Aside from his religious activities, the friar also had authority in administration of the colony. He supervised the election of the gobernadorcillo and cabeza. He was the keeper of the list of residents of the town. His signature had to be seen on all financial papers of the town. The friars also served as mediators who quelled insurrections. It was because of the friar's spiritual function that people believed and feared him. He was also influential because of his knowledge of the native language and his ordinarily long stay in a town.Philippine Civilization History and Government by Celestina Boncan et.al published by Vibal Publishing House p.114 References Category:Captaincy General of the Philippines l,k ","title":"Friars in Spanish Philippines"},{"id":"32565509","text":"Bahria College may refer to: *Bahria College Islamabad, college in Islamabad, Pakistan *Bahria College Karachi, college in NORE 1, Karachi, Pakistan *Bahria College Karsaz, college in Karsaz, Karachi, Pakistan ","title":"Bahria College"},{"id":"32565562","text":"John Paul Strain signs one of his paintings in Franklin, TN.

The final took place on 26 January 1992 at the North Arm Speedway in Adelaide, South Australia. The championship was won by Mildura's Leigh Adams who won the first of his record 10 national championships. Shane Parker from Adelaide was second (and the only rider who defeated Adams on the night) with Queensland's Mark Carlson in third place. Jason Lyons, also from Mildura defeated former champion Glenn Doyle and Queensland's Tony Langdon in a run- off for fourth place to grab the last Australian qualifying spot in the 1992 Commonwealth Final in England. Leigh Adams became the first rider to complete the Australian Championship 'treble' having already won the Australian Under-16 Championship in 1986 and the Australian Under-21 Championship in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1992. He also became the first rider to win the Under-21 and senior championships in the same season, a feat not repeated until Chris Holder from Sydney did so in 2008. Adams would go on to win the 1992 Under-21 Speedway World Championship later in the year in Germany During Heat 3 of the meeting, Todd Wiltshire from New South Wales, who had placed 3rd in the 1990 World Final in England, fell in the second last turn after a race long battle for the lead with Victorian Jason Lyons. As Lyons dived under him for the lead, Wiltshire fell and along with his bike crashed into the safety fence, suffering terrible back injuries and multiple fractures of the Pelvis. Thankfully his Spinal Cord was not damaged, however the injuries were bad enough that the 23-year-old Wiltshire decided to retire from racing, though he would make a comeback to the sport in 1997. Wiltshire's place for the rest of the meeting was then given to the reserves, local riders Steve Greatz and Paul Chevy. 1992 Australian Solo Championship * Australian Championship * 26 January 1992 * Adelaide, South Australia - North Arm Speedway * Attendance - 6,000 (capacity) * Referee: Sam Bass * Qualification: The top four riders go through to the Commonwealth Final in England. {class=wikitable !width=25px|Pos. ||width=200px|Rider ||width=40px|Points ||width=70px|Details |-align=center |Gold ||align=leftLeigh Adams () ||14 |(3,2,3,3,3) |-align=center |Silver ||align=leftShane Parker () ||13 |(2,3,3,3,2) |-align=center |Bronze ||align=leftMark Carlson () ||11 |(2,2,2,2,3) |-align=center |4 ||align=leftJason Lyons () ||10+3 |(3,0,3,2,2+3) |-align=center |5 ||align=leftGlenn Doyle () ||10+2 |(3,3,1,2,1+2) |-align=center |6 ||align=leftTony Langdon () ||10+1 |(1,2,1,3,3+1) |-align=center |7 ||align=leftCraig Hodgson () ||8 |(3,1,t,1,3) |-align=center |8 ||align=leftCraig Boyce () ||8 |(2,3,2,0,1) |-align=center |9 ||align=leftMick Poole () ||8 |(1,3,1,1,2) |-align=center |10 ||align=leftDavid Cheshire () ||7 |(1,1,3,2,0) |-align=center |11 ||align=leftRod Colquhoun () ||6 |(0,1,0,3,2) |-align=center |12 ||align=leftTroy Butler () ||6 |(0,2,2,1,1) |-align=center |13 ||align=leftMichael Carter () ||5 |(2,0,2,1,0) |-align=center |14 ||align=leftGlen Baxter () ||2 |(1,0,0,0,1) |-align=center |15 ||align=leftSteve Greatz () (Res) ||1 |(-,1,0,-,0) |-align=center |16 ||align=leftPaul Schevienen () (Res) ||1 |(-,-,1,0,-) |-align=center |17 ||align=leftKelvin Willis () ||0 |(0,0,0,0,0) |-align=center |18 ||align=leftTodd Wiltshire () ||0 |(f,-,-,-,-) |} Classification References See also * Australia national speedway team * Sport in Australia Category:Speedway in Australia Australia Individual Speedway Championship ","title":"1992 Australian Individual Speedway Championship"},{"id":"32565591","text":"Andrew Simon Barnard (born 3 July 1957) is a former English cricketer.

In December 2008, he protested a Bureau of Land Management oil and gas lease auction of 116 parcels of public land in Utah's redrock country by successfully bidding on 14 parcels of land (totaling 22,500 acres) for $1.8 million with no intent to pay for them. DeChristopher was removed from the auction by federal agents and taken into custody, eventually serving 21 months in prison. Saying they had been rushed into auction with insufficient environmental and scientific review, the United States Department of the Interior canceled many of the leases shortly after the auction and a subsequent court injunction. Early life DeChristopher was born on November 18, 1981, in West Milford, West Virginia and grew up in Pittsburgh. After graduating from Shady Side Academy, he attended Arizona State University, and moved to Utah in 2005 where he worked as a wilderness guide for troubled and at-risk youth. As a guide, DeChristopher emphasized self-reliance skills and respect for the natural world. His interaction with at-risk youth groups led him to reject what he viewed as a political and economic system that concentrates wealth in the hands of a privileged few while ostracizing vulnerable and impoverished citizens in the U.S. This conviction later inspired him to study economics at the University of Utah, where he received a bachelor's degree in 2009. Activism As an avid reader, DeChristopher developed an interest in the writers and philosophies that have shaped U.S. and global social movements. His perspective on the American environmental movement highlights the critical role that civil disobedience has played in social movements throughout history, including the civil rights and women's suffrage movements. DeChristopher's acts of civil disobedience have been compared to those of Rosa Parks by the media, but DeChristopher has said that his actions are more comparable to those of Alice Paul, who escalated the women's rights movement by forcing the government to publicly arrest women protesting on the steps of the capitol and lending visibility to an obscured social movement. DeChristopher's actions garnered national attention for later government auctions of public land leases in the final days of the Bush administration. In January 2009, Judge Ricardo Urbina of the District of Columbia federal district court temporarily halted the sale of 77 parcels, citing BLM violations of environmental laws protecting air quality and historic preservation. In February 2009, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar shelved 77 disputed lease parcels ‚Äì including some on which DeChristopher had bid in 2008 ‚Äî and criticized Bush administrators for conducting a \\"rush review\\" of the contested lands. DeChristopher has expressed the need for similar tactics to end mountaintop removal mining in his home state of West Virginia. In 2013, he and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning, and DeChristopher spoke in the University of Vermont's Ira Allen Chapel. In a 2014 climate change protest on Wall Street, DeChristopher expressed his view that \\"[b]eing serious about tackling the climate crisis means we have to be willing to confront corporate capitalism and the system that is driving that crisis.\\" Trial In a 2009 indictment DeChristopher was charged with two felonies: violations of the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act and making false statements. He faced a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. DeChristopher's defense team sought to rely on a necessity defense, which required proof that DeChristopher was forced to choose between two evils and that his actions resulted in the lesser of the two to avoid imminent harm where no legal alternative was available. U.S. District Judge Dee Benson prohibited the defense, precluding any evidence that might have supported it. The court also barred evidence that the lease auction was deemed unlawful, that DeChristopher had raised sufficient funds for an initial payment to the BLM (which the BLM refused to accept), or that DeChristopher's motives were grounded in moral convictions related to climate change. Prosecutor John W. Huber told the media that DeChristopher was looking for \\"a prominent venue for his global-warming show ‚Äî a platform from which he could educate the masses,\\" and asserted that DeChristopher had overlooked legal methods of protest. DeChristopher responded in court to the assertion that he could have filed written protests against certain parcels: > [T]wo months prior to this auction, . . . a congressional report . . . by > the House committee on public lands[] stated that it had become common > practice for the BLM to take volunteers from the oil and gas industry to > process those permits. The oil industry was paying people specifically to > volunteer for the industry that was supposed to be regulating it, and it was > to those industry staff that I would have been appealing. DeChristopher also tried to rely on a selective prosecution defense, citing \\"political machinations\\" behind the indictment and requesting information from federal prosecutors on instances in which individuals or companies reneged on bids for public land but were not prosecuted. Judge Benson denied that request as well. DeChristopher was convicted on both felony counts. Sentencing DeChristopher entering Frank E. Moss United States Courthouse, July 26, 2011 Protesters from Peaceful Uprising at Tim DeChristopher's sentencing, July 26, 2011 In his pre-sentencing statement, DeChristopher said: > [The prosecutor] wrote that 'The rule of law is the bedrock of our civilized > society, not acts of \\"civil disobedience\\" committed in the name of the cause > of the day'. That's an especially ironic statement when he is representing > the United States of America, a place where the rule of law was created > through acts of civil disobedience. Since those bedrock acts of civil > disobedience by our founding fathers, the rule of law in this country has > continued to grow closer to our shared higher moral code through the civil > disobedience that drew attention to legalized injustice. The U.S. Attorney's office had also argued that \\"a federal prison term here will deter others from entering a path of criminal behavior.\\" DeChristopher responded: Judge Benson imposed a sentence of two years in prison and a $10,000 fine, saying that were it not for his \\"continuing trail of statements\\" post-auction, DeChristopher might have avoided prosecution and prison. According to the judge, \\"The offense itself, with all apologies to people actually in the auction itself, wasn't that bad.\\" The sentencing was followed by protests in Salt Lake City, where 26 people were arrested, and other U.S. cities. Incarceration DeChristopher was initially held at Federal Correctional Institution, Herlong and was later transferred to Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood. According to a Peaceful Uprising press release, in March 2012 DeChristopher was moved from a minimum security camp to a restrictive \\"special housing unit\\" because an email he sent to a friend contained the word \\"threaten,\\" triggering an alert from the inmate correspondence monitoring system. DeChristopher was released on April 21, 2013, a day before Earth Day.\\"Earth Day Exclusive: Tim DeChristopher Speaks Out After 21 Months in Prison for Disrupting Oil Bid\\" Democracy Now.

They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper () and Albrecht D√ºrer the Elder (), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The D√ºrer family was close, and D√ºrer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parentsThausing (2003), 45 or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other,Campbell Hutchison (2000), 186 or diptych wings. However, this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of D√ºrer's most exact and honest portraits.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 14 They are among four paintings or drawings D√ºrer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them are evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait‚Äîlong considered lost‚Äîwas reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum's 2012 exhibition \\"The Early D√ºrer\\". Sources and influences The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piety and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. D√ºrer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden.Brion, 17, 45. Brion (1960) describes D√ºrer's early \\"excessive devotion\\" to van der Weyden as delaying his \\"inauguration [of] a new era in German painting\\". That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \\"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\\".Panofsky, Erwin, 1943; quoted in Brion, 17 Self- Portrait at Twenty-Eight, 1500. Alte Pinakothek, Munich D√ºrer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccol√≤ Albergati.Hunter (1993), 207‚Äì218 believes the portrait of D√ºrer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \\"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\\". Von Fircks notes that D√ºrer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \\"accurate observation and documentary recording\\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although D√ºrer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally. The self-portraits tend to be idealised and the 1500 portrait was his last. Later self-portraits are far more understated and executed in a 'secondary' media, such as his drawings of the Man of Sorrows and nude drawing of 1505, which depicted an emaciated body during the time of the plague. Description Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons D√ºrer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 10 The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered.Bartl (1999), 26‚Äì31 Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 5‚Äì18 The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other.Price (2003), 22 Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that D√ºrer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later. Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Kemperdick (2013), 95 Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to be the first of the two to be executed and, if so, is the earliest extant example of his son's painting. In contrast, a number of art historians have noted that his mother's portrait contains bland passages, especially around the eyes and may be a near-contemporary copy of a lost original.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 5 Lotte Brand Philip believes the clumsiness in the mother panel indicated that D√ºrer painted it first, as a youthful attempt at portraiture, and that Albrecht the Elder might have later \\"commissioned\\" his own portrait to pair with Barbara's.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 17 Recent technical examination of the two panels confirms that Barbara's portrait was painted later than her husband's.Kemperdick (2013), 95 Barbara Holper Barbara Holper was the daughter of Hieronymus Holper, under whom Albrecht the Elder served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith.Brion (1960), 16 The two men became friends, and when she came of age Holper gave his daughter into marriage when D√ºrer senior was 40 and she was 15. The couple were compatible, well-matched and fond of each other. Yet their son's writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks; three of their 18 children survived into adulthood ‚Äì 17 of whom had been born by the time of this portrait.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 11 After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son.Kemperdick (2013), 94 After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote \\"This my pious Mother ... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. Also she died hard ... I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it.\\"Sturge Moore (1905), 71 Detail of Barbara's portrait Barbara is shown wearing a red dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, indicating her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, the bridge of her nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been \\"comely and of erect bearing\\".Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 12 However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress. Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63, March 1514. Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin. This drawing was completed two months before she died The panel closely resembles D√ºrer's 1514 drawing Portrait of the artist's mother at the age of 63.Tatlock (2010), 116 David Price writes of the drawing's \\"rough depiction of her flesh emaciated by old age\\", and the \\"existential piety in the cast of Barbara D√ºrer's right eye, which, almost unnaturally, directs her vision heavenward\\". Although Barbara is some 25 years older in the later drawing and by then terminally ill, the facial resemblance and pose are unmistakable. However, there is a dramatic difference between the relatively young looking 39-year-old woman in the diptych and the aged and terminally ill widow in the 1514 drawing. A family resemblance can be detected between both works and D√ºrer's Vienna self-portrait; most evidently around the mouth. Kemperdick concludes that these passages are so closely modeled that it is reasonable to presume they were drawn by the same hand, but is conservative in saying definitively that the sitters were related by blood, as D√ºrer was very young, and though precociously talented, to some extent still reliant on facial \\"types\\". Albrecht D√ºrer the Elder D√ºrer's father wears a dark shirt, russet coat and a black hat lined with fur. His skin is slack at the mouth and chin, and he has small, intelligent eyes, which Von Fircks describes as \\"dark and serious\\". Their curves echo those of the heavy lids beneath.Von Fircks (2011), 419 His eyes are lined with crow's feet and shadowed with brown hatched paint. His facial features are built from brush strokes more typical of drawing than painting‚Äîat this young age D√ºrer was a far more skilled draughtsman than painter. Technical analysis carried out in 2013 by Dagmar Hirschfelder revealed a detailed background which was over-painted by the artist.Sander (2013), 18 The abandoned interior space consisted of a corner of a room with an arched window looking out to a countryside view. This type of interior can be traced to the Netherlandish tradition, and is rare in German portraiture of the period.Kemperdick (2013), 98 Albrecht the Elder's lips are thin and tightly pursed and his mouth is broad and down-turned, yet his features are those of a handsome man. Marcel Brion described him as appearing \\"mild and thoughtful\\", an impression reinforced by the uncomplicated design of the painting.Brion (1960), 20 This view is reinforced by the relative drabness or simplicity of his clothes, which seem intended to convey a reserved, ascetic piousness. D√ºrer presents his father more like a low-ranking ecclesiastic than a tradesman: a calm, considerate and straightforward man dressed up in his best, albeit modest, clothes.Brion (1960), 19 After his father's death in 1502, D√ºrer wrote that Albrecht the Elder \\"passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself, his wife and his children ... He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him ... he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man.\\"Sturge Moore (1905), 36 Martin Conway describes the portrayal of a dignified man marked by a grave expression and deep \\"furrows ploughed by seventy years of labour and sorrow\\".Conway (1889), 35 Conway believed the strength of the portrait is in part achieved through D√ºrer's ability to convey this hardship, while at the same time presenting a man still imbued with traces of pride, and possessing \\"a kind old face\\". Noting the obvious affection between the father and son as well as the half smile of the older man, he wonders if that grin might have been born of Albrecht the Elder's satisfaction that his toil has been rewarded by a son of such talent, who was now about to set out on the world for his wanderjahr. A contributing factor to this pride is that Albrecht the Elder trained his son in his own profession, as a jeweller, but at one point came to regret the choice of apprenticeship as the younger man was so obviously suited to drawing and painting. However, his son learned many skills during that period and it gave him a discipline with his hands that became a defining factor of his work, especially in his ability as an engraver.Conway (1889), 36 Portrait of D√ºrer's Father at 70, 1497. Oil on lime panel, National Gallery, London Conway described the panel as indicating \\"an astonishing depth of psychological insight\\" for an artist not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, D√ºrer's mature work. He portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait D√ºrer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face.Mills (1991), 747 According to Brion, his eyes have lost their \\"distant, mystic\\" appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man. The panels Each canvas is mounted on two boards of equal width, which have been cut vertically and appear have come from the same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490‚Äì92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether D√ºrer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown. The father panel is signed and dated on both sides, in what may be the oldest extant instance of D√ºrer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d.Allen (2005), 21 However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions.Conway (1918), 142Kemperdick (2013), 99 The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed D√ºrer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring. The reverse of Albrecht's panel contains a rendition of the allied D√ºrer and Holper families' coats of arms,Campbell Hutchison (2002), 238 which are shown beneath a winged Moor wearing a red dress.Thausing (2003), 46 The D√ºrer family are represented by a crest showing an open door, a pun on the word D√ºrer (Th√ºrer meaning 'doormaker'). Albrecht the Elder was born in the Hungarian village of Ajt√≥. Ajtos is Hungarian for \\"door\\"‚Äîwhen his parents moved to Germany their name changed from T√ºr to D√ºre.Bailey (1995), 36 The Holper crest features a stag, but its significance is lost.Allen (2005), 22 The back of Barbara's panel contains imagery of a dragon in a lightning storm set against a rocky landscape or cliff.\\"Albrecht D√ºrer, Barbara D√ºrer, geb. Holper (recto) \\" (in German). Germanisches Nationalmuseum. Retrieved 31 October 2013. Provenance and attribution After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of D√ºrer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573 to 1574, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after a mention in the 1633‚Äì58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown.Campbell Hutchison (2000), 209 D√ºrer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the D√ºrer oeuvre\\".Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 7 Detail showing the monogram In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme, and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and D√ºrer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background.Campbell Hutchison (1990), 26 Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and D√ºrer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\". Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria. Hans Hieronymus Imhoff's lukewarm description of Barbara's portrait‚Äî\\"the mother of Albrecht D√ºrer in oil colors on wood, [but] there are many who do not believe it to be a work of D√ºrer\\"‚Äîled Brand Philip to conclude that Albrecht's panel was likely sold individually as the more accomplished and marketable of the two.Brand Philip & Anzelewsky (1978‚Äì79), 6 The attribution is widely accepted today. In 2013 Stephan Kemperdick noted the sophistication of the Nuremberg portrait and that its three-dimensional modeling of the head displays a level of skill beyond Wolgemut and his circle. The two panels were reunited in 2012 during a D√ºrer exhibition in Nuremberg having been separated since sometime between 1588 and 1628. References Notes Citations Sources * Allen, L. Jessie.

Claimable injuries might result from events such as a motor vehicular collision or other negligent action, and cause impairments, disorders, and disabilities perhaps as an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition (e.g., Drogin, Dattilio, Sadoff, & Gutheil, 2011;Drogin, E.

New York: Springer Science + Business Media. . 2007Young, G., Kane, A. W., & Nicholson, K. (2007). Causality of psychological injury: Presenting evidence in court. New York: Springer Science + Business Media. .). Legally, psychological injury is considered a mental harm, suffering, damage, impairment, or dysfunction caused to a person as a direct result of some action or failure to act by some individual. The psychological injury must reach a degree of disturbance of the pre-existing psychological/ psychiatric state such that it interferes in some significant way with the individual's ability to function. If so, an individual may be able to sue for compensation/ damages. Typically, a psychological injury may involve posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), a concussion, chronic pain, or a disorder that involves mood or emotions (such as depression, anxiety, fear, or phobia, and adjustment disorder). These disorders may manifest separately or in combination (co-morbidity). If the symptoms and effects persist, the injured person may become a complainant or plaintiff who initiates legal action aimed at obtaining compensation against whomever is considered responsible for the injury. Scope In the following, psychological injury is discussed in relation to the law, forensic psychology, assessment, malingering, diagnosis, treatment, PTSD, chronic pain, TBI, disability, return to work, psychological tests and testing, and causality. Psychological injury and law Research and practice in the scientific field of psychological injury are predictably and intimately associated with legal research and practice. For example, workers in the field need to know evidence law, tort law, and insurance law, both at the national and local (state, provincial) levels in their countries of practice. This association between psychological injury and law began to be recognized as a distinct scholarly and professional entity in the first decade of this century,Young, G. (2008a). Psychological injury and law: Introduction to the first issue. Psychological Injury and Law, 1, 7-10. in particular, as the result of the development of the first scientific society, the Association for the Scientific Advancement of Psychological Injury and Law (ASAPIL), and the first peer-reviewed academic journal devoted exclusively to the topic, Psychological Injury and Law. This type of case is quite adversarial, because psychological injury is associated with court, and because complainants might exaggerate or even feign symptoms outright. Psychologists and other mental health professionals must be well trained in legal matters, knowledgeable regarding forensic psychology, and qualified to conduct appropriate diagnostic and other assessment procedures (Boone, 2007;Boone, K. B. (Ed.). (2007). Assessment of feigned cognitive impairment: A neuropsychological perspective. New York: Guilford Press. . Larrabee, 2007).Larrabee, G. J. (Ed.). (2007). Assessment of malingered neuropsychological deficits. New York: Oxford University Press. . Also, see various professional guidelines, such as American Psychological Association, 2002,American Psychological Association (2002). Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct. American Psychologist, 57, 1060-1073. Committee on the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, 2011;Committee on the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, R. Otto, Chair (March 18, 2011). Specialty guidelines for forensic psychology (6th Draft). and Pope and Vasquez, 2011.Pope, K., & Vasquez, M. (2011). Ethics in psychotherapy and counseling: A practical guide. New York: Wiley. . When mental health professionals fail to undertake comprehensive, impartial, and scientifically informed assessments, they risk challenges to the admissibility of the evidence that they present to court and having it dismissed as poor or \\"junk science.\\" The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993)Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993). provided a basis for determining acceptable science in court, and required judges to function as \\"gatekeepers\\" for evaluating the probative or helpful value of the testimony for the case at hand. Two additional, related U.S. Supreme Court cases‚ÄîGeneral Electric Co. v. Joiner (1997)General Electric Company et al. vs. Joiner et ux., 522 U. S. 136 (1997). and Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael (1999)-Kumho Tire Company v. Carmichael, 119 S. Ct, 1167 (1999). may be added to comprise what is often referenced as the \\"Daubert trilogy.\\" These decisions have been incorporated into Federal Rules of Evidence 702.H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 115th Cong., Fed. R. Evid. at 15 (Comm. Print 2017).28 U.S.C. app. at 399‚Äì402, Fed. R. Evid. 702, Comm. Notes on Rules‚Äî2000 Amendment (2018). A Canadian case that addresses many of the same issues is R. v. Mohan (1994).R v Mohan (1994). 2 S.C. R. 9, 1994 CanLII 80 (S.C.C.). Some U.S. jurisdictions follow the Frye standard to determine admissibility of expert witness testimony.Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013, 34 ALR 145 (D. C. Cir 1923). Note that psychological injury, as presently defined, is treated in court uniquely in civil cases. In this sense, although the area of psychological injury and law is related to forensic psychology, it does not relate to the criminal component of this area. Matters important to forensic psychology, such as adopting the correct procedures in practice, being an expert witness, and understanding the relationship of psychology and court, are also essential to practice in the area of psychological injury and law. Assessment and malingering Psychologists are trained and expected to be comprehensive, scientific, and impartial in conducting their assessments (Heilbrun, Grisso, & Goldstein, 2009Heilbrun, K., Grisso, T., & Goldstein, A. M. (2009). Foundations of forensic mental health assessment. New York: Oxford University Press. .). Such assessments involve (a) interviewing (of the person being assessed, and perhaps involving family, work, and professionals), (b) document review (e.g., other reports; about school, work), and (c) psychological testing. The tests they use either directly assess‚Äîor include scales that assess‚Äîvarious signs of psychological injuries, and many are sensitive to malingering (conscious fabrication of symptoms for monetary or other personal gain, or symptom feigning, though this is not very common) and other response biases (Rogers, 2008Rogers, R. (Ed.). (2008). Clinical assessment of malingering and deception (3rd ed.). New York: Guilford Press. .). For example, rather than engaging in malingering, a complainant might be exaggerating excessively, or catastrophizing, out of an unconscious \\"cry for help\\" for not having been \\"heard\\" in prior assessments or for having her pains and other symptoms continue to limit her life activities. The validity of the complainant's presentation, whether physical or psychological, needs to be determined by comprehensive assessments that can help discern threats to validity such as these. Psychologists should not arrive at facile conclusions either way along these lines. They must resist the pressure of the adversarial divide and the referral source, as well as other sources of undue influences on their professional judgment, in order to arrive at unbiased conclusions (see Berry and Nelson, 2011Berry, D. T. R., & Nelson, N. W. (Eds.). (2011). Special issue: Malingering: Special Topic (Part 1). Psychological Injury and Law, 4.). Diagnosis and treatment Psychologists and psychiatrists are those professionals typically qualified by their regulating or licensing bodies or boards to diagnose and treat psychological injuries. Psychologists are trained in the study of behavior and its assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Many psychological tests are limited in their use to psychologists, as psychiatrists are unlikely receive substantial training in test administration and interpretation. However, being medical professionals, psychiatrists have skills and a knowledge base not typically available to psychologists. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‚Äînow in its fourth edition (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association, 2000American Psychiatric Association (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: Text revision (4th ed). Washington, DC: Author. .)‚Äîwill soon be updated by a fifth edition slated for publication in 2013 (see Young and First, 2010,Young, G., & First, M. B. (Eds.). (2010). Special issue: The DSM-5 draft: Implications for psychological injury and law. Psychological Injury and Law, 3. for a critique). This Manual is prepared under the aegis of the American Psychiatric Association, but psychologists contribute to this process by participating in its working groups. Rehabilitation and other clinical psychologists‚Äîsuch as trauma psychologists‚Äîmay be in professional contact with injured survivors at the onset injury, shortly thereafter, and throughout the course of recovery, such that these professionals, too, need to know about the legal ramifications of the field. They may employ cognitive behavioral approaches to help their patients deal with any physical injuries, pain experience, PTSD, mood, and effects of their brain injuries (Young, 2008bYoung, G. (2008b). Psychotherapy for psychological injury: A biopsychosocial and forensic perspective. Psychological Injury and Law, 1, 287-310.). They may assist the families of the injured, including spouses and children. They typically adopt a systems approach, working as part of rehabilitative teams. Their hardest cases occur when there is a death in the family as a result of the event for which legal action is involved and therapy is needed. These clinical, rehabilitation, and trauma psychologists refer to treatment guidelines in preparing their treatment plans, and attempt to keep their practices evidence-based when feasible. Major psychological injuries Posttraumatic stress disorder The field of psychological injury is beset by controversies. In this regard, the three major diagnoses in the DSM‚ÄìIV-TR most central to this area are often criticized for their definition, validity, and usefulness in court, and for their ease in feigning or malingering without detection. For example, PTSD is diagnosed based on 17 major symptoms (e.g., flashbacks, startling, nightmares, fears), but these often are placed on attorneys' websites under clear headings such as, \\"Do you have these symptoms of PTSD?\\", with the result that plaintiffs can be coached all the easier in how to present with this disorder. Moreover, the diagnosis may be given inappropriately to individuals based upon the slightest of traumatic events, even though it was meant originally for quite severe ones. There has been an explosion in cases involving the diagnosis of PTSD, and even in the military the diagnosis may be given too easily without careful assessment. In cases of valid presentation of PTSD, psychologists can help patients deal with their condition by applying specialized cognitive behavioral techniques, such as systematic desensitization and exposure therapy (see Frueh and Wessely, 2010Frueh, B. C., & Wessely, S. (Eds.). (2010). Special issue: Posttraumatic stress disorder. Psychological Injury and Law, 3.). Chronic pain Chronic pain is another controversial psychological condition, labeled in the DSM-IV- TR as Pain Disorder Associated with Psychological Factors (with or without a Medical Condition). The \\"biopsychosocial approach\\" recognizes the influence of psychological factors (e.g., stress) on pain. It was once thought that chronic pain could be the result of a \\"pain-prone personality\\" or that it is \\"all in the head.\\" Contemporary research tends to dismiss such conceptualizations, but they continue persist and cause distress to patients whose pain is not recognized as real. Psychologists have an important role to play in helping patients in pain by providing appropriate education and treatment (for example, about catastrophizing or fearing the worst), and by using standard cognitive and behavioral techniques (such as breathing exercises, muscle relaxation, and dealing with cognitive distortions) (see Gatchel, Peng, Fuchs, Peters, and Turk, 2007;Gatchel, R. J., Peng, Y. B., Fuchs, P. N., Peters, M. L., & Turk, D. C. (2007). The biopsychosocial approach to chronic pain: Scientific advances and future directions. Psychological Bulletin, 133, 581-624. Schatman and Gatchel, 2010Schatman, M. E., & Gatchel, R. J. (Eds.). (2010). Special issue on traumatically induced pain. Psychology Injury and Law, 3.). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) TBI refers to mild to severe pathophysiological effects in the brain and central nervous system due to strong impacts, such as severe blows to the head and penetrating wounds that might take place in accidents and other events at claim. Neuropsychological deficits associated with TBI include those relating to memory, concentration, attention, processing speed, reasoning, problem solving, planning, and inhibitory control. When these effects persist, other psychological difficulties might arise, even in mild cases (such as concussions). However, the underlying reason for the perpetuation of the symptoms beyond the expected time frame might be due to associated factors, such as poor sleep, fatigue, pain, headaches, and distress. Psychologists can help patients with TBI by guiding them in cognitive remediation and dealing with family. When the effects are serious and even devastating, the degree of care from the team may be intensive, covering multiple aspects of daily living (see Ruff and Richards, 2009Ruff, R., & Richards, P. M. (Eds.). (2009). Special issue on traumatic brain injury. Psychological Injury and Law, 3.). People of both sexes and all types of backgrounds, races, ages, and disability status are injured physically and psychologically in events at claim and in other situations. However, the research does not always consider these differences, and often the diagnostic manuals, psychological tests, and therapeutic protocols in use in the area also lack differentiation along these lines. Disability and return to work When psychological injuries compromise daily activities, psychologists need to address the degree of disability (see Schultz, 2009;Schultz, I. Z. (Eds.). (2009). Special issue: Disability and return to work. Psychological Injury and Law, 2. Schultz & Rogers, 2011Schultz, I. Z., & Rogers, E. S. (Eds.). (2011). Work accommodation and retention in mental health. New York: Springer Science + Business Media. .). Patients express symptoms that might be accurately diagnosed as PTSD, Pain Disorder, and/or TBI. However, the critical issue is the degree of impairment, limitation, and participation restriction in daily activities in which patients would normally participate at work, at home, in childcare, and in schooling. When the patient cannot undertake the functions involved in these important roles, the psychologist or other mental health professional may conclude that a disability is present, but this cannot be ascertained by the mere presence of a diagnosis of one sort or another. Rather, the psychologist must demonstrate that the person is disabled from the essential duties, tasks, or activities of the role at issue. For example, a forefinger injury leading to chronic pain might mean relatively little to an investment banker‚Äîas long as medications control it and other areas of functioning are not greatly affected‚Äîbut might be devastating to a violinist. Psychologists may refer to the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (Rondinelli, Genovese, Katz, Mayer, M√ºller, Ranavaya, & Brigham, 2008Rondinelli, R. D., Genovese, E., Katz, R. T., Mayer, T. G., M√ºller, K. L., Ranavaya, M. I., & Brigham, C, R. (2008). Guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment (6th ed.) Chicago: American Medical Association. .) in arriving at disability determinations, which addresses mental health, neuropsychological, and pain issues. However, like the DSM-IV-TR, this compendium is sometimes questioned for its scientific validity and usefulness. Tort actions and other civil actions are often based on serious, permanent and important psychological injuries that create disabilities of a substantial nature in other areas, such as leisure activities, home care, and family life. Often, psychologists in court lock horns over the degree to which the event at claim and its psychological effects have created serious and potentially permanent psychological disabilities‚Äîin part, because there is no one test that can measure \\"disability,\\" per se. Treating psychologists try to help clients return to work (RTW) or to their other functional roles and activities of daily living (ADLs). Clients are expected to adhere to treatment regimens, or be compliant with treatment recommendations. Partly, this serves to mitigate their losses, or attempt to return to their pre-event physical and psychological condition. When they reach or are progressing to their maximum medical recovery (physical and psychological/ psychiatric recovery), RTW might be attempted on a modified, part-time, or accommodated basis, and treatment might continue to help full re-integration into the workforce or other daily roles, and to maintain gains and avoid deterioration. Or, clients might be sent for training or education, based on their transferable skills residual to the event at claim and its effects. For those who do not make full recovery and remain disabled because of their permanent barriers to recovery, the goals of rehabilitation include optimizing adjustment, quality of life (QOL), residual functionality, and wellness. Psychological testing Psychologists need to use the most appropriate tests available for detecting feigning, malingering, and related response biases. In addition, psychologists need to be able to arrive at scientifically-informed conclusions in their evaluations that will withstand the rigors of scrutiny by psychologists on the opposing side and of cross-examination in court. In terms of their education and training, psychologists need to be able to address the full array of areas under discussion, especially in forensic, rehabilitation, and trauma areas. They must become experts in assessment and testing, especially regarding (a) personality tests (e.g., the MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989;Butcher, J. N., Dahlstrom, W.

The key factors in the development of tests that are acceptable to psychologists and to court is that the tests should have acceptable psychometric properties, such as reliability and validity. Also, such tests must be standardized by using populations that make sense for the area of psychological injuries, such as accident survivors experiencing pain and other trauma victims. Causality Another aspect important for psychologists to consider is the degree of influence of mental health conditions already present prior to the event at claim. Just as one might have a pre-existing back injury that a whiplash injury in an accident did not make worse, it could be that pre-existing psychological disorders were not worsened by the effects of an event at claim, no matter how traumatic. Therefore, in some cases‚Äîsuch as those involving a serious pre-existing schizophrenia or brain damage‚Äîit is possible that the event that had occurred did not actually exacerbate what had existed prior to the event at issue, or make things any worse. In other cases, by contrast, the person might have pre-existing psychological or psychiatric vulnerabilities, or relatively mild psychological or psychiatric conditions, and the event at issue brought to the surface the vulnerabilities or made the pre-existing conditions clearly worse. These are sometimes labeled \\"thin skull\\" or \\"egg-shell psyche\\" cases, and are the most intriguing and difficult to manage because of the potential \\"gray zones\\" in their causal interpretation (Young, 2008cYoung, G. (2008c). Psychological injury and law: An integrative model. Psychological Injury and Law, 1, 150-160.). Extraneous stresses, such as job loss due to worksite bankruptcy, might also complicate causal determination. Ultimately, the mental health professional considers the full range of pre-event, event, and post-events factors in apportioning or deciding upon causality. Note that \\"litigation distress\\" refers to one source of stress for complainants or litigants; it concerns iatrogenic or stressful factors in the insurance and legal process that add to their stresses and complicate their recovery and psychologists' understanding of the causality behind their injuries. Indeed, their injuries have been referred to as a result of \\"compensation neurosis;\\" however, there is little evidence to support this claim. For example, their injuries generally do not magically heal after they receive their financial settlements. Value of the field and validity of the injuries Psychological injury and law is a discipline that stands at the intersection of forensic psychology, rehabilitation psychology, trauma psychology, and the law. It is at times controversial, but is constantly being researched and refined. Practitioners must remain abreast of related scientific, regulatory, and ethical developments or risk being challenged in court for the admissibility of their evidence, and even exposing themselves to malpractice claims for negligence. Psychological injuries remain contested disorders and conditions, especially because of their association with court and related venues. However, psychologists and other mental health professionals who use state-of- the-art knowledge and procedures can help ascertain when they are valid.

Accessed 2011-07-15. He enlisted in the United States Coast Guard and entered the service in 1943. His first post was as an anti-submarine warfare instructor. From April 1944 to 1946, he was the anti-submarine warfare officer on the USS Peterson, an Edsall class destroyer escort serving convoy duty in the North Atlantic. On April 15, Truesdale's first day aboard ship, the Peterson and two other destroyer escorts engaged and sank a German submarine, the U-550. Truesdale enrolled in September 1946 at the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University.Toner, p. 207-208. He graduated with an M.S. in industrial and labor relations in May 1948. Cornell University had the only school of industrial relations at the time, and each year NLRB staff traveled to the school to hire qualified staff. One of Truesdale's professors had his entire class take the NLRB exam, and Truesdale scored well on it. The Board offered Truesdale a job, and he was hired by the Buffalo field office as a field examiner in 1948. For several months after his appointment, he rented a room from fellow labor lawyer and friend Richard Lipsitz Sr.Lipsitz later defended numerous labor leaders before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations during Senator Joseph McCarthy's anticommunist hearings in the 1950s. He also defended many people before hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s and 1960s. He also represented civil servants accused of violating the McCarran Internal Security Act and educators accused of violating New York state's anticommunist loyalty test laws (known as the \\"Feinberg law\\"). He was the winning counsel in Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967), which overturned the law. See: Williams, Fred O. \\"Labor of Love: Richard Lipsitz, Sr., Has Been Labor's Advocate for More Than 50 Years.\\" Buffalo News. May 7, 2003. Early NLRB career Truesdale proved to be a highly regarded field examiner. The NLRB offered to transfer him to more highly sought-after posts in other field offices over the next three years, but he declined each time. But believing that another refusal might hurt his career, he accepted a transfer to New Orleans in 1951. There he met Karin Nelson, a field examiner and labor economist from the San Francisco office who was on temporary assignment.Toner, p. 208. Truesdale moved to Washington, D.C., in 1952, where he was appointed an administrative analyst for the Board. He wed Karin Nelson in 1957. Truesdale left the NLRB in 1957 after being appointed Deputy Director of the National Academy of Sciences. From July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958, he served as Director of Information for the International Geophysical Year. He returned to his post as Deputy Director after the event ended, serving until 1963. Truesdale returned to the NLRB in 1963. He was appointed Associate Executive Secretary, and served in that role until 1968. He was promoted to Deputy Executive Secretary and served in that capacity until 1972. Truesdale had a positive opinion of Edward B. Miller, the Nixon-appointed chair of the NLRB chair from 1970 to 1974. \\"He did not come to the board to execute a management agenda,\\" Truesdale said in 2006. \\"He was a very fair-minded person; he worked well with his colleagues.\\"Jensen, Trevor. \\"Edward Miller: 1922‚Äì2006.\\" Chicago Tribune.

First NLRB term, 1977‚Äì1981 President Jimmy Carter nominated Truesdale to be a Member of the NLRB on September 26, 1977, to fill the unexpired term of Peter D. Walther (who had resigned).Gross, p. 242. The AFL- CIO was pushing Daniel Pollitt for the seat. Pollitt had been special counsel to Frank McCulloch, chair of the NLRB during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and employer groups (such as the Business Roundtable and United States Chamber of Commerce) were adamantly opposed to him. Walther and NLRB chair John H. Fanning were advocates of Truesdale, however. Employer groups felt Truesdale was somewhat liberal but would help push Fanning to adopt a more moderate course. Carter, not wishing to begin a political fight over what was perceived as a minor appointment, nominated Truesdale.Gross, p. 243.

The United Steelworkers of America had won an election, 134 to 104, at a specialized steel manufacturer, General Knit, Inc. The company asked the Board to overturn the election because the union had distributed a leaflet on election day questioning whether the company had made a profit. In 1977, the Board had held in Shopping Kart Food Market, 228 NLRB 1311 (1977) that elections should only be set aside only when egregious misstatements of fact occurred during election campaigning.The Board had first ruled on the issue in Hollywood Ceramics, 140 NLRB 221 (1962). But after 15 years, the Republican-dominated Board overturned Hollywood Ceramics in Shopping Kart Food Market. See: Twomey, p. 114.

President Carter had nominated Executive Secretary William Lubbers to be the Board's General Counsel on November 28, 1979,Public Papers of the President..., p. 2166. but when Republican Senators said they would filibuster the nomination Carter used his recess appointment powers to elevate Lubbers to the post.Shabecoff, Philip. \\"Nominee Opposed by Businesses Gets Temporary Job at N.L.R.B.\\" New York Times.

Truesdale's appointment, and his service until 1994, testified to his impartiality as Board executive secretary. For example, in 1989, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland asserted that Reagan-era appointees to the board had tilted their decisions heavily toward management and had failed to impose harsh penalties on employers to violated the law. Truesdale defended the Board, noting that only one member (Mary Miller Cracraft) had any employer connection before her service.Tolchin, Martin. \\"A.F.L.-C.I.O.

Truesdale defended Cracraft as utterly impartial, and said that the National Labor Relations Act's penalties were intended to be remedial and not punitive.

During this period, Truesdale also pushed for the Board to engage in a rulemaking regarding the Supreme Court's decision in Communications Workers of America v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735 (1988). In that decision, the Court held that, in a union security agreement, unions are authorized by statute to collect from non-members only those fees and dues necessary to perform its duties as a collective bargaining representative. The rights identified by the Court in Communications Workers of America v. Beck have since come to be known as \\"Beck rights.\\" In October 1991, White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray began criticizing the Board and then-chair James M. Stephens for not adequately enforcing workers' Beck rights.Gould, p. 128. Stephens had already proposed at this time a rulemaking on the issue,It had taken this decision in March 1992. See: Zebrak, p. 152. and in October 1991 and May 1992 Stephens acceded to requests by White House staff to show them the rule so they could provide comments on it.Gould, p. 128-129.

On September 3, 1992, even though the public comment period on the rule had closed, the White House sent a memo to Executive Secretary Truesdale indicating that comments on the rule were coming from the White House, that these comments should not be made public, that the White House expected these comments to be incorporated into the rule, and that the White House wanted to see the final rule before it was published.Gould, p. 129. Truesdale and the Board's Solicitor General, John Higgins, sent a memo to the Board the following day outlining the White House's requests and positions.Gould, p. 129-130.

March 19, 1996. Second NLRB term, 1994 On January 24, 1994, President Bill Clinton used his recess appointment powers to elevate Truesdale to the Board once again. Truesdale served just 38 days, until March 3, 1994. The recess appointment came about due to a more urgent problem: the long-stalled nomination of William B. Gould IV, a Stanford University law professor. President Bill Clinton had nominated Gould to the NLRB in June 1993 with the intention of naming him chair.The chair of the NLRB is selected from among the existing members of the NLRB, and serves as chair at the pleasure of the President of the United States. Being named chair does not require Senate approval. But Gould's appointment was held up by Senator Nancy Kassebaum, who (according to the New York Times) wanted to exercise power over Republican appointments to the Board.Lewis, Anthony. \\"Abroad at Home: Running the Gantlet.\\" New York Times. January 31, 1994.Traditionally, one or more members of the NLRB resign (out of courtesy to the President) in the first year of a President's first term in order to allow the President to appoint a majority of the Board from members of his own political party. If the chair's term is due to last more than a year into the new president's first term, the chair is one of those to resign. According to Gould, Truesdale was interviewed by the Clinton administration in December 1993 and the offer of another recess appointment to the Board extended to him.Gould, p. 44. The Clinton administration had allegedly discussed the Truesdale recess appointment with Kassebaum, and offered to not appoint Truesdale as chair; in return, Kassebaum would allow the Gould nomination to go forward. According to Gould, the administration also agreed to nominate Charles I. Cohen, a former NLRB attorney practicing with the law firm of Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart.Gould, p. 44-47. The deal-making appeared to have worked, as Kassebaum relented on February 19, 1994.Gould, p. 47. Gould was confirmed, 58 to 38, by the Senate on March 2, 1994.Gould, p. 48-49; Noble, Barbara Presley. \\"At the Labor Board, New Vigor.\\" New York Times. September 4, 1994. In part, Truesdale's appointment was intended to give the National Labor Relations Board a quorum. Due to resignations, long periods between nominations, and long confirmation times in the Senate, only two of the five seats on the Board were occupied. Truesdale's recess appointment gave the Board a quorum and allowed it to conduct business.\\"Clinton Fills Labor Board Temporarily.\\" Associated Press. January 25, 1994. Truesdale's role was also to \\"keep the seat warm\\" for Gould, which is why his tenure lasted just 38 days.Gould, p. 215. Returning to his old role as Executive Secretary, Truesdale pushed the board to re-establish Rule 76‚Äì1,Gould, p. 62. a procedural rule established by the Board in 1976.Woldow, p. 1088-1089. The rule required that, if three members of the Board had agreed to a draft opinion and no dissent had yet circulated, the opinion would be issued within two weeks if no dissent was circulated within that time. On September 30, Truesdale formally asked the Board to re-establish the rule, but the Board declined in favor of other approaches to improve the speed with which decisions were issued. Third NLRB term, 1994‚Äì1996 Truesdale returned to his position as the Board's executive secretary, but on December 23, 1994, President Clinton again named him to a recess appointment on the Board.Gould, p. 55. Truesdale replaced Dennis Devaney, a conservative Democrat appointed to the Board by President George H. W. Bush. This recess appointment lasted until January 3, 1996. According to Gould, Truesdale was a hard worker who produced decisions quickly, but who also adapted his views to changing political winds.Gould, p. 56. He also overwhelmingly supported any request by the General Counsel for legal action to enforce the Board's rulings.Gould, p. 67. Gould and Truesdale clashed repeatedly on the role the Board should play as well. Gould felt the chair should speak out publicly about pending labor law reform and should sponsor conferences on current issues in labor law to keep itself and the staff informed. But Truesdale advocated silence on pending legislation, and that the Board should not create the appearance of partiality by sponsoring seminars.Gould, p. 70. Truesdale played a key role in several important decisions during his term on the Board. Among these were Makro, Inc., 316 NLRB 109 (1995) (better known as Loehmann's Plaza II), in which the Board reversed a precedent (Makro, Inc., 305 N.L.R.B. 663 [1991], also known as Loehmann's Plaza I) established just four years earlier and denied union picketers the right to access an employer's property;Goldberg, p. 1053. Oakland Mall, 316 NLRB 1160 (1995), also known as Oakland Mall II, in which the Board held that nonemployee handbilling on behalf of a labor union may not occur on an employer's property; Leslie Homes, Inc., 316 NLRB 123 (1995), aff'd Metropolitan District Council of Philadelphia and Vicinity United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 68 F.3d 71 (3d. Cir. 1995), in which the Board held that a union may not picket on land occupied by homes being sold by a real estate developer. He also voted with the majority in important cases (California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224 [1995], Paperworkers Local 1033 (Weyerhaeuser Paper Co.), 320 NLRB 349 [1995]) involving the rights of workers who are not union members as established in Communications Workers of America v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735 (1988). California Saw was the NLRB's first ruling in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Beck.National Labor Relations Board, 1997, p. 25. Truesdale and the majority held that whenever a union seeks to make employees pay dues under a union security agreement, it must inform all workers that they have the legal right to remain a non-member of the union and to pay only such fees as may be used for collective bargaining purposes (and no more). Paperworkers Local 1033 (Weyerhaeuser Paper Co.) addressed issues which California Saw did not, and Truesdale and the Board unanimously held that a union must inform all bargaining unit members (not just existing nonmembers) of their Beck rights and that they must inform all union members that they have the right to become a nonmember.The latter holding was intended to enforce NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963). See: National Labor Relations Board, 1997, p. 25-26. In Canteen Co., 317 NLRB 1052 (1995), enf'd. 103 F.2d 1355 (7th Cir. 1997), Truesdale joined with the majority in a major new ruling on successorship. In Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482 U.S. 27 (1987), the Supreme Court had held that if a one company succeeds another, it has a duty to bargain with the previous company's union if there is a substantial continuity between the two companies and the new company retains at least 50 percent of the workforce.Njoya, p. 1984-185. Joining an opinion written by Gould, Truesdale held that the duty to bargain was not sundered by the employer's decision to change wage rates or benefit levels.Gould, p. 77. In Keeler Brass Automotive group, 317 NLRB 1110 (1995), Gould convinced Truesdale and Cohen to change their vote and form a five-member majority in holding that a grievance committee is not a labor organization under the NLRA and hence cannot be a \\"company union\\" (even if employer-dominated).Gould, p. 189. In A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, 320 NLRB 408 (1995), Truesdale joined with Gould against Democratic Member Peggy Browning to interpret the Supreme Court's ruling in Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883 (1984). The Court had held in Sure-Tan that undocumented workers are entitled to back pay awards under the NLRA. In A.P.R.A. Fuel Oil, the collective bargaining agreement required the employer to reinstate laid-off workers first when it begins hiring again. If there were no dismissed workers available, then the employer was required to hire union-referred workers. The union asserted that this included undocumented workers. But Truesdale and the majority held that the Board has no authority to force an employer to hire such undocumented workers.Gould, p. 410. The baseball strike But his most important decision came in the 1994‚Äì95 Major League Baseball strike. Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) had negotiated contracts eight times, and each time a strike action of varying length had occurred.Gould, p. 101-108. By the spring of 1994, the possibility of a strike was rising, as owners and players argued over a salary cap, revenue-sharing (which would \\"tax\\" the sport's top money-making teams and redistribute the funds to the weakest teams), and the extent of salary arbitration.Smith, Claire. \\"All the Signs Are Pointing to Another Major-League Strike.\\" New York Times. May 19, 1994; Chass, Murray. \\"Owners Pull So Hard on Cap, They Can't See Strike in Their Path.\\" New York Times. June 7, 1994. The NLRB was closely monitoring the situation,Gould, p. 108. (in no small part because Chairman Gould was an avid baseball fan).Gould, p. 102. On July 28, the MLBPA set a deadline of August 12, 1994, for a new collective bargaining agreement or it would strike.Chass, Murray. \\"Players Association Sets Strike Date of Aug. 12.\\" New York Times. July 29, 1994. The strike began on August 12,Chass, Murray. \\"No Runs, No Hits, No Errors: Baseball Goes on Strike.\\" New York Times.

October 14, 1994. the World Series was cancelled for the first time in history.Chass, Murray. \\"Owners Terminate Season, Without the World Series.\\" New York Times. September 15, 1994. On December 22, the owners unilaterally imposed a salary cap and eliminated salary arbitration.Chass, Murray. \\"Baseball Owners Implement a Cap on Players' Pay.\\" New York Times. December 23, 1994. On Christmas Eve, MLB announced it would start spring training with strikebreaker players.Chass, Murray. \\"Baseball Braces for a Brave New World of Replacements.\\" New York Times. December 25, 1994. Two days later, the owners and the players' association both filed unfair labor practice (ULP) complaints with the NLRB, with each side claiming the other had not negotiated in good faith.Chass, Murray. \\"Players and Owners File Complaints With Labor Board.\\" New York Times. December 28, 1994. Meanwhile, the NLRB had initiated its own investigation into the strike (led by NLRB Regional Director Dan Silverman and NLRB General Counsel Fred Feinstein).Gould, p. 111. The key issue for the board was whether the legal rules of negotiation had been followed.Gould, p. 110-111. Under American labor law, the employer is permitted to implement its last offer if an impasse had been reached. But the two sides had been negotiating since November, and it was not entirely clear that an impasse had been reached.Gould, p. 109-111. Congress was considering legislation to make baseball subject to United States antitrust law, and on January 26 President Bill Clinton announced that the two sides would have to make major progress to an agreement by February 6 or the federal government would intervene.Jehl, Douglas. \\"Clinton Warns Major Leagues to Settle Strike.\\" New York Times. January 27, 1995. On February 3, the owners unilaterally lifted their salary cap.\\"Pressured Owners Lift the Salary Cap.\\" New York Times. February 4, 1995. But with no agreement even close, Usery hinted that he would recommend a legislative solution (perhaps removing the antitrust exemption, perhaps imposing binding arbitration) to the President.Chass, Murray. \\"It's Clinton at the Bat in Labor Negotiations.\\" New York Times. February 6, 1995. But Republicans in Congress (who had just won control of the House and Senate) signaled they would not enact any such legislation.Gould, p. 112. These developments made it more likely that the NLRB would be the one to decide the fate of the strike. Chairman Gould believed that General Counsel Feinstein was delaying the ULP investigation (perhaps to give negotiations a chance to work), but was troubled when Feinstein allegedly suggested that he become the Board's chief spokesperson.Gould, p. 112-113. Because the Board and the General Counsel are legally independent entities by law, Gould refused to let Feinstein take the lead. Feinstein asked that he be allowed to speak to the entire Board on the issue. Truesdale and NLRB member James Stephens voiced considerable concern over this proposed meeting, as issues in the strike were likely to come before the Board and since the General Counsel and Board were supposed to be at arm's length.Gould, p. 113. When Feinstein became upset at their comments, Gould suggested that he approach the Board's members himself. Feinstein did so, and won a meeting with the Board on March 8. But four of the five members of the Board expressed their dissatisfaction with Feinstein's proposal, and it was dropped. On March 17, Feinstein presented the results of his ULP investigation to the Board and asked the Board to approve a 10(j) injunction.Chass, Murray. \\"Talks Off as N.L.R.B. Summons Parties.\\" New York Times. March 14, 1995; Chass, Murray. \\"N.L.R.B. Cites Baseball's Owners Again.\\" New York Times. March 15, 1995.The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), as amended, authorizes the General Counsel to act as the National Labor Relations Board's representative in the courts. However, the General Counsel cannot initiate suits without the Board's consent. Similarly, the Board cannot enforce its orders without the consent of the General Counsel. Section 10(j) of the NLRA authorizes the Board to seek a temporary or preliminary injunction in any unfair labor practice case. See: Goldberg, p. 1050; McGuiness and Silverberg, p. 16. Five days later, Truesdale and NLRB member Peggy Browning announced they were ready to approve the General Counsel's request.Gould, p. 114. Gould then announced that the NLRB would meet in person on Thursday, Marcy 23, to discuss Feinstein's request (although it had never done so during his tenure before).Chass, Murray. \\"N.L.R.B. Moving Fast.\\" New York Times. March 18, 1995. Although Gould was ready to cast the third and determinative vote, on the night of March 22 Usery asked him to hold off on any decision as the two parties were making progress. Concerned that Usery was too closely aligned with the owners, Gould contacted White House Counsel Abner J. Mikva. Mikva advised Gould that \\"nobody thinks he [Usery] can reach the players. He has lost his influence.\\" Gould informed Truesdale, Browning, and Feinstein of his conversation with Mikva after the call. The next morning (March 23), Gould repeated Usery's request to the entire Board (but not his conversation with Mikva), and recommended that the Board delay action. The Board unanimously agreed to delay its decision until Tuesday, March 28.Chass, Murray. \\"Labor Board Slows Action in Bid to Get Owners and Players Back to Table.\\" New York Times. March 24, 1995. The MBLPA was incensed that Usery had sought a delay from Gould, and negotiations collapsed (for that and other reasons). On the afternoon of Friday, March 24, Gould spoke privately with Truesdale and recommended that since negotiations seemed to be going nowhere (despite Usery's claims) the Board should meet on Sunday afternoon to vote on the 10(j) injunction request.Gould, p. 115. Truesdale agreed, and Gould met privately with each of the other NLRB members to make the same request. Word of the meeting leaked to the New York Times, which published word of the meeting on Saturday, March 25.Chass, Murray. \\"Labor Board and Senate Are Busier Than the 2 Sides.\\" New York Times. March 25, 1995. In what the Associated Press termed an \\"extraordinary\\" session,Abrams, Jim. \\"NLRB's Decision Targets Owners, Injunction to Be Sought.\\" Associated Press. March 27, 1995. the NLRB met on Sunday afternoon, March 26, to discuss Feinstein's request for a 10(j) injunction. Truesdale was highly critical of Gould's repeated contacts and interviews with the press, and the Board voted 4-to-1 to bar contacts with reporters.Gould, p. 115-116. Gould alone dissented, and said he would not abide by the Board's decision.Gould, p. 116. Truesdale, seconded by Member Browning, also said that the Board should not even reveal the outcome of the vote (whether it was 3-to-2 or 4-to-1 or 5-to-0). Gould \\"took strong exception to this view\\". When members Stephens and Cohen demanded that they be allowed to publicize their votes, Truesdale backed off his proposal. Truesdale, Gould, and Browning discussed the injunction request only briefly; Member Stephens, however, made a long speech about the case, labor policy in general, and sports labor law. In the end, after a two- hour meeting, Gould provided the critical third vote (joining Truesdale and Browning) to approve the request for injunctive relief.Chass, Murray. \\"Labor Board to Seek Injunction Against Baseball Club Owners.\\" New York Times. March 27, 1995; Maske, Mark. \\"NLRB Votes to Seek Injunction Against Baseball Owners.\\" Washington Post. March 27, 1995. The day after the decision, Gould says, Truesdale came into his office and subjected him to loud verbal abuse (which devolved into a shouting match) because Truesdale was upset that Gould had spoken to the New York Times about the Board's decision. Gould lunched with Mikva after the incident, at which time Mikva allegedly counseled Gould to allow Truesdale and the other Board members to write opinions supporting their votes in this high-profile case.Gould, p. 117. Gould was unwilling to do this, and told Mikva that Truesdale was too deferential to the General Counsel's requests to make that a valuable exercise. On March 28, Gould learned that Truesdale was about to publish comments critical of Gould's contacts with the press during the baseball strike.The comments were made in a statement issued to Daily Labor Report, a labor relations industry newsletter. See: Flynn, p. 518, 519. Gould asked Mikva if the White House would be willing to privately discipline Truesdale, but Mikva indicated it would not. On March 31, 1995, Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the NLRB's request for a 10(j) injunction, and the players returned to work in time for the 1995 baseball season to begin.Chass, Murray. \\"Backed By Court, Baseball Players Call Strike Over.\\" New York Times. April 1, 1995. On September 29, 1995, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Judge Sotomayor's injunction.Chass, Murray. \\"Appellate Court Rules in Favor of Players.\\" New York Times. September 30, 1995. Aspects of Truesdale and Gould's relationship seem highly contentious. But Michael J. Goldberg, Vice Dean at the Widener University School of Law, says that, while they differed on policy, their relationship was on the whole good and Truesdale's later account of his time on the NLRB with Gould is one of the more balanced ones.Goldberg, p. 1045-1046. See also: Truesdale, 2000, generally. NLRB chairmanship, 1998‚Äì2001 Truesdale retired after his third term on the NRLB ended in 1996, although he continued to act part-time as a labor arbitrator.Skrzycki, Cindy. \\"For NLRB, an Improvement in Its Own Relations.\\" Washington Post. December 25, 1998. William Gould's term as NLRB chair ended on August 27, 1998.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Parting Shots by Labor Board Chief.\\" New York Times. July 23, 1998. Two days later, the Clinton White House asked Truesdale to return to the NLRB as chair.Skrzycki, p. 63. \\"I was very conflicted about it,\\" Truesdale later said. \\"But I worked for the NLRB for almost 50 years. How can you say no?\\" The administration's rationale for picking Truesdale was his acceptability to employers, conservative groups, and Republicans in Congress as well as a desire to avoid the contentious relationship Gould had with these groups during his tenure as chair. Administration officials also hoped Truesdale would smooth relationships among NLRB members themselves, who often had an unhappy relationship with Gould. Truesdale was given a recess appointment to the NLRB on December 4, 1998, and named chair by President Clinton. His recess appointment was due to expire in August 1999 when the Senate recessed, but he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on November 19, 1999. Truesdale said his only goal as chair would be to reduce the amount of time the Board took to issue a decision. Truesdale's term of office was due to expire on August 27, 2003, but he said that he would step down as chair once a new President was inaugurated in 2001.\\"John Truesdale Continues as NLRB Chairman Following Unanimous Senate Confirmation.\\" Press release.

Accessed 2011-07-28.Skrzycki, Cindy. \\"Changing of the Guard: New President's Choices At Regulatory Agencies Will Set the Course.\\" Washington Post. November 5, 2000. During his tenure as chair, the Washington Post reported, Truesdale helped eliminate a severe backlog of cases. When Truesdale's term began, the Board had about 700 cases pending. James A. Gross, a professor of labor studies at Cornell University, said in 2011 that eliminating the case backlog and shortening the time between a case's initial filing and its resolution was Truesdale's major accomplishment as chair.William J. Gould disagrees with this analysis, at least insofar as it applies to the period through 1999. He argues that the backlog rose in Truesdale's first year by almost 20 percent, and that the median number of days it took to issue a decision rose by almost 62 percent. See: Gould, p. 287-292. True to his position taken during the baseball strike controversy, Truesdale also largely kept the NLRB out of the news media.Stein, p. 507. Ex-chairman Gould alleged that the Truesdale Board failed to issue decisions on many of the policy issues which the Gould Board had been considering, and that the Truesdale Board declined to issue 10(j) injunctions. However, Daily Labor Report (an independent publication which monitors federal labor policy and the NLRB) said that Board members felt the NLRB was much more collegial under Truesdale.\\"Truesdale Reflects on Tenure As Chairman.\\" Daily Labor Report. November 16, 1999, p. A9-A10. Truesdale's term as chair of the NLRB lasted just over two years, and during that time the Board neither overturned much precedent nor generated new doctrine. However, in late February 200, the Board did decertify the Major League Umpires Association and certified the World Umpires Association as the new union for umpires in Major League Baseball. Truesdale wrote the three-paragraph opinion certifying the new union.Blum, Ronald. \\"NLRB Certifies New BB Umps Union.\\" Associated Press. February 24, 2000. The Board also issued two important rulings in October and November 2000. The first, New York University, 332 NLRB 1205 (2000), found that graduate student teaching and research assistants at private colleges and universities were employees as defined by the NLRA. Truesdale convinced Republican Member Peter J. Hurtgen to join himself and Member Wilma B. Liebman in relying on Boston Medical Center, 330 NLRB 152 (1999) (which reversed precedent and found medical interns and residents to be employees) to find the graduate students to be employees.Arenson, Karen W. \\"U.S. Allows Unions of Postgraduates.\\" New York Times. November 2, 2000.There is ongoing debate by the Board over this issue. In Brown University, 342 NLRB 42 (2004), Member Liebman reversed herself and joined a unanimous Board in overturning New York University and returning to the Board's previous precedent. In June 2011, NLRB Region 2's acting director denied a new election for graduate students at New York University. But in doing so, the decision strongly criticized Brown University as wrongly decided, laid out a factual record that would support the ruling in New York University, and concluded that the dual role of student and employee was not incompatible with the NLRA. The graduate students at New York University said they will appeal to the full NRLB. See: Greenhouse, Steven and Arenson, Karen W. \\"Labor Board Says Graduate Students at Private Universities Have No Right to Unionize.\\" New York Times. July 16, 2004; Greenhouse, Steven. \\"N.Y.U.

The same day, in NYP Acquisition Corp., 332 NLRB 1041 (2000), Truesdale convinced Member Sarah Fox to join himself and Hurtgen in significantly modifying the Board's successorship rulings. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation bought the New York Post in 1976.\\"News Corp: Historical Overview\\". The Hollywood Reporter. November 14, 2005. When News Corp. purchased a New York City television station in 1988, federal regulators required Murdoch to sell the Post.Bianco, Anthony. \\"The New York Post: Profitless Paper in Relentless Pursuit.\\" Business Week.

August 21, 1991. and News Corp. purchase the paper again in 1993.News Corp. was able to buy the Post because numerous politicians persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to grant Murdoch a permanent waiver from the rules that had forced him to sell the paper five years earlier. See: Andrews, Edmund L. \\"Murdoch Gets Waiver From the F.C.C. to Buy the New York Post.\\" New York Times. June 30, 1993. The New York Post subsequently laid off large numbers of union workers.Glaberson, William. \\"After His F.C.C. Victory, Murdoch Battles Unions.\\" New York Times.

With the NLRB only at three members due to resignations and delayed confirmations, Truesdale and Hurtgen joined to alter the Board's successorship test by concluding that the subsidiary News Corp. used to buy the paper in 1993 was sufficiently different from the 1976 News Corp. subsidiary and with sufficiently different goals that it did not trigger the Board's successorship duty-to-bargain requirements.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Labor Board Rules for Post Owner on '93 Layoffs.\\" New York Times. November 3, 2000. But in the waning months of the Clinton administration, Truesdale led the Board in making two major new rulings. The first came in M.B. Sturgis, Inc., 331 NLRB 1298 (2000), in which the Board overturned long-standing precedent and permitted temporary workers to unionize.Weaver, Gregory. \\"NLRB Chief Hopes That Successor Follows Trail.\\" Indianapolis Star. April 6, 2001.This ruling was itself overturned by a Republican-dominated three-member Board in Oakwood Care Center, 343 NLRB 33 (2004). See: Joyce, Amy. \\"Temps Lose Bargaining Rights Won in 2000.\\" Washington Post. November 30, 2004. And in Epilepsy Foundation of Northeast Ohio, 331 NLRB 676 (2000), the Board extended the right to have a worker representative present during disciplinary hearings to nonunion employees.Union employees had long enjoyed this right after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. 251 (1975). But the Epilepsy Foundation ruling was itself overturned in June 2004 by a three-member Republican-dominated board in IBM Corp., 341 NLRB No. 148 (2004). See: Joyce, Amy. \\"Temps Lose Bargaining Rights Won in 2000.\\" Washington Post. November 30, 2004. George W. Bush won the 2000 U.S. presidential election, and Truesdale signaled that he would resign his seat on the Board in order to permit Bush to appoint his own chairperson. But there was concern that if Truesdale stepped down right away, the Board would lack a quorum until such time as the Senate confirmed Bush's new appointees.Swoboda, Frank. \\"Openings Leave Panel Up for Grabs.\\" Washington Post. November 5, 2000. Subsequently, Truesdale delayed his resignation from the NLRB. As Bush's nominee for chair, Peter Hurtgen, was confirmed on May 15, 2001, but Truesdale remained on the Board to help the agency maintain its quorum. As his tenure as chair came to a close, Truesdale publicly urged Hurtgen and future NLRB chairs to look hard at existing precedent to ensure Board decisions met the needs of the modern workplace and to continue to keep the backlog of cases low. Truesdale resigned as chair of the NLRB on May 14, 2001, but remained on the Board until resigning on October 1, 2001.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Washington: National Labor Relations Chairman Named.\\" New York Times. May 17, 2001. Rene Alexander Acosta was nominated on October 9, 2001, as Truesdale's replacement on the Board.\\"White House Nominations Sent to the Senate\\" Press release. Office of the President. The White House. October 9, 2001. Acosta was confirmed on November 22, 2002, for Truesdale's unexpired term that ended on August 27, 2003. Retirement and death Truesdale had kind words for his successor, Peter J. Hurtgen. \\"He's not an ideologue,\\" Truesdale said in October 2002. \\"He came from a management background, and I guess he himself would tell you he was a conservative Republican and a management-oriented person. But he was always very fair.\\"Coile, Zachary. \\"Port Mediator Praised as Fair.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. October 5, 2002. Although he was 78 years old when he left the NLRB in 1998, Truesdale continued to work as an arbitrator‚Äîand continued to make headlines. One such ruled came in the Banita Jacks case. In 2008, Jacks was found guilty of starving and then murdering her four children (aged 5 to 16).Alexander, Keith L. \\"Banita Jacks Found Guilty of Murdering Daughters.\\" Washington Post. August 29, 2009. Four days after the bodies were found, District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty fired six employees of Washington's Child and Family Services Agency, saying they \\"just didn't do their job.\\"Dvorak, Petula and Namakura, David. \\"Fenty Fires 6 in Girls' Deaths.\\" Washington Post. January 15, 2008. Three of the social workers filed grievances with the city. Truesdale was assigned to the case as an arbitrator. In September 2008, Truesdale issued an opinion in which he ruled that all three had been illegally terminated. Truesdale ordered the city to rehire the social workers at the same pay and benefit grades, expunge the incident from their personnel records, and give them back pay (with interest) and benefits for the period while they were terminated.Dvorak, Petula. \\"Reinstate 3 Social Workers, D.C. Told.\\" Washington Post. September 6, 2008. The District of Columbia appealed to the city's Public Employee Relations Board, and as of June 2010 the case had not been heard. See: Dvorak, Petula. \\"D.C. Social Workers Fired in Maelstrom of Banita Jacks Case Should Be Reinstated.\\" Washington Post. June 25, 2010. Another case involved the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD). In 2007, newly appointed MPD Chief of Police Cathy L. Lanier announced the \\"All Hands on Deck\\" policy, in which all 4,000 MPD officers worked for three straight days to patrol high- crime neighborhoods and execute arrest warrants.Klein, Allison and Johnson, Jenna. \\"Police OT Credited in Crime Dip.\\" Washington Post. June 12, 2007. Several \\"All Hands on Deck\\" periods occurred in 2007, 2008, and 2009. The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), a labor union representing police officers in the District of Columbia, filed six to 10 grievances over the practice, claiming it violated the collective bargaining agreement and broke D.C. law. In September 2009, Truesdale filed an arbitrator's report in which he held that the MPD forced officers to change vacation days and tours of duty in violation of the union contract, failed to bargain with the FOP over these unilateral contract changes, and ordered the city to halt the \\"All Hands on Deck\\" initiative.Labbe-DeBose, Theola. \\"'All Hands' Program Runs Into Trouble.\\" Washington Post. September 12, 2009.Jourdan, Kristi. \\"Arbitrator Says All Hands on Deck Unlawful.\\" Washington Times. September 11, 2009. He also ordered the MPD to pay overtime (with interest) to those officers who worked extra shifts.

He is a Hebrew Nazarite, the founder of The Bad'lanim, a minority sect of Judaism and a vegetarian since 1995. Lieberman is often considered an outsider musician, described as \\"walking the line between insanity and \\". This has been partially attributed to his lifelong struggle with bipolar disorder, which first struck him in 1970 at the age of 11, as well as his decade-long fight with progressive leukemia in his later years, which ultimately was deemed terminal and has become a recurring theme in his lyrics. By the end of 2017, Lieberman stopped all cancer treatment. From this time, he was in and out of home hospice care. After being admitted into home hospice care in early 2018, Lieberman, during his last years of recording had produced his most prolific and sometimes most experimental music of his career, as he was aware time was running out on him. Lieberman had arranged orchestral parts to blend with his punk/thrash style, fusing it to progressive rock (The Gangsta Rabbi's Punk Thrash Thick as a Brick/A Passion Play), opera (recreating a fully orchestrated three-hour version of Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore) and his classical punk/thrash fusion The Gangsta Rabbi's Thrash Opus Year 1812 Festival Overture in E‚ô≠ Major, lasting 38 minutes. On 12 March 2019, he finished his epic project, \\"La Symphonie-Thrashe du Professeur-Juif Rebele\\" (the thrash symphony for the Gangsta Rabbi), where he arranged, orchestrated and recorded playing eighteen different instruments over forty opuses, based on his punk catalog running over five hours long . Steve Lieberman at his grave However, in his last project, The Noise Militia (#38/76), combines noise-punk with military music, singing and playing all the instruments of a heavy rock band and marching band. As of September 2020 the song contained 39 opuses running over 26 hours long. Over his career, he has commercially released 38 CDs and 38 cassette albums in the underground, using the Bop Bop Bigger Bab-√®L moniker and reissued in 2016 for the 25th anniversary of his first cassette album, \\"Bang the Bass Bopmania\\" as \\"Bop Bop Bigger Bab-√®L featuring Steve Lieberman\\". On all his releases, Lieberman sings and plays all instruments. On the early primitive-sounding cassette releases during the 1990s he played chords and leads on a distorted bass accompanied by a Yamaha DD-6 drum machine. By 2002 as he started releasing commercial cd's, he added and featured flutes as well as various brass instruments and a variety of Eastern instruments. In his later years, he has added 6-string guitars and arranged and played a full brass and woodwind choir in an effort to fuse punk rock with marching band music and jazz, and eventually opera and classical He shared the stage with Weezer, Andrew WK, Glassjaw, Ryan Dunn and the Misfits before retiring from performing in December 2011 to battle accelerated phase myeloprolifirative leukemia. He briefly returned to the stage in the spring of 2016 to perform Gangsta Rabbi's Quadrophenia performed in its entirety on a three-stop farewell tour as a solo act, accompanying himself on his trademark distorted bass, a 3-string Fender Stratocaster and alto trombone, as he remained prolific in the studio, producing nine full-length CD's since 2012. In 2009, Lieberman signed a multi-album deal with Jewish indie label JDub Records, taking the place of Matisyahu on their artist roster. As of the spring of 2011, Lieberman, a town comptroller by trade, was \\"the world‚Äôs only Orthodox Jewish heavy metal musician with a record deal\\", according to Newsday. His 2010 song \\"No Festival of Lights (On This Hanukkah)\\" has received honorable mention placement in the Song of the Year Award Although Lieberman's music seemingly had little commercial success, unaudited download and stream sales of his first 37 records topped 3,000,000 in 18 years .In September 2018, Lieberman's single, \\"The Diarrhea Song\\" had briefly appeared on the Apple iTunes Top 100 UK Rock chart, peaking at #22.He received airplay on Rich Russo's free-form Anything Anything with Rich Russo radio show on New York City WRXP 101.9 and WDHA-FM 105.5 commercial rock radio stations. Throughout the shows Lieberman's music was featured on, Russo described him as \\"Jethro Tull meets the Beastie Boys, a one-man Jethro Tull\\" as well as \\"an inspiration to all suffering from serious illness\\" Additionally, Lieberman enjoyed some success on college radio, where The Rabbi Is Dead peaked at #3 on KZSU Stanford University in 2012 and \\"Jewish Pirate\\" had a one-week appearance at #8 on WUSB (FM) Stony Brook University two years after release in 2008. In the spring of 2013, as his cancer progressed to myelofibrosis leukemia, Lieberman took the now obscure biblical Nazarite vow for life which he later attributed to his unexpected relatively long survival with the disease. In the fall of that year, he announced plans for a final album to be called Cancer Ward which was released on 30 December 2014. It is a concept album, dealing with Lieberman's six-month-long chemotherapy treatment at Memorial Sloan- Kettering, the third consecutive course of treatment which failed to suppress his disease's progression. The repeating theme of Cancer Ward is Steve Lieberman, living on borrowed time with a resistant uncurable cancer, while always contemplating his imminent, early demise. Lieberman took a full year to finish \\"Cancer Ward\\" because of frequent hospitalization . Life and career 1958‚Äì1991 the early years Steve Lieberman was born on June 21, 1958 in Brooklyn, NY to a working-class Jewish family. At the time of his bar-mitzvah in 1971, Lieberman, already an observant Jew, acquired a bass guitar to fill a vacancy in his junior high school jazz band. He picked up the instrument and started playing it upside-down and backwards. After passing the jazz band audition, he had developed a crude system of chords for the bass; when properly distorted, they mimicked the major chords of the 6 string guitar. Forgoing this method for more conventional bass playing, Lieberman became the bassist for hard rock as well as jazz-rock fusion bands throughout high school. During this time, he suffered from major depressive disorder and committed parasuicide at age 17. Amidst episodes of depression and mania, Lieberman graduated from college in 1980 with a BBA in accounting, where he worked his way up to become town comptroller by 1998, a position he held until his retirement in September,2014. He was on hiatus from music through much of the 1980s except for recording a vinyl single \\"Nuclear Blitz (Edits 96 and 85)\\" in 1984, playing all the chords and leads on the bass guitar. Lieberman was married four times and divorced three times by his 33rd birthday and widowed at age 60. 1991‚Äì1994 the underground cassette trade He planned to return to music briefly in the spring of 1991, to commemorate his 20th year of playing the bass, this time accompanying himself with a used Yamaha DD-6 drum machine. By year's end he recorded a 13 track cassette called Bang The Bass Bopmania. Overdubbing tracks by using two portable cassette players, Lieberman started writing and recording bass-only crude punk/hardcore music. There was a free paper in the New York area at the time called The Musician's Exchange that would review Lieberman's cassettes and those of like-minded musicians in a column called \\"Independents' Day.\\" This resulted in trading tapes amongst the musicians and circulating them throughout the underground. Lieberman recorded under the \\"Bop Bop Bigger Bab'el\\" moniker from 1991 to 2001. 1994‚Äì2001 enter The Gangsta Rabbi-stage left Steve Lieberman with curve-headed flute 21 October 2007 In 1994, Steve Lieberman began to study the Bible continually, as he did in the years following his bar-mitzvah. This time, he realized discrepancies between the Word in the Bible and the way modern Judaism is practiced. An example of this is that the modern Jewish calendar, besides having its months named after Babylonian gods violates a commandment given in Exodus 12:1, where the new year must be celebrated on the new moon directly preceding Passover, so why do 10 million Jews disobey God by celebrating \\"Rosh Hashannah\\" in the seventh month? After confronting a rabbi with this question after he performed a grave unveiling ceremony, and the rabbi was unable to answer, Lieberman recorded his 20th tape entitled Gangsta Rabbi, the title track becoming his theme song and stage name ‚Äì because \\"he likes to pick theological fights with actual rabbis\\". His biblical studies caused Lieberman to break off from existing Jewish sects to found the Badlan'im (Heb:\\"isolationists\\") sect in 1995 where precepts include fasting, continual prayer, vegetarianism, and belief in only the Bible as the law, so that God's word is not superseded by that of the Talmud and other rabbinical writings. Additionally, he replaced the calendar from the current system, in the 58th century, to a more appropriate system, being in the 35th century, commemorating the Exodus from Egypt. Packaging a live cassette from a First Night festival on New Year's Eve 1994 as Mission of Tolerance 5755-Live, the Musician's Exchange's head writer Paul Incinitti said of Lieberman's show, \\"based on the sound of the screaming crowd, Lieberman should tour and call (the tour) \\"No Sleep To Gaza\\". He is every skinhead's nightmare\\". 2001 ashes of Bad'lania After the release of his 36th cassette, Diaspora Blaster 36 in the spring of 2001, Steve Lieberman's house and studio were completely destroyed by an electrical fire. Acquiring a used flute and a book on how to play it, he wanted to start a genre that would fuse the flute with punk rock, as Jethro Tull did for blues-rock three decades prior. 2002‚Äì2003 By the spring of 2002, the studio and house were rebuilt and Lieberman purchased a Korg D1600 16 track digital recorder. Deciding that the user's manual was too thick and a bit boring, he just plugged in and winged it and three months later, out comes his first CD Bad'lania Rising, a \\"greatest hits\\" collection of the first 38 tapes. The title was the sequel of his last tape Ashes of Bad'lania where \\"Bad'lania\\" is the homeland of his Badlan'im sect. Bad'lania Rising By its 27 August 2002 release songs from Bad'lania Rising were known through the use of on-line music distributors; the largest at the time was mp3.com. His song \\"Puppy\\" debuted at 719 in the Garage Chart and \\"Gangsta Rabbi\\" at 1229 on the Jewish/Israeli list on mp3.com on 6/24/2002, the first day after release. Looking for a genre that would best tolerate his new style, the progressive rock community showed least objection. In a review in their site progressiveworld.net which yielded Bad'lania 2 out of 5 stars said the record was \\"awful\\", but praised his newly learned flutework which was played over the racket of everything else and closed by saying \\"we are fascinated by the eccentric ... but... I just can't say I enjoy listening to it.\\". Jewish Lightning Re-recording many of the post-1996 heavily Jewish-themed tunes with the exception of the new Astroland Spring- Green '415, Lieberman's second CD Jewish Lightning was released on 16 September 2003. This record, as Bad'lania, received some poor grades for listenability because of Lieberman's overuse of ethnic instruments and non- conforming methods in the studio, but for the content, \\"identifying with Biblical ancestry and anger towards the Holocaust\\" he was dubbed \\"a proud Israelite poet\\" by Binyamin Bresky at Cleveland Jewish Radio.Bresky, Binyamin \\"Steve Lieberman-Gangsta Rabbi-Jewish Lightning Additionally, in a tribute to Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal after his 2005 death, Jewish music journalist Baron Dave Romm said of Lieberman in a review of Lightning, \\"his energy and attitude are infectious. He has something to say and by damn he's going to say it ... he's as fearless as Simon Wiesenthal and just as smolderingly angry.\\" Desert Fever Brigade The Desert Fever Brigade sessions during the spring and summer of 2003 yielded 35 songs of which 21 of the most \\"commercial\\" were included on the CD. The album was released on 29 December 2003. Reviewers showed the work little respect, as Adam Mico of the Daily Vault said in his review of DFBMico, Adam -The Daily Vault \\"Flogged Mercilessly On 01/05/04\\" Desert Fever Brigade by Steve Lieberman‚ÄîMr Lieberman has no control center in the brain, hence this CD sounds the way it does. After Desert Fever Brigade's release, Steve Lieberman held the #1 artist spot on mp3.com.au, the largest on-line distributor in Australia, for 6 weeks spanning December 2003 ‚Äì January 2004.mp3com.au Artists Charts MP3 Downloads from mp3.com.au week ending 03 Dec 2003 2004‚Äì2005 skinheads in my yard oy vey Liquidatia-455 For the release of his 4th album Liquidatia-455, he was invited to promote the album by Jill Morrison at WUSB (FM) on 9 June 2004. \\"Liquidatia\\" charted on some college radio Top 30 charts at Harvard (#28), Montclair State (#6), Duke University (#30) and Stanford (#27). Jewish Riot Oy! Oy! Oy! Steve Lieberman plays bass solo-Cup-A-Cino's Detroit, MI 9/18/2004 In September 2004, Lieberman traveled to Detroit, where he played, recorded and filmed a show and released the results as what would be his 6th CD and first live record called Jewish Riot Oy! Oy! Oy!, released 5 January 2005, The small audience was evident by the limited applause on the recording. Journalist James McQuistion said that \\"Lieberman should seriously consider trying to create a more live-feeling studio experience, as this is the essence of eir music, free of all the unnecessary chaos that Lieberman likes to thread throughout eir music.\\"McQuiston, James \\"Steve Lieberman-Jewish Riot\\" Bill Cuevas, music director at KZSU Stanford University summed up Lieberman's attitude as a live performer in his review of Jewish Riot which peaked at #41 on the station's chart:\\"I just love how its obvious theres like 5 people in the audience while this guy gives the performance of his life.\\" After returning home from Detroit, Buttons, his beloved lab mix who had been the subject of quite a few of Lieberman's songs, had passed at 14 1/2 on 22 September 2004. He played some shows in New York City including CBGB's and the Acme Underground. Author/promoter Steven Blush was promoting a Thanksgiving Eve jam on 24 November 2004 at Don Hills and was the first to book Lieberman as \\"Gangsta Rabbi\\". Arbeiter At The Gate After his attempt in New York City, Lieberman hooked up with the now defunct Long Island Music Coalition (LIMC) headed up by WUSB DJ Rich Hughes, who provided him with some work in clubs. When interviewed about Lieberman by Newsday in the fall of 2004, he said he \\"first heard Lieberman on a local radio show in his car. 'I nearly drove into a tree,' he recalls. But something about the music stuck with him. I like the way he follows his own muse\\". Lieberman released his 5th album, Arbeiter at the Gate, on 18 October 2004. When the Allmusic guide received its copy, because Lieberman dedicated a song \\"The A.M.G.\\" to them, critic Gregory McIntosh reviewed the CD, giving it a surprising 3 1/2 stars citing \\"Mostly, the appeal of Arbeiter at the Gate, and indeed all of Lieberman's work, is the sheer and impressive fearlessness of it\\". Arbeiter peaked at #42 on WXDU-Duke University and on 22 May 2005 hit #87 at KZSU, and two weeks later, \\"Jewish Riot\\" re-entered at #360 one notch lower than \\"Arbeiter\\" holding #359. Jew in the Underground During the early part of 2005, Steve Lieberman frequented open mic night at a club called Munchaba in Levittown, NY. It was hosted by comedian/musician Evan Wecksell who referred to Lieberman as an \\"anti-musician\\". Lieberman and Wecksell did a few shows together called the \\"Jews Who Rock\\" tour. At the same time, Rafer Guzman, the local music reporter at Newsday, came to one of Lieberman's shows and interviewed him for the paper. The cover of the article, published on 27 February 2005, featured a full-page picture of Lieberman playing the bass and singing at the show. In the article, subtitled \\"A Crowd of Seven\\" referring to the generally consistent poor attendance at the show, Guzman, in detail, describes the dynamics of Lieberman's stage show: \\"Then he laid down a barrage of thunderous bass notes and snarled unintelligibly in a gravelly, slurred voice. Each song also featured a wild, high-pitched flute solo, with Lieberman occasionally slapping the bass to sustain the rumbling feedback.\\" Concluding, Guzman states that Lieberman's music is all about his emotions and his message, not his talent. Shortly after, on 7 June 2005, Lieberman released his 7th CD, Jew in the Underground. Punkifier On Tuesday 2 August 2005, the host signing in the artists for the open mic at The Downtown recognized Lieberman from the Newsday article six months prior. Opening with \\"Dogpark\\" from Liquidatia-455 and closing with \\"Punkifier 76-FX\\" from his forthcoming album, the emcee booked Lieberman to open for the Viva La Bam rock show featuring Ryan Dunn and Don Vito the next month. Viva the Gangsta Rabbi Steve Lieberman and his fans at the Downtown 3 September 2005 At the \\"Viva La Bam\\" show at the Downtown, Lieberman had stationed a portable cassette stationed at the end of the stage. He had the results mastered onto a CD which was released as Lieberman's 9th CD (2nd Live), called Viva the Gangsta Rabbi released 6 January 2006. A new local rock magazine was released by editor Tiffany Rizzano called Perpetual Toxins. She stated in the review that \\"Lieberman is a true rocker through and through ... borrowing a bit from experimental rockers Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, British punk rock, such as the Sex Pistols and even '80s hair metal ... He opened up the tune 'Bonkey on the Donkey' playing the flute, giving the song a bit of a Jethro Tull sound\\" and said his voice was more punk styled than Billie Joe when doing his songs in the \\"Green Day Medley\\".  2006‚Äì2007 Melancholia Between the Pirates  Within two weeks of the \\"Viva La Bam\\" show, The Downtown closed down, destroying Lieberman's hope to do another show there. The Munchaba, where he was a regular, closed down the week before. These events as well as the poor reception to his 8th CD Punkifer (released 25 October 2005) caused Lieberman to sink into depression. Punkifer has songs such as \\"4-Hour Stiffy\\", \\"Fall Out Boy Oy Oy Oy\\" and the title song, a tribute to the vintage DOD distortion petal Lieberman used to create the bass sound of the CD, \\"so poorly distorted that every single smack of a bass chord is heard.\\" Jewish Pirate By the fall of 2005, Lieberman began to spiral downward to his worst major depressive episode in over a decade. From this, he then suffered from writer's block, being totally unable to come up with a new song. He decided to record a CD of cover tunes and donate the gross proceeds to the North Shore Animal League, where he adopted his dogs, Buttons (1989‚Äì2004) in 1991 and Midnite Buttons (2004‚Äì2010) in 2004. Recorded December 2005, Jewish Pirate included songs originally done by Bruce Springsteen, Green Day, Jethro Tull, The Butthole Surfers, the Dead Milkmen, and the Grateful Dead amongst others, and was released on 30 May 2006 as his 10th CD. It became his first record to chart on WUSB FM where it hit #8 on 27 October 2006. James McQuiston at NeuFutur Magazine said of Pirate, \\"The results are strong for that of a cover CD, and hopes Lieberman's future recordings will continue in such a direction.\\" In February 2006, Lieberman was featured on a 7-minute clip on Cablevision News 12. However it was only played between 11 am and 4 pm on a Wednesday, to a sparse audience. Melancholia Falling Coming out from a 5-month major depressive episode in the spring of 2006, Lieberman documents it in his first \\"concept\\" CD Melancholia Falling, his 11th CD released 31 October 2006. Syd Nathan of the Good Times Magazine said of Melancholia: \\"Perhaps the most bizarre recording ever to come across my desk... being an old fashioned concept album as it deals with the Rabbi's recent bout of depression and coming with an actual warning against suicide on the cd itself, as the main character takes his life, this is totally convoluted\\".Nathan, Syd ‚Äì Good Times Magazine ‚Äì Demolition 17 April 2007 \\"Steve Lieberman the Gangsta Rabbi=Melancholia Falling\\" Last of the Jewish Pirates The follow-up to 2006's Jewish Pirate, another covers CD for charity, his 12th, was released 7 August 2007. Shake the Missile Base On Shake The Missile Base, his 13th CD released 6 November 2007, the opening track \\"Public Suicide\\" exhibits Lieberman's failing mental health. As described by the chief editor of Smother.net Magazine, \\"A heavily distorted album as is the usual Lieberman fare, he distances himself from sunshine-laden lyrics for angry words of rage, heartache, suicide and depression\\".Smother.net 2/8/2008 Steve Lieberman \\"Shake the Missile Base\\" Jimmy Alvarado of razorcake.org ‚Äì Punk Reviews said of Missile Base: \\"... some will undoubtedly see it as much ballyhooin‚Äô and little talent, others will find a uniquely genius quality in the unpolished delivery of songs like 'Skinheads in My Yard Oy Vey,' 'Love @ Defcon 5,' and 'Rubbin‚Äô One Out for My Baby. 2008‚Äì2009 In early 2008, complications from bipolar disorder got Steve Lieberman committed to the psychiatric ward in a local hospital. Being released in less than a week, in two months' time after that, he had returned to the stage, playing Farmingdale, New York's Crazy Donkey, where he cut himself on stage with a broken fiddle bow. Psych Ward After the experience of his confinement, Lieberman recorded his second concept album, his 14th CD Psych Ward, released 8 June 2008. Senior editor C.W. Ross at Indie Music Stop said \\"The songs' lyrics are a little tough to hear with talk of self-mutilation, cutting, death and suicide, but to get the point across, it's all necessary...Lieberman seems to exist to break the rules of writing, production and instrumentalization, playing a Jethro Tull-style flute and lead and rhythm bass with a vengeance\\". Overthrow the Government When completing work on his 15th CD, Overthrow the Government, released 15 October 2008, a commercial rock radio station was having a contest for players of miscellaneous instruments; the prize was to appear on stage at Madison Square Garden with Weezer. Lieberman submitted the flute intro to I'm Jethro Tull and took 60.4 percent of the vote and got to play the Garden on 24 September 2008. \\"Lieberman has really started to fall into a groove with these last few recordings ... The music that Lieberman creates may be a little hard to get into, but the honesty of this work here is something that should be lauded and commended\\", said NeuFutur Magazine when reviewing the album. Three months after the Weezer show, Lieberman was asked to return to the Crazy Donkey, this time to open for Andrew WK. 2009‚Äì2011 JDub Records' Gangsta Rabbi Diaspora-A Folk-Punk History of the Hebrew Nation Setting out in the fall of 2008 to do a second concept CD, Steve Lieberman took on the history of the Jewish people. Starting with the call of Abraham, going through the Old Testament to the Holocaust and finishing with \\"4th Diaspora-The End Time\\", the underlying message is that so much misfortune befell the people because of their disobedience to God's Law. Finishing the record in January 2009, at the same time the Israel-Gaza crisis erupted, Lieberman closed the album with the controversial \\"For the Children of the Gaza\\". In a June 2009 review in RadioIndy, Lieberman received another comparison to fellow outsider musician Wesley Willis but \\"relying on shock and awe bursts of scorching bass licks and howls of reverent fury to trace the tormented Judaic arc from pre-biblical times to the 21st century\\". Diaspora was Lieberman's 16th CD, released 31 March 2009. DiKtatoR 17 After numerous attempts to contact JDub Records, including sending a copy of Psych Ward in 2008 as well as inviting them to every big show he booked, in November 2009, Lieberman was contacted by the label, who invited him to sign a multi-album five-year deal. Lieberman always wanted to be on the label, as they had discovered Matisyahu and worked primarily with openly Jewish acts. JDub hosted a Punk Purim party called \\"Hamanbashin\\" in February 2010, emceed by Sarah Lewitinn which Steve Lieberman opened for. Seven weeks later on 20 April 2010, JDub Records released the digital version of DiKtatoR 17, being the 27th of only 35 albums released in the label's history. Lieberman visited the JDub offices in March 2011, when they planned to release Lieberman's CD's Jewish Engineer 18 and The Rabbi Is Dead during the summer of 2011 as well as a four-part documentary of his life called \\"A Punk Life: The Gangsta Rabbi Story\\". The video was released in 4 weekly segments starting on Lieberman's 53rd birthday 21 June 2011. On July 12, 2011, the night after the last installment, \\"The Gangsta Rabbi's Studio\\" was released. JDub artists received a personal email from the Chief Operating Officer stating that after the label's nine-year existence, JDub Records was forced to close down citing financial reasons alone. The news went public the next day. When interviewed by PunkTorah, Lieberman was asked about his plans following JDub's closing. Lieberman quipped, \\"I released the first sixteen [albums] on my own and will do the same for numbers nineteen through one hundred plus. As for a new label, I‚Äôll be 104 when that happens...\\" Jewish Engineer 18 Following the formula of DiKtatoR 17, Steve Lieberman produced and physically released his 18th CD Jewish Engineer 18 (a reference to the accounting profession) on 6 July 2010. When presenting the 20-song CD to JDub for digital release, he was told the release must wait because DiKtatoR was released less than three months before. The song \\"I'm Not A White Boy\\" hit #1 on SoundClick.com alternative chart in July 2010, and received an International Association of Independent Recording Artists IAIRA International Top 10 Award. At this time, a stay in the hospital revealed that Lieberman was suffering from a rare chronic bone marrow cancer called polycythemia vera, which progressed to the accelerated stage in the fall of 2011 and then to myelofibrosis leukemia, a condition where the bone marrow transforms to fiber and slowly stops producing blood cells. 2011-2012 My Magic Last Days The Rabbi Is Dead Steve Lieberman plays his 2-headed 50 fret OktoBass Presenting his most commercial effort to JDub Records in March 2011 and the first where Lieberman plays the 6-string guitar, he was advised to trim down the 22-song CD to 12 or 13 tracks which he did. He released the 13 track CD independently on 19 July 2011 because of the demise of JDub Records. My Last Rock Show After the release of The Rabbi Is Dead, Lieberman was diagnosed with myeloproliferative bone marrow cancer and knew he would soon be unable to perform on stage or in the studio. He put together a final tour which was documented in his 20th CD My Last Rock Show, released 7 February 2012. Although poorly produced from cassette masters,My Last Rock Show included tracks of Lieberman as he was backed by a full punk band and a performance of The Dreidel Song at a government-sponsored Hanukkah show. My Magic Last Days Production and release of the next album, his 21st, originally to be called My Magic Tragic Last Days, but later shortened to My Magic Last Days was delayed because Lieberman was unable to work on it due to the quick progression of the disease. It was finally released on 17 July 2012. Although most reviewers shied away from it, it was one of Lieberman's best received albums. The album peaked at #33 after a lack-luster journey through the bottom of the chart on KZSU on 21 April 2013 2013-2014 They Got Me Confined to the Cancer Ward Cancer Ward In May 2012, after the production of My Magic Last Days was completed, for the first time since 1985, Lieberman retired from making music altogether due to his progressing cancer. In October of that year, damage from Hurricane Sandy destroyed many of his instruments and equipment but spared his Korg D1600 recording board. In the spring of 2013, after a year of suspending cancer treatment, his case was taken on by Memorial Sloan-Kettering. A bone-marrow biopsy determined he suffered from myelofibrosis, a condition where a once prolific marrow turns to fiber and slowly stops producing blood cells. In September 2013, Lieberman began undergoing experimental chemotherapy with a drug known only as AUY-922 lasting six months in an effort to reverse progression and to bring back an earlier stage of the disease, perhaps stage 2 polycythemia vera. Instead of having any sort of beneficial effect, the treatment actually progressed the disease, causing Lieberman to be hospitalized frequently, receiving forty-five transfusions between February and December 2014. However, in November 2013, Lieberman rose from his sick-bed to do a quick cover of \\"My Kingdom\\" by Echo And The Bunnymen, his first new output since the My Magic Last Days sessions in May 2012. The disease's progression eventually caused Lieberman's retirement from his 29-year stint as Comptroller for the Village of Freeport. Return of the Jewish Pirate (3rd to 6th Pirate) At the end of his radio interview on 30 December 2014, Lieberman promised to try and release a follow-up to 2007's Last of the Jewish Pirates to be entitled Return of the Jewish Pirate. At project's end, he had released a 76-song, 4 volume set on 19 May 2015, the 70th birthday of one of his greatest heroes Pete Townshend. Due to the overall length of the last \\"Pirate\\" series, Lieberman was not able to get press on the collection after its release. The Jethro Tull / Gangsta Rabbi Connection Steve Lieberman plays one-handed flute solo at a punk rock show 24 April 2010 Being a long-haired male rock flutist, playing in a similar style to Ian Anderson, the connection between Steve Lieberman and British rock band Jethro Tull was established as soon as the 2002 release of Bad'lania Rising. It has songs entitled \\"Ian Anderson\\" (1999), \\"Punk Rock Jethro Tull Song\\" (2001), \\"Jethro Tull FantasyKamp\\" (2004) and \\"I'm Jethro Tull\\" (2008), with the A.M.G. placing Jethro Tull as a similar artist on the page of Steve Lieberman the Gangsta Rabbi. This connection brought reaction to both sides of the Jethro Tull community, those who hate Lieberman and those who love him. The former is evident on one Jethro Tull covers site. A critic says this of Lieberman's covers of Tull's \\"War Child\\", \\"Up To Me\\" and \\"One Brown Mouse\\": \\"I have no idea what drives Lieberman to release this unapproachable stuff and why he chose Jethro Tull as a target.\\" On a site called the Jethro Tull Board which is actually endorsed by Ian Anderson, there is a thread called \\"Gangsta Rabbinian\\" saying \\"I love your innovative and original Jethro Tull-related songs, and your non-Tull songs are great too\\" and posted the lyrics to two of Lieberman's lyrics which express hope to find a peaceful end to the Arab- Israeli conflict, \\"Unholy War In The Holy Land\\" (2004) and \\"For The Children of the Gaza\\" (2009).

According to the art historian and theorist Alan Woods: \\"Her work initially focused on installation, the various printmaking media were used in an attempt to continue and develop the installations by other means. If the event is inevitably lost, a new artwork is launched from it, and as themes and subjects occur and re-occur, their re-generation might usefully be imagined as located within an extended family of images.\\"\\"Behind Appearance\\", Arthur Watson/Alan Woods, edited by Roland Box, 1997 ). Biography Between 1960 and 1972, Shemilt grew up in Craigavad, County Down in Northern Ireland. She attended non-denominational Bloomfield Collegiate School and Victoria College, Belfast during The Troubles where her experiences motivated her to develop the themes of conflict, censorship and psychological constraint in her work.Bloomfield Collegiate School Illustrious Alumni Shemilt is a graduate of the Winchester School of Art and the Royal College of Art. She has exhibited internationally including in Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada, USA, Australia, Italy and Germany. In Britain she has exhibited at the Hayward Gallery and the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London and at the Edinburgh Festival. She was a pioneer of early feminist video and multi-media installation work alongside her fellow artist and friend Helen Chadwick, who selected her for the Hayward Annual in 1979.Hayward Annual Catalogue Of her early video works, only two have survived: Doppelg√§nger (1979),Doppelg√§nger on Vimeo, and Women Soldiers (1984), which were recovered and remastered by the REWIND video art project in 2011.REWIND Shemilt established the printmaking department of the School of Fine Art, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design (University of Dundee) in 1988 and was course director of printmaking from 1988-2001. She is currently professor of fine art printmaking and a professional member of the Society of Scottish Artists and was its president from March 2007 until 2010. Shemilt was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 2000 and of the Royal Geographical Society in 2009. She has collaborated with the video artist Stephen Partridge on several installations, including \\"Rush\\", first exhibited at London's Fieldgate Gallery,Analogue & Digital Exhibition and \\"Quattro Minuti di Mezzogiorno\\", a HiDefinition video installation,Quattro Minuti di Mezzogiorno, on Vimeo exhibited in Italy in December 2010-January 2011. South Georgia In 2002 she was made a Shackleton Scholar and was awarded a Carnegie Scholarship. She is a trustee and vice chair (2002-2020) of the South Georgia Heritage TrustSGHT Trustees established to promote the environmental protection and habitat restoration of South Georgia Island, a natural wilderness in the Southern Atlantic.South Georgia Website In 1998 Shemilt was invited to lead a project to improve the environment of the military base on the Falkland Isles by the then commander, Brigadier David Nicholls. The experiences of the staff and student team she put together led inevitably, to independent artworks by all. Four years later in 2002 this led to the exhibition, \\"Traces of Conflict, The Falklands Revisited 1982-2002\\" at the Imperial War Museum. Shemilt's work in this exhibition was inspired by the abandoned field hospital at Ajax Bay, and according to the Imperial War Museum Keeper Angela Weight, Shemilt \\"was gripped by the aura of a place where the writ of war did not run and young men were tended irrespective of whether they were friend or foe.\\"Traces of Conflict, The Falklands Revisited 1982-2002, edited by Angela Weight, Imperial War Museum, London, 2002 ). A series of embossed prints were acquired in 2020 by the National Museums of Northern Ireland, Belfast Art and science An important strand of her work involves collaboration between art and science. Her work with the Genome Diagram developed by Dr Ian Toth and Dr Leighton Pritchard at the Scottish Crop Research Institute resulted in a portfolio of work including installations, digital animation, prints and music.Genome Diagram In 2013 Shemilt completed a major SciArt commission for the University of Dundee College of Life Science's new Centre for Translational & Interdisciplinary Research building: The Scales of Life which embodies science and the visualisation process. She collaborated with the Regius Professor Michael Ferguson and the architect Jo White. On three facades of the CTIR building, 16 columns of large metal cladding panels incorporate her artistic abstractions which represent the four key scales of life: Molecular, Organellar, Cellular and Tissue. The cladding panels (1.5m wide x 3.6m high) are made from a high quality anodised aluminium and are arranged vertically into groups of four panels. The panels address the essence of the four main scales of life and the intangibility of their size and dimensions. The visual abstractions reflect both an interpretive aesthetic approach, and the need to retain scientific recognition and accuracy. The main objective of the work is that the series of images reflect in a meaningful way the scientific research being undertaken within the CTIR building. The CTIR was officially opened by Sir Paul Nurse on 1 October 2014.http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/news/2014/sep/29/sir-paul- nurse-officially-open-centre-translational-and-interdisciplinary-research Research In 2013 she was awarded a Royal Society of Edinburgh Caledonian European Research Fellowship to study and research in Italy, and was chair of the international printmaking conference IMPACT 8 held in Dundee in August.IMPACT 8 In 2014 she was awarded ¬£234,872 from the Arts and Humanities Research Council to act as principal investigator on the research project European Women's video art in the 70s and 80s (EWVA).UKRI gateway to publicly funded research and innovation A publication associated with the project was published in May 2019.Laura Leuzzi, Elaine Shemilt and Stephen Partridge (eds), (2019), European Women‚Äôs Video Art in the 70s and 80s.

For example, the exhibition, SHE DEVIL 8, in Rome in 2016 was described: :\\"The godmother of SHE DEVIL 8 is Elaine Shemilt with the video performance Doppelg√§nger.

Doppelg√§nger is one of two still existing videos of a series begun by Shemilt in 1974, salvaged in 2011. The term doppelg√§nger is used in German culture to indicate the evil twin (doppel / double, and g√§nger / goer). The doppelg√§nger of Elaine Shemilt is utterly feminine. The artist puts on makeup in front of the mirror in a ritual divided between the face and its reflected image that generates the double, the absolute protagonist of the finale.\\"SHE DEVIL 8 - from press copy of the exhibition, SHE DEVIL 8, in Rome at STUDIO STEFAN MISCETTI Gallery, 16 March-16 April 2016.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Nossa Senhora da Vila, Nossa Senhora do Bispo e Silveiras. It has an area of 121.83 km¬≤, and a population of approximately 5411 inhabitants in 2001 (approximately 44 inhabitants per km¬≤). It contains the localities Fazendas do Corti√ßo, Ferro da Agulha and S√£o Geraldo. History The origin of the civil parish is based in the construction, on the eastern part of the walled settlement, of the first parochial church in 1300 by Diocesano, Bishop of √âvora. After this point, the resident population was connected to changes in the role of the Catholic Church in the region. Its name, referring to Bispo specifically, was based in the community's economic ties to the Bishop of √âvora, since the canons of the Church of Santa Maria da Vila were tied to √âvora's hierarchy. Between the 14th and 16th century the area around the church was occupied by residences and food cellars that collected the land rents of the region. In 1534, the Cardinal Infante Afonso, bishop of √âvora, ordered the reconstruction of the church, including its Manueline era portico (which was historically incorporated into the local logotypes). This church was still the object of public works well into the end of the 17th, beginning of the 18th, century. Tradition suggests that in 1495, Jo√£o Cidade, later canonized S√£o Jo√£o de Deus for his charitable works and founder of the Hospital of Granada (and who inspired the creation of the Order Hospitaler of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus. The parish was the inspiration for the Porta do Bispo (Bishop's Gate), alongside the Torre do Anjo and Rua do Bispo, which connected the churchyard to the centre of the parish. Since its early inception, from outside the walls, an arch of constant development occurred along the accessways that afforded the best conditions and water supplies. Slowly, many of the residences within the walls were abandoned for open spaces that existed outside the walled settlement, yet, the government authority included these areas.

The ANKK1 is a member of an extensive family of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, and protein kinase superfamily involved in signal transduction pathways.  Clinical significance  This gene contains a single nucleotide polymorphism that causes an amino acid substitution within the 11th of 12 ankyrin repeats of ANKK1 (Glu713Lys of 765 residues). This polymorphism, which is commonly referred to Taq1A, was previously believed to be located in the promoter region of the DRD2 gene, since the polymorphism is proximal to the DRD2 gene and can influence DRD2 receptor expression. It is now known to be located in the coding region of the ANKK1 gene which controls the synthesis of dopamine in the brain. The A1 allele is associated with increased activity of striatal L-amino acid decarboxylase.  A1+ allele  * Hepatitis C infection * Antisocial personality disorder * Borderline personality traits * Schizoid/avoidant behavior Given that the A1+ allele is associated with antisocial personality disorder, one may infer that the allele is also associated with narcissistic personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. However, these predictions have not yet been empirically verified.  A1+ genotype frequencies  European population estimates for A1+ genotype frequencies range from 20.8 to 43.4% (National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), identification number rs1800497).  Addictive behaviors  The ANKK1 gene is closely linked to dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) on chromosome band 11q23.1. The A1 allele of the Taq1A polymorphism (rs1800497T), is located ‚âà10kb downstream of the dopamine receptor DRD2 gene. Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter in the brain, which controls feelings of wellbeing. This sensation results from the interaction of dopamine and other neurotransmitters such as serotonin, the opioids, and other brain chemicals. Dopamine increases the motivation for food cravings and appetite mediation. The Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) involves the pleasures or reward mechanisms that rely on dopamine. The result of this deficiency is based on the genetic makeup; this helps explain how certain simple genetic anomalies can give rise to complex aberrant behaviours as the ones mentioned previously. The A1 allelic prevalence has been reported to be significantly higher in obese individuals than in lean subjects, moreover, individuals with increased body mass index (BMI) (BMI >30 kg/m2) have fewer DRD2 dopamine receptors. Investigators have also suggested that hormonal mechanism may underline a gender difference in the ability to suppress hunger in relation to this SNP, which may contribute to the greater incidence of obesity in women compared to men. However, authors have pointed out that A1 carriers have difficulty in learning from negative feedback in a reinforcement-learning task and are less efficient at learning to avoid actions that have negative consequences.

Officers who did not choose to stand for re-election were also offered a discharge. The reorganization was accomplished among all the Arkansas regiments in and around Corinth, Mississippi, following the Battle of Shiloh. After settling in at Camp Churchill Clark, near Corinth, Mississippi, the 19th Arkansas was reorganized for the war and new officers were elected. All of the original field officers were thrown out in the election of May 12, 1862, and in their place the men elected Colonel Thomas P. Dockery, Lieutenant Colonel William H. Dismukes, and Major Horatio G. P. Williams. On June 2, 1862, the two Hot Spring County companies were consolidated. Company D (from Rockport) was merged into Company E (from Hot Springs).

Paroled, exchanged and re-organized This regiment surrendered with the Army of Mississippi at Vicksburg, Mississippi, July 4, 1863. General U. S. Grant initially demanded the unconditional surrender of the Vicksburg garrison, but faced with the necessity of feeding 30,000 starving Confederates and having the idea that these soldiers might do more harm to the Confederate cause by being released to return home rather than being exchanged as whole units, he relented and allowed for the immediate parole of the surrendered units. According to the Confederate War Department, Union leader encouraged the surrendered confederates to simply return home, rather than reporting to parole camps to await their eventual exchange. The able bodied Confederate soldiers who were released on parole walked out of Vicksburg (they were not allowed to proceed in any military formations) on July 11, 1863. Paroling of these able bodied men was completed in their respective regimental camps inside Vicksburg prior to July 11. Those who were wounded or sick in the various hospitals in Vicksburg were paroled, and were released as soon as they could leave on their own. July 15/16 is the most common date of these Vicksburg hospital paroles. Some of the most seriously wounded and sick were sent by steamship down the Mississippi River and over to Mobile, Alabama, where they were delivered on parole to Confederate authorities.Simmons, Hugh \\"Re: 46th AL Co.

Dockery was to arm, recruit, and return to active service the men of his brigade as quickly as they were exchanged. Seddon opined that prisoners who, with the connivance and instigation of the enemy, left Vicksburg before being properly accounted for by their officers, were not properly listed a prisoners, and therefore were free to re-enter service immediately. Seddon also indicated that it might be advisable to distribute these men to other commands rather than keeping them together, but he left that matter up to General Smith. Seddon's letter included Colonel Dockery's commission as a Brigadier General.United States. War Dept.

On August 10, 1863, Colonel Dockery received the following orders from the Confederate Secretary of War: General Kirby Smith acknowledged the receipt of Seddon's letter on September 11, 1863. General Smith reported that he did not expect that Dockery would have as much success as might be hoped for in reassembling his brigade. General Smith indicated that he lack sufficient weapons to arm Dockery's reconstituted brigade and the military situation in Arkansas would likely prevent Dockery and his men from being returned to duty east of the Mississippi river as Seddon had hoped.United States.

On February 27, 1864 Confederate General Richard Taylor reported to Major General W.R. Boggs, Chief of Staff to General Kirby Smith, that during the month of January 1864, \\"1,400 stand of arms were crossed (over the Mississippi River) and distributed among General Dockery's unarmed brigade.\\" By March 1864, Dockery's Brigade, consisting of remnants the now paroled and exchanged Arkansas regiments from Vicksburg and Port Hudson, was stationed near Monticello, in Drew County, Arkansas. General Fagan was with Dockery's Brigade assisting in the organization, but near the end of the month withdrew, leaving Brigadier General Dockery in command of his Brigade and Crawford's Brigade. Many of the regiments were mere skeletons, with companies numbering less than 10 men each, so many consolidations were made with in Dockery's Command. The heavy loss of men sustained by the 19th Arkansas and Johnson's 15th Arkansas, which was surrendered at Port Hudson made it necessary to consolidate these two regiments. But because their enviable records each regiment was permitted to retain its number; and the new regiment was known as the Consolidated 15th and 19th Arkansas Regiment. The regimental officers of the 15th Arkansas had been carried away to Union prison camps in the surrender and not exchanged so Captain Joe, who had managed to escape from Union custody, as senior remaining captain, took command of the remnant of the 15th Arkansas, and Colonel Williams of the 19th was placed in command of the Consolidated Regiment. A portion of the brigade was mounted, and General Dockery took command of this part; and Colonel Williams commanded the infantry portion of the brigade. This left the infantry portion of the 15th and 19th under the command of Captain Joe until the 23rd of May, 1864, when he resigned upon a surgeon's certificate, because of wounds received at Port Hudson. This left Lieutenant Dock in command of Company B in the Consolidated Regiment. General Dockery had mounted a portion of his brigade, ostensibly to help facilitate the re- assembly of the brigade. This action caused friction with Confederate leadership. The Confederate Army had at this point far more mounted commands that was necessary and the logistical requirements to support such a large mounted force far exceeded the ability of the Arkansas country side to support. By late March, Dockery had a portion of his brigade mounted and a regimental size portion of the brigade under the command of Colonel Williams dismounted as infantry. Dockery's Brigade consisted of the following elements:Cluck, Damon \\"Dockery's Brigade during the Camden Expedition\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, posted 2/4/2016, 3:39 pm , Accessed 12 February 2016, http://www.history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs62x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?page=1;md=read;id=30767 The mounted portion under Colonel Dockery consisted of: :18th Arkansas Mounted Infantry Regiment (Carroll's) :19th and 15th Consolidated Mounted Infantry RegimentMartel, G.

Union Major General Frederick Steele led a Union force from Little Rock on March 23, 1864, with the objective of joining forces with Major General Nathaniel Prentice Banks at Shreveport, Louisiana. Confederate forces in Arkansas were directed from Washington, where the Confederate government of the state relocated after the fall of Little Rock. In support of General Steele's movements toward Arkadelphia, Arkansas, Union Colonel Powell Clayton, stationed at Pine Bluff, decided to conduct an attack Colonel Dockery's forces at Monticello. Clayton had received information that Dockery was about to leave Monticello to oppose Steele's movement. The expedition to Mount Elba began on March 27, 1864 when the Powell's forces under left Pine Bluff. Colonel Clayton's force consisted of elements of Eighteenth Illinois Infantry, Twenty-eighth Wisconsin Infantry, Fifth Kansas Cavalry, First Indiana Cavalry, Seventh Missouri Cavalry (US), totaling approximately 237 men. Major General Sterling Price, the commander of the Confederate district of Arkansas, had ordered General Dockery to harass the rear flanks of the Union troop movements and attack Union supply trains. General Dockery's forces consisted of his own brigade and elements of Colonel Crawford's Arkansas Cavalry Brigade, including Poe's and McMurtrey's Cavalry Battalions.Mark K.

Marmaduke to harry the Union column and to prevent it from crossing the Little Missouri River as it moved toward Washington. Advance Union forces clashed with Confederate defenders in the Battle of Elkin's Ferry on April 3. The outnumbered Confederates were forced to withdraw, and General Marmaduke established a defensive position, lightly fortified by earthworks, on the road between Elkin's Ferry and Washington at the western edge of the sparsely-populated Prairie d'Ane, a roughly circular area of prairie surrounded by woodlands. and After waiting for the arrival of reinforcements, General Steele advanced on April 9, but was stopped in the Battle of Prairie D'Ane, a series of encounters that ended on April 12. General Dockery's Brigade assisted Marmaduke's division in Prairie D'Ane, 9‚Äì12 April. After making a feint in the direction of the Confederate state capital at Washington, Arkansas, Steele then turned and occupied Camden, on April 15, in order to resupply his army, which was then on half-rations. Price had stripped Camden of personnel in order to defend Washington, and the Union forces occupied the city against no significant opposition. Battle of Poison Spring After a two-day wait, General Steele sent out foraging parties into the countryside and awaited news from Banks. However, Banks was in retreat, having been defeated at the Battle of Mansfield, and now more of Kirby Smith's forces were heading into Arkansas to intercept Steele. Dwindling supplies for his army at Camden forced Steele to send out a 1,200-man foraging party to gather corn that the Confederates had stored about twenty miles away. After loading the corn into over 200 wagons and proceeding about 5 miles on April 18, Col. James M. Williams's party was savagely attacked by John Marmaduke's division, assisted by the 19th Arkansas as part of Dockery's Brigade at the Battle of Poison Spring. Williams was forced to retreat northward into a marsh, where his men finally regrouped and fell back to Camden, minus the wagonloads of much needed corn. Battle of Jenkins Ferry Steele was relieved on April 20 when a wagon train arrived from Pine Bluff with welcome supplies. One week later, the Battle of Marks' Mills resulted in the capture of 2,000 more of Steele's men and many more wagons. Steele decided to abandon Camden under the cover of darkness and retreated to back toward Little Rock on April 26. Three days later, he reached the Saline River at Jenkins' Ferry and began constructing a pontoon bridge. Smith's Confederates arrived on April 30 and repeatedly attacked the retreating Federals in windy and rainy conditions. Colonel H. G. P. WILLIAMS, of the 19th Arkansas, led his \\"dismounted casuals\\" of Dockery's Brigade on the left of Churchill's Division during the battle and filed the following report of his operations: Colonel Steele repulsed the Confederate attacks and finally crossed with what was left of his force, destroying the bridge to prevent Smith from following. He was compelled to abandon most of his remaining supply wagons in the swamp north of the river. A badly chagrined Steele finally reached his base at the Little Rock Arsenal on May 3. On May 8, 1864, Brigadier General T.J. Churchill reported that the strength of Dockery's Brigade was 870 effectives of 900 assigned.United States. War Dept.

Today it is still unclear and remains to be seen if these two personality disorders are linked to genetically distinct, but overlapping, personality disorders or if these two personality disorders are merely two different phenotypic expressions of the same genetic disorder. Both have been associated with a shared genetic risk factor and the same polymorphism within the ANKK1 gene. There is also some evidence that AvPD (like SPD) is a personality disorder of the schizophrenia spectrum. Originally, schizoid personality disorder involved social avoidance combined with marked ambivalence regarding the desirability of social contact. It included indifference or even cold disdain oscillating with longing for normal relationships. Through the efforts of Theodore Millon, this complex idea was later divided across two disorders with the emergence of a separate AvPD construct and the idea of ambivalence was lost. According to the differential diagnosis guidelines provided in the text of the DSM-IV the two conditions are distinguished by the extent to which the individual desires social contact versus being indifferent to it. But such distinctions are often difficult to apply in practice, as patients often have unclear, marginal, or shifting status on those elements thought most crucial for differential diagnosis. In the case of the avoidant and schizoid PDs, however, both the problem and its solution may be more academic than real. First, research indicates that all of the avoidant symptoms except social withdrawal correlate negatively with the schizoid symptom list and that differential diagnosis is not difficult. Second, as pointed out by Benjamin (1993), schizoid PD is exceedingly rare and the diagnostic quandary may never occur in practice. However, new research shows that both PDs are linked to hypersensitivity.Daniel Winarick: . Psychology Today, Jan. 2017.

A Clarke County historical marker which stands on Woods Bluff Road between Alabama 69 and Cassidy Hill marks the location of the incident which resulted in the death of 4 whites. The exact date of this skirmish is not clear but it is believed to have occurred in early October 1813. At least one source puts it at October 4, 1813. A group of 25 white horsemen led by Colonel William McGrew were proceeding towards a stream called Bashi Creek that flows into the Tombigbee River a mile or two north of Wood's Bluff when they suddenly found themselves among concealed Creek warriors. They were ambushed after a turkey tail was raised above a log by one of the concealed Creek, giving the signal for attack. The Indians who had guns instantly fired from their places of concealment and McGrew who had taken part in the Battle of Burnt Corn was killed along with Edmund Miles, Jesse Griffin and Captain William Bradbury. David Griffin was reported missing and presumed dead; his body was never found.

For the past twenty-two years, Rob Koll has served as the head coach for the Big Red squad. Koll has led the team to eight top-five finishes in the NCAA Division I wrestling tournament, including second-place finishes in 2010 and 2011. The 2010 and 2011 finishes were the best ever for an Ivy League team. In 2012, Cornell wrestling finished fourth in the NCAA tournament, while crowning three individual national champions Kyle Dake (157 lbs), Steve Bosak (184 lbs) and Cam Simaz (197 lbs). This was the first time in program history when there were multiple national champions (3) in the same year. Additionally, Kyle Dake went on to become the only wrestler in U.S. history to capture four individual national championships in different weight classes (141 lbs, 149 lbs, 157 lbs & 165 lbs), Outside of the NCAA tournament, Cornell has been Ivy League champion a record 38 times and was league champion for 17 consecutive seasons between 2003 and 2019. During that streak the team won 92 consecutive Ivy League dual meets. Cornell has won the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association championship 25 times including 11 consecutive titles between 2007 and 2017. These streaks remain the longest in wrestling history for their respective divisions. History In 1907, E.J. O'Connell became the first coach in Cornell wrestling history. He led the team for two seasons with back-to-back winning records as well as a third-place finish at the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association meet in 1907. Walter O'Connell became the next head coach and began a historic 39-year career. Under his direction, Cornell won 11 titles and had 63 individual winners at the EIWA Championships. In 1919, Charles Ackerly won the EIWA Championships at 115 lbs. Ackerly then competed for the United States in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Belgium, where he won the gold medal in the same weight class. Cornell also saw its first national champion under O'Connell as Glen Stafford won the individual national title in 1928 at 175 lbs. In 1947, Jimmy Miller took over as head coach and led the Big Red to 203 dual meet wins in his 27-year tenure. Cornell crowned two national champions in 1953, Frank Bettucci (147 lbs) and Donald Dickason (167 lbs). Three years later, Bettucci was able to win matches at the 1956 Olympic Trials, though he did not qualify. In 1960 and 1961, David Auble won back-to- back national championships, which allowed him to compete for the U.S. in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo (he placed fourth). Carmon Molino also competed for Miller and the Big Red and was an alternate on the 1964 U.S. Wrestling Team in Tokyo. Molino later became assistant coach for Cornell from 1967 to 1972 and again from 1974 to 1992. J. Andrew Noel took over as head coach in 1974. In his 14 years, Noel led Cornell wrestling to four Ivy League Championships. During this time, Cornell wrestling grew its network and visibility both in the town of Ithaca and the college wrestling world. Jack Spates became head coach in 1988 and led the team to five straight Ivy League Championships before leaving his post for the University of Oklahoma. In these five years, Cornell wrestling posted a .837 winning percentage and a record of 74-14-1. Rob Koll began his tenure as head coach of the Big Red in 1993 and remains in that position today. Koll represents an era of Cornell wrestling that has reached unprecedented success including 19 Ivy League Championships (including 16 consecutive between 2003 and 2018), 11 Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championships, 15 individual national champions, and 14 top ten finishes in the NCAA. In 1994, David Hirsch won the 126-pound title at the NCAA Championships. He also won a career high 41 matches in his senior season and was a three-time first-team All-Ivy pick. Koll also coached dominant Cornell wrestler Travis Lee, who won the national title at two different weight classes: 126-pound in 2003 and 133-pound in 2005. Lee was Cornell's first four-time All-American and four-time Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association champion. Cornell has won 17 consecutive Ivy League Championships between 2003 and 2019. In 2005, Cornell had four All-Americans for the first time in team history. Rob Koll was also named the National Wrestling Coaches Association's Division I Coach of the Year. In 2007, Cornell wrestling won its first Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association championship since 1993 and advanced eight wrestlers to the NCAA tournament. Jordan Lee added to Cornell's list of national champions, winning the title at the 149 lb weight class in 2008. Troy Nickerson also won the national title the next year at the 125 lb class. Cornell finished a school-best 2nd place at the NCAA Championships in 2010 and crowned freshman Kyle Dake national champion in the 141 lb weight class. The 2010-2011 season was a stand out performance by the Big Red. The squad won its ninth straight Ivy League Championship and fifth consecutive Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championship. Up to this point, much of the wrestling world has been dominated by Oklahoma State and Iowa. However, after the end of the regular season in 2011, Cornell was ranked first followed by Iowa, Oklahoma State and Penn State. The team eventually finished second in the NCAA tournament, but Kyle Dake was able to repeat as national champion in the higher weight class of 149 lbs. In 2012, Cornell crowned three national champions for the first time in program history. Junior Kyle Dake made his own history by winning his third national title in three separate weight classes (this year at 157 lbs). Steve Bosak and Cam Simaz each won national titles at the 184 lb and 197 lb weight classes respectively. The team finished fourth in the NCAA tournament. This year also marked 5 All-Americans for the Big Red, a 10th consecutive Ivy League Championship and sixth consecutive EIWA Championship. Coaches E.J.

Notable alumni Cornell wrestling has had 4 alumni compete in the Olympic Games, all representing the United States in the years they competed. Charles Ackerly '20, was the only medal recipient, winning gold in the 1920 Summer Olympics freestyle featherweight wrestling category. Milton McWilliam '24 and Walter Wright '24 competed in 1924 and Dave Auble '60 in 1964. Another notable alum is Stephen Friedman '59, sole chairman of Goldman Sachs from 1992 to 1994. He held several executive roles in the years prior and is still a member of the board. He was chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush and is the former Chairman of the United States President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. While at Cornell, he was a star wrestler, winning the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championship in 1959. Both the Friedman Strength and Conditioning Center and the Friedman Wrestling Center at Cornell University were named in recognition of gifts he made to the university. He was inducted into the Cornell Athletic Hall of Fame in 1984. Team marketing and fundraising Under Rob Koll's direction, Cornell Wrestling has been marketed through some of the most notable newspapers and wrestling cites including The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Cornell Daily Sun, Ithaca Journal, themat.com, wrestlingreport.com, flowrestling.com, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and many more. With over 14,000 likes on Facebook and nearly 4,000 Twitter followers, Cornell Wrestling remains one of the most followed Division-1 wrestling programs in the country. Koll accomplishes this through a number of means; however, as of fall in 2010 he invented an unofficial wrestling mascot known as Redman. While the mascot for Cornell University is the Big Red Bear, Koll felt the need to create a mascot solely for the wrestling team. His appearance is representative of the sport itself, wearing red spandex's covering from head to toe, coupled with a white Cornell Wrestling singlet. Additional attributes include: sunglasses, Cornell C tattoo, wrestling shoes and wrestling headgear. Although Redman's identity remains secret, he promotes the program through his acrobatic dance moves at wrestling events. Koll specifically markets wrestling matches using Redman in commercials posted on Facebook and YouTube. In November 2010, The Cornell Daily Sun interviewed Redman asking him 10 questions about his originality and purpose. Facilities The Friedman Center is the home of Cornell Wrestling. The first arena in the nation built solely for wrestling, the Friedman Center opened in January 2003 on Campus Road. Named for alumnus Stephen Friedman and trustee Barbara Benioff Friedman, the 15,000-square-foot building was designed with state-of-the-art training and weight rooms with custom-designed weight machines. It features a 1,000-seat arena, a student lounge, and locker rooms. The arena floor was specially designed with \\"extra yield\\" for wrestling matches.

In 1912, when these locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered and designated .Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1944).

Hendrie, who had succeeded G.W. Reid as Locomotive Superintendent of the NGR on 8 January 1903, was a tank locomotive. It was built by the newly established North British Locomotive Company (NBL) in the former D√ºbs shops in Glasgow, Scotland.The Railway Report for year ending 31 Dec. 1908, Natal Government Railways, p. 39, par 14. Twenty-five of these locomotives were delivered in 1904, numbered in the range from 250 to 274. Until they were designated Class E at some stage between 1904 and 1908, they were known on the NGR as the D√ºbs B or Improved D√ºbs, even though D√ºbs and Company had already ceased to exist when the locomotives were built, having been merged into the NBL.North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser Characteristics D.A. Hendrie The locomotive was intended for use on mainline work and Hendrie used the Reid Tenwheeler (NGR Class C) and the D√ºbs A (NGR Class D) as basis for its design. The result was an engine which looked like a smaller version of the Reid Tenwheeler locomotive. With a larger boiler and working at a higher boiler pressure, the Class E was a more powerful locomotive than the NGR Class D, but Hendrie had made no radical changes in the basic design to the work of his predecessors. The engine had inclined cylinders, arranged outside the plate frames. Its balanced slide valves were arranged above the cylinders and were actuated by Stephenson link motion through rocker shafts. The locomotives were the first in South Africa to have \\"H\\" section coupling rods and connecting rods. South African Railways left When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, NGR and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, these locomotives were designated Class G on the South African Railways (SAR) and renumbered in the range from 197 to 221.Classification of S.A.R. Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, Pretoria, January 1912, pp. 7, 11, 13, 22 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) Service The locomotives entered service working the mainline passenger Corridor Trains out of Durban, but they were soon replaced by the NGR Class B tender locomotives, Hendrie's second locomotive design, which entered service later in 1904. They were then used as banking engines from Ladysmith up the Van Reenen Pass on the rail connection between Natal and Harrismith in the Orange River Colony. They remained in use there as well as in general service on some of the heavier branch lines until the loads became too heavy for them. By 1944, six of them were still working in light shunting at various marshalling yards in the Union. The last pair were withdrawn from shunting service around Pietermaritzburg in 1962. Several were sold to mines and other industrial concerns.

Club career Juventus Pinsoglio began his career with Italian giants, Juventus and after working his way up the youth ranks at the club, he was promoted to the Primavera youth squad in 2007. Pinsoglio was the starting goalkeeper since 2008 until his youth team graduation at the conclusion of the 2009‚Äì10 season.Fullsoccer Upon his promotion to the Juventus first team, Pinsoglio was sent out on loan to Lega Pro Prima Divisione side, F.C. Esperia Viareggio, where he became the club's starting goalkeeper. Coincidentally, fellow Juventus product, Giorgio Merlano served as his back-up. Pinsoglio went on to make 25 league appearances for the club in his first professional season and he returned to Turin on 30 June 2011. Once returned to Juventus, Pinsoglio was again sent on loan. In July 2011, he joined Serie B club Pescara along with Ciro Immobile. On 10 September 2011 he made his debut as the first choice goalkeeper in the home match won 2‚Äì0 against Crotone. In the first half of the 2011‚Äì12 Serie B season, he served mostly as a backup to veteran Luca Anania, making just 5 league appearances. In January 2012, Pinsoglio was recalled by Juventus, who then went on to sell the player in a co-ownership deal to fellow Serie B side, Vicenza Calcio. Vicenza Pinsoglio officially completed his switch to Vicenza in January 2012, as part of the deal of Fausto Rossi, Pinsoglio's 50% registration rights was valued ‚Ç¨1.5 million and Rossi for ‚Ç¨1.7 million. Again, Pinsoglio was mostly deployed as a back-up goalkeeper. He became the club's second choice, playing behind Alberto Frison, and ahead of veteran Paolo Acerbis. He made just 3 league appearances in his first 5-moths with the club, which ultimately ended in relegation from Serie B to the Lega Pro Prima Divisione following a play-out loss on aggregate to Empoli F.C.. The club was, however, reinstated in Serie B, thanks to the enforced relegation on U.S. Lecce due to their involvement in the 2011 Italian football betting scandal. He began the 2012‚Äì13 Serie B season as the club's first choice goalkeeper, following the sale of Frison to Calcio Catania. Pinsoglio made 20 league appearances before losing his place to January 2013 arrival Nicolas Bremec. Vicenza were relegated at the end of the season and will thus take part in the 2013‚Äì14 Lega Pro Prima Divisione. On 20 June 2013, the co-ownership between Vicenza and Juventus of Niko Bianconi, Luca Castiglia and Pinsoglio were renewed with the registration rights of Castiglia and Pinsoglio remaining with the Lega Pro side. Modena (loan) On 23 July 2013, however, Pinsoglio was sent on loan from Vicenza to Serie B side, Modena in exchange for the full registration rights of Angelo Di Stasio. Juventus return On 20 June 2014, Juventus announced that they had secured full ownership of Pinsoglio's contract for ‚Ç¨700,000, with Bianconi returned to Vicenza for ‚Ç¨600,000,Eight players under co-ownership sign new deals Juventus F.C.

Modena (loan) However, on 4 July 2014 Pinsoglio returned to Modena on a second season-long loan deal ahead of the 2014‚Äì15 Serie B season. Livorno (loan) On 3 August 2015 Pinsoglio was signed by A.S. Livorno Calcio, replacing Luca Mazzoni. In a vitally important relegation clash against Virtus Lanciano Pinsoglio single handedly threw away a two goal advantage, giving away a needless penalty and fumbling an easy cross at the feet on an opposing striker. Latina (loan) In July 2016 Pinsoglio and Pol Garcia were loaned to U.S. Latina Calcio from Juventus. Juventus debut On 19 May 2018, in the last match of the season, Pinsoglio made his Serie A and Juventus debut, coming on in the 64th minute of an eventual 2‚Äì1 home win against Hellas Verona to replace the club's starting goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon, who had made his final appearance for the club; Pinsoglio was beaten by Alessio Cerci in the 76th minute. The club celebrated winning the league title and a domestic double after the match. On 27 September 2018, Pinsoglio signed a two-year contract extension with Juventus, which would keep him at the club until June 2020. On 1 August 2020, he featured as a substitute for Wojciech Szczƒôsny in Juventus's 3‚Äì1 defeat to Roma in Serie A, with his club already confirmed as league champions. International career Pinsoglio has represented Italy at the U20 level. On 8 February 2011 he made his debut with the Italy U21 squad in a friendly game against England played in Empoli.

The theorem states that Hippias' trisectrix divides one of the sides of its associated square in a ratio of 2:\\\\pi . Arbitrary points on Hippias' trisectrix itself however cannot be constructed by circle and compass alone but only a dense subset.

It has local chapters in Oslo, Akershus, Troms√∏ and Bod√∏, and is initiating a fifth in Trondheim. By 2011, the organisation had more than 1,400 paying members, centred on students.The Verdens Gang newspaper reported that the organization is involved in the radicalization of the Muslim youths.Members of this organization have also joined ISIS.The organisation is under the surveillance of Norway Police Intelligence Agency PST and the organisation is banned from the established mosque community in Norway. Activities In 2010, Islam Net set out a \\"missionary expedition\\" to Nordkapp, Finnmarksvidda and Hammerfest, in order to \\"spread the message of the prophet Muhammad and solve misunderstandings about Islam.\\" Several Norwegians have converted to Islam at their meetings, and it runs a school in Oslo for new converts to Islam. Islam Net has received support for this position by the Muslim Student Society (Muslimsk Studentsamfunn) and Young Muslim (Ung Muslim). In 2010, the Oslo University College denied Islam Net free use of its rooms due to their position on hosting such meetings, but they have gotten the permission back as they have held events there afterward. The Islamnet's student Union is not allowed to register in the University of Oslo due to its Gender discrimination, gender segregated practices, attitudes toward the religious beliefs and sexual orientation discrimination. Controversy In 2013, the Fahad Qureshi created controversy by stating that Every Muslims support death penalty for homosexuals and stoning for adultery.He said this in a religious lecture promoted by Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) on the Internet.Qureshi allegedly expressed support for the Capital punishment and supposedly \\"argued\\" that the general majority of Muslims, regardless of their sect, approves of it.Norwegian Islamic Leader Fahad Qureshi: All Muslims Believe in the Death Penalty for Homosexuals, MEMRITV, Clip 4027 (transcript), May 19, 2013. (video clip available here) In response to such criticism, he spoke out to clarify his views publicly, admitting to having phrased himself in an imprecise manner and that he does not support the implementation of Islamic capital punishment in the West. On January 8, 2015, after the massacre of the Charlie Hebdo magazine in France, Qureshi, after condemning the attacks, tore apart a drawing from the magazine, stating that while Muslims do condemn the attacks, the magazine had abused freedom of speech to engage in the \\"bullying, scorn, [and] harassment\\" of Muslims by mocking the Prophet Muhammad.\\"Islam Net-leder rev i stykker Charlie Hebdo-tegning\\".

Links with Isis Many people from Norway who joined the Isis were members of Islamnet organisation. According to the Seierstad, Islam Net organisation was a catalyst in the radicalization of these girls. Islam Net organisation also had discussion arguing that Sept. 11 attacks is planned by Jews and the American government. Criticism The Muslim politician Abid Q Raja said that Islam Net can take Norway \\"into a dangerous direction, which is extreme and can radicalize young attitudes. They want to assume ownership of how Muslims should think and act.‚Äù The Muslim Politician Akhtar Chaudhry said that the speakers of Islamnet delivers extreme interpretations of Islam, that is not good.He said Muslims should interpret Islam with the democratic and humane values.

Jamal and Bibi Fatima on 5 May 1959 in a smallest village of Bhelahi in Saharsa district of Bihar. He finished his early education (Matriculation) from Islamia High School, Simri Bakhtiyarpur, Saharsa in 1974. He completed his higher Secondary in 1976. He graduated (B.A.) from Saharsa College, Saharsa in 1979. Later on, he moved to Patna to pursue Masters in Arts (M.A.) from Patna University in 1981. He held a PhD degree in Urdu from Patna University.Refer for validation He joined Parvati Science College in 1982 as a professor of Urdu. Political objective Inspired by the leadership and ideologies of Prameshwar Kunwar he was inclined towards politics from his early youth. His inspiration deepened after the famous JP movement. Being associated with the village, he was involved in the main issues and personally felt the basic needs of the poor people and the minority community. He always believed that they should be given an equal chance to grow, live and prosper on par with the other privileged people. He continuously strove for the upliftment of the backward and underprivileged section of the society. Secularism and Socialism were the two pillars of his politics. He was always seen as one of the cleanest politicians of the state. He was often referred as Gandhi of Kosi by his colleagues and followers. Political career He first contested on a Janata dal ticket from Mahishi Vidhan sabha and defeated the veteran congress leader and freedom fighter Lahtan Choudhary of Congress in 1995. In 1998 when the Janata Dal split due to the differences between Sharad Yadav and Lalu Prasad Yadav to form Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Janata Dal (United), he chose Lalu Prasad Yadav and joined RJD. He won convincingly in 2000 from an RJD ticket by a huge margin of approximately 20,000 votes defeating Surendra Yadav, an independent candidate. In the debacle and toppling of Lalu Yadav in 2005 election, he lost from Mahishi to Surendra Yadav marginally. The assembly could not be formed due to unclear mandate hence state was forced into fresh election. In the re-election he was asked to shift his constituency to Saharsa Vidhan Sabha Constituency. Accepting the party decision he contested from Saharsa in Oct 2005 election and lost to BJP's Sanjiv Jha by approximately 6000 votes. He worked hard and connected to the masses in the villages of his native assembly Mahishi and was determined to bounce back into the Bihar politics. His dedication and tireless effort was rewarded, and he was given back his home constituency of Mahishi in 2010 elections. Though Lalu Yadav's RJD was very badly defeated, he came victorious as the lone RJD candidate from the Koshi region defeating RajKumar sah of JD(U)by a margin of 1717 votes. Election 2015 Assumed to be a direct fight between the Grand alliance of RJD, JD(U) and INC, Vs NDA. RJD contested election on 101 Seats, JDU on 101, Congress on 41. Dr. Abdul Ghafoor once again contesting from the Mahishi seat defeated the nearest rival Chandan Kumar Sah by a comprehensive margin on 26,135 votes. This Victory would make Dr. Ghafoor the longest serving MLA from Mahishi. Grand Alliance got a Landslide victory by claiming 178 out of 243 seats while BJP+ managed a mere 58 seats. However, this alliance lasted only 20 months when Nitish Kumar resigned on 26 July 2017 at 5 PM following JD(U)'s remarriage to BJP and re-forming the government on 27 July 2017 at 10 AM Dr. Abdul Ghafoor was sworn in as the Minority Welfare ministerBihar Cabinet Ministers in the Nitish Kumar government on 20 November 2015.Bihar Vidhan Sabha He was in charge of the ministry until the resignation of Mr Nitish Kumar on 26 July 2017 following his breakaway from Mahagathbandhan and subsequent merger with NDA.

Location The Imatongs reach out from their highest central block around Mount Kinyeti into a northwestern, western and southwestern chain. The western chain, with peaks rising up to high, is usually known as the Acholi Mountains. The Kinyeti valley lies between the northwest and west ranges. The Kinyeti river, and others that drain the northern slopes of the mountains, feed the Badigeru swamps. These swamps, running in a SSW-NNE direction for , are discontinuous. They may be as wide as in the rainy season, but average in width. The swamps in turn may drain westward into the Bahr el Jebel section of the White Nile or eastward into the Veveno River. Colonial era The British colonial administration began a forestry project in the Kinyeti basin in the 1940s, clearing the natural forest and planting fast-growing softwoods, Cyprus and Pine. In 1950 the mountains above were made a forest reserve with no further settlement permitted, but the ban was not enforced during the civil wars. Forestry brought laborers into the mountains, and they started hillside farming in a wide area around the forest plantations. In 1949 fingerling trout supplied by the Kenya Game Department were put out in the upper Kinyeti River. By 1952 they had become established, and the forestry department was planning to stock other streams using trout from the Kinyeti. Later developments Shortly before independence, the government announced that the Army's Equatoria Corps was to be transferred to the North, sparking a mutiny on 18 August 1955. 336 northerners died and 75 southerners, of whom 55 drowned in the Kinyeti after they fled in panic from Torit. Forestry was neglected during the First Sudanese Civil War (1955-1972). After 1972 an effort was made to rehabilitate the plantations, with a new road built from Torit, a hydro- electric scheme developed to power sawmills and other changes. As of 1984 only the steepest slopes had natural forest and there were plans to clear-cut most of the Kinyeti basin. A 1981 feasibility study assessed hydroelectric power potential in the Kinyeti River and the local power demand, but there was no follow-up. The most promising site seemed to be at Katire.

It is part of the Roper Gulf Region local government area. At the , Barunga had a population of 313. In mid June each year, the Barunga Festival, a three-day event showcasing Australian Aboriginal culture, is held. At the 1988 event, the Barunga Statement, which requested a treaty between the Australian federal government and Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples), was presented to then Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Just before the 2018 Festival, the Barunga agreement was signed between the Northern Territory Government and all four land councils. History Tin Mine at Maranboy Aboriginal people have lived in Barunga and the surrounding region for thousands of years. Maranboy tin mine In September 1913, a goldfield named Maranboy was declared for a period of two years. Maranboy was located from where Barunga is today. Tin was discovered at Maranboy in 1913 by prospectors Scharber and Richardson. Tin mines and a battery were operational in the same year. Prospectors of European, Chinese and Aboriginal descent worked at Maranboy. The mine closed in 1949 for repairs but never reopened. Many of the Aboriginal people who serviced the mine returned to Beswick Creek. Bamyili Town Council Plane crash nearby A Douglas DC-3 belonging to the Dutch Air Force crash-landed near Beswick Creek or Beswick (now Wugularr) in 1947. All passengers survived, with four crew travelling about down the Katherine River to get help. After running out of food they killed one of two dogs they had with them. The wings were eventually removed and the remains of the plane were towed to Katherine. Tandangal The Tandangal Native Settlement (from Jawoyn language dangdangdal), also known as the Eight Mile Settlement, was established in 1947, located about from Beswick Station. The local people were not consulted about the choice of location nor the method of their removal to the settlement from the King River Compound. In 1948, the Beswick community moved to Tandangal (sometimes known as \\"old Bamyili\\"), because of risk of flooding from recent heavy rains. An influenza epidemic spread through the community in May 1951. In June 1951 the people were relocated to the new site, initially known as Beswick Creek Native Settlement, and Tandangal was condemned. Back to Beswick By November 1951 the 'flu had killed seven people. In early 1951, the Northern Territory Government started to develop the Beswick Creek community, building basic housing infrastructure and creating some minor employment opportunities. Local farmers also employed Aboriginal people, even running a peanut farm at Beswick Creek. The farm only lasted a few years. As Beswick grew, new groups formed a camp on the other side of the river known as \\"The Compound\\" where the people made humpies. 1950s to present The Barunga school was first opened in 1954 with 42 children enrolled. The elders changed the name of \\"The Compound\\" to Bamyili in 1965. In 1984, it changed its name to Barunga. Australian cycling champion Cadel Evans spent his early childhood in Barunga, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1985 the Barunga Festival was first held. In 1988, the Barunga Statement was presented to the Prime Minister at the event. (See below for detail.) Barunga Festival Bangardi Robert Lee (1852‚Äì2005), a leader of the Bagala clan of the Jawoyn people, initiated the Barunga Sport and Cultural Festival in 1985. It became an important forum for sharing ideas, showcasing the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander cultures and talent, and to engage with social and political issues. It has become an annual music and cultural celebration, held on the Queen's Birthday long weekend (second weekend) in June. It features a program of workshops, dancing ceremonies, traditional bush tucker-gathering, didgeridoo-making, basket weaving and musical performances and sport. The Barunga Statement (1988) In 1988, as part of Bicentennial celebrations, the Prime Minister of Australia Bob Hawke visited the Northern Territory for the Barunga Festival, where he was presented with a statement of Aboriginal political objectives by Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Wenten Rubuntja. Painted on a 1.2 metre square sheet of composite wood, it became known as the \\"Barunga Statement\\". It stated: Prime Minister Hawke responded by saying that he wished to conclude a treaty between Aboriginal and other Australians by 1990, but his wish was not fulfilled. Controversy erupted over the exposure of sacred material in the bark painting, leading some Indigenous leaders to call for its return. Some leaders alleged the presentation of the painting resulted in at least ten deaths due to \\"munya\\", which translates as remorse in the Aboriginal system of payback. In 1991, Hawke's last act as Prime Minister was to hang the Barunga Statement at Parliament House, Canberra. He did so one minute before Paul Keating was sworn in as the new Prime Minister, stating \\"its presence here calls on those who follow me, it demands of them that they continue efforts that they find solutions to the abundant problems that still face the Aboriginal people of this country\\". Yothu Yindi song Treaty In June 1991 Australian Aboriginal band, Yothu Yindi, wrote and released the hit song \\"Treaty\\" to commemorate the statement. Lead singer Mandawuy Yunupingu, with his older brother Galarrwuy, wanted to highlight the lack of progress on the treaty between Aboriginal peoples and the Federal Government. Mandawuy said: > \\"Bob Hawke visited the Territory. He went to this gathering in Barunga. And > this is where he made a statement that there shall be a treaty between black > and white Australia. Sitting around the camp fire, trying to work out a > chord to the guitar, and around that camp fire, I said, \\"Well, I heard it on > the radio. And I saw it on the television.\\" That should be a catchphrase. > And that's where 'Treaty' was born\\". The Barunga agreement (2018) On 8 June 2018, just before the opening of the Barunga Festival, the Northern Territory Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), since known as the Barunga agreement, to begin talks with all four of the Territory's Aboriginal land councils, on the subject of a treaty. The agreement, which was drafted after a week of discussions which included about 200 elected members of the land councils, included some guiding principles, including that ‚ÄúAboriginal people were the prior owners and occupiers of the land, seas and waters that are now called the NT of Australia‚Äù. The land councils involved are the Northern, Central, Anindilyakwa and Tiwi Land Councils. One of the essential elements was seen as truth telling, ‚ÄúTruth telling is critical. Unless we understand each other, and understand how we‚Äôve been impacted even by the best intentions of the other side, it‚Äôs pretty hard to construct a new relationship‚Äù. The only two surviving senior men of the nine who painted the Barunga statement in 1988, Rirratjingu clan leader Galarrwuy Yunupingu and fellow Yolngu leader Djambawa Marawili, were present on Friday as the treaty agreement was signed.

It was known in the USA by the alternative title Assassin in Love. The film premiered at the 2007 Tremblant Film Festival, where Lewis was awarded Best Director. Plot Milo (Damian Lewis) is a dissatisfied professional assassin. Cornering his latest target at his home, Milo has a change of heart and offers the man the chance to escape and assume a new identity, only for Bjorn (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), a rival assassin working for the same organization, to arrive and kill the man anyway. Bjorn makes it clear that he plans to use Milo's lapse in protocol to have his bosses order Milo's termination; they do so, assigning the kill to Bjorn. Milo narrowly escapes Bjorn's first attack, and after a conversation with his fellow assassin and friend Leo (Michael Gambon) heads to Leo's country property in Gwynfyd (actually Grosmont, Monmouthshire), Wales to hide out while Leo works on making things safe for Milo. When attempting to bury his gun case, Milo is knocked out by the remains of an exploding sheep, detonated by the unseen Eggs (Dyfan Dwyfor), a young conspiracy theorist who steals Milo's weapons while he is unconscious. The unconscious Milo is found and taken home by Rhiannon (Kate Ashfield), local vet and part-time barmaid, who ensures he's healthy before returning him to his car. In the pub Milo meets landlord Bryn Morgan (Steve Spiers), who mistakes Milo for the village's new baker, as Leo's property is the former bakery. Not wanting to raise suspicion Milo goes along with this, and adopts the alias \\"Milo Shakespeare\\", inspired by a bust of William Shakespeare he notices on the bar. Milo stays in hiding while Bjorn attempts to track his location using a photo of the bakery left behind by Milo. With Leo's efforts taking time, Milo commits to learning to bake to fit with his inadvertent cover identity. However, unbeknownst to him, Eggs has correctly (if illogically) concluded that Milo is really an assassin, but erroneously assumes that the bakery is a front for his assassination business. Before long the rumor has spread throughout most of village, save for Rhiannon and a few others. Believing the rumor, local fish and chip shop owner Rhys Edwards (Anthony O'Donnell) comes to Milo and asks him to \\"bake a cake\\" for his domineering wife Martha (Annette Badland), Milo completely missing the intended subtext. The next day, Rhys unknowingly leaves a gas burner open and unlit before he leaves for work, and Martha is killed by the ensuing explosion when she goes to use the toaster. Gwynfyd's residents assume Milo was responsible, proving the rumors true in their minds. Over the next weeks Milo's business picks up considerably, with several people ordering \\"cakes\\" for others in town. Eggs has started working for Milo as his assistant, wanting to become an assassin himself. One night Milo prepares for a date with Rhiannon, while Eggs prepares for a \\"date\\" with Bob (Brian Hibbard), a local man in dispute with his neighbor Stan (Robert Page) over the annual \\"best garden\\" award. Eggs arrives at Bob's house as he eats dinner and, nearly losing his nerve, fires a silenced shot into the house blindly. When Bob clutches his stomach in agony Eggs panics and flees. Milo's date with Rhiannon goes well, but is interrupted when Eggs arrives, drunk and distraught over his first murder, though he passes out before he can explain. Milo and Rhiannon take the unconscious Eggs back to the bakery, then have sex. Afterward, Eggs regains consciousness and explains what happened to Milo, who is stunned to realize the pleasant townsfolk who visited his bakery were actually ordering assassinations on each other. Rhiannon overhears the conversation and leaves, angry; Milo later tries to apologize for his past and not telling her sooner, but is rebuffed. The next day Milo prepares to leave town, only to see Rhys fleeing the chip shop, stripped to his underwear and covered in various condiments; Milo and Eggs follow him to the pub. After a brief interruption at the arrival of Bob, who explains to a stunned Eggs that he merely burned his stomach when something knocked his hot dinner onto it, Rhys tells Milo and the rest of the town that a blond man - Bjorn - tortured him for information on Milo, and has now kidnapped Rhiannon to draw Milo out. Milo explains the truth behind Martha's death and his ignorance of their intent when placing cake orders with him to the now-ashamed townsfolk, then goes on to say that he wanted to get away from his life as an assassin and vows to rescue Rhiannon. He burns the list of \\"cake\\" orders in front of the townsfolk, explaining that \\"everyone deserves a second chance\\". Milo confronts Bjorn, who reveals that his hatred of Milo stems from him rejecting Bjorn's desire to run away together with him, which Milo reminds him, not for the first time, \\"is not possible for so many reasons.\\" Milo challenges Bjorn to fight \\"properly\\" rather than just killing Rhiannon; the two duel with foils, which seems to reach a climax until they discover the weapons are safety- tipped and unable to wound. They then switch to staves, which quickly break, then hand-to-hand, where Milo bests Bjorn. As Milo goes to free Rhiannon, Bjorn pulls a gun, but stops when the townsfolk appear and surround him, demanding he release \\"our baker\\". After some talking Bjorn finally decides to leave Milo be in the hope that Rhiannon will break his heart, whereupon Eggs knocks him out with a shovel. Some time later Milo is preparing a cake at the bakery, assisted by Eggs who has developed skills as a pastrycook, eclipsing Milo's own. Leo arrives while Milo is alone in the kitchen; he explains that he used Milo's exile as an opportunity to stage a \\"hostile takeover\\" of the company, and as he is now in charge Milo is free to return to work without fear of being killed. To Leo's surprise Milo turns him down, saying he intends to remain a baker and will pay him a fair price for the shop. Leo is confused until he sees Rhiannon enter the shop, and leaves silently when Milo steps away to greet her. The two then go out to greet the entire village, there to enjoy the grand opening of Milo's bakery, \\"Shakespeare's Cake\\".

It was directed by Guy Green and stars Peter van Eyck, Betta St. John and Mandy Miller. It was the first starring role for Miller.  Plot  Paul Decker kills his wife, Madge, by drugging her and then gassing her in a room in their Italian villa, sealing all the windows and doors but concealing himself under floorboards in the room, covered by a rug and using a snorkel attached to air pipes to breathe while hidden. Household servants discover her body in the morning and as the room has been locked and sealed from the inside, it appears to the local Italian police Inspector and British Consulate Mr. Wilson to be a case of suicide, although no suicide note has been found. Madge's teenage daughter Candy arrives from England with her dog Toto and travelling companion Jean Edwards, and immediately accuses her stepfather, Decker, of killing her mother, based on the fact that she believes - correctly - that he also killed her father years before and made it look like an accident. Toto senses Decker's presence under the floorboards but is not taken any notice of. It is suggested that Candy and Jean go to America where Decker will join them later, but Candy is determined to investigate further; she goes to Decker's room to look for evidence, but it is Toto that finds the snorkel but again Candy does not recognise its importance and puts it back in a wardrobe. When Decker finds Candy in the room she leaves shortly afterwards, but Toto again finds the snorkel and Decker realises that the dog is proving a problem and poisons him; Candy again senses the truth and accuses Decker of killing her dog, which he denies. Decker, Jean and Candy go on a beach picnic, and Candy, seeing a man swimming with a snorkel, starts to realise how her mother's murder was carried out; when she then swims out too far, Decker swims out to her, pretending to save her but in reality hoping to drown her and make it look like an accident, but before he can do so Jean also swims out and he gives up on the idea, although again Candy knows what he was trying to do. Decker decides that he will have to kill Candy, and, establishing an alibi as before, lures her to the villa by telling her that he has found his wife's suicide note and has asked the police Inspector to come over as well. He 'reads' Madge's suicide note to Candy and encourages her to drink a drugged glass of milk; by the time she realises that he has made up the story she is too drowsy and Decker continues to carry out his plan, hiding under the floorboards and the rug as before. This time however Wilson and Jean arrive in time and rescue Candy, although they refuse to believe her story that Decker was trying to kill her, believing her to be unbalanced following her mother's death. She insists that they search the room thoroughly, including moving a heavy cabinet out from the wall, but finally agrees to leave with them. As they leave Decker attempts to come out from his place of concealment, but the cabinet is now over the rug and he can't get out. Candy decides to go back one more time to the room, where she hears Decker calling out for help, and realises what has happened.

He and I had a great time casting the smaller roles.\\" The film was the first starring vehicle for actress Mandy Miller; Green described her as \\"...a natural talent and a very professional girl, but a bit too mature for the part, and all our efforts failed to disguise this.\\" Of star Peter van Eyck, Green said that \\"he had to do a lot of difficult swimming and, one day after spending most of the morning manfully keeping up with a motorboat from which he was being photographed, Peter said, 'You never asked me if I could swim before giving me the part.' It was true. I didn't.\\" The budget on The Snorkel was about 20 percent above the average Hammer Films shoot, due to the extensive location photography (the Italian villa used in the movie was located in Alassio, Liguria's riviera). The film was reportedly produced without a distribution deal in place. Hammer Films: An Exhaustive Filmography claims that an agreement with Warner Bros. had fallen through and Hammer executive James Carreras (father of producer Michael) only later struck a deal with Columbia Pictures for both The Snorkel and its co-feature in a double-bill, The Camp on Blood Island. The film's story, credited to '\\"Anthony Dawson\\", has sometimes been attributed to Italian Horror director Antonio Margheriti, who often used the anglicised pseudonym \\"Anthony Dawson.\\" In 2010, however, Margheriti's son denied his father was involved with the production, stating that he did not begin using the name \\"Anthony Dawson\\" until 1960. It seems likely that the true author of The Snorkel's story was actor Anthony Dawson, who also appeared in Hammer's Curse of the Werewolf. The film had its premier aboard the luxury liner Queen Elizabeth, during a crossing of the Atlantic in May 1958.  Reception  In The New York Times, critic Richard W. Nason offered lukewarm praise for the film, writing that, \\"Hammer Films apparently has become proficient in the manufacture of motion pictures that are not greatly distinguished but that nonetheless manage to be more absorbing than the usual low-budget program film.... because of the competence of the direction, acting and particularly the editing, the audience is kept awake throughout the running of the twin bill. This is no mean achievement, when you consider the number of ho-hum melodramas that flow from the world's film factories every year... Anyone who wonders how a simple skin-diving snorkel can be used this way will have to see the film... And, once you think about it, it's a very silly way to do away with somebody. Both [this film and its double-bill, The Camp on Blood Island,] are for those who are looking to kill time.\\" Glenn Erickson of DVDTalk also offered mix praise, calling van Eyck's character \\"underdeveloped but menacing,\\" and noting that, \\"Mandy Miller's likeable teen heroine is a doubtful mix of immature emotions and steely resolve, as shown in one poorly handled scene when Candy underreacts to the death of her beloved dog.\\" However, he goes on to write, \\"The film's good reputation comes from fans that admire the killer's technically elaborate murder scheme, and ace Hammer cameraman Jack Asher's arresting camerawork. A final surprise lifted from The Third Man could have provided a perfect shock finish, but the movie goes on a bit longer, clearly to tie up some moral loose ends for the censors.\\" John M. Miller, writing for Turner Classic Movies, was more positive: \\"The Snorkel opens with one of the more memorable pre-credits sequences to be found in a thriller...While not a classic, this clever and twisted thriller, as well as Peter van Eyck's chilling performance, is overdue for greater exposure.\\" References External links * Category:1958 films Category:British films Category:British thriller films Category:1950s thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Guy Green Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Hammer Film Productions films Category:Films with screenplays by Jimmy Sangster ","title":"The Snorkel"},{"id":"32567001","text":"Asker Jeukendrup is a sports nutrition scientist and an Ironman triathlete.

Remaining there he edited two newspapers and became well known as a lawyer, poet and wit. Early life In 1792, Henry Peard Driscoll was born in Dublin. He was a son of Timothy Driscoll (1760-1835) K.C., \\"for many years known on the Munster circuit as a barrister of considerable practice,\\" and his wife Mary Ann Campbell (d. 1816), daughter of the Rev. Dr John Campbell (1724-1772) B.A., LL.B., LL.D., of Newgarden House; Vicar-General of Tuam, Co. Galway. His first cousins included Mrs Richard Graves and Lt.-Col. Joseph Netterville Burton, the father of Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton and Lady Stisted, wife of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. Also on his mother's side, he was related to the first cousins Sir William Collis Meredith, 2nd Chief Justice of Quebec, and Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, briefly the Governor-General of Nova Scotia. In 1806, Driscoll entered Trinity College, Dublin. After graduating, he chose a military career and was commissioned as an Ensign into the 2nd Battalion of the 67th (South Hampshire) Regiment of Foot, going with them to Spain. The battalion saw little action, spending most of its time guarding the garrison at Cartagena. Military service At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Driscoll received a Lieutenancy in the newly formed 99th/100th Regiment and came to Canada. The regiment was sent to the frontier on the Niagara Peninsula and participated in most of the actions fought there, performing a brilliant feat of arms by the surprise and capture of Fort Niagara in the winter of 1813. At the Battle of Chippewa his regiment suffered heavy losses. In 1817, Lieutenant Driscoll was court-martialled at Montreal and discharged from the British army \\"for having falsely, calumniously, and maliciously traduced the character of his commanding officer, Brevet Major John Martin\\" in an address he gave before Lt.-General Sir Gordon Drummond at the conclusion of the war in 1814.Court Martial of Lieut. Henry Driscoll, 1818 Legal career Driscoll remained in Montreal, where he studied for the bar in the offices of Denis-Benjamin Viger. At the same time as his studies, he edited the Herald newspaper while living on Rue Saint-Paul, and in 1819 he was the editor of the Courant too. In May 1823, Driscoll was called to the Bar of Lower Canada. He got on rapidly, gaining the reputation of being a clever, eloquent and witty lawyer. He was invited to run for Parliament at Carleton County, Upper Canada, where many of his old regiment had been granted land, but declined. In time, he took silk and was for a long time Crown Prosecutor in the Criminal Terms. The future 4th Chief Justice of Quebec, Sir Francis Godschall Johnson, articled under him from 1834 to 1836. He saw active service during the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837-38, and as a favourite of Lord Durham, he was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the volunteers. In 1840, he was appointed police magistrate, and a seat on the Bench lay before him. But, his levity of character, coupled with an irritable and sensitive spirit led him to quarrels, and duels, with many of his legal contemporaries, notably Judges Aylwin and Holland. Those who suffered from a sense of professional inferiority to the quick-tempered old Irishman, and the lash of his wit, did all they could to disparage him and point out his weaknesses, but in the end it was his disregard of public opinion that precluded him from becoming a judge, to which his talents clearly entitled him. On his death, except for C√¥me-S√©raphin Cherrier, he was the oldest serving member of his profession in Montreal. Driscoll had many good qualities, the chief of which was benevolence, which he often carried to excess, \\"in the manner of poor Oliver Goldsmith\\"; and like that benevolent person, Driscoll was improvident and died poor. Though remembered as a great lawyer, Henry Driscoll had all the talents to attain high position and true lasting memory, but he threw away his opportunities. A strange peculiarity about him was that he did not like his own countrymen, and too frequently decried them.Obituary of Henry Driscoll, 1869 Poet and wit Driscoll was possessed of a great wit and talent with words. He was affectionately known among his many admirers as \\"Grin-Chuckle\\", and everyone expected a bon mot or a pun from him. His epigrams were very pungent, and many of his witty sayings were remembered long after his death by the old citizens of Montreal. He was also an apt poet, and if all his epigrams and satires, etc., were collected, they would have made a good-sized volume, entitling him to a place among the poets of Canada. He died at his home, 16 Barclay Street, Montreal, on October 28, 1869. He was survived by at least two illegitimate sons - Netterville Driscoll, Barrister of Montreal, and the jovial Alfred Driscoll (1830-1893), of Aylmer; Prothonotary of Ottawa.True Witness & Catholic Church Chronicle, 1893 References Works *Capture of Fort Niagara, by Lieutenant Henry Driscoll, 1814 Category:1792 births Category:1869 deaths Category:Lawyers in Quebec Category:People from Dublin (city) ","title":"Henry Pearce Driscoll"},{"id":"32567108","text":"Alison Parson (born c. 1984) is an American country singer and songwriter based in Nashville, Tennessee.Female Country Artists Country & Western Music Singers & Stars.

He most recently served defensive backs coach for the New York Giants and as the head coach for the Texas State Bobcats. Withers served as head football coach at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during the 2011 season as well as James Madison University in the 2014 and 2015 seasons. Early years Withers was born in Charlotte, North Carolina on June 15, 1963. He attended West Charlotte High School and later attended Appalachian State University for college, graduating in 1985. He was a standout defensive back for the Mountaineers and a captain. Coaching career Withers started his coaching career at Austin Peay State University as the defensive coordinator in 1988. He then proceeded to coach wide receivers and special teams at Austin Peay before moving on to coach outside linebackers at Tulane University in 1991. A year later he went to the University of Southern Mississippi to coach defensive backs. Withers then moved to the National Football League (NFL), joining the New Orleans Saints as a defensive quality controller in 1994. He then took the job of defensive coordinator at the University of Louisville, serving from 1995 to 1997. He then joined the University of Texas at Austin coaching staff as the defensive backs coach in 1998. In 2001, he went back to the NFL to take the job of defensive backs coach of the Tennessee Titans. In 2007, he took the job of defensive coordinator at the University of Minnesota. He then took the defensive coordinator job at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) in 2008. He was promoted to interim head coach from the defensive coordinator position after Butch Davis was fired on July 27, 2011. Coaching successes Withers has made accomplishments at several of his coaching stops, both college and the NFL. While he was the defensive backs coach of the Titans, they achieved a top ten defensive ranking in 2002, his first season with the Titans. From 2002 to 2004, the Titans grabbed 57 interceptions, the best ever for a three-year span for the franchise, fourth best in the AFC and eighth best in the NFL. The Titans tallied 21 picks in 2004, with 16 coming from the Withers coached secondary. In his first year with the Tar Heels, his defense totaled 20 interceptions, one shy of the school record for interceptions in a year. 2009 was an elite year for Withers's defense as they ranked sixth in total defense in the nation. They ranked 10th against the run, 13th in scoring defense and 14th in pass defense. The UNC defense was the only defense in the nation that was ranked in the top 15 in total yards allowed, scoring defense, run defense, pass defense, pass-efficiency defense, third down defense and tackles for loss. The Carolina defense totaled 19 interceptions and set an ACC record with 508 interception return yards. In 2010, the Tar Heels matched their interception total of 2009 with 19 picks. The Heels also ranked fourth in the ACC and 30th nationally in defense, even with injuries that made Withers play a different lineup every game. During the three total years that Withers was defensive coordinator of the Tar Heels, they totaled 58 interceptions. Scandal at UNC Withers was named head coach for the 2011 season at UNC on July 28, 2011 after it was announced that Butch Davis had been fired following a scandal that involved improper benefits to players from an agent, excessive parking tickets accumulated by players, overuse of a tutor, plagiarism, and other violations that resulted in sanctions, including a two-year probation, a reduction of scholarships and the vacation of 16 wins from the 2008 and 2009 seasons. Withers was identified as declining to help in the university-chartered Wainstein investigation that took place after his coaching tenure at the school had ended. 2011 season With Withers leading the Tar Heels as the new head coach the 2011 season got started with many distractions. The Tar Heels beat their first opponent, FCS school James Madison University 42‚Äì10. Bryn Renner set the single game school record for completion percentage at 95.7%. The Heels then beat Rutgers University 24‚Äì22, holding the Scarlet Knights to one total yard rushing and 244 yards overall. The week after, the South's Oldest Rivalry was resumed, as Carolina beat the University of Virginia 28‚Äì17. UNC rushed for 222 total yards for an average of 5.4 yards per carry. The Heels then traveled to Atlanta to play #25 Georgia Tech, dropping this one 35‚Äì28. Georgia Tech had 312 yards rushing and 496 yards total on the day. Next the Heels played East Carolina University beating them 35‚Äì20. The Heels then proceeded to beat the University of Louisville 14‚Äì7. Giovani Bernard became the first Tar Heel rusher in 27 years to rush for over 100 yards in four straight games. Bernard extended his streak of 100 yard rushing games to five in UNC's 30‚Äì24 loss to University of Miami. The Heels recovered an onside kick with under a minute to go, but time ran out before they could score. The Heels then traveled to Clemson University to face the Tigers, losing 59‚Äì38. It was the second most points given up by the Tar Heels in their 405 ACC games, trailing only the 63 given up in a game against Florida State University in 2000. The next game was the Homecoming game for the Heels, and they beat Wake Forest University 49‚Äì24. UNC racked up 506 total yards and caught four interceptions in the game. Next up for the Heels was the rivalry game with North Carolina State University in Raleigh, which the Heels lost 13‚Äì0. It was the fifth straight loss to the Wolfpack, the first shutout in the series since 1960. Giovani Bernard did break the 1,000 yard rushing mark for the season, but as a team the Heels were held to three total yards rushing. On a Thursday night in Blacksburg, Virginia the Heels lost to Virginia Tech 24‚Äì21. Dwight Jones passed the 1,000 yard receiving mark for the season, making the 2011 Tar Heels the first team to have a 1,000 yard receiver and rusher in the same season. UNC closed out the regular season with a home win over arch-rival Duke University, winning 37‚Äì21. The Heels have won the last 20 of 21 games in the series and hold an all time advantage of 58‚Äì35‚Äì4.

Barlowe and Philip Amadas departed England with two ships on April 27, sailing down to the Canary Islands and then on to the West Indies, where they stopped briefly for food and water before sailing north along the eastern coast of Florida. After eleven days they came to shallow water and smelled \\"so sweet, and so strong a smell, as if we had been in the midst of some delicate garden,\\" indicating that land was nearby. Two days later (July 4), they saw the coast and continued to sail for 120 miles until they could find an entrance or river going in from the sea. They finally landed on the outer banks of what is now the Pamlico Sound of North Carolina. Barlowe described the land as a place where \\"in all the world the like abundance is not to be found....\\" He and his crew were met by a large group of the Secotan tribe, led by their king's brother Granganimeo. Their king Wingina was unable to be there because of a leg wound sustained during a battle with a neighboring tribe. Several of the natives accompanied them as they sailed north to Roanoke island. There they found a Secotan village, where, according to Barlowe, they were treated with great hospitality and generosity. Barlowe described the people of the village as \\"gentle, loving and faithful, void of all guile and treason, and such as live after the manner of the golden age.\\"Broadview Anthology of British Literature, Volume Two: The Renaissance and the Early Seventeenth Century.

He is adept at adapting the ancient music of Japan, China, Persia, Greece and medieval Europe to create a new and original music without abandoning their strict forms, while simultaneously making them relevant to contemporary music styles. He has composed for classical ensembles including string quartets, piano, various chamber ensembles and orchestra, as well as composed, produced and performed with rock, jazz and musicians of various traditional music from around the world. He has also composed many music theater pieces, some of which has been released on CD in the United States and Japan. Biography Ayuo Takahashi was born in Tokyo, and spent his early childhood traveling in Germany, Sweden and France with his parents. His father, Yuji Takahashi, is a composer of contemporary classical music and a pianist known for premiering works by Iannis Xenakis and John Cage. Ayuo and his parents settled in New York City in 1966. Ayuo grew up listening to both the new avant-garde experimental and contemporary music and the psychedelic rock music of the 1960s. He often went to museums, art galleries and cinemas to see exhibitions of contemporary art and the new cinema. At the same time, he also saw Japanese traditional Noh plays, and heard ancient and medieval music from Japan and Europe. All these were to be become important influences in Ayuo's music and music-theater pieces. Ayuo's parents divorced in 1969, and Ayuo's mother married an Iranian- American, who came from a family that performed traditional Persian music in the courts of the Iranian Shah. This gave Ayuo the opportunity to hear Persian traditional music, which was also to leave a lasting influence on his music. In 1975, Ayuo's mother and step-father separated, while Ayuo was visiting his father in Japan, forcing him to live there. His first studio recording was in 1976 with his father, Yuji Takahashi, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Masahiko Togashi on the CD \\"Twilight\\" released on Columbia Records in Japan. Adjusting to life in Japan as a teenager was difficult, and Ayuo would later make that the main theme on his CD \\"What We Look Like In The Picture\\" released in 2006 from Zipangu in Japan. Ayuo spent his high school years writing poetry and appearing in poetry reading competitions. Ayuo joined Keiji Haino's group \\"Fushitsusha\\" in 1979, and performed improvisation with many musicians in what was the final period of the \\"free music scene\\" in Japan of the 1970s. Ayuo studied the traditional plucked string instrument, Biwa, with Kinshi Tsuruta. He studied contemporary music composition with Minao Shibata and Joji Yuasa. His first solo record,\\"Carmina\\", was recorded in 1983 and released in 1984 from Epic-Sony. Since then, he has released over a dozen solo albums, collaborating with a diverse group of individuals, including Peter Hammill, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Danny Thompson, Maddy Prior, Takehisa Kosugi, Carlos Alomar, John Zorn, Bill Laswell, Dave Mattacks, Yohji Yamamoto, Jadranka Stojakoviƒá, Hiromi ≈åta, Yoko Ueno, Clive Deamer, Mikigami Koichi, Wataru Ohkuma, Aki Takahashi, Mie Miki, Kazue Sawai and many Japanese traditional musicians. Three CDs of his music have been released in the United States from the TZADIK label in the 21st century. Ayuo has composed music for films, ballet, contemporary dance, and theater. \\"Border Line\\", directed by the Korean- Japanese film director, Lee Sang-il in 2002, features music mostly performed alone by Ayuo. Music Ayuo has a unique distinctive style in his music. He can create music which balances on traditions of world music, improvisation, new age, psychedelic, avant-pop, electronica and classical composition, without losing his distinctive voice in the music he creates. For the first Tzadik CD, he was introduced as the \\"one of the most enigmatic figures in Japan\\". He has also made unique arrangements of compositions by Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Richard Wagner, Maurice Ravel, Toru Takemitsu and other classical composers Lyrics Ayuo's lyrics are often about difficulties in human relationship, especially between different cultures, and between men and women. His lyrics often include scientific, literary or historical references. He often uses texts by philosophers from Japan, Middle East, and Europe, such as Dogen, Rumi, Kazantzakis, and others. Two of his music-theater compositions are based on a medieval Japanese Noh play by Zeami. Another music-theater composition is based on the story \\"Blue Eyes, Black Hair\\" by Marguerite Duras. There are also compositions based on mythic themes, such as the story of Pele and Hi'iaka from Hawaii, and story of the Sun god from ancient India. Ayuo often writes on the liner notes of his CDs that he was influenced by the scholar of world myths and comparative religion, Joseph Campbell.

His date of birth was 18 August 1943. He is a graduate of the British Army's Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. General Opande was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in graduating from Sandhurst in 1964. General Opande is also a graduate of the British Army's Staff College, Camberley and the U.S. National Defense University at Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington DC. General Opande served as Deputy Force Commander with the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group in Namibia (UNTAG) from 1989 to 1990. Before serving as UNTAG DFC, he had been the Kenyan Army's director of operations. He represented the Kenyan government in the negotiation of the Mozambique peace process from 1990 to 1993. He then was sent to Liberia as the Chief Military Observer of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 2000, General Opande appears to have filled posts in Kenya, and likely served as Commandant of the National Defence College, Kenya's highest military institution, during that period. In 1998, General Opande, listed in Chinese sources as president of the Institute for National Defence, visited the People's Republic of China.China.org.cn, FOCAC Member States: Kenya In 2000, General Opande was serving as Kenya's Vice-Chief of General Staff.http://lists.sn.apc.org/pipermail/pol.ethiopia/2001-June/000723.html He was appointed as Force Commander of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) in November 2000. He served as UNAMSIL Force Commander until 2003. In a letter to the UN Security Council dated 29 September 2003, the UN Secretary-General advised that Opande was to be appointed Force Commander of the newly established United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). General Opande said in early 2004 that communications between the three UN peacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and C√¥te d'Ivoire were quite good, and that the contact permitted exchanges of ideas at the highest level. He served as UNMIL Force Commander from 2003 to 2005. After that point, he appears to have retired. General Opande commented upon the establishment of the United States Africa Command in June 2008.

The Global Mayors‚Äô Forum is divided into several conference sessions, forum sessions and meetings. These various sessions have different focuses but are all related to the theme of the GMF for that year. For each conference a new host city is selected by the GMF Council. History Planning for the first Global Mayors‚Äô Forum began in 2005 after many months of consideration. The goal of the Global Mayors‚Äô Forum was to transcend national and institutional barriers by bring together participants from the public and private sectors. Additionally participants would be recruited from around the globe in order to bring together participants from disparate geographic areas. The GMF council met for the first time in 2008 to discuss and plan the GMF 2009. The inaugural GMF was to be held in Hong Kong in 2009 but this conference was called off due to the H1N1 epidemic. In 2010 Zhuhai's was named as the host city for the 2011 and 2012 GMF conferences. Global Mayors' Forum 2011 The theme for the GMF 2011 is ‚ÄúRoad to Rio +20‚Äù in reference to the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Like the Rio +20 conference, the GMF 2011 will be focused on sustainable development and the development of a green economy. The GMF 2011 will be held in Zhuhai, China. This city was selected by the five organizing institutions to host the 2011 GMF for its unique history and sustainable development practices. Zhuhai was one of the first Chinese cities to be designated a Special Economic Zone in 1979.Zhuhai Government website As a result of embracing the challenges of modernization, Zhuhai has grown from a small village to a major economic and transportation hub. Zhuhai will host all sessions of the Global Mayors‚Äô Forum 2011, including the China Sustainable Development Forum and the Six-Party Forum.  China Sustainable Development Forum  The GMF 2011 will begin with the China Sustainable Development Forum which is to be hosted by the Chinese Society for Sustainable Development (CSSD). The topic of this forum is sustainable development in the People‚Äôs Republic of China. One of the keynote speeches will be given by Madam Deng Nan, former vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission and daughter of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.  Six-Party Forum  The feature form of the GMF 2011 is the Six-Party Forum. The six parties refer to participants and attendees from six different fields, namely: *government officials *non-governmental officials *business leaders/entrepreneurs *scholars/academics *student representatives *the global press. The six party forums is co-hosted by the International Mayor Communication Centre and the Chinese Society for Sustainable Development. Due to CSSD‚Äôs consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the results of this forum will be reported to ECOSOC for consideration during the Rio +20 Conference in Rio de Janeiro. Global Mayors' Forum 2012 As part of Zhuhai's winning bid they also received the right to host the 2012 Global Mayors forum. This forum does not yet have an official theme or date. The Global Mayors' Forum 2012 will feature the Mayors' Forum.  Mayors‚Äô Forum  The Mayors‚Äô Forum was set up for all the mayors and governors attending the GMF 2011.

Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors. During the Islamic Golden Period from the 8th century until the 15th century there were many Muslim women who were inventors and engineers, such as the 10th-century astronomer Mariam al-Asturlabi.Salim Al-Hassani. \\"Women's Contribution to Classical Islamic Civilisation: Science, Medicine and Politics\\". Retrieved January 5, 2019. In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science, although many of them were still not eligible to graduate with a degree in engineering, such as Ada Lovelace or Hertha Marks Ayrton. Rita de Morais Sarmento was one of the first women in Europe to be certified with an academic degree in engineering in 1896. In the United States at the University of California, Berkeley, however, both Elizabeth Bragg (1876) and Julia Morgan (1894) already had received their bachelor's degree in that field. In the early years of the 20th century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts. Alice Perry (1906), C√©cile Butticaz (1907), and Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu (1912) were some of the first European to graduate with a degree in engineering. The entry of the United States into World War II created a serious shortage of engineering talent in America as men were drafted into the armed forces. The GE on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program had \\"Curtiss-Wright Cadettes\\" (\\"Engineering Cadettes\\", e.g., Rosella Fenton). The company partnered with Cornell, Penn State, Purdue, the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, RPI, and Iowa State University to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.Bix, Amy Sue, \\"'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation.\\" IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21. Kathleen McNulty (1921‚Äì2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the ENIAC. Georgia Tech began to admit women engineering students in 1952. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had graduated its first female student, Ellen Swallow Richards (1842‚Äì1911), in 1873. The √âcole Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, from 1984 to 1994, the number of women graduating with a BA or BS degree in computer science decreased by 23 percent. Terminology Although the terms engineer and engineering date from the Middle Ages, they acquired their current meaning and usage only recently in the nineteenth century. Briefly, an engineer is one who uses the principles of engineering ‚Äì namely acquiring and applying scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge ‚Äì in order to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. Some of the major branches of the engineering profession include civil engineering, military engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, computer engineering, and biomedical engineering. Inventors Before engineering was recognized as a formal profession, women with engineering skills often sought recognition as inventors. Tabitha Babbit (1784‚Äì1853?) was an American toolmaker who invented the first circular saw. Sarah Guppy (1770‚Äì1852) was an Englishwoman who patented a design for bridge foundations. Naval engineer Henrietta Vansittart (1833-1883) held patents across the world for the Lowe Vansittart propeller and was the first female to write, read, and illustrate her own diagrams and drawings for a scientific article presented at Association of Foreman Engineers and Draughtsmen. Mary Dixon Kies (1752‚Äì1837) was the first American woman to receive a patent for her method of weaving straw in 1809.Stanley, Autumn, Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Invention (Metuchen, NJ and London: Scarecrow Press, 1993). 19th century: entry into technical professions With the coming of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, new technology-based occupations opened up for both men and women. Sarah Bagley (1806‚Äì?) is remembered not only for her efforts to improved working conditions for women mill workers in Lowell, Massachusetts, in the 1830s and 1840s, but also for being one of the earliest women to work as a telegraph operator. Mathilde Fibiger (1830‚Äì1872), a Danish novelist and advocate of women's rights, became a telegraph operator for the Danish State Telegraph system in the 1860s. Engineering began to be taught as a formal academic discipline in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The √âcole Polytechnique in France was established in 1794 to teach military and civil engineering; West Point Military Academy in the United States established a program modeled after the √âcole Polytechnique in 1819. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) began to teach civil engineering in 1828. However, none of these institutions admitted women as students at the time of their founding. In the 19th century, women who performed engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. Ada Lovelace (1815‚Äì1852), Lord Byron's daughter, was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning the collaboration with Charles Babbage on his analytical engine that would earn her the designation of the \\"first computer programmer\\". Hertha Marks Ayrton (1854‚Äì1923), a British engineer and inventor who helped develop electric arc lighting, studied mathematics at Cambridge in 1880, but was denied a degree, as women were only granted certificates of completion at the time. Therefore moving to the University of London, which granted her a bachelor of Science degree in 1881. Similarly, Mary Engle Pennington (1872‚Äì1952), an American chemist and refrigeration engineer, completed the requirements for a BS degree in chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1892, but was given a certificate of proficiency instead. Elizabeth Bragg and Julia Morgan became the first women to receive a bachelor's degree in engineering, by the University of California, Berkeley - U.S.A, in civil engineering (1876) and mechanical engineering (1894). In the same year of Morgan's accomplish, Bertha Lamme was also graduated from Ohio State University in mechanical engineering. Rita de Morais Sarmento (1872‚Äì1931) was the first woman to obtain an Engineering degree in Europe. She enrolled at the Academia Polit√©cnica do PortoAcademia Polit√©cnica do Porto to study civil engineering of public works, which she concluded with various distinctions in 1894. Two years later, she was granted with the \\"Civil Engineering certificate of capability\\" to practise as a professional engineer, and although she never did, she was the first formally and fully recognised European female engineer. Lydia Weld was the first woman to graduate in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, starting her studies in 1898 and going on to work as a draughtsman in the engineering division of Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. She later became the second woman member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Other women in engineering in the same time period include three Danish women: Agnes Klingberg, Betzy Meyer, and Julie Arenholt, who graduated from 1897 to 1901, at the Polyteknisk L√¶reanstalt, today known as the Danmarks Tekniske Universitet Women without formal engineering degrees were also integral to great 19th century civil engineering feats. Emily Warren Roebling is recognized as managing the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, and was the first person to cross the bridge at its opening ceremony in 1883.http://www.asce.org/templates/person- bio-detail.aspx?id=11203 Roebling's husband, Washington Roebling, worked as the chief engineer for the Brooklyn Bridge project until he fell ill of decompression sickness. Upon her husband's illness, Emily Warren Roebling assumed her husband's duties at the project site, and taught herself about material properties, cable construction, calculating catenary curves and other subjects. 20th century: entry into engineering programs In the early years of the twentieth century, a few women were admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as curiosities by their male counterparts. On 27 July 1904, Maria Elisabeth Bes graduated in chemical engineering from the Polytechische School te Delft, becoming the first female graduate engineer in the Netherlands. Nora Stanton Blatch Barney (1883‚Äì1971), daughter of Harriot Stanton Blatch and granddaughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was the first woman to receive a degree in civil engineering from Cornell University in 1905. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the American Society of Civil Engineers; however, twelve years later, after having worked as an engineer, architect, and engineering inspector, her request for an upgrade to associate membership was denied. Olive Dennis (1885‚Äì1957), who became the second woman to graduate from Cornell with a civil engineering degree in 1920, was initially hired by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as a draftsman; however, she later became the first person to claim the title of Service Engineer when this title was created. Cleone Benest passed the City and Guilds of London Institute's motor-engineering examination, the Royal Automobile Club's mechanical test in 1908 and took the Portsmouth Municipal College examination for heat engines in 1910. Using the professional name of C. Griff, she joined several engineering organizations and established a consultancy business in Mayfair. Alice Perry was one of the first formally recognised female engineers in Europe, graduated with a degree in engineering in 1908 from Queen's College, Galway. In 1908, Emma Strada was the first woman engineering graduate in Italy, coming third out of 62 in her class. Elisa Leonida Zamfirescu (1887‚Äì1973), due to prejudices against women in the sciences, was rejected by the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest, Romania. However, in 1909, she was accepted at the Royal Academy of Technology in Berlin. She graduated from the university in 1912, with a degree in engineering, specialising in chemistry, possibly becoming one of the first women engineers in the world. Edith Clarke, the inventor of the graphical calculator, was the first woman to earn a degree in MIT's electrical engineering department in 1918. Clarke also became the first woman admitted to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the precursor to the IEEE. She taught at the University of Texas Austin, where she was the only woman faculty member in the engineering department. In 1919, in the United Kingdom, the first engineering society for women was founded - the Women's Engineering Society or WES as it is commonly known - and it is still active today, continuing to support women in engineering. Founders included Lady Katharine Parsons, who was instrumental in the engineering work of her husband Sir Charles Parsons, their daughter and first President of WES Rachel Parsons, house builder and suffragette, Laura Annie Willson, Eleanor Shelley-Rolls, Margaret Rowbotham, Margaret, Lady Moir, with Caroline Haslett the founding Secretary. Juana Pereyra graduated from the Faculty of Engineering of the Universidad de la Rep√∫blica in Uruguay, with the title of Ingeniera de Puentes y Caminos (Engineer of Bridges and Roads) in November 1920, making her one of the first female engineers in South America. In 1921, S√©bastienne Guyot (1894-1941) graduated in mechanics and engineering from the Central School of Paris in the first year group to allow women as students. She became an aeronautical engineer, ending her career as Head of the Helicopter Service at the French Arsenal de l'A√©ronautique. In 1922, Marguerite Massart graduated from the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles with a degree in civil engineering, making her the first woman to qualify as an engineer in Belgium. She later set up a successful foundry business in Ghent and introduced a desalinisation project and early solar panels in the first hotel on Sal Island in Cape Verde. The first woman to earn a civil engineering degree in Mexico was Concepci√≥n Mendiz√°bal Mendoza in 1930. Ying Hsi Yuan trained as a Civil Engineer in Peiping in the 1930s and worked in bridge design in China before taking a postgraduate engineering degree in University of Liverpool in the 1940s, later working in Hong Kong. World War II engineering programs for women The entry of the United States into World War II created a serious shortage of engineering talent as men were drafted into the armed forces at the same time that industry ramped up production of armaments, battleships, and airplanes. The U.S. Office of Education initiated a series of courses in science and engineering that were open to women as well as men. Private programs for women included GE on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics, and the Curtiss-Wright Engineering Program had Curtiss-Wright Cadettes (e.g., Rosella Fenton). The company partnered with Cornell, Penn State, Purdue, the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, RPI, and Iowa State University to create an engineering curriculum that eventually enrolled over 600 women. The course lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production. Thelma Estrin (1924‚Äì2014), who would later become a pioneer in the fields of computer science and biomedical engineering, took a 1942 three-month engineering assistant course at Stevens Institute of Technology and earned University of Wisconsin BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees. Through an accelerated program brought on by the war, Lois Graham (1925-2013) graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1946 and was the first woman in the United States to receive a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology (M.S. ME ‚Äô49, Ph.D. ‚Äô59). Postwar era In 1943, the United States Army authorized a secret project at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering to develop an electronic computer to compute artillery firing tables for the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. The project, which came to be known as ENIAC, or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was completed in 1946. Previous to the development of the ENIAC, the U.S. Army had employed women trained in mathematics to calculate artillery trajectories, at first using mechanical desk calculators and later the differential analyzer developed by Vannevar Bush, at the Moore School. In 1945, one of these \\"computers\\", Kathleen McNulty (1921‚Äì2006), was selected to be one of the original programmers of the ENIAC, together with Frances Spence (1922‚Äì ), Betty Holberton (1917‚Äì2001), Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman (1924‚Äì1986), and Betty Jean Jennings (1924‚Äì2011). McNulty, Holberton, and Jennings would later work on the UNIVAC, the first commercial computer developed by the Remington Rand Corporation in the early 1950s. In 1946, Hattie Scott Peterson gained a degree in civil engineering, believed to be the first African-American woman to do so. In 1952, Polish electrical engineer Maria Wanda Jastrzƒôbska earned a master's degree in electronics and went on to set up early computer labs and influence university teaching. In 1957, Araceli S√°nchez Urquijo became the first female civil engineer to work in Spain, having been amongst the first 45 hydropower engineers trained at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute. Premala Sivaprakasapillai Sivasegaram studied Engineering at Somerville College, Oxford in the 1960s and became the first female engineer of Sri Lanka. Resistance to coeducation in engineering schools, 1950s‚Äì1970s The Cold War and the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union created additional demands for trained engineering talent in the 1950s and 1960s. Many engineering schools in the U.S. that had previously admitted only male students began to tentatively adopt coeducation. After 116 years as an all-male institution, RPI began to admit small numbers of female students in the 1940s. Georgia Tech began to admit women engineering students in 1952, but only in programs not available in other state universities. It would be 1968 before women were admitted to all courses offered by Georgia Tech. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had graduated its first female student, Ellen Swallow Richards (1842‚Äì1911) in 1873; she later became an instructor at MIT. However, until the 1960s, MIT enrolled few female engineering students, due in part to a lack of housing for women students. After the completion of the first women's dormitory on campus, McCormick Hall, in 1964, the number of women enrolled increased greatly. Influenced in part by the second wave feminism movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, female faculty members at MIT, including Mildred Dresselhaus and Sheila Widnall, began to actively promote the cause of women's engineering education.Bix, \\"'Engineeresses' Invade Campus,\\" 25-6. The √âcole Polytechnique in Paris first began to admit women students in 1972. Margaret Hamilton is also notable for her contributions to computer and aerospace engineering in the 1970s. Hamilton, the director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory at the time, is famous for her work in writing the on-board guidance code for the Apollo 11 mission.https://medium.com/@verne/margaret-hamilton-the-engineer-who-took-the- apollo-to-the-moon-7d550c73d3fa#.i1blqgw5r 1980s‚Äì1990s As more engineering programs were opened to women, the number of women enrolled in engineering programs increased dramatically. The number of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased by 45 percent between 1980 and 1994. However, during the period of 1984‚Äì1994, the number of women graduating with a BA/BS degree in computer science decreased by 23 percent (from 37 percent of graduates in 1984 to 28 percent in 1994). This phenomenon became known as \\"The incredible shrinking pipeline,\\" from the title of a 1997 paper on the subject by Tracy Camp, a professor in the Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the Colorado School of Mines.Camp, Tracy, \\"The Incredible Shrinking Pipeline\\", Communications of the ACM, Vol. 40 Nr. 10 (October 1997), 103‚Äì110. Some of the reasons for the decline cited in the paper included: * The development of computer games designed and marketed for males only; * A perception that computer science was the domain of \\"hacker/nerd/antisocial\\" personality types; * Gender discrimination in computing; * Lack of role models at the university level.Camp, T., and Gurer, D., \\"Women in Computer Science: Where Have We Been and Where are We Going?\\" Proceedings, Women and Technology: Historical, Societal, and Professional Perspectives. IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, New Brunswick, NJ, July 1999, 242‚Äì3. Statistics United States According to studies by the National Science Foundation, the percentage of BA/BS degrees in engineering awarded to women in the U.S. increased steadily from 0.4 percent in 1966 to a peak of 20.9 percent in 2002, and then dropped off slightly to 18.5 percent in 2008. However, the trend identified in \\"The incredible shrinking pipeline\\" has continued; the percentage of BA/BS degrees in mathematics and computer science awarded to women peaked in 1985 at 39.5 percent, and declined steadily to 25.3 percent in 2008. The percentage of master's degrees in engineering awarded to women increased steadily from 0.6 percent in 1966 to 22.9 percent in 2008. The percentage of doctoral degrees in engineering awarded to women during the same period increased from 0.3 percent to 21.5 percent. Australia Only 9.6% of engineers in Australia are women, and the rate of women in engineering degree courses has remained around 14% since the 1990s. United Kingdom The percentage of female and technology engineering graduates rose from 7 percent in 1984 to 14.6 percent in 2018. The proportion of engineers in industry who are women is, on the other hand, still very low at around 11.8% ‚Äì the lowest percentage in the EU.

He previously served as National Security Advisor beginning in June 2002. He has accompanied Afghan President Hamid Karzai on all official visits since the establishment of the Interim Administration in 2001. He resigned as Foreign Minister on 5 October 2013 to stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election. Career Rassoul was born in or about 1942 in Kabul, Afghanistan, to Abdu'l Qayyum Khan Sarkar and his wife Farukh Begum, daughter of Emir Habibullah Khan. AmƒÅnullƒÅh KhƒÅn, the King of Aghanistan 1909‚Äì1929, was his uncle. He attended Lyc√©e Esteqlal where he graduated as the valedictorian. Subsequently, he traveled to France to study on a scholarship at the Paris Medical School and received his M.D. in 1973. An ethnic Pashtun, belonging to Barakzai (Mohammadzai) tribe (of the Zirak branch of the Durrani Confederacy), he is fluent in Dari Persian, French, English, and Italian and has a working knowledge of Arabic and Pashto. He has over 30 publications in European and American medical journals and is a member of the American Society of Nephrology. Since 1998, Rassoul devoted his full attention to the convening of the Emergency Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly) as the director of the Secretariat of Mohammad Zaher Shah, the former King of Afghanistan. Under Rassoul's leadership, the Secretariat in Rome played a key role in the future political transition of Afghanistan. Prior to the Bonn Conference, Zahir Shah dispatched numerous delegations to world capitals, Afghanistan's neighbors, and Afghanistan itself to build support for the convening of the Emergency Loya Jirga. Rassoul accompanied President Hamid Karzai, at that time a leading member of the Executive Committee of the Loya Jirga, on these missions. Rassoul was suited for this work because of his long term, close contact with Afghan resistance and his 1980 founding and publishing of the monthly publication Afghan Reality created to increase awareness and be a voice of information from inside Afghanistan to the international community regarding the plight of the Afghan people. Rassoul was nominated by President Hamid Karzai as Minister of Civil Aviation and unanimously approved by the Cabinet in March 2002. Under his leadership, Afghanistan's aviation sector was revived after many years of United Nations sanctions against the Taliban and Afghanistan. Rassoul played an important role in Afghanistan's readmission to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Prior to his service in the Afghan government, Rassoul served as a delegate to the historic November 2001 Bonn Conference. Following the Bonn Conference, he accompanied President Karzai to Kabul for the inauguration of the Afghan Interim Administration. Dr. Rassoul is unmarried and has no children. 2014 presidential election On 5 October 2013 Rassoul resigned from his position as Foreign Minister and on 6 October he officially filed his nomination to stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election. His running mate is Ahmad Zia Massoud.

After attempting to retrieve money owed to him for a fraudulent gas license provided by Marat Balagula (who he sold bootlegged gasoline for in a western New York gas station, among many other enterprises) Reznikov was shot dead by the Lucchese crime family, to whom Balagula was paying street tax. Reznikov's murder remained unsolved until the 1994 cooperation of Lucchese acting boss Anthony Casso. According to Casso, the shooting was actually committed by Joseph Testa and Anthony Senter, two veterans of the DeMeo crew. Life  Early years   Gangster career  In the spring of 1986, the Colombo crime family crew, led by Michael Franzese, began shaking down associates of Balagula, who was running a multibillion-dollar gasoline bootlegging operation. In response, Balagula asked for a sit-down with Christopher Furnari, the consiglieri for the Lucchese crime family. After the sit-down took place in Brooklyn's 19th Hole social club, Balagula agreed to pay street tax to the Lucchese family. The money was not only strategically shared, but also became the Five Families' biggest moneymaker after narcotics trafficking. According to Philip Carlo, > It didn't take long for word on the street to reach the Russian underworld: > Marat Balagula was paying off the Italians; Balagula was a punk; Balagula > had no balls. Balagula's days were numbered. This, of course, was the > beginning of serious trouble. Balagula did in fact have balls‚Äîhe was a > ruthless killer when necessary‚Äîbut he also was a smart diplomatic > administrator and he knew that the combined, concerted force of the Italian > crime families would quickly wipe the newly arrived Russian competition off > the proverbial map. Shortly afterward, on June 12, 1986, Vladimir Reznikov entered Balagula's headquarters at the Rasputin nightclub. He pushed a 9mm Beretta into Balagula's skull and demanded the $600,000 that he alleged Balagula owed him. After Balagula promised to get the money, Reznikov allegedly snarled \\"Fuck with me and you're dead‚Äîyou and your whole fucking family; I swear‚Äîyou understand?\\" (although all conversation took place in Russian, so proper translation is suspect)Gaspipe, p. 153.). Shortly after Reznikov left, Balagula suffered a massive heart attack. He insisted, however on being treated at his home in Brighton Beach, where he felt it would be harder for Reznikov to gain access to him. When Lucchese underboss Anthony Casso arrived, he listened to what had happened and said, \\"Send word to Vladimir that you have his money, that he should come to the club tomorrow. We'll take care of the rest.\\"Gaspipe, p. 154. Casso also requested a photograph of Reznikov and a description of his car.Gaspipe, p. 154. The following day, Reznikov arrived at Balagula's nightclub for the meet. Instead, Reznikov was attacked by Gambino associate Joseph Testa from behind, who fatally shot him on Casso's orders. According to Casso, \\"After that, Marat didn't have any problems with other Russians.\\"Robert I. Friedman, Rad Mafiya; How the Russian Mob has Invaded America, 2008 p. 55.

Although the band was named after Jimi Hendrix and Curtis Mayfield references, the band's music does not bear a resemblance to either icon. Instead, Gypsy Fly's music has been described as ‚Äúan undeniably catchy mix of metal and pop punk.‚Äù Band members Current Members and Aliases * Tom Hultsch (Tommy2K) ‚Äì lead vocals and guitar * Jay Diebert (Jimmy James) ‚Äì bass * Dave Hultsch (Ash) ‚Äì drums Former members * Troy Thompson ‚Äì lead vocals (1998‚Äì2003) * Zach Pospisil ‚Äì bass (1998‚Äì2003) History Early years: Self Titled Album (1998-2000) Gypsy Fly formed in 1998 at Glenbard North High School in Carol Stream (the same alma mater as The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan). The original line-up consisted of Troy Thompson (lead vocals), Tom Hultsch (guitar), Zach Pospisil (bass), and Dave Hultsch (drums). After self-releasing their first album, Gypsy Fly quickly gained attention on a local and national level. They interviewed with Chicago's WZRD (88.3 FM) radio, played local shows at Afternight Soundstage in Melrose Park, Illinois where they were televised on local television stations, and performed on The Jenny Jones Show. The band's single ‚ÄúStripper Girlfriend‚Äù received radio attention, and even some play in local retail stores. Bittersweetness: Pink Lavender (2000-2003) After the success of the first album, Gypsy Fly channeled more of their indy influences, such as Ben Lee with Rancid, Black Flag, Idlewild, Pavement, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, to create their second album. This album had more of an edgy energy and a sound that was different compared to the harder sounds of Limp Bizkit and other popular bands during that time. This unique sound propelled Gypsy Fly even further. They were chosen as band of the week in a 94.7 ‚ÄúThe Zone‚Äù (WZZN-FM) contest and won a bill at the House of Blues. Thereafter, they performed at the Metro in Chicago, and participated in the Vans Warped Tour by performing at First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in Tinley Park, Illinois and Marcus Amphitheater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in addition to playing at Tower Records stores after their initial album release. In 2003, soon after Gypsy Fly's first set of shows to support their album, Zach departed the band. The band played with fill-in bass players until they finally found bassist Jay Diebert, but then, during the same year, lead vocalist Troy left the band. Transformation: Labeled (2005-2007) With Tom on lead vocals, Gypsy Fly released an EP and received an honorable mention for their original song ‚ÄúYoung Again‚Äù from the Annual Billboard World Songwriting Contest. It placed in the top 1,500 entries. Also, radio DJ James Van Osdol gave extensive radio play to ‚ÄúDisappear,‚Äù which was played almost weekly on 94.7 ‚ÄúThe Zone‚Äù (WZZN- FM). Yet, ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù was praised as ‚Äúthe strongest track‚Äù because ‚Äúit is driven by strong bass line and more creative vocals.‚Äù New beginning: Breathing Air (2007-2009) Breathing Air, the first full-length album by the restructured band, was guitar driven, but more poppy than the previous records. Incidentally, Lou Hinkhouse, who had also worked with The Smashing Pumpkins, shot a video for Gypsy Fly's single ‚ÄúI Wanna Get Off,‚Äù which debuted on Chicago music television show JBTV. The song ‚ÄúAll You Needed‚Äù played on ‚ÄúQ101‚Äù (101.1 WKQX), and the trio were regular guests on Fearlessradio.com's New Music Binge. During this time, they also had a weekly half-hour podcast on iTunes called Gypsy Fly Music Net. New attitude: Silver or Lead (2009-Present) Finally capturing the band's energy of playing live, Silver or Lead has a more serious, yet irreverent tone. In his review of the album, Dean Ramos of Illinois Entertainer said, ‚ÄúGypsy Fly can without a doubt ‚Äòrawk!‚Äô with the best of them.‚Äù Such a statement describes the band‚Äôs coming of age. With Silver or Lead, the band received the most airplay and radio station interviews, and Gypsy Fly‚Äôs music was played on unconventional formats such as the Waddle & Silvy show on ESPN 1000 (WMVP-AM). The band was also featured on the ‚ÄúQ101‚Äù website for an up-and-coming band contest sponsored by Old Style Beer. Director Lou Hinkhouse returned to shoot a video for ‚ÄúPlay with Fire,‚Äù using the same camera used to film The Book of Eli. Gypsy Fly continued to promote the album at various venues throughout the city of Chicago and surrounding suburbs.

With his father as a DJ, he grew up surrounded by the sounds of jazz, blues, and R&B; from Earth, Wind & Fire to Al Green and more. After trying numerous instruments, at the age of nine he settled on the violin. In his Atlanta school years, he trained classically on the violin, with training from members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and he became a founding member of the DeKalb Youth Pops Orchestra. Ford also joined the African American Philharmonic Orchestra (AAPO), working his way up to Concert Master. While playing with the AAPO, he performed for Barry White. Growing up hearing different genres, Ford followed his father's footsteps for a time as a DJ and counts Stevie Wonder and violinists Noel Pointer and Jean-Luc Ponty among his musical influences. At his mother's urging to pursue education with a backup career plan, he completed a degree in Computer Information Systems. He became a fixture on Atlanta's music scene and his renown grew.

History The first race was launched by Nikki Caplan and John O'Toole in December 1973 at a gathering of six balloons and twenty spectators.Library of Congress: Balloon Race. In 1977, organization of the race passed from Caplan and O'Toole to a group of four novice balloonists who continue to coordinate the event today. These men are John Marlow, John Schaumburg, Ted Staley, and Dan Schettler, who formed a ballooning group known as the Mississippi River Balloon Transit Company. This company now is the host of the largest and most well attended balloon race. On May 23, 2000, the race was honored by the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress as a local legacy after a nomination by then-Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives Dick Gephardt. So now, the Great Forest Park Balloon Race is forever documented through photographs, advertisements, media, and pilot rewards. No race was held in 2020.

In addition to the Balloon Glow and a fireworks show, during the week of the event, a free public orchestral concert by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra is held on nearby Art Hill, adjacent to the Saint Louis Art Museum. During the race, the balloonists attempt to \\"chase\\" a 166-foot balloon of a pink bunny after taking off from the Central Fields in Forest Park. The goal is to follow the bunny until it lands, and then each pilot drops a sandbag or birdseed bag as close as possible to the bunny balloon. The winner is decided based on which pilots's sandbag, or birdseed bag, is the closest to the bunny. Due to its urban location in the city of St. Louis, the race is considered \\"particularly prestigious and challenging\\", and participation is by invitation only. At times, landing sites have included backyards, baseball diamonds, golf courses, street intersections, and the convent grounds of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The balloon race is accompanied by a festival that includes food and drink, inflatable castles, and a climbing wall.

Summary The plot revolves around a robotic revolt led by a robot named De Gaulle in the year 2199 AD. By the explosions of global nuclear war, society has broken up into nine small expulsions, one of them disappeared and Venus collided with another celestial object. Humanity only slightly survived. Its thread of life barely connected to a body; which was rebuilt into a cyborg. The heroine is named Al Tiana and is also apparently a robot who does not support the rebellion. She is out to prove her loyalty to the humans. There are only two songs on the entire soundtrack. Once a stage is cleared, it can never be retried. The game system allows a variety of items to be used. However, actually using it can be difficult. On the video game cover art, the heroine is depicted joining the fight in a leotard.

Early life and education Abrams was one of two children born to Efrat Abrams and Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment lawyer. Her brother, Dan Abrams, is a television personality and internet entrepreneur who currently serves as legal analyst for Good Morning America. She was raised in New York City's Upper East Side, where she attended the Dalton School. Abrams received a Bachelor of Arts from Cornell University in 1990. In 1993, she received a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School. After completing law school, she served as a law clerk for Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Professional career From 1998 to 2008, Abrams worked as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where she served as Chief of the General Crimes Unit from 2005 to 2007 and Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division from 2007 to 2008. She received the United States Department of Justice Director's Award for Superior Performance for two cases. The first case involved the convictions of members of a Colombian gang wanted for the murder of a New York City police detective and some 100 armed robberies; the second case was for the convictions of leaders of the Bloods gang. In 2008, Abrams returned to Davis Polk as Special Counsel for Pro Bono. She had previously worked at the firm as a litigation associate from 1994 to 1998. While at Davis Polk, Ms. Abrams served as Counsel to the New York State Justice Task Force, a task force created by New York State Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman to examine the causes of wrongful convictions and make recommendations for changes to safeguard against such convictions in the future.http://www.nyjusticetaskforce.com/2009.07.15.NYLJ.Article.pdf Abrams is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School, where she teaches about investigating and prosecuting federal criminal cases. Federal judicial service Senator Kirsten Gillibrand recommended Abrams to fill a judicial vacancy on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On July 28, 2011, President Barack Obama formally nominated Abrams to the Southern District of New York. She replaced Judge Lewis A. Kaplan who took senior status in 2011. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on her nomination on October 4, 2011, and reported her nomination to the floor on November 3, 2011. On March 22, 2012, the Senate confirmed Abrams in a 96‚Äì2 vote. She received her commission on March 23, 2012. In 2015, Judge Abrams, together with another judge, created and began to run the \\"Young Adult Opportunity Program,\\" a judicially supervised pretrial program for non-violent young adults charged in the Southern District of New York. The Program provides young adult defendants with access to employment, counseling, and treatment resources. Program participants, if they are successful, may receive a shorter sentence, or even a reduction, deferral or dismissal of the charges against them. Notable cases In October 2013, Carmen Segarra filed suit against the Federal Reserve in an action Judge Abrams presided over, alleging that she was terminated due to reporting to her superiors that the Goldman Sachs Group did not have a firmwide conflict-of-interest policy. Segarra alleged that her termination violated the whistleblower protection provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, . On April 23, 2014, Judge Abrams dismissed the suit. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal, calling some of Segarra's arguments, \\"entirely speculative, meritless and frankly quite silly.\\" In 2016, Abrams was assigned to preside over a case in which Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein are accused by the plaintiff of having raped her in the 1990s, when the plaintiff was thirteen years old. The complaint was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the Plaintiff in September 2016. In January 2017, Abrams was assigned to preside over a pending case in which Donald Trump was sued by a nonprofit group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, over an alleged violation by Trump of the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the United States Constitution. On July 11, 2017, Judge Abrams recused herself from the case when her husband, Greg Andres, began talks to join Special Counsel Robert Mueller's staff investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In April 2018, Judge Abrams presided over the trial of an ex-U.S. Army Sergeant and two other men who were convicted of participating in a murder for hire of a woman in the Philippines. The primary cooperating witness was Paul Le Roux, a notorious crime lord who testified about the covert world of mercenary work as well as selling missile technology to Iran and smuggling weapons to rebels and warlords. In July 2018, Judge Abrams presided over the trial in an action brought by Enrichetta Ravina, a former finance professor at Columbia University's Business School against Columbia and a more senior tenured professor, Geert Bekaert, for sex discrimination and retaliation. The jury found that Ravina had not been sexually harassed but that she had been retaliated against by Bekaert, who wrote at least 30 emails calling Ravina \\"evil\\" and \\"crazy,\\" including to a number of industry players at the Federal Reserve Bank, top-tier universities and economic journals. In November 2018, She tried to acquit Hunter Biden's criminal associate Devon Archer of charges but they were later duly reinstated by a Federal Appeals court. Archer was first convicted in June 2018 of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud, but five months later, trial Judge Ronnie Abrams of the Southern District of New York overturned the conviction. In its ruling, the Second Circuit of Appeals wrote that the District Court \\"abused its discretion\\" in overturning the jury's verdict. Personal life Abrams and her husband, Greg Donald Andres, formerly a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell. were married in 2001 by Judge Loretta A. Preska. , Andres served with Robert Mueller on the Special Counsel investigation. url=https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer-exclusive- idUSKBN1AH5F9/ .

Biography Luis de Aliaga Mart√≠nez was born in Mosqueruela in 1560, the son of a nobleman who nevertheless ran a cloth business. After he was orphaned, he entered the Dominican monastery in Zaragoza in 1582. He was invited to teach theology at the University of Zaragoza, but instead, in 1605, he moved to the Dominican monastery in San Ildefonso. In 1606, Father Javierre, who had been his prior at Zaragoza convinced him to come to Madrid as his assistant. On 6 December 1608 he was named confessor of Francisco G√≥mez de Sandoval, 1st Duke of Lerma, favourite of Philip III of Spain. Lerma soon had Aliaga appointed confessor to the king (a position that had previously been held by Diego Mardones, a member of the Franciscan Order, who became Bishop of C√≥rdoba). In this influential position, Aliaga was a leading voice calling for the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609. The king offered to make him Archbishop of Toledo, but he refused. Aliaga accepted the king's offer to name him Archimandrite of Sicily and a member of the Spanish Council of State. Although he was close to Lerma, in 1618, he played a role in Lerma's downfall. The new favourite, Crist√≥bal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda had Aliaga named Grand Inquisitor of Spain in 1619. When Philip III died in 1624, the new king, Philip IV of Spain removed Aliaga from office and ordered him exiled to Huete and later to Aragon. He died in Zaragoza in 1626.

Lenkov and produced by Cookie Jar Entertainment Inc., Sunwoo Entertainment Co. Ltd., Sunwoo Asia-Pacific Pte. Ltd., and Optix Entertainment GmbH. It premiered on CITV in the United Kingdom on 2 October 2010. In the past, it also aired on Starz Kids & Family in the United States and YTV and Vrak (French Canadian Dub) in Canada . Main characters Kung Fu Dino Posse *Kane: (voiced by Matthew Gorman) A Green Tyrannosaurus rex, and the leader of the Posse. He is the most headstrong (perhaps too headstrong) and confident of the Posse, and his just heart won't let Skor get away with his evil plans. Sometimes, he can get a little too serious with the task at hand, and his pride can get the better of him in some situations, but he is a natural leader and will be first to the rescue when his friends are in trouble. Apparently, he prefers quieter hobbies, (previously didn't like loud music) and is still less familiar with the modern world. *Lucy: (voiced by Laura Kolisnyk) A Yellow Triceratops, and the only girl in the Posse. She is quite resilient, calm, collected, and can follow and enforce orders from Kane without hesitation, but can be quite sarcastic. She is quite worldly and knowledgeable of the time of the dinosaurs and the modern era. She is seemingly quite into \\"girl stuff\\" in the modern era, such as having \\"girl talks\\", and her mannerisms and personality also reflect this, she sometimes gets annoyed with Jet and Chow's immature remarks or actions. *Jet: (voiced by Brent Hirose) An Orange Pteranodon. Comes off as the most street smart and (modern) worldly of the Posse, especially in terms of language (referring to many people as \\"Dudes\\"). He comes off as rude, somewhat of a jerk, and full of himself but can be helpful, and quick to cover up a situation with words to those who are unaware. At times, he can be quite hasty which gets him captured or into trouble, usually as a result of trying to command the Posse, and take charge from Kane. *Chow: (voiced by Nolan Balzer) A Red Stegosaurus who has a voracious appetite. The largest and physically strongest dino in the Posse, and not exactly the smartest dino out there and can come off as somewhat clumsy and na√Øve, and more often than not, his appetite gets the best of him, but he is a very friendly and kind, dinosaur, just don't hide food from him. He seems quite quick to adapt and mimic the personalities and mannerisms of different people and new situations. Friends of the Posse *Edgar Chudley: (voiced by Simon Miron) He aids the Posse with his knowledge in mathematics, science and technology. Sometimes his knowledge and overthinking is too much for the Posse. He lives in the museum with the posse. *Polly: (voiced by Amy Tang) Another friend of the posse, who studies in the field of paleontology. Edgar has a crush on her. Secondary characters *Agatha Dimplecorn: (voiced by Gloria Nikkel) She is an elderly lady who is often heckling (unintentionally) with the Kung Fu Dino Posse. *Professor Sherman Daniels: Polly's grandfather and curator of the museum. Antagonists *Skor: (voiced by Carey Smith) The main antagonist of the series, and older brother of Skrap, he usually orders Skrap and his other minions to do his dirty work, such as stealing crystals from the Posse, while he stays in his lair. Although both Skor and Skrap are both referred to \\"raptors\\" in the first episode, they both have neck frills akin to the Dilophosaurus depicted in the 1993 film Jurassic Park. *Skrap: (voiced by Kevin Michele) Skor's younger, less intelligent brother, who reluctantly takes orders from his brother to do his dirty work. His regular incompetence with tasks disappoints and annoys Skor.

Indira Dummugudem lift irrigation scheme starting at is planned to supply irrigation water for 200,000 acres in Khammam, Krishna and West Godavari districts drawing Godavari River water from the back waters of Polavaram reservoir. Dummugudem weir on Godavari Nagarjuna Left Canal deep cut Existing weir Dummugudem weir across the Godavari River was constructed nearly 150 years back by the famous British India engineer Sir Arthur Cotton who also constructed Dowleswaram and Prakasam barrages.http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/protest-against- demolition-of-anicut/article4057783.ece The purpose of this weir was not for diverting the river water into canals but to use as cross over bridge during lean flow season. This weir has lost its relevance after construction of all weather road bridge near Bhadrachalam town to cross the river. A 24 MW hydroelectric station is constructed to use the level drop available across the Dummugudem weir. Jyothi Rao Pule Dummugudem Nagarjunasagar Sujala Sravanthi Project This project is also called Dummugudem to Sagar tail pond lift canal project. The canal starts from Dummugudem pond at to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond located across the Krishna River. This lift canal is an inter river basin transfer link by feeding Godavari river water from the Dummugudem pond to Krishna river basin to the extent of 165 tmcft. The total length of the canal is 244 km and the capacity of the canal is 22,000 cusecs to feed 165 tmcft water in three months duration of the monsoon season. Presently, the canal is planned to terminate at by feeding the water into the Halia river to reach the downstream Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond. The required pumping head is 128 meters for the elevation difference of 30 meters between Dummugudem pond (45 MSL) and Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond (75 MSL). Dummugudem pond to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond link canal is entirely located in Telangana State and needs to be routed through high lands which necessitated more pumping head. If this canal were to be terminated in to deep cut portion of Nagarjuna Sagar left canal near , water can reach by gravity to the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir when its water level is at minimum draw down level of MSL. It is more economical and purposeful to install a pump house drawing water from the deep cut portion of the canal to pump water up to Nagarjuna Sagar full reservoir level at MSL with nearly 27 meters lift. Thus it is a viable project by eliminating the need of lifting water by 80 meters from tail pond to the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir. This saved pumping head can be used to pump water from the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir to Srisailam reservoir for supplying irrigation water to Kalwakurthi lift irrigation Scheme, Srisailam left bank canal, Dindi lift irrigation scheme, Palamuru lift canal, Nettampadu lift, Bhima lift, etc located in Telangana with 100% water dependability for all the projects drawing water from the Krishna river.  Alternate to Dummugudem to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond link canal An alternative link canal to Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond from Polavaram dam is also economically feasible to transfer Godavari water.

Synopsis The filmmaker finds himself in frequent conflict with his son, who is no longer the delightful child the father loved, but an argumentative young adult who inhabits virtual worlds available through the internet. To the father, the son seems to be addicted to and permanently distracted by those worlds. The filmmaker undertakes a journey to St. Quay-Portrieux in Brittany where he worked for a spring as a wedding photographer's assistant at age 24 ‚Äìslightly older than his son is now. He has not been back to St. Quay since that visit, and hopes to gain some perspective on what his own life was like when he was his son's age. He also hopes to track down his former employer, a fascinating Frenchman named Maurice, and Maud, a woman with whom he was romantically involved during that spring 38 years ago.

In 1999, he lost all five fingers on his left hand while attempting to protect his teammates from a hand grenade detonating prematurely during classified Special Forces training. After recuperating in Hawaii, Ray attended Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, earning a Master of Public Administration in Strategic Management (MPA) with Distinction as a Littauer Fellow. He then earned an MBA from Harvard Business School and was recognized with the Dean's Award for exceptional leadership and service. Upon graduation, he was selected as a White House Fellow and worked as a Special Assistant to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. Jefferson then served as a Fulbright Fellow in Singapore, where he studied leadership within Asian contexts (2001‚Äì2002). From 2003‚Äì2004, he served as Deputy Director, State of Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism (DBEDT), Honolulu. DBEDT's mission involves creating jobs, facilitating business development, diversifying the economy and creating renewable energy initiatives.

While serving in this position, Jefferson implemented methods to accelerate the agency, which allowed it to achieve its goals quicker. This involved raising awareness of the employment situation for veterans in the armed forces in rural areas of America. This was planned to overhaul the Transition Assistance Program that was in place at the time. One of those initiatives was applying talent development best practices to achieve results in securing meaningful employment for veterans. The work he carried out was acknowledged in Fortune & Forbes Magazines, along with Bloomberg Businessweek. Jefferson was praised for his leadership at VETS by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. ‚ÄúHe has worked tirelessly for the last 18, 19 months,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know that we have much more to accomplish, but under his leadership I know we can bring so many more people together to understand the importance and sacrifices of our veterans, their families and their communities.\\" On May 6, 2010, Ray Jefferson launched a \\"100-Day Sprint\\" that included deadlines for specific goals to be met within the agency. The sprint focused on achieving dramatic improvement in four primary areas: improving new programs, launching new initiatives, improving management practices in the agency, and developing talent in the agency. The VETS team, led by Jefferson, set forth 22 goals in 4 areas and reached all goals within the 100-Day Sprint deadline of August 13, 2010.

Jefferson resigned from his position as Assistant Secretary at the Department of Labor on July 25, 2011, following accusations that he violated federal procurement rules. Peter Choharis, the lawyer representing Jefferson after the allegations said the findings relied on hearsay and had many internal inconsistencies and contradictions. An Inspector General's report alleged there were complaints by employees and government contractors that Jefferson violated procurement policies associated with directing VETS employees into awarding contracts to management consultant Stewart Liff. According to The Washington Post, Jefferson denied giving any special treatment for Liff, telling investigators that he believed Liff could help transform the culture at VETS. In a separate response, Liff asserted he received no special treatment and conformed to all government contracting requirements and work performance.

History Railroads in Northwest Arkansas The North Arkansas and Western Railroad was chartered on November 29, 1899, to connect Fayetteville with nearby Indian Territory. Track was completed to Tahlequah, Oklahoma, under the name Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway, which was based in Fayetteville. This track also connected Fayetteville to Westville, Oklahoma, which gave access to the Kansas City Southern Railway. Now with access to the Kansas City Southern in Westville and the Frisco in Fayetteville, bushels of apples and other fruits grown in the Illinois River Valley south of Fayetteville were able to be shipped elsewhere. The first train arrived in Fayetteville on August 22, 1901. The tracks were extended west to Fort Gibson and Muskogee, Oklahoma, by 1903 after bridging the Arkansas River. The Ozark and Cherokee Central was leased and later bought by the Frisco. The Frisco also maintained a junction where the St. Paul, Arkansas, rail connected to the main line. This junction was named Fayette Junction and is now within the Fayetteville city limits. Location The depot built in 1925 was preceded by two other depots on the same plot. As its predecessors did, the Frisco Depot has served as a place for locals, travelers, and University of Arkansas students to mingle.

It is a mixed-media installation, consisting of a derelict ship on the lake and a guardhouse and its equipment on the shore. It was commissioned in 2010 by the Indianapolis Museum of Art for its sculpture garden, known as the 100 Acres Park. Description Eden II consists of a ship made of steel, dock floats, concrete, paint, anchors, steel cable and various other mixed media, plus a guard house constructed with plywood and galvanized steel, containing LCD monitors, security cameras, a media player and an audio amplifier. The work combines real and fictional elements: the speakers play both local weather forecasts and dispatches from imaginary guards (whose voices were provided by IMA security staff), while the monitors display footage from the security camera trained on the viewer as well as simulated imagery from within the ship. It is intended as a commentary on global warming, with the refugees on board the ship driven out by \\"rising sea levels and the ecological impact of climate change\\". Construction Although the original plan was to use a pre- existing vessel, in the end M√§kip√§√§ opted to \\"construct a floating structure that resembles a ship\\" with the assistance of the local engineering company Silver Creek Engineering, Inc. A steel frame gives the ship the necessary strength to withstand waves, wind, snow and ice. A system of pontoons and weights keep it afloat and upright, and it is moored in place with weighted anchor lines. It was constructed both onsite and at the Herron School of Art & Design by M√§kip√§√§, the Icelandic artist Halld√∫r √ölfarsson, Herron students, structural engineers from Silver Creek, and the IMA Design and Installation Crew. The museum's director at the time, Maxwell Anderson, has theorized that, in spite of the effort that went into constructing it, the ship will be slowly demolished by its aquatic environment, and he sees no reason to stop it: \\"We can imagine leaving Tea‚Äôs piece to become a shipwreck.

It is found at shallow depths in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It was placed in the subgenus Panningothuria by Rowe in 1969 and is the typetaxon of the subgenus. Sea cucumbers are marine invertebrates and are closely related to the sea urchins and starfish. All these groups tend to be radially symmetric and have a water vascular system that operates by hydrostatic pressure, enabling them to move around by use of many suckers known as tube feet. Sea cucumbers are usually leathery, gherkin-shaped animals with a cluster of short tentacles at one end. Description This sea cucumber has a cylindrical body and can grow to thirty centimetres long. It is usually deep brown or black but sometimes has an underlying yellowish mottling, especially on the underside. The skin is soft yet coarse and tough and is covered with fleshy papillae which are often tipped with white. The papillae are believed to be sensory organs sensitive to touch and possibly to chemicals dissolved in the water. The underside has three rows of tube feet for walking and climbing while the upper side has two rows of rudimentary suckers. The anterior end has a bunch of twenty yellowish short, retractable tentacles encircling the mouth. At the posterior, inside the body cavity, there are a bundle of Cuvierian tubules or cotton glands which can be ejected as a tangle of sticky white threads to confuse or enmesh predators.Barrett, J. & C. M. Yonge (1958) Collins Pocket Guide to the Sea Shore. Collins, London Distribution The black sea cucumber occurs around the Atlantic coasts of northwest Europe, the Canary Islands, the Azores and in the Mediterranean Sea. It is found on boulders and rocks, particularly vertical surfaces, from the intertidal zone down to a depth of about fifty metres. Biology The black sea cucumber is a detritivore and feeds mostly at night. When feeding, it bends its body down towards the substrate, presses the ring of oral papillae against the surface and opens its mouth wide. It then extends and retracts its short tentacles repeatedly and \\"vacuums\\" up sediment, extracts the nutritious part and deposits the unmetabolised portion as a sausage-like string of droppings. When not feeding, the mouth is closed and the tentacles retracted and it is difficult to tell which is the head end of the animal.The Cotton-Spinner Adult black sea cucumbers are normally either male or female. The gonads take a long time to mature and gametes are released synchronously into the water column in early spring, probably as a result of a rise in water temperatures. The larvae become part of the zooplankton. After several moults they grow tentacles and settle out onto the sea floor. Juveniles are seldom seen so it is surmised that they live by day in crevices and under rocks for protection from predators whereas the adults take no particular care to remain hidden. Ecology The parasitic copepod Asterocheres boecki is an endoparasite of the black sea cucumber. It has been found that twenty-six saponins (triterpene glycosides) are present in the Cuvierian tubules and twelve in the animal's body wall. During stressful times, such as the presence of a predator, saponins are released into the surrounding water. It is thought that, though these are insufficient to harm a potential predator, they may serve as a warning that the cucumber is unpalatable.

The house was made famous by its depiction in Andrew Wyeth's Christina's World. The house and its occupants, Christina and Alvaro Olson, were depicted in numerous paintings and sketches by Wyeth from 1939 to 1968. The house was designated as a National Historic Landmark in June 2011. The Farnsworth Art Museum owns the house; it is open to the public. Early history The Hathorn-Olson House was built in the late 1700s by Captain Samuel Hathorn II (b abt. 1750). The house was substantially altered in 1871 by Captain Samuel Hathorn IV (1822‚Äì1892). The 1871 alterations included the addition of several bedrooms on the third floor and the construction of a steeply pitched roof. The property was inherited in 1929 by Christina Olson and Alvaro Olson from their mother Katie Hathorn (b. Feb. 15 1858 - d. Nov. 1929), a descendant of Captain Hathorn. Association with Wyeth Between 1939 and 1968, the house was depicted in paintings and sketches by the American artist Andrew Wyeth, including his 1948 masterpiece, Christina's World. Wyeth was inspired to paint Christina's World by the story of Christina Olson, who had lost the use of her legs to, at the time unknown, Charcot‚ÄîMarie‚ÄîTooth disease. Wyeth befriended the Olsons and maintained a studio in the house. Wyeth later recalled, \\"I just couldn't stay away from there. I did other pictures while I knew them but I'd always seem to gravitate back to the house.\\" Christina and Alvaro Olson lived at the house until they died in 1968 and 1967, respectively. Christina and Alvaro Olson and Andrew Wyeth are buried in the Olson family cemetery on the property. Later years After Christina's death, the house was purchased in 1968 by movie director Joseph E. Levine, who was an admirer of Wyeth's work. Levine operated the house as a museum for two years starting in 1971 but the operation met with opposition from local residents. In 1974, Levine announced that he would give the property to the State of Maine, but Levine withdrew the offer in 1975 over concerns that the state lacked funding to maintain the property. The house was purchased by Apple Inc. CEO John Sculley, who put the house up for sale in 1989. Sculley eventually donated the house to the Farnsworth Art Museum in 1991. The Olson House remains under the ownership of the Farnsworth Art Museum, which maintains it as a facility that is open for public visitation. Farnsworth executive director Christopher Brownawell noted, \\"This nondescript saltwater farmhouse and its connecting structure has become one of the most recognized images in American art.\\" Historic designation The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995 and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2011.

Biography  Hiroshi Senju was born in Tokyo. He has one brother, composer Akira Senju, and one sister, violinist Mariko Senjyu. He completed the MFA program in Fine Arts at Tokyo University of the Arts in 1984. He completed the doctoral course at Tokyo University of the Arts in 1987. His graduation work was purchased by The University of Tokyo. His success largely came about in the 1990s in response to his gigantic waterfall paintings. These paintings are often hung in corporate and public buildings, and Senju has been said to be one of a few artists today whose work is recognized by the general public. One of Senju‚Äôs waterfalls was the first painting by an Asian artist to be awarded an Honorable Mention at the Venice Biennale in 1995. These waterfall paintings often focus at the base of the waterfall where the falls crash into the pool below, usually cropping out the top of the falls. As a painter he primarily uses traditional Japanese painting techniques; employing pigments derived from natural materials and applying them to a specially designed mulberry paper base. In contrast to the norm of displaying such works in a dimly lit, tatami matted room, Hiroshi prefers his paintings to be viewed under natural light.  Works  Waterfall sliding doors at Sh≈çfus≈ç Art House Project in Naoshima Hiroshi Senju Museum Karuizawa  Venice Biennale in 1995  In 1995, at the 46th Venice Biennale celebrating its centennial year, Senju, who represented Japan, exhibited a huge waterfall mural in Japan Pavilion, measuring 3.4 meters high and 14 meters wide. Senju titled the work ‚ÄúTHE FALL‚Äù, which implied the fall of man, in Christian theology, God expelling Adam and Eve from the Garden. During the installation process, a welding contractor accidentally dropped scorching coal tar on his painting. Senju, watching the incident happened, immediately rushed for it and removed the coal tar by his bare hand. He had to go to emergency hospital with his left hand got burned. The only consolation was that Senju‚Äôs dominant hand was uninjured, being able to repair the damage by the opening of Biennale. Senju‚Äôs waterfall was the first painting by an Asian artist to be awarded the Honorable Mention, for having ‚Äúexpressed the meditative world of nature and the fluctuations of Japan‚Äôs traditional culture.‚Äù The Japan Hall commissioner was Junji Ito and the other exhibition artists were Yoichiro Kawaguchi, Zaigin Sai, and Katsuhiko Hibino. The site organizer was Kengo Kuma.  Haneda Airport  From 2004 to 2011, Senju created a series of large commissioned works for Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan. These works include: Water Shrine, a painting, 2.5 meters high by 17.9 meters wide, located at International Terminal in front of immigration Inspection. Ginga (Galaxy), a painting, 100 square meters, on the top ceiling of Terminal 2. Youru no Kohan (Evening Lakeside), a painting measuring 2.5 meters high and 12.5 meters wide, located at Terminal 2, 1F Terminal lobby. Moon, a sitting sculpture of bull, located at Terminal 2, 5F Market place. Asa no Kohan (Morning Lakeside), a painting, 2.5 meters high and 14 meters wide, located at Terminal 2, 1F Terminal lobby.  Shofuso  In 2007, Hiroshi Senju created a series of 20 fusuma (paper sliding door) paintings for the Shofuso Japanese House and Garden,Ozawa,Yuichi. Story of Shofuso. Friends of the Japanese House and Garden. Philadelphia, PA. 2010. in Philadelphia, PA. Asked to replace the destroyed fusuma paintings of Japanese National Treasure, artist Higashiyama Kaii, Senju said, \\"Shofuso offers a wonderful space for murals far exceeding my expectations, and I will do my best to paint murals symbolizing and important symbolic exchange between Japan and the United States.\\" Senju completed the installation in July 2006. He named the largest murals (8'x 12 1/2'), which serve as the centerpiece in the tokonoma alcove, Water Curtain, a play on the classic symbol of the Cold War, the Iron Curtain. This curtain, with its layers of falling water, was meant to symbolize the freedom of Philadelphia, the birthplace of the United States. The six murals in the first room are named Imagination of Dynamics and those of the second room are titled Imagination of Silence. The murals were first exhibited at Gwangju Biennale in South Korea in 2006 and were subsequently exhibited at the Yamatane Museum in Tokyo, Japan. More than fifty thousand visitors saw the murals prior to their installation at Shofuso. The murals were then shipped to their final destination in Philadelphia, arriving in March and installed in April 2007. In donating the new murals, Senju honored Sh≈çfus≈ç in the ancient Japanese tradition of master painters offering their talents to the community. Shofuso is the only place outside Japan to house a unique combination of contemporary art and traditional Japanese architecture. He also participated in the Art House Project in Naoshima, Kagawa  Venice Biennale in 2015  In 2015, Senju exhibited large-scale fluorescent pigment waterfalls Ryujin I and Ryujin II in a pitch-dark space, and natural pigment waterfall Suijin under daylight at Frontiers Reimagined, a collateral event of the Venice Biennale curated and organized by Sundaram Tagore Foundation.  Kongobuji  In 2015, it was officially confirmed that Senju would create a series of fusuma paintings for the head temple of Kongobuji of Koyasan, located on Mount K≈çya, Wakayama, Japan. In 2018, following its staging at the Toyama Prefectural Museum of Art & Design, Commemorating the Completion of Fusuma Paintings for Kongobuji Temple, Koyasan will tour multiple museums in Japan.È´òÈáéÂ±±ÈáëÂâõÂ≥ØÂØ∫ Ë•ñÁµµÂÆåÊàêË®òÂøµ ÂçÉ‰ΩèÂçöÂ±ï ÂØåÂ±±ÁúåÁæéË°ìÈ§®„ÄÇ  Books  Museum Hiroshi Senju Museum Karuizawa opened 10 October 2011 in Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture.

It highlights having fun while trialing, offering various game classes. In its rulebook, the CPE philosophy is described: \\"for the dog and handler to have fun while successfully competing for performance titles as a cohesive unit, achieved through positive training and teamwork\\".  Participation requirements  Both purebreds and mixed breeds are allowed to compete, but must be at least 15 months old to compete. A dog's \\"permanent card\\", or \\"P-card\\", signifies the \\"lowest allowable Regular height\\" a dog may jump at. This is based on how tall dog is at the withers as measured by an approved judge, though multiple judges must confirm a measurement in certain cases. Dogs that are blind in both eyes or aggressive cannot compete.  Classes  CPE offers seven separate classes: Standard, Jumpers, Snooker, and Jackpot, which follow the general approach of similar classes in several agility organizations, and Colors, FullHouse, and Wildcard, which are unique to CPE: * Colors: The competitor chooses one of two short, similar numbered courses that intertwine and overlap. * Wildcard: At three places on a numbered course, the competitor chooses which obstacle to perform. * FullHouse: Very similar to Jackpot except that there is no Gamble; instead, the dog must perform a specific quantity of certain types of obstacles (\\"three of a kind, a pair, and a joker\\"), in any order, while accumulating the required number of points.  Jump height  Like those of many other sanctioning bodies, jump heights range from 4 inches to 24 inches in 4-inch intervals: 4 inches, 8 inches, 12 inches, 16 inches, 20 inches, and 24 inches. There are four separate jump height categories: Regular, Veterans, Enthusiast, and Specialist. In Regular, the dog will jump at the height given on its P-card, or higher, which is its measurement at the withers rounded down to the nearest jump height. Veterans and Enthusiast competitors jump 4 inches below their P-card height. Dogs in Specialist classes will jump 8 inches below their P-card height. Regular, Enthusiast, and Specialist are all separate classes with competitors that place separately, while Veterans dogs place in the Regular class.  Class level  Six class levels are offered by CPE. Dogs who have never entered a CPE trial in the past must start at level 1, 2, or 3. Higher level courses may have or require more difficult equipment, such as weave poles. The dog moves up to a higher level by accruing a certain number of qualifying scores (runs that meet the specific time, faults, or points requirements for the specific class and level). Junior handlers (those under 18 years of age) are eligible for several specific titles related to their handling achievements, in addition to competing and placing in standard classes.

He was born on the eve of the arrival of European settlers in the province. After conflict with the Zulu king Mpande, he fled with his people to the Colony of Natal in 1848. During the diamond rush of the 1870s, many of his young men worked on the mines in Kimberley where they acquired guns. In 1873 the colonial authorities of Natal demanded that the guns be registered, Langalibalele refused and a stand-off ensued, resulting in a violent skirmish in which British troops were killed. Langalibalele fled across the mountains into Basutoland, but was captured, tried and banished to Robben Island. He eventually returned to his home, but remained under house arrest. His imprisonment was a watershed in South African political history that split the colonial population of the Colony of Natal.  Context  The Bushmen, a hunter-gatherer people, were the original inhabitants of the modern-day province of KwaZulu-Natal.If the name of a locality in this article had a legal connotation (for example a clearly demarcated border), the nineteenth century name is used, otherwise the post- Apartheid name is used.The prefix \\"kwa\\" means \\"The place\\", thus \\"kwaZulu\\" means \\"The place of the Zulu\\" The prefix \\"ama\\" means \\"The people\\", thus \\"amaHlubi\\" means \\"The Hlubi people\\" The prefix \\"isi\\" means \\"The language of\\", thus \\"isiHlubi\\" means \\"The language of the Hlubi people\\" Historians are divided as to when the Bantu, a pastoral people, first migrated southward into the province, although most think it was well before 1300. By the end of the 17th century they had certainly settled there and displaced the Bushmen who migrated into the foothills of the Drakensberg. The amaHlubi, a Bantu tribe speaking a Tekela dialect had settled in the northern part of the province between the Buffalo and Blood Rivers. A muster and dance of Zulu regiments at Shaka's kraal, as recorded by European visitors to his kingdom, c. 1827. During the first decade of the nineteenth century the Mtetwa chief Dingiswayo, a neighbour of the amaHlubi, set about consolidating the various Nguni people under his leadership. In 1817 he was killed in battle and after a civil war, power passed into the hands of one of his lieutenants, Shaka, chief of the Zulu clan. Shaka expanded the Zulu clan into a tribe, by attacking neighbouring clans and assimilating the survivors; his actions led to The Great Scattering. At the time of Langalibalele's birth, European settlements in Southern Africa were confined to the British controlled Cape Colony and to the Portuguese fortress of Louren√ßo Marques. In 1824 Fynn established a small British settlement at Port Natal (later to become Durban) but the British Government declined to take possession of the port. From 1834 onwards, the Voortrekkers (Dutch-speaking farmers) started to migrate from the Cape Colony in large numbers and in 1837 crossed the Drakensberg into KwaZulu-Natal where, after the murder of one of their leaders, Piet Retief, in the massacre at Weenen they defeated Shaka's successor Dingane at the Battle of Blood River, put Mpanda on the Zulu throne and established the republic of Natalia. Friction between the Voortrekkers and the Pondo, a tribe whose territory lay between Natalia and the Cape Colony led to the British occupying Port Natal, the subsequent Battle of Congella followed by the siege and relief of the port. After the port had been relieved, the Voortrekkers withdrew from KwaZulu-Natal into the interior and the British established the Colony of Natal. The following decades saw the rise of the British industrial base ‚Äì emigration was used to control unemployment and thereby boost the British economy. The Colony of Natal was one destination of such emigrants. In 1856 the colony was granted representative government by the British GovernmentBulpin, T.V. ‚Äì pg 220In the context of British colonial development in the nineteenth Representative Government gave the colony had the right to elect a legislative council to advise the governor, but the governor, as chief executive was not bound to accept their advice with responsible governmentIn the context of British colonial development in the nineteenth Responsible Government gave the colony the right to have a parliament elected by the colonists headed by a prime minister and cabinet with executive responsibility, but with the governor still having the power of veto following in 1895.Bulpin, T.V. ‚Äì pg 413 The British government appointed a \\"Diplomatic Agent\\" who was to act on behalf of the nativeIn order to maintain linguistic consistency with the term \\"native law\\", this article uses the term nineteenth century term \\"native people\\" instead of the twenty-first century term \\"indigenous people\\". people who were subject to \\"native law\\" rather than \\"colonial law\\", \\"in so far as it was not repugnant to the dictates of humanity\\". From 1856 until 1877, the post of Diplomatic Agent was held by Sir Theophilus Shepstone, son of a missionary and who had been brought up at the mission station. King of the amaHlubi The amaHlubi oral tradition asserts that the dynastic line of Langalibalele originated from King Chibi (1300‚Äì1325) who reigned in an area known to the tribe as eMbo, believed to be in the Congo basin. The tribe migrated southwards along with other Bantu tribes and settled in KwaZulu-Natal in about 1650. When Mthimkhulu II became king of the amaHlubi in 1800, he held sway over about in the north-western corner of KwaZulu-Natal. Localities associated with Langalibalele on a modern-day map of KwaZulu-Natal  Early years  Langalibalele (literally \\"the sun is shining\\"),\\"langa\\", the sun, and \\"libalele\\" it is killing [hot]Pearse, R.O. pages 226 ‚Äì 254 the second son of Mthimkhulu II was born in about 1814 and was originally known as Mthethwa. In 1818 Dingiswayo attacked and looted the amaNgwana clan who, to replenish their losses of cattle, attacked the amaHlubi.Bulpin, T.V. ‚Äì page 38 Mthimkhulu died in the ensuing battle and as both Langalibalele and his elder brother Dlomo were children, Mthimkhulu's brother Mahwanqa assumed the regency. Mahwanqa, rather than resolve the differences with the amaNgwana, fled northwards across the Pongola river (northern boundary of KwaZulu-Natal) to the Wakkerstroom area of Mpumalanga with the two boys where he sought sanctuary amongst the amaNgwe. Other members of the tribe fled southwards to Pondoland, or westwards to the Orange Free State and the Basutoland; those fleeing to Basutoland placing themselves under the protection of Chief Molapo. After the assassination of Shaka in 1828, Mahwanqa returned to the amaHlubi's traditional lands. Since Mahwanqa was not subject to Dingane, Shaka's successor, he set about rebuilding his army. Once Dlomo came of age, Mahwanqa was reluctant to relinquish the regency and wished to transfer the chieftainship to Langalibalele, but Mahwanqa's troops revolted and Mahwanqa was slain in the ensuing battle. Dlomo, on taking the chieftainship paid a visit to the Zulu king Dingane at the royal kraal in UmGungundlovu where he argued that the best course would be for him (Dlomo) to retain the chieftainship of the amaHlubi and that Dingane should return his cattle. Dingane however ordered the murder of Dlomo. Thus, in about 1836, Langalibalele became king of the amaHlubi. Under the guidance of Zimane, the great man in the amaHlubi tribe, Langalibalele was circumcised and initiated into the rituals of the tribe. He then took his first wife ‚Äì he was later to take another three wives. Duba, Mini and Luphalule were Langalibalele's half brothers who plotted to have him killed and eaten by the cannibals. Duba asked Langalibalele to accompany him to his mother's place at the amaJuba mountains. Langalibalele was tied to a pole. It is said he was saved by girls who saw Langalibalele and reported the matter to Gxiva, his friend. Gxiva managed to release Langalibalele who escaped during the night and crossed the Mzinyathi river which was in flood. Langalibalele had a long history of escapes including escaping being killed by the Zulu tribe.  Flight to the Natal Colony  In 1848 Mpande summoned Langalibilele to the royal kraal. Langalibalele, mindful of what had happened to his brother, refused, and Mpande, incensed by Langalibalele's refusal, launched an attack. The amaHlubi and the amaPutini fled across the Buffalo River into the Klip River country and Langalibilele appealed to Martin West, the lieutenant governor of Natal for protection. In December 1849, after negotiations in which Shepstone exhibited considerable diplomacy, the amaHlubi, now reduced to 7000 in number, were granted 364 km2 of good land on the banks of the Little Bushmans River, between the newly established European settlement of Bushmans River (Estcourt) and the Drakensberg. It was hoped that the amaHlubi would provide a buffer between the bushmen and the settlers and so protect the settlers' cattle from the bushmen. This area proved too small and within a few years, the Hlubi settlement had spread to over 6000 km2. The British Government required that the colonies be self-supporting in so far as was possible, resulting in various taxes being imposed on all residents. In the 1850s military levies and a hut tax were imposed on the native population who lived within the limits of the Colony. In 1873 a marriage tax of ¬£5 imposed by the colonial government caused much resentment.Walker ‚Äì pg353  The rebellion  The Drakensberg ‚Äì across which Langalibalele escaped The discovery of diamonds in Kimberley, in the British Colony of Griqualand West, attracted thousand of workers, black and white. Many young men from the amaHlubi became labourers on the mines and some were paid in guns rather than in money, a practice that was legal in Griqualand West. The Hlubi labourers habitually brought these guns back to their home in the Natal Colony, upon returning from the mines. In 1873, John Macfarlane, then magistrate in Estcourt, ordered that Langalibalele hand in his people's guns for registration. As Langlibalele did not know who held guns, he refused to enforce the order. Walker records that the government named eight men who were to be ordered to register their guns and that after some hesitation, Langalibalele sent in five of the named eight men.Walker, pg 353 Pearse on the other hand records that Langalibalele himself was ordered to appear before Shepstone, the Secretary for Native Affairs and that Langalibalele refused on grounds of ill health.Pearse, pg 228 In the event, Sir Benjamin Pine, who arrived in the Colony as lieutenant governor in July 1873 ordered the arrest of Langalibalele. Anthony Durnford in 1870. Meanwhile, Langalibalele and his people made plans to flee to Basutoland (modern Lesotho) via the Bushmans River Pass.Coordinates of the localities are: :Bushmans River Pass: :Champagne Castle Pass: :Giants Castle Pass: :Giants Castle: :Hlatimba Pass:: The Natal Colonial government proposed a three-pronged police operation with military support to arrest Langalibalele ‚Äì initially Lieutenant Colonel Miles was to have overall command, but he was not happy with many details and was happy to hand command over to Major Durnford. The plan was for Captain Allison to cross the Drakensberg via the Champagne Castle Pass, some 25 km to the north of the Bushmans River Pass, Captain Barter was to cross the Drakensberg via the Giants Castle Pass, some 10 km to the south of the Bushmans River Pass while other forces would approach Langalibalele's territory from the east. Alison and Barter were to travel under cover of darkness and to meet up at the top of the Bushmans River Pass on Monday 3 November 1873 at 0600 hrs and block Langalibalele's flight. The entire force comprised 200 British troops, 300 Natal Volunteers and about 6000 Africans. To the south, Durnford accompanied Barter and led by native guides followed the route across countryside that much more rugged than expected and they ended up to the south of Giants Castle, not to the north where the pass lay. After a consultation, the guides took the party up the Hlatimba Pass, some 20 km south of the Bushmans River Pass. After negotiating the 2867 m summit of the pass, Durnford and his force consisting of 33 carbineers and 25 Basuto proceeded to the top of the Bushmans River pass where they intercepted the amaHlubi tribesmen 24 hours later than expected. Durnford attempted to negotiate with the tribal elders while Barter and the rest of the party covered him. Some of the British forces lost their nerve and shots were fired. Durnford and his men retreated back down the Hlatimba Pass having lost five of their number. Allison had meanwhile failed to find the Champagne Castle Pass.Pearse, pg 237-41 On 11 November martial law was declared in the Natal colony, and two flying columns, one under Allison, were sent to search for Langalibalele in Basutoland. They entered the protectorate via the Orange Free State and on 11 December reached a spot in the Maluti Mountains that bore evidence of Langalibalele having recently been there. In reality, Langalibalele had thrown himself at the mercy of the Basuto chief Molapo, but Molapo had already handed Langalibalele over to a local force who, on 13 December, handed him and five of his sons over to Allison.Pearse, pg 248-9  Aftermath  Trial and sentence During most of the nineteenth century, the Colony of Natal had two systems of law ‚Äì colonial law which applied to settlers and which was based on Roman Dutch law and native law which applied to the indigenous population and which was based on traditional tribal law. Native law was administered by the indigenous chiefs and, \\"in so far it was not repugnant to the dictates of humanity\\",Walker pg 274 was upheld by colonial magistrates. Indigenous people could, after a lengthy process, apply for exemption from native law. As of 1876, no indigenous people had successfully made such an application. The trial of Langalibalele started on 16 January 1874 and was described by Pearse as a \\"disgrace to British justice\\". Langalibalele was tried under native law with Pine and Shepstone, the chief accusers presiding over the court without the assistance of a Supreme Court judge. Langalibalele was denied the right to have a counsel until the third day of the trial, the counsel was not permitted to interview the prisoner nor was he permitted to cross-examine the witnesses. Langalibalele was sentenced to banishment for life and as the Colony of Natal had no suitable place of detention, the neighbouring Cape Colony to the west was prevailed upon to make Robben Island available for Langalibalele's imprisonment. British Governor Henry Barkly assented and the Chief was immediately transferred.Pearce, pg 251 Bishop Colenso, led the outcry against Langalibalele's banishment Almost immediately after Langalibalele arrived at Robben island, information began to surface across southern Africa about the unfair nature of the Chief's treatment. Doubts were soon raised about the fairness of the trial, and about whether Langalibalele actually intended to rebel at all. John Colenso, first Bishop of Natal, led the outcry. He journeyed to England to plead Langalibalele's case personally and succeeded in getting the case returned to the South African courts. Charles Rawden Maclean (John Ross) wrote a letter to the editor of The Times in support of Langalibalele. In 1824 Maclean had been shipwrecked at Port Natal as a boy and stranded with his companions for four years. In 1827 he walked to Lourenco Marques, some 600 km away to obtained medical supplies. In his letter, Maclean, who had spent much of his time in Southern Africa at Shaka's royal kraal, described that in traditional African society a chief, summoned to the royal kraal in the manner in which Langalibilele had been summoned by the Natal Government, was often executed or at the very least had his cattle and wives confiscated. He also explained that his personal interest in the case was the protection that he had received from Langalibilele's namesake during the latter stages of his journey to Lourenco Marques. The ruling government of the semi-independent Cape Colony soon came to the conclusion that Langalibalele had been unjustly sentenced, though much of the Cape's legislature on the other hand remained wary of the Hlubi chief. The Cape government Minister and spokesman John X. Merriman publicly condemned the trial (\\"Natal Prisoner's Bill\\") and demanded that it be considered illegitimate. The Cape government at the time was dominated by liberals, and their arguments on the matter were twofold. Firstly, they insisted that no white man would have been sentenced so severely, that the Natal court had therefore been guilty of racial prejudice, and that Langalibalele \\"had been victimised because of his colour\\". Secondly, they argued that, as a locally elected government, they neither fell under Natal's jurisdiction, nor were obliged to follow British imperial requests in this regard.P. Lewsen: John X. Merriman. Paradoxical South African Statesman. Johannesburg: Ad. Donker, 1982. , p.45 In response, many stated that they had been entrusted by a neighbouring state with the custody of a prisoner, who, if released, could increase the threat of war on the Cape frontier or Natal. It was argued that Langalibalele had been tried under Native Law, and that this should be honoured, regardless of how harsh the sentence seemed. The resulting bill to have Langalibalele released from Robben island faced opposition in the Cape's Legislature, and only succeeded when the Cape Prime Minister himself threatened to resign if it was not passed.George McCall Theal: History of South Africa, from 1873 to 1884. Twelve Eventful Years. London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd. Ruskin House. Vol. 1. Chapter 10, The Colony of Natal. \\"The Rebellion of Langalibalele\\", pp.236‚Äì237 The pressure to reconsider the sentence grew, and in August 1875, after Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary had finally referred the case back to the courts in the Cape Colony, Langalibalele was allowed to leave Robben Island. He was obliged to remain in the Cape Colony for the time being, until 1887 when he was permitted to return to Natal. On his return to Natal, he was confined to the Swartkop location near Pietermaritzburg. He never regained his power as leader of the Hlubi; he died in 1889 and was buried at Ntabamhlope, 25 kilometres west of Estcourt. In keeping with the amaHlubi tradition, his burial place was kept secret until in October 1950 his grandson revealed the site to the Native Commissioner in Estcourt. Reactions The immediate reaction to the failure to apprehend Langalibalele was an improvement in the colony's security and the search for a scapegoat. Nelson Mandela laid a wreath on Langalibalele's grave Security was improved by the Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir Henry Barkly, sending a contingent of 200 men to Natal while both the neighbouring Boer Republics mobilised men to prevent Langalibalele seeking help for the Zulu king Cetshwayo. With most of the colonists supporting the colonial government,Pearse, p 248 Colenso, who had once been a staunch believer in the expansion of the British Empire bore the brunt of the criticism ‚Äì both his theological views and his liberal views towards the native population were unpopular in the Natal Colony. To a lesser extent Durnford's views that were similar to Colenso's, and although he had held his nerve during the confrontation with the amaHlubi at the top of the Bushmans River Pass, he was ostracised from local society. One of the underlying causes of the Langalibalele \\"rebellion\\" was an inconsistent policy in the various British colonies towards the native populations and in particular the ownership of guns. In the United Kingdom, Lord Carnarvon who returned to the post of Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1874 proposed a confederation of states in Southern Africa, under the control of Britain, but in reality this was a euphemism for a common native policy. While his proposed native policy was too liberal for the Boer republics, it was considered too harsh by the Cape's government, which also rejected the way in which it was to be forcibly imposed on southern Africa from outside. The ill-fated confederation scheme also required the British annexation of the remaining independent states of southern Africa, leading to the Anglo-Zulu War and the First Anglo- Boer War, among other conflicts. In the end, the confederation plan came to naught.Walker, pg 354Diamonds, Gold and War The year before the rebellion, the Cape Colony had been granted responsible governmentWalker, pg 342 and in Natal there was agitation for a similar form of government. The Colonial Office however reviewed the role of native law and in 1875 established the Native High Court which was to rule on matters pertaining to native law.Pearse, p 252 Responsible government did not come to Natal until 1895, over twenty years after the rebellion. Langalibalele's legacy continued into the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. In 1990, shortly after his own release from Robben Island Nelson Mandela laid a wreath on Langalibalele's grave in recognition of Langalibalele's own internment there. In 2005 the amaHlubi people presented a Submission to the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims under the Framework Act to recognise Ingonyama Muziwenkosi ka Tatazela ka Siyephu ka Langalibalele, otherwise known as Langalibalele II as king of the amaHlubi. However, in 2010 the Nhlapo Commission found that since the amaHlubi has been dispersed before the colonial era they did not have a claim to a kingship.

This project is proposed as joint project of Telangana, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh states. Features The project location is downstream of the point where Indravati River joins Godavari river in Karimnagar district of Telangana. The Nizam of erstwhile Hyderabad State made an unsuccessful attempt in the 1860s to build a river crossing weir (during lean flow period similar to one existing at Dummugudem ) here whose remnants are still existing. However, this dream is not yet fulfilled. Inchampalli reservoir is proposed with 10,374 million m¬≥ (367 tmc) gross storage capacity at Full Reservoir Level (FRL) 112.77 m MSL tentatively. This reservoir would submerge total 926 km2 of land in Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states. Most of the area to be submerged is forest land. This project is also envisaged with Pumped-storage hydroelectricity features with tail pond downstream of the dam. Interstate Aspects As per the interstate agreement for Inchampalli joint project, Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana) shall bear 78.1% cost of the dam, land & asset acquisition (including that of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh governments) and rehabilitate the displaced population. But it can draw 2,265 million m¬≥ (80 tmc) from the reservoir and also another 27% (nearly 500 tmc) of water inflows for hydro power generation or irrigation from the reservoir. With this, the only option left for Telangana is to plan lift irrigation projects by using water from the reservoir as most of the cultivable lands in the state are located above the reservoir water level. The interstate agreement is concluded without fixing the FRL of the reservoir and liberty is accorded to Telangana state to decide the FRL keeping cost and benefits sharing percentage same. The agreed terms would be attractive to Telangana only in case the reservoir capacity is of the order of 1,000 tmc. The approximate land submergence is 2,000 km2 for 1,000 tmc capacity reservoir. Inchampalli dam site is very favourable to construct dam economically with nearly 1,000 tmc storage capacity at FRL 125 m MSL. The river at this point covers nearly 80% of the total catchment‚Äôs areaGodavari basin map with adequate water inflows. This is one of very few sites for locating huge storage reservoir in India similar to Aswan Dam (4,600 tmc) in Egypt, Lake Volta (4,200 tmc) in Ghana and Three Gorges Dam (1,350 tmc) in China. Inchampalli reservoir with FRL 125 m MSL would incur very low cost per tmc water storage after meeting the land acquisition and rehabilitation costs at prevailing market rates. Creation of 1,000 tmc storage reservoir at Inchampalli on Godavari River would harness the mighty river water fully ushering India into next phase of green revolution. Alt URL This reservoir project would also eliminate fully the frequent floods taking place in lower Godavari river basin area in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. However, the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh government had tentatively proposed the FRL level 112.77 m MSL, fearing some coal deposits would be submerged above this level. The delay in taking up this project is boon in disguise to Telangana state. Presently underground coal gasification technology is very well developed and in commercial use. This technology is used to exploit coal deposits located deep in the underground (600 meters depth & more), the abandoned underground coal mines and also coal deposits located in seabed. The latest technology adopted from oil & gas wells drilling such as serpentine drilling / in seam drilling, guided drilling, bunching of wells, etc. has made in situ coal gasification technology a reliable and commercial proposition. With underground coal gasification technology, the coal deposits (if any), which got submerged under the reservoir water, can be exploited economically. Moreover, coal deposits are losing importance as this highly pollution causing energy source has become costly compared to abundant and pollution free renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power in India. It would be an economical and time saving proposition if this project is constructed by Telangana first up to 95 m MSL with its full capacity hydro electric station and its submergence area limited to river bed in Maharashtra and Chattishgarh states. Later the height of the dam can be gradually increased to its ultimate height at FRL 125 m MSL with the revenue generated from hydro power generation. Alternatively, Kanthanapally ( ) hydro electric project across the Godavari river located downstream of Inchampalli dam can be constructed up to FRL 95 m MSL with provision to construct Inchampalli dam up to FRL 125 m MSL in future. The reservoir of Kanthalapalli dam would act as tail pond for the pumped storage hydro units of Inchampalli dam in addition to storing substantial river flood water. Alternate dam location: This project's dam location can be shifted to the downstream side at near Thupaklagudem village which is also suitable to construct the dam up to FRL 125 m MSL. At this location, both sides of the river is located in Telangana state which would enable to postpone the interstate disputes resolution and take up dam construction without physical hindrance from Chhattisgarh state. Interstate disputes can be resolved at appropriate time during the advanced stage of dam construction. At this location, the dam construction cost (nearly Rs 3000 crores) up to FRL 125 m MSL is less than 10% of the total project cost which includes land acquisition & rehabilitation of displaced people in the submergence area, irrigation canals, water pumping stations, hydro power station, etc. Devadula lift irrigation scheme would also benefit from the relocated Inchampalli dam as it can directly pump water from the Inchampalli reservoir with reduced power consumption due to availability of water at 125 m MSL from the river. However its pump house needs to be relocated to the uplands side.

Mechanism of action  PLP is employed as it binds to amino groups and stabilises carbanion intermediates. PLP enzymes exist in their resting state as a Schiff base, the aldehyde group of PLP forming a linkage with the epsilon-amino group of an active site lysine residue on the enzyme. The alpha-amino group of the substrate displaces the lysine epsilon-amino group, in the process forming a new aldimine with the substrate. This aldimine is the common central intermediate for all PLP-catalysed reactions, enzymatic and non-enzymatic.  Function  PLP is the active form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine or pyridoxal). PLP is a versatile catalyst, acting as a coenzyme in a multitude of reactions, including decarboxylation, deamination and transamination. A number of pyridoxal-dependent enzymes involved in the metabolism of cysteine, homocysteine and methionine have been shown to be evolutionary related. These enzymes are tetrameric proteins of about 400 amino-acid residues. Each monomer has an active site, which however requires the N-terminal of another monomer to be completed (salt bridges to phosphate and entrance way). The phosphopyridoxyl group is attached to a lysine residue located in the central section of these enzymes and is stabilised by œÄ-stacking interactions with a tyrosine residue above it.  Family members  There are five different structurally related types of PLP enzymes. Members of this family belong to the type I and are: * in the transsulfurylation route for methionine biosynthesis: ** Cystathionine Œ≥-synthase (metB) which joins an activated homoserine ether (acetyl or succinyl) with cysteine to form cystathionine ** Cystathionine Œ≤-lyase (metC) which splits cystathionine into homocysteine and a deaminated alanine (pyruvate and ammonia) * in the direct sulfurylation pathway for methionine biosynthesis: ** O-acetyl homoserine sulfhydrylase (metY) which adds a thiol group to an activated homoserine ether ** O-succinylhomoserine sulfhydrylase (metZ) which adds a thiol group to an activated homoserine ether * in the reverse transsulfurylation pathway for cysteine biosynthesis: ** Cystathionine Œ≥-lyase (no common gene name) which joins an activated serine ether (acetyl or succinyl) with homocysteine to form cystathionine ** Not Cystathionine Œ≤-synthase which is a PLP enzyme type II * cysteine biosynthesis from serine: ** O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (cysK or cysM) which adds a thiol group to an activated serine ether * methionine degradation: * Methionine gamma-lyase (mdeA) which breaks down methionine at the thioether and amine bounds Note: MetC, metB, metZ are closely related and have fuzzy boundaries so fall under the same NCBI orthologue cluster (COG0626).

There are four movements: #Allegretto, in D major #Andante, in A major #Menuetto: Allegretto, in D major with a trio section in G major #Allegretto in D major The quartet was written for and dedicated to the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm II, an amateur cellist, and was written in a similar style to the quartets of Joseph Haydn. Mozart and his friend Karl Lichnowsky met the king in Potsdam in April 1789. Mozart played before the king in Berlin on 26 May 1789, then returned to Vienna. This string quartet is a popular piece in the repertoire today. It is a piece written at the zenith of Mozart's powers as a chamber music composer. It is considered to be in a more relaxed style than the six quartets dedicated to Haydn. A typical performance lasts around 24 minutes.

His account of his long stay in Portuguese captivity in Angola, and his travels in the region are essential primary sources for the history of that region, particularly for his early account of the Imbangala and his detailed description of Loango. Battel was born in Essex about 1565. On 20 April 1589 he sailed with Captain Abraham Cocke for Rio de la Plata. After a troublesome voyage they reached the mouth of the river in the autumn, but were forced by hunger and adverse winds to return along the coast of Brazil. Landing at the island of S√£o Sebasti√£o (the site of the present Rio de Janeiro), the crew was separated, and Battel with five companions was carried off by the Indians to the river Janeiro and delivered to the Portuguese. After four months' imprisonment he was transported to Luanda, the Portuguese settlement in Angola. He was imprisoned in that town for four months, and then sent 150 miles up the Kwanza River and confined in a fort, till, through the death of the Portuguese pilot, he was employed to take the governor's pinnace down to Luanda. After an illness of eight months Battel was sent by the governor of Luanda, Jo√£o Furtado de Mendon√ßa, to Nzari, on the Congo, in a pinnace to collect ivory, wheat, and palm-tree oil. He was successful, and continued to trade for the Portuguese at Loango, but, attempting to escape on a Dutch vessel, he was thrown into prison for two months and then banished to Massangano, a Portuguese fort on the Kwanza River at the eastern end of their domain, where he spent six years. After another abortive flight and consequent imprisonment, he was enrolled in a mixed force of Portuguese and natives and sent on an expedition to Ilambo. In this campaign, which was successful, Battel received a severe wound in the leg. Afterwards he was employed in trading expeditions along the coast, and on one occasion he was left by the Portuguese as a hostage for two months with the Gaga (his rendering of \\"Jagas\\" or Imbangala). He was equipped with a musket, and by his shooting gained the favor of this band. He gives a full and striking account of the strange customs and superstitions which he observed among them, particularly of the human sacrifices of which he was an eye- witness. He managed to return to the Portuguese at Massangano, and for his services was made a sergeant. Hearing from some Jesuits that by the accession of James I peace was restored between England and Spain, he obtained the governor's consent to return to England. The promise was retracted, and Battel fled into the woods of Kasanze, a refugee area north of Luanda, where he resolved to wait for a new governor. At length he fell in with a pinnace belonging to an old messmate; he embarked, and was put down at the port of Loango. Here, by virtue of his shooting, he gained the goodwill of the king. At this point the narrative ends with a full description of the different regions of Loango, their natural features, and the customs of the inhabitants. After three years spent in this district Battel returned to England, having been absent eighteen years, and settled at Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. His veracity has been questioned, but his narratives have been partly confirmed by the similar account of the Congo district given by the traveler Duarte Lopes in 1591. Purchas refers to Battel as his neighbor, and testifies to his intelligence and honesty. He speaks of him as still living in his ‚ÄòPilgrimage,‚Äô the first edition of which was published in 1614.An annotated edition of his Angolan travel was reprinted from both of Purchas' publications, the notes in Purchas, His Pilgrimage (1614); and Purchas His Pilgrims (1625) the latter of which published his own account, edited by E.

He has heard that Al once knew singer Ruby Benton, who he has in vain tried to find out about. Al, who knew Ruby and had a brief but passionate affair with her, tells for the first time the story he has kept to himself for many years. Ruby was singing at a nightclub and entrancing everyone with her voice, but she refuses to move on to the 'big time'. Al even made a recording of her performance, despite Ruby's protests. She later said farewell and vanished, never to be seen again. His theory is that Ruby was an agent sent back from a future time to attract jazz trombonist and nuclear researcher (and possible renegade from the future world) Joel Kurzenknabe. That accomplished, she will return to her own time. Al plays his tape recording. It contains the band that backed Ruby - but there is no voice to be heard.

He became a leading figure in nonconformist circles in Exeter, after moves taken against ministers of unorthodox views in the years before 1720. Early life Enty was the son of John Enty, a travelling tailor in Cornwall, was born in that county about 1675. The boy was working with his father at Tregothnan, the seat of the Boscawen family, when he attracted the notice of a Mrs Fortescue, who sent him to the Taunton Grammar School and thence to the Taunton Academy, under Matthew Warren.The Monthly Repository dated June 1821, vol. XVI, pp. 325-327 Fortified by a recommendation from Warren, he went to preach at Plymouth, some time after the death (15 May 1696) of Nicholas Sherwill, pastor of one of the two presbyterian congregations. Sherwill's place was filled for a short time by his assistant, Byfield, who, according to John Fox (1693‚Äì1763), ‚Äòhad the best sense and parts of any dissenter that ever lived‚Äô in Plymouth. The congregation, however, set aside Byfield and chose Enty, as ‚Äòa bright and serious young man.‚Äô He was ordained at Plymouth on 11 May 1698. Fox disparages his talents, but admits his power of moving the passions and the charm of his musical voice. In 1708 his congregation, numbering five hundred persons, built for him a new place of worship in Batter Street. He married well, and thus acquired means and position. Conservative party In the assembly of united ministers, which met half-yearly at Exeter, Enty sided with the conservative party, and eventually became its leader. He was rather a martinet, and haughty to opponents, but put his friends at ease by the frankness of a simple and kindly nature. He kept an eye on the orthodoxy of candidates for the ministry, but was not a prime mover against James Peirce, the Exeter heretic. After the exclusion of Peirce (1719) Enty was chosen (1720) his successor at James's Meeting. He was succeeded at Plymouth by Peter Baron, who had assisted him from 1700, and was ordained his colleague on 19 July 1704. Exeter Enty spokesman At Exeter Enty became the presiding spirit of the assembly, and its authorised spokesman in the controversy which followed the exclusion of Peirce. His steady adherence to his principles established him in reputation and honour throughout the twenty-three years of his Exeter ministry. He was little of a pastor, confining himself to pulpit duty, taking no exercise, and caring for no amusements. His health remained good till, in May 1743, his constitution was broken by an epidemic. He died on 26 November 1743. Personal life Enty was twice married: first, to ‚Äòan agreeable woman‚Äô of good fortune at Kingsbridge, Devonshire, who died childless. Very soon after her death his old friend, Mrs. Vincent, whose house at Plymouth was ‚Äòthe great inn for all dissenting ministers,‚Äô made up a match between him and Ann, eldest daughter of Savery of Shilston, near Modbury, Devonshire, a dissenting family of county rank. Works Enty wrote: * The Ministry secured from Contempt, 1707 (sermon, on Tit. ii. 15, to the Exeter assembly) * A Defence of the Proceedings of the Assembly at Exeter, 1719 (in reply to Peirce) * Truth and Liberty consistent, 1720 (a further defence, in reply to Peirce's rejoinder) * A Preservative against ‚Ä¶ corruptions of Reveal'd Religion, Exon, 1730. * A Defense of ‚Ä¶ a Preservative, 1730.

Early life Tegg was the son of a grocer, born at Wimbledon, Surrey, on 4 March 1776, and was left an orphan at the age of five. He was sent to a boarding school at Galashiels in Selkirkshire. In 1785 he was bound apprentice to Alexander Meggett, a bookseller at Dalkeith. He ran away, sold chapbooks at Berwick, and spent time at Newcastle where he met the wood engraver Thomas Bewick. In Sheffield he obtained employment from Joseph Gales, the proprietor of the Sheffield Register, and encountered Tom Paine and Charles Dibdin. Further wanderings took him to Ireland and Wales, and then, after some years at King's Lynn in Norfolk, he moved to London in 1796. London \\"Dropsy Courting Consumption\\", published October 25, 1810 in Tegg's Carricatures n¬∞ 45, printed at 111 Cheapside In London he obtained an engagement with William Lane, the proprietor of the Minerva Library, at 53 Leadenhall Street. He subsequently worked for John and Arthur Arch, the Quaker booksellers of Gracechurch Street, where he stayed until he began business on his own account. Tegg took a shop in partnership with Joseph Dalton Dewick in Aldersgate Street. On 20 April 1800 he married, and opened a shop in St. John Street, Clerkenwell, but lost money through the bad faith of a friend. He took out a country auction licence to try his fortune in the provinces. He started with a stock of shilling political pamphlets and some thousands of the Monthly Visitor. With his wife acting as clerk, he travelled and bought up duplicates in private libraries, clearing his debts. Returning to London in 1805, he opened a shop at 111 Cheapside. He printed a series of pamphlets, consisting of abridgements of popular works. They proved successful, and he had up to two hundred titles, many of which sold four thousand copies. By 1840 he had published four thousand works on his own account. The Whole Life of Nelson, which he brought out just after the battle of Trafalgar in 1805, sold fifty thousand copies at 6d. and the Life of Mary Anne Clarke (1810), thirteen thousand copies at 7s. 5d. each. In 1824 he purchased the copyright of William Hone's Everyday Book and Table Book, and, republishing it in weekly parts, made a large profit. He then gave Hone ¬£500 to write The Year Book, which proved less successful. Satirical print from Tegg's Caricature Magazine (1815). When his own publications began paying well he gave up auctions, which he had continued nightly at 111 Cheapside. In 1824 he made his final move, to 73 Cheapside. In 1825 he started the London Encyclopaedia which ran to twenty-two volumes. He bought remainders on a large scale. He was mentioned as a populariser of literature in Thomas Carlyle's petition on the copyright bill in April 1839. In 1835, being then a common councilman of the ward of Cheap, he was nominated an alderman, but was not elected. In 1836 he was chosen Sheriff of London; he paid the conventional fine to escape serving, of ¬£400, and added another ¬£100, founding a Tegg scholarship at the City of London School and donating a collection of books. He died on 21 April 1845, and was buried at Wimbledon. He was generally believed to have been the original of Timothy Twigg in Thomas Hood's 1834 novel Tylney Hall. Works His first short book, The Complete Confectioner, reached a second edition. Tegg was also author of: * Memoirs of Sir F. Burdett, 1804. * Tegg's Prime Song Book, bang up to the mark, 1810; third collection, 1810; fourth collection, 1810. * The Rise, Progress, and Termination of the O. P.

He was born in Rissani, Morocco to Rabbi Meir and Simcha Abuhatzeira, was the grandson of the Baba Sali, Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira, and the brother of Rabbi David Chai Abuhatzeira of Nahariya. He moved to Israel in 1966 and studied at the Porat Yosef Yeshiva. He later moved to Beersheba where he ran a yeshiva. Besides from his reputation as a leading kabbalist, Abuhatzeira was known for his work and influence with business and political leaders and had a following as a spiritual leader. In 2011 he had estimated assets of $80 million. Abuhatzeira was known for wearing a cloak whose long hood covered most of his face, reportedly to shield him from glancing at immodestly dressed women. He had a tunnel dug between his home and his yeshiva where he received people.Abuhatzeira killer sent for psychiatric exam, Jerusalem Post, 30 July 2011 Fraud and tax evasion claims A 1997 investigation by Yossi Bar-Moha for the Haaretz newspaper linked several incidents of corruption to Abuhatzeira, claiming that he tried to impress and persuaded people to pay him in exchange for a blessing and threatened curses. The report also claimed that Abuhatzeira's bank account contained NIS 250 million in gifts and contributions, that he had sold land designated for a girls school and was evading municipal property taxes. A police investigation was launched and in 2003 Abuhatzeira was ordered to pay NIS 100 million to the tax authority on money he received from followers. Following an appeal, a settlement was reached whereby he paid back NIS 20 million to charitable organizations. By 2004 Bar-Moha claimed that the Abuhatzeira's income had grown to NIS 500 million ($141m, 2004), and he filed a joint petition with the Progressive Judaism Movement to the Israeli Supreme Court demanding the tax settlement to be cancelled, but the petition was dismissed.

The prosecutor in Brooklyn subsequently opened an investigation and Abuhatzeira stopped traveling to the United States as a result. Bar-Moha claimed \\"Elazar Abuhatzeira is a charlatan, conman and impostor who takes advantage of people's innocence, exploits them and brings to the verge of poverty\\". His disciples defended him saying that Abuhatzeira is humble and modest and would never do such a thingNatasha Mozgovaya (18 February 2010).

Murder Abuhatzeira was murdered on 28 July 2011 by Asher Dahan of El'ad who stabbed him in the upper body during a private audience. The 42-year-old attacker was said to have been unhappy with marital advice the rabbi had given him. Attempts were made at the scene to resuscitate him, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at the Soroka Medical Center. The funeral was held the next day in Jerusalem and was attended by tens of thousands of people, including Israel's chief rabbis, Haredi ministers and Knesset members.

Members of this family include: CycK from Rhizobium leguminosarum, CcmC from Escherichia coli and Paracoccus denitrificans, and orf240 from Triticum aestivum (Wheat) mitochondria. The members of this family are probably integral membrane proteins with six predicted transmembrane helices that may comprise the membrane component of an ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter complex. This transporter may be necessary for transport of some component needed for cytochrome c assembly. One member, R. leguminosarum CycK, contains a putative haem-binding motif. Wheat orf240 also contains a putative haem-binding motif and is a proposed ABC transporter with c-type haem as its proposed substrate. However it seems unlikely that all members of this family transport haem or c-type apocytochromes because P. denitrificans CcmC transports neither.

Sovacool, published by World Scientific. Sovacool‚Äôs book addresses the current status of the global nuclear power industry, its fuel cycle, nuclear accidents, environmental impacts, social risks, energy payback, nuclear power economics, and industry subsidies. There is a postscript on the Japanese 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Based on detailed analysis, Sovacool concludes \\"that a global nuclear renaissance would bring immense technical, economic, environmental, political, and social costs\\". He says that it is renewable energy technologies which will enhance energy security, and which have many other advantages. The book says the marginal levelized cost for \\"a 1,000-MWe facility built in 2009 would be 41.2 to 80.3 cents/kWh, presuming one actually takes into account construction, operation and fuel, reprocessing, waste storage, and decommissioning.\\"Sovacool, p. 126. In a review by author Mark Diesendorf the book \\"reviews the little-known research which shows that the life-cycle CO2 emissions of nuclear power may become comparable with those of fossil power as high-grade uranium ore is used up over the next several decades and low-grade uranium is mined and milled using fossil fuels\\". Diesendorf says that one weakness of the book is the limited coverage of nuclear weapons proliferation. He says that governments of several countries (e.g., France, India, North Korea, Pakistan) have used nuclear power and/or research reactors to assist nuclear weapons development or to contribute to their supplies of nuclear explosives from military reactors.

Battle Israeli F-4s and Mirage IIICs approached Al-Mazzah airport to conduct a series of raids to neutralize the bases capable of launching attacks over Israeli airspace. Shortly after crossing into Syrian airspace, the Israeli formations came under heavy fire by Soviet-made Syrian Air Force MiG-21s. The Israeli pilots managed to shoot down two of the MiG-21s and then concentrated their attack on the airbase itself. Using the Mirage IIIC's bombing capabilities, they were able to crater the runways and inflict light ground losses. During the raid a MiG-21 shot down an F-4 Phantom; both the pilot and the navigator survived, but they crashed on hostile ground near the airbase, and shortly after that were rescued by IDF forces. Another F-4 Phantom was severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire from the airbase; the plane was escorted back to Israeli airspace, and safely returned home. Aftermath Following the attack, a battle erupted between the IDF and Syrian forces, as the IDF attempted to rescue a pilot and a navigator who ejected from their F-4 Phantom II during the raid. One F-4 Phantom II was crippled during the engagement, but was escorted back to safety despite repeated efforts by the Syrian Air Force to shoot down the crippled aircraft. The raid was primarily an Israeli victory as they sustained minimal losses, compared to the losses of the Syrian Air Force, which lost the airbase and two MIG-21's.

ISMETT was founded in 1997 as a partnership between the Region of Sicily, the Civico and Cervello hospitals in Palermo, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).Istituto Mediterraneo per i Trapianti e Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (ISMETT) ISMETT primarily specializes in performing all types of organ transplantations,Trapianti e terapie using both deceased and living donor techniques. ISMETT has 70 beds (14 ICU, 21 in semi-intensive, and 35 inpatient), 7 outpatient beds, 4 operating rooms, a hospital pharmacy and laboratory analysis, infectious diseases and pathology in a facility that covers an area of . History The idea of creation of the Institute stemmed from a group of hepatologists at a hospital in Palermo that proposed to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) the idea of a multi-organ transplant center to be realized in Sicily. Its creation was also prompted by a 1995 law passed in the United State that capped the total number of foreign patients that can be placed on a waiting list for transplants at 5%. For this reason, transplant leaders in Pittsburgh began looking toward opportunities in Europe and participated actively in the creation of a transplant center in Palermo. On May 23, 1996, the idea was presented to the Ministry of Health, who welcomed the project. The first director was Ignazio R. Marino who performed the first successful liver transplantation in Sicily on July 31st, 1999. Ignazio Marino's team performed the first 100 solid organ transplantations of ISMETT. On March 20, 1997, the State-Region Conference officially approved the creation and clinical management of ISMETT in accordance with art. 9/bis of Legislative Decree no. 502/92 and proceeded with construction of the new institute. The construction began in 1999 with the laying of a foundation stone and was completed in 2004 when the new center opened its doors. As of 2007, ISMETT had revenues of ‚Ç¨ 2,270,000. Its chairman was Camillo Ricordi, with Bruno Gridelli serving as its director-general and Ugo Palazzo serving as its director of health Transplant activities ISMETT began its clinical activity in 1999. On July 31, 1999 Ignazio Marino performed its first liver transplant from a cadaveric donor in Sicily.Mille trapianti all'Ismett di Palermo. Marino: ¬´√à il centro dei miei sogni¬ª, Corriere del Mezzogiorno, October 8, 2010 The same year Ignazio Marino started a cadaveric and living donor kidney transplantation program. The team lead by Ignazio Marino performed the first 100 solid organ transplant at ISMETT. In 2004, ISMETT obtained permission to perform heart-lung transplants, thus becoming a multi-organ transplant center. In 2003 ISMETT started a pediatric liver transplantation program, and that year performed the first children's transplant done in southern Italy.Tiziana Lenzo, Nove anni, un fegato nuovo √® il primo trapianto nel Sud, la Repubblica, 5 luglio 2003 Transplantation of HIV+ patients In 2001, Ignazio Marino performed the first living donor transplant into and HIV-positive patient in Italy, a procedure that created controversy and criticism,Tano Gullo, Ismett, dopo il trapianto una pioggia di richieste, la Repubblica, 30 agosto 2001 including complaint from the Ministry of Health. The Ministry moved to censure Marino arguing that this particular type of transplant had the characteristics of clinical trials that required special authorization. That patient transplanted by Dr. Marino is still alive and enjoying an excellent quality of life free of dialysis, 16 years after the kidney transplant. Because of this success the rules in Italy have been changed and now HIV-positive patients are not any longer denied access to transplantation if they need it. In 2007, for the first time in the world, an ISMETT team led by Dr. Bruno Gridelli performed a lung transplant on an HIV positive patient Trapianto polmoni su sieropositivo. E' la prima volta al mondo, la Repubblica, 25 maggio 2007 In this case, the intervention was authorized by the Ministry and was included within an experimental program launched by the National Transplant Center. This time, no controversy was recorded and the procedure received congratulatory press. The Cell Factory In 2007, the Regenerative Medicine and Cell Therapy Unit (Unit√† di Medicina Rigenerativa e Terapie Cellulari), termed the Cell Factory, was opened at ISMETT with the aim to initiate a program of regenerative medicine that researches the reparation of damaged organs.Cell factory - Unit√† di Medicina rigenerativa The mobile production laboratories (GMP Facility) of the unit have been made part of a project sponsored by the Region of Sicily and the Budget and Finance under the \\"ICT for the excellence of the territories.\\" Among the research trials carried out at the Cell Factory is the injection of fetal hepatocytes as a therapy to bridge the patients waiting for a liver transplant, transplantation of pancreatic islets for patients with diabetes type 1, and transplantation of human fetal skin cells for the treatment of lesions of the skin. The Center for Simulation The Center for Simulation became active at ISMETT in June, 2007Centro di Simulazione with the aim to prevent and reduce medical errors. The use of simulation for training staff is already quite widespread in certain sectors such as aviation, and has now spread into the medical field. The simulation center provides for the implementation of higher risk procedures without risk to personnel and without involving patients. The center has five life-sized and technologically sophisticated simulator mannequins that can mimic the signs and symptoms of real patients. The center was created thanks to a donation from the Foundation Fiandaca. The training activities of the Centre, which is open to all health care providers, began in January, 2008 .

It is affiliated with the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin of the Armenian Apostolic Church. It was first built in the year 1688 and rebuilt in 1724 on the old cemetery of the Armenian community, through the efforts of Agha Nazar after the original wooden structure perished in a fire in 1707. The belfry of the Holy Nazareth General information The Holy Nazareth Church is located in the northwest corner of Burrabazar in the Central Kolkata area. In the years 1995 to 1997 the Calcutta Armenians applied to the Calcutta High Court to become independent of the Apostolic Church of Etchmiadzin and the High Court by order of Justice S. K. Hazari ordered that the Church and Armenian community would be independent of the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is possibly the oldest church in the Kolkata area. It was rebuilt in 1724 by Agha Jakob Nazar after a fire destroyed the previous Armenian church that had been built on the land in 1688. The first Armenians who settled in India, who were renowned merchants and traders and they built strong community structures including alms houses, chapels and schools to benefit the local Armenians. The early traders signed agreements with the British East India Company codifying their cultural, religious and trading rights. The entire Calcutta Armenian Community, barring a few, were all descendants of the Armenians of Julfa now in Iran. Very few had connections with Armenia or the Etchmiadzin Apostolic Church. Religious opinions and interventions were sought from the Church authorities of Julfa and very little or no contact was made with Etchmiadzin. The Church at no 2, Armenian St, Calcutta 700001 is known to be the oldest Christian church in Calcutta. There are two chapels. St. Mary's Chapel is situated in the Tangra area of east Calcutta. The chapel of rest of St. Gregory, also known to the local Armenians as the 'small church', is situated in the Park Circus area of Calcutta. The Armenian Churches of Calcutta are managed under High Court orders in suit no 413 of 1888 ‚Äì John Gregory Apcar and others versus Thomas Malcolm and Sir Gregory Charles Paul, the Advocate General of Bengal. The Church of St. John at Chinsurah is also managed under the same order of the High Court of Calcutta in Suit no 413 of 1888. All the properties. movable and immovable, of the Armenian trusts for Calcutta Armenians are owned and managed by the government through the Official Trustee. The cemetery, dotted with potted plants, is perhaps most famous for being the final resting place of Rezabeebeh Sookia. Her grave dates back to 1630, which makes it the oldest Christian grave in Kolkata, and proves that the arrival of the Armenians to the city predates that of the English in 1690. The church's interior is decorated with marble. A staircase leads to a galleries section where the walls are adorned with inset frescoes and paintings. The altar in the church is adorned with a cross, the Gospel text and twelve candlesticks symbolising Jesus Christ's Twelve Apostles. The altar is also decorated with three paintings by English artist AE Harris, \\"Holy Trinity\\", \\"Last Supper\\" and \\"The Enshrouding of Our Lord\\". The Church at Armenian st was built over an Armenian graveyard and grave stones of the Calcutta Armenians surround the Church on all sides and some gravestones can even be found inside the Church. On the east side of the Churchyard the remains of an Armenian Persian type bath can be found on a boundary wall of Hamam St. 'Hamam' is the Persian word for 'bath'. The main Church at no. 2, Armenian St. has been used for a few services for worshippers of other Orthodox Churches such as the Syrian and Russian orthodox communities  History  On 22 June 1688, the British East India Company signed a contract with the Armenians residing in India. The contract was signed by Sir Josiah Child, who represented the East India Company; and Khoja Sarhad and Khoja Fanush, who represented the Armenian community in Bengal. In accordance with the agreement, the East India Company had to build churches throughout India in areas that were inhabited by at least 40 Armenians, with the provision of 50 pounds as a salary for the priests in those churches. In 1708, which is officially considered the founding date of the church (although 1705 and 1707 have also been given as dates by sources), the East India Company built a small wooden church on what is now the site of the southeast wing of the Church of Holy Nazareth. In 2008, it celebrated its tercentenary. Later, an Armenian named Aga Nazar (Jakob Nazar) raised money and built the church in 1724. The present church building was built in 1764 by Aga Mamed Hazar Maliyar on land donated by an Armenian named Kenanentekh Phanoosh, and was designed by Kavond (or Hevond) from Persia. The interior of the church was designed by Catchick Arakiel. Arakiel also built a monastery for priests and erected a high wall around the cemetery. In addition, he donated a clock to be fitted in the church structure. In 1790, Catchick Arakiel attached a room to the clergy and set the clock on the belfry. The expensively decorated interiors, including a combination of black and white marble, were placed with the support of wealthy Armenians, such as Sir Catchick Paul Chater. The outer buildings were all built at the expense of wealthy Calcutta Armenians such as Arathoon Stephen, builder and owner of the world-famous Calcutta GRAND HOTEL.

In 2009, Halda was given new life at the initiative of the watch entrepreneur and engineer Mikael Sandstr√∂m  History   Halda, Sweden's first pocketwatch factory  Halda was founded in 1887 by the factory owner Henning Hammarlund (1857-1922) in order to primarily produce pocket watches. Its name is formed by a contraction of the founder's surname -Hammarlund( a). Hammarlund had, after an education in particularly Switzerland, returned to Sweden determined to start a Swedish pocketwatch factory. The location of this purpose he found in the small community of Sv√§ngsta by M√∂rrums√•n in Blekinge. The first pocketwatches, Haldauren was presented 1889. In 1893, they were rewarded two medals at the World Exhibition in Chicago. In 1890, Halda also began to produce typewriters and taximeters.  The company split  To cope with the ever-decreasing demand for pocket watches during World War I, Hammarlund developed new ideas for the manufacturing of typewriters and taxi meters. After financial problems however, the pocket watch production was put down in 1917 (about 8,000 pocket watches was manufactured from 1888 to 1917) and in 1920 the company was liquidated. Instead, a new company, AB Halda Fabriker, took over the manufacturing of typewriters. The successful production of taximeters, took the Fabriks AB Halda taximeter (which is the origin of today's Haldex AB (gearboxes, four-wheel drive, etc.) and Halda Trancometer AB (taximeters)) and production was moved to Halmstad.  ABU takes over the pocket watch manufacturing  Even the production of pocket watches lived on under the watchmaker Carl Borgstr√∂m's housing, an employee of the Halda Fickursfabrik since 1904. Borgstr√∂m bought up the remaining stock of watch parts and some machinery and again, along with some watchmakers from Fickursfabriken, started produce watches. The company, AB Urfabriken (ABU), came to produce pocketwatches until 1926 and then included fishing equipment. ABU, now ABU- Garcia AB, is still located in Sv√§ngsta.  AB √Ötvidaberg Industries take over typewriter manufacturing  AB Halda Fabriker went bankrupt in 1927 each after the company name was changed again, this time to Halda AB. The business grew throughout the 1930s. In 1938 Halda was taken over by AB √Ötvidabergs Industrier and converted to a subsidiary under the name Facit-Halda AB. Halda, however, had remained as a typewriter brand in the √Ötvidaberg Group to the year 1957 when it switched to Facit AB. During the early 1970s, over 1,000 employees worked at the factory in Sv√§ngsta. During the late 1970s and 1980s, business was worse, and in 1987 (the same year as Halda turned 100 years old) the former owner, Ericsson announced that they sold Facit to the Norwegian Design Data. Facit Holding AB was formed in connection with this. Despite the production of electronic typewriters and focus on manufacturing personal computers and printed circuit boards the company's position deteriorated further. At the end of 1992-1993, the company went bankrupt, and the typewriter production in Sv√§ngsta was put down.  The brand resumes  In 2009, Halda was given new life at the initiative of the watch entrepreneur and engineer Mikael Sandstr√∂m who developed a new watch with an innovative concept of a time-platform and two interchangeable time-modules. The 21st century Halda-watches are based on the same drive that Henning Hammarlund established: there is never room for compromise in quality or function. In developing the first modern Halda-watch, the company worked with the Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang who tested the watch on his space mission, STS-128.  Trip computers  Using their knowledge of taximeters the company created a series of trip computers for use in rallying.Motor Rally: The Magic Box, March 1956 The Halda Speedpilot was called \\"a considerable advance upon anything of the kind previously marketed, as regards usefulness, compactness, mechanical simplicity (and hence reliability), simplicity of operation and price\\" by Autosport.Autosport: A Most Accurate Average Speed Computer , March 9, 1956  References   External links  * Category:Manufacturing companies of Sweden Category:Watch manufacturing companies Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1887 Category:Typewriters Category:Swedish brands Category:Watch brands Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1993 Category:Re-established companies Category:Manufacturing companies established in 2009 Category:2009 establishments in Sweden Category:Swedish companies established in 1887 Category:Swedish companies disestablished in 1993 Category:Swedish companies established in 2009 ","title":"Halda"},{"id":"32570000","text":"The ocellated turbot (Pleuronichthys ocellatus) is a flatfish of the family Pleuronectidae.

In 1818 Bernard Seurre won the Prix de Rome for sculpture with a relief on the subject Chilonis imploring mercy for her husband CleombrotusCleombrotus married Chilonis, daughter of Leonidas II, king of Lacedemonia, and shortly after the marriage usurped Leonidas' throne and condemned him to exile. Cleombrotus did not last long in power and the Lacedomnians, tired of his tyrannical government, recalled Leonidas. He returned and wanted to punish Cleombrotus, who took refuge in the temple of Neptune. Leonidas went to the temple with friends and soldiers intent on killing Cleombrotus, but Chilonis took one of her children to see Leonidas and asked for mercy from him. (Plutarch, Life of Agis, chapters 16-18) He then produced sculptures for the Arc de Triomphe between 1833 and 1836 and produced a design for a sculpture on top of it in 1833 (though this was never realized).

ASCAME was founded on 1 October 1982. The Constitutive General Assembly was held in Barcelona, hosted by the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation. Nowadays, ASCAME is the main representative of the Mediterranean private sector with a network of over 300 Chambers of Commerce from the 23 countries of the Mediterranean basin. ASCAME is a consolidated entity that represents the interest of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and the Mediterranean private sector, also being accredited as an economic partner of the European Union and other international organisations in carrying out economic cooperation projects. ASCAME represents North and South Chambers and businesses regardless of their size and sector of activity. History The Association of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ASCAME) was founded on October 1, 1982, as an initiative of the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with its counterparts from different Mediterranean countries. From the about ten founding members of 1982, today ASCAME brings together over 300 hundred Chambers of Commerce and similar institutions, from 23 Mediterranean countries. ASCAME was created with the primary goal of furthering economic cooperation throughout the Mediterranean region, showing a strategic vision of North-South cooperation and integration. This vision was confirmed in Barcelona by the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in 1995. Nowadays, 30 years since its inception, this strategic vision has been strongly reinforced. Through ASCAME, the private sector is positioned in the regional political agenda to catalyst solutions that can answer accordingly to the changing socioeconomic scenarios in the region. Objectives According to article 3 of the Statutes, ‚ÄúThe fundamental purpose of this Association is to establish permanent contacts and forge lasting relationships among its members in order to co-ordinate, implement and promote studies and joint actions with a view to developing economic exchanges and co-operation within the Mediterranean area of international scope.‚Äù The objectives that the association wants to achieve are: * Establishment of a network of Chambers of Commerce and organisations working in the field of cooperation and economic exchange between countries in the Mediterranean region * Promotion and search of synergies between these countries' economies * Creation of working ties between peer institutions aimed at encouraging international cooperation through joint performance of activities and/or studies * Assertion of the Mediterranean identity * Contribution to build an area of peace, tolerance, security and prosperity ASCAME serves as a unique instrument for the socioeconomic development of the region through: * A close collaboration with the most important organisations and international institutions of the Mediterranean region * The promotion of regional and international economic activities * The involvement in Euro-Mediterranean cooperation projects Members The Association envisages two types of membership: Full Members, which are Chambers of Commerce and Industry of countries riparian to the Mediterranean, and Associate Members, which are the various Mediterranean institutions and organisations having a relationship with the objectives of ASCAME. Today, around 75% of its members are Chambers of Commerce and Industry from different Mediterranean countries and around 10% are national Chambers of Commerce and bilateral Chambers of Commerce. Nearby 10% of its members are business representative organisations, employees‚Äô organisations and associations for economic promotion. The rest of members are port authorities, promotion agencies and fairs, among others. ASCAME has currently members from Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Croatia, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Macedonia, Malta, Morocco, Palestine, Serbia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. Organisation ASCAME's operating structure consists of: * General Assembly. The General Assembly is composed of all members. Its main task is to define the general policy and major lines of the activity of the Association. * Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is the permanent management and administrative body of ASCAME.

Don Li Life and music Born into a family of graphic artists, he played drums, piano and saxophone as a child and started writing his own compositions at the age of 16. As a young saxophonist he played with George Gruntz, Christy Doran, Harald Haerter and Joseph Bowie, among others. He presented most of his compositions with his sextet \\"Tonus\\" (1993‚Äì2002), which consisted of the musicians Mich Gerber (1997‚Äì1998), Nik B√§rtsch (1996‚Äì2002), Bj√∂rn Meyer (1998‚Äì2002), Werner Hasler (1995‚Äì2002), Marco Agovino (1993‚Äì2002) and Patrick Lerjen (1993‚Äì2002). The album Gen, released in 1999, which forgoes all solo contributions and thus intensifies to become a mesmerizing 27-minute suite, has particularly been acclaimed by reviewers. With respect to rhythm, sound and concept, Gen presents nearly all elements which characterize the essence of Tonus-Music. In 1999, Don Li founded the music label Tonus-Music- Records and began publishing recordings of various musicians. In 2000, he established the Tonus-Music Laboratory in Bern (Since 2012 renamed as Orbital Garden), which functions as a recording studio and public experimental lab as well as a workshop and teaching location; it also serves as a performance site mostly for interdisciplinary and unorthodox performances ‚Äì such as a 48-hour non-stop drumbeat performance. He has used the lab to work with, among others, Jojo Mayer, Sk√∫li Sverrisson, Pierre-Yves Borgeaud, Peter Scherer, Ania Losinger, Christian Zehnder, Vidya Shah, Milind Raikar, Sanju Sahai, Kaspar Rast, Asita Hamidi, Bj√∂rn Meyer, Andi Pupato, Norbert Pfammatter, Nik B√§rtsch, Sha, and Zimoun as well as to stage various concerts, exhibitions, lectures and installations. He has also done recordings of the groups of Fabian Kuratli (Fab Four), Asita Hamidi, B√§nz Oester, Nik B√§rtsch (Mobile) or Christian Zehnder. His \\"Tonus-Music\\" concept combines a composing method that relies on reductive discipline and an almost graphic architecture which incorporates components of Indian classical music, jazz, minimal electronics, or funk. He is interested in metric, interlocking and balancing elements of rhythmic structures in combination with musical asceticism. He has been serially numbering his compositions (parts), which often consist of a single formula, ever since; he compares them with Japanese Haikus and calls them musical sculptures. \\"It has been seven years now since the saxophonist, clarinettist, composer, band leader and organizer Don Li ... published the twenty-six- minute-long CD , a relatively short prelude to a phenomenon which breaks the mold of purely musical categories.\\" Georg Modestin, der Bund 2006 Since 2005, his works have been dealing with the conscious, chronological structuring of time and, in synchronization with the PC, last exactly 60 minutes (Orbital Garden). Awards In 2006, Don Li received a commission from Pro Helvetia, and in 2006 After receiving a New York scholarship from the city of Bern (2002), he was given the option to cooperate in the grant \\"Werkjahr der Stadt Bern\\". In 2008 he was awarded the German Record Critics‚Äò Prize (Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik).

Its site was occupied by a fountain known as the fontaine Richelieu until 1838, when it was demolished due to interfering with traffic flow. Joseph R√©gnier, a member of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, suggested a new fountain set back slightly from the previous fountain's site as a monument to the playwright Moliere. This was France's first national public subscription for a commemorative monument dedicated to a non-military figure. Built in 1844, the fountain was designed by several sculptors, headed by the architect Louis Tullius Joachim Visconti, who also designed the fountain in place Saint- Sulpice. The main bronze sculpture, showing Moliere seated under a portico under an imposing arch, is by Bernard-Gabriel Seurre (1795‚Äì1875) and cast by the fonderie Eck et Durand. Under him is an inscription flanked by two marble female sculptures by Jean-Jacques Pradier (1792‚Äì1852), 'Serious Comedy' and 'Light Comedy' - each holds a scroll listing Moliere's works. Right at the bottom are lion masks, from which the water pours into a semi-circular basin. A commemorative medal for the fountain's inauguration was designed by Fran√ßois Augustin Caunois in 1844 - an example of it is in the mus√©e Carnavalet (ND 0367).

It denotes a portion of a reservoir that contains economically recoverable hydrocarbons. The term derives from the possibility of \\"paying\\" an income surpassing the costs. Equivalent terms are pay sand or pay zone. Overall interval in which pay volumes occur is the gross pay; smaller portions of the reservoir that meet further criteria for pay (such as permeability and hydrocarbon saturation) are net pay. Net pay is determined through placing cut offs on properties like permeability, porosity, water saturation or volume of shale. Care needs to be taken to cut out the part of the gross rock volume that has the ability to allow fluids to flow and actually stores hydrocarbons. In other cases when determining \\"Net Reservoir\\" the remaining rock is that rock that can still store flow hydrocarbons but is not necessary containing hydrocarbons.

A student of Fran√ßois Joseph Bosio and baron Gros, he is now most noted for his bronzes. He first exhibited in 1824, in a show of classical and mythological subjects. From 1830 he shifted to smaller sculptures and animal subjects, like Antoine- Louis Barye, another student of Bosio and Gros. He also had a talent for historical scenes with figures in elaborate costumes. Gechter's penchant and gift in depicting historical scenes reached new heights when in 1833 he exhibited his Combat of Charles Martel and Abderame, King of the Saracens. The bronze work was commissioned by the ministry of commerce and industry. Gechter's motif of dressing his subjects in elaborate dresses and depicting scenes of battles or hunts from the Renaissance could be considered as belonging to the genre known as troubadour. But the uniqueness of Gechter was that he managed to infuse emotions into the genre. Examples of this are Death of Tancred (1827) and Wounded Amazon (1840). This exceptional ability resulted in numerous public commissions. He created a marble relief of the Battle of Austerlitz (1833‚Äì6) for the Arc de Triomphe and a marble statue of Louis Philippe, which was commissioned in 1839.

Joe Morris Sr. (April 19, 1926 ‚Äì July 17, 2011) was an American World War II United States Marine veteran and Navajo code talker. Morris was born as one of four children on April 19, 1926, in Indian Wells, a village on the Navajo Nation in northeast Arizona, as a member of the Kin'lichii'nii Clan. He took care of his parents horse, sheep and livestock. According to the Los Angeles Times, Morris described the reservation where he was raised as having \\"no electricity, no running water, no school.\\" He began attending a government-run boarding school approximately 70 milies from his home when he was twelve years. Morris was taught English at the school. Morris' school was closed at the outbreak of World War II and the building was turned into a Japanese-American internment camp. Morris told the U.S. draft board in 1943 that he was 18 years old, when he was actually 17 years old, in order to get his draft card. He worked on in an ore mine in Arizona for several months before he was drafted into the United States Marines. In a 1988 interview with the Modesto Bee, Morris said that a Navajo medicine man prayed for him for a day and a half upon his drafting, which Morris credited with surviving the war unharmed. Morris was sent to Camp Pendleton, where he and approximately 400 other Navajos received communications training to become code talkers. Morris served as a Marine code talker throughout the Pacific Theater, serving with the 2nd Marine Regiment, 6th Marine Division, including Guadalcanal and Guam. He was a participant in the Battle of Okinawa, where the Japanese blocked the Navajo's messages. In 2004, Morris told a Veterans Days observance in San Bernardino, California, that \\"My weapon was my language...We saved a lot of lives.\\" At the end of World War II, Morris was told by his commanders not to speak of the Navajo code talkers with anyone. That included Morris' parents and wife, whom he did not tell either. Morris began revealing the details of the Navajo code talkers only the code talkers' mission and role in the war was declassified in 1968. Morris was honorable discharged from the Marines in 1946 and married his wife, Charlotte Morris. He was hired at a Marine supply center in Barstow, California, and settled in the small town of Daggett, a small town in the Mojave Desert. He worked as a maintenance department supervisor at the same supply center until his 1984 retirement. Joe Morris spoke extensively about the experience of the Navajo code talkers during the 1990s and 2000s (decade). Morris and his fellow Navajo code talkers were honored by in an exhibit at the Pentagon in 1992, which he attended. Morris also attended Congressional Gold Medal ceremony in 2001, in which President George W. Bush presented the award to four or the original twenty-nine Navajo code talkers. He and 200 surviving code talkers were awarded the Congressional Silver Medal on November 25, 2001, at a ceremony in Window Rock, Arizona. Joe Morris Sr. died from complications of a stroke on July 17, 2011, at Jerry L. Pettis Memorial VA Medical Center in Loma Linda, California, at the age of 85. President of the Navajo Nation Ben Shelly ordered American flags on the Navajo Nation to be lowered to half staff in Morris' honor.

After the murder of Johann Joachim Winckelmann in 1768, Visconti succeeded him as the Papal States' Superintendent of Antiquities (Commissario delle Antichita), a post which he retained until his death in 1784. His main task was to reorganise and secure new acquisitions for the Vatican Museums and he became the first curator of the Museo Pio-Clementino, commissioning its neoclassical form. He also controlled the granting of export-licences to archaeologists and dealers throughout the Papal States - such as Gavin Hamilton and Thomas Jenkins. A first volume of his catalogue of the Vatican collections appeared under his name in 1782; which was continued after his death by his son, Ennio Quirino Visconti. In his old age he was helped by both his sons, Ennio Quirino Visconti and Filippo Aurelio Visconti. He died on 2 September 1784. After his death his son, Filippo Aurelio, succeeded his father as Commissario and in 1785 was made director of the Musei Capitolini. Ennio Quirino eventually became director of the Musee Napoleon in Paris, to which many antiquities from Italy had been carried off by Napoleon. Further reading * I. Bignamini, C.

In that match, Nevill made 18 and 0 and took one catch. In March 2012, he was called up to the Australian squad during the team's tour of the West Indies, in place of Brad Haddin to tend to his sick daughter, Mia, although he did not play a game on the tour.Daniel Brettig (2012). \\"Nevill and Haddin trade places again\\" ‚Äì ESPNcricinfo. Published 16 March 2012. Retrieved 25 October 2013. On 16 January 2017, Nevill was hit in the face by a cricket bat during the 2016‚Äì17 Big Bash League match between the Melbourne Renegades and the Adelaide Strikers. The bat slipped out of the hands of Brad Hodge and hit Nevill breaking his cheekbone. 2017‚Äì18 season Nevill played for New South Wales in the 2017‚Äì18 JLT One-Day Cup. On 8 October, Nevill equalled the record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in a List A game in the match between New South Wales and Cricket Australia XI. Across six matches in the tournament he was involved in 19 dismissals. International career Nevill was selected to go to England for the 2015 Ashes series, and made his Test debut for the second Test at Lord's after Brad Haddin made himself unavailable for selection due to family reasons. His baggy green cap was presented by Steve Waugh. Nevill finished with seven catches on debut, and seven dismissals overall, to be tied for second for catches overall, but an Ashes debut record.Fielding records from Statsguru He also scored 45 runs in the first innings, just missing his first half-century on debut, however he went on to score 57 in the second innings of his third Test at Edgbaston. On 9 January 2016, Nevill made his debut for Melbourne Renegades as teammate Matthew Wade, Australia's limited-overs wicket-keeper was called up for international duties. Nevill ran himself out after Adam Zampa was hit on the nose off his deflection from a shot from Dwayne Bravo, as it went on to hit the stumps. On 9 February 2016, a day after Australia lost the Chappell-Hadlee series to New Zealand, Nevill was named as the wicketkeeper of choice for ICC World T20 after Matthew Wade was dropped for poor glovesmanship. Despite given his modest batting average, it was speculated that with a deep T20 batting lineup, the side could afford a specialist wicket-keeper. Batting against Sri Lanka in July 2016, Peter Nevill along with Steve O'Keefe set the record for the slowest partnership in the history of test cricket for any wicket with a scoring rate of just 0.13 for the 9th wicket (4 runs off 174 balls). In November 2016, Nevill was dropped from the Test side after the second Test of the South Africa series and replaced with Matthew Wade. A week later he made 179* in a Sheffield Shield match.

Audio quality metrics cover a wide variety of parameters, including level, gain, noise, harmonic and intermodulation distortion, frequency response, relative phase of signals, interchannel crosstalk, and more. In addition, many manufacturers have requirements for behavior and connectivity of audio devices that require specific tests and confirmations. Audio analysis requires that the device under test receive a stimulus signal of known characteristics, with which the output signal (response) may be compared by the analyzer in order to determine differences expressed in the specific measurements. This signal may be generated or controlled by the analyzer itself or may come from another source (e.g., a recording) as long as characteristics relative to the desired measurement are defined. As test and measurement equipment, audio analyzers are required to provide performance well beyond that of the typical devices under test (DUTs). High quality audio analyzers must demonstrate vanishingly low levels of noise, distortion and interference in order to be deemed worthwhile, and must do so consistently and reliably to be trusted by engineers and designers. For example, while a commercial CD player can achieve a total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) ratio of approximately ‚àí98 dB at 1 kHz, a high quality audio analyzer may exhibit THD+N as low as ‚àí121 dB (this is the specified typical performance of the Audio Precision APx555). Audio Analyzers find use in both development and production of products. A design engineer will find it very useful when understanding and refining product performance, while a production engineer will wish to perform tests to rapidly confirm that units meet specifications. Very often audio analyzers are optimized for one of these two cases. Current popular audio analyzer models include: APx585 and APx555 (from Audio Precision), dScope M1 and Series III (from Spectral Measurement, formerly Prism Sound), AverLAB (from Avermetrics), U8903A (from Agilent) and the UPP and UPV analyzers (from Rohde & Schwarz). Audio Precision APx525, a current audio analyzer HP 8903B, an audio analyser of mid-1980s History One of the earliest reliable sources used for audio test was the first product made by Hewlett-Packard in 1939, the HP200A audio oscillator. The clever and inexpensive design of the HP200A allowed testers to generate very high quality, low distortion sine waves that could be used for testing. This was followed by the company's introduction of the HP320A and HP320B Distortion Analyzers in 1941. These early analyzers could only determine total harmonic distortion and noise combined, and worked by employing a steep notch filter to remove the fundamental frequency of the stimulus signal from the output of the DUT. The remaining signal was measured as an AC voltage, and thus allowed for the manual calculation of total noise and distortion to approximately 0.1% minimum. Subsequent products from HP, Wandell & Goltermann, Radford, Marconi, Sound Technology, and Amber continued to refine measurement capabilities from the 1950s through the 1970s, but the model of usage remained relatively constant; signal generators and analyzers were separate pieces of equipment, and testing involved careful tuning of each one by a person with high technical skills. This changed in 1980 with the introduction of the Tektronix AA501 Distortion Analyzer, which automated the processes of setting levels, frequency tuning and nulling. At this same time Hewlett-Packard introduced the popular HP8903B, which combined a high quality signal generator and analyzer in a single unit. By the mid-eighties, Tektronix ceased production of audio test equipment, and in 1984 members of the team that had developed the AA501 started Audio Precision. The first Audio Precision product was the System One, which combined an integrated generator and analyzer with a connected PC to fully automate test procedures and provide a much higher degree of computational power than the simple microprocessors used in other products at the time. The novel use of a PC allowed for a high degree of custom automation and enabled a radically different visual presentation of results. The combination of PC technology with audio analyzers was adopted by others, including Prism Sound (dScope), Rohde and Schwarz (UPL), and Stanford Research (SR1). As the power of available PCs increased, measurements themselves migrated from being performed internally by audio analyzers to applications running on connected PCs performing FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) calculations, greatly increasing the flexibility and resolution of many results. In addition to analog, audio analyzers today are frequently capable of generating and measuring audio signals over several different types of digital I/O. For example, the Rohde and Schwarz UPP offers AES/EBU, S/PDIF, I¬≤S and HDMI options; the Audio Precision APx500 Series analyzers support AES/EBU, S/PDIF, I¬≤S, HDMI, PDM (Pulse Density Modulation), and Bluetooth radio, and are fully DSP based. Block Diagram and Operation A modern audio analyzer consists of: * An audio generator that provides stimulus, both analog and digital, to the DUT. * Audio input stages that receive a response from the DUT, both analog and digital, and convert it to appropriate signals (analog or digital) for analysis * A signal analyzer that filters the response and calculates results of measurements, commonly a connected or embedded PC in modern solutions * A form of output to the user (display, report, etc.) In a closed-loop test, the analysis engine controls the audio generator while simultaneously measuring the output of the DUT, as shown below: Block Diagram of closed-loop testing with an audio analyzer The signal analyzer can provide control to both the audio generator and the audio input stages, assuring that test conditions are met. This also permits precise time relationships between the stimulus and response of a DUT to be determined. Block Diagram of open-loop testing with an audio analyzer In an open-loop test, the signal analyzer has no control over the audio source driving the DUT, and thus the user must take care to ensure that the source is providing a signal of appropriate characteristics. Open loop tests are useful for measuring DUTs that have no direct signal input, such as a CD or MP3 player. Electro-acoustic Devices Electro-acoustic devices such as loudspeakers and microphones present special problems for analysis, as they must receive or transmit signals through air. In these cases, the DUT in the model shown above must be replaced with the complete electro-mechanical system, e.g., a power amplifier to drive a loudspeaker, a loudspeaker, a measurement microphone and microphone pre-amplifier. The actual device under test can be measured only when the other devices in this system are fully characterized, so that the contributions from these devices may be subtracted from the response. Many modern audio analyzers contain measurement sequences that automate this procedure, and the focus of recent developments has been on quasi-anechoic measurements. These techniques allow loudspeakers to be characterised in a non-ideal (noisy) environment, without the need for an anechoic chamber, which makes them ideally suited for use in high volume production line manufacturing. Most quasi-anechoic measurements are based around an impulse response created from a sine wave whose frequency is swept on a logarithmic scale, with a window function applied to remove any acoustic reflections. The log swept sine method increases signal-to-noise ratio and also allows measurement of individual distortion harmonics up to the Nyquist frequency, something which previously impossible with older analysis techniques such as MLS (Maximum Length Sequence). Audio Generator An audio generator suitable for use in test and measurement must meet several criteria that apply to both analog and digital stimulus: * Ability to generate different waveform types ** Sine ** Square ** Multitone (a group of simultaneous sine waves) ** Sweep (move continuously from one specified frequency to another) ** Standard Inter-modulation waveforms (SMPTE, DIN, DFD, and DIM) ** Arbitrary waveforms * Extremely low residual distortion and noise * Sufficient range of amplitude * Sufficient range of frequency * Extremely high accuracy of amplitude * Extremely high accuracy of frequency * Adjustable and accurate source impedance * Balanced/unbalanced output options (analog) * AC and DC coupling Additionally, the generator will allow for the definition of a precise frequency range and amplitude of the stimulus presented to the DUT. This is critical when aligning test conditions to the characteristics of the DUT. Signal Analyzer Prior to the introduction of integrated audio analyzers, audio generators and audio analyzers were separate pieces of equipment. In this article, signal analyzer refers to the element of a modern audio analyzer that implements the actual measurements. Whether realized in analog circuits, digital signal processing (DSP) or FFT, the analyzer engine must provide high precision implementations of: * AC/DC voltmeter (peak and RMS) * High pass, low pass and weighting filters * Band pass and notch filters * Frequency counter As most modern instruments are digitally based, signal analysis is frequently performed using FFT-based calculations, allowing many results to be calculated in a single test pass. Results of these measurements are processed by the analyzer into readable data using a variety of standard units and formats, such as volts, dB, dBu, SPL, ohms, relative percentage, etc., depending upon the specific measurement being reported. Derived results are achieved by combining several primary results into a calculated result. Measurements and Results Audio analyzers are capable of measuring many types of parameters. The fundamental measurements are: * Level and gain: Level describes the magnitude of a signal, and may be expressed in absolute or relative terms. Common absolute units may be volts, watts, dBV and dBu, while relative measurements are expressed most commonly in dB. Level may also be conditioned as a peak measurement or an RMS measurement. Gain is the ratio of signal level at a DUT's output divided by the signal level at the input, usually expressed in dB. * Frequency response: measures the output level of a DUT as a function of frequency. Level is expressed in the same units as above, typically dBV and dBu. * Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (THD+N): Harmonic distortion products are multiples of stimulus frequencies, while noise is energy that is mathematically unrelated to the input signal. As a signal result, THD+N can be considered all signal content in the DUT response that is not contained in the stimulus. * Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): the ratio of desired signal to unwanted noise coming from a DUT, expressed in dB. * Crosstalk: the unwanted presence of a signal from one audio channel as it appears in other audio channels of a DUT. Since this is a ratio, it is expressed in dB. * Phase: the relationship in time between two signals of identical frequency, expressed as a fraction of the period of the signal. This is usually expressed in degrees, with one complete cycle of a sinusoidal signal being 360 degrees. * Intermodulation Distortion (IMD): Distortion that is the result of non-linear mixing of two or more signals, typically two sine- waves at different frequencies or the sum of a sine-wave and square-wave. In addition to distortion products at harmonic multiples of the frequencies, products are also found at multiples of the sums and differences of the original frequencies. * Time domain display: Equivalent to an oscilloscope display of the signal, showing instantaneous amplitude as a function of time.

It was a sound like I'd never heard before.\\"Kuna (1990), p. 165 \\"Byl jsem v Dachau-Kauferingu koncem roku 1944,\\" vzpom√≠nal Norbert Fr√Ωd, \\"kdy≈æ se rozezp√≠vali kluci z cel√© Evropy ‚Äì Francouzi, Holanƒèan√©, Nƒõmci, Pol√°ci, Jugosl√°vci, ≈òekov√©, my ƒåe≈°i a j√° nev√≠m kdo je≈°tƒõ ‚Äì ka≈æd√Ω jsme zp√≠vali \\"Internacion√°lu\\" ve vlastn√≠ mate≈ô≈°tinƒõ, a p≈ôece dohromady. Znƒõlo mi to jako nikdy p≈ôedt√≠m.\\" In April 1945, as the SS were starting to evacuate the camps, he managed to escape. Fr√Ωd's father, brother and wife died in the concentration camps and he appears to have been the only member of his family to survive the Holocaust. During the immediate postwar period, he helped the Americans as an interpreter during the interrogation of the Dachau SS guards. He returned to Prague on 22 May 1945, together with his friend Karel Reiner.Kuna (2008), p. 165 After the war, he worked as a journalist and an official of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. In 1946, he changed his name to Fr√Ωd. A year later, in 1947, he became a cultural diplomatic attach√© in Mexico and subsequently served in various diplomatic posts in Latin America and the U.S. After a brief period of employment with Czechoslovak Radio from 1951‚Äì1953, he embarked on a career as a freelance writer. His childhood friend, the writer Lenka Reinerov√°, recalled in an interview how he had helped her when she was arrested in 1952. She remembered him as being \\"the only person who protested against my arrest by the communist authorities.After the war, Reinerov√° spent 15 months in a communist prison. You know, I remembered him as a cheerful guy who was always playing the guitar and singing. Then he was taken in a transport to the camps. He came back from Dachau, but he was a different person. No guitar, no singing. When I gave him my hand, I realized the terrible change. He had cold moist hands, as if you were touching a corpse. He suffered from depression and anxiety. He had to cope with terrible fear. And yet he wasn't scared and went to the communist Department of the Interior on my behalf\\", she said. \\"Jedin√Ω ƒçlovƒõk se odv√°≈æil protestovat, ≈°el dokonce a≈æ na ministerstvo vnitra a sna≈æil se je tam p≈ôesvƒõdƒçit, ≈æe jsem nic neprovedla, ale nic nezmohl.

Ale vid√≠te ‚Äì jedin√Ω se neb√°l a ≈°el kv≈Øli mnƒõ a≈æ na vnitro!\\" From 1951 until the early 1970s, he served as a delegate to UNESCO. Fr√Ωd died in Prague in 1976.  Style  Fr√Ωd published his first literary efforts in 1929 in the magazine Tramp. He wrote in both Czech and German. The main theme of his works was the fate of Czech Jews. In the novel Krabice ≈æiv√Ωch, he attempted to provide a detailed psychological picture of concentration camp prisoners and their SS guards. He also produced short stories, news reports and travel books. During his career, he worked for the theatre, radio and television. Children's literature was another important part of his work. As well as children's books he also wrote scripts for children's films. He illustrated his books with photographs taken during his extensive travels.  Krabice ≈æiv√Ωch (A Box of Lives)  Fr√Ωd completed his most successful novel in 1956. The plot is set in the last months of 1944, in the fictional concentration camp of Gigling. The main character, the young intellectual Zdenƒõk Roub√≠k, is an assistant in the camp office. One of his jobs is to maintain the card index of the inmates, hence the title of the novel, \\"A Box of Lives\\". In the camp, Roub√≠k gradually manages to overcome the apathy and depression caused by the death of his brother and he becomes more actively involved in camp life. The author attempts to depict everyday life, social interactions and relationships in the camp, and the work and hardships of the inmates. The description of the SS guards in the camp is a focus of particular attention. The novel includes autobiographical elements (like Roub√≠k's brother in the novel, the author's brother Jan died in a concentration camp) and attempts to document life in the inhumane environment of a concentration camp. It offers philosophical insights while attempting to provide an objective picture of the camp's everyday reality. The author reflects on how to maintain human dignity and cope with evil in the extraordinary circumstances of the camp. The novel was acclaimed by contemporary critics, and republished in numerous editions and translations.

It is located at 555-600 Michigan Avenue in Saline, Michigan, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History In 1845, David Schuyler Haywood constructed a gristmill at this site on the western edge of Saline, Michigan. A small settlement, Barnegat, soon coalesced around the mill site; Barnegat was annexed by the village of Saline in 1848. However, by 1865, business declined, and the mill was soon closed. Henry Ford purchased the site in 1936, refurbished it, and opened it as a soybean processing plant in 1938. The site employed up to 19 people, who removed the soybean oil from the beans, which was processed into plastics and paint. The residuals were used to make casting cores or for cattle feed. In 1943, Ford moved a one-room Greek Revival schoolhouse to the site and refurbished it as a residence. However, the plant was closed in 1947, not long after Henry Ford's death. After its closure, the building was used by a private soybean processing firm. However, the processing equipment was soon obsolete, and in 1962, the property was turned into an antique shop and general store, know first as the \\"Sauk Trail Inn\\". and later as \\"Weller's Country Store.\\" More recently, part of the structure has been used as a cafe and a banquet facility. Description The Schuyler Mill/Ford Soybean Plant Complex sits on 11-1/2 acres in a park-like setting. It consists primarily of the original 1845 mill and the ancillary fieldstone-lined millrace. The mill is a three- story timber-framed gable-roofed Greek Revival building covered with clapboard. A smaller two-story wing sits to one side; it is flanked by two single-story wings. Across the street sits a modern residence built around the old schoolhouse. In addition, Ford built four more structures: a Greek Revival-style extractor plant and a pump house near the mill, and two storage buildings near the mill. In addition, Ford constructed a dam and spillway at the mill pond.

Using his new assets, Cole and partner Kramer began Star Publications. The company's first title was Blue Bolt, which continued the numbering of the Novelty Press title (starting with issue #102). By 1951, inspired by the popularity of horror comics like EC Comics' Tales from the Crypt, Cole shifted the Blue Bolt comic to horror, renaming it Blue Bolt Weird Tales of Terror. (The title was eventually changed again, to Ghostly Weird Stories, lasting five more issues before being canceled.) Other notable titles published by Star included All-Famous Police Cases, Frisky Animals, Shocking Mystery Cases, and the romance titles Popular Teen-Agers, Top Love Stories, and True-To-Life Romances. The company also published a line of coloring books in comic book format (mostly with titles like The Star Coloring Book of...), consisting of full-page drawings with no word balloons and no narrative. Due to the grisly nature of titles like Blue Bolt Weird Tales of Terror, The Horrors, and Startling Terror Tales, Star Publications was singled out in Fredric Wertham's 1954 book Seduction of the Innocent.

It was situated near Comet in The Hollow section of Hersheypark from 1974 through 1975. It was relocated to Kissing Tower Hill in 1976, where it remained in operation until its removal at the end of the 1978 season. The ride was purchased used at a public sale; it was constructed by B.A. Schiff & Associates, some time before 1974. The coaster featured an oval track with a series of small hills. It completed the circuit five times before the ride cycle ended.  Ride history  Picture of the front of the train of Mini- Comet. The front of the train is the only way to distinguish the manufacturer of the train. This style train was manufactured by B.A. Schiff & Associates. The Mini-Comet was an oval shaped kiddie coaster. The trains were painted blue, while the track was painted red. It operated in two locations in Hersheypark; near the Comet in The Hollow and in Kissing Tower Hill next to the OutBoard MotorBoats, Whip and then Himalaya. It operated in The Hollow in 1974 and 1975, then in Kissing Tower Hill from 1976 until its removal after the 1978 season.  Confusion surrounding ride  Charles J. Jacques wrote in his book Sweetness of Success that it was an Allen Herschel built ride. It was also believed to be a Miler Manufacturer based on images of the coaster from 1978. However, based on film of the ride from 1977, it was shown to be a B.A. Schiff & Associates kiddie ride. The name of the ride was also thought to be Little Comet, but all park documentation mentioning the ride say Mini- Comet.  Ride experience  The ride begins with riders being pulled up the 15 foot chain lift hill. At the top of the hill, the track curves and goes down an eight foot drop. It curves around the oval track, going through a series of short hills. It curves around again as it approaches the station. The ride cycled four additional times before coming to a stop.

Biography Thomson was born in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, England, to John Thomson, a carpenter, joiner and builder, and Jane (n√©√© McWilliam). His mother died when he was very young, and the family moved to Melbourne, where he attended Essendon Primary School until the age of 14. He was apprenticed to his father in the carpentry trade before working in several Victorian towns. In 1895, Thomson came to Western Australia, working as a journeyman at Fremantle before establishing a business there. On 4 April 1896, he married Edith Maud Jenkinson, with whom he was to have four sons. He worked at Buckland Hill and served as a councillor on the Buckland Hill Road Board from 1903 until 1905, before moving to the town of Katanning where he opened a timber and hardware store known as Thomson and Melany. In 1911, he was elected to the Katanning Road Board and served as its chairman in 1913. At the 1914 state election, Thomson was elected under the Liberal Party banner to the seat of Katanning. He switched to the Country Party in 1917. Thomson became the Country Party's deputy leader in 1921. In 1923, the party split between the majority of the party's parliamentary wing, who favoured coalition with the Nationalist Party, and the party executive who favoured a more independent line. Thomson led the three-member Executive Country Party to the 1924 election, where most of the Majority faction lost their seats. Thomson became leader of a reunited Country Party and led it until being defeated in his own seat by Arnold Piesse, an unendorsed Country Party candidate, at the 1930 election. He stood for and won a by-election for one of the South-East Province seats in the Western Australian Legislative Council on 26 September 1931 following the death of Hector Stewart, which he retained until his retirement at the 1950 Legislative Council election, at which his son, Jack Thomson, succeeded him. Jack went on to hold the seat for 24 years. Over the intervening years, Alec Thomson had been director of the Katanning Flour Mill, founder of the Katanning Fresh Air League and the Historical Society, and was active in local affairs, including serving as president of the Katanning Bowling Club and the Katanning Club. He was also active in the Freemasons. Thomson died at home on 18 November 1953, aged 80, and was cremated at Karrakatta Cemetery.

Cinemagraphs are still photographs in which a minor and repeated movement occurs, forming a video clip. They are published as an animated GIF or in other video formats, and can give the illusion that the viewer is watching an animation. A variation is a video snapshot (clip composed like a still photo, but instead of a shutter release it is captured using the video recording function with its audio track and perhaps showing minor movement such as the subject's eye blinks). Another variation is an audio snapshot (still photo linked to an audio file created at the moment of photo capture by certain cameras that offer this proprietary function). Cinemagraphs are made by taking a series of photographs or a video recording, and, using image editing software, compositing the photographs or the video frames into a seamless loop of sequential frames. This is done in such a way that motion in part of the subject between exposures (for example, a person's dangling leg) is perceived as a repeating or continued motion, in contrast with the stillness of the rest of the image. The term \\"cinemagraph\\" was coined by U.S. photographers Kevin Burg and Jamie Beck, who used the technique to animate their fashion and news photographs beginning in early 2011.

Nechtman (2010): Nabobs: Empire and Identity in Eighteenth-Century Britain, p. 13 in early British India. Barwell was the son of William Barwell, governor of Bengal in 1748, and afterwards a director of the East India Company and Sheriff of Surrey in 1768. His family, which apparently came from Kegworth, Leicestershire, had been connected with the East for generations. Biography Barwell was born in Calcutta in 1741 and appointed a writer on the Bengal establishment of the East India Company in 1756 and landed at Calcutta on 21 June 1758. After a succession of lucrative appointments, he was nominated in the Regulating Act (13 Geo. III, c. 63) a member of council in Bengal, with Philip Francis as one of his colleagues, General John Clavering as commander-in-chief, and Warren Hastings as governor-general. The statute is dated 1772‚Äì3, but the members of council did not take their seats until 20 October 1774. In 1776 he married a Miss Sanderson, the reigning beauty of Calcutta; but she died in November 1778, leaving one son. A portrait of Barwell, seated in his library with this son by his side, was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and engraved in mezzotint by William Dickenson. Barwell is known to history for his constant support of Hastings, in opposition to the party led by Francis. Hastings wrote of him, \\"He possesses much experience, a solid judgment, much greater fertility of resources than I have, and his manners are easy and pleasant.\\" Francis differed, writing, \\"He is rapacious without industry, and ambitious without an exertion of his faculties or steady application to affairs. He will do whatever can be done by bribery and intrigue; he has no other resource.\\" Barwell has been cited for sharp business practices. Writing in the Cambridge History of India, H.H. Dodwell says: : He made a great fortune in India, and, as Sir James Stephen says, this fact of itself raises a presumption against his official purity. ... his standard was low. We find him writing to his sister in 1769: \\"I would spend 5,000 to secure to myself the chiefship of Dacca, and to supervise. the collection of the revenues of that province\\". In another letter he states that he considers himself justified in evading the law which prohibited the Company's servants from trading, by engaging in salt contracts under the names of native Indians.Dodwell, Henry; The Cambridge History of India: v.5 : British India, 1497-1858, The University Press, 1858; p. 226 A scandalous story about him is found in a rare book entitled The Intrigues of a Nabob; or Bengal the fittest Soil for the Growth of Lust, Injustice, and DishonestyH. F. Thompson. 1780 It alleges that Barwell had enticed away the writer's mistress, who passed at Calcutta for his wife and then discontinued an annuity promised to the writer as the price of his acquiescence. While member of council he was accused of deriving an illicit profit of 20,000 a year from certain salt contracts. His prosecution was ordered by the court of directors, but the proceedings fell through. In connection with this affair he fought a bloodless duel with General Clavering. Francis and Barwell were antagonists at the whist-table, where Francis is said to have won 20,000 at a sitting. In 1780, after a truce between Hastings and Francis, Barwell retired from the service. From India he allegedly brought back one of the largest fortunes ever accumulated. The phrase \\"Fetch more curricles\\" is associated with him. In 1781 he bought the estate of Stanstead in Sussex from the trustees of the Earl of Halifax for 102,500 and subsequently added to his possessions in that county. He 'enlarged and remodelled [Stanstead House] in a style of expense which contributed to exhaust the oriental treasures by which it was supplied.' As architects, Bonomi and James Wyatt were employed on the work for five years, while Capability Brown laid out the grounds. In 1781 Barwell was returned as tory M.P. for Helston, in 1784 for St Ives, and in 1790 and 1796 for Winchelsea. On 24 June 1785 he also married his second wife Catherine Coffin (1769-1847), the daughter of Elizabeth and Nathaniel Coffin, a customs official from Boston, Massachusetts.http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1536282;jsessionid=73E5C0D620815DE4F821C19F03A3EEB4?lang=eng He also had three girls and a boy by his mistress 'Mrs Seaforth' (the assumed name of Rebecca Lyne)David Mannings, Sir Joshua Reynolds: a complete catalogue of his paintings, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2000, p. 568, no. 2171 and p. 408 no. 1595Luisa Cal√®, Fuseli's Milton gallery, Oxford 2006, p. 72https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp123914/mrs-seaforth In December 1796 he resigned from his parliamentary seat.

Life Baskerville, son of Thomas Baskerville, (apothecary and sometimes one of the stewards of Exeter, who was descended from the ancient family of the Baskervilles in Herefordshire), was baptised at the church of St. Mary Major, Exeter, on 27 October 1574. After receiving a suitable preliminary education, he was sent to Oxford, was taught under Dr Thomas Holland, and matriculated on 10 March 1591 as a member of Exeter College, where he was placed under the care of William Helm, a man famous for his piety and learning. On the first vacancy, he was elected a fellow of the college before he had graduated B.A., and he did not take that degree until 8 July 1596. Subsequently, he proceeded M.A. On the occasion of King James I's visit to the university, Baskerville was \\"chosen as a prime person to dispute before him in the philosophic art, which he performed with great applause of his majesty, who was not only there as a hearer, but as an accurate judge\\". Turning his attention to the study of physic, he graduated M.B. on 20 June 1611 and was afterward created doctor in that faculty. He seems to have practiced at Oxford for some years with considerable success. Then he removed to London, where he was admitted a candidate in the College of Physicians on 18 April 1614 and a fellow on 20 March 1614‚Äì15. He was censor of the college in 1615 and several subsequent years, anatomy reader in 1626, and consiliarius in 1640. He attained to great eminence in his profession and was appointed physician to James I and afterwards to Charles I, who conferred on him the honour of knighthood 30 August 1636.as Dr. Baldwin Hamey wrote: \\"Rex autem in Bibliotheca Oxoniensi, tanquam in acie sui generis instructissima eundem in Equestrem cooptavit\\". It is related that he had no fewer than a hundred patients a week, and that he amassed so much wealth as to acquire the title of \\"Sir Simon Baskerville the rich\\". Further it is recorded of him \\"that he was a great friend to the clergy and the inferior loyal gentry\\", insomuch that \\"he never took a fee of an orthodox minister under a dean, nor of any suffering cavalier in the cause of Charles I under a gentleman of an hundred a year, but with physick to their bodies generally gave relief to their necessities\\". He died on 5 July 1641 and was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral, where a mural monument, with a Latin epitaph, was erected to his memory.

Life Bate was, according to Leland's account, born west of the River Severn (inter Transabrinos), but seems to have been brought up in the Carmelite monastery at York, where his progress in learning was so great that he was dispatched to complete his studies at Oxford. Philosophy and theology seem to have divided his attention, and on asking his master's degree in both these subjects he proceeded to add to his reputation by authorship. He was acknowledged to be an authority in his own university and the news of his acquirements soon spread abroad. His name became known to the heads of his order and at last his fellow Carmelites of York elected him their prior. It was probably somewhat earlier than this that he was ordained sub-deacon and deacon in March and May 1415 by Clifford, Bishop of London. Bate appears to have continued in his new office until February 1429, when he died ‚Äòweighed down by a violent disease.‚Äô According to John Bale, Thomas Netter of Walden spoke of him with praise. When Bate died he was buried at York, where his tomb seems to have been extant in the days of Bale, who quotes one verse from the Latin epitaph inscribed upon it: Bati doctoris h√¶c condit petra cadaver. Works The main works of Bate whose titles have survived are treatises on the ‚ÄòParts of Speech,‚Äô on Porphyry's ‚ÄòUniversals,‚Äô and on Aristotle's ‚ÄòEthics.‚Äô Other works were on Aristotle, and on Gilbert de la Por√©e's Sex Pr√¶dicamenta.‚Äô Bate was a Greek scholar; but Bale claimed that Bate devoted his talents to propping up the blasphemies of the Antichrist and disseminating evil dogmas.
