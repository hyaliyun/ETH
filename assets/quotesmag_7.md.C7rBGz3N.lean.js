The park, or open common, was once of 14 hectares but was mostly built over in the 19th century, beginning in the 1830s, and is now a small park, popular with office workers at lunchtime, and as a children's playground. A large surrounding area was once called by the name, but this is now less common. In the 18th century it was a disreputable area, known for \\"the rude sports that were in vogue, such as duck-hunting, prize-fighting, bull-baiting, and others of an equally demoralising character\\", and \\"seems to have been much infected by sneaking footpads, who knocked down pedestrians passing to and from London, and despoiled them of hats, wigs, silver buckles, and money\\",Islington Tribune, quoting Old and New London: Volume 2, a history of the area written in 1878 The moral tone gradually improved after the Spa Fields Chapel was erected in 1777 by the Countess of Huntingdon, a famous Evangelical. Owenite community The community was established in a number of properties at Guildford Street East, Bagnigge Wells Road and Spa Fields, London. The community was based on the cooperative ideas of Robert Owen and was the idea of George Mudie (b. 1788). On 23 January 1821, a group of printers met at Mitchell's Assembly Rooms, London, to discuss Mudie's proposals for a community, and at this meeting a committee was appointed. They met at the Medallic Cabinet, 158 The Strand, to raise money. As part of the fund-raising effort, Mudie began publication of a weekly journal, the Economist, which ran from 27 January 1821 to 9 March 1822. The plan was soon formulated to create a \\"Co-operative and Economical Society\\" of 200 families. The male members had to contribute a guinea to the central fund. There would be a communal kitchen and dining hall, plus there were plans for a school as well. The committee calculated that the community would save around £8,000 per year through its own manufacture of various items that it would use. Mudie believed that the community would be able to become independent. During this period the chairman was George Hinde and one prominent member was the printer Henry Hetherington. By December 1821, the \\"Spa Fields Congregational families\\" had begun to live together. The women worked from 6am to 8pm, and the children were also kept busy \\"without a moment's intermission\\". The community advertised various services that they would provide, such as cobbling, painting, haberdashery, etc., and they also announced that they would be opening a school run on approved Fellenbergian lines. The community also set up a \\"monitor\\" system whereby each monitor looked after one person and acted as his \\"confessor\\". Mudie found himself working very hard to maintain the community, but this affected the quality of the Economist. The publication ceased in March 1822 and the community continued for another two years. The reasons for its demise are not known, but Mudie immersed himself in another community, at Orbiston, run by Abram Combe, but could not agree with Combe and also left this community after a year or so.

In the absence of literary works describing this little-known village, indications of its medieval character can be found in various travel articles and guides, such as the Penne Tourism and Holiday Guide which states: > The village extends along the rocky outcrop under the protection of its > medieval castle ... The village has retained its authenticity, its narrow > streets lined with timbered houses and wooden corbels, ancient grain > measures, its Androne, its mullioned windows and doors. The mountainous and hilly terrain, coupled with poor soil, make for a local economy that is precarious. Younger generations continually move away from the area, to make a better living in Paris and other major cities.Barraclough, C 2004, 'Where the local patois has no word for stress: A world away from urban bustle, Colin Barraclough explores the 'real' France of Quercy Blanc', Financial Times, 14 Aug. 2004, p. 17. Academic OneFile, accessed 3 July 2018,. In the 21st century, the industry of tourism in the Tarn region appears to have stemmed the decline in the Penne population to some extent, as statistics show a small increase over ten years: from 552 inhabitants in 2007 to 576 in 2017.Brinkhoff, T 2018, ‘The population development of the communes in Albi’, City Population, accessed 5 Jul 2018, .  Bronze Age site  Muséum de Toulouse The first archaeological finds indicating human activity in the Languedoc region date back to the Holocene Bronze Age, 1800-1500 BC, according to Bilotte, Duranthon and Palevol. In 2006 these writers revived interest in the work of the scientist, Jean-Baptiste Noulet (1802-1890), who had explored the Tarn area in the mid-19th century and found evidence of human habitation in many of the caves there. Working in Penne in 1851, within a cave known as 'Le Cuzoul d'Armand' or 'Grotte Mazuc', Noulet found several prehistoric artifacts, including a bronze and pearl necklace, now held in the Noulet Collection at the Toulouse Museum.'Collier de perles en bronze de Penne', Ressources Éducatives Libres, accessed 5 Jul 2018, .  Medieval fortified village  The ruins of the Castle of Penne According to the historical account on the Southwest Story web site, \\"The first reference to a castle in the village of Penne dates from 825 AD and its first known señor was Geoffroi, mentioned in 1096 in documents related to Raymond, Count of Toulouse\\" . Throughout the Middle Ages (5th to 15th centuries) the site of Penne was of military strategic importance, being situated on the borders of the provinces of Albigeois, Quercy and Rouergue, with its fortress perched atop a cliff overlooking the River Aveyron. As such, it was frequently the target of attack, most notably during the Albigensian Crusade - a twenty-year military campaign (1209-1229) initiated by the French king, Phillip II and the Roman Catholic pope, Innocent III.Lambert, MD, The Cathars, EasternCell.com, accessed 03 July 2018, . Ostensibly, the objective of the crusade was the elimination of all Cathars in southern France, but this coincided with the French king's political ambition to annex the area to his northern territory.'Phillip II: King of France', Encyclopedia Britannica, accessed 3 July 2018, . People who adhered to Catharic principles were held to be anti- Catholic heretics and, as narrated by McCaffrey, \\"their treatment was savage and merciless - heretics and their sympathisers were often either slaughtered or burned alive at the stake\\".McCaffrey, E 2002, 'Imaging the Cathars in Late- Twentieth-Century Languedoc', Contemporary European History, Cambridge University Press, Vol. 11, No. 3, pp. 409-427, accessed 3 Jul 2018., The castle remained in use, seeing repeated conflicts, such as the Hundred Years War(1337-1453) between England and France, and the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598) between Protestants and Roman Catholics during which it was partly destroyed. It was then abandoned for approximately 400 years.'History of Chateau Penne', Fortresse de Penne, accessed 4 Jul 2018, . Interest in the village's architecture and history was re-ignited in 1902 when the castle was officially declared to be a Historic Monument of France, after which restoration of the ruins began, and the work is still ongoing. The remains of the castle include the dungeon, the ramparts and a chapel. Penne castle is open to the public from mid-February until mid-November each year, with educational events and pageants being performed in July and August.  13th Century church - St Catherine de Penne  The church of Sainte Catherine de Penne The city council provides information about the church of St Catherine of Penne,'Historique et Caracteristiques Des Six Eglises de Penne', Internet Site of the Commune of Penne, accessed 6 Jul 2018, which includes the following points of interest: The church has undergone numerous changes over the centuries. It was originally built around the end of the 13th century, in the Occitan Gothic style; several 13th century features remain, such as the holy water stoup. It formed part of the defensive system of town walls and was at the entrance to the village. During the Wars of Religion in the 16th century, the building was badly damaged, and the church bells were thrown into a well (but they were later retrieved and one was able to be restored). Interior of Sainte Catherine de Penne It was re-roofed and restored during the reign of Henry IV ('Good King Henry') (1589-1610). Each century since has seen intermittent efforts to restore and improve the church, including a major re- orientation of the building in 1876. The tabernacle in the choir is of painted and gilded wood, and was registered as a \\"Monument Historique\\" on 6 June 1993  13th century legend - Adalaïs and Raymond  There is a legend that in the early 13th century the Castle of Penne was owned by the noblewoman Adalaïs - a great beauty, famous for cultivation of the chivalric arts and for commissioning brilliant pageants and festivals. Adalaïs was courted by the head of the powerful House of Toulouse, Raymond Jourdain.'Amour malheureux d’Adalaïs et du chevalier Raymond au château de Penne (Tarn)', France Pittoresque, accessed 5 Jul 2018, . Troubadour entertaining a royal audience Count Raymond Jourdain, a highly accomplished knight in the chivalric tradition, is said to have pledged himself to Adalaïs, before being called away to war. When she was told that he had been killed in battle, her grief was such that she renounced her noble life, and made the irreversible decision to enter a monastery. However, against all expectations, Raymond Jourdain recovered from his battle wounds and returned to Penne, where he found that Adalaïs was effectively lost to him. After an extended period of mourning he found a replacement for Adalaïs, in the person of Elise (or Alice) de Montfort, as the fable tells it. An alternative version of the legend is related by Rutherford,Rutherford, J 1873, The troubadors their loves and lyrics, Smith and Elder, London, p. 153. who records that Raymond Jourdain was involved with Madame Mabine Rais, the wife of the Viscount of Albi, not Adalaïs of Penne, and that Mabine died of grief at his reported death, rather than entering a monastery. Another version of the story, also told by Rutherford, names Raymond of Miraval - a famous troubadour, and a favourite of Raymond Jourdain - as the ardent suitor of one Adalaïs, the wife of Bernard of Boisasso, the lord of the Castle of Lombes. Their story is filled with intrigue and deceit, and ended when Adalaïs tricked Raymond by consorting with the King of Saxony instead of spending the night with Raymond.Rutherford, J 1873, The troubadors their loves and lyrics, Smith and Elder, London, pp. 270-276. Works by Raymond of Miraval still exist‘Raimon de Miravalh: Complete Works’, Trobador.org, accessed 7 Jul 2018, and include two songs which link the names of Adalaïs and Raymond.

After World War II, on 4 September 1947, the colony was revived as a part of the French Union, with its previous boundaries. On 11 December 1958, it was reconstituted as the self-governing Republic of Upper Volta within the French Community, and two years later on 5 August 1960, it attained full independence. On 4 August 1984, the name was changed to Burkina Faso. The name Upper Volta indicates that the country contains the upper part of the Volta River. The river is divided into three parts, called the Black Volta, White Volta and Red Volta.  History  Until the end of the 19th century, the history of Upper Volta was dominated by the empire-building Mossi/Mossi Kingdoms, who are believed to have come up to their present location from present-day Northern Ghana. For centuries, the Mossi peasant was both farmer and soldier, and the Mossi people were able to defend their religious beliefs and social structure against forcible attempts to convert them to Islam by Muslims from the northwest. When the French arrived and claimed the area in 1896, Mossi resistance ended with the capture of their capital at Ouagadougou. In 1919, certain provinces from Upper Senegal and Niger were united into a separate colony called the Upper Volta in the French West Africa federation. In 1932, the new colony was dismembered in a move to economise ; it was reconstituted in 1937 as an administrative division called the Upper Coast. After World War II, the Mossi renewed their pressure for separate territorial status and on 4 September 1947, Upper Volta became a French West African territory again in its own right. A revision in the organisation of French overseas territories began with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganisational measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 that ensured a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958. Upper Volta achieved independence on 5 August 1960. The first president, Maurice Yaméogo, was the leader of the Voltaic Democratic Union (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by universal suffrage of a president and a national assembly for five year terms; however, soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV.

He is the Curator of Exhibitions at the National Yiddish Book Center and owns R. Michelson Galleries in Northampton, Massachusetts.  Personal life  Born in Brooklyn, New York, Michelson was the son of a shopkeeper, Maurice, and homemaker, Caroline (Kay). Michelson experienced personal tragedy early in life when his father was killed during a robbery. The horrors of the holocaust also figured strongly; Michelson's aunt, recalling her years as a young Jew living in Europe, is haunted by memories of Hitler's Gestapo. While his poetry for adults—published in the collections Tap Dancing for the Relatives and Battles and Lullabies—reflects the serious nature of his reflections on history, racism, and culture, his work for younger readers is inspired by his love of, and respect for family and culture. In 1972, when Michelson was only 19, he set off on a tour of the mid- west, selling fine-art reproductions for three years and subsequently becoming devoted to art and literature. It was during this time that Michelson met his wife to-date, Jennifer Michelson, currently an Interfaith Minister. Michelson's wife, Jennifer, and he have two children, Marisa and Samuel. Marisa is a composer and playwright. Samuel is the Director of Operations at a high end architectural hardware company called Nanz. Their hobbies include theater and biking.

In 1976, Michelson was able to open his first art gallery which he ran for three years before moving back to the east coast and opening the R. Michelson Galleries, a 4-story monumental old bank building with 60 ft. ceilings and marble floors located in Northampton MA, which Michelson continues to run to this day. It exhibits the works of numerous contemporary sculptors, painters, and printmakers. His gallery showcases well known artists such as Leonard Baskin (sculptor and printmaker), Leonard Nimoy (photographer, actor), Randall Deihl (painter), Thomas Locker (landscape artist) and more than 50 additional artists.

Themes & Influences  In picture books such as Grandpa's Gamble, Too Young for Yiddish, and Happy Feet Michelson depicts close-knit family relationships. Reflecting his own Jewish traditions, Grandpa's Gamble finds a young boy trying to understand why his elderly grandfather spends so much time in prayerful silence. When the boy's question is answered by Grandpa Sam, the boy learns about the persecution of Jews in Poland many years before, and about how his immigrant grandfather had used the opportunities available in America to become a wealthy man before the illness of a child humbled him and caused him to return to his faith. Too Young for Yiddish again finds a boy turning to his grandfather, or Zayde, for guidance, this time with the hope of learning Yiddish. Although the man dismisses the child's request due to the boy's youth, his collection of books create a connection between the two generations as time passes. In Booklist Hazel Rochman deemed Grandpa's Gamble a \\"moving immigrant Passover story\\" that brings to life \\"the intimate bonds of love and faith across generations,\\" while a Publishers Weekly critic wrote that Too Young for Yiddish \\"possesses both power and pathos\\" and stands as an \\"urgent\\" reminder to readers that the Yiddish language is slowly being lost to time. A Detroit Jewish News critic wrote \\"One of the best Jewish children's books published in recent memory, and one of the top 25 ever published.\\" Although the family is African American, Happy Feet is similar in theme to Michelson's Jewish-themed picture books because it centers on a strong family. Focusing on the parent-child relationship, the story is narrated by a young boy whose father runs a business across the street from Harlem's Savoy ballroom, where the family has a front-row seat to the parade of culture, swing music, dance, and celebrity that passes through the dance palace's doors. Showcasing the rich culture that flowered in that New York neighborhood during the early twentieth century, Happy Feet serves as \\"a valentine to the renowned Savoy\\" as well as a \\"tribute [that] will take young readers back to Harlem-as-it-was,\\" according to a Kirkus Reviews writer. The \\"beautifully lit, expressive watercolor\\" illustrations by Caldecott Medal-winning artist E.B. Lewis add to the book's magic, according to Booklist contributor Carolyn Phelan, and in School Library Journal Nina Lindsay deemed Happy Feet a \\"charming\\" story in which Michelson presents \\"a dramatic read-aloud introduction\\" to the Jazz Era. Across the Alley,is about Abe and Willie, next door neighbors. During the day they don't play together, because Abe is Jewish and Willie is black. But at night, when nobody is watching, they're best friends. The Kirkus Review says “Set during the time of segregation, the story lends hope for a future without racism... A beautiful blend of story and art.\\" This book was runner up for the National Jewish Book Award 2007. As Good As Anybody is also about the friendship between blacks and Jews. In a starred review, Booklist (American Library Association)said “In this powerful, well-crafted story about a partnership between two great civil rights leaders, Michelson shows how the fight for human rights affects everyone... Michelson writes in poetic language that gracefully uses repetitive sentence structures and themes to emphasize the similarities between the two men’s lives. Also admirable is Michelson’s ability to convey complex historical concepts, such as segregation, in clear, potent terms that will speak directly to readers:...an exceptional title for sharing and discussion.

Z. Herrmann), (born Zürich 20 July 1803; died Liverpool 15 June 1865) was a Swiss violinist, conductor and composer.http://opera.stanford.edu/composers/Z.html Childhood Born at Zürich in 1803, Zeugheer learned the violin first from Heinrich Joseph Wassermann in his native town, and in 1818 was placed at Munich under Ferdinand Fränzl, for the violin, and Joseph Graetz for composition and musical science. A visit to Vienna in 1823 confirmed his enthusiasm for chamber-music and Beethoven, who remained through life the object of his highest veneration. Career as a quartet player The example of Schuppanzigh, and of the four brothers Moralt, suggested to Zeugheer the idea of attempting the same with his friends in Munich, as \\"das Quartett Gebrüder Herrmann\\". Zeugheer was leader; Joseph Wex of Immenstadt, second violin; Carl Baader, viola; and Joseph Lidel (grandson of Andreas Lidel, the eminent performer on the baryton), violoncello. They started Aug. 34, 1824, for the south, and gave performances at the towns of south Germany and Switzerland, and along the Rhine to the Netherlands and Belgium. In the spring of 1826 they played in Paris, before Cherubini and Pierre Baillot, and gave a public performance assisted by Henriette Sontag and Alexandre Boucher with his sons. They first performed in Paris Spohr's double quartet in D minor, the second quartet being played by Boucher and his three sons. =In Britain= From Boulogne the quartet crossed the Channel; in England they seem to have been successful, at Dover, Ramsgate, and especially at Brighton, where they resided for five months. They gave concerts throughout the South and West of England, and in Ireland from Cork to Dublin, where they arrived in November 1827. Early in 1828 they proceeded by Belfast to Glasgow, Edinburgh and London. In London they had only a few engagements in private houses; Wex retired ill, and the quartet was broken up till a new violinist was found in Anton Popp of Würzburg. The concerts begun again with a series of six at Liverpool in the summer of 1829, and were continued through the northern counties. But in the spring of 1830 the \\"brothers\\" had had enough of a roving life. Zeugheer and Baader settled at Liverpool, Lidel and Popp at Dublin. Zeugheer resided in Liverpool till his death, Baader till his retirement in 1869. Zeugheer's quartet was only the second ever to perform in England, and were the first to play in England any but the first six of Beethoven's quartets. In many towns they found that no one knew what a quartet was. Career as a conductor In 1831 Zeugheer took the conductorship of the Gentlemen's Concerts at Manchester, which he retained till 1838. The Liverpool Philharmonic Society, originally a private society, began in January 1840 to give public concerts with an orchestra, and in 1843 appointed Zeugheer director. He conducted their concerts from that date until March 28, 1865, shortly before his death, which took place suddenly June 15, 1865. Career as a teacher Zeugheer was highly praised for his work as a teacher in Liverpool. Although not a pianist, he fully understood the art of training the hand. Mr. Chorley, the musical critic of the \\"Athenaeum\\", never had any musical teacher but Zeugheer, whose genius he estimated highly and proclaimed in print. According to Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Zeugheer's playing was very pure in tone and refined in expression, though his position was not favourable to original composition. Compositions He wrote two Symphonies, two Overtures, a Cantata, two sets of Entr'actes, a Violin Concerto op. 28, a Potpourri for violin and orchestra op. 6, an instrumental Quartet, an Andante and Rondo for piano and violin op. 21, and a Polacca fur four voices, few of them published. In Liverpool he wrote an opera Angela of Venice to Chorley's words, but it was neither produced nor published, owing to the badness of the libretto. He published two sets of waltzes, a vocal duet \\"Come, lovely May\\", and other songs and glees.

VakifBank has two international offices located in New York and Bahrain and it also has participation in Austria named VakifBank International AG which has branches in Vienna, Cologne and Frankfurt. VakıfBank was founded on April 13, 1954 under the special law Türkiye Vakıflar Bankası Türk Anonim Ortaklığı Kanunu. VakıfBank’s initial purpose was the management of the cash revenues and expenditures of the charitable foundations set up during the Ottoman Empire period. VakıfBank was established in Ankara and quickly began conducting banking activities with branch offices in Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir. History =1950s to 1980s= In 1956, after conducting extensive studies and surveys in the major economic centers across Turkey, VakıfBank continued its growth by opening an additional 10 branches. In 1957, VakıfBank made its first venture towards broadening its services with the establishment of Güneş Insurance. Over the next 20 years, VakıfBank continued to expand and widen its geographic presence in Turkey by opening new branches throughout Turkey, including in other important commercial and industrial regions. By 1977, VakıfBank had 206 branch offices. =1980s= During the 1980s, VakıfBank sought to keep pace with technological advances and placed special emphasis on improving its operations through investment in technology. VakıfBank improved automation and became fully integrated through a centralized mainframe computer system. In 1982, in an effort to conduct banking operations in a more dynamic manner and serve the particular needs of various regions, VakıfBank established regional directorates in Istanbul, the Aegean and the Çukurova regions. =1990s= In the early 1990s, VakıfBank increased the scope of its consumer lending and diversified its loan portfolio by broadening its lending practices to include equipment financing, enterprise loans, auto loans, housing loans as well as loans for marriage, vacation and education. It began to expand its credit card business by adopting principles of reputation credit and increasing its base of merchant customers, students and working class employees as well as by automating and centralizing its point of sale authorization system. VakıfBank also laid the groundwork to become a leader in alternative distribution channels by introducing self-service banking, telephone banking, and a mobile bank branch office – a full-service branch office on wheels Autobank. VakıfBank was the first in Turkey to offer payment services by credit card over the telephone. In 1993, VakıfBank obtained its first syndicated loan in an amount of US$ 38.5 million and established Vakıf Offshore in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. In 1995, VakıfBank overhauled its management structure in order to modernize and conform with contemporary bank management practices. VakıfBank also established its New York branch in order to increase its exposure to international markets. The New York branch conducts international operations, including trade finance and corporate banking. In 1996, VakıfBank established Vakıf Gayrimenkul, a real estate investment trust, and Vakıf Risk Sermayesi Yatirim Ortakligi A.Ş., the first venture capital company in Turkey. In 1997, VakıfBank conducted its first securitization for US$ 130 million in relation to credit and debit card receivables. In 1998, VakıfBank established its first home banking platform for customers with substantial business volume. VakıfBank also installed new computer systems to automate import and export transactions within the branch network for those branches conducting trade finance activities. VakıfBank became the first in Turkey to offer long-term home loans with maturities of up to 20 years. VakıfBank also introduced the VakifBank Primary Schools program, a scheme designed to turn former branch offices into schools for homeless children. =2000s= In 2000, VakıfBank completed its first Eurobond issue for €200 million with a term of three years. In addition, VakıfBank’s subsidiaries, Güneş Insurance, Vakıf Financial Leasing, Vakıf Investment Trust Company, Vakıf Real Estate Investment Trust Company and Vakıf Venture Capital Company all offered their shares to the public and listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. In 2001, VakıfBank also introduced internet banking with the launch of its internet site. VakıfBank currently has over 751,869 internet banking customers, an increase of almost 50% since 2003. In 2001, VakıfBank completed the first long-term borrowing following the Turkish economic crisis through the securitization of diversified payment rights for an amount of US$ 200 million and a term of five years. VakıfBank also became the first Turkish commercial bank to launch a syndicated loan facility following the economic crisis for an amount of US$ 110 million. Also in 2001, VakıfBank established a senior risk committee as well as a bank-wide risk committee, an internal control department and a new data processing center. In 2002, VakıfBank had the largest number of credit cards issued in Turkey and ranked first in Europe in terms of the number of Maestro cards issued by a banking institution, according to Mastercard. In 2003, VakıfBank continued its strategy to expand its customer base by effectively promoting both existing and new services to a larger segment of the population, including the upper middle class, middle- aged individuals with a steady source of income. VakıfBank borrowed US$ 200 million in a syndicated deal in which 36 banks participated, including 14 arrangers. In July 2005, VakıfBank increased this syndicated loan to US$ 750 million with 62 banks, including 34 arrangers. In September 2005, VakıfBank closed the 2005‑A Tranche of its new diversified payment rights securitization program which amounted to US$ 750 million. The securitization resulted in the sale of the diversified payment rights to the SPC. Also in 2005, VakıfBank and VakıfBank Pension Fund sold, respectively, 27,900 million and 4,300 million Class D common shares of VakıfBank in the IPO, representing 21.8% and 3.37%, respectively, of VakıfBank’s total shares. Since 2003, VakıfBank has initiated the following projects: a marketing and sales oriented new branch organization to promote customer satisfaction; the Remote Access (EXAPI System) enabling VakıfBank’s customers to trade directly on the Istanbul Stock Exchange; the First Step Mutual Fund for parents wanting to invest for their children; and a branded credit card program for groups such as students, teachers and soldiers as well as the Supporter Credit Card for the fans of the three most popular football clubs in Turkey Super League. =Present= In September 2004, VakıfBank mandated an international consultancy firm to review the financial and operational performance of VakıfBank. VakıfBank continues to improve operating efficiencies and overall performance through a number of initiatives including: organizational restructuring, including the reorganization of VakıfBank’s head office and the consolidation of certain business units to create increased operating efficiencies; increasing its focus on customers, including expanding its customer base, cross-selling to existing customers and improving customer service by utilizing both its extensive branch network as well as its continually expanding range of alternative distribution channels; remodeling nearly all of its existing branches and exploring opportunities for new branch openings, particularly in the Marmara region; focusing on sales at the branch level by shifting staff to sales functions; increasing its investment in human resources and optimizing personnel utilization; upgrading and overhauling the capacity and quality of its information technology systems, hardware and applications throughout both VakıfBank’s headquarters and its branch network; and developing its internal control functions, including the implementation of regional portfolio managers in its commercial banking operations and increasing responsibility at the branch level.

The articles of association of VakifBank provide for the board of directors to have nine members appointed for a term of three years. Pursuant to recent changes made by Law No. 5387, the breakdown of the board of directors of VakifBank is determined according to its articles of association, except that one member of the board (who is also the general manager of VakifBank) is appointed by the prime minister to represent the GDF.

Class D shareholders do not have direct board representation.

Once Roosevelt obtained permission from the U.S. Congress to form a volunteer Army to help in France, Major Burnham was enlisted by the Club to raise the troops in the Western states and to coordinate recruitment efforts. Wilson ultimately rejected Roosevelt's plan and the volunteer Army disbanded. During the war, the club also raised $500,000 in relief funds for Belgium war refugees, and after the war it played a prominent part in helping U.S. soldiers from Western States re-incorporate into American society.

The film is the highest- grossing film of all time at the box office in France. Plot Philippe Abrams is the manager of the French post office (La Poste) branch in Salon-de- Provence, Bouches-du-Rhône, in southern France. He is married to Julie, whose negative character makes his life miserable. Philippe does everything to get a job at an office on the Mediterranean coast to make her happy. As this desirable position will only be granted to a disabled person, Abrams pretends that he is – and is found out by the management. As punishment, he is banished for two years to Bergues, a town near Dunkirk in northern France. Northern France – and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region in particular – is considered \\"the sticks\\" – a cold and rainy place inhabited by unsophisticated ch'tis who speak a strange dialect (called \\"ch'ti in local parlance, and \\"cheutimi in the South). He has to spend his first night at the home of Antoine, a member of his staff. Philippe initially dislikes Antoine for his obnoxious behaviour and because he initially thinks Antoine is gay but, later he finds out that he secretly has a crush on Annabelle, one of the workers at the post office. However, Antoine and Philippe later become best friends. To Philippe's surprise, Bergues proves to be a charming place teeming with warm, friendly people and co-workers. Soon, he is completely won over, eating strong smelling Maroilles cheese; talking to virtually every local (by delivering their mail, and accepting the recipients' invitation for a drink); playing at the beach; playing the carillon at the bell tower together, drinking beer like a local, going to an RC Lens football match and so forth. He tries to describe the happy turn of events to his wife who has remained in the South with their young son, but she does not believe him. This inspires Philippe to tell her what she wants to believe; that his life is wretched there. Everything goes fine until Julie decides to join him in the North to relieve his gloom. Philippe is forced to confess to his new friends and colleagues that he has described them as barbarians to his wife. First, they are angry, but they then decide to help him by behaving as such to cover for his lies and to scare Julie so she will depart quickly. Also they let her stay in the old mining village near Bergues, pretending it is the main town. Julie has a very bad weekend, but decides she will move to Bergues to stay with Philippe, to be supportive. Just when she's ready to go back south, she discovers that she has been tricked when a local tells Julie that the actual town of Bergues is several kilometers away. When Philippe finds Julie at his real Bergues home, he tells her the truth about the happiness and friendship that the town has brought him. Julie is disappointed at first, but after realising her husband is happy, she decides to move north to be with him. Meanwhile, Antoine and Annabelle had been dating for over a year, but had broken up due to Antoine's passiveness towards his overbearing mother. Despite their split, Antoine still has feelings for Annabelle, who now has a new boyfriend. Upon learning this, Antoine cheers himself up by drinking alcohol during his work hours and behaves in an erratic manner. When Philippe urges Antoine to take courage and be assertive, Antoine finally confesses to his mother that he loves Annabelle and is planning to move to a new place with her. Unexpectedly, his mother is happy about it – she has waited all these years for Antoine to stand up for himself. As a result, Antoine proposes to Annabelle by the bell tower when it is playing a Stevie Wonder song. Annabelle accepts, and they get married. Three years later, Philippe receives a transfer to move south. Accepting the offer, Philippe and his family move south. Just as he is about to say goodbye, he is reduced to tears, proving Antoine's theory on the Ch'tis proverb (\\"A visitor brays [cries] twice up north; once on his arrival and once at his departure\\").

The plot was similar to the original: Alberto (Claudio Bisio), the manager of a Poste Italiane office in Lombardy is banished for two years to Castellabate, a small town in Campania. Article on the Corriere del Mezzogiorno Dany Boon appeared in a cameo. Unlike the French original, the Italian franchise led to a sequel: Benvenuti al Nord (\\"Welcome to the North\\"; 2012). In 2017, the Dutch remake Weg van jou (a play on words that both means 'away from you' and 'smitten with you') ran in Dutch theatres. In this remake, city slicker Evi gets relocated from metropolitan and cosmopolitan Rotterdam to the rural Dutch province of Zeeland. In Zeeland, while away from her stuck- up boyfriend, she gets smitten with a local man. Negotiations regarding a proposed English version of the film were officially abandoned in 2015.Marine Delcambre, 2015, \\"'Benvenue Chez Les Ch'tis': Will Smith Abandonne Le Remake\\", GQ France (30 January). (via Google Translate; access 17 August 2015) As early as 2008, Will Smith was negotiating with Dany Boon regarding a remake; the US film was to be called Welcome to the Sticks. While few other details were revealed, there were suggestions that the plot would revolve around a multinational company, rather than US Mail. Soundtrack The CD soundtrack, including the scores of La Maison du Bonheur and Nothing to Declare, were all composed by Philippe Rombi.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Blackburn, the archdeaconry of Lancaster and the deanery of Kirkham. History The earliest evidence of a church on the site is in 684 AD. Kirkham was one of the oldest foundations in Lancashire and one of only three listed in the Doomsday Book as existing in Amounderness. This hundred was part of the vast possessions of Roger earl of Poictou and the church was held by the Priory Church of St. Mary, Lancaster. William of York (died 1154) issued a charter to return the church to Shrewsbury Abbey. In a later charter, dated 5 December 1280, King Edward I conveyed the advowson of Kirkham to the abbott and convent of Vale Royal Abbey which held the church until the Dissolution in the reign King Henry VIII. It was then given to the dean and chapter of Christ Church, Oxford.Porter, J. MRCS, LSA (1878) History of the Fylde of Lancashire, Fleetwood and Blackpool, W. Porter and Sons Publisher, Chapter II – Ecclesiastical History. The first recorded vicar, in May 1239, was Will de Ebor, also described as \\"Cancus de Ebor\\" and said to have been appointed by Richard Duke of Cornwall.Porter, J. MRCS, LSA (1878) History of the Fylde of Lancashire, Fleetwood and Blackpool, W. Porter and Sons Publisher, Chapter IV – The Vicars of Kirkham. The first christenings recorded in the parish register are those of Thomas Sharrock and Henry Cowbron in March 1539.Porter, J. MRCS, LSA (1878) History of the Fylde of Lancashire, Fleetwood and Blackpool, W. Porter and Sons Publisher, Chapter VI – The Church Wardens and the Parish Registers. Porter also notes that the monumental inscriptions in the church \\".. are not either very ancient or very numersous\\", with the oldest being that of Richard Clegg, M.A., made vicar on 22 June 1666, let into the floor of the vestry.Porter, J. MRCS, LSA (1878) History of the Fylde of Lancashire, Fleetwood and Blackpool, W. Porter and Sons Publisher, Chapter VII – The Monumemts and Inscriptions in the Church and Churchyard at Kirkham. The fabric of the present church dates from 1822 when the nave, designed by Robert Roper, an architect from Preston, was built. The cost of the nave was £5,000 (). In 1843–44 the steeple, designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe, and built in Longridge stone, was added at the west end. The foundation stone for this was laid on 21 November 1843 by Thomas Clifton of Lytham Hall. In 1853 the chancel was rebuilt, probably by Joseph Hansom, to make the altar visible from the nave. The north and south galleries were removed in the middle of the 20th century and the area under the west gallery has been turned into a separate room. In 2004 it was discovered that the spire had developed structural problems because the iron ties reinforcing the stones had corroded. An appeal to repair the spire was launched. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in sandstone ashlar with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave without aisles, a three-bay chancel with aisles which are now used as vestries. To the north and south gabled porches project slightly from the second bays from west. The other bays have lancet windows between gabled buttresses. The nave is in Early English style and the chancel is in Decorated style. The steeple is in Perpendicular style. It has angle buttresses and is in four stages. The parapet is embattled and pinnacles rise from the corners. The octagonal spire is recessed and rises to a height of . It is crocketed, has three tiers of two-light lucarnes and is supported by four flying buttresses. The authors of the Buildings of England series consider it to be \\"perhaps the finest work of Edmund Sharpe\\". =Interior= The roof of the nave is painted red and is divided into squares by ribs, at whose intersections are gilded bosses of different designs. The font is located halfway down the north side of the nave. It is Victorian and consists of an octagonal gabled and crocketted bowl on an octagonal column. The wooden pulpit is massive, measuring approximately from the base to the top. To the east of the south door are churchwardens' box pews carved with Gothic details and poppyheads. They bear a brass plate dated 1770. In the nave are monuments to the memory of the Cliftons of Lytham Hall, including one to Thomas Clifton who died in 1688. A wall tablet commemorates Richard Bradkirk of Bryning Hall who died in 1813 and another monument is to Henry Rishton Buck, a lieutenant aged 27 who died at the Battle of Waterloo. Behind the altar is a folding reredos dated 1900 which was made by Kempe and moved from Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The brass chandelier dated 1725 was made by Brown of Wigan. The organ dates back to 1769 when it was built by Glyn Parker of Salford. Later modifications were made by R. W. Nicholson of Bradford (at an unrecorded date), by Harrison & Harrison in 1905, and by the Pendlebury Organ Company of Cleveleys in 1979. There is a ring of eight bells which were cast by Charles & George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1846.

When the sides of the book are made of vellum, the bookbinding method is also known as limp vellum. The cover is made with a single piece of vellum or alternative material, folded around the textblock, the front and back covers being folded double. The quires are sewn onto sewing supports such as cords or alum-tawed thongs and the tips of the sewing supports would be laced into the cover. The thongs could also be used at the fore edge of the covers to create a closure or tie. In limp binding the covering material is not stiffened by thick boards, although paste-downs, if used, provide some stiffness; some limp bindings are only adhered to the back of the book. Some limp vellum bindings had yapp edges that flop over to protect the textblock. Usage Orazio Borgianni, detail of The Vision of St Jerome, standing on a limp vellum bound book with fore-edge ties. Limp vellum bindings for commonplace books were being produced at least as early as the 14th century and probably earlier, but it was not usually common until the 16th and 17th centuries. Its usage subsequently declined until \\"revived by the private presses near the end of the 19th century.\\" From about 1775 to 1825, limp leather was commonly used for pocket books, but by the 1880s limp bindings came to be largely restricted to devotional books, diaries, and sentimental verse, sometimes with yapp edges. Yapp edges are bent edges on a limp binding projecting beyond the textblock to reduce damage. They are often found in editions of the Bible.

He and his brother Maccus were active in the lands around the Irish Sea in the 970s and 980s. Origins Gofraid and Maccus are usually assumed to be members of the Uí Ímair, a kin group tracing its descent from Ímar (died 873), sometimes identified with the saga-character Ivar the Boneless. Their father Aralt or Harald is usually identified with the Aralt mac Sitric, king of Norse-Gael Limerick, who was killed in Connacht in 940. This identification would make Maccus and Gofraid nephews of Amlaíb Cuarán, the King of Dublin. An alternative proposal, advanced by Benjamin Hudson, makes Gofraid and Maccus sons of a Viking chief named Harald who was active in Normandy, but this has received little support. Activities The first record of Gofraid is probably an attack on Anglesey in 971 by a son of Harald. The Brut y Tywysogion states that it was Gofraid who led this. The following year he collected tribute from Anglesey. He probably led a raid on Powys in 979, and in 980 was allied with Custennin ap Iago, and they again ravaged Anglesey, but Custennin was killed by Hywel ap Ieuaf. Chester was attacked in 980, the attackers perhaps led by Gofraid. In 982 he was again in Wales, this time in the southwest attacking Dyfed. In 984, along with Maccus, he brought a fleet to Waterford, where they joined up with Brian Bóruma, king of Munster, and Ivar of Waterford, king of Waterford. Their combined armies and fleets attacked Dublin. An unnamed son of Harald won a battle on the Isle of Man in 987, but whether this was Maccus or Gofraid is unclear. Gofraid attacked Anglesey for the third time in 987, according to the Brut y Tywysogion, taking 2,000 captives. Gofraid died in 989, said to be killed in Dál Riata, but whether this refers to the Glens of Antrim or perhaps to some part of the western coasts of Scotland is unclear. The notice of his death calls him king of Innse Gall, that is the Hebrides. Gofraid and Maccus are both usually included in lists of rulers of the Isle of Man. Descendants Gofraid's son Ragnall died in Munster in 1005, and he too is called king of the Hebrides. Echmarcach mac Ragnaill may or may not have been Gofraid's grandson, as he is also contended to have been a grandchild or great- grandchild of Ivar of Waterford. The same is the case for Cacht ingen Ragnaill, queen of Donnchad mac Briain, often assumed to be Echmarcach's sister. The Banshenchas record that a daughter of one Gofraid named Máel Muire married Gilla Pátraic mac Donnchada, king of Osraige. If this is correct, Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic, later King of Leinster, was this Gofraid's grandson, and all subsequent kings of Osraige and members of the FitzPatrick dynasty are their descendants. Although lacking a patronymic, scholars have identified him with Gofraid mac Arailt. Lagmann, whom William of Jumièges calls \\"king of Swedes\\", probably an error for \\"king of the Sudreys\\", the Norse name for the Hebrides, is believed to have been a son of Gofraid. Lagmann's son Amlaíb is said by the Cogadh Gáedhel re Gallaibh to have been killed at the Battle of Clontarf and his genealogy is given there linking Lagmann and Gofraid.

Among the artists recorded by Cicalo are The Monkees, Carole King, Barbra Streisand, and George Harrison. Early career In 1957, Cicalo started in the mastering room at Capitol Records, then progressed to second engineer and worked with many great engineers like John Krause, Hugh Davies, John Palladino, and Pete Abbott. Some of the artists' albums he worked on were Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Nat King Cole. He moved up to engineer while at Capitol and worked with such notables as Cannonball Adderley, Peggy Lee, Ed Ames and Lou Rawls. In 1963, Cicalo began work for RCA Records in Hollywood. As one of the lead engineers at RCA, he worked with artists including Eddy Arnold, Vic Damone, Ann-Margret, Eddie Fisher, Peter Nero, Duke Ellington, Wayne Newton and Tommy Leonetti. In the mid-1960s, Cicalo also worked closely with Tom Mack, producer for Dot Records. Their projects included The Mills Brothers, The Lennon Sisters, Jimmie Rodgers, Glen Campbell, Ernie Andrews, Frankie Carle, and Harry James. Their biggest project together was Lalo Schifrin's Mission Impossible, for which Cicalo was nominated for his first Grammy Award. The Monkees While at RCA Records in Hollywood, California, Cicalo recorded The Monkees for Colgems Records. In total, he did four albums with the band, including The Monkees, More of The Monkees, Live 1967, and Headquarters. All three studio albums with the group went multi-platinum, each reaching number one on the Billboard charts. The Monkees' Headquarters album was their first to feature all four band members playing instruments. Lacking experience as a recording group, the sessions dragged out from a normal two or three weeks to a full six weeks. Cicalo worked patiently with the Monkees and their producer Chip Douglas (himself a first-time producer), and the album came together as the band learned about making records. As a thank-you to Cicalo, the Monkees gave him the writing credit for their song \\"No Time\\" (included on Headquarters). This briefly got Cicalo into trouble, as RCA had a rule against engineers soliciting songs for recording. When matters were explained, Cicalo was able to collect the writer's royalties (which, he says, was used to buy a house). Released to praise and brisk sales, Headquarters was a huge success. Cicalo also recorded the scores for the popular Monkees television show and engineered tracks on The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees, Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd., and Head. Cicalo toured with the band in 1967 and recalled that the most frightening experience he ever had was being attacked by a mob of teenage girls while in a limousine with The Monkees. Cicalo also engineered Mike Nesmith's first solo album, The Wichita Train Whistle Sings. Tapestry In the 1970s, Cicalo went to work for A & M and Ode Records. He engineered Carole King's landmark Tapestry album. Tapestry was the second solo album for Carole on the Ode label, but the first album Cicalo engineered. Released in February 1971, Tapestry was number one on the Billboard charts for fifteen consecutive weeks, and held a record for most weeks at number one that lasted over forty years. Cicalo also worked with Carole on Rhymes & Reasons, Fantasy, Wrap Around Joy, Really Rosie, and Thoroughbred. During the 1970s, Cicalo also continued to do freelance projects. He worked with George Harrison at his Friar Park recording studio to make Harrison's Thirty-Three & 1/3, and also worked with Barbra Streisand on her ButterFly album. Later career The late 1980s and 1990s saw Cicalo back in the studio, recording and mixing albums: Dreams & Themes by Patrick Williams, Body and Soul and The Groove Shop by Clayton Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, Once More…With Feeling by Doc Severinsen & The Tonight Show Band. In 1995, Cicalo recorded and produced Professional Dreamer by Kenny Rankin; it was a chance for Rankin to record many of his favorite jazz standards. In 1992, Cicalo recorded the popular children's album, Pure Imagination, by Michael Feinstein. It was the beginning of a collaboration that resulted in several subsequent recordings. He engineered Isn’t It Romantic, That’s Entertainment, Hugh Martin Songbook, as well as Such Sweet Sorrow, and Nice Work If You Can Get It – which he also co-produced. Though he had worked with him on earlier projects, Cicalo is particularly proud of Rawls Sings Sinatra, which he recorded with Lou Rawls in 2003. It was one of the last Lou Rawls projects, and Cicalo enjoyed working with Rawls again, as well as with producer Billy Vera. Cicalo's most recent album is the two-CD 2008 release: Tapestry – Legacy Edition. References *The Monkees Tale, Eric Lefcowitz (Last Gasp Press) () *Monkeemania!

Reeves was deregistered in 2004 for performing obstetric procedures at Pambula and Bega hospitals despite being banned from obstetrics, and in September 2008 was charged in relation to alleged sexual and indecent assaults and genital mutilation at Bega, Pambula and Richmond between 2001 and 2003. He was sentenced in relation to assaults in 2011. Medical career = Northern Sydney = Reeves worked in several northern Sydney hospitals in obstetrics from 1985 until 1997 when his obstetrics practice was restricted, and in gynaecology until 2000. Reeves was first appointed as a visiting medical officer in obstetrics and gynaecology at Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital on 20 December 1985. 35 complaints were made about him over a fifteen-year period starting in June 1986 by other doctors, nurses and patients, and included complaints of bullying other staff and patients and failing to offer adequate pain relief. In 1995 two attending midwives and a paediatric registrar complained that Reeves had bullied a patient delivering a non-viable foetus, had not offered adequate pain relief and had declined their offers to resuscitate her. In May 1996 a patient of Reeves' at The Hills Private Hospital died of septicaemia after he refused antibiotics, and that hospital suspended his privileges as a medical officer there. The Hills Hospital also noted his aggressive conduct and observed that similar problems were known from both Hornsby Ku-ring-gai and Sydney Adventist Hospital. By January 1997 a hospital advisory committee had made an adverse finding about Reeves and a Professional Standards Committee handed down a decision in August placing limits on Reeves' practice in obstetrics. The hospital suspended him from the gynaecology clinic on 14 December 2000 after midwives refused to work with him and his position was never restored. Psychiatric reports dating from as early as 1996 and continuing until 2004 report that Reeves has been variously identified as having narcissistic personality disorder. =Greater Southern Area Health Service= Despite the restrictions on his practice, Reeves practised obstetrics in Greater Southern Area Health Service (GSAHS) hospitals in the South Coast region of New South Wales from April 2002 until January 2003, and gynaecology until the termination of his contract in July 2003. Reeves was hired as an obstetrician and gynaecologist by GSAHS in 2002, beginning work in April. Reeves' application for the position provided partial information about restrictions on his registration, but not the Professional Standards Committee's order that he not practice obstetrics. GSAHS did not verify with the Medical Board that Reeves was allowed to practice in the specialties he was hired for. The restriction on his practice was revealed during a reference check in April, but not acted on. His hiring was promoted by local papers as a boon for women in the area. By the end of 2002, complaints and memos were prepared about difficult working relationships between Reeves and staff at Pambula Hospital. In November, discussions between the Medical Board and GSAHS revealed that Reeves was not allowed to practice as an obstetrician, and as a result from 14 November Pambula Hospital did not provide obstetric services. In 2003 there were complaints that Reeves had provided obstetric services to a patient at Bega Hospital on 3 January, and GSAHS became aware that, Reeves' undertaking to the contrary, he had not applied to the Board for a review of the restriction on his obstetric practice. On 10 January further complaints about Reeves' conduct towards other staff became known to Bega Hospital management, but as they were pursuing his unauthorised practice of obstetrics, these complaints about conduct were not pursued. After the complaints about unauthorised obstetric practice at Bega Hospital, GSAHS continued to allow Reeves to practice as a gynaecologist, uncertain as to whether they had the power to suspend him. On 18 February 2003, the Medical Board ordered that Reeves' ban from obstetric practice continue and on 7 April GSAHS notified Reeves of the forthcoming termination of his contract, although Reeves continued to provide gynaecological services up to 11 July, the last day of his contract. Jon Mortimer, the GSAHS Deputy Director of Medical Services, was suspended on full pay in May 2008 for failing to act on the information about Reeves' obstetrics ban revealed in the April 2002 reference check. =Deregistration= Reeves was struck from the register of doctors (forbidden to practice medicine) in 1999, on the grounds that he had breached the Medical Board's 1997 ban on his practicing obstetrics, and had thus been guilty of gross misconduct. Media reports The first public media report alleging further serious misconduct by Reeves while employed by GSAHS was on 17 February 2008, in a broadcast of the Sunday programme on the Nine Network, led by investigative journalist, Ross Coulthart. Reeves' former patient Carolyn Dewaegeneire alleged that in 2002 Reeves had conducted a clitoridectomy rather than remove a small genital lesion, and had informed her that he was going to do so seconds before anaesthesia took effect. Expert witnesses in an earlier civil case surrounding this procedure noted that the procedure Reeves performed on Dewaegeneire was old-fashioned, that informed consent was not given and that Reeves should have sought a second opinion on her rare diagnosis. The media began to report additional complaints by Reeves' patients in February 2008, such as Marilyn Hawkins' allegation that he both sexually assaulted her and botched her operation. By 25 February private lobbying group the Medical Errors Action Group reported that they had complaints related to 185 separate incidents. By 26 February Reeves, who had been living in Castle Hill, had gone into hiding. Political response In June 2008, the Medical Practice Amendment Bill 2008 obliged doctors in New South Wales to report serious misconduct on the part of their colleagues, specifically intoxication while practising, sexual abuse while practising and large violations of professional standards of care. =NSW Health Department review= On 2 May 2008, retired judge Deirdre O'Connor reported to the NSW Health Department on procedural aspects of Reeves' appointment and was satisfied that changes made to Health Department hiring policy since Reeve's appointment at Southern Area Health Service were sufficient to end the practice of doctors like him much earlier in future. The report contradicted Health Minister Reba Meagher's claims that the GSAHS had done no background checks on Reeves. The State Government was criticised for not releasing the report until 28 May. Medical community response The Medical Board stated that the allegations had not been raised at the time of his de-registration, and as Reeves was no longer allowed to practice, there was no further sanction that the Board was capable of making. In late February 2008 the NSW Department of Health established counselling services for former patients of Reeves. General practitioners in Bega complained that the press had created an unfair suspicion surrounding the local medical community and maintained that they had not been aware of any dissatisfaction with Reeves during his employment by GSAHS. Investigations of criminal activity = Police investigations = The NSW Police established Strike Force Tarella on 27 February 2008, comprising 12 detectives from both the Child Protection and Sex Crimes Squad and the far south coast local area command. By May, they were investigating deaths of ten babies and seven women under Reeves' care, with most of the babies classified as stillborn, which did not require a coronial inquiry into their deaths. =Garling Commission= In May 2008 Reeves made a statement to a Special Commission of Inquiry into the public health system stating that he had worked illegally at the GSAHS hospitals because he felt his help was badly needed. He also expressed regret for his actions. The Commission, headed by Peter Garling, was convened in January 2008 and its scope is to investigate the standard of patient care in public hospitals. On 31 July 2008, Garling handed down his findings on the Reeves case and concluded that his \\"intentional and calculated dishonesty\\" was the main reason he was employed by GSAHS. Garling recommended that the case be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The report also found that Jon Mortimer and Robert Arthurson of GSAHS should have carried out greater background checks of Reeves. =Extortion attempt= In June 2008, three people were charged in Bega Local Court with an extortion attempt against an unnamed former colleague of Reeves'. They had threatened to make the connection between Reeves and the colleague public. Two of the three, mother and son Kathryn and Luke Nathan Fisher, pleaded guilty in May 2009 and were placed on good behaviour bonds. Charges against Benjamin Fisher were withdrawn. Criminal charges and trial In September 2008 police announced that they were laying 17 criminal charges against Reeves, relating to 10 alleged victims at Bega, Pambula and Richmond between 2001 and 2003. He was arrested the morning of 10 September and refused bail, to reappear in court in November. In April 2009 his Legal Aid lawyers sought an adjournment of his Downing Local Court trial in order to familiarise themselves with the case and in August 2009 he was ordered to stand trial after waiving a committal hearing. In December 2009 Reeves was arrested on additional charges to those laid in 2008. On 10 March 2011 a NSW District Court found him guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Carolyn DeWaegeneire, whose genitals he removed without her consent. On 1 July he was sentenced for a two to three-and-a-half-year period for the assault on DeWaegeneire and other patients, together with the financial deception involved in practicing obstetrics in Bega without registration. The Director of Public Prosecutions announced an intention to appeal the sentence later that month. Reeves was released from jail on 20 December 2013 after an appeal to the High Court.http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/butcher-of-bega-graeme-reeves- released-from-jail-20131228-300fo.html References Living people 1949 births Australian gynaecologists Australian obstetricians Australian people convicted of indecent assault Medical malpractice Medical doctors from Sydney People with narcissistic personality disorder 20th-century Australian medical doctors 21st-century Australian medical doctors ","title":"Graeme Stephen Reeves"},{"id":"16044550","text":"This page describes the different types of academic dress allowed at the University of Exeter.

His father Valentin Dont was a noted cellist. Jakob was a student of Josef Böhm (1795–1876) and of Georg Hellmesberger (1800–1873). At the age of sixteen, he became a member of the Hofburgtheater orchestra and in 1834 entered service at the Vienna Hofkapelle. During this time Dont appeared frequently as a soloist. Despite his success, he decided against a career as a soloist. In 1853 he became a professor at the Pädagogisches Institut in Vienna. From 1871, Dont was employed at the Wiener Konservatorium. He would eventually leave this post as the use of his own instructional compositions was forbidden. Dont's compositions are mainly limited to innovative teaching material. His 24 Etudes and Caprices Gradus ad parnassum Op. 35 and the 24 Exercises Preparatory to the Studies of R. Kreutzer and P. Rode Op. 37 are considered some of the most important technical studies for the violin. Among his students was Leopold Auer.

The church and the courtyard of the Basilica of the Birth of the Virgin Mary stand in the centre of Chełm on Chełm Hill (also called Cathedral Hill or Castle Hill). Over its history, the church has been Ukrainian Orthodox, Ukrainian Catholic (also known as Greek Catholic), and Roman Catholic. Surrounding the basilica's grounds is a city park and a cemetery. Description The basilica is a former complex of Orthodox Church and Basilian Monastery. It was founded in the first half of the 13th century by Danylo Romanowych and served as an Orthodox Church and then as a Greek Catholic Church. The present church was founded in 1735-56 by the Greek Catholic Chełm bishop Philip Włodkowic and was built according to the plans of Paweł Fontana. It is a late baroque church built in the shape of a Latin cross, three-aisled basilica with a huge eight- part dome. History A former Greek Catholic Cathedral and currently the Parish church, the Basilica of the Virgin Mary stands on the site of an Orthodox church of the same name, founded by Daniel Romanowicz in about 1260. After a fire in 1640, it was rebuilt by bishop Metody Terlecki who introduced some small changes. As the years went by, the church needed to be enlarged and in 1711 bishop Józef Lewicki began repair works and built a transept. Unfortunately, it turned out that the work was done so unreliably that the building was close to collapse. The successor of Lewicki, bishop Felicjan Wołodkowicz considered the building's condition to be so bad that renovation was no longer an option and therefore commissioned its demolition. In 1735 the work began and a completely new, much bigger church was built, which was ready in 1756. That time, in curia sat on bishop Maksymilian Rylo, who finished the investment and founded rich decoration of sanctuary.Bazylika Narodzenia Najświętszej Maryi Panny On 15 September 1765 the church was the place of the coronation of the marvellous painting of the Our Lady of Chełm. The painting was revered throughout the country because of its connection with the victory in the Battle of Berestechko that took place in 1651.Miejski Serwis Informacyjny - History The painting was taken by Russian forces in 1915 and is currently kept in Lutsk, Ukraine.ZAPRASZAMY DO CHEŁMA - serwis prowadzony przez Chełmski Ośrodek Informacji Turystycznej In 1802 the Greek Catholic Church was consumed by fire but its walls stayed intact for a long time. Finally, in 1827 bishop Ferdynand Dąbrowa-Ciechanowski, at the expense of the treasury of the Kingdom of Poland, rebuilt the sanctuary. After the incursion of Austrian troops into Chełm (in 1915), the cathedral was used as an army warehouse.Sanktuarium Maryjne na Górze Chełmskiej - Dzieje Kościoła Mariackiego na Górze Chełmskiej: Strona 3 In May 1919 the Polish authorities donated the church to Catholic clergy. In May 1940 the German occupation authorities gave the cathedral to Ukrainians. In November, the same year, the Orthodox diocese was formed. Soon after the liberation of Poland, 24 August 1944, by the decision of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, Chełm's cathedral was given to the Catholic Church. Architecture It is a late baroque church built in the shape of a Latin cross, three-ailed basilica with a huge eight-part dome. Modest interior decoration—the church was twice changed into Russian Orthodox Church (1875–1918 and 1940–1944). In front of the basilica there is a detached belfry from 1878 rebuilt and heightened in the interwar times. Next to the basilica there is a Basilian Monastery founded in 1640-49 by the bishop Metodiusz Terlecki and the bishop Jakub Susza—the principal of the first Chełm secondary school. Nowadays it serves as a living quarter. In the main altar there is a copy of a missing during the First World War painting of the Chełm Virgin Mary and a late baroque silver antependium showing the king Jan Kazimierz paying tributes to the Chełm Virgin Mary after winning the battle at Beresteczko in 1651. Surroundings Uściłuska Gate There are also many monuments surrounding the Basilica which are connected with the history of Chełm. The most important, famous and worth visiting are: * Uściługska Gate ['Brama Uściłuska'] (built in the 17th-18th centuries) * the Uniate Bishops Palace ['Pałac biskupów unickich'] (built in 1711) * the Basilian Monastery ['Klasztor Bazylianów'] (1640–1649) * the Building of the Orthodox Virgin Mary Brotherhood in Chełm ['Budynek Chełmskiego Prawosławnego Bractwa bogurodzicy'] (end of 19th century) * the Belfry ['Dzwonnica'] (1878) Pilrimage centre Every year, 7 and 8 September are days of the festival of the Virgin Mary.

It has about 1,900 inhabitants. It is located about 5 km north of Kladno. The village occupies an upper part of right slope of broad valley of the Knovízský stream, just on northwestern edge of large elevated plateau called Rovina (\\"The Plains\\"). Administrative parts Pchery proper consist of two formerly distinct villages of Pchery and Humny, which today form one built-up area. Village of Theodor, once a late 19th-century miners' settlement in vicinity of former colliery of the same name, located about 1.5 km to the southeast, also forms an administrative part of Pchery. History The first mention of Pchery dates back to 13th century. In a document from about 1227–1228 it was stated to be in property of the Saint George Cloister of Prague Castle. Sights Parish church of St. Stephen in Pchery was first attested in tithe registry in 1352. It was enlarged from one to three naves in Baroque style in 1706. Above the church there stands a belfry built around half of 18th century. A wind power plant has been operating on a field about 1 km northeast of Pchery since April 1, 2008. It consists of two towers of 88 m in height, each equipped with a 3MW wind turbine supplied by Finnish manufacturer WinWinD. As of 2008 it was the most powerful wind power plant in the Czech Republic. As of 2020 is 12th–13th most powerful and the most powerful in the Central Bohemian Region.

It was launched on 11 July 1990 into an orbit around Earth with a height of 375 km and an inclination of 51.6 degrees. It lasted for around 2 years. On board the mission were three telescopes, all of which could be pointed at the same source. The project was a joint Soviet-French project. Background Drawing of the Gamma space telescope satellite. The spaceframe and subsystems of the satellite were based on the Progress spacecraft. The Gamma-1 telescope was the main telescope. It consisted of 2 scintillation counters and a gas Cerenkov counter. With an effective area of around , it operated in the energy range of 50 MeV to 6 GeV. At 100 MeV it initially had an angular resolution of 1.5 degrees, with a field of view of 5 degrees and an energy resolution of 12%. A Telezvezda star tracker increased the pointing position accuracy of the Gamma-1 telescope to 2 arcminutes by tracking stars up to an apparent magnitude of 5 within its 6 by 6 degree field of view. However, due to the failure of power to a spark chamber, for most of the mission the resolution was around 10 degrees. The telescope was conceived in 1965, as part of the Soviet Cloud Space Station, which evolved into the Multi-module Orbital Complex (MOK). When work on Gamma finally began in 1972, it was intended to create a Gamma observatory, the first space station module for MOK, the first modular space station in the Salyut programme. For this, it was designed to add the scientific instruments of the observatory to a spacecraft derived from the Progress spacecraft – with the Progress in turn being a Soyuz spacecraft derivate – and that this spacecraft would dock to a MOK space station. However, in 1974, at the time it became a joint venture with France, the MOK space station project was canceled, and in February 1976, the Soviet space program was reconfigured. When on 16 February 1979 production of the telescope was authorized, the plans for the Soviet space station modules had evolved to use the Functional Cargo Block of the TKS spacecraft instead, with the Kvant-1 Roentgen observatory eventually becoming the first such module for Mir – as a result of these changes the Gamma observatory was redesigned as the free flying Gamma satellite. At that time the telescope was authorized in 1979, it was planned to be launched in 1984, but the actual launch was delayed until 1990. Operation The Disk-M telescope operated in the energy range 20 keV - 5 MeV. It consisted of Sodium iodide scintillation crystals, and had an angular resolution of 25 arcminutes. However, it stopped working shortly after the mission was launched. Finally, the Pulsar X-2 telescope had 30 arcminute resolution and a 10 deg x 10 deg field of view, and operated in the energy range 2-25 keV. Observations included studies of the Vela Pulsar, the Galactic Centre, Cygnus X-1, Hercules X-1 and the Crab Nebula. The telescopes also measured the Sun during peak solar activity.

It was launched on 15 November 1972 into the low Earth orbit with a periapsis of 443 km and an apoapsis of 632 km. It completed its observations on 8 June 1973. SAS 2 was the second in the series of small spacecraft designed to extend the astronomical studies in the X-ray, gamma-ray, ultraviolet, visible, and infrared regions. The primary objective of the SAS-B was to measure the spatial and energy distribution of primary galactic and extragalactic gamma radiation which energies between 20 and 300 MeV. The instrumentation consisted principally of a guard scintillation detector, an upper and a lower spark chamber, and a charged particle telescope. SAS-2 was launched from the San Marco platform off the coast of Malindi, Kenya, into a nearly equatorial orbit. The orbiting spacecraft was in the shape of a cylinder approximately 59 cm in diameter and 135 cm in length. Four solar paddles were used to recharge the 6 amp-h nickel-cadmium battery and provide power to the spacecraft and telescope experiment. The spacecraft was spin stabilized, and a magnetically torqued commandable control system was used to point the spin axis of the spacecraft to any position in space within approximately 1 degree. The experiment axis lay along this axis allowing the telescope to look at any selected region of the sky with its plus or minus 30 degree acceptance aperture. The nominal spin rate was 1/12 rpm. Data were taken at 1000 bit/s and could be recorded on an onboard tape recorder and simultaneously transmitted in real time. The recorded data were transmitted once per orbit. This required approximately 5 minutes. The telescope experiment was initially turned on on November 20, 1972, and by November 27 of that year the spacecraft became fully operational. The low-voltage power supply for the experiment failed on June 8, 1973. No useful scientific data were obtained after that date. With the exception of a slightly degraded star sensor, the spacecraft control section performed in an excellent manner.

Era The silver-fork novels dominated the English literature market from the mid-1820s to the mid-1840s. They were often indiscreet, and on occasion \\"keys\\" would circulate that identified the real people on which the principal characters were based. Their emphasis on the relations of the sexes and on marital relationships presaged later development in the novel. Genre and satire of the genre Theodore Hook was a major writer of fashionable novels, and Henry Colburn was a major publisher. Colburn particularly advertised fashionable novels as providing insight into aristocratic life by insiders. Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Benjamin Disraeli and Catherine Gore were other very popular writers of the genre.Catherine Gore 1799(?)-1861 Many were advertised as being written by aristocrats, for aristocrats. As more women wrote the genre, it became increasingly moralized: \\"middle-class morality became central, and the novels detailed the demise of the aristocracy, though the characteristically Byronic heroes of the genre remained.\\" The most popular authors of silver fork novels were women, including Lady Blessington, Catherine Gore and Lady Bury. William Hazlitt coined the term \\"silver fork\\" in an article on “The Dandy School” in 1827. He characterized them as having \\"under-bred tone\\" because while they purported to tell the lives of aristocrats, they were commonly written by the middle-class. Thomas Carlyle wrote Sartor Resartus in critique of their minute detailing of clothing, and William Makepeace Thackeray satirized them in Vanity Fair and Pendennis. In modern culture In Donna Leon's fourth Commissario Guido Brunetti novel, Death and Judgment, English professor Paola Brunetti describes silver fork novels as \\"books written in the eighteenth century, when all that money poured into England from the colonies, and the fat wives of Yorkshire weavers had to be taught which fork to use.\\" See also *Silver spoon References Further reading  History of literature Literary genres Literature of England ","title":"Fashionable novel"},{"id":"16045143","text":"Halkbank is a large Turkish state-owned bank.  History  Halkbank was incorporated in 1933 and began offering services 1938. Between 1938 and 1950, it was a credit union whose purpose was to provide tradesmen and artisans loans on favourable terms in order to promote economic growth in Turkey. In 1950, it began opening branches and granting loans to customers. In 1964, Halkbank embarked upon an ambitious program in which its capital was increased and established a nationwide network of branches. Halkbank absorbed several smaller-sized failed state banks in the 1990s and early 200s: Töbank in 1992, Sümerbank in 1993, Etibank in 1998 and Emlakbank in 2001. One of the major turning points for Halkbank has been the acquisition of Pamukbank in 2004. After this, it underwent a significant restructuring process to prepare for privatization. On 10 May 2007, 24.98% of Halkbank's shares were sold on a public offering and listed in Istanbul Stock Exchange. On 16 November 2012, the percentage of listed shares increased to 48.9%.\\"Halkbank In Brief\\" Retrieved 2020-04-12. Halkbank's head office was moved from Ankara to Istanbul in June 2015.

Iranian oil trading controversy Halkbank was a link in the chain to finance Iranian petroleum interests in the wake of U.S.-led nuclear sanctions.Hart, Matthew, \\"All that glitters is not enriched uranium\\", Globe and Mail, 21 November 2013. In March 2012 Iran was stopped from using the international money transfer system SWIFT. Halkbank seems, between March 2012 and July 2013 while the UN sanctions regime was in place prior to the November 2013 P5+1 agreement, to have purchased some $13bn worth of gold on the open market. The sanctions prevented Iran from being paid in dollars or euros, but gold was never mentioned in the sanctions regime, and therefore this loophole allowed gold to be used to fund the purchase of Iranian petroleum products. Halkbank allowed the middlemen of Iran to buy gold with their Turkish lira, and that gold found its way back to Iranian coffers. One investigation found that US$2bn in gold bullion (about 36 tonnes) was flown from Turkey to Dubai in August 2012 alone. In defending its decision not to enforce its own sanctions, the Obama administration insisted that Turkey only transferred gold to private Iranian citizens. The administration argued that, as a result, this wasn't an explicit violation of its executive order. Iranian Ambassador to Turkey Ali Reza Bikdeli recently praised Halkbank for its \\"smart management decisions in recent years [that] have played an important role in Iranian-Turkish relations.\\" Halkbank stated that there were no sanctions against trading precious metals with Iran until 1 July 2013. Halkbank also had Indian accounts that in 2013 traded with Iran: \\"India now owes Iran $5.3 billion in oil debt. India is planning to pay Iran $1 billion per month – that is $12 billion annually – also through Halkbank.\\" =2013 corruption investigation= In December 2013 Halkbank's CEO Süleyman Aslan was arrested and charged with taking bribes from, amongst others, Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Azeri businessman who had taken Turkish citizenship under the name Sarraf.

Scores of police officials have reportedly been dismissed because their investigations made politicians uncomfortable. The chain of police command was changed so that politicians would be informed of, and could frustrate, police activities. This caused an injunction to be heard in the court system, who blocked the change. A prosecutor was dismissed. The arrest, which came along with many other arrests of officials allied with then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (now President of Turkey), is seen as part of a power struggle between the prime minister and exiled Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen . Oya Özarslan, of the corruption watchdog Transparency International, is worried: \\"[R]ecent changes in the police forces and public prosecutors breaking out this scandal as well as the changes in the regulation of the police forces leave a number of question marks.\\" =U.S. conviction of executive= In March 2017, deputy head of the bank Mehmet Hakan Atilla was arrested by the U.S. government for conspiring to evade sanctions against Iran by helping Zarrab \\"use U.S. financial institutions to engage in prohibited financial transactions that illegally funneled millions of dollars to Iran\\". Zarrab was arrested in Miami, Florida, in March 2016. In Ankara in March 2017, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there was no link between the Turkish request for extradition of Gülen and the arrest of Atilla and that both cases would proceed in conformity with the law. Atilla's trial commenced in New York City federal court in November 2017, with Zarrab agreeing to testify after reaching a plea deal with prosecutors. According to The New York Times, the prosecution of Atilla and others has \\"sent tremors\\" through Turkish political circles. Erdogan has sought, unsuccessfully, to persuade American officials to drop the case, and the state media has been downplaying coverage of the trial. In early 2018, Atilla was convicted on five of six counts against him, including bank fraud and conspiracies and acquitted on one count after four days of jury deliberation. Zarrab was the prime prosecution witness in the seven days of trial testimony. Atilla's sentencing is scheduled for April 2018 and the bank fraud count alone carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.

Early years  La Rue was born in New York City.  Stage  La Rue went from high school to his first acting job, in Otis Skinner's road company production of Blood and Sand. He performed in Broadway plays from around 1923 to 1931. According to La Rue, while appearing in Mae West's play Diamond Lil, he was spotted by Howard Hawks, who offered him a part in the film Scarface (1932), starring Paul Muni.  Film  He moved to Hollywood, where he appeared in numerous films. However, Scarface was not one of them. La Rue stated in a newspaper article that, after four days, Hawks had to replace him with George Raft because La Rue was taller than Muni and had a more powerful voice. Later, however, Raft turned down the role of the despicable villain in The Story of Temple Drake (1933), fearing it would damage his screen image, so the part went to La Rue. Sometimes mistaken for Humphrey Bogart, he played thugs and gangsters for the most part. However, director Frank Borzage atypically cast him as a priest in the 1932 version of A Farewell to Arms simply because, according to newspaper columnist Hubbard Keavy, he was \\"tired of seeing conventional characters\\". La Rue stated he turned down a role in The Godfather (1972) and many parts in the television series The Untouchables because of the way they portrayed Italian-Americans.  Personal life  He was married three times. La Rue married Los Angeles socialite Constance Deighton Simpson on September 22, 1938, in London. She obtained a divorce on December 17, 1946, charging him with mental cruelty. In 1955, he obtained an annulment from former Baroness Violet Edith von Rosenberg after six years of marriage, claiming she had only married him to obtain American citizenship and that they separated after less than two months. He married Anne Giordano on August 12, 1962; she obtained an annulment in 1967. Jack La Rue had no children. La Rue died of a heart attack at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, at the age of 81. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California.

It is now considered to be at risk of extinction.  History  The Pantaneiro derives from Spanish cattle brought to the Americas by the conquistadores at the time of the colonisation of the Río de la Plata basin, and has been raised there for more than three hundred years. From the eighteenth century it was influenced by breeds of Portuguese origin such as the Curraleiro and Franqueiro. DNA studies have shown that there has been contamination of the breed through the use of bulls of the zebuine cattle breeds introduced to the Pantanal region during the twentieth century; influence of zebuine cows was excluded, as the mitochondrial DNA was found to be entirely taurine. The Pantaneiro was the principal breed of the Pantanal for several centuries. It is now considered to be at risk of extinction. In 2003 a population of less than 1000 was reported.  Characteristics  The Pantaneiro is a small breed; the coat is short, and brown or reddish-brown in colour, with a tendency to lighten on the back. It is well adapted to the extreme climatic conditions of the Pantanal region, which is characterised by high temperatures and periods both of flooding and high humidity, and of drought. The cattle are rustic and hardy, capable of surviving periods of food scarcity, and resistant to some diseases.

The song originally appeared on Struggle, an album of labor songs. It was re-released in 1998 on Hard Travelin', The Asch Recordings, Vol.3 and other albums. The song is about the death of striking copper miners and their families in Calumet, Michigan, on Christmas Eve, 1913, in what is commonly known as the Italian Hall disaster. Background and writing The victims of the 1913 massacre in rough caskets. Throughout the 1940s, Guthrie recorded hundreds of discs for Moses Asch, the founder of Folkways Records. One was “1913 Massacre”. According to Pete Seeger, Guthrie was inspired to write the song after reading about the Italian Hall disaster in We Are Many (1940), the autobiography of Ella Reeve Bloor, also known as Mother Bloor, a labor activist whose granddaughter was married to Hollywood actor and activist Will Geer who performed with Guthrie in the 1930s. Guthrie's notes indicate that he got the idea for the song \\"from the life of Mother Bloor\\", an eyewitness to the events at Italian Hall on Christmas Eve, 1913. A socialist and labor organizer from the East Coast, Bloor was in Calumet working on the miners' behalf with the Ladies Auxiliary of the Western Federation of Miners. She was assisted by Annie Clemenc, also known as \\"Big Annie of Calumet\\" – the \\"lady\\" in Guthrie's song who hollers \\"'there's no such a thing! / Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing.'\\" Bloor tells the story of the Calumet strike and the Italian Hall disaster in the first half of a chapter called \\"Massacre of the Innocents.\\" She devotes the second half of the chapter to events in Ludlow, Colorado in 1914, the subject of another Guthrie song — \\"Ludlow Massacre.\\" Guthrie's song echoes the language of Bloor's account in many places. The historian Arthur W. Thurner has found similar accounts in English and Finnish-language newspapers from the period; these accounts, he says, probably originated with Clemenc. (Many Finnish miners settled and worked in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, including Calumet.) There are conflicting stories about what happened that Christmas Eve and who yelled \\"fire\\" in Italian Hall. These conflicts may never be resolved. They are, according to Thurner, evidence of a \\"war between capital and labor\\" in the Copper Country in 1913. This war included a dispute about what transpired that Christmas Eve in Italian Hall. The debate over what the event means (or should mean) is ongoing. Guthrie's song counts as one of the more powerful —and certainly one of the best-known – interpretations of the tragedy. While \\"1913 Massacre\\" never became a folk standard, the song has been recorded and performed by many artists, including Guthrie's son Arlo; Ramblin' Jack Elliot; Scottish folksinger Alex Campbell; and Bob Dylan. Dylan performed \\"1913 Massacre\\" at Carnegie Chapter Hall in 1961. Dylan set his tribute to Guthrie —\\"Song To Woody\\" released in early 1962 — to the tune of \\"1913 Massacre.\\" right  Italian Hall disaster  The song revolves around a tragedy that took place on the evening of December 24, 1913, in Calumet's Italian Hall when more than five hundred striking miners and their families gathered for a Christmas party. The hall was on the second story and was reached by climbing a steep set of stairs. The only other exit was a poorly marked fire escape which could be reached by climbing out the windows. The trouble began when someone yelled \\"fire!\\". Even though there was no fire, people panicked and rushed toward the steep stairway which led to the street entrance. Seventy-three people were trampled to death, including fifty-nine children.  Cover versions and influences  In addition to those mentioned, other artists covering \\"1913 Massacre\\" include Cabin Sessions, Alex Campbell, Scarlett O' & Jürgen Ehle, Katie Else, Tim Grimm, Uncle Dave Huber, Enoch Kent, Alastair Moock, Lee Murdock, Joel Rafael, David Rovics, Jules Shear, and Sammy Walker. Dylan used the tune to \\"1913 Massacre\\" when he wrote \\"Song to Woody\\" which expressed \\"his debt to this great balladeer.\\" Guthrie's song also inspired the documentary film \\"1913 Massacre\\", released in 2011. More recently, both songs are central to a book released in June 2017, \\"Grown-Up Anger: The Connected Mysteries of Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, and the Calumet Massacre of 1913\\", by Daniel Wolff. Guthrie, meanwhile, might have drawn the melody for \\"1913 Massacre\\" from traditional folk songs including the English ballad, \\"To Hear The Nightingale Sing\\" (sometimes called \\"One Morning In May\\").

After closing in 1985 the theatre was shuttered and remained abandoned for 25 years. It was demolished October 2010. Original design The theatre, designed by Cajetan L. Dufort (full name Louis-Joseph Cajetan Dufort, also the architect of the Corona Theatre), was built in 1929 – just five years after the nearby Montreal Forum – in a then-bustling part of downtown Montreal. Its interior was designed by Emmanuel Briffa. The Seville was a single-screen, 1148-seat theatre and one of only 15 atmospheric theatres ever built in Canada.\\" Its interior had a Spanish theme (hence the name \\"Seville\\") with its ceiling painted to resemble a night sky with sparkling stars. There was an additional mechanism in place that could be turned on to give the appearance of clouds moving across the sky. The theatre was built with shops in the front, including an ice cream parlour on the east side and a drugstore on the west. In the 1940s the theatre became a live theatre, hosting a variety of performers including Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, The Four Aces, Peggy Lee, Sammy Davis, Jr., Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong. Redesign The Seville's interior was redesigned about 1950 by Oscar Glas using a pastel colour theme, and most of the original decorations were either discarded or sent to the monastery of St-Bernard-de-Lacolle. In the 1960s, the Seville reverted to showing movies once again. The Seville was home to The Sound of Music for a two-year run between 1965 and 1967. Then in 1978 the Seville was converted into a repertory theatre. After the theatre's owners claimed their rent was quadrupled in 1985, the theatre ceased operation. The last film to be shown was Stop Making Sense on October 31, 1985. Abandonment The structure declined rapidly. A series of developers showed interest in the site, but it is rumoured that the 1987 filming of Street Smart, starring Christopher Reeve was the beginning of the end of the Seville. During filming the production crew cut a hole in the Seville's screen in order to gain faster access to the dressing rooms located under the stage. The screen, which was one of the largest in the city at the time, was no longer viable for movie projection and since the screen would need to be replaced, the Seville was no longer viable as a repertory theatre.missed opportunities at the seville - Andy Riga In 1990, the building was declared an historic site by the city, protecting the exterior of the structure, but not the interior. Despite this, in 1994 a large chunk of the east wall collapsed onto the sidewalk, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the building. The hole contributed to the further deterioration of the Seville's interior. In 1997, local heritage activist Phyllis Lambert wrote a letter to the Montreal Gazette advocating for the theatre to be preserved and restored into a live venue. But in 1998, the interior of the building was gutted to make room for a two-story retail and office building. Despite a great deal of fanfare, including the presence of then-mayor Pierre Bourque at the announcement, plans for this redevelopment fell through. Demolition and redevelopment Le Seville condo project under construction, September 2011. The theatre's facade remained, albeit in poor shape, with hopes to fulfill requirements of its heritage designation. But no developer came through. The Seville's overall story is one of \\"demolition by neglect\\"; the building was not maintained over the years to the point where its most significant features no longer existed and preservation of the Seville's interior was an impossibility. It was to have been part of an \\"eco-friendly residential and commercial development,\\" but the project never materialized. In February 2009, it was announced complete demolition of the remains of the Seville will proceed, in order for redevelopment of the site as part of a $100-million real-estate project by Claridge Properties. However, the project did not move forward. In April 2010, following yet another intervention by Lambert, Claridge again promised that the project would proceed. The Seville and surrounding structures were demolished in the summer/fall of 2010 to make way for a 450-unit condo and commercial project called Le Seville. Construction of phases 1 and 2 has begun, with plans for construction to begin on phases 3a and b in 2012.

This can cover the rules of entry for visa applicants, foreign nationals or those seeking asylum at the border, detecting and apprehending those that have breached the border and removing them, or pursuing those in breach of immigration and criminal laws. United Kingdom United Kingdom immigration officers were previously employees of the UK Border Agency, and now work for Immigration Enforcement, a Home Office command, and are appointed by the Home Secretary, whose powers are conferred by the Immigration Act 1971 and who also act in accordance with Immigration Rules. The Immigration Rules are statutory instruments laid down by Parliament under Section 3(2) of the 1971 Act which governs the regulation of entry into the United Kingdom. The Rules are amended by Primary Legislation when required, and provide a framework to ensure that those that come to, or remain in, the UK do so legally, and those that do not can be removed. Immigration officers' powers over citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) and their family members are governed by the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. Immigration officers have the power of arrest and detention conferred on them by the Immigration Act 1971, when both at ports and inland. In practice, port immigration officers exercise powers under Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971 and inland immigration Officers under S28A-H of the Immigration Act 1971 and paragraph 17 of Schedule 2. This has led to separate training for port and inland officers, where port officers are not trained in Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). \\"Designated Immigration Officers\\" are port immigration officers who have been trained in detention under PACE. The archetypal power of arrest is for an immigration or nationality offence, which involves a person's entitlement to be in the UK.\\"What are immigration officers powers of stop & arrest\\" , \\"Immigration Media\\", 20 March 2015 Though immigration officers also have powers of arrest outside immigration and nationality offences under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Crime and Courts Act 2013, and under the Terrorism Act 2000 discussed below. Before the UKBA was established, British immigration officers were not uniformed, but they now wear a uniform with rank insignia. =At ports= An immigration officer at a port has the power to detain any person without arrest who is not a British citizen to investigate whether they qualify for entry to the United Kingdom under Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971.Immigration Act 1971(c. 77) Schedule 2 also gives an immigration officer the power to arrest without warrant anyone who is liable to detention.Para 17, Schedule 2, Immigration Act 1971(c. 77) The passing of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act created a provision for the Secretary of State to designate individuals as a \\"general customs official\\". Immigration officers who have received the appropriate training are designated as general customs officials and can carry out customs functions in additions to their immigration ones. The passing of the act supersedes the process where the Customs Commissioners would designate officers as customs officials. Designated Immigration Officers (DIOs) are designated by the Home Secretary, and only if they are fit and proper for the purpose, and suitably trained. Under Section 2 of the UK Borders Act, DIOs can detain any person without arrest in a port in England, Wales or Northern Ireland if they think that the individual may be liable to arrest by a constable for any offence under Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 or Article 26(1), (2) or (3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, or if there is a warrant for their arrest.Section 2, UK Borders Act 2007 (c. 30) They can be searched and detained using reasonable force for up to three hours, and can be pursued if they leave the port. If a DIO detains a person, they must arrange for a constable to attend as soon as is reasonably practicable. It is an offence to abscond, assault or obstruct a DIO exercising their powers under this section. However, Immigration Officers also have far broader powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 to examine, question, and search anyone in order to establish whether or not they appear to be or have been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. A person may be detained under Schedule 7 for up to 9 hours.Terrorism Act 2007.

Schedule 7, para 5(a) and para 18(2)(c) = Inland = Under Section 28A of the Immigration Act 1971, Immigration Officers have wide-ranging arrest powers. They can arrest: *non-British citizens if they are in the country illegally, or have remained beyond the conditions imposed on them *non-British citizens if, be means of deception, they obtain, or seek to obtain, entry or permission to remain in the UK. *any person who assists a breach of EU Immigration Law by a non-EU national. *any person who assists a breach asylum seekers for gain. *any person who assists a facilitate a breach of a deportation order in force against an individual who is a citizen of the European Union. *any person who obstructs an Immigration Officer or other person lawfully acting in the execution of the 1971 Act. *any person who has an immigration stamp or replica immigration stamp in their possession. *any person who **alters a registration card with intent to deceive or to enable another to deceive, **has a false or altered registration card in his possession without reasonable excuse, **uses or attempts to use a false registration card for a purpose for which a registration card is issued, **uses or attempts to use an altered registration card with intent to deceive, **makes or possess an article designed to be used in making a false registration card, **makes or possess an article designed to be used in altering a registration card with intent to deceive or to enable another to deceive.

The village is on the Indian National Highway 8, which leads to areas such as Ahwa via Waghai and Vansda, and to the hill station of Saputara. The population is mainly Muslim consistent with its establishment as a Muslim Surti Sunni Vohra settlement (hence the name \\"Ali\\") The main language spoken in Alipore is Gujarati, whilst English and Hindi can be understood by most. Establishment and origins Per folklore, there was a religious and devout Muslim named Ali who is believed to have migrated to Gujarat from Hadhramaut. Ali is believed to be a descendant of Muhammad. The land surrounding this village was open and mostly uninhabited. He found lush green land here and decided to live on an elevated piece of land. Gradually the ancestors of the now Aliporean Sunni Surti Vohra Community began to migrate, to this unnamed town, in search of spiritual guidance. Whenever people visited Ali's place they would say \\"Ali ne ta jawana\\" or \\"Ali wara gaam ma jaawana.\\" The people of the surrounding villages spoke mostly Gujarati; hence they would say \\"Ali por (gaam) jawaana\\". As people surrounded the religious leader, the place where he had his small tent was converted into a prayer area and later became a mosque. That is how the present day Jumma Mosque came in to existence. With an increasing population of Vohra moving to this part of the world, they began to build their houses near to the mosque. This migration formed a new settlement and they called their village Alipore. Location Alipore (pronounced Aalipore) is a village near Chikhli, of the district Navsari in the state of Gujarat in western India. It is approximately 130 miles away from the city of Mumbai, 17 miles from Navsari, 19 miles from Valsad and around 35 miles away from Surat. Population The population of 7500 is mainly Muslim, with Hindus forming the rest. The village has around 20 main streets (Mahollas) with many side-streets. The original population of the village are Muslim Vohras. The main language spoken in Alipore is Gujarati, whilst English and Hindi can be understood by most. Landmarks Alipore has some wonderful landmarks. There are at least five Mosques (for the Muslims), a Mandir (for the Hindus), a well equipped General Hospital, two Islamic learning centers i.e. Darul Uloom, Bank, Post Office and a Primary and Secondary High School. =Masjids= The Jumma Masjid (The Grand Mosque) The Laher Mohalla Masjid Gajaria Masjid, Khambia Masjid Pardar – located on the outskirts of the village. =Darul-Uloom= There are two Darul-Ulooms in Alipore, one in the heart of the village (Hidayatul Islam) and the other in Khambia. The former was established around half a century ago and has approx 200 students, and the latter was established around the mid 1980s. Both provide full boarding facilities. They both cater for Hafez classes as well the full Alim course. =Eidgah= Eidghah in Alipore provides an open designated space for Eid prayer. People from surrounding villages also benefit from this facility and often has several thousands people attending for the EID namaaz. Health care Alipore has a new large General Hospital located ideally on the Highway. The Alipore hospital is run by the Alipore Welfare Trust. It is a modern building built around 15 years ago and has just undergone further extension and now also incorporates conference facilities. It has many departments including a very busy A&E; along with state of the art CT scan facilities. It has excellent Dialysis facilities with 5 modern dialysis machines. There are also the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, Dental, Maternity, Orthopaedics and Paediatrics. It serves thousands of patients each year.

Education facilities The village presently has one primary school and a secondary school named K and B High School. The High school provide rolex watches education for around 885 students, up to the age of 17. A new High school is under construction and once completed will include science laboratories, a gym and ICT suite. Waterworks Alipore contains two main water works, one of which is situated in the centre of the village and the other in the Karolia Maholla. There is a further water purification plant using advanced filtration technique, which supplies clean water for both drinking and domestic use to every household in the village. Transport system Alipore has a good road system with access to a major highway in India. The National Highway 8, which passes through the middle of Alipore connects Delhi to Mumbai. It has recently been developed and expanded with the addition of a third lane. Public bus transport connects Alipore to surrounding towns and cities. There are numerous taxis and rickshaws to take one around the village. There are also future plans for a new express highway, which will run parallel to Alipore. =Railways= Alipore has at present a narrow gauge train service which operates from Billimora to Wagai. It has a railway station called Chikhli Road Station. Future plans include replacing the narrow gauge with the broad gauge and will extend its routes through Saputara (a well known holiday hill-top resort) to Nasik city. Cemeteries Alipore has 3 cemeteries, the main cemetery is located on the outskirts of Alipore adjoining the Dairy, it is well maintained through the hard work of the village youngsters. The other two smaller cemeteries are used occasionally. Vasudhara Dairy Alipore has a big dairy plant called Vasudhara Dairy, which is run by the milk co-operative society of Valsad, Navsari and Dang Districts. It employs over 1000 people, and produces over 300,000 litres of milk a day which is packaged in cartons. It also produces other dairy products such as butter and a variety of ice-creams. Crops The village is surrounded by acres of paddy fields, used for growing rice and sugarcane. Traditionally, the village survived on farming, producing rice as a main crop. Other products include cattle grass, cotton and mangoes, indeed Alipore has become famous for Alphonso and Kesar. Alipore was once well known for producing a handcrafted local cloth call Khadi, which was later replaced by electric hand looms that produced fine cotton cloth. The village's cotton industry diminished as its population began migrating to the UK in the early 1960s. Migration Aliporian migration to other countries has occurred since the 1880s. The first migrants went to South Africa entering through Mozambique of through the eastern shores at Durban and now largely settled in Johannesburg. After the end of the First World War and during India's fight for independence, The people of Alipore, mainly young, looked for opportunities elsewhere. Some went to Mumbai to seek jobs. In the 1950s, during the economic boom in the UK some migrated to the UK to work in the mills. Since then their descendants have played an integral part in their newly adopted countries. They now represent the social fabric of Britain and South Africa and have excelled in all spheres of life. As a result of migration the village currently is occupied by few to none of its \\"local\\" inhabitants.

Clotilde or Chlodechilidis (fl. 673) was the founder of the abbey of Bruyères-le-Châtel. Her charter is one of only eight known original manuscripts to survive from 7th century Francia, among which it is the only private charter. It is a parchment, which is unusual in that most surviving Merovingian documents of the 7th century were written on papyrus. As a result, it has been the object of detailed analysis over many years. Clotilde, notes Levillain, was evidently a very important woman. It is supposed that she was in some way related to the Merovingian kings, but the exact relation is uncertain. Her name and its variants, male and female, are common ones among the Merovingians, perhaps due to the memory of Clotilde wife of Clovis I. Clovis and Clotilde had a daughter of the same name. This Clotilde was unhappily married to the Visigothic king Amalric. King Guntram had a daughter named Clotilde, and Clotilde the Proud, daughter of King Charibert I, was a famously disobedient nun whose story is recounted by Gregory of Tours. Clotilde's charter also suggests a link to the Merovingians as it requires the nuns to pray for the stability of the kingdom and success for the king, a requirement found elsewhere only in royal charters. From the terms, derived from Roman law, which Clotilde uses to describe the lands she is granting to the nunnery, it appears that these had belonged to her son who had died without heirs. The term Deo devota used to describe her is read as meaning that Clotilde herself will become a nun in her new foundation. The vir inluster Charicard who is to have a life interest in Fontenay-lès-Briis is presumed to be Clotilde's husband for the legal terms used suggest that she was not a widow. The charter was first published in 1681 by Jean Mabillon in his De Re diplomatica. As the document long predates the general adoption of Anno Domini dating, there was initially a dispute over whether it belonged to the reign of King Chlothar II or King Chlothar III. Modern historians confidently date it to the sixteenth year of the reign of Chlothar III, from which the Anno Domini date of 673 is deduced. This dating had cast doubt on the authenticity of the charter as the reign of Chlothar III was presumed to have been only fifteen years prior to the 19th century. The content of the charter is simple. Clotilde grants a number of properties to the Virgin Mary and to the nunnery which she is founding. The nunnery is to be led by her niece Mummola. Half of an additional estate at Fontenay-lès-Briis is promised to the monastery after Clotilde and Charicard have both died. Clotilde sets out the rule that the nuns shall follow, based on that of Luxeuil, and how Mummola's successors shall be elected. She calls down the wrath of the Holy Trinity on any who oppose the provisions of her charter. The charter was issued at Lamorlaye, a Merovingian palace north of Paris. The date and location suggest that Clotilde chose to have the charter witnessed on an occasion when important persons were at Lamorlaye for other reasons, perhaps the annual muster and review of warriors, rather than having convoked the meeting herself. Ecclesiastical witnesses include the bishop of Paris Agilbert, abbot Chrodecar, a lawyer named Rigobert. One Ermenric, who signs immediately after Agilbert, and is thus the chief layman present, is tentatively identified with the man of the same name who had been intendant of the royal domain under Clovis II. Two counts who witness, Vaning and Robert, had been close allies of the mayor of the palace Ebroin. The following witness is named Ghislemar, probably the son of Waratton, another mayor of the palace.

Catering for around 360 boys and girls between the ages of 7 and 11, it is housed in the same building as its partner school, Hyde Park Infants.\\"Hyde Park Junior School\\", Ofsted, accessed 6 March 2008 The school's catchment area extends across part of the suburbs of Plymouth including Mutley and Mannamead.  History  Hyde Park School is built on the site where, in the 1590s, Thornhill House stood, which was occupied by Sir Francis Drake. Drake's Leat also ran past nearby. The school building was designed by Henry John Snell (1843–1924), who was responsible for a number of Plymouth's 19th century buildings. Hyde Park was the last school designed and built by the Plymouth School Board before the local authority took over responsibility for education in 1903, and it was officially opened by the Mayor of Plymouth on 27 May 1904. Upon opening the school had the capacity for 512 infants on the ground floor, 480 girls on the first floor and 430 boys on the third floor as well as two classrooms in the basement and a large playground with covered sheds. During the First World War, Hyde Park was used as a hospital and convalescent home. In the 1920s and 1930s, the school continued to run as three separate schools (infant, junior and high) and it was common for there to be 50 children in a class.Hyde Park Junior School On 20 March 1941, during the Plymouth Blitz, the school was severely damaged by enemy action. Accounts vary as to the cause of the damage: it may have been incendiary bombs, though an eyewitness account reported that a landmine carried by a parachute landed on the roof. The pitched roof was destroyed and has never been replaced: the building now has a flat roof. After the incident the children continued lessons in local church halls and also shared half-day sessions with other schools – the boys with Montpelier and the girls with Laira Green. Some children were evacuated with their teachers to Cornwall. In 1942, some returned to Hyde Park and a Nissen hut was erected in the front playground, it was used as a British Restaurant and then later as accommodation for the school. It was eventually dismantled in 1959. According to a short news item in The Times, the school was re-opened after the air raid damage by the Duke of Kent on 14 February 1942 as a social centre, the funds for which had been supplied by the British War Relief Society of America.. Online at The Times Digital Archive (subscription required). Beneath the school is a World War II air raid shelter which since the 1990s has been featured on local television and has been used to teach the children about the war.This is still open to the pupils for educational purposes when they study World War 2. In 1948, the school was visited by the Down Your Way radio program to interview the pupils about their \\"Paper for Salvage\\" scheme. By the early 1950s, the rebuilding of the school was complete. An inspection report from 1954 noted that there were nearly 1,250 on roll in the Junior and Infant school, and that the building was shared by the two schools. =21st century= The school logo In 2004, both the infants and the junior school celebrated the centenary. That year, it was said that Hyde Park had the largest population of ethnic minority pupils among primary schools in Plymouth. 2005 saw a modernisation of the school as broadband internet access was introduced, every classroom received an interactive whiteboard, and the old cloakroom was renovated into a new modern library. Headteacher Bernie Evans said the new location and modern feel of the room was intended to give reading status and the library a more prominent location. The old library was transformed into two smaller cloakrooms, accessible to years five and six. To assist road safety for their pupils, the school designed fashionable high-visibility jackets. Academic standards Following their June 2004 inspection, Ofsted wrote \\"This is a good school. It provides good value for money. Effective leadership and management and good teaching ensure that pupils achieve well. The school provides a very supportive community with a very positive ethos in which all pupils thrive.

Talking to Oswin and to other people he meets, either by chance or by design, Flood more and more gets the impression that Roger Colborn is a dangerous man who has something to hide, and that Jenny must be saved from the clutches of the Colborn family before it is too late. Thus, Flood's interest in the affairs of a now defunct company is fuelled by his desire to win back Jenny, so much so that his professional life is affected. Trying to dig up dirt on the Colborns, he is drawn into a quagmire of events he cannot make head or tail of and eventually misses an evening's performance without giving any notice. When, however, on the following day he finds his understudy--the man who saved his neck the previous night--dead in the streets of Brighton he realizes the seriousness of the situation. In the course of one week homes are broken into, evidence is stolen, several people die, family secrets are uncovered, and an inheritance is reclaimed.

One month before she eventually made her comeback in March 2007 her mother Carmen died, her second loss in her direct family since she won her Olympic medal. =Comeback= Her comeback to the international judo circuit was no success from the start. The death of her family members and her recent injuries still had a huge impact on her performances. Also due to these happenings her coach Jan de Rooij was no longer able to give her the aggression she needed to compete. National coach Marjolein van Unen took over from De Rooij in February 2008.

PAWS believes that the creation of a more peaceful society starts with the widening of mankind's circle of compassion which includes animals, thereby envisions a nation that respects animals, practices responsible pet ownership and protects wildlife. The volunteer-based organization rehabilitates these animals in the hope of finding them new homes and a second chance at a good life. PAWS does not take in pets of other people, but only victims of cruelty or neglect where the animal offenders are charged with violation of the Animal Welfare Act in court.  History  The Philippine Animal Welfare Society was founded in 1954 by Muriel Jay, a British educator who was then residing in the Philippines. She handpicked the first wave of members. Nita Hontiveros, one of the younger members then, recalls that the group would make stuffed toys and other items which the members would then sell to raise funds. Other activities included a clinic to provide services to injured animals. When Muriel Jay went back to England, PAWS became less active and eventually slipped into dormancy. In 1986, Nita Hontiveros-Lichauco, the current PAWS President, reorganized PAWS with a handful of volunteers composing of veterinarians, educators and people from other professions. They became the original board of Directors.  Programs and advocacies  PAWS is against the abuse of animals in any form. For years, the organization defended animals and reminded the people of animal rights by organizing different programs. Here are some of the organization's successful and on-going projects and programs: =The Animal Welfare Act of the Philippines and The Anti-Rabies Act= PAWS has been actively lobbying for better laws concerning animal welfare. RA 8485 – The Animal Welfare Act of the Philippines Since its reorganization in 1986, PAWS has been actively lobbying for the Republic Act 8485 or the Animal Welfare Act of the Philippines. However, the government was still not ready for it by that time. A revised Animal Welfare Bill was drawn up and diligently pursued by the organization in the Senate and in Congress. On February 11, 1998, the Animal Welfare Act of 1998 (also known as Republic Act 8485) was signed into law by then Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos. RA 9482 – The Anti-Rabies Act of 2007 After months of lobbying by DA, BAI, NMIS, vet groups and other animal welfare NGOs, the Anti-Rabies Act of 2007 or the Republic Act 9482 was signed into law by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on May 25, 2007. The program involves the mass vaccination of dogs, establishment of a central database system for registered and vaccinated dogs, impounding, field control and disposition of stray and unvaccinated dogs. It also calls for information and education campaign on the prevention and control of rabies, pre-exposure treatment of high-risk personnel and post-exposure treatment of animal bite victims, free routine immunization of schoolchildren aged 5 to 14 in areas where there is high incidence of rabies and encouragement of responsible pet ownership.GMA News.TV, \\"Arroyo Signs 2007 Anti-Rabies Act\\" =Aspin and Puspin= An Aspin is a mixed-breed dog in the Philippines, while Puspin is a mixed-breed cat. PAWS encourages the use of the term “Aspin” (Asong Pinoy) and “Puspin” (Pusang Pinoy) instead of “Askal” and “Pusakal”, because it showed that native dogs were just as cute, intelligent and as loyal as their purebred counterparts. Aspin and Puspin are now the politically correct term for native Filipino dog and cat breeds. The PAWS Aspin Club is a non-profit organization registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission composed of native or mixed-breed dogs and their owners who want Aspins to get proper recognition and treatment in the Philippines. PAWS started the Aspin Club to promote all animal advocates’ lifelong dream of promoting the beauty and dignity of our local breed. The club provides an opportunity for owners to socialize their Aspins through fun pet activities like dog walks, pet photography sessions, canine picnics, basic obedience lessons, and such. It also aims to promote the welfare of Aspins through education, lobbying and campaigns. =Dr. Dog program= Dr. Dog is an animal-assisted therapy program founded by Jill Robinson, MBE of Animals Asia Foundation. Dr. Dog is a program run by Animals Asia. PAWS is Animals Asia's Philippine coordinator. PAWS' Dr. Dog program brings loving therapy dogs to children's hospitals all over the Manila metro area. In 1997, \\"Pakko\\",a German Shepherd, was the first Dr. Dog. Dr. Dog provides comfort and emotional healing for disabled children, and educates the public about the value of animals in our society. In the Philippines, there are still people who still support the idea of killing and consuming dogs. PAWS hopes to change that by demonstrating how beneficial they are to humans. =Humane education= PAWS continues to work with Local Government Units in the Philippines in providing Humane Education and Responsible Pet Ownership Seminars to communities. PAWS also conduct different educational programs to promote Humane Education for students. These include school tours and visits; student interviews and lectures. PAWS Humane Education lectures include safety around animals, responsible pet ownership, animal welfare and rights, proper management of animal control facilities among other things. = Animal captivity = PAWS is opposed to the capture of all animals for commercial, entertainment and sporting purposes. PAWS is for the phase-out of zoos. On the argument that there is no longer any place for these animals to be released to and those zoos ‘protect’ these species, PAWS believes that more effort should go into the preservation of these animals’ habitat. In the interim, PAWS will work on the improvement of the condition of animals in zoos and constantly remind zoo owners that they have a responsibility to give every animal humane, professional care. =Dine with PAWS= PAWS’ annual charity dinner, Dine with PAWS, is held to help raise funds for the different programs and advocacies of the organization. The charity dinner showcases a “Doggy Buffet” where guests can bring their canine pals and enjoy sumptuous treats made especially for them. It is also the event where distinguished guests are inducted into the “Order of the Platinum Paws” for exemplary acts of selflessness in the promotion of animal welfare. Fight against animal cruelty =Dog Meat Trade= PAWS was responsible for a huge legal victory in the Northern Province of Benguet in April 2006. The province sought to take advantage of a loophole in the Animal Welfare Act of 1998, which allows the consumption of dog meat as a cultural and ritual practice, but not for commercial purposes. PAWS found out that Benguet's Dog Meat sprung not from\\"cultural practice\\" but that of just commercial purposes. After a massive world-wide letter campaign and with helps from other local animal welfare groups, the Benguet local government gave in. In May 2006, PAWS met with the National Meat Inspection Services, a division of the Philippine Department of Agriculture. Some of the main goals of the meeting were to close the loophole in the Animal Welfare Act of 1998, prevent circumvention in the law, and establish clear methods of enforcing the law. =Dog Fighting/Racing= PAWS opposes any acts whereby humans incite, allow, or cause animals to fight. Dog fighting, cockfighting, and bullfighting are examples of animal “blood-sports,” which glorify violence for the sake of monetary gain, entertainment, or other purposes. These activities cause suffering, maiming, and death to the animals forced to participate, and they have negative social consequences. While dog fighting and horse fighting are illegal under the Animal Welfare Act, cockfighting is legal and was one of the concessions that the organization had to give when they were lobbying for the law. PAWS continues to campaign actively against any form of animal fighting. PAWS opposes dog racing and is working against the entry of Greyhound racing in the Philippines. The profit-motivated industry of dog racing deprives dogs of normal social interaction, breeds and kills excessive numbers of dogs in the pursuit of faster animals, and forces dogs into a risky situation that often culminates in catastrophic injury. =Tambucho killing and euthanasia= The organization believes that euthanasia is sometimes unavoidable and is, under certain circumstances, an important service that is offered to animals. Euthanasia is the humane means of ending the suffering of an animal with an untreatable disease or one that is in physical distress. It is also used for animals that have severe behavioral problems that cannot be rehabilitated, including aggression since these animals cannot be adopted into a home because they pose a threat to the health and safety of people and other animals. PAWS recommends using the methods that cause a rapid loss of consciousness and that cause minimal pain, distress, and suffering in the animal. PAWS opposes any euthanasia methods or techniques that do not meet these humane principles. PAWS opposes “tambucho” gassing and electrocution as methods of euthanasia. =Animal cruelty cases= The Philippine Animal Welfare Society has monitored more than a hundred cases of animal cruelty in the country a year, many of which are ignored due to the lack of stiff penalties against animal abuse. The organization receives an average of 40 calls on cases of animal abuse daily.Inquirer News, Inquirer.net, \\"PAWS Gets About 40 Reports of Animal Abuse Daily\\" PAWS needs and encourages everyone to take action: report cases and/or file charges against people who committed animal cruelty. Volunteer lawyers are available to provide legal assistance to pet owners who cannot afford private lawyers or do not have enough information in filing cases. PAWS Animal Rehabilitation Center (PARC) Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) Animal Rehabilitation Center The Philippine Animal Welfare Society established the PAWS Animal Rehabilitation Center (PARC) as the first animal shelter with an active adoption and rehabilitation program in the Philippines. It aims to find new homes for the dogs and the cats through its adoption program. PARC's construction formally started in September 2000, with funding from the International Fund for Animal Welfare and assistance from Don Manolo Lopez of MERALCO. It had an informal operation in 2002. =Limited-Admission shelter= It is exclusively for animals in distress. An “animal in distress” is one that is suffering or is in imminent danger of losing its life. Not all animals in distress can be taken in at a given time due to the limited space & number of caretakers in the organization's shelter and due to its strict quarantine protocols. PAWS has never advertised its shelter as a \\"NO-KILL\\" shelter. The organization strives to provide the best care for shelter animals as far as the space, time and financial resources will permit and continue to work at prevention of abandonment largely through educational campaigns. =Adoption= PAWS puts its rescued animals up for adoption and screens all adoption applicants. PAWS strongly encourages responsible pet ownership and one of its campaigns is to remind people that a pet is a lifetime commitment. Adopting will give an orphan animal a second chance in life. It will also help rescue another animal by making space available at the shelter. Adoptable cats and dogs are already spayed or neutered; vaccinated and rehabilitated. Adopted animals may be brought back to the shelter to get free basic obedience training and avail of free veterinary consultations and discounts on PARC clinic services (all by appointment). =Fostering= This is an opportunity for anyone who wants animal companionship but may not be able to commit to a long-term ownership/guardianship. Foster homes are also sought for kittens, puppies or sick animals that need constant attention. There are over three hundred cats and dogs at the shelter at any given time; a certain percentage of which are sick or are too young to be able to survive on their own without constant loving supervision. =Clinic and veterinary services= Among its facilities, is a veterinary clinic equipped with tools and equipment needed to conduct examination, treatment and surgery. The clinic offers low-cost services and is open to the public and indigent pet owners on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays and Saturdays (T-Th-F-Sat) at 1:30 - 3:00 pm for consultations only. Spay/Neuter surgeries are done by appointment from 3:00 - 7:00 pm on the same days. PARC's volunteer veterinarian is Dr. Wilford Almoro, DVM. The clinic provides emergency veterinary treatments to all animals in distress. It also extends veterinary services to regular paying clientele, with strict adherence to standard veterinary fees. (In many instances PARC will refer clients to other private clinics) It gives all available information related to the medical needs of animals, as well as matters concerning their welfare. Spaying and neutering  PARC's veterinary clinic offers a low-cost spaying and neutering of dogs and cats to solve the problem of pet overpopulation. Sterilization (Spaying/Neutering) in dogs/cats is a routine surgical procedure wherein the testicles of males (neutering) and ovaries and uterus of females (spaying) are removed. A veterinarian does the procedure while the animal is under sedation and general anesthesia. Sterilization is a method of population control for pets and for stray dogs/cats, which are at least 6 months old. Sterilization itself is a fast and simple procedure that is commonly done. Volunteer opportunities The PAWS Volunteer Program is where people can share their talent and skills for the welfare of animals. Volunteers must be prepared to render at least eight (8) hours a month doing work at the shelter or outside the shelter for animal welfare to be in the active volunteer database. Volunteers can participate in the organization's campaigns, programs and other advocacies. =Canine Enrichment Team= Works in close coordination with volunteer trainers and senior volunteers or dog handlers with the task of making shelter dogs fit for adoption by socializing them and working on their behavioral problems like aggression, fear or shyness. Interested volunteers should have rabies pre- exposure shots and should undergo special training with the volunteer trainers and dog behaviorists. =Animal rescue, care and rehabilitation= Assists approved adopters, walk the dogs and/or puppies, socialize the cats/kittens, clean cages, help with feeding, bathing, medication and basic grooming as needed. After the eruption of Taal volcano in January 2020, volunteers of the group disaster team, together with the International Fund for Animal Welfare, organized relief operations at the evacuation center and found and fed abandoned pet dogs, cows and other livestock. They also sought donations of cow feed, chicken feed, dog food, cat food, and bottled water for these stranded animals. =Events, lobbying and legal campaigns= The team complements all the major projects of the organization with flyers, posters, endorsements, organizing rallies, etc. They represent PAWS in local events where the organization is actively participating, helps in manning event booths and selling merchandise. They help out in organizing events to raise funds for the shelter. =Humane education= See Humane Education PAWS gives presentations at schools regarding responsible pet ownership, pet handling and safety, overpopulation and endangered species.

The film was selected as the Dutch entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 65th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences This black comedy takes places in the 1960s, in a surreal Dutch new town consisting of only a single street. It is a darkly amusing satire of bourgeois life and its repressions, pursuit of fantasies through a Freudian forest are all executed with visual and dramatic flair. Van Warmerdam himself has said that he considers this his best film. It won him a (Gouden Kalf) for best director, and the movie was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award. Actor Rudolf Lucieer won a Gouden Kalf for his role as Anton, the forester. The movie is part of the official Canon of Dutch films Nederlands Film Festival: Canon van de Nederlandse film bekendgemaakt and has gained cult film status.BFI Plot A surreal black comedy set in a decrepit 1960's housing development. When Thomas' mother Martha is drawn into sainthood and changed their home into a shrine this frustrated his father the local butcher, Jacob and he finds it difficult to manage it all with his sexual needs. Thomas, 12-year-old son, becomes obsessed with events on the broadcast news - The liberation of the Belgian Congo is taking place and Thomas calls himself Lumumba, after the Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba. Thomas spends hours alone in the forest. It is there that he meets Agnes, a half-naked woman who lives in the forest and hides at the bottom of a pond and shows him how to breathe under water by sucking on a stem. He is encouraged in this escapism by Simon, the postman who reads all the mail and knows all of the bizarre and intimate secrets of the eccentric inhabitants of the town. Meanwhile, Anton a gun-crazed forester moves around the forest in search of trespassers. He is incapable of meeting his wife, Elisabeth's needs. Adding further complications are two Belgian priests who visit the town, bringing with them an exhibition of Africana and a Negro. Jacob turns into a cad and attacks women. Thomas has sexual confrontations with Agnes, but often disturbed by his mother's \\"divine\\" premonitions. Anton who is engaged in activities outside his family life, captures Simon red- handed in his act (looking at the school teacher's subscribed adult magazine) and tries to capture the Negro. Anton accidentally kills Agnes and hides the body under the pond. The Negro sees this and blinds Anton. Later Anton seeks the Negro to kill and finds him, but leaves him alone. Elizabeth knowing she is pregnant with Jacob's child leaves Anton, since he has turned asexual. Meanwhile, Martha's fasting has rendered her bedridden and the villagers pray at her window believing her to be a saint rather than a depressed woman. The church officiates Martha as a saint. Things go beyond Jacob can handle. Later blind Anton is found dead from the cold under a tree by the Negro. The Negro leaves the Town. Later through the news its heard Lumumba is murdered, which saddens Thomas. Simon comes back to the settlement housing unit as the official post-master, Thomas welcomes him wholeheartedly.

The Paparoa Stream flows from the east, through the settlement, and into the Paparoa Creek to the south, which joins the Arapaoa River which is part of the Kaipara Harbour. State Highway 12 passes through Paparoa. Matakohe is 6 km to the south west, and Maungaturoto is 12 km east. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"long flats\\" for Paparoa. History and culture =European settlement= Paparoa was one of several Kaipara settlements established by a religious group known as Albertlanders. Port Albert near Wellsford was the main settlement, and Matakohe was another. They settled at the Paparoa Block in 1863. The land was burnt off so that corn and grass could be planted. A road was constructed to the port at Pahi in 1865, and one to Matakohe shortly afterwards.Ryburn, pp 35-36 A pottery using local clay and a factory making rope and matting from flax operated in the 1870s, and brick and tile yards were established, but their business suffered from the poor roads and high freight charges. The nearest stores were in Pahi, to the south.Ryburn, pp 48-49, 60 The steamer Minnie Casey connected Paparoa with Helensville on the south side of the Kaipara with a weekly service from 1882, and the S.S. Ethel took over from 1891–95, after which services went only to Matakohe and Pahi.Ryburn, p 75, 79 The network of roads in the area were improved in the 1880s and 1890s.Ryburn, pp 89-92 =20th century= In the 1890s, Paparoa had 35 families and about 200 people, mostly living along the banks of the Paparoa River. Including Pahi, there were 400 people in the area. By 1906, the population of Paparoa had doubled.Ryburn, pp 54, 62, 64, 69 Pastoral farming became established in the area, and a dairy factory was opened in Paparoa in January 1895.Ryburn, p 64 A branch of a Helensville-based department store was operating in the town in the 1900s.Ryburn, p 70 The North Auckland railway line reached Huarau, to the east of Paparoa, in the early 1920s. A route through Paparoa was planned at one stage but this did not eventuate. The road to Maungaturoto, which passes through Huarau, was metalled in 1922.Ryburn, pp 184-185, 190 =Marae= The local Ōtamatea marae and its Aotearoa wharenui are a tribal meeting place for Ngāti Whātua and Te Uri o Hau.

He was the ninth Archbishop of Port- au-Prince, serving from 2008 until his death as a result of the 12 January 2010 earthquake. Biography Miot was born in Jérémie, Grand'Anse on 23 November 1946. He was ordained to the priesthood on 4 July 1975 in the Diocese of Jérémie. On 29 July 1997, he was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Port-au- Prince by Pope John Paul II, because the people had been displeased with Archbishop François-Wolff Ligondé's supposed encouragement of the coup movement -- the archdiocesan offices were burned in retribution. Archbishop Miot received his episcopal consecration on the following 12 October from Archbishop Christophe Pierre, with Archbishops François Gayot, SMM, and Ligondé serving as co-consecrators. During his tenure, he denounced the incarceration of Fr. Gérard Jean-Juste by the government of Prime Minister Gérard Latortue; Miot later suspended Father Jean-Juste after the priest disobeyed orders to not present himself as a political candidate. Miot succeeded Ligondé, becoming the ninth Archbishop of Port-au-Prince upon the latter's resignation on 1 March 2008. The Port-au-Prince Cathedral, archdiocese offices, and many other churches were destroyed by the earthquake on 12 January 2010. Miot was killed when the force of the quake threw him off his balcony at the papal nunciature. Archbishop Bernardito Auza, Apostolic Nuncio to Haiti, the Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese, said that he originally sought an immediate burial for Miot, but that it would have conflicted with local tradition. Miot was buried at Lilavois Cemetery on 23 January 2010 immediately after his funeral Mass. Celebrants presiding at the funeral Mass included Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York and Chairman of the board of Catholic Relief Services; Thomas Wenski, Bishop of Orlando; and Archbishop Bernardito Auza.

George D. Keathley, was a World War II United States cargo vessel that was used for troop transport and later converted to a survey vessel. She was laid down and launched as MS Alexander R. Niniger, Jr., then renamed MS Acorn Knot. She was put into US Army service as USAT Acorn Knot, then renamed USAT Sgt. George D. Keathley. She was transferred to the US Navy and became USNS Sgt. George D. Keathley (T-APC-117), but was later re- designated T-AGS-35. She was leased to the Republic of China, where she served as Chu Hwa (AGS-564). Both Nininger and Keathley were posthumous Medal of Honor recipients.  History  The ship, a C1-M-AV1 design, was built under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 2247), was laid down as Alexander R. Niniger, Jr., on 16 June 1944 by Walter Butler Shipbuilders Inc., Duluth, Minnesota; launched on 7 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. G.A. Meyer; renamed Acorn Knot in February 1945; and delivered to the War Shipping Administration on 30 March 1945. = United States service = Operated initially by Grace Lines in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, Acorn Knot was returned to the Maritime Commission and transferred to the Army Transportation Corps on 28 July 1946 and assigned to the Ryukyus Command as an inter-island cargo carrier. On 6 May 1948, she departed the Far East for California; and, in July, she entered the Moore Dry Dock Company's yard at Oakland for conversion to a cargo-troop-passenger ship. During the eight-month conversion, spaces for troop and cabin passenger accommodations and for hospital facilities were constructed. The work was completed in early March 1949; and, on the 15th, she was renamed USAT Sgt. George D. Keathley. On 19 April, Sgt. George D. Keathley sailed for Japan, where, in May, she resumed her Army Transportation Service on a schedule which included Japan, the Philippines, the Marianas, Okinawa, and Korea. When war broke out in the latter country in June 1950, Sgt. George D. Keathley was at Yokohama awaiting transfer to the Navy for service in the newly established Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). Within 24 hours of receipt of the news of the Communist crossing of the 38th parallel, she had taken on a full cargo of ammunition and a deck load of guns. On 27 June, she sailed for Sasebo, whence, with , she continued on to Pusan. On 1 July, she became the USNS Sgt. George D. Keathley (T-APC-117); and, on the fourth, her civil service crew got her underway back to Japan to take on Army Signal Corps units and their equipment and' transport them to Korea. With the completion of that run, the APC was assigned to shuttle service between Korea and Japan- evacuating hospital patients to Hakata and carrying troops and cargo to Pusan. In September, hospital ships took over that duty, and Sgt. George D. Keathley resumed cargo and troop operations out of Yokohama. During October, she carried cargo to the east coast of Korea, as far north as Hungnam. During November and early December, she carried troops and cargo to Inchon. Then, as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army added men and equipment to the Communist effort and pushed back down the peninsula, she assisted in the evacuation of that port-carrying Korean nationals to Pusan and cargo and ammunition back to Japan. From 6 January to 2 March 1951, the APC was at Yokohama for overhaul. She then resumed shuttle runs between Japan and Korea. With November, she commenced runs to Okinawa and Formosa; and, in September 1952, after more bunk spaces had been added to her troop quarters, she resumed a Japan-Korea schedule which was alternated with runs to Okinawa and Formosa until February 1953. From then until the signing of the truce in July, she operated primarily between Sasebo and Pusan, with only two runs to Naha and Keelung. After the Korean War, Sgt. George D. Keathley remained in the Far East and continued to be employed primarily between Sasebo and Pusan for another two years. In 1955, she was transferred to MSTS Atlantic; and, on 11 December 1956, she was placed out of service and transferred, temporarily, to the Hudson River Group of the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF). Ten months later, on 24 October 1957, her name was struck from the Navy list and her transfer to the NDRF was made permanent. In late 1966 Sgt. George D. Keathley was ordered activated. In November, she was towed to Norfolk, Virginia for conversion to a survey ship. On 1 December, she was reacquired by the Navy; assigned to MSTS; and given the designation T-AGS-35. In May 1967 the ship joined , which had been assigned during November 1966, to meet increased demand for gravity data, in gravity, magnetic and bathymetric surveys for military use under technical control of the Naval Oceanographic Office. The ship continued those surveys for the Oceanographer of the Navy until December 1971 when she returned to the United States for inactivation. Sgt. George D. Keathley was awarded nine campaign stars for her service during the Korean War. = Later service = On 29 March 1972, she was transferred, on lease, to the Republic of China, where she was named Chu Hwa (AGS-564). On 15 April 1976, she was struck from the US Naval Vessel Register. She was struck from the China Naval Register in August 1988 and returned to US custody. She was ultimately sunk as a target.

His courtesy title became Echizen-no-kami and also Sakon'e-no-shōjō Early in his tenure (from 1827) he ordered a five-year fiscal austerity plan in an attempt to rebuild the domain’s finances, and from 1829 he ordered that the domain’s retainers be reduced to half the present number over the next seven years. However, in stark contrast to these efforts, he maintained the luxurious lifestyle of his father and grandfather, and spared no expense when he rebuilt the palace within the grounds of Fukui Castle. The domain was also hit hard by increasing rice prices, and a major smallpox epidemic. Naritsugu also attempted to convince the Shōgun to allow him to trade territories with Hikone Domain under the control of the Ii clan; however, he died in 1835 at the domain’s Edo residence at the age of 25, possibly due to illness, before a decision was reached. This was one of the causes of the ill-will between the Tairō Ii Naosuke and future daimyō of Fukui, especially Matsudaira Shungaku. At the time of his death, Naritsugu had not yet produced an heir.

However, the financial situation of the domain remained dire, and conditions were not helped by his luxurious lifestyle and the need to rebuild the domain’s Edo residence after a fire. In 1822, the domain declared that indigo would become a domain monopoly. In 1817, he arranged for the marriage of his eldest son and heir, Matsudaira Naritsugu to a daughter of Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari. In 1818, the kokudaka of Fukui Domain was increased by 20,000 koku, bringing its total to 320,000 koku. He died in Edo in 1826. His graves are at the clan temple of Kaian-ji in Shinagawa Tokyo, and Unshō-ji in Fukui.

At the time, he was called by his youth name of Matsudaira Kogorō; however, in 1751 he underwent the genpuku ceremony and received a character from Tokugawa Ieshige's name to become Matsudaira Shigemasa. In 1755, his court rank was Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade and his courtesy title was Sakon'e-gon-shōjō and Echizen-no-kami. Due to his youth, he played little role in domain affairs, which were handled by his senior retainers. The tenryō territories previously administered by the domain reverted to direct shigunal control, resulting in a severe loss of revenue.

An internationally renowned bow maker, he is a 2012 MacArthur Fellow and a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres (2017).  Biography  =Early years= Rolland was born into a Parisian family of old descent. He received his early musical training at the age of four from his grandmother Germaine Thyssens-Valentin, a renowned concert pianist. During his childhood he frequented her musical salon, where composers such as Olivier Messiaen and other performers gathered. He began to play the violin at age eight and subsequently entered the Versailles conservatory and the Conservatoire de Paris, graduating at age 16. Among his professors were Alfred Loewenguth and Line Talluel. Aside from violin performance, his perfect pitch led to advancement in his ability to read and write music. He honed his skill for musical composition at the Schola Cantorum de Paris (1980–82) under Pierre Doury. In 1971, foregoing a promising career as a young soloist, he joined the historical bowmaking school of Mirecourt as a student of Bernard Ouchard. During these four years of intense training he developed the skills that were to make him become the youngest ever Meilleur Ouvrier de France \\"Best Artisan of France\\". =First studio= Rolland established his first studio in Paris, 34 rue de Laborde in 1976. In 1979, he was awarded the distinction of \\"Best artisan of France.\\" In 1983, he subsequently received the rare national title of Maitre Archetier d'Art. International awards followed. With the support of Étienne Vatelot, Rolland spearheaded the refinement of French Traditional Bowmaking. This merging of modernity and tradition elevated his craft to higher recognition, and he was soon commissioned to make bows for Lord Yehudi Menuhin, Arthur Grumiaux, Christian Ferras, Maurice Gendron, Joseph Suk, Leonid Kogan, Henryk Szeryng, Stéphane Grappelli and other leading musicians. At the time, his bows were already played by concertmasters and musicians in major orchestras throughout Europe, Asia and the United States. =Retreat and new directions= Rolland retreated to the Island of Bréhat in 1982. While there he researched new forms of bows and alternative materials, envisioning new advances in his art, as well as environmental awareness. This novel research on alternative materials for bows derived from his compound knowledge of music, bows and naval carbon/Kevlar technology. During this prominent stage of Rolland's career, a close dialogue with soloists was developing that would nourish his research on the sound qualities of bows in future years. Rolland then imposed his style, which expressed a profound knowledge of music as well as his understanding of the intrinsic qualities that gave fine French bows their world renown. While he continued creating traditional pernambuco bows, acquiring new clients such as Mstislav Rostropovich and Ivry Gitlis, Rolland broadened his reputation in Japan, where his creations were particularly sought. Since the beginning of his career, Rolland has been devoted to continuing the tradition, yet also committed to opening new avenues for it. Aware that his crafts rested on an endangered wood species, Pernambuco, thus far irreplaceable, between 1981 and 1986 he conceived the later trademarked Spiccato carbon fiber bow. =Innovation and entrepreneurship= Self-taught in science and new technologies, Rolland rationally combined his artistic knowledge and refined intuition. A visionary, he formulated and designed the first synthetic bow of concert quality, a bow still played today on stage by soloists. Rolland moved back to the mainland with his completed prototypes in order to launch the Spiccato bows carbon fiber manufacture in Vannes, Brittany. His revolutionary concept of an inner tension mechanism allows the musician to modify the camber of the bow at will and change its playing qualities even on stage. This was noted as one of the main innovative steps in the history of bow making. Within a few years, with the support of noted soloists (Yehudi Menuhin, Jaime Laredo, Ivry Gitlis, J.-P. Wallez, Heinrich Schiff, Christian Tetzlaff) his company attained international acclaim. In 1994, the bow that Jean-Luc Ponty called \\"the 21st century bow\\" was awarded Musicora First International Prize. This contributed to a new dynamic of innovation in musical instrument and bow making far beyond the work of Rolland himself: in less than ten years, hundreds of manufactures of carbon bows were appearing around the world. In 2012 Rolland introduced a significant innovation in the design of the bow with the Galliane frog. Galliane frogs give a slight helicoidal shape to the bow hair, allowing the performer to play with a fuller hair ribbon from frog to tip. In 2016 Rolland evolved the orchestra conducting baton, creating a new shape that transformed the conventional bulb of the baton. The ergonomic design, based on a 3-D imprint of the conductor hand, combines physiology and musical purpose. =Bow as artwork= In 1999-2000 Rolland stepped back from active entrepreneurship in order to create a curriculum for the first bow making school in the United States. Following these intense years, he permanently settled in the United States in 2003, where he made his home and studio, in Boston, Massachusetts. Rolland now concentrates on making wood bows as individual art pieces, and has been commissioned by artists such as Anne- Sophie Mutter, Yo Yo Ma, Miriam Fried, Christian Tetzlaff, Lynn Harrell, Kim Kashkashian, and Julia Fischer. This new phase of his career reflects an understanding of the bow making process as unifying fine artisanship and musical knowledge. It was noted as a Contemporary Art form by the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston and presented in 2005 in a program of its Contemporary Art Department. Rolland invests much time in historical and scientific research, writes about bow making and gives public lectures. His bows were featured in an exhibition, The Violin in America: Old World Tradition, New World Sound, at the Museum of Making Music, Carlsbad, California, in 2008. Reputation Rolland, whom Ron Fletcher (The Boston Globe, 2005) called \\"one of the world's greatest bow makers\\" and \\"The Lord of the Strings\\", has created with his hands about 1,500 wood bows in the first 35 years of his career. These bows are played today around the world as Rolland continues his work. Most of the major soloists of the past three decades, at some point in their career, have acquired a bow, sometimes several, made by Rolland. In his 2018 recording of the J. S. Bach Suites for Cello, Yo Yo Ma used a Rolland bow, in his words a \\"magic bow\\". Rolland bows, that Menuhin once deemed \\"A gift for the violinists\\", are featured in private collections in Europe, the US and Japan. Rolland participates in foundational programs helping young musicians (Zino Francescatti competition, the Peabody Institute, Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation). In 2016 he donated bow #1515 to Community Music Works, a nonprofit that brings string music to young people in disadvantaged communities. Rolland is a long-time contributor to \\"Music for Food\\", a Boston initiative to fight hunger in our communities. He is called on as a judge for international bow making competitions, gives lectures in music schools (Curtis Institute, Longy School of Music, etc.) and he contributes to the magazine The Strad. Rolland has trained about 20 apprentices so far, and conceived the curriculum for the first bowmaking school in America. Benoît Rolland is a registered trademark.

Alan has been playing professionally since the 1970s and has performed with a variety of Blues legends that include Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, Albert Collins, Albert King, The Fabulous Thunderbirds (1980's version with Jimmie Vaughan), Robert Cray, Bonnie Raitt, John Lee Hooker, and Otis Rush among others. He now resides in Austin, Texas and plays locally in and around Texas' major cities, especially Houston (where he performs nearly every month), occasionally in Dallas and Fort Worth, and also Europe, where he has a large following in Scandinavian countries, Germany, Denmark and Israel.  Life and career  = Early life = Alan Haynes in Aarhus, Denmark 2014 Haynes started playing guitar at the age of 8 and approached the blues for the first time when he was about 12. Among the first influences he had were the Three Kings of the Blues: BB King, Freddie King, and Albert King, as well as fellow Houston native Albert Collins. By the age of 16 Alan decided to dedicate himself to the blues. = Adult life and career = In the late 1970s Alan joined the Texas Boogie Band as a second guitarist but eventually became the main guitarist. Alan moved to Austin, TX in the early 1980s. While playing with the Texas Boogie Band, Haynes got to open and share the stage with legendary Blues artists such as Muddy Waters. Alan and the Texas Boogie Band were, by that time, the house band at the Texas Opry House, also getting radio broadcasting in Houston (on 101KLOL). Alan would later lead his own band, \\"Alan Haynes and the Stepchildren\\" and release his first EP, \\"Seventh Son\\" in 1984 under the Orphan label. Stepchildren included legendary Blues-Rock drummer Uncle John Turner, who had played with the likes of Johnny Winter during the late 1960s and early 1970s and recorded milestone Blues albums. Alan was inducted into the \\"Buddy magazine Texas Tornado List\\" in 1980 and his band was voted \\"Best Blues Band\\" by the \\"Music City Austin - Music Poll\\" in 1985. Later on, for about six years in the 1990s, Alan was the house band at Antone's \\"home of the Blues.\\" During those years, in 1994, Alan released his second studio album, Wishing Well. This time he had life friends and former Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble rhythm sections Chris Layton on drums, Tommy Shannon on bass, and Reese Wynans on keyboards. Alan also counted on Preston Hubbard from the Fabulous Thunderbirds and George Rains (Jimmie Vaughan's drummer) for this album. The result was earned Haynes a featured article in the \\"Guitar Player\\" magazine in August 1995. Alan would later continue playing locally and in Europe and would record two more albums on his own, but this time capturing the emotions of live performances. These two, \\"Live at the Blue Cat Blues\\" recorded in Dallas in 1998 with Jim Suhler and \\"Live at the Big Easy\\" recorded in Houston in 2001 would result in Haynes' last works to date.  Style & technique  Haynes' style is a soulful mix of Texas blues that includes musical ideas from different genres, essentially jazz and southern country. Haynes' tone is relatively clean and very clear as he uses no effects between his guitars and amps. The use of different dynamics and long, intense jams after singing a few verses has been a constant throughout Alan's career. His versatility and variety as a musician and guitar player are easily recognized as he mixes jazz chords with country licks while playing blues progressions. Haynes is also well known for being a master of slide guitar and usually plays a few tunes with the slide in his regular sets. Haynes' playing style is also denoted by precision on his bends, a wide range and variety of licks and tight rhythms that he achieves through complex chord-arrangements. Another component of his playing is his heavy and masterful use of his fingers to play (instead of a pick, which he also uses) and several pickup switches while playing licks and chords that allows him to achieve different sounds.  Musical influences  Haynes' main influence is Johnny Winter, who he was introduced to at the age of 15 by fellow Houstonian, Benny Valerio. This influence is evident in both his fluent and aggressive playing and growling vocals which he tends to harmonize with his guitar. Albert Collins is another big influence that can be traced on Alan's huge bends and vibratos as well as his fresh tone. Other Blues legends that have tremendously influenced his career and style are Albert King, Muddy Watters, Freddie King, BB King, T-Bone Walker, and Lightnin' Hopkins, among others. Alan has shared the stage or toured with many of these legends and has covered and recorded several covers from them. Many of those songs are still part of Haynes repertory when playing locally and abroad.  Equipment  Alan's sound is characterized by a warm tone achieved by playing vintage Strats through vintage Fender amps. His main guitar is a 1960 Fender Stratocaster with a C-Profile rosewood fret board and Dakota Red body. It was previously owned by Stevie Ray Vaughan and prior to Stevie, it belonged to Eric Johnson. The guitar has also been played by Billy Gibbons, Carlos Santana and Johnny Winter. Pickups on this guitar are stock and therefore have a vintage sound. His favorite amp setup includes a Fender Vibroking and an Ibanez Tube Screamer Mini. Previously a heavy strings user (11's and 12's), Haynes now employs any 10-46 set of strings and prefers standard tuning.

This film is produced by Fred Wolf Films. The title character was voiced by Burgess Meredith. The doctors were voiced by Frank Nelson, Regis Cordic, and Charles Woolf. The special first aired October 30, 1978 on CBS. The special was followed by two sequels: Puff the Magic Dragon in the Land of the Living Lies (1979) and Puff and the Incredible Mr. Nobody (1982). Plot The film begins with Puff's narration about a little boy named Jackie Draper, who is filled with so much self-doubt and fear that he has stopped talking altogether. His parents are so concerned that they have three doctors examine him, and they say it is hopeless and that little Jackie will never talk again. Jackie returns to his room, where he sits until Puff comes to his bedroom window and starts a conversation with him. Puff invites himself in, talks to Jackie about inner happiness, and pulls a long sheet of paper out of a magic bag. He cuts the paper into a paper doll shaped like Jackie and dubs it Jackie Paper. He explains that Jackie Paper can do anything and then asks if he can put his happiness into it. After he does so, the paper doll version of Jackie comes to life, and Puff then begins to make plans to go to Honalee, which is located by the sea. Jackie admits he is afraid. Puff then helps Jackie make a boat using things in Jackie's room, such as string, sealing wax, and the frame of his bed. They set out onto the ocean, where they meet a boat filled with kings and princes in the shape of cards. Afterward Jackie says he was afraid of pirates after hearing about them. They then run into Very Long, a giant pirate who takes them to his island. While they await their fate, Puff says that Very Long will not be scary if they get to know him. They then view his inner desire with Puff's magic smoke rings which have the power to reveal hidden things. It reveals that Very Long secretly wishes to be a baker. Jackie then goes and asks Very Long if he can make pies, which Jackie doubts Long could. After baking dozens of pies, Very Long expresses that he always wanted to be a baker, but never believed he could do it and was afraid he could not change from being a pirate. Jackie prompts him to make this change, and Very Long expresses his gratitude to Jackie and Puff. They continue their journey until they reach the starless sky, where jealous clouds block out the brightness of the stars. One of the stars falls, and Puff instructs Jackie to take the small star to the sky with the boat, which Puff gives butterfly wings. In order for the ship to fly, Puff has to get out of the boat, leaving Jackie alone to face his fears. Jackie then returns the star to the sky, brightening the sky. Puff rewards Jackie with a medal for bravery. Eventually they reach Honalee, which, instead of a paradise, turns out to be a gloomy place. This is revealed to be the work of living sneezes that out of depression made the place gloomy to fit their mood. Puff then orders Jackie to leave, as this is no place for him. After that Puff sadly walks to his cave, realizing he was not brave enough to defeat the sneezes. He is then reunited with Jackie, who returns with Very Long and his chicken soup to cure the living sneezes of their colds, making them happy. They then return Honalee to its happy glory by singing. Once this is done, Puff and Jackie go back to Jackie's room and return Jackie to his body. Puff tells Jackie that thanks to his creativity he is now a brave boy and leaves, saying he will return to visit. Jackie's parents come into the room to find Jackie happy and talking again. They then hug Jackie and express their love for him. The film ends with Puff asking the audience if they just saw a dragon walk by, similar to what he asked Jackie at the beginning of the story.

He made his profession as a member of that Roman Catholic religious institute on August 2, 1963, and then furthered his studies in philosophy and theology at Rome. Paulo was ordained to the priesthood on July 4, 1969, and did pastoral work following his return to Haiti. In 1976, he was assigned to the formation of future missionaries, serving as a novice master and superior of the scholasticate. Paulo was later named President of the Conference of Religious in Haiti and provincial superior of his religious institute in Haiti. In the latter office, he undertook missionary work in Colombia as well. On July 7, 2001, Paulo was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Port-de-Paix by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 14 from Archbishop François Gayot, SMM, with Archbishops Hubert Constant, OMI, and Bishop François Colímon, SMM, serving as co-consecrators. Paulo succeeded Colímon as Bishop of Port-de-Paix upon the latter's resignation on March 1, 2008. He is the first member of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate to hold that post.

He brought the Guang Ping Yang t'ai chi ch'uan to the United States. History Kuo Lien Ying's father was a silk merchant, and the family was independently wealthy. As a youngster, Kuo reportedly had no interest in an academic education, wanting only to learn the fighting arts. In 1907, at the age of 12, Kuo started training in Northern Style Shaolin Kung-Fu, studying for five years with Master Li Lin, who was especially skilled in Chang Chuan (Long Fist). Kuo became proficient at this martial arts system, which was originally developed by Buddhist monks in China. His pushing hands training partner in Taiwan was Tchoung Ta-tchen. At 23, Kuo became one of only four inner-door disciples of Wang Jiao-Yu, himself one of only two inner-door students of Yang Pan-hou. Yang Pan-hou was the son of the originator of what has become known as Guang Ping Yang t'ai chi ch'uan: Yang Luchan born Kuang-p'ing (Guangping) and known as the founder of Yang-style tai chi chuan. After completing \\"Chin to Toe\\" in 100 days Kuo was taught the Guang Ping Yang t'ai chi ch'uan from the 100-year- old master Wang Jiao-Yu. Kuo, at age 28, studied Xingyiquan for two years with Master Huang Gin Yin, a highly skilled student of Guo Yunshen, himself the teacher of Wang Xiangzhai, who was reputed to be the best Xingyiquan fighter of his time. Kuo also studied Baguazhang with Chang Hsin Zhai and Chung Ting Hua. =Early career= Kuo Lien Ying reportedly was a bodyguard for a while on the gold caravans through China, protecting the caravans on horseback with his unrivaled rope-dart techniques. He allegedly became a governor of a province in China, and later a general in the army of Chiang Kai-shek. In 1947, after the Communist takeover, he fled to Taiwan, became a congressman and opened up a martial arts school. Although he left his four wives and eight children in China when he fled Mao Zedong, Kuo wooed and married the 21-year- old sister of one of his students, Ein Simmone Kuo. Kuo was so confident of his fighting skills that in 1951 he issued a challenge to world boxing champion Joe Louis, to meet him for a fight. In 1972 Kuo claimed to the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"I could have thrown him.\\" 1 =Kuo Lien Ying in America= In 1965, he immigrated to the United States and settled in San Francisco's Chinatown, leaving his young wife behind in Taiwan. At the request of his first U.S. student, David Chin, Kuo began teaching a few students on the roof of a local hotel. After less than a year, Kuo returned to Taiwan to bring Simmone Kuo to San Francisco. While he was in Taiwan, his students in San Francisco located an empty storefront at 11 Brenham Place, an alley which faced Portsmouth Square Park, which was unfortunately adjacent to a funeral parlor. The empty storefront was available due to the superstitions of the local residents who did not want to inhabit a place next to a mortuary. But according to one of his later students, Henry Look, Kuo often told him, \\"Don’t worry about dead people, worry about live ones.\\" The students converted the storefront into a martial arts studio, with living quarters in the rear. Kuo named his new school, \\"Lien-Ying Tai-Chi Chuan Martial Arts Academy\\". In 1967 Kuo and Simmone had a son, Chung Mei Kuo. Chung Mei was trained in the Shaolin Kung Fu and T'ai chi ch'uan styles at an early age, achieving Chin-to-Toe at 18 months. Kuo was one of the major theorists of the Chin school, which offers the closest blend of the hard and soft styles. Chin stylists claim there is a 50-50 blend of the two because while you are yielding, you are most conscious of unyielding and that is the only way you can take advantage of all things. =T'ai chi ch'uan lineage tree with Yang-style focus= Portsmouth Square, Chinatown Grandmaster Kuo Lien Ying, photo by Rubbo Reportedly, one of the stories that Kuo told his students was about the time he was walking in a Chinatown alley late one evening and was set upon by a group of robbers. Kuo reached down and picked up a piece of metal lying on the ground and with his bare hands pounded the spike into the brick wall of the nearest building, and then hung his jacket on the spike. The would-be robbers fled. With an uncanny sixth sense, Kuo knew when his students would sleep in, missing the 5 a.m. practice session, and he would call them up, shouting in Chinese into the telephone, \\"Lela, lela, t'ai chi, t'ai chi!\\" (\\"Practice, practice, t'ai chi, t'ai chi!\\") Kuo Lien Ying was among the first Chinese martial arts masters in America to teach Asian fighting arts to American students, and was often admonished by other Chinese teachers to not teach to Westerners. In 1975 Sam Peckinpah filmed part of The Killer Elite in Portsmouth Square, and hired Kuo Lien Ying and many of his students for the scenes of a martial arts school in San Francisco. Kuo and his students gave many demonstrations of T'ai chi ch'uan and Shaolin Kung-Fu at many locations, including schools and banks. In 1983, Kuo returned to Mongolia, and died in 1984. Followers Simmone Kuo, Kuo's widow and student, continues to teach privately at the Lien-Ying Tai-Chi Chuan Martial Arts Academy in San Francisco Chinatown (15A Walter U Lum Place, above the produce market) after retiring in 2016 from physical education teaching duties at San Francisco State University. The founder of World Tai Chi and Qigong Day, Bill Douglas, carries on the form under the name Kuang Ping Yang Tai Chi Chuan, as passed down from Kuo Lien Ying to Gilles Messenger to Colin Berg, Anne Beier and Jennifer Booth, Bill's teacher. Guang Ping Yang Tai Chi Association The Guang Ping Yang Tai Chi Association was formed in 1997 to honor the memory of Sifu Kuo Lien Ying and in commemoration of his unselfish sharing of his many skills. The mission of the Association is to promote, perpetuate, develop interest in, and preserve the quality of Guang Ping Yang style t'ai chi ch'uan throughout the world, and to provide support for research and education in Guang Ping Yang t'ai chi ch'uan. *Honorary Chairmen: Y.C.

His most notable discovery was his 1952 work with Milton S. Livingston and Hartland Snyder on the Strong focusing principle, a critical step in the development of modern particle accelerators like the synchrotron, though this work was preceded by that of Nicholas Christofilos. Courant was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and remained active as a distinguished scientist emeritus at Brookhaven National Laboratory. He played a part in the work of Brookhaven for sixty years and had also been mentor to several generations of students. In this kind of generative academic influence, he can be compared to his father, the mathematician Richard Courant. He turned 100 in March 2020 and died the following month. Early life Courant was born March 26, 1920 in Göttingen, Germany, the first of four children of Richard Courant and Nerina Runge Courant, a year after their marriage.\\"Richard Courant.\\" World of Mathematics. Online. Thomson Gale, 2006. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2008. He wrote that he \\"came by science naturally\\". His mother's father, Carl Runge, is credited with the Runge-Kutta method for numerical solutions of differential equations. A maternal great-grandfather (Runge's father-in-law ) was Emil DuBois-Reymond, a pioneer in electrophysiology. Affinity for science and mathematics extended further than his biological family. Ernest Courant's childhood neighbors included the mathematician David Hilbert (his father's thesis director, in whose honor Ernest received the middle name of David) and the physicists Max Born and James Franck. Further, his father's students and colleagues became friends of the family, and often visited. Ernest's early interests centered on chemistry. \\"I had a lab at home full of test tubes, Bunsen burners, and chemicals. Once there was a small fire (easily put out), but I got a sense of how things were put together.\\" Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, and the neighborhood and its intellectual society were disrupted-- along with the mathematics department at the University. Ernest's father had been born to a Jewish family of small businessmen, and he was now identified as a Jew, and an undesirable, by the new regime.\\"Richard Courant\\" biography at the University of St. Andrews. Expelled from his position at the University of Göttingen, Richard Courant took a temporary teaching position in England, and the family abandoned Göttingen in favor of Cambridge for a few months. Forewarned by a Nazi acquaintance that the anti-Semitic storm would not settle but intensify, the family made plans to emigrate permanently. They returned only briefly to Germany before embarking to New York City, where his father had secured a post at New York University--and immigration visas to the US. Ernest became an American citizen in 1940. Fluent in English from both early lessons and the recent period enrolled at the Perse School in Cambridge, Ernest was accepted at the Fieldston School of the School for Ethical Culture, with a scholarship, thanks to intervention by family friend (and Fieldston alumnus), J. Robert Oppenheimer. Career Courant graduated from the Fieldston School in 1936, received a physics degree from Swarthmore College, and earned a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Rochester in 1943. Courant worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1948, first as an associate scientist in the Proton Synchrotron Division. He received tenure in 1955, and was promoted to senior scientist in 1960. In addition, he taught as an Adjunct Professor at Stony Brook University from 1966 to 1986.Former Faculty Homepage . =Honors= * 2007 University of Rochester distinguished scholar award * 1987 First Annual Robert R.

MVC fracture surface morphologies for a) tension, b) shear, and c) bending failures Fracture process MVC proceeds in three stages: nucleation, growth, and coalescence of microvoids. The nucleation of microvoids can be caused by particle cracking or interfacial failure between precipitate particles and the matrix. Additionally, microvoids often form at grain boundaries or inclusions within the material. Microvoids grow during plastic flow of the matrix, and microvoids coalesce when adjacent microvoids link together or the material between microvoids experiences necking.

Shear stresses will result elongated dimples, which are parabolic depressions that coalesce in planes of maximum shear stress. The depressions point back to the crack origin, and shear influenced failure will produce depressions that point in opposite directions on opposing fracture surfaces. Combined tension and bending will also produce the elongated dimple morphology, but the directions of the depressions will be in the same direction on both fracture surfaces.

In 2007 he published his memoir, Comes the Peace: My Journey to Forgiveness (with Clare Ansberry; Free Press, 2007). Meston was taken to Nepal at the age of 3 after his mother was drawn there for religious reasons. After being ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun by Lama Thubten Yeshe his mother placed Meston as a foster child with a Tibetan family, and at the age of 6, he was given to the care of Kopan Monastery as a novice monk. Gradually his nun-mother became a source of confusion and embarrassment because her infrequent visits to the monastery drew unwanted attention to the lone, white boy monk. Meston remembered his time in the monastery as a terrible experience--partly because he was a white outsider and also because young monks were treated and fed so poorly. He was expelled as a teenager for violating the vow of celibacy, and-- despite being culturally Tibetan and unable to speak much English--he was sent \\"home,\\" first to Italy and then to California, where he lived with his unknown step-grandmother (a former bullfighter). He eventually made his way to Boston where he enrolled at Brandeis University and graduated in 1996.

In 1924, a bond issue was approved by voters in the amount of $35,300,00 to build systems that would store and conserve water including eight dams - Thompson Creek, Big Dalton, San Gabriel, Big Santa Anita, Eaton Canyon, Big Tujunga, Pacoima, Puddingstone, and Sierra Madre. Dam The concrete arch dam has a height of , and a width of . Construction was completed in 1928. It is owned by Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. At the lower face of the dam, water can be released out of a steel grille covered diameter outlet onto a spillway, and then into channelized Little Santa Anita Creek. In the 1940s CCC—Civilian Conservation Corps workers built the concrete channel containing the creek, from the dam through adjacent Sierra Madre. They also constructed public street bridges and footbridges across the channel in the Sierra Madre Canyon neighborhood.Living New Deal Blog: \\"Sierra Madre Channel and Bridges, in Sierra Madre\\" . accessed 7.14.2014 Reservoir—debris basin The dam's debris basin, when unfilled with sediment and a small reservoir, can have a storage capacity of , and a normal surface area of 1 acre.

Little Santa Anita Creek is a tributary of Santa Anita Creek, which is a tributary of the Rio Hondo at their confluence in Whittier Narrows. The Rio Hondo is a major tributary of the Los Angeles River. The dam and debris basin—reservoir are used for flood and sediment control, and for downstream fish habitat protection. Access Access to the dam is restricted by locked gates and chain link fencing across the public Sierra Madre Canyon neighborhood side. To the west, on Mount Wilson Trail Road in the neighborhood, there is a trailhead for the historic Mount Wilson Trail, a hiking trail that climbs up through Little Santa Anita Canyon to reach Mount Wilson.SummitPost.org: Little Santa Anita Canyon and the Mount Wilson Trail — with photographs.The Far Side of the Sky Blog: \\"History of the Mount Wilson Trail\\" Adventure Hikes and Canyoneering in the San Gabriels Blog: \\"Hike D14.

It was designed to support large, complex projects, written in any number of programming languages, primarily C/C++. Qbs is an all-in-one tool that generates a build graph from a high- level project description (like its predecessor qmake), and additionally undertakes the task of executing the commands in the low-level build graph (like make). Qbs was originally created by Nokia, then The Qt Company, who distributes it along with their Qt toolkit. It integrates with the Qt framework, and automates the creation of moc (meta object compiler) and rcc (resource compiler) sources, which are used in Qt's meta-object system and in the integration of binary resources (e.g. pictures). Features Qbs is unique in that it has no mechanism for in-source builds, guaranteeing the ability to create several builds from a single source tree, including building them from a single command invocation and in parallel. This is a key feature, ensuring that source files remain unaffected if a build directory is removed and that no output artifacts are written into the source directory. Qbs has no built-in support for any particular programming language, toolkit, or library. This is again in contrast to qmake, which hardcodes support for many Qt- related tools and workflows. Instead, Qbs is provided with a set of modules written in a QML dialect and JavaScript that enable support for a variety of programming languages and tools. Qbs currently provides modules supporting the Android SDK and NDK, C, C++, Java, NSIS, TypeScript, WiX, Xcode, and a variety of other tools. Qbs can build projects for many platforms including Android, FreeBSD, iOS, Linux, macOS, QNX, tvOS, watchOS, and Windows, with support for Universal Windows Platform applications, INTEGRITY, VxWorks, and other platforms under development. Qt Creator provides built-in Qbs support, and IDE integration for Visual Studio is provided by the generators feature. Support for Xcode is currently under development. Build process The build process in Qbs takes place in two stages. First, the build graph is resolved by reading the project's configuration files and computing the set of input and output nodes and the dependencies between them in a directed acyclic graph. Then the executor executes all of the commands necessary to create the output files, in parallel according to the dependency rules. Each build project contains a single build graph (*.bg) file in the directory where Qbs stores the serialized representation of its internal build graph format. Deserializing this file and utilizing the cached information allows Qbs to very quickly resolve the project, leading to near-instant incremental builds. Deleting the build graph file causes a complete (clean) rebuild of the entire project. In contrast to make, Qbs does not rely on timestamps of files in the build directory, and tampering with its contents will not lead to targets being rebuilt unless the—check-outputs option is used. This is done for performance reasons because on some platforms (e.g. Windows), reading timestamps from the filesystem is very slow compared to reading them from the build graph file. Example Qbs file CppApplication { name: \\"helloworld\\" files: \\"main.cpp\\" } History Qbs development began at Nokia in the year 2010 in response to the need for a replacement for qmake. Qbs' design aims to provide a much lower learning curve, better integration with IDEs, and a stable and powerful language with predictable behavior. Qbs 1.0 was released in 2013 and further developed by the Qt Company beginning around that time under the governance model of the Qt Project. The developers hoped to eventually push for Qbs to replace qmake as Qt's own build system. However, in October 2018 it was deprecated in favor of qmake and/or cmake. In an August 7 2019 blog post, the Qt Company stated that starting with Qt 6, cmake will become Qt's standard build system and cited cmake's extreme popularity as a factor. Qbs development was taken over by external volunteers, who as of June 2020 are still actively maintaining it under the Qt Project umbrella. Although the Qt Company announced that they would stop further development on Qbs, they committed to provide the necessary infrastructure for future releases of Qbs by the community.

Biography Hayward was born in Wolverhampton, England, and died in Dunedin while promoting his last film. He was the son of Rudall and Adelina Hayward, who came to New Zealand in 1905. With Henry John Hayward (1866–1945) Rudall senior’s brother, his parents were involved with entertainment and silent cinema in New Zealand, in West’s Pictures and The Brescians. Rudall (junior) was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School from 1916 to 1917 and the Waihi School of Mines. He worked in Australia c1920 under Raymond Longford (who in 1915-16 was filming in New Zealand), on some of Longford's films: The Sentimental Bloke, On Our Selection, and Rudd’s New Selection. He made his first two-reel comedy The Bloke from Freeman’s Bay in 1920 (which his uncle Henry offered him £50 to burn). He was prosecuted by the Auckland City Council in the Police Court and fined £1 on each of two charges for putting up posters for The Bloke from Freeman’s Bay in unauthorised places contrary to city by-laws, in October 1921. His first feature was My Lady of the Cave (1922). In 1923 he married Hilda Moren and she worked with him on his later projects as an editor and producer: Rewi’s Last Stand (1925), The Te Kooti Trail (1927), and The Bush Cinderella (1928). In 1928-30 the couple made 23 two-reel \\"community comedies\\" with local settings and actors at various towns, and titles like: Tilly of Te Aroha, Hamilton’s Hectic Husbands, A Daughter of Dunedin, Winifred of Wanganui, Natalie of Napier, and Patsy of Palmerston. Lee Hill worked with Haywood on these, then went into competition with him. His first sound film was On the Friendly Road (1936) with Colin Scrimgeour, and he remade Rewi’s Last Stand with sound (1939). In 1943 he married the star of the movie, Ramai Te Miha. His films were made on a shoestring budget, and in an interview from 1961 Hayward explains, “We had a sound camera which I built up with the help of friends who had lathes. Other parts I had made by Auckland companies, and I laboriously paid off the cost because no one was earning very much. We had a sound engineer, Jack Baxendale, a brilliant pioneering ham radio enthusiast, and he built not only the recording side but also the microphones. It was a major task for anyone to build condenser microphones in those days.”THE LAST STAND at ARCHIVING PRACTICE, FILM, NZ HISTORY accessed 5 Aug 2016 After World War II he worked in England, then made his most successful film The Amazing Dolphin of Opononi about Opo the dolphin. He made educational films in New Zealand and overseas, then his final film To Love a Maori (1972), which was shot on 16 mm. In the 1973 Queen's Birthday Honours, Hayward was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community. References *Geoffrey Churchman, etc. 1997.

Number and condition of homeless people The UK homeless charity Shelter estimated in 2017 that the number of people in the UK who were entirely homeless or in temporary accommodation was 300,000. Rough sleepers are only a small proportion of the homeless. Crisis estimates there are roughly 12,300 rough sleepers in the UK and also 12,000 people sleeping in sheds, bins, cars, tents and night busses. The figure is derived from research by Heriot-Watt University. Homeless people sleeping in bins are sometimes crushed to death by compacting machinery or otherwise killed when bins are collected and dealt with by waste disposal companies.Deaths of homeless people sleeping in bins prompt calls for action The Guardian According to figures from the Department of Communities and Local Government, the number of people registered as homeless with local councils was just over 100,000 in 1998, rose to 135,000 in 2003 before declining in the years up to and during the Great Recession. After a low of 40,000 in 2009 and 2010, the figure rose to just under 60,000 in 2017. The number living in temporary accommodation rose from 50,000 in 1998 to 100,000 in 2005, declining back to 50,000 in 2011, then rising to 80,000 in 2017. The number of rough sleepers was 4,800 in 2017 compared to 1,800 in 2010, when comparable records begin. Crisis attributes rising homelessness to a shortage of social housing, housing benefits not covering private rents and a shortage of homeless prevention schemes for people leaving care.Homelessness: Thousands sleeping rough in cars, Crisis says BBC Of the homeless people who died in 2017, the average age was 44 for men and 42 for women. Suicide, drug and alcohol abuse are the most common causes of death among homeless people. History of homelessness support Major instances of homelessness in the history of the United Kingdom have included: * the Highland Clearances and Lowland Clearances in Scotland (19th century) * the Great Famine in Ireland (1845-1852) * intimidation during the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), including the destruction of country houses * strategic aerial bombing during Second World War, including the Blitz (1940-1941), the Baby Blitz (1944) and the V-weapons offensive (1944-1945) * the North Sea flood of 1953 (resulting in 30,000 people becoming homeless) * the 1969 Northern Ireland riots (around 1,800 families made homeless) and subsequent intimidation during and following the Troubles Historically, homelessness support was provided by monastic communities but after the Reformation, governmental support was provided by means of the poor law, which differed in England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland; though under the same Crown for most of this time, these were different jurisdictions. Eventually, a system of elected local authorities replaced the looser organisation of disparate local administrative bodies, including poor law unions. Prevention To prevent homelessness Crisis maintains with support from Justin WelbyHomelessness could be ended ‘within a decade’ with £10bn of government investment, charity claims The Independent the public sector should: *Build 100,500 social homes a year to address the needs of homeless people and those on low income. *Introduce Housing First nationally providing homes and specialized support for homeless people. *Improve rights for private renters and improve housing benefit. *The care system, hospitals, prisons should be legally required to help find homes for those leaving their care. *There should be homelessness specialists at Job Centres.Homelessness could end in a decade, says charity Crisis BBC Causes of homelessness A homeless man near Princes Street in Edinburgh. The longer term causes of homelessness have been examined by a number of research studies. A number of different pathways into homelessness have been identified; research suggests that both personal factors (e.g. addictions) and structural factors (e.g. poverty) are ultimately responsible for the sequence of events that results in homelessness. For young people, there are additional factors that appear to be involved, most notably needing to face the responsibilities of independent living before they are ready for them. Rising cost of housing and increasing job insecurity have also been identified as contributing factors. Modern Governmental Assistance Homeless shelter in London, 1866 Policy on homelessness is overseen by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and Homes and Communities Agency in England, the Scottish Government Housing and Social Justice Directorate, the Welsh Government, and the Department for Communities and Northern Ireland Housing Executive in Northern Ireland. It has been a devolved policy area outside England since the introduction of devolution in the 1990s. The Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 focused national attention on homelessness and housing quality, and resulted in around 255 people becoming homeless overnight. Half of young people at risk of homelessness in the UK who approach their local authority, get no significant help.Half of young people facing homelessness denied help – report The Guardian All Local Housing Authorities (LHAs) in the United Kingdom have a legal statutory duty to provide 24-hour advice to homeless people, or those who are at risk of becoming homeless within 28 days. Once an individual applies to the appropriate City Council, Borough Council, District Council or Unitary Authority for assistance, from a person claiming to be homeless (or threatened with homelessness), the Local Housing Authority is also legally duty bound to make detailed inquiries into that person's circumstances, in order to decide whether they meet the criteria, which are defined as statutory homelessness. For people meeting such criteria, the Local Housing Authority therefore has a legal statutory duty to find Temporary Accommodation for the person, and then provide them with assistance to find a permanent, long term adequate dwelling, that will usually be within the Private Rented Sector (PRS), but sometimes will be a property with a Housing Association, a council house, or a council flat. =Statutory homelessness= Definition A person suffers statutory homelessness if governmental regulations oblige the council to provide housing-related support to the person. At present this criteria is met if (and only if) all of the following conditions are true: *they do not have a permanent home *the person is not prevented from accessing UK public funds by immigration laws *the person has a local connection to the local authority's area (this could, for example, be the residential presence of family, friends, or previous residence of the person themselves) *the person unintentionally become homeless (this does not include eviction for non-payment of rent) *the person is in priority need; this condition has been abolished in Scotland since the start of 2013, and there are campaigns for it to be abolished in the rest of the UK. The definition of priority need varies between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, but generally includes any of following conditions being met: *pregnancy *a dependant child *an age of 16-17 *aged 18–20 and leaving local authority care *vulnerability due to **old age, or **mental illness, or **mental/physical disability **leaving the armed forces **leaving prison *fleeing, or at the risk of, domestic violence *homelessness due to an emergency (such as flood, fire, or other disaster) A person does not have to be roofless to legally qualify as lacking a permanent home. They may be in possession of accommodation which it is not reasonably feasible to continue to use by virtue of its affordability, condition, or location. The requirement to have a local connection does not apply if it would lead to the applicant becoming a victim of violence, or at risk of violence. In Wales, priority need was similarly extended to include individuals who are aged 18 to 20 and at risk of financial or sexual exploitation, but provided they are leaving care. Consequences Temporary accommodation must be provided to those that might be suffering statutory homelessness, pending a final decision. Often bed and breakfast hotels are used for temporary accommodation, unless a suitable hostel or refuge is available. The suitability of temporary accommodation is often a topic of concern for local media, and pressure groups. If the council concludes that the applicant suffers statutory homelessness then the local authority has a legal duty to find long-term accommodation for the applicant and their household (those dependants who would ordinarily be living with them), and any other person whom it is reasonable to expect to reside with them. The council must offer/continue to provide temporary accommodation to such an applicant, on an immediate basis, until long-term accommodation is found for them. Long-term accommodation may not necessarily be a socially rented home (one provided by the council, or by a Housing Association); the council can discharge its duty by finding an appropriate private sector tenancy for the applicant. =Non-statutory homelessness= If the authority decides that a person does lack a home, but does not qualify as suffering statutory homelessness, then a lesser obligation applies. Where the applicant merely lacks a local connection to the council, the council will usually refer the applicant's case to a local authority with which they do have a local connection. If the applicant is in priority need, but is considered to have become homeless intentionally, the local authority is obliged to provide temporary accommodation for as long as is reasonably necessary for the applicant to find long-term accommodation; this is usually a fortnight, but additional periods of similar length can sometimes be provided at the council's discretion (typically granted in cases of extenuating circumstances). =Rough sleeping= A national service, called Streetlink, was established in 2012 to help members of the public obtain near-immediate assistance for specific rough sleepers, with the support of the Government (as housing is a devolved matter, the service currently only extends to England). Currently, the service doesn't operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis. The UK government has cut funding to local authorities and local authorities feel forced to reduce services for homeless people. It is feared this will increase the numbers of rough sleepers and increase the numbers dying while sleeping rough. A member of the public who is concerned that someone is sleeping on the streets can report the individual's details via the Street Link website or by calling 0300 500 0914. Someone who finds themselves sleeping on the streets can also report their situation using the same methods. It is important to note that the Streetlink service is for those who are genuinely sleeping on the streets, and not those who may merely be begging, or ostensibly living their life on the streets despite a place to sleep elsewhere (such as a hostel or supported accommodation). The service aims to respond within 24 hours, including an assessment of the individual circumstances and an offer of temporary accommodation for the following nights. The response typically includes a visit to the rough sleeper early in the morning that follows the day or night on which the report has been made. The service operates via a number of charities and with the assistance of local councils. Soup Run provided by a charity Where appropriate, rough sleepers will also be offered specialist support: *if they have substance misuse issues, they will be referred for support from organisations such as St. Mungo's (despite the name, this is a non-religious charity) *if they are foreign nationals with no right to access public funds in the UK, repatriation assistance will be offered, including finding accommodation in the home country, construction of support plans, and financial assistance. At least 50 local authorities have enacted Public Space Protection Orders to deter begging in town centres.Hundreds of homeless people fined and imprisoned in England and Wales The Guardian Liberty has argued that these ordinances are illegal and that homeless people often lack the access to legal aid needed to challenge them.Legal Aid Agency taken to court for refusing to help rough sleepers The Guardian Other sources of assistance Practical advice regarding homelessness can be obtained through a number of major non- governmental organisations including, *Citizens Advice Bureaus and some other charities also offer free legal advice in person, by telephone, or by email, from qualified lawyers and others operating on a pro bono basis *Shelter provides extensive advice about homelessness and other housing problems on their website, and from the telephone number given there, including about rights and legal situations.

The field was used from 1928 until 1974. It is considered one of the most novel ballparks ever conceived thanks to its location. There was a limestone cliff in the outfield that created havoc for outfielders and made baseball games exciting. It was replaced by UFCU Disch- Falk Field in 1975. Cliff Clark Field was unusual because there was a 12- to limestone cliff that ran from left-center to center field that made playing the outfield adventurous. The cliff could only be accessed via a goat path in the left-center field. Center field was nicknamed \\"Billy Goat Hill.\\" There was a scoreboard on top of the hill in the field in front of the fence that could cause even more weird bounces for outfielders. Clearly, this gave the Longhorns a home field advantage over visiting teams. For example, the Longhorns could easily get an inside-the-park home run when a ball was hit in the direction of the cliff because the opposing outfielders were perplexed by its caroms and how to make plays by using the cliff. Longhorn outfielders could typically hold batters to a double or triple because of their familiarity with the cliff. Half of the team's outfielders purportedly chose to play on top while the other half chose to play in front of the cliff.http://www.baseballgb.co.uk/?p=1194 Atmosphere While the ballpark had an irregular outfield, the stadium only sat 2,000. The stadium had an intimate yet palatial feeling that mirrored other jewel box ballparks such as Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium.When the Disch was new - Sports Houston Community Newspapers Online - Newer doesn't necessarily mean better to everybody Once when the Texas A&M; Aggies visited Clark Field, the crowd overflowed into right field and rowdiness ensued, which happened regularly when other visiting teams played there as well. In the late 1960s, the Sam Houston State Bearkats regularly opened with weekend doubleheaders in Austin. Miscellaneous According to legend, Lou Gehrig hit a towering home run over \\"Billy Goat Hill\\" and the high fence in center field during a 1930 exhibition game.www.TexasSports.com The dimensions of Clark Field were to the left field wall, to deepest center, and to right field.At Play in the Fields of the Lord: Texas Monthly April 1974http://www.texassports.com/sports/m-basebl/spec- rel/041510aaa.html Six no-hitters were thrown at Clark Field all by the Longhorns during its tenure.TexasSports.com - Texas Baseball History: No Hitters The Longhorns won an astonishing 37 Southwest Conference baseball championships as well as two College World Series championships (1949-1950), being runner-up in 1953 and College World Series appearances in 1952, 1957, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1972, 1973, and 1974 while calling Clark Field home. Clark Fields There have been three athletic facilities on the campus named for the university's influential early leader James Benjamin Clark. The first Clark Field, at the southeast corner of 24th Street and Speedway, operated from 1887 through 1927, then was closed for the construction of the Mechanical Engineering Building a.k.a. Taylor Hall. The field was located a couple of blocks northwest of Memorial Stadium. For 1928 the second and best-known Clark Field was inaugurated, north of Memorial Stadium, on the northwest corner of 23rd Street and Red River Street. That corner was the location of center field, as the diamond was in the northwest corner of the lot. Red River was later renamed Robert Dedman Drive, and the current thoroughfare designated as Red River Street is a block farther east, on the other side of the LBJ Library. That building is visible in the background of some of the later photos of Clark Field. That same year, 1928, a recreation area called Freshman Field was opened, just southwest of Memorial Stadium, at a location given by the UT writeup as \\"east of Waller Creek between 19th and 21st Streets\\", although it appears that it was actually west of Waller Creek. For 1975 the baseball team moved to their new ballpark, and Clark Field was closed to allow construction of the College of Fine Arts and the Performing Arts Center. Freshman Field was soon renamed as the third Clark Field. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Clark Field property underwent significant redevelopment, but a portion of the field was retained as Clark Field, a roughly oval-shaped field surrounded by a track. The current field is bounded by the creek and San Jacinto Boulevard to the northeast, east and southeast; and touched by Jester Circle to the west. The rest of the field is bounded by campus buildings.

The twin phenomenon is centered in Linha São Pedro, a small settlement in the city of Cândido Godói, in an ethnically homogeneous population of German descent.  Twinning rate  The rate of twin births in Cândido Godói is 10%, significantly higher than the overall 1.8% rate for the state of Rio Grande do Sul. This rate is unusual, exceeding the highest observed national twinning rate (4.5 to 5% for southwestern Nigeria). Nearly half (8 of 17) of twins examined in one study were monozygotic (identical) twins, a few more than the average of 30%. Twin births were noted from the early twentieth century, when the first immigrants included seventeen sets of twins, and have been observed through several generations in the latter part of the twentieth century. The population is largely of Polish or German ancestry, with many tracing ancestry to the Hunsrück region of Germany, which has a higher than average twinning rate. The rate in Cândido Godói could reflect genetic founder effect: rare genetic traits occurring by chance among a small group founding a community will be more common among their descendants than in the population at large. = Explanation attempts = The notorious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, who had conducted twin \\"studies\\" in Germany and experiments with twins in Auschwitz, is known to have fled to South America as the Allies were closing in on the Nazi German regime. The Argentine historian Jorge Camarasa has suggested that Mengele conducted experiments on women in the area, which could be responsible for the high ratio of twins. According to some commentators, about the time of Mengele's arrival in southern Brazil in 1963, the incidence of twins began to increase, allegedly leading to the current rate of twinning at 1 in 10, over half of whom are dizygotic (fraternal). However, such speculation has been disputed by local historian, Paulo Sauthier, who says Mengele did not study twins during his time in Brazil. Moreover, according to geneticists, the most likely explanation for the high frequency of twins is genetic isolation and inbreeding. Records indicate that the high frequency of twins predates Mengele's arrival to South America. This phenomenon of a large number of twin births is not unique to Cândido Godói, and has also been observed in the town of Igbo-Ora in Nigeria and the village of Kodinhi in India.

Early life Adelheid was born in Schloss Hetzendorf, the second child and eldest daughter of the then Archduke Charles of Austria and his wife Zita of Bourbon-Parma. On 7 January 1914 she was baptised by Friedrich Gustav Piffl, Prince Archbishop of Vienna; her baptismal names were Adelheid Maria Josepha Sixta Antonia Roberta Ottonia Zita Charlotte Luise Immakulata Pia Theresia Beatrix Franziska Isabella Henriette Maximiliana Genoveva Ignatia Marcus d'Aviano. Her godparents were her father's mother Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony and her mother's brother Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma.Wiener Zeitung (8 Jänner 1914): 1. On 21 November 1916 Adelheid's great-grand uncle the Emperor Franz Joseph died and her father succeeded him as Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. During the First World War Adelheid would often accompany her brother Crown Prince Otto and father on trips to inspect the Austrian troops. Following the Austro-Hungarian Empire's defeat in the war her father was forced to renounce participation in state affairs and subsequently the empire was dismantled and republics were established in Austria and Hungary. In 1919 Adelheid and her family were sent into exile first in Switzerland before later being taken to Portuguese island of Madeira. On 9 March 1922 Adelheid was with her brother Otto and father Emperor Charles when he went into town to buy toys for Carl Ludwig's birthday. On the way back they were enveloped by chill mists and her father caught a cold which later developed in pneumonia from which he died on April 1. In December 1933 she became the first member of her family to set foot in Vienna since the establishment of the republic when she arrived by train from Budapest. Adelheid attended the University of Louvain and gained a doctorate in 1938. During the Second World War she emigrated with most of her family to the United States to escape the Nazis. Archduchess Adelheid later returned to Europe. She died unmarried in Pöcking, Bavaria.

He is the subject of an Australian book published in 2010 called Capturing Asia, by former foreign correspondent Bob Wurth. During his years working on risky assignments, Phua captured many images of wars and uprisings, economic 'miracles' and social upheavals, and the rise and fall of dictators. Phua's camerawork was seen in Australia through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, but his most important assignments were also shown around the world, sometimes on the BBC. He was one of the few TV cameramen to capture the \\"Tank Man\\" briefly holding back Chinese tanks near Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989.Wurth, Bob, Capturing Asia, An ABC cameraman's journey through momentous events and turbulent history, ABC Books (HarperCollins) Sydney, 436 pp; Archives, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Sydney. Early years In 1933 Phua came from Hainan island to Singapore with his mother, Phua Tan Tee, to join his father Phua Gee Wah, at the age of five to find a better life on the British isle. Hainan at that time was wracked by insurgency and the island swept by damaging typhoons. Phua has clear recollections as a youth of the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the subsequent occupation of the island in 1942. On the morning of 8 December 1941, a bomb whistled down and crashed into a well near the servants' quarters in the League of Nations compound off River Valley Road where Phua lived. Japan's war had come to Singapore. To the dismay of his mother, Phua, aged 12, ran into the compound and picked up a piece of still warm metal, a fragment from one of the first Japanese bombs to fall on Singapore: \\"I was a little bit frightened but also excited. This was something exciting for a boy of my age. It was the first bombing attack on Singapore. We didn’t know the Japanese were coming here until these bombs fell.\\" Phua still remembers during the invasion of Singapore, watching the retreat of the British and Australians through the streets and of a young, bewildered Allied soldier sitting in the gutter, weeping. During the invasion, Phua's neighbourhood was shelled by Japanese artillery. He survived by crouching in a stinking storm drain in Killinery Road with his mother. One shell landed nearby killing a neighbour.'Capturing Asia', pp 1–3 & 14–34. During the Japanese occupation, the youth traded in cigarettes and was chased by Japanese soldiers when plying his trade: \\"I passed a Japanese soldier with his rifle over his shoulder. In the usual way, I asked if he had any tobacco. He looked at me and suddenly lifted his hand and took a big swing at my face. I ducked to avoid it. As I was turning around to run I saw him take the rifle from his shoulder. I ran for my life. I was terrified.\\" Young Phua escaped and changed his trading habits. His mother made curry puffs and Phua sold them to Australian prisoners-of-war being marched through the streets. Phua's mother obtained work as a cook in the kitchen of Japanese brothels in Cairnhill Road and the young Phua became her messenger. He recalls the sadness of some of the so-called \\"comfort women\\", the Koreans forced into prostitution by the Japanese: \\"I did errands for the girls and would also buy things for the Japanese soldiers. The girls always seemed to want food. When the women had a Japanese client, especially if they had found a captain or a higher rank, they would say ‘I’m hungry’ and ask the soldiers to buy noodles for them.\\" 'Capturing Asia', pp 31–34 Post-war After the war Phua became a salesman at Singapore's Amateur Photo Shop, before becoming a freelance cameraman in the early 1960s with Singapore's RTV and BCINA (British Commonwealth International News Agency) which later became Visnews (now Reuters Television) and Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Major assignments On the first day he signed up as a freelance cameraman for Radio Television Singapore (RTS) in 1963, a large fire broke out at the Bukit Ho Swee squatter settlement in Singapore. Quickly on the scene, he captured the population fleeing the flames and his film was shown on RTS within a few hours. Four people were killed, 85 injured and 16,000 shanty houses were destroyed. Phua went on to cover violent race riots in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and clashes in Borneo as Indonesia's President Sukarno pressed his Konfrontasi, or Confrontation policy, with the newly established Malaysia. In 1971 he filmed Pakistani Army killings during the birth of the new state of Bangladesh, then East Pakistan. Phua's then correspondent on the assignment, Australian Don Hook, remembers: \\"From the roof of the Inter- Continental Hotel in Dacca, Phua shot graphic film of horrific events in the street below. Soldiers had deliberately set fire to a newspaper building. As newspaper staff ran from the blazing building there were bursts of automatic fire followed by screams and calls for help.\\" Hook and Phua, along with other media people, were rounded up and forced to fly out of the country.Don Hook & Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 120–132 Phua had seven lengthy assignments to cover the Vietnam war during 1971 and 1972. Once working with ABC correspondent Athol Meyer he was shelled at an American base in the central highlands. He was almost killed in the war in April 1972 when the South Vietnamese patrol boat he was aboard came under machine gun and rocket fire on the Saigon River. The patrol boat’s gunner was the first to be hit by Viet Cong fire and lost a leg. Then Phua's sound recordist was severely wounded in the leg.Visnews manager Juliette Suong & Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 156–175. Phua covered the major riots in Manila which followed the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino at Manila International Airport in August 1983. While filming the shooting of demonstrators by soldiers at Mendiola Bridge near the presidential palace that year, he was hit by a hail of rocks, but his injuries were not major.Scan Magazine, ABC, November 1983; Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 265–270; ABC Archives, film, Sydney. Phua was known to many Asian leaders over the years. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi would welcome him in New Delhi with the words: \\"Ah, my good Chinese friend.\\" Says Phua: \\"Frankly, I think she was a nice person.\\" Philippines foreign minister Carlos Romulo would single him out in a press pack and take him aside for a chat. ABC correspondent Peter Munckton recalled the Philippines' first lady Imelda Marcos doing the same. The last time he saw Indira Gandhi, he filmed her prone on her death bed after being assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984. Phua covered the funeral rites for Gandhi and the subsequent genocide against the Sikhs in New Delhi and elsewhere in India following the assassination. Rioting, burning of buildings and general lawlessness spread throughout New Delhi. The chief of Network Australia, the ABC's overseas TV service, Bruce Dover, was then a correspondent working alongside Phua: \\"There was a mob hauling the Sikhs from their homes and breaking their legs so that they couldn’t run away, then pouring oil over them to burn them alive. They were mostly Sikh men but also Sikh boys.\\" Phua filmed the mayhem: \\"I remember seeing bodies everywhere. It was so gruesome. I only wanted to shoot a little bit—a few wide shots because you couldn’t show the close-ups and then I just wanted to get out of there...The odd policeman just stood around, doing nothing.\\" The ABC’s long- time New Delhi driver, Joseph Madan, who still works for the ABC in New Delhi, says Phua saved his life. Phua was surrounded by angry mobs on several occasions and repeatedly put his life at risk. He filmed truck loads of the bodies of Sikhs, including children, who had been burned to death in Delhi.Former ABC correspondent Peter Munckton, head Network Australia Bruce Dover & Joseph Madan in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 272–281. Also, ABC Archives, Sydney. Among the many memorable images he captured were those of a lone bag-carrying demonstrator known as Tank Man confronting People's Liberation Army (PLA) tanks during Beijing's Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. The ABC's bureau chief in Asia at the time, Tony Eastley, says he believes there were two television cameramen who captured the iconic television images of the 'tank man'; Phua and an American cameraman. CNN cameraman Jonathon Schaer told Phua's biographer that he also shot the famous tank scene from a balcony in the same hotel as Phua. Phua as he filmed could not help acknowledge the bravery of the man holding up the tanks: Outside on the balcony I can see all the tanks coming up and this one single student standing in front of it. I think he is thinking, ‘Run me down if you can!’ And the first tank stopped exactly in front of him and there was some talking going on. And the next thing, he is climbing on top of the tank and he is speaking with the driver. Later on he climbed down and he’s still standing in front of the tank.\\" Eastley & Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 325–344. Phua felt his life had been blessed, as he had many close calls to death in his photojournalist career, according to friend and colleague, John McBeth, writing in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper. Like one time a Vietcong ambush came upon him while filming a German documentary aboard a South Vietnamese patrol boat in the Mekong Delta in 1971. For everything else, McBeth said, Phua's formula for success in getting the right scoop lay in the planning on how to seize the best vantage point. For instance, he recalled, Phua spent much of his time getting access to a block of flats to get a good elevated shot of the prison to cover the news of the hanging of two Australian traffickers in Kuala Lumpur in 1986, for ABC. He also attributed calm and reasoning wit to getting things to work his way, especially towards handling brushes with authorities. Retirement from television Phua had worked as a cameraman throughout Asia for well over three decades when he was pressured into retirement by a back that could no longer carry heavy camera equipment. He realised the need to retire when climbing Japan's Mount Fuji in 1993 on an assignment with ABC Tokyo correspondent Philip Williams and sound recordist Jone Chang, as Williams recalls: \\"As you get higher, it gets harder ... we were going with Willie and a couple of others and we were all carrying gear. There were ten stations to go through. Willie finally said, ‘You’ll have to go on without me.' It was in fact the end of the road for him, I think, symbolically and in a very real sense. He left the ABC and the industry very shortly after that.\\" Phua was later invited to join the board of a Malaysian finance and entertainment company, DKH-George Town Holdings group, chaired by Tunku Abdullah.Philip Williams and Willie Phua in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia', pp 363–365, 370–371 Recognition In November 1996, Phua received the Honorary Medal of the Order of Australia for his services. The citation for Phua's award read:‘Mr Phua’s camera work has been responsible for Australians seeing all aspects of life in Asia, thus stimulating Australian interest in the region.’ The award was presented by New South Wales Governor Gordon Samuels. In 1993, Phua officially retired from his news-hunting days.John McBeth, Straits Times, Singapore, 1 March 2008. In a foreword to Phua's biography in 2010, the managing director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Mark Scott, said Phua was long regarded as one of the finest news cameramen in Asia: \\"From 1963 on, so much of what Australians learnt and understood about Asia came to them through the lens of an unseen yet unforgettable Chinese-born cameraman called Willie Phua.\\" Mark Scott foreword in Wurth, 'Capturing Asia'.

In other words, the essentials for covering the region.—Peter Munckton, ABC correspondent who covered the Vietnam War news. * Here you had a gifted cinematographer with a keen eye for news, steeped in the history of his working environment and all its sensitivities, willingly moulding and protecting a string of young, ambitious Australians on their foreign assignments.—Paul Lockyer, ABC correspondent.

Distance to the capital: 441 km (274 mi) Location The municipality of Dom Pedrito ends in the south, on a short border, with the Department of Rivera, Uruguay, and the lands of Terras da Tempestade. The state, borders the west with Santana do Livramento and Lanisporto, in the north with Rosario do Sul, with Tridente, with Sao Gabriel (very small municipal border) and with Lavras do Sul. To the east it borders with Bage and Vale. The city is served by the water basin of the rivers Camaquã and Santa Maria. It finally rises in the northeast of the city. The highway BR-293 connects the municipality to Bagé and to Santana do Livramento.  History Taken from Bagé, the population arose because of contraband. A Spaniard, Pedro Ansuateguy, known as Dom Pedrito, organized this illegal activity, opening the path that gave way to roads, hence the origin of the name of the municipality. The population of the region began in 1800, and was emancipated in 1872. Initially, it was called Our Lady of Sponsorship of Dom Pedrito; subsequently, it came to be called only Dom Pedrito. In 1888, the center was elevated to the status of city. This region was badly hit by three armed conflicts, the Farroupiha revolution, the Federalist revolution of 1893, and by the Revolution of 1923. The peace treaty of the Farroupilha revolution was signed in Ponche Verde (Dom Pedrito), which caused the capital to be known as the \\"Capital of Peace\\". After the Revolution of 1923, there was a huge growth in progress throughout the area, principally in the sectors of livestock and wheat. Dom Pedrito has always kept its geographic distribution since its emancipation, not giving land to any other municipality. At the end of the twentieth century there was a huge growth in rice cultivation in the municipality. At the beginning of the 21st century, vineyards were planted for the industrial production of wine. The municipality also grows other fruits, like melon.  Religion The majority of the population in the city declares itself Catholic, however in the last few years there has been a considerable amount of growth in the number of Protestants in the municipality. A few notable ones are the Foursquare, Assembly of God, Baptist, Church of God and Love, among others.

Upon mobilization, Air Force Space Command would assume operational command of the 253 CEIG. At the state level, the group provides forces to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for use during local or statewide disasters.  History  The 253rd Cyberspace Engineering Installation Group relocated from Wellesley, MA to Otis in 1996 due to mission and equipment changes. = Post Cold War = Desert Shield/Storm began on 7 August 1991 after the invasion of Kuwait. Within ten days the 253d Combat Communications Group units were involved in deploying equipment to support the Air Force and coalition forces in the Gulf. Volunteers from the 267CBCS, solicited by the 253d Combat Communications Group Readiness Center, joined other Group members to deploy and support Desert Shield. = Global War on Terror = In 2001, the 267 CBCS, collocated with the 253d Combat Communications Group, facilitated the first use of the Theater Deployable Communications Equipment during Operation Enduring Freedom. More than 20 personnel mobilized for the mission from September 2001 to July 2003. They augmented the Headquarters Air Combat Command staff in filling requirements for the U.S. Air Force/ANG.

He competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics as a member of China's first Olympic basketball team, and coached the Chinese men's team at the 1952 Summer Olympics. He served as President of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and was named Lifetime Honorary President of the Asian Basketball Association. In 2005, the CBA named the championship trophy of China's professional basketball league the Mou Zuoyun Cup. In 2019, he posthumously became the first Chinese inductee to the FIBA Hall of Fame.  Early life and 1936 Summer Olympics  Mou Zuoyun was born in 1913 into a peasant family in Wuqing, Hebei (now part of Tianjin municipality), Republic of China. When he was a student at Yuying School (now Beijing No. 25 Middle School), he was selected into the national basketball team to compete in the 1934 Far Eastern Championship Games held in Manila, and won the silver medal. In 1935, Mou entered the Department of Physical Education of Beijing Normal University and joined the university's basketball team. A year later, he was again selected into the Republic of China national team to compete in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. It was the first time basketball became an Olympic sport and the first time China sent a full delegation to the Olympic Games. Because of political instability and shortage of funds, the delegation endured a 17-day sea journey to Germany and the team was soon eliminated.  Wartime refuge and study abroad  Upon graduation in 1937, Mou was hired by Beijing Normal University as a faculty member, However, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in July, and Beijing soon fell to Japanese occupation. Together with many professors and students in northern China, Mou sought refuge in inland Kunming, Yunnan province, where they established the temporary National Southwestern Associated University. Mou was hired by John Ma, the founder of China's modern physical education, as the university's basketball coach. He married Ma's second daughter, Ma Peilun, in 1944. After the end of World War II, Mou went to the United States in 1946 for a two-year graduate program at Springfield College, the birthplace of basketball where Jack Ma had graduated from. He earned his bachelor's degree in physical education the next year, and intended to complete the graduate program. He cut his study short to return to China when he was appointed the coach of the Chinese national team for the 1948 Summer Olympics. For political reasons, however, the appointment was later rescinded.  People's Republic of China  After the Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, Mou was appointed the head coach of the China men's national basketball team. In 1952, he led the PRC national team to compete in the Helsinki Olympic Games. However, due to a dispute over whether the PRC or the ROC, which had fled to Taiwan after losing the war, was the legal government of China, the PRC delegation arrived late to the Olympics and his team was unable to compete. Mou was appointed Vice President of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) in 1956 and President in 1973. He spent decades training players and building up the sport in China, and oversaw to the rise of both the Chinese men's and women's teams to the top in Asia. Mou retired in 1997. In recognition to his contributions to the sport, he was named Lifetime Honorary President of the Asian Basketball Association and a Lifetime Honorary Committee Member of FIBA. In 1999, Mou was named one of the 50 greatest contributors to basketball in China. In 2005, the CBA named the championship trophy of China's professional basketball league the Mou Zuoyun Cup. Mou died on 16 March 2007, aged 94. When the Chinese player Yao Ming was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016, he paid tribute to Mou in his speech. In 2019, Mou was posthumously inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame; he was the first Chinese inductee. His daughter and grandson attended the award ceremony on his behalf.

Definition =BCI algebra= An algebra (in the sense of universal algebra) \\\\left( X;\\\\ast ,0\\\\right) of type \\\\left( 2,0\\\\right) is called a BCI-algebra if, for any x,y,z\\\\in X, it satisfies the following conditions.

A partial order can then be defined as x ≤ y iff x * y = 0. A BCK-algebra is said to be commutative if it satisfies: : x\\\\ast (x\\\\ast y)= y\\\\ast (y\\\\ast x) In a commutative BCK-algebra x * (x * y) = x ∧ y is the greatest lower bound of x and y under the partial order ≤. A BCK-algebra is said to be bounded if it has a largest element, usually denoted by 1. In a bounded commutative BCK-algebra the least upper bound of two elements satisfies x ∨ y = 1 * ((1 * x) ∧ (1 * y)); that makes it a distributive lattice. Examples Every abelian group is a BCI-algebra, with * defined as group subtraction and 0 defined as the group identity. The subsets of a set form a BCK-algebra, where A*B is the difference A\\\\B (the elements in A but not in B), and 0 is the empty set. A Boolean algebra is a BCK algebra if A*B is defined to be A∧¬B (A does not imply B). The bounded commutative BCK-algebras are precisely the MV-algebras.  References     * Y.

When in 1915, was the City of Encantado, their lands were included in the Districts of Itapuca and Anta Gorda. The opportunity arose with the construction of the road that linked the Encantado Soledade, in 1928. The fact is so striking that in 1931, the town of Ilópolis had already exceeded that of Itapuca, which is not located at the roadside. Seven years later, the Municipal Act number 3, January 10, 1938, becomes Ilópolis District seat, leaving only as Itapuca village. Later it was recreated the District of Itapuca, reducing the area of Ilópolis but without harming its state of progress.

It is most commonly used in the production of American Swiss cheese and Emmental cheese, but is also sometimes used in making other styles of cheese, such as Cheddar, Parmesan, Romano, provolone, and mozzarella. The primary function of L. helveticus culture is to prevent bitterness and produce nutty flavors in the final cheese. In Emmental cheese production, L. helveticus is used in conjunction with a Propionibacterium culture, which is responsible for developing the holes (known as \\"eyes\\") through production of carbon dioxide gas. A 2010 double-blind study published in the British Journal of Nutrition concluded, \\"L. helveticus R0052 and B. longum R0175 taken in combination display anxiolytic-like activity in rats and beneficial psychological effects in healthy human volunteers,\\" showing statistically-significant lowering of anxiety, depression, and anger in the test subjects, as well as improving problem-solving and lowering cortisol. Ingestion of powdered milk fermented with L. helveticus was shown to decrease blood pressure due to the presence of manufactured tripeptides that have ACE inhibitor activity. However, results have been contradictory in later studies. The bacterium's specific name is an adjective derived from \\"Helvetia\\", the Latin name for the region occupied by the ancient Helvetii (and for modern Switzerland).

The first Europeans to settle in the area were German immigrants that arrived in the Sinos River Valley in 1824, coming from the Rhine region in southwestern Germany. The area encompassing Ivoti was originally known as Berghahnerschneiss (Bergahner's aisle) because members of the German family Berghahner were the first to settle in the area. After the provincial law number 635 from 4 November 1867, the area was officially named Bom Jardim (Portuguese for Good Garden) and constituted the third discritct of São Leopoldo. The name Bom Jardim, chosen because the land was favourable for cultivating flowers, was changed by the law number 7.199 from 31 May 1938 to Ivoti, from Tupi-Guarani yvoty, meaning flower. For that reason, the city is currently nicknamed Cidade das Flores (Portuguese for City of the Flowers).Ivoti – História Ivoti received emancipation from São Leopoldo on 19 October 1964 when Governor Ildo Meneghetti signed the law number 4.798, creating the municipality of Ivoti.Ivoti – Sobre a cidade de Ivoti On 20 March 1992, Ivoti lost part of its area after the emancipation of two of its districts, which became the municipalities of Lindolfo Collor and Presidente Lucena. =Mayors= Since its emancipation, Ivoti had the following mayors:Ivoti – Dados gerais * 1965 – 1969: Neldo Holler * 1969 – 1973: Egon Schneck * 1973 – 1977: Neldo Holler * 1977 – 1982: Flávio Klein * 1983 – 1988: Arno Henrique Mueller * 1989 – 1992: Arnaldo Kney * 1993 – 1996: Paulo Gaspar Buchmann * 1997 – 2000: Arnaldo Kney * 2001 – 2004: Arnaldo Kney * 2004 – 2008: Maria de Lourdes Bauermann * 2009 – 2012: Maria de Lourdes Bauermann * 2013 – 2016: Arnaldo Kney * 2017 – : Maria de Lourdes Bauermann See also *List of municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul References Municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul ","title":"Ivoti"},{"id":"16047097","text":"Jaboticaba is a municipality in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

History Mostardas was colonized by Azorean immigrants. In 1738 there was already a military outpost called \\"Guard of the Mustards\\". The name remained until the beginning of the 20th century, when it became known as Mostardas. On the 18th of January 1773, the Freguesia de Mostardas is created. Later it became the district of São José do Norte. On the 26th of December 1963, the district emancipates itself. On 11th of April 1964, Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary branches were established. Regarding the name Mostardas, there is no documented explanation. One of the hypothesis suggest that the city received its name on account of the large amount of the edible vegetable found in the area (see mustard). Another hypothesis listed by the historian Marisa Oliveira Guedes is that the name Mustardas was given not by the amount of the plant, which does not actually exist on the fields, but, because Mostardas were the name of the trenches used during the wars in Portugal, which were covered with a mat made of reed and Taquara bamboo, with camuflage made by the plant Mustard, because this plant does not wither. = Book about the city = The book Histórias Antigas de Mostardas, by Jayme Collares Neto, has genealogical information and histories of past inhabitants.

Não-Me-Toque (literally Touch-Me-Not in Portuguese) is a Brazilian municipality located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.  History  The city's current territory was only explored and occupied when Portuguese descendants established their farms on the place, in the second decade of the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, families of German immigrants also occupied the southern part of the territory, in 1824. In 1949, the first Dutch families arrived to the town, making the city one of the starting points of the Dutch immigration on southern Brazil. There is no exact information of the name's origins, but there are two theories: the abundance of the Dasyphyllum spinescens plant, which name is \\"touch-me-not\\" in Portuguese; or the establishment of the farm \\"Fazenda Não-Me-Toque\\", founded in July 20 of 1885. Because of the constant humiliation the citizens of the city suffered because of the name, it was renamed as Campo Real (Royal Field) on December 1971, until it was changed back after a plebiscite in April 1977.  Geography  Não-Me-Toque is located in the region of the Planalto Médio, in the micro- region of the Alto Jacuí, Rio Grande do Sul.

Generally there are separate laws governing Aboriginal cultural heritage and sacred sites, and historical (sometimes referred to as post-contact or non-Aboriginal) heritage. State laws also allow heritage to be protected through local government regulations, such as planning schemes, as well. Overview The heritage laws seek to protect, preserve, present, and transmit the Australian nation's natural, cultural, and historical heritage. National heritage The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 is legislation passed by the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia to enable the Commonwealth to intervene and, where necessary, preserve and protect areas and objects of particular significance to Australia's Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples..

The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 protects places of World Heritage, National Heritage and Commonwealth Heritage, The Commonwealth Heritage List includes places such as Federally owned telegraph stations, defence sites, migration centres, customs houses, lighthouses, national institutions such as Parliament and High Court buildings, memorials, islands and marine areas. The Australian National Heritage List is a heritage register, including natural, historic and indigenous places deemed to be of outstanding heritage significance to Australia.

Its instruments are the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 and the National Parks and Wildlife Amendment (Aboriginal Ownership) Act 1996 (No. 142). The latter amends the former to \\"provide for Aboriginal ownership of land of Aboriginal cultural significance reserved or dedicated under that Act; to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 to provide for the grant of certain land claims subject to lease, and reservation or dedication, of the land under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974;...\\" and other purposes.

The two countries have had relations for thousands of years, and share great historical and cultural ties. Greece has an embassy in Tehran, and Iran is represented by its embassy in Athens. History Cartoon on the establishment of diplomatic relations between Greece and the then-ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia in 1902 =Ancient= Relations between the two people date back from antiquity and well before the Persian invasion of Greece. By the late 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persian Empire was in control over all of Asia Minor (which included many ethnically Greek areas), as well as many of the Greek islands, Thrace, and the kingdom of Macedonia, the latter two which make up large parts of modern-day northern Greece. There is also the report by Strabo of an Athenian delegation to Persia in 432 BC.D. J. Mosley,Archipresbeutai, Hermes, Vol. 94, No. 3 (1966), pp. 377–381. The relations have evolved from sworn rivalry during the Greco-Persian wars to strong cordiality, since Alexander the Great defeated the Persian Empire. Alexander admired Persian culture, and wanted to create a mixture of Greek and Persian culture which would forever bind and commemorate the two peoples. This legacy of strong cordiality would thus be found back for many more centuries in various parts of the world named as the Greco-Persian culture. A harmonious blend of both Greek and Persian cultural aspects. The Kingdom of Pontus was a prime example of an entity (in Asia Minor) where Iranian and Greek culture, ethnicity, identity, amongst others, mingled. =Medieval= The Sasanian Empire and Byzantine Empire (which was Greek-speaking) were the main powers in southern Europe, Western Asia, and Central Asia. There were many conflicts between them. =Modern= There is a small Christian Greek community in Iran. In Tehran, there is a Greek Orthodox church which opens mostly during the Greek Holy Week. In January 2020, the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis stated that \\"Greece supports the decision of the USA for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani\\" causing an official protest by Iran.Διάβημα διαμαρτυρίας του Ιράν Diplomacy ;Republic of Greece *Tehran (Embassy) ;Republic of Iran *Athens (Embassy)  See also  * Foreign relations of Greece * Foreign relations of Iran * Iran–EU relations References  External links  * Greek Ministry of Foreign Affaires about relations with Iran * Iranian embassy in Athens Iran Greece ","title":"Greece–Iran relations"},{"id":"16047284","text":"Pinhal () is a municipality in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

The village has many different structures, like a general store, a country school, and some relocated old homes which are all set around a large statue of Saint Peter, the patron saint of this mostly catholic municipality. According to official information, the 30 meters tall statue of St. PeterZeho Hora: São Pedro é inaugurado hoje is the same size as the world-famous statue of Christ the Redeemer, found at the top of the Sugarloaf Mountain in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Neo-gothic architecture The church of São Pedro Apóstolo (St. Peter Apostle) of São Pedro do Butiá is a very good example of the neo-gothic architecture which prevailed and characterizes most of the earlier larger religious structures in the Germanic regions in the Northwest of the state. Even more impressive is its parish church: The main church Paróquia Sagrada Família de Narazé (Sacred Family of Nazareth Church) is a much larger and a two-towered neo-gothic construction. Located 15 kilometers away from São Pedro do Butiá, the Igreja Matriz, as it is known, was built between 1913 and 1921 and in the same general revival style.

Tucunduva is a municipality in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Known as the Capital of Mechanized Crops, Tucunduva has the highest grain yield per hectare in Brazil and is also known as the Land of Musicians.  Etymology  The etymological roots of the name \\"Tucunduva\\" are difficult to reach. Some stories say that João Tucunduva was the first resident of the place. His father was called Captain Carvalho Rodrigues Tucunduva and his uncle was Colonel José Rodrigues Tucunduva. Coming from the province of São Paulo, current state of Paraná, where there were forests of small palm trees named in the Guarani language of Tucun and its collective of Uva. This made them come to be known as Rodrigues brothers from the Tucun da Uva lands and it was in his honor that the municipality was renamed Tucunduva.  History  The Municipality of Tucunduva was effectively colonized from 1920 by colonists of Italian origin, from the municipality of Bento Gonçalves which was part of the Old Colonies (first colonies of immigrants in the state of Rio Grande do Sul), and also colonists of Germanic origin from Germany, Erechim and from the Guarani Colony. The main causes of the immigration of settlers to Tucunduva were: * In the municipalities where the colonizers came from, the land was shredded and depleted due to the high number of families; * The railroad that was built in Bento Gonçalves caused a lot of damage and cut the land more; * The installation of the Land and Colonization Commission in Santa Rosa, which was in charge of Colonization in the region. Contributed to this achievement; * The lands, in Tucunduva, were fertile and flat and had low prices and good payment conditions. When the colonizers arrived in Tucunduva they found some families occupying land, which were dispersed and without much organization. In 1926, the Tucunduva settlement was founded. In 1931, the municipality of Santa Rosa was emancipated and the town of Tucunduva became a village and, in 1934, it was elevated to the 7th District of the municipality of Santa Rosa. The municipality of Tucunduva was created on September 10, 1959 through state law number 3,821 / 1959 and this law was published in the Official Gazette on September 11, 1959. Tucunduva's first legislature consisted of seven councilors elected by the people. The first mayor, sworn in on December 31, 1959, was Mr. Florentino Rossato, with Mr. Erminio Carlos Schwerz as vice- mayor. Since 1967, Tucunduva, being a municipality bordering the Argentine Republic, became part of the municipalities in the area of national security and the mayors were appointed by the President of the Republic. Its area was 396 km². In 1992, with the emancipation of Novo Machado, the area became 173.33 km². Also, Tucunduva stopped making limits with the Argentine Republic. The municipality of Tucunduva is located in the Northwest Region of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, 225 mi from the state capital, Porto Alegre. It has a population of approximately 5,988 inhabitants. Tucunduva borders the cities of Horizontina, Novo Machado, Tuparendi, Três de Maio, Santa Rosa, and Dr. Mauricio Cardoso. According to 2004 data, the municipality has 4,598 voters, 2,217 of whom are male and 2,381 female. Agriculture is its main source of resources and there is a concern with the creation of new sources of income in the primary sector, causing a great deal of technical and veterinary assistance by the City Hall and cooperatives, aiming at productivity bigger and better quality. The activity of dairy cattle farming occupies a prominent place in rural properties, as well as pig farming. In the environment, a partnership between the City Hall, the Public Ministry and riverside rural producers, is taking place to recover the riparian forest of the Santa Rosa and Pratos rivers, aiming at the conservation of the springs of the Municipality, guaranteeing the quality and quantity of water for human and animal consumption. In rural properties, there is guidance, monitoring and incentives for the execution and implementation of septic tanks and the proper destination of animal and human waste with the aim of reducing soil and water contamination and also the polluting potential.  Geography  It is located at latitude 27°39'25\\" south and at longitude 54°26'25\\" west, at an altitude of 223 meters. It has an area of 175.96 km².

He usually signed his works: A. Jacquemart. Jacquemart studied under painter Paul Delaroche and sculptor Jean Baptiste Jules Klagmann.Benezit, p.11 He entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1845. Jacquemart exhibited at the Paris Salon from 1847–1879, receiving medals in 1857, 1863 and 1865. He traveled in Egypt and Turkey, and was commissioned by the city of Alexandria, Egypt, to create a colossal statue of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. He sculpted in large, medium and small scale. Many of his works were cast in bronze by the Val d' Osne foundry and some by the silversmith Christofle.Payne, p.408 Ultimately, however, he earned his reputation for his many larger animal works. In 1870 Jacquemart became a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur. Jacquemart died suddenly at his apartment in the Rue de Babylone, Paris on the night of 4 January 1896.La Croix, 7 Jan 1896, p.3 His funeral was delayed until 13 January for the arrival of his son, Maurice, who lived in Tunis and was held at the Eglise Saint Thomas d'Aquin, Paris.La Presse, 8 Jan 1896, p.2La Temps, 6 Jan 1896, p.3  Selected works  * Sphinxes (four), La Fontaine du Palmier, Paris, 1858 * Chimera (two), La Fontaine Saint-Michel, Paris, c.1860 * Evangelists (four), Église Saint-Augustin de Paris, 1862 * Valet au chiens (Huntsman and dogs), many castings (see examples below), 1866Examples include: * Huntsman and dogs at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, c.1879 * Huntsman and dogs at the Forest Glade Gardens, Mt Macedon, Victoria, Australia, c.1879.(http://museumvictoria.com.au/about/mv-blog/feb-2012/huntsman-on-the- hill retrieved 19 Jan 2014) * Hunter and hounds at Beverly Gardens Park, Beverly Hills, California, USA, date unknown.

It was installed in Beverly Hills, USA in 1925 on Armistice Day to commemorate Mr. Longyear's, a local resident, son who was killed in the Battle of Château-Thierry (1918).
