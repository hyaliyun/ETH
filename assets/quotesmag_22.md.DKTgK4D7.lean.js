America, from the Four continents engraved by Julius Goltzius after design by Maerten de Vos, before 1595. Fighting and cannibalism in the background. Early European personifications of America, meaning the Americas, typically come from sets of the Four continents, all that were then known in Europe. These were: Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. The addition of America made these an even more attractive group to represent visually, as sets of four could be placed around all sorts of four-sided objects, or in pairs along the facade of a building with a central doorway. A set of loose conventions quickly arose as to the iconography of the personifications. They were normally female, with Europe queenly and grandly dressed, and clearly the leader of the group. Asia is fully and richly dressed but in an exotic style, with Africa and America at most half-dressed, and given exotic props.Le Corbelier, 216‚Äì218 One of the earliest and most persistent attributes for America was the parrot; these reached Europe by the early 16th century and were highly valued. The feather crown headdress, with the feathers standing up vertically, reflected the actual headgear of some American peoples. A cornucopia, representing the new edible plants from the Americas, was a very common feature (although the familiar apple often seems the most prominent). America is often accompanied by an improbably placid caiman or alligator, reasonably comparable to Old World crocodiles, though the earliest images may show an exotic armadillo. The pattern for Early Modern depictions was set by reports from Central and South America, and largely remained in place until some way into the 19th century, when European contact with North American Native Americans began to occur. In the 18th century, British America began to use personifications based on Britannia and Liberty, as well as Columbia, something of a combination of these. As more new nations became independent in the Americas, new national personifications were adopted. European images Set of porcelain figures, German, c. 1775, from left: Asia, Europe, Africa, America, with parrot and cornucopia. The addition of America to the previous three continents or \\"parts of the world\\" was not immediate after 1492, as it took some years to establish that America was not an eastern edge of Asia, as Christopher Columbus continued to think until his death,Haase and Reinhold, 48‚Äì49 and was a very large land mass comparable to the others. The very notion of a continent was uncertain,Haase and Reinhold, 52‚Äì56 and contemporary intellectuals tried to integrate the newly-discovered lands into the already complicated and disputed picture of world geography inherited from the Ancient Greeks.Haase and Reinhold, 6‚Äì74, especially 47‚Äì52 Some of the earliest recorded personifications came from the court of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence. Although not at all involved in the exploration of the Americas (the Habsburgs had by the 1520s made it very difficult for any Italians to travel there), the Medicis were very interested in them, and had acquired a good collection of artifacts, plants, and animals. For Cosimo's politically important wedding to Eleanor of Toledo, a distant cousin of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1539, the lavish street decorations for the procession included images of Charles with personifications of Spain, New Spain and Peru. No images survive, but the official festival book has text descriptions, although they had clearly not been explained properly to the author. He says the naked New Spain held a \\"pine cone\\", no doubt intended to be a pineapple, and Peru \\"had with her a sheep with a long neck\\" ‚Äì a llama. Charles's own wedding procession in 1526 in Seville had included representations of American Indians.Markey, Ch. 2 Such images as bows and arrows, clubs, and indications of cannibalism would be closely intertwined with the artistic conception of the Americas as a reflection of the idealization of America as a place of savagery and tropical wilderness. At this time, America personified predominantly possessed elements associated with hot, tropical environs because of the regions of the Americas that had been explored first. These explored regions were mainly the tropical regions of Central and South America.Le Corbeiller, 210 Depictions of America included exotic background details, especially fauna unknown in Europe such as \\"the parrot or macaw, turtle, armadillo, tapir, sloth, jaguar, and alligator.\\" However, the tattoos worn by both sexes, which astonished early writers, were omitted by artists based in Europe, though drawn by travelers. They may have been thought indecorous on female personifications.Le Corbeiller, 210 While Europe possessed the image of a noble or a Roman goddess, America \\"was usually envisioned as a rather fierce savage ‚Äì only slightly removed in type from the medieval tradition of the wild man.\\"Le Corbeiller, 210 This is not to suggest that only America was radically different from Europe in terms of the figure‚Äôs appearance. Outside of personification, Asia took a dramatically different appearance from Europe. This is seen in the print The Entry of the Ambassador of Persia into Paris, Seen in the Place Royal, 7 February 1715. Coming from the ‚Äúvery exotic kingdom of Persia,‚Äù the plate depicts the Persian diplomat Mohammed Reza Beg with his entourage, almost all men with turbans, moustaches, distinctive noses, and robes, some bearing falchions. This does, however, argue that America was perhaps iconographically the most antithetical continent to Europe in most sets of the continents personified. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, fresco in the W√ºrzburg Residenz, 1750s. America sits on a huge alligator. This disparity between the two continents is especially poignant in the continental personifications at the staircase in W√ºrzburg. There, Europe is seen, in accordance with Ripa‚Äôs depiction, as being the most nobly clad, in addition to being surrounded by relics of art, science, and the church. This is opposed by the depiction of America as naked, dressed in feathers, with a feathered crown, a bow, a parrot perched on her wrist, accompanied by a pile of heads. In addition to these disparate degrees of civility in their depictions, here Europe and America are shown to be in a direct relationship of religious superiority and subservience. In describing the Americas in terms of religious potential with regards to the paintings at W√ºrzburg, it was argued about America that ‚ÄúOne of the foremost connotations of this new world was religious, and specifically missionary.‚Äù In spite of the predominant conception of America personified as being a half-clad woman wearing feathers, holding a bow, and having a large reptile at her side and a disembodied head at her feet, not all images of America were made strictly in accordance with what was essentially Ripa‚Äôs template for the continental personifications, nor did the cultural elements or wildlife depicted always stand up to what America‚Äôs reality actually was. Indeed, as time went on, instead of familiarity breeding authenticity in depictions, artistic license became even more rampant. ‚ÄúAs the New World became less threatening to Europeans, its personification grew softer, more decorative, more Arcadian. Amazons gave way to graceful young women, whom the European taste for exoticism endowed with an ever more voluptuous appeal.‚ÄùHigham, 50 By virtue of this, the depiction of America as a wild savage shifted into being a noble savage, or \\"Indian princess.\\"Higham, 50‚Äì51 In other, less politically-charged respects, there were also inconsistencies in America‚Äôs portrayal, particularly with the sort of animals accompanying her. Often Africa and America were confused, with their conventional attributes being swapped around; presumably this was because both were considered hot and exotic.Le Corbelier, 219 America has been shown with a number of animals not naturally found on the American continents. America is shown with a camel in a set of glasses, and a depiction of a woman with an elephant had been labelled ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù for many years. These inaccuracies were encompassed in a larger conundrum of America and Africa being allowed to share iconography, even within the same context, as in one instance where America‚Äôs and Africa‚Äôs personifications are portrayed as children in the act of playing with each other. Early North American images The first personification images made by Europeans settled in America included some versions of the European types, including engravings by Paul Revere, but such European-Americans were not long happy being symbolised by Native Americans, with whom they were often at war.Higham, 55‚Äì57 Before independence they had already begun to use figures combining aspects of Britannia and Liberty, and after it quickly dropped the former. The figures were now sometimes called \\"America\\" and sometimes \\"Liberty\\", later mostly settling on the latter. Through most of the 19th century American coins carried a neoclassical female head labelled \\"Liberty\\". Although Columbia was in literary use from around 1730, she does not seem to have been used in images until later, around 1800.Higham, 59‚Äì70 File:America, from the Four Continents MET DP861355.jpg|Engraving after Maerten de Vos, 16th century.

He emigrated to England in 1608 and built a reputation among the academic circles of England and Hungary, associating with such figures as the alchemist Arthur Dee, astrologer William Lilly, physician Jonathan Goddard and scientist Kenelm Digby Born in Nagyb√°nya, Hungary in 1576, Banfi Hunyades took an apprenticeship in goldsmithing in his hometown. Between 1606 and 1608 he took a journey through Europe, passing through Germany and arriving in England by 1608. Upon his arrival he became a successful goldsmith in London, visiting Hungary several times before settling in England upon his marriage to Dorothy Colton in 1619, to whom he had 4 children. Banfi Hunyades kept up his contacts with several eminent Hungarian figures and, in 1633, he was invited by the Prince of Transylvania to occupy a position at his planned academy. As of 1633, Banfi Hunyades took a position at Gresham College, lecturing and experimenting in chemistry with several eminent scientists at the College until as late as 1642. In 1646, before a planned trip with Arthur Dee to Hungary in search of antimony, Banfi Hunyades died on 28 August.  Biography  Banfi Hunyades was born in 1576 in Rivulus Dominarum (Nagyb√°nya), then part of the Kingdom of Hungary, now known as Baia Mare, Romania. He was born to Hungarian Calvinist priest and superintendent for Tisz√°nt√∫l, ., Benedek had written a text on the Bubonic plague in 1577 (Az mirigyhal√°lr√≥l val√≥ r√∂vid ker. √©rtelem), suggesting a family interest in science., His family was possibly descended from the noble Hunyadi family, more specifically King of Hungary Matthias Corvinus, though such reports aren't corroborated by any independent genealogical source other than his son's grave. It is more likely B√°nfihunyadi is a toponymic surname, based on Benedek's birthplace of B√°nffyhunyad (present-day Huedin, Romania)., , Municipal records of Baia Mare indicate Banfi Hunyades owned and operated a vineyard and pressing house. He became an apprentice of goldsmithing in his birthplace, working under a coiner. As of 1606, Banfi Hunyades was in Kassa (today Ko≈°ice in Slovakia), a popular destination for journeymen goldsmiths. He soon set of on a journey through Europe, possibly passing through Rudolf II's court in the Holy Roman Empire and the court of Maurice of Hesse-Kassel. Maurice of Hesse-Kassel's court was an epicenter of occult and alchemical activity in Europe at the time, with several English alchemists and natural philosophers visiting it., It is not definitely known that he passed through either country, but a later notebook reveals a method of transmutation which he attributes to 'a certain famous and generous Bohemian lord', alongside a reference to Edward Kelley, who worked in the court of Rudolf II. Banfi Hunyades was in Germany around 1608, where he bought a K√°roli Bible. Banfi Hunyades arrived to England in 1608, becoming a well off goldsmith in London, though he never joined the Goldsmith's Guild as he lived outside the City of London., In 1613, he sent a letter to his brother informing him of his position and wealth, promising to visit Nagyb√°nya the next year and asking him to take care of his books and instruments left in Hungary. He clearly kept close links to Hungary, conversing and corresponding in Hungarian with Hungarians in London and in his home country. On 5 July 1617, he donated a lavishly bound German edition of the Hungarian K√°roli Bible to the Bodleian upon a visit to Oxford, as a parting gift for a trip to Hungary., , , George Gomori has suggested that Banfi Hunyades was at Oxford to meet with Thomas Allen, as William Lilly later received a manuscript of Allen's from Banfi Hunyades., In 1619, Banfi Hunyades married Dorothy Colton, daughter of Sir Francis Colton of Kent. Presumably this limited his travel to Hungary, but he continued to keep up his contacts by corresponding in Hungarian with several eminent Hungarian scholars, such as and G√°bor Haller, with some even visiting him in London., Around this time it has been conjectured that Arthur Dee, son of John Dee, associated with Banfi Hunyades in a trip to Hungary in search of antimony, valued as an alchemical substance. This is evidenced by some suggestive passages in the manuscript of Arcana Arcanorum where Dee mentions sending a Hungarian friend to collect some \\"prima materia\\" (here referring to antimony), how he would not dare visit Hungary without this \\"faithful friend\\", alongside some lines echoing inscriptions on Banfi Hunyades' engraved portraits. Dee would later plan a trip to Hungary to collect antimony with Banfi Hunyades, though it fell through after Banfi Hunyades' death. In 1633, Prince of Transylvania George I R√°k√≥czi saw Banfi Hunyades fit to occupy a professorship at his planned academy in Kolozsv√°r (present-day Cluj-Napoca, Romania), being that he had experience within the English academic system and knowledge in chemistry., There is no evidence he accepted this position and by 1633 he was in the employ of Gresham College. Around 1633, Banfi Hunyades became the assistant of natural philosopher Kenelm Digby at Gresham College, though this position was not an official post for either of them and they were not paid for their work. Digby constructed a lab beneath the house of the Gresham Professor of Divinity where the two conducted botanical experiments. There is circumstantial evidence Digby sent Banfi Hunyades out on expeditions to Hungary in search of antimony, as he had allegedly done before with Dee. Hunyades also gave lectures in chemistry, one of which is recorded by John Webster, who studied under Banfi Hunyades, in his Metallographia (1671). He also worked with Gresham Professor of Physic, Jonathan Goddard; an experiment recorded in a notebook of Goddard's has been speculated by C. H. Josten and F. Sherwood Taylor to constitute the first record of temperature measurement in distillation., Banfi Hunyades may have had a position at the College as late as 1642., He erroneously claimed to be a professor in a letter to Medgyesi, and has since been misidentified as a professor of the College, but there are no records of him as such, and his marriage and field disqualified him from professorship., Banfi Hunyades' alchemical work was mostly preoccupied with the properties of mercury, the secrets of which he thought would reveal the secret of transmutation. He saw mercury as the prima materia of alchemy. According to William Lilly, in his dedicatication to Banfi Hunyades in Anglicus, peace, or no peace (1645), the Latin phrase \\"Est in Mercurio quicquid quaerunt sapientes\\" was Banfi Hunyades' motto, and the phrase is featured in all of his engraved portraits. An inscription on his portrait describes one such alchemical accomplishment of his, an experiment in which he destroyed gold and silver by way of mercury, reduced the resultant substance into mercury and precipitated the mercury into a red powder. He was clearly proud of the experiment, as it is inscribed on the frame of each of his engraved portraits ‚Äì based on a Gowy portrait showing him holding the vessel he used to perform the experiment. This alchemical preoccupation has been criticized with the biographer Reverend James Granger describing him as \\"far gone in his philosophical fanaticism\\" and Martyn Rady suggests the red powder was probably only oxidized mercury. His characterization as a purely alchemical figure by writers such as Granger, who called him a \\"smoke-dried mercurialist\\", has been criticized by some Modern scholars. Schultheisz and Tardy claimed that, in his experiments, \\"the ingredients of the prescriptions, the chemical techniques applied, the methods of preparation all doubtlessly prove that B√°nfihunyadi must have been a true chemist\\". In 1646, Arthur Dee, a lifelong devotee of the search for the philosopher's stone, made plans with Banfi Hunyades in London to meet in Amsterdam and travel to Hungary in search of antimony. Antimony was professed by several alchemists, notably Basil Valentine, as being a prima materia and the purest form was thought to be found in from Hungary. This followed several conjectured trips of Banfi Hunyades to Hungary in search of Antimony, though this is the only trip there exists hard evidence of. Dee and Banfi Hunyades were known to have associated before this point, with their experiments together weighing heavily on Dee's wealth. Banfi Hunyades died suddenly on 28 August 1646 at the age of 70 in Amsterdam, where he was to meet Dee, destroying his plans of returning to Hungary with Dee. Though not a wealthy man for most of his life, Banfi Hunyades died with a reasonably large fortune; as of September 1644, his son Johannes was made sole heir of his possessions, making quite a large sum of money as the manager of his estate., , His place of burial is unknown. Banfi Hunyades and Dorothy had four children. Two of his children, Johannes (1621‚Äì1696) and Elizabeth (1620‚Äì1710), have large memorials in the crypt of St. Leonard's, Shoreditch. Johannes was educated in the Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood, beginning as the alchemist of Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke, but ending as a rich usurer of poor reputation in London. His grave claims the, likely erroneous, descendance from the Hunyadi family.,  Historical investigation  Johannes Banfi Hunyades never published anything during his lifetime, and his entire Nachlass consists of only a few inscriptions, letters and experimental notes surviving from his lifetime. The fact that, through the 20th-century, Anglophone and Hungarian scholars have been able to piece together the life of a relatively obscure Hungarian alchemist from contemporary comments, manuscript notes and municipal records has been described by Martyn Rady as \\"a comment on the extent of the archival and literary sources which survive [...] after almost three and a half centuries\\". There are five extant contemporary portraits of Banfi Hunyades. Four of these portraits are contemporary engravings based on a lost painting of Jacob Peter Gowy, three by Wenceslaus Hollar, all dated to 1644, and one by William Marshall, dated 1646. The engraved portraits show Banfi Hunyades bearded and elderly, holding the glass vessel which he utilized in his mercurial experiments., The engraved portraits are all enclosed within a frame of alchemical quotations and biographical inscriptions on Banfi Hunyades, revealing his preoccupation with alchemy, mathematics and mercury as well as his birthplace of Nagyb√°nya. Beneath the frame of the engravings is the monas sign, as described by John Dee in his Monas Hieroglyphica and each engraving is flanked by scientific instruments and alchemical symbols. The Hollar engravings with compass and protractor on the left and retort, alembic and curcubit on the right; the Marshall engraving supported by figures of Sol, Luna and Mercury. These engravings were the first evidence used by Josten and Taylor in their original biographical investigation into Banfi Hunyades. The fifth extant portrait of Banfi Hunyades was discovered by Hungarian medical historian, , in 1929 during research for his historical work, Ungarische Medizinische Erinnerungen. The portrait, in the collection of Dr Geza Faludy as of 1929, is a small silver medallion struck in 1645. The portrait has similarities to the engraved portraits in its borders, populated with alchemical imagery, but on the whole the medallion is very different. The medallion shows Hunyades in profile with a full head of hair, beard and small medallion. He is crowned with Latin text giving his name and birthplace, alongside his age of 69 at the foot. Around 1977, Hungarian academic George Gomori, during a survey of Hungarian Bibles in Oxford, discovered a note about a (the second edition of the Vizsoly Bible) sold by the Bodleian Library to Christ Church Library around 1676. The beautifully bound 1608 German edition of the Bible was found to contain an inscription from none other than Banfi Hunyades himself. The inscription begins with the first gold lettered page, signed with a date of 1617 and the initials of Banfi Hunyades (H x I x NB for Hunyadinus Iohannes Nagyb√°nya). The following page has a verse Latin poem, entitled Ad Antiquissimam et Celeberimam Academiam Oxoniensem, and a short Latin inscription giving some biographical information on Banfi Hunyades; describing himself as an \\"aurifaber\\" (i.e. a goldsmith and alchemist) and the son of \\"Benedick Banfi Huniadinus\\"., The Hungarian inscription on the page after describes his giving of the book to \\"the Oxford Library, to be remembered forever\\" on 15 July 1617. This inscription gives the definite date for his arrival to England as 1608, describing how in 1617 he had \\"lived here in England for 9 years\\".  In popular culture  In 2016, Walter √úbelhart (an author of Baia Mare) published √én umbra lui Shakespeare: Un roman istoric din Transilvania (published in English as In Shakespeare's Shadow: A novel from Transylvania), a multilingual alternate history novel with Banfi Hunyades as the protagonist. The novel speculatively characterises Banfi Hunyades as a contemporary and friend of William Shakespeare, who offered Shakespeare advice but preferred to stay in the shadows of history.

It grows only on limestone slopes in the Wuling Mountains, 300 to 1200m above sea level. It is similar to Prunus cerasoides but is genetically and morphologically distinct. It has been given the nominal common name Sun Hang cherry () in honor of the botanist Hang Sun. Description Prunus sunhangii are trees 20 to 25m tall. They resemble P. cerasoides but can be distinguished from them by a number of features. P. sunhangii leaf margins are apex acuminate whereas P. cerasoides leaf margins are apex acuminate to long acuminate. P. sunhangii sepal margins are laxly dentate but P. cerasoides sepals are entire. P. sunhangii petals are longitudinally 2lobed while P. cerasoides petals are emarginate. P. sunhangii flowers have 17 to 25 stamens and P. cerasoides flowers have 32 to 34 stamens. There are color differences; all P. sunhangii individuals observed have white petals, but some P. cerasoides have pink petals (others have white). P. sunhangii hypanthia are brown, P. cerasoides hypanthia are red through dark red. P. sunhangii drupes are black when ripe, P. cerasoides drupes are purplishblack. Distribution Prunus sunhangii has a disjunct distribution from P. cerasoides. P. sunhangii is found only in association with the relict stands of Metasequoia glyptostroboides of Hunan and Hubei provinces but the more widely distributed P. cerasoides is never found there. The area of occupancy of P. sunhangii is only about 75 km2, so it should be considered endangered under the rules of the IUCN.

It derives from the traditional Shetland Pony from the Shetland Isles of Scotland, but as a result of cross-breeding with other horse and pony breeds, is taller and more elegant. It does not have the thick coat of the traditional Shetland, and in conformation is more similar to the Hackney Pony, with some Arab influence. It is the most numerous pony breed in the United States; numbers in 1994 were estimated at over 50,000. It is one of two American pony breeds derived from the traditional Shetland, the other being the Pony of the Americas.  History  A stallion imported to the United States by Eli Elliot The first documented importation of Shetland Ponies to the United States was in 1885, when Eli Elliot imported seventy-five of them. A breed association, the American Shetland Pony Club, was formed in 1888. The original stock was crossbred with various other breeds, principally the Hackney Pony. Arabian, Harness Show Pony and Welsh breeds were also used. The result was a taller and more elegant pony than the classic Shetland, with longer legs and finer bone, high withers and a sloping shoulder, and a high action particularly well-suited to harness work. It does not have the thick coat of the traditional Shetland, but supposedly retains the hardiness and endurance of that breed; in conformation it is more similar to the Hackney Pony, also showing some Arab influence. It is the most numerous pony breed in the United States; numbers in 1994 were estimated at over 50,000. It is one of two American pony breeds derived from the traditional Shetland, the other being the Pony of the Americas. It was the principal influence on another Shetland-derived breed, the German Classic Pony. American Shetland Ponies may be registered in the American Shetland Pony Club stud book, in one of four sections: foundation, classic, modern, and modern pleasure; they are distinguished by minor variations in conformation, the \\"foundation\\" type being the smallest and most similar to the American Shetland of the 1950s. In the past, American Shetlands were registered in section B of the stud book, and the traditional Shetland Pony in section A.  Use  The American Shetland Pony is well-suited to harness use. It may be used as a roadster to pull sulkies, or in fine harness pulling two-wheeled or four-wheeled carts. It may be ridden under either a Western or English saddle, and is also shown at Halter.

The area of Bugojno was under joint control of the ARBiH 307th Brigade and the HVO Eugen Kvaternik Brigade since the start of the Bosnian War. Violent incidents in Bugojno followed the escalation of the Croat-Bosniak War in adjacent municipalities throughout the 1st half of 1993. Bugojno was spared from fighting and the two local brigades were still formally allied by June 1993, at the time of an ARBiH offensive in central Bosnia. Fighting broke out in the town on 18 July. The HVO forces, outnumbered by three to one, were separated and surrounded in several locations. Most of them were defeated within a week of intense street combat. The last HVO units in the town surrendered on 25 July, while combat in the rest of the municipality lasted for another four days. The ARBiH won control over the entire municipality. Its casualties were 92 killed and 211 wounded, while the HVO had 107 killed, 130 wounded and 470 captured. The Eugen Kvaternik Brigade was effectively destroyed in the battle. An estimated 15,000 Croats fled. Several hundred HVO POWs and civilians were detained in various prison camps in the town, including the Iskra Stadium. The last prisoners were released in March 1994. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina convicted four ARBiH officials and one HVO official for war crimes committed during and after the battle. The Court charged the ARBiH authorities in Bugojno for participating in a joint criminal enterprise against Croat detainees, a qualification that was dropped on appeal. Background The town of Bugojno in 1996 At the beginning of the Bosnian War, the area of Bugojno, a town and municipality in central Bosnia situated on the river Vrbas, was under joint control of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the main Croat army, and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), the main Bosniak army. The two armies cooperated against the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). Bugojno was at the crossroads of two important routes linking the central part of the country with the region of Herzegovina and leading further to Croatia. A weapons factory in the town produced mines and hand grenades. Before the war, the municipality of Bugojno had a population of 46,889, of which 42% were Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), 34% were Croats, and 18% were Serbs. The town of Bugojno had 22,641 citizens, with the percentage of Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs each being 30%. In the 1990 municipal election, the municipality elected 21 delegates of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH), 20 delegates of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), and 9 delegates of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS). The elected mayor was a Croat from the HDZ BiH. The ethnic balance in the municipality changed significantly in 1992. Most Serbs fled at the start of the Bosnian War, while a large number of Bosniak and Croat refugees moved in from other parts of the country. The HVO and the Bosnian Territorial Defence Force, later transformed into the ARBiH, established a defence system in Bugojno early in the war. Bugojno was within the area of responsibility of the Yugoslav People's Army's (JNA) 19th Partisan Brigade of the 30th Partisan Division. Several assaults by the JNA, which later became the VRS, were repelled by the HVO and the ARBiH throughout 1992. The VRS held the adjacent municipalities of Donji Vakuf and Kupres, which was captured by the JNA in April. In October 1992, a series of incidents led to open fighting between the HVO and the ARBiH in Novi Travnik, east of Bugojno. The local HVO in Bugojno reached an agreement with the local ARBiH not to send their forces outside of the municipality. The road towards Novi Travnik was blocked. On 26 October, a ceasefire was signed in Bugojno between HVO and ARBiH representatives. The clashes in October are generally regarded as the start of the Croat-Bosniak War. Despite the outbreak of hostilities, the conflict remained localized and a general military alliance was still in effect. Relations between Croats and Bosniaks in Bugojno were relatively good until January 1993, when the HVO and the ARBiH clashed in Gornji Vakuf, southeast of Bugojno. Local commanders tried to preserve the alliance by allowing the free movement of each other's troops, but relations continued to deteriorate. Opposing forces Bugojno was within the area of responsibility of the HVO Operative Zone Northwest Herzegovina. The HVO Eugen Kvaternik Brigade, established in May 1992, was based in Bugojno and was organized into three battalions, a military police company, and a small mixed artillery battery. It was under the command of Ivica Luƒçiƒá and had an estimated strength of 1,000 to 1,500 soldiers. Prior to the conflict with the ARBiH, the brigade included around 200 Bosniaks in its ranks. The ARBiH assigned the municipality of Bugojno to the 3rd Corps. In March 1993, 3rd Corps Commander Enver Had≈æihasanoviƒá reorganized its brigades into four Operational Groups (OG), including the OG West with headquarters in Bugojno. The OG West was commanded by Selmo Cikotiƒá. Its 307th Mountain Brigade, organized into 4 battalions, was based in Bugojno, under the command of Tahir Graniƒá. Fully mobilized, the brigade could field around 3-3,500 troops with several dozen mortars. Senad Dautoviƒá was the head of the Unified Command of the ARBiH Bugojno. Prelude Territorial changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina since January 1993, also showing the area of Bugojno The Croat-Bosniak War was raging in central Bosnia in April and in Herzegovina in May 1993. In June 1993, the ARBiH started an offensive against the HVO in central Bosnia, defeating the HVO in Travnik and most of the Novi Travnik municipality, northeast of Bugojno. The 307th Bugojno Mountain Brigade assisted other ARBiH units in the fighting in Novi Travnik. The ARBiH's objective was to secure the road that connected the VRS-held Jajce and Donji Vakuf, the contested Bugojno and Gornji Vakuf, HVO-held Prozor, ARBiH-held Jablanica, and continued south to Mostar. Control of the Slavko Rodiƒá weapons factory in Bugojno, damaged earlier in the war but still functional, was also of strategic importance. By June 1993, the ARBiH and the HVO still jointly controlled the checkpoints in and around Bugojno. The units split in July. By that time, a number of violent incidents by extremists on both sides increased ethnic tensions. The ethnic unrest culminated in two events: the torching of the Bosniak village of Vrbanja, resulting in many casualties, and the killing of two Croat policemen who were members of the joint patrol. Battle The Kalin Hotel in Bugojno, the last large HVO pocket of resistance The battle began on the morning of 18 July with an ARBiH 307th Brigade attack on the HVO Eugen Kvaternik Brigade. Since a large number of HVO soldiers were on leave of deployed outside of Bugojno, the actual fighting strength of the HVO was estimated at no more than 200-400 in the town. After several days of fierce street fighting, the ARBiH put under control most of the key facilities in the town, including the HVO Eugen Kvaternik Brigade's barracks. The HVO forces were separated into three locations. The HVO's 3rd battalion was surrounded in the town's elementary school. It surrendered on 23 July, followed by the 1st and 2nd battalion. The HVO military police company, surrounded in the Kalin hotel, was the last large pocket of resistance until it surrendered on 25 July. The fighting continued southeast of the town and lasted until 29 July. Aftermath The ARBiH casualties were 92 killed and 211 wounded. The HVO had 107 killed and 130 wounded. According to a September 1993 report by OG West, 470 \\"HVO members\\" were captured in the course of the fighting. The report noted that 383 had the status of prisoners of war, while 66 were released. The other 87 prisoners, who were not listed as prisoners of war, were considered irregular combatants by the ARBiH. Around 15,000 Croats fled from the municipality. The remnants of the Eugen Kvaternik Brigade were regrouped into a single battalion and later combined with the HVO Kupres and Jajce brigades into the 55th Home Guard Regiment. From July 1993, the HVO's Operative Zone Central Bosnia was completely cut off from the HVO in Herzegovina and could not receive any significant amounts of military supplies. After the capture of Bugojno, the ARBiH continued its offensive towards Gornji Vakuf on 1 August, around 20 kilometers to the southeast, and captured most of the HVO-held part of the municipality. The HVO made a counterattack with limited success. The confrontation line soon stabilized, running through the town of Gornji Vakuf. War crimes and prosecution Bosniak civilians from the settlement of Vrbanja and other parts of the municipality were detained in the \\"Akvarijum\\" motel in Bugojno during the battle. The arrests were conducted by the HVO's Special Purpose Unit Garavi. The prisoners were abused and beaten, while one prisoner was killed. Several hundred HVO soldiers and Croat civilians, captured during the battle, were detained by the ARBiH in various detention facilities in Bugojno, where they were subjected to physical abuse. The longest open detention facility was the Iskra Stadium, which was turned into a detention camp in August 1993. Around 300 Croat prisoners were detained there for eight months. They were taken to perform forced labor and used as human shields. The camp operated until 19 March 1994, when it numbered 292 detainees. At least 24 prisoners of the detention facilities in Bugojno were killed. After the war, the SFOR estimated in 1997 that the ethnic composition of the municipality was 38,000 (94%) Bosniaks, 2,000 (5%) Croats and 400 (1%) Serbs. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) filed several indictments on war crime charges committed during and after the battle. In the trial against Amir Kubura and Enver Had≈æihasanoviƒá, former Commander of the ARBiH 3rd Corps, the ICTY convicted Had≈æihasanoviƒá in the first instance verdict in March 2006, inter alia, for failing to take adequate measures to prevent crimes against the detainees in Bugojno. The Appeals Chamber reversed some of the Trial Chamber's findings, including counts related to Bugojno, and reduced his sentence to three and a half years in April 2008. Slavko ≈†akiƒá, member of the Special Purpose Unit Garavi of the HVO, pleaded guilty to plunder, torture of Bosniak prisoners and the killing of one prisoner. He was convicted in September 2008 to 8 years and 6 months of imprisonment by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Enes Hand≈æiƒá, Assistant Commander for Security of the ARBiH 307th Brigade, was sentenced to eight years in prison by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 2011, after he had pleaded guilty to forcing detainees to perform labor and for not taking necessary measures to prevent crimes against the detainees. In November 2011, in the first instance verdict of the Nisvet Gasal et al. trial, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina convicted Senad Dautoviƒá, head of the ARBiH Bugojno, to 13 years in prison, and Nisvet Gasal, warden of the Iskra Stadium camp, to 6 years. The Court ruled that Senad Dautoviƒá participated in a joint criminal enterprise against detainees of Croat ethnicity. According to the verdict, the joint criminal enterprise involved the Bugojno Municipality Wartime Presidency, with D≈æevad Mlaƒáo as the Chairman, the Bugojno Defence Staff, the 307th Brigade of the ARBiH, and Operations Group West of the ARBiH. The trial verdict was revoked in December 2012 and a re-trial before the Appellate Division was ordered. In December 2013, the Appellate Division of the Court of BiH reduced Dautoviƒá's sentence to seven years and Nisvet Gasal's to four years, while Musajb Kukavic, Security Commander at the Iskra Stadium, was sentenced to four years.

A Union Army veteran of the American Civil War, Grigsby was most notable for his service as South Dakota Attorney General and an organizer and commander of the 3rd United States Volunteer Cavalry Regiment during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Early life Melvin Grigsby was born in the town of Potosi, Wisconsin on June 8, 1845 to William Etchison Grigsby and Rhoda (Thomas) Grigsby. At the time of Grigsby's birth, his father worked as a lead miner, but when Grigsby was four, his family relocated to a farm near Potosi village. Grigsby was raised to do farm work while he received his early education in the village's public schools. As a teenager, he attended Lancaster Institute, a private academy in Lancaster, Wisconsin. Civil War In September 1861, Cadwallader C. Washburn visited Lancaster to recruit soldiers for the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry. Grigsby obtained his father's consent and enlisted as a private in the regiment's Company C. Grigsby took part in several of the 2nd Wisconsin's engagements in and around Vicksburg, Mississippi and attained the rank of sergeant. On March 8, 1864, he was captured near the Big Black River and held as a prisoner of war. Grigsby spent a short amount of time at a prison camp in Canton, Mississippi, then was transferred to Cahaba Prison (Alabama), followed by transfer to Andersonville Prison (Georgia), and finally Florence Stockade in South Carolina. The majority of Grigsby's time as a POW, more than six months, was spent at Andersonville. Grigsby escaped once, but was quickly recaptured. On January 10, 1865, he escaped from Florence Stockade. Having been apprised of the Union Army's progress through updates from newly-captured soldiers brought into the prison, Grigsby decided to proceed south in hopes of meeting up with units of William T. Sherman‚Äôs force that was then in Savannah, Georgia as part of Sherman's March to the Sea. Grigsby reached Union lines on February 1, and remained with Sherman's troops until they reached Goldsboro, North Carolina in March. Post-Civil War Grigsby was discharged at the end of the war and returned to Wisconsin. He attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for a year, then transferred to the Platteville Normal School, from which he graduated in 1869. After completing his education, Grigsby was a teacher and principal at the high school in Horicon, Wisconsin for a year, then served in a similar position at the high school in Darlington, Wisconsin. He was principal of the elementary school in Delavan, Wisconsin from 1871 to 1872. Grigsby studied law while teaching school, and completed his studies under attorney William Pitt Dewey of Lancaster. He attained admission to the bar in the summer of 1872 and then undertook a trip to find a location in the Northwestern United States where he could establish a legal practice. Move to South Dakota In late June 1872, Grigsby arrived in Sioux Falls, Dakota Territory and decided to remain. He entered into a law practice and land selling partnership with Richard F. Pettigrew, which they maintained for four years. In 1877, Grigsby went into banking as the partner of George M. Smith, and they owned and operated the Bank of Egan, and later the Union Bank of Elk Point, both of which Grigsby served as the first president. Grigsby also became active in politics as a Republican, and served for two years as clerk of the courts for Minnehaha County, and two terms as a Sioux Falls city alderman. In 1886, Grigsby nearly won the party's nomination for Delegate to Congress, and later that year he won a term in the territorial House of Representatives. In the mid 1890s, Grigsby became an advocate of the free silver position with respect to US monetary policy, as well as other reform movements that led to the creation of the People's Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the South Dakota Senate in 1894, but in 1896, he ran successfully for South Dakota Attorney General, defeating the nominees of the Republican and Prohibition parties. As attorney general, Grigsby was responsible for ending the investigation into supposedly missing funds in the office of the State Auditor. After reviewing the allegations of the public examiner who made the charges, Grigsby reported that there were enough errors and inconsistencies in the allegations that he would decline to prosecute the current auditor and his predecessor.

At the start of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Grigsby offered his services to the federal government and volunteered to raise a cavalry unit from South Dakota and nearby states. Learning that Congress was considering legislation to allow the formation of volunteer regiments, he traveled to Washington, D.C. and succeeded in securing passage of an amendment that allowed for the raising of three cavalry regiments. As a result, the 1st Cavalry (Rough Riders) under Leonard Wood and Theodore Roosevelt, 2nd Cavalry (Rocky Mountain Riders) under Jay L. Torrey, and 3rd Cavalry (Grigsby's Cowboys) under Grigsby were recruited, organized and trained. Grigsby commanded his regiment as a colonel during May and June 1898, which included its organization and training at Camp Thomas, Georgia. He was then promoted to command of 1st Cavalry Brigade, First Army Corps as an acting brigadier general, and he continued to lead the brigade until the end of the war. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War ended without the need for the 1st Cavalry Brigade to deploy overseas, and they were mustered out in September, 1899. Grigsby remained interested in military service; in 1900, he offered to re- form his regiment and lead it to China to protect U.S. interests during the Boxer Rebellion. In 1904, he offered to raise a volunteer regiment to aid Japan during the Russo-Japanese War. Neither proposal was acted on by federal authorities. Later career By 1900, Grigsby had returned to the Republican Party, in part because of a longstanding feud with Governor and Populist leader Andrew E. Lee. In May, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt nominated Grigsby as United States Attorney for the Territory of Alaska‚Äôs second judicial district, based in Nome. He was confirmed in June, and served until resigning in May, 1904. Grigsby's tenure was controversial ‚Äì he had not been recommended for the position by South Dakota's congressional delegation, and he was later reprimanded by the Attorney General for spending part of the winter of 1903 outside Alaska despite explicit instructions not to leave. In January 1904, Grigsby was accused of accepting a $10,000 bribe disguised as a legal fee in exchange for foregoing prosecution of an Alaska oil company. He was exonerated of the bribery charge in March, and resigned in May, to be effective beginning in July. Grigsby claimed that he was being supplanted because of favoritism and that he had taken the position in Alaska only to help one his sons, George Barnes Grigsby, establish a career of his own in Alaska. In fact, Grisby's successor was Henry M. Hoyt, a cousin of the U.S. Solicitor General, also named Henry M. Hoyt. In addition, George Grigsby, who had served as his father's Assistant U.S. Attorney, continued in the same position under Hoyt, and later served as U.S. Attorney himself. Grigsby continued to practice law in Sioux Falls, and remained interested in politics, including attending Theodore Roosevelt's 1905 inauguration. In addition, he was a sought-after public speaker, and was frequently called on to provide orations at Independence Day and Memorial Day commemorations and other public events. In 1912, Grigsby was a supporter of Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive candidacy for president. He remained in the Republican Party and was a candidate for U.S. Senator, but lost the Republican nomination to Thomas Sterling, a fellow Roosevelt Republican who went on to win the general election. When conflict between factions in the Mexican Civil War led to the possibility of U.S. military action to defend the U.S.-Mexico border, Grigsby offered to raise a volunteer force and lead it to Texas, but the federal government relied on mobilized National Guard units rather than volunteers to perform this mission. In 1916, Grigsby was again a supporter of Roosevelt for president, and ran unsuccessfully for delegate to the Republican National Convention. Death and burial In 1916, Grigsby was diagnosed with anemia, and he spent time at a sanitorium in Battle Creek, Michigan to receive treatment. In January 1917, Grigsby announced a new law firm with his son John as his partner, and published accounts indicated he was also active in founding and managing the Stockyards Bank of Sioux Falls. He became ill later that month, and was diagnosed with pneumonia in addition to his anemic condition. He decided to travel to Birmingham, Alabama in the hopes that a warmer climate might prove restorative, but his health continued to decline, and he died in Birmingham on February 15, 1917. Grigsby was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Sioux Falls. Family In March 1873, Grigsby married Fannie Lou Kingsbury (1847-1924) in Delavan, Wisconsin. They were the parents of Sioux, George, Fannie, and John. Sioux K. Grigsby served in both houses of the South Dakota legislature, and was lieutenant governor from 1945 to 1949. George Barnes Grigsby served as U.S. Attorney in Nome, Alaska, Nome's mayor, Alaska Territory's first attorney general, and as Alaska Territory's Delegate to Congress. Fannie Lou Grigsby (1888-1985) married George Edwin Robinson. She was a professional musician, and after graduating from Chicago Musical College, she taught at Wheaton College and was the piano accompanist for the Chicago Opera Company. John T. Grigsby was a South Dakota attorney and politician, and served as lieutenant governor from 1929 to 1931.

Begun perhaps around 1245, it received its definitive form in Latin around 1493, a French translation in 1500, and its most expansive and well- known French edition in 1703. Its original Latin title, Liber Secretorum Alberti Magni virtutibus herbarum, lapidum and animalium quorumdam, translates to English as \\"the book of secrets of Albert the Great on the virtues of herbs, stones and certain animals\\". It is also known under the names of The Secrets of Albert, Secreta Alberti, and Experimenta Alberti. Bibliographer Jacques-Charles Brunet described it as being \\"among popular books, the most famous and perhaps the most absurd.... It is only natural that the Book of Secrets was attributed to Albert the Great, because this doctor, very learned for his time, had, among his contemporaries, the reputation of being a sorcerer.\\" This book is often accompanied by another, similar text, the Petit Albert, which has been called its \\"little brother\\". Its title is Alberti Parvi Lucii Libellus Mirabilibus Naturae Arcanis, or the \\"Book of the marvelous secrets of Little Albert\\". There are recipes taken from Gerolamo Cardano (De subtilitate, 1552) and Giambattista Della Porta (Magia Naturalis, 1598), and there is an original chapter on talismans. Contents English text, The Secrets of Albertus Magnus The traditional French version, Les admirables secrets d'Albert le Grand, was published in Cologne in 1703. It contains the following parts: Epistle Excerpts: *\\"The subject of this book is a moving Being, applied to the knowledge of the secret parts of women, so that, when sick, we can provide them with the proper remedies to heal them, and that by confessing them, they should be given penances proportionate to the sins which they have committed.\\" *\\"ALBERT THE GREAT divides this book into two parts; in the first, he writes to one of his friends; and in the second, he sat at the request of a priest who urged him to learn something about the secrets of women, because they are so full of corruption, when they are left to themselves, that from their view they poison the animals, infect the children [when babies] in swaddling clothes, stain the cleanest mirror; finally, give the pox or plague to those who know them during this time.\\" Book One (12 chapters) *The first book is about the \\"secrets of women\\" and is called \\"De secretis mulierum\\". According to Alexandre Colson (1880), these are notes taken from a course of Albertus Magnus (about 1245‚Äì1248) on embryology and gynecology, which would become Book IX of De animalibus (1258). The publisher Joannes Quadrat added this to the text of the Grand Albert in 1580. It focuses on the generation of the embryo, on celestial influences, and on the signs of pregnancy. He also speaks bluntly about female sexuality. Excerpts: \\"The body is created and formed of the embryo by the effects and operations of the stars [so-called] planets.... If the belly grows and becomes round on the right side, it is a boy.\\" Two versions exist, one brief (De regimine sanitatis, or \\"the guide of health\\"), by Jean de S√©ville Hispalenis Hispalenis (about 1145), the other long, by Philippe de Tripoli (about 1250). Book Two (Three chapters) *Virtues of Planets, Stones and Certain Animals (Latin: De virtutibus herbarum, lapidum and animalium qurundam) or Experiences of Albert (Experimenta Alberti). These are pieces by Albert the Great, from De Mineralibus, 1256, according to Lynn Thorndike, gathered on the theme of occult powers. Extracts: \\"The seventh [herb] is from Venus, it is called \\"pisterion\\" or \\"verbena,\\" its root placed on the neck heals scrofula, parotid infections, ulcers and loss of urine.... If we want to become wise and avoid being foolish, one only has to take a stone called \\"chrysolite.\\" *Wonders of the World (Latin: De mirabilibus mundi). These are quotes from Greek, Arab, and Jewish works, which could be traced back to the reviews of Albert the Great, a great reader. Excerpts: \\"All that is called a 'wonderful and supernatural thing' and which is vulgarly called 'magic' comes from the affections of the will or some celestial influence at certain particular hours.... Every being communicates to all things to which it is joined with its virtues and its natural properties, as we see in the lion, who is an intrepid and naturally bold animal, because if someone carries his eye or his heart or the skin between his eyes he will become courageous, fearless, and terrify all other animals.\\" Book Three * \\"The wonderful and natural secrets\\". These are from the natural history of Pliny the Elder, giving magical recipes in his famous book on magic and occult pharmacopoeia. Added by the publisher Bernard du Mont du Chat in 1500, again by Oudot in 1604, and in 1706. *\\"Virtues and properties of several kinds of droppings\\". This chapter contains excerpts from Dioscorides, Galen, and Paul of Aegina on the occult virtues of some excrement, mud, and soot. It was added to the text in the 1706 edition. *\\"Proven Secrets to Handling Multiple Metals.\\" Extract: \\"To make knives, clasps, etc. harder. Cool your knives in the marrow of a horse.\\" Book Four This book is in two parts: Physiognomy and Procreation. It was added to the Grand Albert in 1508 by the aforementioned publisher Quadrat and in the 1706 edition. *De secretis naturae by Michael Scot *Physiognomy ‚Äì Physiognomonia (1203) *De hominis procreatione (Procreation in Man) ‚Äì added in the 1706 edition *Happy or Unhappy Days. This treaty offers an almanac. *Le Preparatif des Fi√®vres malignes (The Preparative of Malignant Fevers). This part takes elements from the physician Serenus Sammonicus of the third century. * \\"The regime of life\\" (Regimen vitae). \\"Des secrets des femmes\\" (or \\"The Secrets of Women\\"). This treatise is attributed to Benedictus Canuti, bishop in 1461. Advice to the Reader / Thoughts of the Prince of the Philosophers These two sections were added to the text after the edition published in 1703. The \\"Prince of the Philosophers\\" refers to Aristotle. Medieval editions A page from Les admirables secrets d'Albert Le Grand printed in the first half of the 19th century The core of the book was written in the 13th century. *The first known Latin edition dates back to 1493: Albertus Magnus, Liber aggregationis, Seu Liberetta secretorum of virtutibus herbarum lapidum and animalium quorundam.

A derivative of the Futura produced from 1999-2011 was the Magiq. The model was built for many years by the former BOVA company as the Bova Futura, and after that business was taken over by the VDL Groep as the VDL Bova Futura. In the autumn of 2010 a significantly facelifted version was introduced as the VDL Futura (sometimes referred to as the Futura 2).  Bova Futura  The Futura was introduced in September 1982 by its original manufacturer BOVA, as successor to the previous Europa model. In contrast to the angular lines of the Europa, the Futura featured a very distinctive convex aerodynamic front which inspired the model's name (futura being Spanish and Italian for \\"future\\"). The prominent \\"bulge\\" below the windscreen remained a feature of the Futura through successive facelifts until the introduction of the Futura 2 model in 2010.  Engines  From its introduction the Futura was available with DAF engines as standard, although Mercedes-Benz engines could be specified as an optional alternative. In 1994 Cummins and MAN engines became available as options, however all of the non-DAF engine options were dropped when the Euro 3 emission standards came into effect in 2000. The engine manufacturer is signified by the third letter of the detailed model code - for example a 12m high-floor coach could be coded FHD12 (DAF engine), FHM12 (Mercedes-Benz), FHC12 (Cummins) or FHX12 (MAN).  Height and Length Variations  Production commenced in 1982 with a 12 metre long coach available in two different heights - the 3.55m high FH12 and the 3.26m high FL12. The high floor versions were always the more numerous types. In 1990 the range was expanded with the introduction of a shorter (10.4m long) version of the high floor coach, the FH10. A third length option for the two-axle Futura coach was added in 1996, this being the 12.7m long FH13/FL13. An interurban bus/semi- coach version of the Futura was introduced in 1990 as the 12m long/3.08m high FV12, of which 169 were built during the 1990s. Three-axle coach variants of the Futura were built from 1993 onwards, marketed as the Futura Magnum. The 14.8m long FH15/FL15 were launched at Busworld in Kortrijk, whilst the 13.5m long (high floor only) FH14 was added to the range in 1995. The tri-axle variants of the Bova Futura were discontinued from 2007 following the introduction of tri-axle versions of the Bova Magiq. Towards the end of the original Bova Futura's production run the type codes were revised to more accurately reflect the length of the vehicle. Thus the FHD/FLD10, 12 and 13 became known as the FHD/FLD104, 120 and 127 respectively.  Facelifts  The Bova Futura was subject to several facelifts over the years, with the style of headlights providing the most immediately recognisable visual difference between vehicles of different phases. However identifying the age of individual vehicles by this method is now complicated as many older coaches have retrospectively been fitted with newer style front panels to modernise their appearance or repair accident damage. * 1982 - large circular quad headlamps, with each pair located in a rectangular recess near the bottom corners of the coach front. * 1988 - small rectangular quad headlamps in individual recesses positioned very slightly higher up the coach front, with similar fog lamps in the corners below. * 1999 - small circular quad headlights with smaller circular indicators/turn signals alongside, all in individual recesses and positioned higher up the coach front than both earlier versions. Small circular fog lamps in lower corners. * 2007 - as above but with the headlights and turn signals moved closer together and grouped together in a single irregularly-shaped recess on each side. This version also has a slightly less bulbous frontal profile. After the introduction of the VDL Futura 2 in 2010, the final version of the Bova Futura remained available for a time as a cheaper alternative marketed as the VDL Futura Classic.  Bova Magiq  From 1999 Bova offered the differently-styled Bova Magiq as a flagship model, which sold in more modest quantities than the Futura. Differences from the Futura included a flatter front profile, but a more curvaceous rear. Initially the Magiq was available as a two-axle coach (models XHD120 and XHD122), but from 2006 the model code changed to MHD and tri-axle MHD131, MHD139 and MHD148 variants were introduced as replacements for the Futura Magnum. The Magiq was facelifted for the 2007 model year, changes to the headlamps mirroring those of the contemporary Futura (although the headlamp clusters on the Magiq were positioned significantly higher on the body than those of the Futura). The Magiq was discontinued after the introduction of the VDL Futura 2.  VDL Futura 2  An extensively restyled Futura was launched by VDL Bus & Coach on 7 September 2010. The new model was henceforth marketed exclusively as a VDL , with the \\"Bova\\" name being discontinued. Also discontinued was the distinctive convex bulge on the front of the coach, as the new Futura 2 has a more upright frontal profile which owes more to the styling of the Magiq than to that of the previous Futura. The revised Futura was named International Coach of the Year 2012 on 29 August 2011. The single-deck VDL Futura is available in two heights, 3.5m (FMD2 variants) and 3.7m (FHD2 variants). Six length options are available for the FHD2 - 10.6m, 12.2m, 12.9m or 13.5m on two axles, and 13.9m or 14.8m on three- axles, whilst the lower FMD2 is only available in 12.9m, 13.5m and 14.8m lengths. Detailed model codes include the length of the vehicle, thus FHD2-122 denotes a 12.2m high-floor Futura 2. In 2015 the Futura range was extended to include the VDL Futura FDD2, a double-deck coach to replace the VDL Synergy. This is available in two lengths, 13m (FDD2-130) and 14.1m (FDD2-141).

It is a public entity composed of South Africa's local governments. The association's members are made of all South Africa's 257 local governments. The purpose of the SALGA is to represent local governments of South Africa at various stages and levels of government. It supports local governments in their efforts of development, assists members in varying ways, and even works to promote women in local government. There has been criticism that the SALGA is weak and ineffective at representing local government interests.  Local Government in South Africa  Municipalities of South Africa, 2016 The Constitution of South Africa enshrines the many roles and powers of local and municipal government. South Africa is a developmental state, in the context that the social development is promoted through the state intervening in the economy. Per section 152, this means that economic and social development relies heavily on municipalities. Section 152 is part of Chapter 7 of the Constitution, which features policy on local government. Section 151 states the many rights municipalities have in governance of their communities. It also states the restrictions of the national and provincial government in infringing on the governmental power of municipalities. Municipalities have broad authorities and power, much more codified than in many other countries. Scholars including Van der Waldt and Thornhill assert that the nexus of public service delivery in South Africa is local government. Local government is not simply a single municipality, but a whole, separate sphere of government. It is the closet government to the people.  History  Local, provincial, and national government must work together in South Africa. The South African Local Government Association was created in 1997 to better ensure this, as heavy emphasis was placed on the importance of local and municipal governments in South Africa's development. The 1997 Organised Local Government Act recognizes the South African Local Government Association. Section 21 of the 1973 Companies Act recognized its status as a public entity. The constitution governing the SALGA was adopted in the year 2000. It was amended in 2004, with substantive changes to membership policies, creating three categories of membership. The constitution of the SALGA was again amended in 2007, adding various changes pertaining to its governance structure. The SALGA is tied into international donor politics as well. In the later 1990s, the US National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI) had a goal of strengthening countries' legislatures to ensure their governments are more accountable to their citizens. Ethics codes and comparable legislation were among the activities to develop \\"structural framework for local government\\". The main project included the SALGA among various other South African agencies, organizations, and provincial legislatures in a USAID program that provided over $3.8 million in funding. The project was also supplemented by another project that studied parliaments of other countries to increase the effectiveness of legislatures; it was received around $270,000 from the US funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED).  Structure  Fees from members, donors for various projects, various other sources, and funds from the national budget provide funding for the SALGA. The South African Local Government Association is structured in two main divisions; its political structure and administrative structure. The political structure consists of the organization's arm in developing policy. It is divided into the National Executive Committee and the Provincial Conferences. The National Executive Committee is divided into the National Conference, National Executive Committee, Working Groups, and the Chief Executive Officer. The Provincial Conference is structured into the Provincial Conference, Provincial Member Assembly, Provincial Executive Committee, Working Groups, and the Provincial Executive Officer. The National Executive Committee and the Provincial Conferences aim to implement policy. The administrative organization is structured in a way that the SALGA can easily work with support municipalities, to ensure that they can provide services to their communities. It is organized into eight directorates, led by the office of the CEO. The Current Chief Executive Officer is Xolile George. The eight directorates are the Provincial Offices, Governance and IGR, Strategy, Policy & Research, Municipal Institutional Development, Economic Development & Development Planning, Municipal Infrastructure & Services, Community Development, and Finance & Corporate Services. The SALGA has ten permanent seats on the National Council of Provinces, though these are not voting delegates. The South African Local Government Association releases an Annual Performance Plan (APP).  Role and function  Local government in South Africa is strong and the South African Local Government Association is another avenue for local governments to meet their goals of development and providing services. The SALGA advocates for local and municipal interests at the provincial and national political levels. It analyzes and attempts to offer solutions to problems faced by local and municipal governments. It analyzes numerous elements of local and municipal government, sharing findings and recommendations with all its members. The SALGA supports and advises localities in various manners, to promote and sustain development in communities. The South African local Government Association has many mandates. This includes aiding and counseling members, advocating on behalf of municipalities to various stakeholders, standing as a body to represent members, and \\"contributing to the positioning of local government\\". Regarding local economic development planning (LED), it cannot direct support to a particular local authority. There are services intended to build up LED which the SALGA cannot direct the delivery of these services. SALGA has many mandated roles to improve LED. The SALGA works to coordinate LED throughout the country, through the project known as LED networks. The network gathers and shares information about LED to localities throughout the country. The association works on LED internationally with the Commonwealth Local Government Association and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. The SALGA advocates for local government and municipalities at other levels of government, and it works to foster positive intergovernmental relations between the other government spheres and local government. The SALGA, following prescriptions of the Intergovernmental Relations (IGR) Framework Act, supports various IGR policies, structures, and institutions. The association also works to ensure local government input is included in the national budget. A study of the South African Local Government Association found that regarding LED, there are two ways SALGA and its activities could maintain a crucial role. The first is that it could foster a better understanding of what LED is and the role municipalities and local governments have in it. This will also raise awareness of LED. The second is that the data SALGA supplies for local planning, along with the support of localities to understand LED networks and economic chains, leads to stimulation of local economies, which contributes to alleviating poverty. The SALGA takes action to empower women and support gender equality in local government. The 2006 election saw a 50:50 campaign ran by SALGA to promote equal gender councillor representation. The association also organizes summits and conferences for women in local government.  Actions taken by the SALGA  The SALGA publishes a magazine entitled Voice of the Local Government in association with Picasso Headline, which is part of the Tiso Blackstar Group. This magazine concerns local government and municipalities, boosting the visibility of the issues concerning them. It features content regarding the transformation of local governments and developmental service delivery. In 2006, the South African Local Government Association implemented a program that was part of the Development Bank of Southern Africa's \\"Operation Siyenza Manzi\\". The program was run in collaboration with DPLG and the National Treasury. In 2007, the SALGA published a report on municipal affairs, explaining what weakened municipality performance. Findings include that councillors' duties are not clearly defined, their offices lack legal support, and lack counseling when making decisions. The South African Local Government Association partnered with other institutions, including the University of Pretoria to provide relevant programming to local governments. Executive leadership and management is among this programming. In 2009, the South African Local Government Association received a study it commissioned on the arrangements of internal municipal governments and municipal service delivery. The study found political parties interfered in the function of municipalities' administrations. Many municipal political appointments were due to political loyalties rather than merit. The reports' authors found that this could have destructive consequences on municipal governments. In 2010, the SALGA developed a plan to ensure municipalities and local communities could all receive benefits brought in from the 2010 World Cup. In 2014, the City of Johannesburg expressed concern that its expansion would mean that landfill sites would be unable to be hidden in the coming years. The SALGA intervened and appealed to other cities and municipalities in the province to find creative solutions to this issue. The SALGA provided a waste management specialist to aid in resolving the crisis. The 2016 Annual Performance Plan (APP) features much reflection, as the twentieth anniversary of the association approached. The Plan identified municipalities' key problem areas. A ten-point plan was featured, containing actions and recommendations to improve community experiences. The Plan featured a revenue model, which was questioned by members at the National Assembly meeting discussing the APP. This questioning was due to the number of municipalities being reduced from 278 to 257; members expressed this could affect their model. Members also questioned the claim that the SALGA was capacitating municipalities. They wanted to know the plans and actions SALGA would take to deliver through these claims. In June 2017, then South African Local Government Association President, Parks Tau, addressed the Council of Mayors in Cape Town. He expressed that a \\"capable and developmental state\\", especially locally, can implement the goals of the SALGA. The SALGA national executive committee recommended that new and innovative revenue streams were needed to fund local spheres of government. Tau proposed various types of bonds, as well as public private partnerships to accomplish this. He also remarked on the need to work with government and parliament to achieve these goals.  Criticism  The South African Local Government Association has faced criticism regarding its effectiveness, as shown in a study conducted by the Department and Ministry of Provincial and Local Government. The SALGA is seen as lacking the ability to effectively advocate for local and municipal interests and bring about change and substantive policy. In 2016, SALGA had been waiting over eight years for a Departmental grant. The absence of this grant hindered many of its proposed and desired activities. The South African Local Government Association was criticized by members at a 2016 National Assembly meeting regarding its response to municipalities suffering from drought. Some members remarked that SALGA should be more bold in its recommendations to combat the drought and its effects. The SALGA, along with general municipalities, was criticized as hindering the expression of freedom of speech, because different restrictions and policies prevented people from protesting mining and other work. Critics called for SALGA to comply with court rulings, ensure staff are trained in knowing protest policy, to investigate impartially allegations of improper restrictions on protesting, and that there is appropriate discipline for localities implementing improper protest policy.

The island lies just off shore from the town of Br√∏nn√∏ysund on the mainland. It is connected to Br√∏nn√∏ysund by the Br√∏nn√∏ysund Bridge. There were 815 residents living on the island in 2015. The unique tall mountain Torghatten is the highest point on the island, located on the southern tip of the island. The mountain has a hole through the middle, so Torghatten is a popular tourist destination. It is estimated that there are on average about 100,000 visitors each year. Near Torghatten, there is a campsite where tourists can rent cabins or rent space for camping. There is also a small swimming area and a small restaurant right on the water. Previously, there was a restaurant further away from the bathing area that was severely damaged in a storm. Many tourists from, among others, Norway and Germany come to Torget to hike the mountain and see the hole going through it. This hole, which is long, high, and wide, was created during the ice age. The walk up to the hole takes place on a well- built path and takes about 20 minutes. If you go up one side, down the other side and around Torghatten it takes about 1 hour. Ice and water dug in the loose rocks painfully, while the harder rocks in the top of the mountain remained.

Released in beta testing in November 2019, it launched for subscribers of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on September 15, 2020.  Development  Microsoft teased the service at E3 2018 and formally announced Project xCloud several months later, in October 2018. They demonstrated the service in March 2019 with the racing game Forza Horizon 4 playing on an Android smartphone with an Xbox One controller. Xbox head Phil Spencer used a private server during this time to test games on a remote connection. The service entered its home testing phase in May 2019, when it could be used outside the lab environment. It is slated for public testing later in the year and an unveiling at E3 2019. xCloud runs via Microsoft's 54 Azure cloud computing centers, hosted in 140 countries. The service is designed to work with phones, either with touchscreen controls or Xbox controller over Bluetooth. Microsoft said that its Xbox content library will make its service more appealing than competitors such as Stadia. The hardware at launch was based Xbox One S blade servers, but it is expected to transition to Xbox Series X servers by 2021; the Xbox Series X's backward compatibility will allow xCloud to retain the existing library of Xbox games while adding new games from the Xbox Series X. Trials of the service began in October 2019, and as of November 2019, the service hosts 50 games, with support in testing for Apple Inc.'s iOS mobile devices, and for Sony Interactive Entertainment's DualShock controllers. On February 12, 2020, Project xCloud launched on Apple‚Äôs mobile operating system in a preview version. On May 5, 2020, Project xCloud came to Spain (Europe) in preview (Video on live). Microsoft released xCloud across 21 countries in North America and Europe, as well as in South Korea, on September 15, 2020 for select Android devices, with support for more than 150 games at launch. The xCloud service is included free of charge within the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. While Microsoft had planned to release xCloud for iOS devices, the company halted iOS testing in August 2020, asserting that policies on the Apple App Store limited what functionality they could provide for the service. Apple clarified that cloud streaming services like xCloud allow Microsoft to release games onto the iOS platform that bypass the normal checks that Apple performs for other apps, and thus refused to allow the app on the platform. However, in September 2020, Apple altered its rules that allowed xCloud and other cloud gaming apps to work on iOS, with restrictions that each game must be offered as an individual download on the iOS store which the user must use before playing, though catalog apps as part of the service can list and link to these games. Microsoft responded negatively to this change, stating that \\"This remains a bad experience for customers. Gamers want to jump directly into a game from their curated catalog within one app just like they do with movies or songs, and not be forced to download over 100 apps to play individual games from the cloud. We‚Äôre committed to putting gamers at the center of everything we do, and providing a great experience is core to that mission.\\" Microsoft suggested in October 2020 that to work around Apple's restriction, it may bring xCloud to iOS as a browser-based application, which would not have its content restricted by the App Store limitations.

Wernimont is an American academic who is the Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities and Social Engagement at Dartmouth College. Her first book, Numbered Lives Life and Death in Quantum Media, was released by MIT Press in January 2019. It is the first book to map connections in feminist media history. She is the founding Director of Human Security Collaborator (HS Collab), a collaboration of interdisciplinary academics working on digital civil rights and big data.  Early life and education  Wernimont studied English and molecular biology at the University of Iowa. She moved to Brown University for her graduate studies, earning a master's degree and PhD. When she started graduated school she worked on how postcolonial literature and the accounting of death were related. Wernimont worked on the Brown University Women Writers Project, where she began her career as a text encoder and ended up as a project manager. The Women Writers Project, which later relocated from Brown to Northeastern University, looks to reclaim the importance of pre-Victorian women's writing.  Research  Wernimont joined Scripps College as an Assistant Professor of English, where she explored how poetries could be transformed into a 3D object. She directed the Counting the Dead project, which explored the relationship between early modern numerical and commemorative poetic technologies. She was appointed at Arizona State University, where she specialised in literary history and feminist digital media. She directed the graduate certificate in Digital Humanities. In 2015 she established the Center for Solutions to Online Violence. Together with Elizabeth Losh and Mikki Kendall, Wernimont looked at the Gamergate controversy. The trio convened the Addressing Anti-Feminist Violence Online conference at the Arizona State University. She studied the history of eugenic sterilisation in California. Together with Alexandra Stern, Wernimot wrote The Eugenic Rubicon, a digital resource that compiled archival documents and data visualisation. The work was supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities Humanities Collections and Reference Resources seed grant. Indiana was the first state to pass eugenics laws in 1907, allowing the sterilisation of people deemed to be of diminished mental capacity. Wernimot has described how, with the illusion for genetic improvement, eugenics became a chance for men to control women. Between the 1920s and 1930s, sterilisation shifted from mainly men to women, with the majority from underrepresented minority groups. She found that girls as young as 13 were being sterilised, with some being described as being \\"in the class of the feebleminded\\". Eugenics laws began to be repealed in the 1970s, but non-consenting sterilisation has been reported as recently as 2010. In October 2018 Wernimont joined Dartmouth College. She maintains an \\"angry bibliography\\", a collection of content produced by diverse academics. She was the chief editor of Intersectional Feminism and Digital Humanities. She is an active part of FemTechNet collective.  Publications In January 2019 Wernimont's first book was published by MIT Press. Numbered Lives Life and Death in Quantum Media is a feminist media history of quantification. It includes death counts and activity trackers, quotidian media that determine who counts.

He is voiced by Aaron Paul and was created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg.  Biography  Todd Chavez was born in 1991. In the 2000s, he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. He is a friendly and lovable slacker who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence. Todd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese; entrepreneurial know-how, and writing and composing his own rock opera, Newtopia Rising, Book I: The Search for a New Utopia. His rock opera was eventually sabotaged by BoJack, who took advantage of his former addiction to video games. Todd puts the pieces together of what BoJack did in a string map style and begins to question their friendship. Todd often stumbles into absurd and dangerous situations, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case switching places Prince and the Pauper-style with a dictator. Todd's friendship with Mr. Peanutbutter landed him various jobs creating seemingly useless products. He sees the best in BoJack, despite his multitude of problems, up until \\"It's You\\" in season three, where he finally snaps at him for his constant misdoings. Todd and Bojack do not speak again until the season four episode \\"Hooray! Todd Episode!\\" where a meek Bojack lets him know that he's a good friend. Todd is usually happy, even when being insulted by BoJack. He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. It is revealed in the season 3 finale \\"That Went Well\\" that he is asexual. In season 5, he gets a desk job at a clock website company called \\"What Time Is It Right Now\\", but then he gets laid off at the very end of season 5. In season 6 episode \\"The Kidney Stays in the Picture\\", he gives one of his kidneys to his mom who is in desperate need of one. He later begins a relationship with Maude, who is asexual just like him, and they quickly move in together, having similar interests. He reconciles with his mother in season 6 episode \\"Angela\\". At the end of the series, Todd reconnects with BoJack at Princess Carolyn's wedding, revealing that he enjoys a comfortable life with Maude and his daycare service which he runs in the VIM Management building.

It is dedicated to the Visitation (Heimsuchung). The tall concrete building is a landmark of Wiesbaden. It features two large triptychs by the Wiesbaden painter Otto Ritschl. The parish Mari√§ Heimsuchung is now part of a larger parish, in the Diocese of Limburg.  History  After World War II, Catholics who came from further east settled in Wiesbaden. Bishop Wilhelm Kempf installed a new parish, Mari√§ Heimsuchung, in Wiesbaden-Dotzheim in 1960. The church was built on a design by the Berlin architect Johannes Lackel. It was consecrated on 3 July 1966, dedicated to the Visitation. The shape of the building is a stylised letter \\"M\\" as a symbol for Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the floor is the Star of David, indicating that she was Jewish. The materials are predominantly concrete as the common material at the time, also slate and glass. Light comes from the west and illuminates the high wall behind the altar in the east. The interior features two large triptychs by from Wiesbaden. The artist created the works in 1973 and 1976 as abstract paintings with large shapes in bold colours, intended to invite to prayer and meditation.

It is the fifth version of Falcon 9 Full Thrust, powered by SpaceX Merlin engines burning liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellants. In 2017, Falcon 9 Block 5 succeeded the transitional Block 4 version. The main changes from Block 3 to Block 5 are higher thrust engines and improvements to the landing legs. Numerous other small changes helped streamline recovery and re- usability of first-stage boosters, increase production rate, and optimize re- usability. Each Block 5 booster is designed to fly ten times with only minor attention, and up to 100 times with refurbishment. The maiden flight launched the satellite Bangabandhu-1 on May 11, 2018. The CRS-15 mission on June 29, 2018 was the last Block 4 version of Falcon 9 to be launched. This was the transition to an all Block 5 fleet. Overview The Block 5 design changes are principally driven by upgrades needed for NASA's Commercial Crew program and National Security Space Launch requirements. They include performance upgrades, manufacturing improvements, and \\"probably 100 or so changes\\" to increase the margin for demanding customers. In April 2017, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that Block 5 will feature 7‚Äì8% more thrust by uprating the engines (from to per engine). Block 5 includes an improved flight control system for an optimized angle of attack on the descent, lowering landing fuel requirements.

Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. * a reusable heat shield protecting the engines and plumbing at the base of the rocket; * more temperature-resistant cast and machined titanium grid fins; * a thermal protection coating on the first stage to limit reentry heating damage, including a black thermal protection layer on the landing legs, raceway, and interstage; * Redesigned and requalified more robust and longer life valves. * Redesigned composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV 2.0) for helium, to avoid oxygen freezing inside the structure of the tanks that lead to rupture. For rapid reusability: * reduced refurbishment between flights. * a set of retractable landing legs for rapid recovery and shipping. * the Octaweb structure is bolted together instead of welded, reducing manufacturing time. Human rating NASA required seven flights without major design changes before the vehicle can be certified for human spaceflight for carrying NASA astronauts. The initial Block 5 boosters did not have the redesigned composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV2) tanks. The first booster with COPV2 tanks was booster B1047 on the Es'hail 2 mission on November 15, 2018, and the second booster using the COPV2 tanks was CRS-16/B1050, which had its first launch on December 5, 2018. The Block 5 design launched astronauts for the first time on May 30, 2020, on a NASA-contracted flight labelled Crew Dragon Demo-2.

She worked for Voice of America radio. She is known for her testimony before US Senator Joseph McCarthy about dismissal from government service, defending Abraham Lincoln, reading a favorable review of Whittaker Chambers' 1952 memoir Witness, and refusing to live with her supervisor in a commune. Early life Lenkeith was born in London, United Kingdom, circa 1922. In 1942, she graduated from Barnard College. She obtained a doctorate in philosophy. She taught at Queens College in Brooklyn, New York, for two years. Career In December 1952, Nancy Lenkeith joined Voice of America. She was a scriptwriter of VOA broadcasts in French. Her supervisor fired her after she broadcast a review favorable to Whittaker Chambers' book, Witness. Roy Cohn solicited from her information that her superior had denounced Abraham Lincoln: \\"That damn Lincoln! Why do we have to talk about him again?\\" Senate subcommittee chairman Joseph McCarthy refused to let her relate details about a proposition received from Troup Mathews, acting head of the VOA's French section. Lenkeith testified that she was \\"sort of stunned\\" when Mathews suggested it \\"could be arranged\\" or \\"worked out\\" for her to have children with no husband. Matthews shared that he was thinking about a Marxist commune. In New York, Mathews, a decorated World War II veteran, denounced her testimony \\"a tissue of fabrication.\\" Lenkeith accused him of lax supervision. Later, Matthews explained he was buying collective housing in a New York suburb and wondering whether to buy into its cooperative; McCarthy would not let him testify. As soon as McCarthy obtained her affirmation that, yes, she was an anti-Communist, he had her leave the stand. Personal life and death In 1954, Lenkeith married Michael Horneffer (1914‚Äì1966).

Education  Simmons graduated cum laude from Pomona College in 1981. She then earned her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1989.  Teaching  Simmons began working as a teaching assistant for the University of California, Berkeley in 1986. She went on to become an instructor of paleontology in 1987 and a zoology lecturer in 1988.  American Museum of Natural History  In addition to research, Simmons works closely with the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Ever since she began as a Kalbfleisch/Hoffman Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the AMNH in 1989, Simmons has conducted research for the museum as a faculty member. She is currently the Curator-in-Charge, Department of Mammalogy, Division of Vertebrate Zoology. Simmons is also a professor at the Richard Gilder Graduate School, a Ph.D. program in comparative biology offered by the American Museum of Natural History.  Research  Simmons' research is primarily focused on the phylogeny of bats. Using both morphological data and DNA sequence data, Simmons has conducted numerous studies that shed light on the relationships not only between different bat species, but between the Chiroptera clade and other clades. Using living and fossilized specimen, she studies bat behavior, diet, mechanisms of flight, and echolocation, applying her knowledge of phylogeny to explain certain phenomena. Her extensive field work in Central America, South America, and Southeast Asia has led her to discover several species of bats, such as Sanborn's big-eared bat.http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/bitstream/handle/2246/3679/N3158.pdf?sequence=1 Her findings contribute to constructing large-scale phylogenetic trees. Simmons and her team have submitted numerous evolutionary data surrounding bats and other animal clades to Morphobank, an archive of evolutionary research. Furthermore, Simmons' team has also worked on the project Assembling the Tree of Life, where numerous organizations worked to piece together mammalian phylogeny through morphology.  MorphoBank  Simmons' evolutionary data has contributed to MorphoBank's database of morphological features, submitting hundreds of morphological characteristics of Chiroptera species in order to conduct genetic testing to create an accurate phylogenetic tree. Simmons has also accessed MorphoBank as the curator for the American Museum of Natural History to engage in outreach work. In 2013, Simmons worked as part of the Morpholution program to help high school students engage in state-of-the- art digital analysis tools provided by MorphoBank to examine evolutionary relationships.

Water in excess of the City's needs spills over the New Croton Dam at the New Croton Reservoir and is carried by the Croton River into the Hudson River at Croton-on-Hudson, New York, about 30 miles north of the Metropolitan area. Definition The three branches of the Croton River are collected at the New Croton Reservoir. Flow in excess of New York City's needs goes over a spillway at the New Croton Dam there and discharges into the Hudson River The Croton River watershed is a hydrological feature, the drainage basin of the Croton River and its tributaries. It is not synonymous with the Croton Watershed, a term describing the rivers, reservoirs, dams, pump systems, and other infrastructure of the southernmost watershed of the New York City water supply system. Numerous small natural lakes and ponds, as well as large Lake Mahopac, are within the river's watershed but not owned, leased, or controlled by the City water supply system (even though they too ultimately drain into it). A map of the actual Croton Watershed is found here. The Croton River ( ) is a river in southern New York with three principal tributaries: the West Branch, Middle Branch, and East Branch. Their waters, all part of the City water supply system, join downstream from the Croton Falls Reservoir. Together, their waters and the reservoirs linked to them represent the northern half of the New York City water system's Croton Watershed. Shortly after the confluence of the three Croton River branches the Croton River proper, along with its tributary, the Muscoot River, flow into the Muscoot Reservoir, after which it empties into the New Croton Reservoir, which feeds the New Croton Aqueduct supplying water to New York City via the Jerome Park Reservoir in the Bronx. Excess water leaves the spillway at the New Croton Dam and empties into the Hudson River at Croton-on-Hudson, New York at Croton Point, about north of New York City.

This vision was granted him by Basil's intercession and begins in Basil's house, where Theodora lay dying. Saint Basil the Younger (died 26 March 944/952) was a Byzantine Greek holy man and visionary. He is the subject of a Greek hagiographical biography, the Vita sancti Basilii iunioris, written by his pupil Gregory. Although the Vita portrays its subject as historical, there is yet no consensus whether Basil or even Gregory were real persons or fabrications. Vita Manuscripts The Vita sancti Basilii iunioris is preserved in whole or in part in a total of 24 manuscripts dating from the 12th to the 19th century. The fullest is the 16th-century Greek MS no. 249 of the Synodal (Patriarchal) Library in Moscow and published in Fran√ßois Halkin, Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca, 3rd edition (Brussels, 1957). Two 13th-century manuscripts are also known. Parisinus Gr. 1547 is an abridged text that uses less florid language generally. It has been published by Fran√ßois Combefis in the Bollandist Acta Sanctorum, March III (1668). The codex Iviron 478 from Mount Athos contains only the visions and none of the biographical or historical material. It has been published by S. G. Vilinskij in Zapiski Imperatorskogo novorossijskogo universiteta (Odessa, 1911). Despite the publication of parts of these three manuscripts, no critical edition was produced before 2014, when a critical edition with an annotated English translation appeared. In the 14th-century, the Vita was translated into Middle Bulgarian. This text was only found in 1975 in codex no. 20N from St Catherine's Monastery, Sinai. The translation was made by a certain Father Peter. Date of composition The composition of the Vita is usually dated to between 956 and 959. The terminus post quem is provided by the death of the Patriarch Theophylaktos, whom Gregory readily criticizes; the terminus ante quem by the death of Constantine VII, since his joint reign with his son Romanos II is mentioned but there is no reference to Romanos' sole reign. The terminus ante may, however, be pushed back to 961 (the death of Romanos' mother Helena Lekapene) or even 963 (date of composition of the Vision of Kosmas). Vision of Theodora One of the most famous passage's in the Vita concerns the death of Theodora, Basil's servant. Shortly after her death, Gregory asks Basil if Theodora was rewarded in the afterlife and Basil grants Gregory a vision. His vision begins in Basil's house, where Theodora is dying. She is surrounded by Ethiopians (representative of demons), who bear documents recording all her sins. As Theodora's soul exits her body, two angels weigh her good deeds against her sins until Basil arrives to provide a scarlet bag full of gold, his supererogatory good works, to outweigh her sins. The demons leave and Theodora and the angels go up through the air. The passage through the air towards heaven is interrupted by 21 toll houses (telonia), each manned by demons and dedicated to exposing a specific sin: Theodora's soul runs out of good deeds to outweigh her sins by the fifth toll house and must rely thereafter on Basil's gold. The angels tell her that at baptism each person receives a guardian angel to record her good deeds and a demon to record her sins. If she fails at any toll house, the demons cast her soul into Hades. The angels inform Theodora, who did not practice confession, that only through confession and penance can one erase one's sins while alive. The toll house of fornication, they add, is the most dangerous one. Theodora successfully passes through the toll houses, enters heaven and sees God. Life Of the 301 printed pages of the Moscow version of the Vita, 38 cover the vision of the death of Basil's servant Theodora and 162 cover the visions of the Resurrection and the Last Judgement. The Vita is as much a piece of visionary literature as it is a standard saint's life. \\"The author ... is evidently less concerned with [Basil's life] as such than with using him as a pretext for recounting numerous other matters of interest to him.\\" Chronologically, the Vita is divided into three parts separated by long gaps. Between the first and second parts there is a gap of 17 years and between the second and third one of about 20 years. Move to Constantinople At the start of the Vita, Basil is living in Asia Minor as a grass-eating hermit or boskos. Arrested on suspicion of espionage, he is brought to Constantinople, where he is interrogated, tortured and thrown before a lion by the parakoimomenos Samonas. Unbroken, he does not even reveal his name and is thrown into the sea, where he is rescued by dolphins, who take him to Hebdomon. From there he returns to Constantinople, where he is sheltered by a poor husband and wife named John and Helena. This episode is said to take place in the tenth year of the joint reign of Leo VI and Alexander, which would be 896. Samonas, however, did not become parakoimomenos until 907. After the death of John and Helena, Basil moves into the house of Constantine Barbaros, Samonas' successor as parakoimomenos, in the Arkadianai quarter. There he spent the rest of his life except for a week he spent in the Great Palace of Constantinople and a short period he spent as a guest in the house of the Paphlagonian brothers Anastasios and Constantine Gongylios near the Harbour of Eleutherios. These brothers, relatives of Barbaros and of the tourmarches of Paphlagonia, are said to have been held in high regard by those reigning at the time, which points to the period of the regency of Empress Zoe Karbonopsina in 914‚Äì919 for Basil's stay. All three of Basil's hosts‚ÄîBarbaros and the Gongylioi‚Äîwere eunuchs. Barbaros disappears from the historical record after the failed revolt his relative, Leo Phokas, in 919. During his stay in the Great Palace, Basil rebukes Romanos I for his greediness and lechery, a reproach that the emperor, indulgent towards monks, did not mind. Basil also convinces a certain Kosmas, who had ambitions of becoming emperor, to abandon his worldly pursuits and become a hermit near Nicomedeia. This story seems to be based on that of Kosmas the Monk, who had a famous vision in 933. Predictions and visions The second part of the Vita recounts in detail the rebellion of Constantine Doukas in 913, which Basil is said to have predicted. Gregory admits that this part of the work is little concerned with Basil. It may be included because Doukas's widow was forced to retire to an estate in Paphlagonia or as an excuse to criticize the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos. The third part of the Vita begins in the reign of Romanos I, specifically after the death of his son Christopher (931) and at a time when there were seven persons of imperial rank in the palace. This is probably a reference to the widowed Romanos I, and his sons Stephen and Constantine and their wives, as well as Romanos' daughter Helena Lekapene and her husband, Constantine VII. The date of the marriages of Stephen and Constantine are not known with certainty, but Stephen's wife, Anna Gabalas, was only crowned in 933 and Constantine's first wife is not recorded before 939. Basil, however, prophesies that Helena will give birth to another daughter and then a son named Romanos, Since Romanos II was born in 938, this prophecy could only have been made in the mid-930s. In this part, Basil also predicts the Rus' attack on Constantinople in 941 four months in advance. God also gives him foreknowledge of the planned coup d'√©tat of Romanos I's son-in- law Romanos Saronites. Basil tries to talk Saronites out of it, but is treated cruelly. Saronites then falls ill and dies. This is contradicted by John Skylitzes, who says that Saronites entered a monastery during the reign of Romanos II. Skylitzes does link his retirement to a rebellion, but does not implicate Saronites in it. Death and burial Basil is said to have died on 26 March during Lent, which corresponds to either 944 or 952. The earlier date is more likely. According to Gregory, he was buried by Constantine Barbaros in the private church of the Theotokos on the Asian side of the strait across from the capital. This is chronologically implausible, given that Barbaros is not heard of after 919. The likely source for this story is Pseudo-Symeon, who records that Barbaros' father owned \\"a small suburban estate by the sea\\" near the capital and that Leo VI turned it into a monastery. The chronological inconsistencies and creative use of sources tell against the general historicity of the Vita.

Drafted into the Imperial Russian Army during World War I, Ostashenko served with the Southwestern Front between 1916 and 1917 and was demobilized in early 1918. Returning to his home area, he joined the Red Army, serving as a political worker and then as a junior commander during the Russian Civil War and Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. After the end of the war, between 1922 and 1923, he was arrested on charges of aiding deserters, but after a suspended sentence was ultimately reinstated in the Red Army. Ostashenko served in command and staff positions during the interwar period and when Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941 was deputy commander of the 6th Rifle Division. After the division suffered heavy losses in the opening days of the war Ostashenko became acting commander before being transferred to command the 368th Rifle Division in September. Having spent much of 1942 in a course at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy, he briefly took command of the 35th Guards Rifle Division during the Battle of Stalingrad before transferring to lead the 47th Guards Rifle Division in 1943. Ostashenko commanded the 57th Rifle Corps from early 1944 and was made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership of it in two crossings of the Tisza during the Budapest Offensive in October and November. In the final months of the war and early postwar period he commanded the 25th Guards Rifle Corps. After serving as an instructor at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy from the late 1940s, Ostashenko was dismissed from service in 1956.  Early life, World War I and Russian Civil War  Ostashenko was born on 19 June 1896 in the village of Bolshaya Lyubshchina, Yanovichskoy volost, Vitebsky Uyezd, Vitebsk Governorate to a peasant family. He graduated from four grades at a gymnasium. During World War I, he was mobilized for military service on 7 August 1915, being sent to the 4th Company of the Reserve Battalion of the Petrograd Lifeguard Regiment in Petrograd. With the battalion, he fought with the Southwestern Front between July 1916 and February 1917, then returned to Petrograd before being demobilized on 13 March 1918. In July, he volunteered for the Red Army, serving in the Vitebsky Uyezd military commissariat as a clerk and instructor organizer. From May 1919 Ostashenko served as a Red Army man and political soldier ‚Äì a Communist mobilized to conduct political work in the army ‚Äì in the march battalion of the Vitebsk Reserve Regiment. From July he served as an assistant platoon commander in the 84th Rifle Regiment of the 10th Rifle Division, which fought against the Northwestern Army near Petrograd as part of the 15th Army of the Western Front. He entered the Smolensk Commanders' Infantry Courses in November and upon graduation in June 1920 became a platoon commander in the Rzhev-based 2nd Reserve Regiment. This assignment proved to be brief and a month later, Ostashenko became adjutant of the 4th Landing Detachment for armored trains with the Western Front. He fought with the detachment, which provided landing parties for armored trains, in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and was wounded twice.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, from February 1921, Ostashenko served as a company commander and acting head of the regimental troops in the Vitebsk Territorial Regiment. He became adjutant to the commander of the Vitebsk Governorate CHON in November, but was arrested by the GPU in Vitebsk during April 1922 for \\"illegally issuing two vacation tickets, contributing to the desertion of two servicemen\\". Sentenced by a military tribunal in October to a one-year suspended sentence, Ostashenko was released in December and placed at the disposal of the Vitebsk Governorate military commissariat. Dismissed from the Red Army in May 1923, he was again drafted into the cadre of the Red Army in July and sent to the 79th Rifle Regiment in Vitebsk, with which he served as senior and assistant chief of economic troops, assistant chief of the regimental machine gun troops, assistant chief and acting chief of the regimental school, and as an assistant company commander. In July 1925 he became a company commander in the 190th Rifle Regiment in Smolensk. From September 1926 he was a company commander and student in the mid-level commanders' refresher courses at the Ashenbrenner Moscow Infantry School and upon graduation in August 1927 continued to serve as a company commander and head of the regimental school in the 190th Regiment. From April 1929, he was a battalion commander in the 15th Rifle Regiment in Polotsk. Ostashenko served as assistant chief of the 2rd and 2nd sectors of the 2nd staff department in the Belorussian Military District headquarters, and in March 1933 became chief of the 2nd staff department. He became chief of the 2nd division of the 4th staff department in February 1935. A colonel by December 1937, when he was sent to the Vystrel course, Ostashenko became assistant commander of the 52nd Rifle Division in Mozyr upon graduation in September 1938. A year later, he was appointed commandant of the Mozyr Fortified Region, and in September 1940 Ostashenko became deputy commander of the 6th Rifle Division of the Western Special Military District.  World War II  Ostashenko still held this position when Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began in June 1941. As part of the 28th Rifle Corps of the 4th Army of the Western Front, the 6th fought in defensive battles on the Brest and Bobruisk directions. At the beginning of July with the corps its remnants were withdrawn to the front reserve, around which time he became temporary division commander. The division was rebuilt and subsequently fought in defensive battles on the left bank of the Sozh River near Propoysk. Appointed commander of the 368th Rifle Division, initially in the Siberian Military District and later with the 7th Separate Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, on 23 September, Ostashenko entered the accelerated course at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy around 10 June 1942. Upon graduation in November, he was appointed commander of the 35th Guards Rifle Division between 21 November and 6 December, but instead became commander of the 47th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Tank Army (used to reform the 12th Army in April 1943) on 20 December; he was simultaneously promoted to major general. Under his command, the 47th Guards fought in the Battle of Stalingrad, during which they helped to encircle and destroy the German 6th Army west of Stalingrad. Subsequently, as part of the 12th Army, now part of the Southwestern Front, the division fought in the Donbass Strategic Offensive. For his leadership of the division in the latter, Ostashenko received the Order of the Red Banner. From December, Ostashenko commanded the 57th Rifle Corps, which served with the 37th and 53rd Armies of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, participating in the attack towards Krivoy Rog. In January 1944, the corps, with the 37th Army, was transferred to the 3rd Ukrainian Front, fighting in offensives to recapture southwestern Ukraine. During the Nikopol‚ÄìKrivoi Rog, Bereznegovatoye‚ÄìSnigeryovka, and Odessa Offensives, Ostashenko led the corps in a 350-kilometer advance, crossing the Inhul, the Southern Bug, and the Dniester. After the corps returned to the 53rd Army, now with the 2nd Ukrainian Front, he led it in the October Budapest Offensive, the capture of Tiraspol, Eger, and settlements and fortified points in Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. During the Budapest Offensive, units of the corps crossed the Tisza and captured a bridgehead. The 7th Guards Army was sent into the bridgehead, and the 57th Rifle Corps itself was transferred to another sector, from which it recrossed the Tisza on 7 November, capturing a 30-kilometer deep bridgehead by 11 November. Ostashenko was transferred to command the 25th Guards Rifle Corps of the front's 7th Guards Army on 19 March 1945. He led it in the Bratislava‚ÄìBrno Offensive, capturing Senec and Bratislava. By 15 April, the corps had captured several cities and completed the capture of Slovakia. For his \\"courage and determination\\" in the Budapest Offensive, Ostashenko was made a Hero of the Soviet Union and awarded the Order of Lenin on 28 April, eight days after a promotion to lieutenant general. In early May, the corps ended the war with the army in the Prague Offensive.  Postwar  After the end of the war, Ostashenko continued to command the corps. He studied at the Higher Academic Courses at the Voroshilov Higher Military Academy from March 1947, graduating with honors in April 1948. After becoming a senior instructor at the academy in June, Ostashenko was granted the rights of a graduate of it in December 1951. Dismissed from service in October 1956, he died in Moscow on 27 October 1976 and was buried at the Vagankovo Cemetery.  Awards and honors  Grave of Ostashenko at the Vagankovo Cemetery Ostashenko was a recipient of the following decorations: * Hero of the Soviet Union * Order of Lenin (2) * Order of the Red Banner (3) * Order of Suvorov, 2nd class * Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class Ostashenko was made an honorary citizen of Tiraspol in 1969 and one of its streets was named for him in 1976.

This achievement attracted the interest of eminent geographers such as Heinrich Barth, Alexander Humboldt, Carl Ritter and August Petermann. Roscher soon embarked on a multi-year scientific expedition to Africa, arriving in Zanzibar in 1858, where he conducted botanical investigations and learned Swahili. In early 1859, he traveled down the coastline of what is now mainland Tanzania, exploring the waters around modern-day Dar es Salaam and charting the Rufiji delta. In June he landed at Kilwa. He remained there for two months while ill with malaria. He then joined an Arab slave caravan heading inland, arriving at Lake Malawi in October 1859, two months after the famed British explorer David Livingstone. On departing the shores of Lake Malawi in March 1860, Roscher was attacked and killed by one of his servants. There is speculation that his death resulted from Arab slave traders' fears that he would expose the practices of the Arab slave trade. His journals along with his geographical and anthropological observations were lost.

She first became known by prevailing in a decade-long struggle against the situating of a toxic landfill in her hometown of Pezinok. For this, ƒåaputov√° was awarded the 2016 Goldman Environmental Prize. ƒåaputov√° won the 2019 presidential election with 58% of the vote in the run-off. \\"We‚Äôll try to have a constructive relationship with neighbouring countries but at the same time have clear stances and positions based on values,\\" she told an interviewer.  Early life and education  Zuzana Strap√°kov√° was born into a working-class family in Bratislava. She grew up in the nearby town of Pezinok, in what was Czechoslovakia for the first two decades of her life. She has described her upbringing as having occurred within \\"an open-minded house\\". She studied at the Comenius University Faculty of Law in Bratislava, graduating in 1996. Between 1998 and 1999 she completed the training cycle \\"General Management ‚Äì Management of Change\\" and in 1999 the ARK ‚Äì Mediation course, accredited by the Ministry of Education of Slovakia.  Early career  After concluding her education, ƒåaputov√° worked in the local government of Pezinok, first as an assistant in the legal department, and later as a deputy to the town mayor. She later moved into the non-profit sector at the Open Society Foundations, where she handled public administration and the issue of abused and exploited children. Subsequently, she worked as a project manager at the civic association EQ Klub on local community development. Between 2001 and 2017, ƒåaputov√° worked with Via Iuris, a civic organization, as a lawyer (since 2010), and with Greenpeace on campaign planning. In Pezinok, for more than ten years, she was at the forefront of a public campaign against the authorization of another landfill that would aggravate pollution of the soil, air, and water in the city and its surrounding areas. The fight against the landfill culminated in 2013, when the ruled that the new landfill was illegal and violated environmental norms. ƒåaputov√° has run her own law firm and authored and co-authored several publications. She is a fellow of the Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide (ELAW), a network of environmental lawyers and jurists. Political activities ƒåaputov√° speaking to reporters, 2019 In December 2017, 'ƒåaputov√° announced her entry into the emerging political party Progressive Slovakia, and in January 2018, she was elected as a Vice- Chairwoman at the party's first congress, aiding 's efforts to assure the representation of a credible socially-liberal alternative to the conservative status quo in Slovakia. As a co-founding member of Progressive Slovakia, a non-parliamentary socially liberal and progressive party, she served as its Deputy Chair until March 2019, when she resigned due to her presidential candidacy. ƒåaputov√° was the party's candidate in the 2019 Slovak presidential election and proceeded to be elected president in the second round, after receiving over 58% of the vote and beating her opponent Vice President of the European Commission Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, an independent who was supported by the long-dominant Smer‚ÄìSD party.  Presidency  ƒåaputov√° and Robert Mistr√≠k, initially a front-runner who withdrew from the race and endorsed her. In a press conference held on 29 March 2018, ƒåaputov√° announced her bid for the Slovak presidency in the 2019 presidential race, having been endorsed by Progressive Slovakia along with SaS and SPOLU, after her main opponent, Robert Mistr√≠k, withdrew from the race and endorsed her on 26 February 2019. She said she had felt compelled to run for the Presidency after the murder of the investigative journalist J√°n Kuciak. ƒåaputov√° won the first round of the election on 16 March 2019, with 40.57% of the vote. She then defeated her second-place opponent, Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, by around 58% to 42% in the second run- off round on 30 March 2019. The second-round turnout of just 41.79% was the lowest for any round of voting in that type of election in Slovakia. The number of votes with which ƒåaputov√° was elected to office was also the lowest for any directly elected Slovakian president to date. Her presidential inauguration took place on 15 June 2019 during a special session of the National Council in Bratislava.  Political positions   Equality  On her campaign website, ƒåaputov√° says that \\"justice in Slovakia does not always apply equally to everyone\\". In keeping with her statements during the campaign, she plans to introduce changes to Slovakia's police and judicial system. She campaigned for the police force to be an independent institution without political influence, headed by an impartial professional with proven service. She further claims that it is necessary to transform the prosecutor's office into a publicly managed institution.  Environment  ƒåaputov√° is an environmental campaigner who has been compared to American activist Erin Brockovich. Climate change mitigation is one of her highest priorities, and for that reason she is ending subsidies for coal and other fossil fuels. ƒåaputov√° has promised to phase out coal mining and power generation by 2023, and brought her nation into the Powering Past Coal Alliance. ƒåaputov√° holds that environmental protection should include stopping illegal deforestation and that 5% of the most environmentally valuable territory should remain as a strictly protected zone.  LGBT rights ƒåaputov√° has stated that she supports registered partnerships for same-sex couples, and educating the general public on these relationships. In a discussion organized by SME Journal, she lectured on the possibility of adoption by gay couples: \\"I prefer the child to have a biological mother and a biological father. If he were to grow up in institutional care, I think he'd be better off with two loving beings, even if they were of the same sex\\".  Abortion and reproductive rights  ƒåaputov√° supports maintaining the status quo regarding abortion and reproductive rights: \\"If there is an extreme situation and the dilemma is between deciding whether to adopt a legal norm that will intrude upon the personal lives of citizens or leave it to women's responsibility and their personal choice, I choose the responsibility of a woman\\".  Personal life  ƒåaputov√° is divorced and has two daughters. She practices Zen yoga. She still lives in Pezinok. Awards ƒåaputov√° (third from the right) with the other 2016 winners of the Goldman Prize, along with then U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. For her strong and resolute leadership regarding the Pezinok landfill affair, ƒåaputov√° was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2016. Laureates of this prize are selected by an international jury and experts from around the world who have distinguished themselves for having a lasting and significant impact on environmental protection. The Goldman award was delivered to ƒåaputov√° in San Francisco. Her long and eventually triumphant struggle has been compared to that of the American Erin Brockovich. The text of the prize states that she was awarded for her \\"relentless campaigning against the opening of a landfill in the town of Pezinok, which, if opened, would further aggravate potential health hazards and would contribute to urban pollution\\". In recognition of her efforts for the European democracy, ƒåaputov√° was awarded the European Prize for Political Culture in August 2019.

A member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, Minnesota's affiliate of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the Hennepin County Attorney. She ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 election, before pulling out in March and endorsing Joe Biden. Klobuchar's political positions have generally been in line with modern American liberalism. She is pro-choice on abortion, supports LGBT rights and the Affordable Care Act, and was critical of the Iraq War. According to GovTrack, Klobuchar passed more legislation than any other senator by the end of the 114th Congress in late 2016. According to Congress.gov, , she had sponsored or co-sponsored 111 pieces of legislation that became law. During the 115th Congress, she voted in line with President Donald Trump's position on legislation 31.1 percent of the time. Crime and criminal law Criminal justice reform In December 2018, Klobuchar voted for the First Step Act, legislation aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners through expanding job training and other programs in addition to forming an expansion of early-release programs and modifications on sentencing laws such as mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, \\"to more equitably punish drug offenders.\\" On July 31, 2019, following Attorney General William Barr announcing that the United States federal government would resume the use of the death penalty for the first time in over 20 years, Klobuchar was a cosponsor of a bill banning the death penalty. Gun laws As of October 2018, Klobuchar has an \\"F\\" rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA) for supporting gun control legislation. In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Klobuchar participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster. Following the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, Klobuchar was one of twenty-four senators to sign a letter to National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins espousing the view that it was critical the NIH \\"dedicate a portion of its resources to the public health consequences of gun violence\\" at a time when 93 Americans die per day from gun-related fatalities and noted that the Dickey Amendment did not prohibit objective, scientific inquiries into shooting death prevention. In an October 2017 interview, following the NRA publicly agreeing with the notion by some Republicans that bump stocks may need to be regulated, Klobuchar called it \\"one of the first times we've heard Republicans even open to talking about any kind of restrictions like this\\" and that there were a number of her fellow Congress members including Republicans \\"who have supported sensible background checks in addition to, of course, banning things like bump stocks.\\" In November 2017, Klobuchar was a cosponsor of the Military Domestic Violence Reporting Enhancement Act, a bill that would form a charge of Domestic Violence under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and stipulate that convictions would have to be reported to federal databases with the authority to keep abusers from purchasing firearms within three days in an attempt to close a loophole in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) through which convicted abusers retained the ability to purchase firearms. In January 2019, Klobuchar was one of forty senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill's background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, providing firearms as gifts to members of one's immediate family, firearms being transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense. In February 2018, after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Klobuchar was one of four Democratic senators to sign a letter to President Trump asserting that were he \\"to endorse legislation to require a background check on every gun purchase, without other poison pill provisions attached, we could finally move much closer towards the comprehensive system that you called for after the Stoneman Douglas attack\\" and that there was no justification in allowing individuals denied firearms by federally licensed dealers being able to \\"simply visit a gun show or go online to purchase the same gun that they were denied at the store.\\" In February 2019, Klobuchar was one of thirty-eight senators to sign a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham calling on him to \\"hold a hearing\\" on universal background checks and noted Graham's statement in the press that he \\"intended to have the Committee work on ‚Äòred flag‚Äô legislation and potentially also background checks\\", actions the senators indicated their support for. In May 2019, as Senate Democrats pressured Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow a vote on a bill to renew the Violence Against Women Act, which included an amendment closing the \\"boyfriend loophole\\" which barred those convicted of abusing, assaulting or stalking a dating partner from buying or owning a firearm, Klobuchar advocated for the Senate passing the bill and called the measure crucial to protect women in the United States who died from gun violence at larger rates there than in other high-income countries. At the Detroit Democratic debate on July 31, 2019, Klobuchar invoked the death of 6-year-old Stephen Romero in the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting and noted that President Trump supported background checks in a meeting before changing his position following a separate meeting with pro-gun group before stating that she would not fold if elected president and would secure the passage of universal background checks. Crime control According to her Senate website, while serving as Attorney of Hennepin County, Klobuchar was \\"a leading advocate for successful passage of Minnesota's first felony DWI law\\". (official Senate webpage, 2013) She also focused on the prosecution of violent and career criminals while serving as County Attorney. Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State Attorney General, praised Klobuchar's efforts for legislation against phone theft. In 2017 she took over sponsorship from Al Franken of a bill to provide grants for law enforcement personnel to receive training in how to question survivors of sexual assault and other trauma, after Franken was accused of sexual misconduct. In 2011, Klobuchar introduced S.978, the Commercial Felony Streaming Act, a bill that would make unauthorized streaming of copyrighted material for the purpose of \\"commercial advantage or personal financial gain\\" a felony under US copyright law. Backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and praised by industry groups, the legislation has been enormously unpopular among critics who believe it would apply to those who stream or post videos of copyrighted content on public sites such as YouTube. Economy Agriculture In March 2018, Klobuchar and Republican John Thune introduced the Agriculture Data Act, a bill that would direct the Secretary of Agriculture \\"to collect, collate, integrate, and link data relating to the impacts of covered conservation practices on enhancing crop yields, soil health, and otherwise reducing risk and improving farm and ranch profitability\\" in addition to granting the Agriculture Secretary the ability to form a data warehouse on the subjects of confidential cloud-based conservation and farm productivity that would reserve records of multiple analysis. Klobuchar stated that the bill would \\"ensure hardworking farmers are able to capitalize on the United States Department of Agriculture‚Äôs vast resources to streamline their operations, enhance yields, and increase profits.\\" In March 2019, Klobuchar was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \\"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\\" and urging his department to \\"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program.\\" In May 2019, Klobuchar and eight other Democratic senators sent a letter to Perdue in which they criticized the USDA for purchasing pork from JBS USA and wrote that it was \\"counterproductive and contradictory\\" for companies to receive funding from \\"U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this administration's trade policy.\\" The senators requested the department \\"ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer‚Äôs bottom line‚Äînot the business interests of foreign corporations.\\" Company mergers and regulations In February 2019, Klobuchar was one of eight senators to sign a letter to the Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice advocating for regulators to reject a proposed $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, writing that American enforcers have understood for the last 30 years \\"that fostering robust competition in telecommunications markets is the best way to provide every American with access to high-quality, cutting-edge communications at a reasonable price\\" and the merger would result in a return for \\"Americans to the dark days of heavily consolidated markets and less competition, with all of the resulting harms.\\" In March 2019, Klobuchar was one of six senators to sign a letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requesting it \\"use its rulemaking authority, along with other tools, in order to combat the scourge of non-compete clauses rigging our economy against workers\\" and espousing the view that non-compete clauses \\"harm employees by limiting their ability to find alternate work, which leaves them with little leverage to bargain for better wages or working conditions with their immediate employer.\\" The senators furthered that the FTC had the responsibility of protecting both consumers and workers and needed to \\"act decisively\\" to address their concerns over \\"serious anti-competitive harms from the proliferation of non-competes in the economy.\\" In June 2019, Klobuchar led six other Senate Democrats in signing letters to the FTC and the Department of Justice recounting that many of them had \\"called on both the FTC and the Justice Department to investigate potential anticompetitive activity in these markets, particularly following the significant enforcement actions taken by foreign competition enforcers against these same companies\\" and requested both agencies confirm whether or not opened antitrust investigations had been opened by them regarding each of the companies and for both agencies to pledge they will publicly release any such investigation's findings. Housing In April 2019, Klobuchar was one of forty-one senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \\"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\\" and expressing disappointment that President Trump's budget \\"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020. Labor laws In July 2019, Klobuchar signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta that advocated for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to initiate a full investigation into a complaint filed on May 20 by a group of Chicago-area employees of McDonald's, which detailed workplace violence incidents that included interactions with customers such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms and more. The senators argued that McDonald's could and needed to \\"do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace.\\" In July 2019, when asked by Royceann Porter of the Teamsters 238 union what she would do as president to stand up for temporary workers, Klobuchar replied that the first thing needed was to \\"make it easy for people to organize\\" and that union organizers would \\"have to explain to Iowa and to the rest of the country ‚Äî this president has not kept his promise to those workers where he said he was going to stand up for them.\\" Taxation In July 2017, during a tour of Canal Park Brewing as part of her promotion of a tax cut for microbreweries, Klobuchar said they were jobs in the United States that were not going anywhere and one thing needed was the encouragement of \\"more of these small businesses and especially these small breweries.\\" She acknowledged the tax cut had been introduced in the past, but stated the possibility of the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act being passed as part of broader tax reform scheduled for later that year. In 2019 Klobuchar was a sponsor of the Gold Star Family Tax Relief Act, a bill that would undo a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that raised the tax on the benefit children receive from a parent's Department of Defense survivor benefits plan up to 37% compared with an average of 12% to 15% prior to the 2017 tax bill. In a news release, Klobuchar reflected that when she \\"learned about the unacceptable mistake in the 2017 tax law that unduly burdened our Gold Star families, my colleagues and I moved immediately to fix the problem\\". The bill passed in the Senate in May 2019. Trade In 2010, Klobuchar opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership \\"because she [had] concerns about whether the proposed legislation [was] strong enough for American workers\\". Education In February 2019 Klobuchar came out against tuition free, four- year college for all, while saying she supports free community colleges. In March 2019, Klobuchar was one of 13 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Education Betsy Devos calling for the Education Department to do more to assist Argosy University students as they faced campus closures across the US and critiquing the Education Department as failing to provide adequate measures to protect students or keep them notified of ongoing updates. In July 2019, Klobuchar addressed the National Education Association, saying that her first plan was to increase pay for teachers that would be financed through changes to the estate tax and warned that the United States was \\"not going to compete with the rest of the world if we don‚Äôt invest in our schools.\\" Environment Climate change In December 2014, Klobuchar was one of six Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency urging the agency to give states more time to comply with its rule on power plants as the final rule \\"must provide adequate time for the design, permitting and construction of such large scale capital intensive infrastructure\\" and calling for an elimination of the 2020 targets in the final rule, a mandate that states take action by 2020 as part of the EPA's goal to reach a 30 percent carbon cut by 2030. In November 2018, the Trump administration released a climate change report warning of dire consequences if the US did not change its policies. The report was released the day after Thanksgiving, generally one of the slowest news days of the year. Klobuchar stated administration officials \\"couldn't pick a day where they tried to get less attention\\" and expressed her view that the attempt backfired given \\"a lot of people are signing up to get the overview of the report\\" as a result of no other news receiving attention the day the report was made public. She advocated for the implementation of greenhouse gas rules and gas mileage standards along with the United States reentering the Paris Agreement. In November 2018, Klobuchar was one of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution in response to findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action to address climate change. In a February 2019 interview with Bret Baier, Klobuchar was asked how she would vote on the Green New Deal if it came up for a vote in the Senate, replying, \\"I see it as aspirational, I see it as a jump start. So I would vote yes, but I would also, if it got down to the nitty- gritty of an actual legislation as opposed to, ‚Äòoh, here are some goals we have,‚Äô that would be different for me.\\" Klobuchar added that she was \\"for a jump-start of the discussion\\" as espoused in the Green New Deal's framework by fellow senator Ed Markey. In June 2019, Klobuchar was one of forty-four senators to introduce the International Climate Accountability Act, legislation that would prevent President Trump from using funds in an attempt to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and directing the president's administration to instead develop a strategic plan for the United States that would allow it to meet its commitment under the Paris Agreement. In June 2019, after Politico reported that the United States Department of Agriculture had mostly ceased promoting its own climate science, Klobuchar sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue requesting the Agriculture Department offer an explanation for not publicizing certain studies and called for an immediate release of \\"any [Agricultural Research Service] study related to climate science that was ignored, downplayed, or its findings held back.\\" Conservation In January 2017, Klobuchar was one of five senators to cosponsor a bill that would lift federal protections for gray wolves in both the Midwest and Wyoming in an attempt to prevent courts from overruling an Interior Department decision to remove wolves in Wyoming, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan from the endangered species list. In May 2019, Klobuchar and Republican James Risch reintroduced the Recreational Trails Program Funding Transparency Act, a bipartisan bill mandating the United States Secretary of Transportation give a report regarding the amount of non- highway recreational fuel taxes administered to the Recreational Trails Program for the purpose of assisting Congress in determining the appropriate funding level for the program. Klobuchar called environmental conservation \\"a fundamental part of Minnesota's heritage\\" and said the bill would \\"help ensure that states receive the resources they need to protect and improve these trails for generations to come.\\" Water pollution In May 2019, Klobuchar and Republican Marco Rubio introduced the Local Water Protection Act, a bipartisan bill that would reauthorize the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Section 319 grant program, which had provided funding opportunities for states to develop and implement their own programs for managing non-point source water pollution. The bill also increased funding for Section 319 from $70 million a year to $200 million for Fiscal Years 2020 through 2024. Klobuchar said her state took the quality of its \\"10,000 lakes very seriously, and we all want to preserve the quality of these important waterways for generations to come\\" and that the bill \\"would give local and state governments the resources they need to create the best voluntary conservation programs to ensure that their water is clean and free of harmful pollutants.\\" Wood building In May 2016, Klobuchar was a cosponsor of the Timber Innovation Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Mike Crapo and Debbie Stabenow that would incentivize investment by the National Forest Products Lab as well as American colleges and universities to conduct both research and development on alternative methods for wood building construction. The bill also supported attempts by the Agriculture Department to further support wood products being used as a building material for tall buildings. Government oversight Campaign finance In June 2019, Klobuchar and Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) introduced the Preventing Adversaries Internationally from Disbursing Advertising Dollars (PAID AD) Act, a bill that would modify U.S. federal campaign finance laws to outlaw the purchasing of ads that name a political candidate and appear on platforms by foreign nationals in the midst of an election year. Klobuchar issued a statement saying that the intelligence community had identified foreign powers as continuing to interfere in American elections and changing laws to ban foreign officials and governments from buying political advertisements \\"is necessary to ensure American elections are free and fair.\\" Election security In January 2017, Klobuchar was one of six Democratic senators to introduce legislation that would form an independent counsel with the ability to probe potential Russian cyber attacks on political systems and investigate efforts by Russians to interfere in American elections with roughly eighteen months to hand over its findings and recommendations to Congress. In February 2017, Klobuchar led 25 senators in signing a letter to the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) requesting that the commission detail cybersecurity challenges to state and local officials amid their attempts to safeguard future elections and also secure the 2016 election from Russian hackers. In June 2017, Klobuchar sent a letter to National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster requesting he meet with the Senate Rules Committee on the subject of allegations that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 election, citing the necessity of the Senate to \\"have all of the information necessary to ensure that future elections are safeguarded from foreign interference\\" amid its investigation into what extent Russia interfered in the election and called for McMaster to consider \\"making information that could be helpful to protecting critical infrastructure publicly available immediately.\\" In October 2017, Klobuchar and Virginia Senator Mark Warner unveiled the Honest Ads Act at a news conference, legislation that mandated large digital platforms keep a public repository of paid political advertising that appear on their sites and abolish \\"what has been a major discrepancy between how political activity is regulated online compared with broadcast television and radio.\\" The bill was in response to a revelation by Facebook, Inc. the previous month in which the company disclosed a discovery of roughly 500 inauthentic accounts responsible for more than $100,000 in advertising associated with the election and opined that the accounts were linked to Russia. On December 21, 2017, Klobuchar was one of six senators to introduce the Secure Elections Act, legislation authorizing block grants to states to update outdated voting technology as well as form a program for an independent panel of experts that would work toward the development of cybersecurity guidelines for election systems that states could then implement, along with offering states resources to install the recommendations. In June 2018, Klobuchar and Sherrod Brown introduced the Save Voters Act, a bill that would serve as an amendment to the National Voter Registration Act while asserting that a state cannot use an individual's failure to vote or respond to a state notice as reason for removing them from voter rolls. In reference to the Ohio Supreme Court ruling to uphold the state's \\"use it or lose it\\" policy the earlier that month, Klobuchar said, \\"We should be doing everything we can to encourage participation in elections and strengthen voting rights, yet last week's Supreme Court decision will allow states to make it harder ‚Äî not easier ‚Äî for more Americans to vote.\\" In August 2018, during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Klobuchar stated that President Trump's downplaying of Russian interference in the 2016 election posed a threat to national security and she wished he would listen to members of the intelligence community \\"but what we have right now is a common set of facts between at least Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and a common purpose to protect our democracy.\\" Klobuchar added that she would \\"love to see this broadened out so we start to discuss also the threats to our power grid system, the threats to our financial system, because the Russians aren't just stopping at the election equipment.\\" In November 2018, Klobuchar and Republican Dan Sullivan introduced legislation to create a new State Department program offering grants to American nonprofit groups for working on election security and sharing information with similar groups in other countries. In April 2019, Klobuchar was one of twelve Democratic senators to sign a letter led by Mazie Hirono that questioned the decision of Attorney General William Barr to offer \\"his own conclusion that the President‚Äôs conduct did not amount to obstruction of justice\\" and called for both the Justice Department's inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility to launch an investigation into whether Barr's summary of the Mueller Report and his April 18 news conference were misleading. During the June 27, 2019 Miami Democratic debate, Klobuchar warned, \\"We let the Republicans run our elections, and if we do not do something about Russian interference in the election, and we let Mitch McConnell stop all the back-up paper ballots, then we are not going to get to do what we want to do.\\" In July 2019, Klobuchar and Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed sent a letter to Acting Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan requesting an explanation of the actions taken by the DHS in response to \\"unexpected behavior\\" of voting equipment in Durham County, North Carolina during the 2016 presidential election and opined that it was \\"critical that we learn as much as we can about the extent of the attacks we faced in 2016, and that these lessons be shared as widely as possible so that our nation is fully prepared for the 2020 elections.\\" Government surveillance In August 2007, Klobuchar was one of 16 Democratic senators and 41 Democratic congresspeople to vote for the Protect America Act of 2007, which was heavily criticized by civil libertarians. Klobuchar did, however, vote against granting legal immunity to telecom corporations that cooperated with the NSA warrantless surveillance program. Klobuchar voted in favor of the Intelligence Authorization Act of 2008, which included a provision to ban the use of waterboarding by the United States. During the hearing of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, Klobuchar disagreed with Senator Tom Coburn (R-Oklahoma) when he questioned the nominee about his perception that Americans were \\"losing freedom\\" over the past 30 years. Klobuchar argued that the \\"free society\\" Coburn favored was one in which women were underrepresented in government, including no representation on the Supreme Court or the Senate Judiciary Committee. Census In June 2019, Klobuchar was one of 28 senators to sign a letter led by Brian Schatz to United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross warning that Ross would \\"further delay and jeopardize the Census Bureau‚Äôs ability to conduct a full, fair, and accurate decennial census as required by the U.S. Constitution and the Census Act\\" by continuing to attempt adding the citizenship question to 2020 census materials. The senators urged Ross to \\"allow the Census Bureau to proceed with preparation for a 2020 census without a citizenship question on the questionnaire.\\" Government shutdown In March 2019, Klobuchar and thirty-eight other senators signed a letter to the Appropriations Committee opining that contractor workers and by extension their families \\"should not be penalized for a government shutdown that they did nothing to cause\\" while noting that there were bills in both chambers of Congress that if enacted would provide back pay to compensate contractor employees for lost wages before urging the Appropriations Committee \\"to include back pay for contractor employees in a supplemental appropriations bill for FY2019 or as part of the regular appropriations process for FY2020.\\" Foreign policy Klobuchar with Lindsey Graham and John McCain in Latvia in 2016 In March 2007, Klobuchar went on an official trip to Iraq with Senate colleagues Sheldon Whitehouse, John E. Sununu, and Lisa Murkowski. She noted that U.S. troops were completing their job and working arduously to train the Iraqis. Klobuchar opposed President George W. Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq in January 2007. In May 2007, after Bush vetoed a bill (which Klobuchar voted for) that would fund the troops but impose time limits on the Iraq War, and supporters failed to garner enough congressional votes to override his veto, Klobuchar voted for additional funding for Iraq without such time limits, saying she \\"simply could not stomach the idea of using our soldiers as bargaining chips\\". In December 2010, Klobuchar voted for the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years, and providing for a continuation of on- site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years. In 2011, Klobuchar supported American military intervention in Libya. In October 2016, Klobuchar was one of 12 senators to sign a letter to President Barack Obama urging his administration \\"to consider all options for increasing China‚Äôs compliance with its international trade obligations, including a potential case brought with our allies at the World Trade Organization and a pause of other trade negotiations with China, such as the Bilateral Investment Treaty talk\\" and asserting that U.S. steel companies and steelworkers would only get the relief they needed though the implementation of \\"strong enforcement measures into our strategy to reduce excess global capacity\\". In March 2017, Klobuchar and Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) introduced a bill that would mandate the Defense Department reclassify deployments to the Sinai Peninsula as combat zone assignments, complete with the corresponding tax breaks that come from the proposed arrangement. Klobuchar observed, \\"As terrorist groups like ISIS spread throughout the region, the dangers these service members face has increased. Current rules regarding benefits for those serving in the Sinai do not reflect these new threats.\\" In November 2017, in response to efforts by China to purchase tech companies based in the US, Klobuchar was one of nine senators to cosponsor a bill that would broaden the federal government's ability to prevent foreign purchases of U.S. firms through increasing the strength of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The scope of the CFIUS would be expanded to allow it to review along with possibly decline smaller investments and add additional national security factors for CFIUS to consider including if information about Americans would be exposed as part of transactions or whether the deal would facilitate fraud. In May 2018, Klobuchar was one of 12 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to remain in the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that \\"Iran could either remain in the agreement and seek to isolate the United States from our closest partners, or resume its nuclear activities\\" if the US pulled out and that both possibilities \\"would be detrimental to our national security interests.\\" In March 2018, Klobuchar voted against tabling a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda. In October 2018, Klobuchar was one of eight senators to sign a letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats requesting a classified briefing on what the intelligence community knew about threats to Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi so that the senators may fulfill their \\"oversight obligation\\". In January 2019, following Juan Guaid√≥'s self-declaration as interim President of Venezuela, Klobuchar told HuffPost that she supported the opposition to Nicol√°s Maduro. In February 2019, Klobuchar supported the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which would make it legal for states to refuse to do business with contractors that engage in boycotts against Israel. In April 2019, Klobuchar was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to President Trump encouraging him \\"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\\", asserting that Trump had \\"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\\" since becoming president and that he was \\"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\\" through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., citing the funding's helping to improve conditions in those countries. Klobuchar supports ending all U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Health and safety Drug policy In June 2016, along with Republicans Chuck Grassley and Mike Lee and fellow Democrat Patrick Leahy, Klobuchar was one of four senators to introduce a bill that would authorize generic manufacturers facing either the Food and Drug Administration being misused by brand-name drug companies in order to prevent them from getting drug samples or an inability to share a safety protocol to file a lawsuit that would mandate access to a sample or force negotiations for a safety protocol. The bill's intent was to prevent big pharmaceutical companies from using safety rules in an attempt to prevent generic drugs from coming to market. In November 2016, along with Chuck Grassley and Richard Blumenthal, Klobuchar sent a letter to Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch expressing concern that Mylan may have overcharged military members for EpiPen and questioned when Mylan would reimburse the Defense Department. In December 2016, Klobuchar was one of 17 senators to sign a letter to President-elect Trump asking him to fulfill a campaign pledge to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, stating their willingness \\"to advance measures to achieve this goal\\", and calling on Trump \\"to partner with Republicans and Democrats alike to take meaningful steps to address the high cost of prescription drugs through bold administrative and legislative actions.\\" In February 2017, Klobuchar and thirty other senators signed a letter to Kal√©o Pharmaceuticals in response to the opioid-overdose-reversing device Evzio rising in price from $690 in 2014 to $4,500 and requested the company answer what the detailed price structure for Evzio was, the number of devices Kal√©o Pharmaceuticals set aside for donation, and the totality of federal reimbursements Evzio received in the previous year. In March 2017, Klobuchar was one of twenty-one senators to sign a letter led by Ed Markey to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell which noted that 12 percent of adult Medicaid beneficiaries had some form or a substance abuse disorder in addition to one third of treatment administered for opioid and other substance use disorders in the United States being financed through Medicaid and opined that the American Health Care Act could \\"very literally translate into a death spiral for those with opioid use disorders\\" due to the insurance coverage lacking and not having the adequate funds to afford care oftentimes resulting in individuals abandoning substance use disorder treatment. In June 2018, Klobuchar co-sponsored the bipartisan STATES Act proposed in the 115th U.S. Congress by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Colorado Senator Cory Gardner that would exempt individuals or corporations in compliance with state cannabis laws from federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act. In February 2018, Klobuchar introduced the CARA 2.0, a follow-up bill to the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) that included imposing a three-day initial prescribing limit on opioids for acute pain along with increasing services to promote recovery and attempting to widen the availability of treatment. At a news conference, Klobuchar described CARA 2.0 as \\"a blueprint for the country in terms of training on naloxone and in terms of authorization for money.\\" In December 2018, Klobuchar was one of 21 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb stating their approval of the actions of the Food and Drugs Administration to hinder youth access to e-cigarettes and urging the FDA \\"to take additional, stronger steps to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use among youth.\\" In January 2019, Catherine Cortez Masto announced that she and Klobuchar were sponsoring legislation authorizing \\"the largest purchaser of prescription medications, Medicare, to negotiate drug prices and to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for the rising prices of prescription drugs.\\" In June 2019, Klobuchar was one of fifteen senators to introduce the Affordable Medications Act, legislation intended to promote transparency through mandating pharmaceutical companies disclose the amount of money going toward research and development in addition to both marketing and executives' salaries. The bill also abolished the restriction that stopped the federal Medicare program from using its buying power to negotiate lower drug prices for beneficiaries and hinder drug company monopoly practices used to keep prices high and disable less expensive generics entering the market. Food policy When the Healthy Hungry-Free Kids Act of 2010 raised the possibility that pizza sauce would no longer be counted as a serving of vegetables in school lunches, threatening the $3 billion-dollar Schwan Company of Minnesota, Klobuchar, along with Minnesota Senator Al Franken and six Minnesota representatives, petitioned the USDA not to change the rating of tomato paste. The proposed change didn't pass. Health insurance Klobuchar voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009 and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. In December 2012, she advocated to \\"repeal or reduce\\" the tax on medical devices included in the Affordable Care Act, as it would be harmful to businesses in her state. Despite this, on September 30, 2013, Klobuchar voted to remove a provision that would repeal the medical device tax from a government funding bill in opposition to the provision being used as a condition in keeping the government open. In January 2015, Klobuchar was one of 17 senators to co-sponsor S. 149, a bill to retroactively repeal the device excise tax.United States. Cong. Senate. 114th Congress, 1st Session. S. 149, To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on medical devices. [introduced in the U.S. Senate; January 13, 2015]. GPO. March 9, 2015.

In December 2018, after U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional, Klobuchar called the ruling \\"absurd\\" and said that at a time when the Trump administration \\"seems bound and determined to take away people's health care, we have to protect the ability of people to even have their health care even exist.\\" In December 2018, Klobuchar was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \\"increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre- existing conditions.\\" The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \\"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress.\\" In January 2019, during the 2018‚Äì19 United States federal government shutdown, Klobuchar was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the shutdown's effect on the public health and employees while remaining alarmed \\"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency‚Äôs employees and the safety and security of the nation‚Äôs food and medical products.\\" In February 2019, Klobuchar was one of twenty-three Democratic senators to introduce the State Public Option Act, a bill that would authorize states to form a Medicaid buy-in program for all residents and thereby grant all denizens of the state the ability to buy into a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan if they wished. Brian Schatz, a bill cosponsor, said the legislation would \\"unlock each state‚Äôs Medicaid program to anyone who wants it, giving people a high-quality, low-cost public health insurance option\\" and that its goal was \\"to make sure that every single American has comprehensive health care coverage.\\" In August 2019, Klobuchar was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to aid in the comprehension of states and Congress on potential consequences in the event that the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act (ACA) lawsuit prevailed in courts, citing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form \\"an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets\\". Railroad safety In June 2019, Klobuchar was one of ten senators to cosponsor the Safe Freight Act, a bill that would mandate all freight trains have one or more certified conductors and one certified engineer on board who can collaborate on how to protect both the train and people living near the tracks' safety. The legislation was meant to correct a rollback of the Federal Railroad Administration on a proposed rule intended to establish safety standards. Recreation advocacy Klobuchar has been an active supporter of outdoor recreation legislation, including the Recreational Trails Program (RTP). When the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed MAP-21, trail interests and state park officials warned that the new policy could effectively end the program by relegating recreational trail projects to competition for funding among a broad category of authorized non-highway projects. Klobuchar led efforts to alter the proposal, working closely with recreation interests to develop a floor amendment that would reauthorize the RTP program unchanged. Although she faced bipartisan leadership in support of the committee's proposal, Klobuchar managed to secure acceptance of her new language by the legislation's floor manager, and she won strong bipartisan support for her amendment. The result was Senate passage in early 2012 of new surface transportation legislation, which continued RTP with $85 million in guaranteed annual funds and no significant change in its operations. As chair of the Subcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion, she played a key role in the 2010 passage of the Travel Promotion Act and the creation of Brand USA, an advertising effort to recover the traditional U.S. share of the international tourism market that will highlight national parks and their natural treasures. With Klobuchar's active support, the program has been granted $100 million per annum in matching federal funding, is widely expected to bring millions of additional visitors and billions of dollars to the U.S. and its parks each year, and has become the focus of a major White House initiative. Klobuchar at Twin Cities Pride Parade in 2018 On June 6, 2012, Klobuchar received the Sheldon Coleman Great Outdoors Award at a special Great Outdoors Week celebration presented by the American Recreation Coalition. The award, created in 1989 to honor the lifelong efforts of Sheldon Coleman, is presented to individuals whose personal efforts have contributed substantially to enhancing outdoor experiences across America. The winner is selected by a panel of 100 national recreation community leaders, ranging from corporate executives to key federal and state officials and nonprofit organization community leaders. Klobuchar is the fifth woman, and the first woman serving in Congress, to receive the honor.  Immigration  In January 2013, Klobuchar was one of four senators to sponsor the Immigration Innovation Act, legislation intended to increase STEM visas and use the fees obtained from the aforementioned visa applications as a means of funding STEM education programs within the US. In a July 2018 interview, when asked about eliminating Immigration and Customs Enforcement amid other Democrats supporting abolishing the agency, Klobuchar stated, \\"I think what has to change are the policies, and the people that are making these policies are making horrendous decisions like separating kids from their parents.\\" She added that the US would always \\"need immigration enforcement\\" and referred to America as \\"a major country with major borders\\", thereafter condemning the Trump administration's rhetoric on immigration: \\"I am just appalled by how this administration has been talking about immigrants. They don't diminish America, they are America.\\" In January 2019, Klobuchar was one of 20 senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill banning the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from passing information collected on DACA recipients to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Justice, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies. In April 2019, Klobuchar signed a letter led by Catherine Cortez Masto to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Enforcement asserting that \\"the civil detention of an expectant mother for potential immigration offenses is never justified\\" due to the \\"absence of compelling evidence that the detention of a pregnant woman is necessary because she is a threat to herself or others, or is a threat to public safety or national security\\". The senators requested the CBP enact measures that would ensure \\"timely and appropriate treatment\\" for pregnant women in custody along with both agencies providing information on how available facilities and doctors are for pregnant immigrants and complete data on the number of those currently in custody. In April 2019, Klobuchar was one of nineteen senators to sign a letter to top members on the Appropriations Committee Richard Shelby and Patrick Leahy and top members of its Homeland Security subcommittee Shelley Moore Capito and Jon Tester indicating that they could not \\"support the appropriation of funds that would expand this administration‚Äôs unnecessarily cruel immigration enforcement policies, its inhumane immigrant detention systems, or its efforts to build the president‚Äôs vanity projects\\" and urging Congress to \\"resist efforts to raid critical and effective public safety programs in order to pay for political theatrics\\" as President Trump's \\"manufactured emergency\\" was not justification for \\"spending taxpayer dollars on an ineffective wall.\\" In May 2019, President Trump announced an immigration plan that would move the U.S. toward a \\"merit-based\\" system favoring highly skilled workers over migrants with family members living here, Klobuchar responding that she was bothered by the plan due to \\"the fact that he doesn‚Äôt deal with the Dreamers, he doesn‚Äôt deal with the millions of people who came here with no fault of their own, he doesn‚Äôt deal with the 10 million people that are here now, many of whom would like to see if they follow the law, learn English, they want to be on a path to citizenship.\\" In June 2019, following the Housing and Urban Development Department's confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federal backed loans, Klobuchar and eleven other senators introduced The Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to the immigration status of an applicant. In June 2019, Klobuchar and six other Democratic senators were led by Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz in sending letters to the Government Accountability Office along with the suspension and debarment official and inspector general at the US Department of Health and Human Services citing recent reports that showed \\"significant evidence that some federal contractors and grantees have not provided adequate accommodations for children in line with legal and contractual requirements\\" and urged officials in the government to determine whether federal contractors and grantees are in violation of contractual obligations or federal regulations and should thus face financial consequences. In July 2019, along with Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, Klobuchar sent a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement asserting that the agency \\"should be prioritizing reunification of every child as soon as possible as opposed to prolonging stays in government custody. In July 2019, following reports that the Trump administration intended to end protections of spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members from deportation, Klobuchar was one of twenty-two senators to sign a letter led by Tammy Duckworth arguing that the program allowed service members the ability \\"to fight for the United States overseas and not worry that their spouse, children, or parents will be deported while they are away\\" and that the program's termination would cause both personal hardship and a negatively impact for service members in combat. In July 2019, Klobuchar and fifteen other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor ahead of engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations with the exception of special circumstances and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to report annually regarding enforcement actions in those locations.  Journalism  In July 2019, Klobuchar was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act, a bill introduced by Ben Cardin and Rob Portman that would create a new memorial that would be privately funded and constructed on federal lands within Washington, D.C. in order to honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters that have died in the line of duty. Social issues Child care In 2019, Klobuchar and 34 other senators introduced the Child Care for Working Families Act, a bill that created 770,000 new child care jobs and that ensured families under 75 percent of the state median income did not pay for child care with higher earning families having to pay \\"their fair share for care on a sliding scale, regardless of the number of children they have.\\" The legislation also supported universal access to high- quality preschool programs for all 3 and 4-year-olds and gave the child care workforce a changed compensation and training to aid both teachers and caregivers. Children's programming In 2019, following the announcement by the Federal Communications Commission of rules changes to children's programming through modifying the Children's Television Act of 1990, Klobuchar and eight other Democratic senators signed a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai that expressed concern that the proposed changes \\"would limit the reach of educational content available to children and have a particular damaging effect on youth in low-income and minority communities\\" and asserted that the new rules would see a reduction in access to valuable educational content through over-the-air services. LGBT rights In May 2017, Klobuchar was one of 46 senators to introduce the Equality Act of 2017, described by Representative David Cicilline as ensuring \\"that every LGBT person can live their lives free from the fear of discrimination. Above all, it‚Äôs about honoring the values that have guided our nation since its founding. It‚Äôs critical that Congress pass the Equality Act into law.\\" Human trafficking Klobuchar has sponsored and co-sponsored several pieces of legislation aimed at stopping human trafficking that have become law, including the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act; the No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act; S.2974 (which funded the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline); and the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015. Worker's rights In March 2018, along with Kirsten Gillibrand and Patty Murray, Klobuchar led a letter signed by all 22 female U.S. Senators to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that called for changes to a 1995 statute that formed the present policy for addressing workplace misconduct complaints on Capitol Hill and specified their support for an update to the policy that would streamline the process of reporting sexual harassment in addition to granting staffers more resources in filing reports. In April 2019, Klobuchar signed onto the Be HEARD Act, legislation intended to abolish the tipped minimum wage along with ending mandatory arbitration and pre-employment nondisclosure agreements. The bill also gave workers additional time to report harassment and was said by co- sponsor Patty Murray to come at a time when too many workers are \\"still silenced by mandatory disclosure agreements that prevent them from discussing sexual harassment and longstanding practices like the tipped wages that keep workers in certain industries especially vulnerable.\\" Veterans In December 2018, Klobuchar was one of 21 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie calling it \\"appalling that the VA is not conducting oversight of its own outreach efforts\\" even though suicide prevention is the VA's highest clinical priority, and requesting that Wilkie \\"consult with experts with proven track records of successful public and mental health outreach campaigns with a particular emphasis on how those individuals measure success.\\" In 2019, Klobuchar and Marco Rubio unveiled the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, a bill aimed at assisting veterans who are going back into the workforce through directing the National Science Foundation to advocate for veterans to study and pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). The bill also mandated the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) create a working group that would organize programs of the federal government to help with transitioning and training of veterans for STEM careers. The bill unanimously cleared the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in July 2019. Klobuchar stated that she was satisfied by the bill passing in the committee as it would allow them to \\"help support veterans in their transition to civilian life‚Äì benefiting veterans, their families, communities, and our whole economy.\\" In March 2019, Klobuchar and Republican Thom Tillis introduced the Newborn Care Improvement Act, a bill that if enacted would double the number of days from seven to fourteen that veterans receive to care for their newborns as present law did not allow the baby health insurance if the parent was unable to find outside care after the first week. Klobuchar stated the sacrifices made by service members and that the bill \\"will help provide men and women in the military with the resources they need to start a happy, healthy family.\\" Technology Cyber bullying Klobuchar was one of 14 co-sponsors, led by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, of the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2017. The law added additional online protections aimed at children to those provided by the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008 (which had 60 cosponsors, including Klobuchar, and was sponsored by Joe Biden). She also co-sponsored the KIDS Act of 2008, which adds protections against online sexual predators who target children, alongside 20 other senators led by Chuck Schumer. Data privacy In June 2019, Klobuchar and Republican Lisa Murkowski introduced the Protecting Personal Health Data Act, legislation mandating the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services create regulations for apps that track health data, wearable devices, and genetic testing kits in addition to forming a National Task Force on Health Data Protection that would evaluate and give a position on potential cybersecurity and privacy risks related to consumer products using customer health data. In a statement, Klobuchar said new technology had \\"made it easier for people to monitor their own health, but health tracking apps and home DNA testing kits have also given companies access to personal, private data with limited oversight.\\" In October 2018, Klobuchar and Catherine Cortez Masto sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai charging Google with failing \\"[to] protect consumers‚Äô data\\" while keeping \\"consumers in the dark about serious security risks\\" and noting that Google had not found evidence of developers taking advantage of this vulnerability or that profile data was misused. Klobuchar and Mastro expressed their dismay \\"that more care was not taken to inform consumers about threats to their personal information.\\" Net neutrality In December 2017, in response to the Federal Communication Commission's repeal of net neutrality rules, Klobuchar said, \\"It‚Äôs against the concept of the internet, which was all about letting everyone access the internet and letting everyone be able to compete on an equal playing field.\\" In February 2018, during a discussion with Mayor of Duluth Emily Larson, Klobuchar stated that net neutrality \\"is not just about one company having access, it's about everyone having equal access\\" and they \\"want small- and mid-size cities like Duluth to be able to compete against metro areas where they might be able to have the benefits of being bigger.\\" In April 2018, Klobuchar, fellow Minnesota senator Tina Smith, and Ed Markey met with local business owners, experts and advocates to discuss the Congressional Review Act resolution and its potential to overturn the FCC's net neutrality repeal. Klobuchar said that Senate approval of the resolution would give it momentum to get passed in the House. In May 2018, Klobuchar voted for a bill that would reinstate net neutrality rules and thereby overturn the FCC's repeal via a law authorizing Congress to reverse regulatory actions by a simple majority vote. Telecommunications In April 2019, Klobuchar, Tina Smith, and Patty Murray introduced the Digital Equity Act of 2019, legislation establishing a $120 million grant program that would fund both the creation and implementation of \\"comprehensive digital equity plans\\" in each U.S. state along with providing a $120 million grant program to give support toward projects developed by individuals and groups. The bill also gave the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) the role of evaluating and providing guidance toward digital equity projects. Klobuchar argued that the bill would provide communities across the US with high-speed internet.

Since it was established, Laguna has published over 4.500 titles.  History  In early 1998, Dejan Papiƒá, who was a computer programmer at the time, translated Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic, so that his wife could read it in their native language. However, when he tried to acquire the rights for the title, he learned he couldn't do so as an individual and that he needed the help of a publishing house instead. Soon after that, in April 1998, Mr. Papiƒá founded his own publishing house, Laguna. During its initial years, the publishing company faced a bombing, a social crisis and lack of funds, so it progressed at a slow pace. Only one title was published in the first year, two the following and four the year after that. In the year 2000, Laguna began publishing titles by other authors popular worldwide. The list of publications grew year after year, only to reach 350 published titles a year, thus becoming one of the most productive publishing companies in Europe.  Authors and publications  Laguna's first editions were titles by one of the most popular British authors, Terry Pratchett. Today, some of this publisher's foreign language titles include the names of classic authors (Shakespeare, Goethe, Gogol, Chekhov, Kafka, Proust, Musil) and numerous contemporary writers with works mostly from English, Spanish, German, French and Russian speaking territories such as: Nobel winners Mario Vargas Llosa, Herta Muller, Jos√© Saramago, Gunter Grass, Toni Morrison, Czeslaw Milosz, Mo Yan, Svetlana Alexievich, George Eliot, Max Frisch, Mark Aldanov, Sylvia Plath, Agatha Christie, Henry Miller, Hans Fallada, John Cheever, Bret Easton Ellis, Amin Maalouf, Ana Mar√≠a Matute, Tony Parsons, Roberto Bola√±o, Margaret Atwood, Martin Walser, Bill Bryson, Khaled Hosseini, Victor Pelevin, Lucinda Riley and many others.

A Lifetime Member of the Actors Studio and a graduate of the Canadian Film Centre's Directors Lab in Toronto, she is also a recipient of the award, Women in the Director's Chair Career Advancement Module 2010, in collaboration with Women in Film Festival Vancouver, among many other honours. She is a member of the Winnipeg Film Group and chair of their Board. Early life Growing up in Winnipeg in the 1950s and 1960s, Shelagh Carter had a troubled relationship with her mother Barbara (Babs) Carter, which many years later served as the basis of her first feature film Passionflower. There is a family history of mental illness going back to Carter's grandmother. In interviews, Carter asserted that Passionflower was her own story, that her experience of her mother is \\"85 to 95 percent\\" of what is seen on the screen: > A lot of women at the time, an era of being perfect, staying in the home, > repressed their anger from not being able to express themselves. The mental > health industry at the time made women the problem and treated them with > electroshock therapy. It is not clear what form of mental illness Barbara Carter had: \\"Terms were thrown around, schizophrenic, manic-depressive. People today would say bipolar, but I don't even know if that was my mother.\\" Carter recalled the first time she saw how her mother \\"broke down\\", \\"pounding on the floor\\", the nine-year-old Carter in her pyjamas. Shelagh Carter's father, Dennis H. Carter, \\"was a product of the notably progressive faculty of architecture\\" at the University of Manitoba, where he \\"thrived\\", and, in 1967, co-founded the architectural firm of Smith Carter Katelnikoff, a firm \\"at the centre of Winnipeg's architectural renewal\\". As Winnipeg built with design meant to reflect the times, Dennis Carter was behind the lens of his 8mm camera, shooting reels and reels of film: \\"I have very fond memories of sitting at a dining room table with him when I was a very little girl with him editing the Super 8.\\" Her father, however, was often at a loss when it came to her mother's moods, not knowing what to do; the young Carter became a \\"daddy's girl\\": \\"He thought he was being a great dad, but it set up this competition. What would happen is everything my mum would attempt would never get finished. But I was drawing and winning these prizes at school but it seemed if I showed her something, she would dismiss it.\\" When Carter was eighteen years old, when she was \\"really struggling\\" with her mother, a teacher pulled her out of class one day and took her to see a film, which happened to be John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence: > And I'm looking up at the screen ... and I think, \\"My God, that's my > mother.\\" And people started to laugh behind me, they began to laugh at her. > And ... I swear to God, I was up over those seats, I was gonna deck them, I > was so mad. My teacher was pulling me off of them. And it was at that > moment, at 18, that I realized that I loved my mother. Later, she elaborated: \\"That's when I knew I really loved my mother and I was beginning to see that it was an illness and it wasn't her.\\" Education Carter moved to New York City after graduating with a degree in interior design from the University of Manitoba in 1976. At some point, Carter's interests realigned towards the stage, and she studied acting in Los Angeles and New York. In 1995, Carter attended the Actors Studio's School of Drama (The New School), which had begun offering a Master of Fine Arts degree a year earlier. Carter graduated with an MFA in Directing in 1998, a member of the second graduating class. Career in theatre and film On her return to Canada in 1998, Carter founded Casting in Stone Inc., to provide casting director services in film and television. The same year, Carter began an academic career at the University of Winnipeg in the Theatre and Film Department. She has said it was not planned; it just \\"happened\\" to her. Short film director The first of Carter's own short films was The Darkling Plain (2002), which was recognized and honoured in cities across Canada, followed by the experimental narrative film Rifting/Blue (2005), the first of several collaborations with writer and University of Winnipeg colleague Deborah Schnitzer, and which won world festival recognition. Her third short, Night Travellers (2007), was a National Screen Institute Drama Prize winner in 2007. In 2008, The Canadian Film Centre in Toronto invited Carter to participate in an exclusive workshop intensive (the Directors Lab, Short Dramatic Film programme) to develop film projects along with a handful of other Canadian professionals; her project was chosen for development by the Centre with $250,000 in production support. With the support of the University of Winnipeg, Carter directed and completed her award-winning 35mm short One Night in the summer of 2009; it screened at several international film festivals. This was followed swiftly by two more collaborations with Deborah Schnitzer: Resolve (2009), a dance film, and Canoe (2010), based on Schnitzer's novel Jane Dying Again, an experimental narrative film which won world festival recognition. The same year, Carter was selected to attend the Women in the Director's Chair Career Advancement Module presented in collaboration with the Vancouver International Women in Film Festival. Feature film director Carter's first feature film originated during her time at the CFC, the autobiographical Passionflower (2011), and won film festival attention and honours. The film solidified her position as one of Canada's leading practitioners of psychological melodrama. 3D film, move to Bangladesh, and Rana Plaza Carter directed another experimental short film, Is It My Turn (2012), a 3D black and white dance film, again winning festival recognition. Her feature projects were put on hiatus following the Rana Plaza Collapse on 24 April 2013, when Carter's husband, Brad Loewen, was given the responsibility of implementing the Accord signed by Western clothing manufacturers upgrading the safety features of 1600 Bangladeshi garment factories; they both moved to Dhaka in December 2013 for an expected five-year term. This led to Carter producing a short documentary, Rana Plaza: Let Not the Hope Die (2014), commemorating the one-year anniversary of the tragedy, \\"to support his work\\". Is It My Turn was screened in Dhaka at the request of the Canadian High Commission in January 2015, with Carter in attendance. In August 2015, she was described as living there \\"part-time\\". As of July 2016, Loewen was still chief safety inspector for the project. Return to feature films Carter's second feature (and fourth collaboration with Schnitzer), Before Anything You Say (2017) is an experimental domestic drama film about a couple struggling to maintain their love and marriage even as a life-altering decision threatens to tear them apart. The film is once more partly autobiographical, based on her feelings about her husband accepting the position which took him to Bangladesh: \\"he was gone and here I was, in the prairies, by myself, in the place he wanted to move to.\\" The film toured mainly in Europe in 2017 and 2018, almost overlapping with the release of her third feature, and won a handful of awards ahead of its Canadian premiere at the Gimli Film Festival in 2018, where Carter was presented with an award by the Directors Guild of Canada. Carter's third feature, Into Invisible Light (2018) is loosely based on characters from Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, specifically Yelena and Dr. Astrov. The story is about a recent widow re-examining her life and her identity in the wake of her husband's death, unexpectedly crossing paths with an old flame from her past, inspired to take up writing years after having given it up. Carter's fourth feature film is the romantic comedy Love, Repeat, which premiered in New York City on 17 December 2019. Projects in development Over the years, there have been reports of Carter working on various feature projects: a prairie noir film called The Shooting Party; a psychological thriller called Skinner, written by Rebecca Gibson, about a detective who works with child victims of Internet exploitation who begins to suspect abuse in her own family; a humanistic comedy called Dreaming of Tempests; an allegory called La Jefa; most recently, The Woman Who Swallowed West Hawk Lake, a psychological thriller, is said to be in development. Directing style and aesthetics Carter's experiences as an actress in New York and Los Angeles led her to want to become an actor herself and to develop her own method of directing: > I discovered a lot of directors didn't know how to talk to actors. They were > much more technically minded and they would talk to an actor ‚Ä¶ and I knew > from my training as an actor that doesn't help an actor. It's a process ... > You have to be able to help them get into character and not tell them \\"cry > here.\\" Carter said in 2012 that she tries to achieve \\"truth on the screen\\": \\"I really want people to feel they are actually looking at a situation, it isn't cinema v√©rit√©, but I hope it's truthful. Therefore you don't 'see' any acting.\\" Carter says she has been told her style of filmmaking is more akin to European cinema, in that she is willing to let the film take its time and focus on older characters, and suggests that Europeans \\"value older people in their lives\\" more than North Americans, although she says \\"we are getting better at it\\", perhaps because the Baby Boomers are getting older. Personal life In an interview, Carter described leaving home for New York City as having \\"escaped\\" her family, but there was an incident in New York: \\"I was walking in Greenwich Village, 8th Street, and there was a moment when my body cut off, and I was suddenly in a silent movie. I knew then that I had to deal with my feelings.\\" She underwent psychoanalysis. In her thirties, having returned from New York, she tried talking to her mother, who was \\"having a bad time again.\\" She asked her mother if she loved her and her mother said: \\"Dear, it's so hard for me to talk about these things.\\" Carter knew her mother did love her \\"ultimately\\", but, she said, \\"boy, we missed each other on some level.\\" By the time of the release of Passionflower, however, over the previous ten to fifteen years, her mother's mental health had become \\"much better\\" and Carter's parents \\"had some good time together.\\" Looking back at her filmmaking career after the release of Before Anything You Say, Carter said she realized that her films were all \\"in some way\\" about betrayal and abandonment, and that this was \\"something really deep in me from my own childhood, coming up in different forms.\\" Carter's husband Brad Loewen and stepson Erik Friesen appear in a few of her films as a main cast member (Rifting/Blue) or an extra (Passionflower). Sheila O'Malley has been friends with Carter since their time together as students at The New School. Carter has tended to work with many of the same collaborators and crew over several films, developing close bonds. For example, she has been collaborating with Deborah Schnitzer since Rifting/Blue (2005). She thinks of cinematographer Ousama Rawi, who first worked with Carter on One Night, as \\"a great mentor\\". Carter resides in West St Paul, Manitoba, north of Winnipeg. She took an early retirement from her position at the University of Winnipeg \\"to concentrate all her energies on filmmaking\\" in May 2019.

The division was formed with the Western Front in July 1942 from the 1st Guards Red Banner Rifle Brigade as the 1st Guards Red Banner Rifle Division.Poirer and Connor, Red Army Order of Battle in the Great Patriotic War (1985). The division in the process of formation was temporarily called the '1st Guards Red Banner Rifle Division' (formed 1942) from July 6, 1942 to September 13, 1942. Units of the division included the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Guards Rifle Regiments. On 13 September 1942 the division became the 42nd Guards Red Banner Rifle Division. On 1 October 1942 it was part of the Western Front reserves; by 1 November 1942 it had been shifted into 20th Army,Combat composition of the Soviet Army seemingly as part of the Battles of Rzhev. It eventually fought at Stalingrad, Kursk, Kiev, Iasi, and Budapest; gained the 'Prilukskaya' honorific 13 February 1944 after the liberation of Pryluky; and it was serving with the 1st Guards Cavalry- Mechanized Group of the 2nd Ukrainian Front at the end of the war in May 1945. The division also served with the 5th; 31st; 5th Guards; 40th Army (September ‚Äî November 1943 and December 1943 ‚Äî March 1945); and the 53rd Armies by the end of the war. The 42nd Gv Tank Division was formed from the 42 GRD on 4 June 1957 at Gvardeyskoye, Dnepropetrovsk Oblast. It was part of the 6th Guards Tank Army throughout its existence. The division became the 6299th Base for Storage of Weapons and Equipment (VKhVT) on 1 September 1990; probably actually the 6299th Guards VKhVT.

City of South Portland is a lawsuit filed on February 6, 2015, in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. It involved a pipeline operator's challenge to South Portland, Maine's local ordinance prohibiting loading crude oil onto tankers and the construction of new structures for that purpose on the grounds that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause and Foreign Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Decision After a four-day bench trial, the court ruled on August 24, 2018 that the local ordinance does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause or the Foreign Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The federal district court for the District of Maine ruled that the City of South Portland's ordinance prohibiting the loading of crude oil onto tankers and related activities and structures did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause or the Foreign Commerce Clause. The ordinance, known as the ‚ÄúClean Skies Ordinance,‚Äù was adopted after a pipeline operator (the plaintiff in this case) made plans to reverse the flow in a pipeline that extended from the harbor in South Portland to refineries in Quebec so that instead of transporting crude oil from the harbor to the refineries, the pipeline could transport crude oil from Canada to the harbor for shipment. Concerns regarding local pollution and other local impacts were raised in response to these plans, as well as concerns regarding climate change. The Clear Skies Ordinance's stated purposes are to ‚Äúencourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality‚Äù; ‚Äúto protect citizens and visitors from harmful effects caused by air pollutants‚Äù; ‚Äúto promote a wholesome home environment‚Äù; and ‚Äúto conserve natural resources.‚Äù The district court found that the ordinance did not regulate extraterritorially even if it had effects on the functions of the pipeline company's infrastructure outside the city. The court was not persuaded by the pipeline operator's arguments that the ordinance had an ‚Äúextraterritorial purpose,‚Äù including arguments that members of the public had cited the pipeline's potential impacts outside the city, including concerns about continued reliance on fossil fuels causing global climate change. The court said the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of evidence regarding support of the ordinance focused on local impacts and that ‚Äú[c]ourts have upheld other statutes more clearly motivated by extraterritorial concerns, as long as the regulatory effect did not control out-of-state transactions.‚Äù The court also found that the ordinance did not discriminate against interstate or foreign commerce on its face or in practical effect and that the operator had not shown that the primary purpose of the ordinance was to discriminate against such commerce. In making this finding, the court noted that while several members of the City Council had ‚Äúexpressed their desire to see reduced reliance on fossil fuels in the economy in general through more renewables,‚Äù they ‚Äúalso disclaimed an ability to accomplish that goal with an ordinance ‚Ä¶ and focused their comments on the developmental impacts within South Portland.‚Äù The court also found that the ordinance did not impose burdens on foreign or interstate commerce that were clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefit. Finally, the court found that the ordinance did not impermissibly interfere with the federal government's ability to speak with ‚Äúone voice‚Äù when regulating commerce with foreign governments.Arnold & Porter LLP.

Initiative's roots date back to 1970. The company is based in New York, NY, with additional offices worldwide. Mat Baxter is the company's Global CEO, and Amy Armstrong is US CEO.  History  One of the two main predecessors of Initiative, Western International Media, was founded in 1970 by Dennis Holt. It was one of the first agencies dedicated exclusively to media buying. In 1986, Western International Media won The Walt Disney Company account, a watershed moment in its history. It would keep the account until 2001. In 1994, the company was acquired by Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG). In 1998, IPG combined Western International Media of Los Angeles with IPG's European media buying network, Paris-based Initiative Media Worldwide. The new combined agency was called Western Initiative Media Worldwide. The NY Times reported at the time that the new entity would have 75 offices in 35 countries, and handled an estimated $10 billion in billings, making it the largest media buying agency in the world. The company's US business was managed out of Los Angeles, and the international operations were managed out of Paris. In February 2000, the company changed its name to Initiative Media. In July, Initiative Media acquired PIC TV, at the time the largest source of promotional TV advertising spots in the United States. In January 2017, IPG merged its third largest media buying network, Brand Programming Network (BPN), with Initiative Media, which was at the time IPG's second largest media buying network. In November, ecommerce company Amazon selected Initiative to manage global media planning and buying for Amazon's ecommerce hub, tech products and Amazon Prime subscription services. Also in November, Danish toy company The Lego Group selected Initiative as its global media agency. In April 2018, Amazon also awarded its Amazon Studios business to Initiative. In February 2019, Initiative was named as the media agency for gaming company Nintendo. Also in February, the agency was named trade publication AdWeek's Media Agency of the year. In April, trade publication Ad Age named Initiative its comeback agency of the year.  Global offices  Initiative is based in New York City, and holds additional offices in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. Clients  Initiative's media buying clients over the years have included Amazon, Walt Disney Company, The Lego Group and Nintendo. Cultural velocity The agency created the concept of \\"cultural velocity\\", a measure of cultural relevance that refers to the speed with which the agency's customers respond and react to cultural data, in order to remain relevant to consumers and improve sales.

Corey is a lawsuit appealed from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. The court heard the oral argument on September 26, 2018. Opinion In an opinion filed January 18, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), rejecting claims under the Commerce Clause that largely echoed unsuccessful arguments made before the Ninth Circuit in a previous appeal concerning only the 2011 and 2012 versions of the LCFS. The Ninth Circuit noted that although the LCFS had been repealed and replaced in 2015, the ‚Äúcore structure‚Äù of the regulations (with their emphasis on fuels‚Äô lifecycle emissions) and claims was the same as it had been when the court decided the first appeal. The Ninth Circuit therefore ruled that its prior decision on the 2011 and 2012 versions of the LCFS precluded the plaintiffs‚Äô claims that the 2015 LCFS constituted impermissible extraterritorial regulation and that it facially discriminated against interstate commerce in ethanol and crude oil. Regarding extraterritoriality, the court rejected the argument that the LCFS was motivated by a concern for environmental harms in other states, stating: ‚ÄúCalifornia did not enact the LCFS because it thinks that it is the state that knows how best to protect Iowa‚Äôs farms, Maine‚Äôs fisheries, or Michigan‚Äôs lakes.‚Äù The court said California's interest in lifecycle emissions arose from its concern about climate change's impacts on California and that the LCFS was therefore ‚Äúa classic exercise of police power.‚Äù Regarding facial discrimination, the court said that California was attempting ‚Äúto address a vitally important environmental issue with vast potential consequences‚Äù and that it could not offer ‚Äúa potential solution to the perverse incentives that would otherwise undermine any attempt to assess and regulate the carbon impact of different fuels ‚Ä¶ without the ability to differentiate the different production processes and power generation that are used to produce those fuels.‚Äù The Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs‚Äô ‚Äústructural federalism‚Äù claim was precluded by the court's recent decision on Oregon's Clean Fuel Program, in which the Ninth Circuit concluded that any such claim would be contingent on a finding that the program regulated extraterritorially. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that ‚Äú[t]here is simply no reason to search beyond the Commerce Clause for the Constitution‚Äôs limits on the ability of states to affect interstate commerce.‚Äù In addition, the Ninth Circuit found that the plaintiffs had failed to take advantage of the opportunity given by its earlier decision on the 2011 and 2012 LCFS to show that the LCFS was actually intended ‚Äúto prop up local fuel interests‚Äù and discriminate against interstate commerce. The court also dismissed claims against the 2011 and 2012 versions of the LCFS as moot because the challenged laws were no longer in effect and plaintiffs‚Äô obligations under the earlier versions had been discharged.Arnold & Porter LLP.

Selective Service System was a court case, decided in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on February 22, 2019, that declared that requiring men but not women to register for the draft for military service in the United States was unconstitutional. The ruling did not specify which actions the government must take to resolve the conflict with the constitution (e.g., whether to abolish the draft registration requirement or apply it in a gender-neutral manner). The ruling was appealed to the Fifth Circuit. Background In the United States, men between the ages of 18 and 25 and residing in the country, with limited exceptions, are required to sign up and maintain their registration in the Selective Service System, established by the Military Selective Service Act. Failure to register or maintain that can lead to fines and prison, and prevents one from several government benefits such as federally-backed student loans or employment in the federal sector. Women, who are not required to serve involuntarily, are not required to register. At the time it was established, the military did not allow women to serve in combat roles. The law was challenged on the basis of gender discrimination, leading to the Supreme Court case Rostker v. Goldberg. In that 1981 case, the Supreme Court ruled that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional on the basis that women were restricted from serving in combat roles. Oral Argument before the 9th Circuit in the appeal of the initial dismissal of the case. Between 2013 and 2015, the Pentagon abolished their restrictions on women voluntarily serving in combat roles. Based on these changes, the National Coalition for Men, a non-profit men's rights organization, filed a lawsuit against the Selective Service System in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on April 4, 2013, arguing that with the Pentagon's change in female participation in combat roles, the rationale behind Rostker no longer applied, and the male- only requirement of the Selective Service System was gender-discriminatory. In 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of the case and remanded the case back to the district court.National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service (2016) 19 February 2016. U.S. Court of Appeals, 9th Cir. The case was later moved to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in the 5th Circuit. In 2016, through a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, the Congress created the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service, an independent bipartisan advisory commission tasked with evaluating the Selective Service System and recommending whether women should be required to register with the Selective Service, or potentially do away with the Selective Service System to avoid the gender inequality issue. On January 23, 2019, the Commission released an interim report outlining the various options. On March 25, 2020, after holding various public hearings, the Commission issued its final report, recommending that as long as the Selective Service System exists, both men and women should be subject to mandatory draft registration. Arguments The National Coalition for Men argued in part: \\"Forcing only males to register is an aspect of socially institutionalized male disposability and helps reinforce the stereotypes that support discrimination against men in other areas such as child custody, divorce, criminal sentencing, paternity fraud, education, public benefits, domestic violence services, due process rights, genital autonomy, and more.\\"Women May Have to Register for the Draft as Men's Group Wins Selective Service Lawsuit Opponents of the status quo also argued that current conscription laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution via reverse incorporation because the law treats men and women differently. Ruling On February 22, 2019, Judge Gray H. Miller issued a declaratory judgement that the male-only registration requirement of the MSSA violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, since the restrictions on women serving in combat roles in the military, which were present at the time of the decision in Rostker, no longer applied and men and women are, therefore, similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft. Appeal The ruling was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Eagle Forum filed an amicus curiae brief supporting continued registration of men for the draft, opposing requiring women to register, and asking the Court of Appeals to overturn the District Court decision. A coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Texas, American Civil Liberties Union, 9to5 National Association of Working Women, A Better Balance, Gender Justice, KWH Law Center for Social Justice and Change, National Organization for Women Foundation, National Women‚Äôs Law Center, Women‚Äôs Law Center of Maryland, and Women‚Äôs Law Project filed an amicus curiae brief arguing that the Court of Appeals should uphold the District Court finding that the current Military Selective Service Act is unconstitutional. Oral arguments on the appeal were held March 3, 2020, before a 3-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals at Tulane Law School in New Orleans. A decision by the panel was issued on August 13, 2020, reversing the District Court judgment on the grounds that it amounted to overturning the Supreme Court's precedent, which only the Supreme Court has the authority to do.

Since, previous captured specimen of O. agassizi,that were found in the Mediterranean have been accredited to O. calypso, and is now believed to be the sole Opisthoteuthis species in the area. Life history Adult males are larger than females, with a total length of 482 mm and a weight of 5400 grams, while the females have a total length of 342 mm and a weight of 1650 g. Females of the Opisthoteuthis calypso have been shown to have ovarian oocyte size frequency which is akin to species that show continuous egg production and release, alluding to a continuous- spawning reproductive pattern. This contrasts with the semelparity shown in a majority of incirrate octopuses.Sartor, P., & Belcari, P. (2009).

Behavior The prey of Opisthoteuthis calypso includes small organisms with slow swim speeds. The most important prey items for Opisthoteuthis calypso include benthic gammarid, amphipods, and polychaetes of the epibenthic fauna (those which live on or just above the bottom sediments). In samples taken from the Sardinian Channel, Polychaeta and Crustacea made up around 40% and 36% of the total stomach contents respectively. Sand was also found in the stomachs of all samples which alludes to further evidence of their hunting behavior taking place in epibenthic zones. A detailed analysis feeding of relative species O. agassizi at 490 meters have shown a pattern of continuous feeding and is believed to be true for Opisthoteuthis calypso as well.Villanueva, R., & Guerra, A.

No bridge crossed the Wappoo Cut at the present location historically. A private company was chartered in 1896 and began raising funds. In 1898, when the idea of building a bridge was raised, phosphate companies, lumber companies, and towboat companies were aligned against the proposal for fear of its impact on their shipping businesses. A wooden bridge was added over the Wappoo Creek. That first bridge operated as a toll bridge until the privately-owned span was bought by the county in 1918. The county negotiated the price down to $8500 from $12,500, explaining that about $3500 of repairs were needed. The second bridge, opened in 1926, was a 434 foot span of concrete and metal. The earlier bridge had been rendered inadequate by the new developments on James Island including the Charleston County Club. When opened, the bridge was a swing bridge with a roadway 20 feet wide. The 1926 bridge was designed by James L. Parker and was built by the Sanitary and Drainage Commission of Charleston County with the Salmons-Clement Co. as the concrete contractor at a cost of $140,000. The 1926 swing bridge was, like the first bridge, inadequate for the increases in traffic. In 1949, funding (about $400,000) was secured for a larger bridge that would not have to been opened as frequently to permit small boats to pass. The replacement span was expected to be about 20 higher (30 feet versus 10.5 feet) than the swing span and was to be built 500 feet westward of the swing bridge to alleviate sharp turns on the approach. Surveying work for the draw bridge began in 1954. The current bridge was named to honor Burnet R. Maybank. The $900,000 bridge opened to traffic on June 12, 1956.

Best known for stained glass, her professional career encompassed roles as architect, muralist, mosaic artist, textile artist, inventor, writer, and studio boss. Tillinghast trained in Paris, then embarked on a commercial career in the decorative arts studios of 1880s New York City. Her early career was marked with successes despite a chaotic business relationship with John La Farge that ended in years of public litigation. Once independent, from the mid-1880s until her death in 1912, Tillinghast continued to produce major stained glass commissions while also running a stable, successful decorative arts business, working from a well- known studio in Greenwich Village.  Biography   Early life  Tillinghast was born in New York in 1845, the daughter of the wealthy merchant and land speculator Philip Tillinghast (1808-1879) and his wife Julia Anne Cozzens Titus. The family moved from Manhattan to Clinton Hill, Newark in the 1850s, where a street bears the family name. She was taught privately, and traveled with her father to Europe. From 1872 to 1878 she studied painting in Paris, under Carolus-Duran and others. Her father Philip was ruined in the financial panic of 1873, and died in 1879. While the family retained some means and its social connections, Mary made a vocation for herself out of her art training. Within a few years, from 1878 to 1884, she got direct experience in the flourishing decorative arts studios of the time, in both the Tiffany camp and La Farge camp.  Tiffany and La Farge  Urania, Allegheny Observatory, 1903 In February 1881 Tillinghast became an employee of pioneering interior designer Candace Wheeler, at that time of Tiffany & Wheeler. For all of Wheeler's professional support of other women, the job lasted only until mid-July, then within months she and Tillinghast had a legal dispute in 1881-82 over a patented tapestry stitch. Wheeler considered Tillinghast's patent application for a \\"Needle-Woven Tapestry\\" stolen from her studios, and filed suit. Ultimately the two patent applications were found to be non-conflicting, and the suit dismissed. Tillinghast's patent was granted November 8, 1882. (Her address was given as West Orange, New Jersey.) By that time, Tillinghast had already left Wheeler's employment, gone to work for John La Farge, become head of his embroidery department, and went to work within his legendary decorative arts and stained glass design studios. From La Farge she learned the art of designing and making windows, along with the benefit of access to his craftsmen. During her tenure the firm landed part of the plum commission for The Union League Club in 1881. In October 1882 she embarked with him as equal partners in a business entity called \\"John La Farge and Tillinghast\\", an attempt to deliver years of backlog, re-order the firm's finances, and preserve its client list. This lasted a year, with little success. Its successor was the La Farge Decorative Art Company, recapitalized and headed by George A. Chamberlain, the man who became La Farge's virtual nemesis in the ensuing years of litigation over the company's artistic assets. La Farge was charged with larceny for refusing to hand over his own work, an unfortunate turn in his career. Tillinghast remained involved and became a third party in these suits, both La Farge and Chamberlain unhappy with her. In 1883 she produced a professional coup, a commission for heavy French-blue tapestries hung as curtains in the library of the Cornelius Vanderbilt II House on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street‚Äîfabricated with a new process, attributed to her alone. Vanderbilt's well-publicized, often-mentioned fee to Tillinghast for those tapestries was $30,000. In contrast La Farge had been fired by the Vanderbilts and blacklisted among their social circle.  Independence  In the following years Tillinghast relocated to Washington for a year or so, executing a number of house renovations for clients including Alexander Graham Bell. She returned to Europe for further training, again with Carolus-Duran and with Jean-Jacques Henner. Once resettled back in New York City's Greenwich Village, near her family's original home, she would work from her well-known, famously unheated studios at No. 3 Washington Square North for the rest of her life. One regular patroness for stained glass artwork and other projects was the moneyed philanthropist Mrs. Russell Sage. Tillinghast's artwork took a large variety of forms, spanning textiles, oil portraits, interior design, and at least one complete mausoleum. Her business model continued to evolve as well, into a number of directions: home decoration, with a series of advice articles for Art Interchange magazine; the creation of \\"Tillinghast Studios\\" with an evident sideline in church furnishings; and an expanded architectural practice. Even in the narrow field of stained glass, according to her obituary in the American Art Directory, \\"Miss Tillinghast was the first to realize the difference that the electric lighting of churches was destined to make in the spectacular effect of window designs.\\" Mary Tillinghast was an architect and a member of the National Sculpture Society. Never married, she died at home in New York in late 1912. She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. In 1913, painter Edward Hopper and his wife, Josephine, moved into the studio on the unheated top floor of No. 3 Washington Square North and lived there until May 1967.Levin Gail (1998) Hopper's Places University of California Press.

Neighboring communities include Willtown Bluff, Jericho, Osborne, and Adams Run. Parker‚Äôs Ferry falls within Adams Run's zip code, 29426. The elevation of Parkers Ferry is 20 feet, and it is in the Eastern Time Zone. Penny Creek is the primary water source of this community.  Battle of Parker‚Äôs Ferry  An American Revolutionary War skirmish, the Battle of Parker's Ferry, in which the Patriot forces were led by Brigadier General Francis Marion, occurred near Parkers Ferry on August 30 or 31, 1781.  Historic plantations  Parker Ferrys is home to three historic plantations ‚Äì Battlefield Plantation, Barings Plantation, and Encampment Plantation.  Barings Plantation  Barings Plantation was originally owned by Thomas Middleton. It was later named after Charles Baring II, who purchased the plot of land from Middleton in 1831. Barings Plantain was home to over 140 slaves in 1850. The primary crop was rice. According to the 1850 Agriculture Census, Barings Plantation produced 570,000 pounds of rice, 2,000 bushels of corn, 2,000 bushels of peas, and 1,600 bushels of sweet potatoes. The livestock on the plantation included 30 milk cows, 15 horses, 16 oxen, 150 sheep, and 300 other cattle. After a series of purchases between different owners, the Barings Plantation was later renamed the Sandy Point Plantation in 1995. Owners frequently found prehistoric fossils, such as Megalodon teeth, and artifacts from Civil War, Revolutionary War and pre‚ÄìRevolutionary war times, including Indian spearheads, pipes, and pottery.  Encampment Plantation  Encampment Plantation was owned by Robert Young Hayne, senator and governor of South Carolina. It is speculated that the property may have been the location where troops were stationed during the Revolutionary War to guard South Carolina's state government, which met across the Edisto River during the British occupation of Charleston. The primary crop was rice. The plantation is estimated 794 acres in size.  Churches  Greater St. Mark AME Greater St. Mark AME Church, Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, and Greater New Bethlehem AME Church are three major churches in the Parker‚Äôs Ferry community.

It is high in alcoholic content and has been called the \\"Long Island Iced Tea of exotic drinks.\\" It has historically been served in special Fog Cutter ceramic mugs. Such as is the case with many tiki drinks, there are also claims that the cocktail was invented at a different restaurant, including Edna Fogcutter's and Don Beach's. History Jeffy Berry calls the Fog Cutter Trader Vic's second most historically popular cocktail, unusual for a tiki drink because of the cream sherry that is floated on top. The recipe for the drink is the same in both Bergeron's original 1947 Bartender's Guide and his revised version from 1972. The revised version carries a quote describing the cocktail: \\"Fog Cutter, hell. After two of these, you won't even see the stuff\\". The recipe also has a mark next to it, indicating that he claimed to have invented the drink. Despite this, there is no broad agreement as to who invented the cocktail, but similar to the Mai Tai he is the person most associated with it and receives credit for the Fog Cutter's broad popularization. An official Trader Vic's drink menu postcard from the 1940s lists a Fog Cutter and reads \\"What a sneaker - positively only two to a person; really, I don't see why people buy them.\\" Variations Bergeron revised the drink in the 1950s to make it less potent, calling it the Samoan Fog Cutter. It is essentially the same recipe but has 1 oz less of liquor, cutting back on the amount of rum and brandy while still retaining its character as a predominantly rum based drink. It was also blended instead of shaken. A Viking Fog Cutter from a Nordic restaurant floated aquavit instead of the cream sherry. A still different version from the Bali Hai at The Beach in New Orleans spelled their Fogg Cutter with an extra \\"g\\". It was a similar drink to Vic's original but added dark Jamaican rum and swapped lemon for the lime juice; most importantly, it dropped the use of the sherry float. Some modern day Tiki drink experts don't care for Vic's original version, calling it only \\"just fine\\" or saying that later versions were \\"much improved\\". Others believe Vic's represents the best version. Eponymous mug The Fog Cutter is the only drink in Trader Vic's 1947 Bartender's Guide that carried an illustration for a ceramic mug with a Polynesian motif, making it one of the first ceramic tiki mugs (as the term is used generically; the book also carried an illustration for a ceramic mug in the shape of a skull and large ceramic drinking bowls). As drawn in his Bartender's Guide the mug is shown as being a depiction of a Hula girl. Actual versions appeared slightly different but with the same subject matter. A later version of the mug, often attributed to Vic's Samoan Fog Cutter version, depicts a relaxing man being serenaded by a wahine with a ukulele under a bright sun. A common drink on the menu of most tiki bars, over 50 variations of a mug meant to specifically hold a Fog Cutter cocktail are known to exist, many in radically different designs than the one used by Trader Vic's. In popular culture Martin Cate, the owner of the Forbidden Island restaurant and tiki bar has a vanity license plate which reads \\"FGCUTTR\\".

Records in 2019. The members of the band had all previously played with The Beasts of Bourbon, with the change of name due to the death of Spencer P. Jones and Brian Hooper. Details The inspiration for the album was the death of Brian Hooper, who had been the long-term bassist of The Beasts of Bourbon, in April 2018. After his funeral, other former members arranged a recording session. The original idea was to get all former members together, but James Baker was unable to attend due to health issues. Founding member Spencer P. Jones was only able to contribute one song before his own death in August. The album continued with a change of band name to The Beasts. Kim Salmon said, \\"With respect, this isn‚Äôt the Beasts of Bourbon. It would need to have Jonesy on every track to be that! But loudly and proudly this is: The Beasts Still Here.\\" Jones was the first person to contribute a song to the project, \\"At the Hospital\\". Perkins said, \\"He was totally into it, but he was very ill at the time. He was very sick and it took a lot out of him to do that. We were lucky to get one song out of Jonesy: he just came to the studio and we set him up a comfy chair and basically just said, 'Play whatever you like whenever you like.' Every member of the band besides drummer Pola contributed to the song-writing. Covers were recorded of songs by former members Hooper and Jones. Jones' song, \\"Drunk on a Train\\", had previously been recorded by his band The Painkillers. Salmon's \\"Pearls Before Swine\\" had been offered to the band for their previous album (when he wasn't a member), but was declined. Salmon said, \\"I‚Äôm so happy about that because I always thought it was a theme song for the band and that was my intention to write one, even though I‚Äôd left. To do a song like that you can‚Äôt just approach it as a boast, you have to be a bit self-deprecating.\\" (l-r)Owen, Perkins, Sujdovic, Salmon Sujdovic said of the recording process, \\"we didn‚Äôt rehearse them before we went in, and we didn‚Äôt do too much to them, we just learnt the songs when we were in the studio, and as we were learning them we recorded them. So we recorded them pretty much live.\\" Two covers were recorded from outside the band. Frank Zappa's \\"The Torture Never Stops\\" and Warren Zevon's \\"My Shit's Fucked Up\\", both suggested by Perkins. Owen said, \\"I worked on \\"My Shit's Fucked Up\\".

The violence led to the destruction of several dozen brothels, and to as many as 15 deaths. Accounts and analyses of the event differ with regard to its goals and participants (varying as to the participation of Jewish Bund labor-party militants, Jewish workers, Christian workers, and criminals; as well as to the genesis of the event and the exact numbers of casualties). Background Cossacks holding their rifles up, photographed on Senatorska street near the Blue Palace, Warsaw, during one of the riots in 1905Niezwyk≈Çe ujƒôcia znajomych miejsc, Gazeta Wyborcza website In the second half of the 19th century, prostitution, sex trafficking, and sexual slavery became widespread in Warsaw. These activities were mostly dominated by the Jewish underworld, and their existence caused much tension and controversy within Warsaw's Polish-Jewish community. While in Congress Poland and Warsaw, overall, 72.7% prostitutes were Catholic and 21.36% were Jewish, in Warsaw the proportion of Jewish prostitutes was much higher. In 1874 two-thirds of all registered prostitutes in Warsaw were Jewish.Antony Polonsky, The Jews in Poland and Russia, Volume 2: 1881 to 1914, The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2010, p. 93 In 1889 around 75% of all brothels in Warsaw were run by Jews.Studia Judaica 18 (2015), issue 2 (36), pp. 339‚Äì357: Aleksandra Jakubczak, ‚ÄûPogrom alfons√≥w‚Äù w Warszawie 1905 roku w ≈õwietle prasy ≈ºydowskiej (\\"1905 pogrom of pimps in Warsaw in the light of the Jewish press\\"). Accounts differ as to the cause of the violence. Some consider this a political action by Jewish workers. As violent riots escalated during the unrest in the mid-1900s, tensions between the Jewish underworld and workers grew to the point where a violent wide-scale incident was increasingly likely. According to Laura Engelstein, the pimps were perceived by Bundists to be agents of the Okhrana (Russian Tsarist police). The Keys to Happiness: Sex and the Search for Modernity in Fin-de-si√®cle Russia, Laura Engelstein, Cornell University Press, page 309 The riot The pogrom started following a rumor, though it is not clear which rumor actually sparked the pogrom. One version suggests that a sister or fianc√©e of a Bund activist was kidnapped and taken to a brothel, and he was wounded trying to rescue her. Another says a Jewish prostitute asked a Jewish worker for help in her plight, and when he tried to rescue her, he was killed. All versions suggest that after the rescuer was injured or killed, his friends started a large-scale riot. Jewish activists associated with the Bund labor party were involved in the rioting. Another version is that the reason for the riot was criminal interference in the competition between legal and illegal brothels. Antony Polonsky rejects the view that this was a political action organized by the Bund as \\"a reaction of Jewish workers to the exploitation of Jewish women.\\" Polonsky writes that the criminal underworld was substantially involved, and he notes that \\"only licensed brothels were affected\\".Antony Polonsky, The Jews in Poland and Russia, volume 2: 1881 to 1914, The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2010, p. 93. Although accounts of events differ, most agree that bands of Jewish workers went from brothel to brothel, assaulting pimps and prostitutes, destroying and looting property. Clashes also spread into the city streets. The rioting started in northwest Warsaw before spreading throughout the city. According to some scholars (for instance Borzymi≈Ñska and Jakubczak) the rioting was joined on the second day by Christian workers, and the third day saw criminals take advantage of the chaos to commit robberies. Jewish workers acted only in the Jewish neighborhood, striking just the Jewish parts of the underworld. Christian workers did corresponding with the Christian gangsters. Tsarist police authorities allegedly attempted to orchestrate an anti-Jewish pogrom (such accusations are part of the Bund narrative of the events), but when the attempt failed, the Russian governor, ordered the military to suppress the riot. The riot is considered to have been put down by 26 May 1905, though lesser incidents continued for a few more days, with 3 further fatalities on 28 May. Aftermath During the disturbances 150 dwellings (including 40 brothels) were destroyed, with property damage estimated at 200,000 rubles, 5 people were killed, 10 severely injured (most died later in hospitals) and over 40 injured. According to Scott Ury, 5 persons were killed in the events themselves, another 10 died from wounds they incurred, and over 40 were hospitalized. According to a Reuter report, the number of injured was 100.Edward J. Bristow, Prostitution and Prejudice: The Jewish Fight Against White Slavery 1870‚Äì1939, Clarendon Press, 1982, p. 61 Police arrested close to 100 pimps and prostitutes. The Bund leadership at first criticized its activists who took part in the rioting, but later changed its stance and claimed the riot was a righteous action against the morally corrupt government and criminals. The riot brought the problem of prostitution in Poland to wider public attention and led to attempts to address the problem through further debate and reforms. wrote a poem, \\"Po pogromie\\" (\\"After the Pogrom\\"), about the incident.

Angola is approaching middle income status with a GDP per capita of about $4,100. Angola has the second largest oil reserves in Africa; its oil industry is highly modern and sophisticated. Sonangol, the national oil company, is the dominant player in the oil industry. Some argue that Sonangol funds the one-party state's political machine. Outside of the oil industry, the Angolan economy, particularly the private sector and financial system, is largely undeveloped and uncompetitive. Some political scientists have characterized Angola as a \\"successful failed state\\" given the country's high levels of oil wealth and low levels of human development and public service delivery.  Political economic history  post-1945 (end of WWII): economic growth from agricultural exports, primarily coffee production. During the 1950s and 1960s, Angola was the fourth largest exporter of coffee in the world; Angola was also one of the largest producers of foodstuffs in sub-Saharan Africa. 1955: oil discovered. However, oil did not surpass coffee in terms of export revenue until 1973. 1960 to 1975: public investment in infrastructure and liberalization of investment laws in 1965. Economic development was led by Portuguese settlers in Angola; settlers were the main beneficiaries of economic growth. Before independence, Angola was a mainly market-driven economy. Private consumption was 70% of GDP, while total government consumption was less than 20% of GDP. Private consumption was mostly driven by Portuguese settlers, while most Angolans worked in the contract labor and plantation systems. During the same period of colonial economic expansion, Portugal was also fighting a war to retain Angola as its colony. Portugal's economy was in decline during this period, so many Portuguese emigrated to Angola for better economic opportunities. 1975: Angola gains independence from the Portuguese. 300,000 Portuguese settlers left Angola following independence. Given that Portuguese settlers ran the colonial economy and its bureaucracy, had most of the human capital in the country, and controlled most of the country's physical capital, emigration severely damaged the Angolan economy. Agostinho Neto, who was Angola's first President from 1975-1979, changed Angola's economic structure from a market-led economy to a Marxist, command economy. Neto instituted a new pricing system, that included price ceilings and subsidized low prices for agricultural goods. The post-independence period was marked by economically unproductive policies that led to price distortions, scarcities of basic consumer goods, and a decline in industrial production. Neto also seized Portuguese-held property and nationalized companies owned by Portuguese settlers. 1975-2002: A combination of ethnic tensions and disagreements between the three main nationalist groups, the MPLA, FLNA, and UNITA, led to a civil war immediately following Angola's independence from Portugal. The war led to a collapse of the rural economy. Three million refugees left the countryside and moved to cities in search of work. The war also destroyed infrastructure in the country. For example, the interior was cut off from coastal urban centers after transportation networks were disrupted and/or destroyed. However, the oil industry remained intact through civil war because oil extraction was the primary means for the MPLA to collect revenue; oil revenue also maintained the MPLA's one-party monopoly over political power. 1979-2017: Eduardo dos Santos and the MPLA consolidated control over the oil economy through Sonangol and instituted a one-party state.  Petroleum and the private sector  Oil is central to the Angolan economy. Oil and related industry constitute 50% of Angola's GDP and 92% of its exports. Angola has attracted an unprecedented amount of foreign direct investment. Between 2003 and 2008, between $17 and $23 billion dollars were invested in the Angolan oil industry. Multinational oil companies with operations in Angola include ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, CNOOC, and Sinopec. Sonangol, Angola's national oil company, is an important domestic institution in the country. Sonangol is highly professionalized and competitive; it is the main engine behind the oil economy. The economy is subject to the vagaries of oil prices. Political stability depends in part on consistent oil revenues to fund government projects and the MPLA's security apparatus. When prices fall, as they did in 2014, the government was hard-pressed for cash and was forced to cut fuel subsidies, which led to protests and instability. Since 2004, Angola has relied on China to secure external financing for projects and to insulate itself from the booms and busts of commodity prices. China has extended $20 billion worth of credit to the Angolan government. In addition to international oil companies, China is a key part of Angola's political economy.  An underdeveloped private sector  Angola is a one-party state led by the MPLA. According to a World Bank study, the work of building an independent, price-competitive, market-led private sector, and the institutions necessary to sustain and regulate markets, remains secondary to the political, economic, and financial interests of elites. Current impediments to a robust private sector include: # The financial and banking systems remain underdeveloped. Angola does not have a stock market. This means that oil wealth cannot be maximized long-term. For example, oil windfalls cannot be converted into financial assets that can produce higher yields over time. # The costs of capital remain high and often prohibit smaller businesses from acquiring loans. Most banks serve large, commercial clients; few are focused on small and medium enterprises. # Angola has one of the worst business and investment climates in the world. Angola ranks 175 of 190 on the World Bank's \\"Ease of Doing Business\\" report. Acquiring permits and licenses for business in Angola is one of the most difficult and lengthy processes. Angola is 182 out of 190 countries in licensing and permitting for domestic business.  Sonangol   A brief history  In the 1970s, the MPLA put together a commission of businessmen, lawyers, engineers, and other experts to establish Sonangol. Sonangol was an outgrowth of ANGOL, a subsidiary of the Portuguese oil company, SACOR. Sonangol was an exception to Neto's socialist ideology of nationalization and expropriation of foreign property and assets. Sonangol attracted highly competent and experienced consultants, engineers, and other personnel from the international oil industry, including from the US, despite the fact that the US government was hostile to Angola and the leftist MPLA during the Cold War. Sonangol is an example of what political scientist Ricardo Soares de Oliveira calls, \\"realeconomik,\\" in which the MPLA made a calculated decision to create an \\"enclave economy\\" to finance Neto's socialist ideology; revenue from Sonangol also funded war efforts against the South African apartheid regime and the US- backed UNITA insurgency following Angola's independence.  Sonangol's business  Sonangol collects over 90% of the government's revenues and employs 5,000 people. In 1991, Sonangol expanded its ambitions and restructured as a holding company, with multiple subsidiaries operating in oil services, such as training, air and maritime transportation, telecommunication, and insurance. The process of \\"Angolanisation,\\" as it is called by the MPLA, has extended into joint ventures with foreign oil companies. Sonangol has also served as an important source of investment in housing, educational scholarships, and sports teams in Angola, many of which cater to the upper echelons of Angolan society. Sonangol is considered to have the most negotiating leverage with foreign partners compared to its counterparts in the Gulf of Guinea. Sonangol has considerable respect within the international oil community, in part because of its marketing campaigns and global presence.  Sonangol's political relevance  Some, including political scientist Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, have argued that Sonangol is a main vehicle for former President Dos Santos and his Futungo, or close circle of businessmen and family members, to advance their economic and political interests. During the Dos Santos presidency, the president's son, Jose Filomeno Dos Santos, was appointed to manage Angola's sovereign wealth fund. In 2018, current president Joao Lourenco removed him from this post, and Dos Santos is now accused of transferring $500 million out of an account at the Angolan Central Bank. The former president's daughter, Isabel Dos Santos, the richest woman in Africa, was appointed to Sonangol during her father's presidency. She too has been removed and a $38 million transfer Dos Santos made before her removal from Sonangol is currently being investigated by Anti- Corruption Prevention and Control, a government agency under the Lourenco administration. Some have questioned whether Sonangol has been sufficiently transparent in its accounting. For example, the IMF reported, between 2007 and 2010, $32 billion worth of oil revenues disappeared from the company's books. Sonangol has routinely failed to publish annual financial reports. Yet the IMF has also been criticized for its continued loans to the Angolan regime despite the government's failure to comply with IMF conditions, which include financial disclosure, proper auditing procedures, and lawful management, transfer, and deposits of oil rents.  Sonangol's effect on the Angolan economy  Soares de Oliveira has also argued that Sonangol has crowded out and undermined the Angolan financial system, through its \\"parallel\\" sources of financing. Syndicated oil-backed loans, that is loans that are paid in oil (as opposed to currency), and backed by multiple banks, are issued by Sonangol when the MPLA is in need of cash. This \\"parallel state,\\" specifically its financial engine, allows elites to bypass formal, more aboveboard methods of financing. The capacity and sophistication of Sonangol's financing and debt servicing far exceed the capabilities of other state financial institutions, such as the Angolan Finance Ministry and the central bank. The centrality of Sonangol and Angola's oil sector has resulted in an otherwise uncompetitive and undeveloped economy. Soares discusses this strategy of monopoly and tight control as inherently political‚Äîto maintain and solidify the interests of elites at the expense of the development of the Angolan economy. Sonangol retains leverage and insulation from substantive criticism in the international community that would prompt lasting reform in part because the Angolan oil market is so large. Foreign oil companies are thus hesitant to cause trouble with Sonangol.  The 'successful failed state'  Political scientist Philippe le Billon describes the oil industry in Angola as an \\"enclave economy\\" and an \\"economic sanctuary\\" for the MPLA to maintain and consolidate its political power. Despite oil and diamond wealth, Angola ranks 147th out of 189 on the UN's Human Development Index; public services remain poor, social expenditure is minimal, and public health indicators are low. Two thirds of the population live on less than $2 a day. Infant mortality rates are high‚Äîone in four children die before the age of five‚Äîand rural poverty rates are 58.3% while urban poverty rates are 18.7%. The MPLA is a consistent presence at the national, regional and local levels. Anthropologists have observed high levels of \\"voicelessness\\" and \\"powerlessness\\" within urban and rural communities in Angola; formalized political representation within institutions of the state remain low, and most Angolans rely on informal institutions such as social networks for support in times of need.

Drifting westwards, the oil covered 850 km of Nigerian coastline, contaminating waters and negatively impacting fishing in the region. Only 1% of the spill reached the shore, largely due to favorable weather conditions as well as Mobil's response to the situation. In 2016, a Federal High Court in Lagos, Nigeria ruled against Mobil for US $32 million in damages.  Effects  On 12 January 1998, a 24-inch pipeline on Mobil's Idoho platform burst, spilling 40,000 barrels of Qua Iboe light crude oil into the Niger River Delta. The oil covered sections of Nigeria and the Republic of Benin's coastline, and drifted westwards, extending as far as 900 km away in Lagos Harbor. In total, 500 barrels (21,000 gallons) of oil washed ashore. Affected shoreline areas suffered medium to heavy impact, but were limited to only a small number of locations around the coast, including two mangrove environments. Despite the relatively small amount of oil washed ashore, the spill had a heavy impact on fishing communities and cooperatives in the region, leading to many being unable to fish as well as others losing occupational tools such as nets due to oil damage.  Cleanup Effort  Mobil responded with a range of equipment to clean the spill, including boats, skimmers, and coastal protection equipment. Warm weather and favorable tides also made it so that much of the oil stayed off the coastline and evaporated, and this was aided by the use of dispersants through helicopters and boats. This led to 60% of the spilled oil naturally dispersing. Containment boons and oil skimmers were also used to control the remaining spilled oil. On land, beaches underwent self-cleaning via natural processes within 2‚Äì4 weeks. Later, Mobil began cleanup operations led by trained supervisors in affected villages, and invited experts from Lagos University and the United States to assist in the cleanup process. However, Human Rights Watch reports indicate shoreline cleanup had not begun by 28 January, more than two weeks after the spill had occurred, and even by March some affected sites remained contaminated. Cleanup efforts in heavily affected shoreline areas ultimately yielded approximately 1000 barrels of oily waste, amounting to 100 barrels of actual oil. Although short-term environmental impact studies were conducted by Mobil, long-term studies as originally promised were never published on the impacts of the spill.  Response  The spill prompted widespread backlash from local residents and groups, particularly those located at the estuary of the Pennington River, who were the hardest hit. In total, approximately 14,000 claims for reparations were made, totalling over US $100 million. Fishermen and locals in nearby Eket protested, going as far as to hold employees of Mobil hostage in order to demand compensation. Protests were particularly abundant amongst fishermen, many of whom were left with nets that were clogged with oil and unusable, which Mobil then burned after inspections to prevent them from being reused. On January 19 and 20, a near-riot broke out in a protest led by local youth in order to have Mobil Nigeria establish a claims office in Eket. Protestors numbered in the thousands and negotiations took over nine hours, but meetings between demonstration leaders and Mobil representatives proved fruitful and a claims office was subsequently established. The protest against Mobil Nigeria, however, led to the arrests of up to 300 protestors. In July 1998, eleven men were shot and killed by police during protests for reparations in Warri, Delta State. On 1 May 2010, another spill occurred in a Mobil (now ExxonMobil) pipeline in Akwa Ibom State, this time spilling over a million gallons of oil and taking seven days to stop. Reports indicate that the pipelines carrying the crude to Qua Iboe Terminal are \\"dilapidated and decrepit\\" and are in need of replacement. On 16 December 2016, a Federal High Court in Lagos, Nigeria ordered Mobil Nigeria to pay US $32 million in damages to the fishermen affected by the spill, citing a violation of their right to life and right to live in an environment favorable to their socioeconomic development.

Even the COMELEC reversed the petition, the COMELEC proclaimed that Arthur Robes will be the winner of the 2013 elections, since he had 63.16% (74,302) votes than Papin's 31.90% (37,526) votes. Robes was a candidate of the Liberal Party at this time. His husband, Rida, failed to win the mayor seat, while being the party's standard bearer at the same time.  2016 elections  The party was successful in the elections because their standard bearer, Rida Robes won a congressional seat in its lone district, and their leader, Arthur Robes and his running mate, Efren Bartolome Jr, won their seats as mayor and vice-mayor, respectively.

It was held in Madrid, Spain, from 2 to 13 December 2019 under the presidency of the Chilean government. The conference incorporated the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 15th meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP15), and the second meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA2). Prelude The conference was planned to be held in Brazil in November 2019, but a year before the planned start, newly-elected President Jair Bolsonaro withdrew the offer to host the event, citing economic reasons. Then Chile stepped up and became the new host, but social unrest in the lead-up to the meeting forced it late October 2019 to withdraw from hosting. Then by mutual agreement between the UN, Chile, and Spain, the latter became the new host. Various climate activists had set out from Europe to South America by sailboat, before the decision had been taken to relocate COP25 to Madrid. In mid-November, some of these activists joined an alternative conference, the \\"Forest COP\\", near the centre of the Amazon jungle, in Terra do Meio. The event was attended by indigenous leaders, scientists and academics such as Eduardo G√≥es Neves, and activists such as Nadezhda Tolokonnikova. After the Forest COP, a follow-on event, \\"Amaz√¥nia Centro do Mundo\\" (Amazon: The Centre of the World) took place on 17 November in nearby Altamira. Event planning In November, Teresa Ribera, the Spanish Minister for the Ecological Transition, announced the conference would be held at the IFEMA facilities in Madrid. The Spanish government divided the COP25 into two zones, one blue and one green. The blue zone hosted sessions for negotiation between the parties of the COP. This included the 15th session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and the 2nd session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. The blue zone also hosted events and activities run by NGO actors and side events organized by states other than Spain. The green zone was dedicated to civil society initiatives aiming to promote social participation. This area was divided into three thematic sub-zones: one involving youth events, the second designated to indigenous peoples, and the third focused on science and innovation. The green zone was intended to be an open-dialogue pavilion for all types of civil actors, ranging from NGOs to businesses, academia and sponsors. Participants Harjeet Singh, of environmental group ActionAid International, said that moving the summit from Chile to Spain with only four weeks' notice presented \\"real barriers to participation\\" for delegates from the southern hemisphere. In August 2019, youth climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father Svante sailed from Plymouth, England across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas in sailboat Malizia II to participate in the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City in September. At that time it was not clear how she was going to return to Europe, but she was planning to go on to Chile for the conference. With the move of the conference to Madrid, the need to return to Europe became more urgent. Teresa Ribera, as Spain's environment minister, offered her help in finding a way to travel to the conference. Riley Whitelum and his wife, Elayna Carausu, two Australians who had been sailing around the world aboard their catamaran, La Vagabonde, took Thunberg back across the Atlantic. On 13 November 2019, Thunberg set sail from Hampton, Virginia for Lisbon, Portugal. Her departing message was the same as it has been since she began her activism: \\"My message to the Americans is the same as to everyone ‚Äì that is to unite behind the science and to act on the science.\\" Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi led a 15-member Congressional delegation to the talks to demonstrate continued U.S. support for the negotiations, despite the Trump administration's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement. Ecuadorian environmental activist Helena Gualinga participated. She spoke about her concern on the Ecuadorian government authorizing oil extraction in indigenous land. She said: \\"Our country's government is still granting our territories to the corporations responsible of climate change. This is criminal.\\" She criticized the Ecuadorian government for claiming interest in protecting the Amazon during the conference instead of attending indigenous Amazon women's demands brought to the government during the 2019 Ecuadorian protests. She also expressed her disappointment towards world leaders' lack of interest to discuss topics brought by indigenous peoples to the conference.  Negotiations  Mapuche people protesting against REDD+, Climate March in Madrid, Friday 6 December 2019 The last part of the Paris regime that remains to be resolved is Article 6, which describes rules for a carbon market and other forms of international cooperation. In the COP24 conference no agreement could be reached on this topic. Several politically difficult decisions have to be made for this article. Negative emissions could be traded under the Kyoto Protocol to offset emissions by developed countries, but many of these negative emission projects would have happened anyway without the extra incentive from the Kyoto Protocol, so that this mechanism was described as 'hot air'. International trading of carbon can make overall emission cuts cheaper. If negotiations about this fail, it will come up again in 2020's COP26 (postponed to 2021). According to scientists, talks focused on some of the rules for implementing the 2015 Paris agreement, but the overriding issue of how fast the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions has received little official attention. Urgent UN talks on tackling the climate emergency are still not addressing the true scale of the crisis, one of the world‚Äôs leading climate scientists has warned.UN climate talks failing to address urgency of crisis, says top scientist The Guardian, 2019-12-08 Negotiations concluded on 15 December 2019, two days after the stated deadline. News News during the conference included: * Greenland's ice sheet melting seven times faster than in 1990s.Greenland's ice sheet melting seven times faster than in 1990s The Guardian, 2019-12-10 * Oxygen in the oceans is decreasing.Oceans losing oxygen at unprecedented rate, experts warn The Guardian, 2019-12-07 * A quarter of the world‚Äôs population are at risk of water supply problems as mountain glaciers, snow-packs and alpine lakes are run down by global heating and rising demand.1.9 billion people at risk from mountain water shortages The Guardian, 2019-12-09  Results  The results of the conference were disappointing at a time when climate action and concrete measures are considered urgent. Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists who has attended climate negotiations since 1991, stated that he had never seen before the almost total disconnect between what the science requires and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action. Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan summarized the prevalent opinion: ‚ÄúClimate blockers like Brazil and Saudi Arabia, enabled by an irresponsibly weak Chilean leadership, peddled carbon deals and steamrolled scientists and civil society‚Äù. The decisions about the carbon market and emissions cuts were delayed to the next climate conference in Glasgow. The United States, Russia, India, China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia were the main opponents of these measures. On the other side, the European Union reached an agreement about \\"The European Green New Deal\\" that should lower its emissions to zero by 2050. Also, many commitments were made by countries, cities, businesses and international coalitions. For example, the Climate Ambitious Coalition contains now \\"73 countries committed to net zero emissions by 2050, as well as a further actors (regions, cities, businesses, investors) who have pledged the same goal\\". All the information about the pledges (governmental and non-governmental) is streamed to the Global Climate Action portal.

Sponsors for the UN's COP26 climate talks in Glasgow will also need to have strong climate credentials. The venue is the SEC Centre in Central Glasgow. Originally due to be held in November 2020 at the same venue, the event was postponed for twelve months in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Presidency Former UK Minister for Energy and Clean Growth, Claire Perry O'Neill, was originally appointed President of COP26, but the UK government abruptly removed her on 31 January 2020, stating that the post would become \\"a ministerial role\\". Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Foreign Secretary William Hague were unwilling to accept the position. On 13 February, Conservative minister Alok Sharma was appointed to the role. Nigel Topping was appointed as the UK government's High Level Climate Action Champion for COP26; he is the former CEO of We Mean Business, a climate change action organisation. Also appointed by the Prime Minister and taking a finance advisory position is Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England. Partnering the UK in leading COP26 will be Italy. For the most part, their role will be in preparatory work such as the hosting of a pre-COP session and an event for young people called Youth4Climate 2020: Driving Ambition. These events were scheduled to take place between 28 September and 2 October 2020 in Milan.  Global Stocktake  Under the Paris Agreement, countries submitted Intended nationally determined contributions, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to a \\"business as usual\\" scenario. Under the framework of the Paris Agreement, each country was expected to submit enhanced nationally determined contributions every five years, to ratchet up ambition to mitigate climate change. Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, the conference of 2020 was set to be the first global stocktake. Postponement In light of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the Conference of Parties was postponed until 1st-12th November, 2021.https://sdg.iisd.org/events/2020-un-climate-change-conference-unfccc- cop-26/ Host nations Italy and the United Kingdom were heavily affected by the pandemic, and the venue of the conference, the SEC Centre in Glasgow, was converted in May 2020 into a temporary hospital for COVID-19 patients. UNFCCC Secretary Patricia Espinosa tweeted that \\"in light of the ongoing, worldwide effects of COVID-19, holding an ambitious, inclusive, COP26 in November 2020 is not possible.\\" She also indicated that when economies restart, this will be an opportunity to \\"shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, just, safe and more resilient.\\" The rearranged date was announced in May 2020. Earlier in 2021, the UK and Italy are due to host summits of the G7 and G20 respectively. Independent observers noted that though not directly related, the postponement will give the international community time to respond to the outcome of the United States presidential election. This is crucial because incumbent president Donald Trump has pledged to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement; while his Democratic challengers have pledged to immediately rejoin the Paris Agreement and increase ambition to reduce emissions.

The genus is native to eastern China, Eastern Asia and the Russian Far East, although species have been introduced to Europe and North America. Members of the genus, including R. japonica (Japanese knotweed) and its hybrid with R. sachalinensis, are highly invasive plants. Description Species placed in the genus Reynoutria are robust erect perennial plants, growing from rhizomes. They are usually monoecious, with mostly bisexual flowers, but also some unisexual flowers. The petals of the flowers are dry and paperlike when mature. The fruits are achenes with threefold sharp edges. The inflorescence is in the form of a panicle. The flowers have separated triangular stigmas with fringes (fimbriate) borne on long divided styles. Taxonomy The genus Reynoutria was erected by Maarten Houttuyn in 1777 for the species R. japonica. It was named in honour of Herr von Reynoutre who had been reported to have done a great deal of service to botany. As with many species in the family Polygonaceae, the taxonomic boundaries of Reynoutria have been much confused; in particular, it has been repeatedly merged with and separated from Fallopia. A series of molecular phylogenetic studies have clarified relationships; Reynoutria is a well-supported monophyletic taxon. Reynoutria is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera Muehlenbeckia and Fallopia s.s., forming the so-called \\"RMF clade\\".

Women and men working towards universal suffrage had to combat earlier feminist goals that prioritized social goals, including access to education, political rights such as a woman's right to vote and equal wages. As a middle class developed and women gained more access to education, they began to focus more on the issue of suffrage but this was often around specific ideological philosophies; it was not tied into a broader working class movement calling for women's emancipation. Between 1877 and 1930, several attempts were made to give women the right to vote. The Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera would see a two-year period where women held the right to vote, from 1924 to 1926. Because of a move from an elected congress to an appointed government, no elections were held in this period and women never went to the polls. Unsuccessful attempts to give women suffrage also took place in 1877, 1907, 1908 and 1918. Despite this, Primo de Rivera's royal decree and the arguments put forward in that period would prove influential during the debate in the period to come. The Second Republic would see women granted full emancipation, including the right to vote, on 1 October 1931 with women going to the polls only twice: on 2 November 1933 and again in 1936. The right to vote came after the passing of a constitution after elections in June 1931. Both sides of the suffrage movement had women representing their causes in one of the greatest duels between Spanish parliamentarians. Clara Campoamor Rodr√≠guez represented those seeking full emancipation for women, while the left-leaning Victoria Kent Siano represented conservative and Republican views seeking to prevent women's right to vote. Campoamor claimed that women's access to the ballot box was an ethical obligation for the Congress and that Spanish women had won it having battled on behalf of the Republic for a long time. Kent argued women were not yet ready to vote as they were not sufficiently educated to make an informed decision, submitting to the wishes of their husbands and the Church, a position supported by the conservatives although they had different reasons for resisting women's suffrage. Following Francisco Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War, neither women nor men would be able to vote in national elections until 1977, two years after his death.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800 - 1922)  Spanish women did not hold the same status as citizens as men from 1800 to 1931. Single Spanish women enjoyed a few more legal rights than their married peers once they reached the age of 23. At that point, unmarried women could sign contracts and run businesses on their own behalf. Married women needed the approval or involvement of their husbands to undertake such matters as changing their address, accepting an inheritance, or owning property or a business. All women in this period were denied the right to vote or run for political office. Catholicism played a huge role in Spanish political thinking in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Religion required strict gender roles, which led to the repression of Spanish women and fostered ingrained sexism across the whole of Spanish society. Society, through the Catholic Church, dictated that the role of women was to marry and bear children. They were to be invisible in society outside the domestic sphere. Violations of these norms was often met with violence. Near universal male suffrage in Spain dated only to 1890. The first vote related to women's suffrage came in May 1877, when seven deputies in the conservative congress, suggested giving women the right to vote if they were of legal age, heads of households exercising parental authority. This initiative failed and would not be revisited for another 30 years. Suffrage as an in issue appeared in women's publications in places like Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Barcelona from the late 1900s to the early 1930s, but were often part of a demand for female emancipation through education and broader changes in laws to protect social changes as women increasingly entered the workforce. Benita Asas Manterola, Pilar Fern√°ndez Selfa, Carmen Gonz√°lez Bravo and Joaqu√≠n Latorre were among the more important voices in newspapers in this regard. Overall, feminists movements were much more concerned with providing women with an education that was equitable to that of men instead of securing the right to vote. Women like Bel√©n S√°rraga and Ana Carvia created the Asociaci√≥n General Femenina in 1897, and other women created La Uni√≥n Femenina in 1895 in Huelva, La Federaci√≥n Provincial in 1898 in M√°laga and Hijas de la Regeneraci√≥n that same year in C√°diz. Their efforts would lead to women having the right to attend university recognized by Ministerio P√∫blico in 1910. During this period, the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol (PSOE) did not generally want to address women's rights as they saw the movement as bourgeois. They wanted to focus on union organization. This contrasted little from the international socialist movement, which always had problems with feminism and women's rights. The International Socialist Congress, Stuttgart 1907 issued a statement in favor of women's suffrage, but said the movement needed to come from the proletariat. The conditional support was because men believed that women's rights should only come after universal male suffrage. Including women's suffrage more openly would hinder their efforts.* The limited inclusion came about as a result First International Conference of Socialist Women which was being held concurrently in the same building. For a brief time between July 1907, Congressional President Antonio Maura had discussed the possibility of giving women the right to vote under limited conditions, including they be were widowed heads of households and they paid their taxes. Despite being aided by the left and by Republicans, Maura's efforts proved ineffectual even with conditions requiring heads of household status and no possibility of women running for office; there was no perceived pressing social need by the conservative majority to give women to vote, and more important domestic problems like a war with Morocco were on the horizons, along with an economic recession. A year later, Count of Casa-Valencia, this time in the Senate, with support from Francisco Pi y Arsuaga in the Congress, would press the issue again. The 1908 attempt lacked restrictions that Maura had been willing to make to see its passage. It would have allowed all women aged 23 and older to vote. Unlike the 1907 efforts, the 1908 votes came within a few votes of passing. According to Concha Fagoaga , for the first time, those that argued against women's suffrage argued that it would lead to disastrous political results, and women would be overly influenced by Church officials. This was the first time a woman had argued along these lines, and it would soon be taken up by others. Carmen de Burgos wrote in a newspaper that year of the parliamentary debate in 1908, \\"while the English fight in a devilish way for their civic ideals, while the French claim to affirm in laws the guarantee of their selfishness, while the Russians know how to die protesting from tyranny, we, the Spanish, remain indifferent to everything.\\" Margarita Nelken wrote in El F√≠garo at the time that \\"putting a vote in the hands of women is today, in Spain, performing one of the greater yearnings of the reactionary element so that Spanish women, really lovers of freedom, must be the first to postpone their own interest for the progress of Spain.\\" Nelken did not believe Spanish women were ready to vote as they were not educated enough to do so, a position she continued to hold for more than 25 years. The suffrage topic was brought up again in 1919, with Manuel de Burgos y Mazo, a conservative lawmaker, raising it in Congress, with the goal of tabling legislation to have a vote on women's right to vote. With no support, his initiative did not even come up for a vote though it would inspire feminists over the next two years. A petition then was put before the C√°mara in 1919 that Parliament should address the issue of women's suffrage again. This was followed up in February 1920 with Valencia's Progreso de la Mujer also creating a petition for the matter to be considered. Cruzada de Mujeres Espa√±olas, led by Carmen de Burgos, would again try to get parliament to address the issue, by giving equality in the vote and in terms of broader civil and political rights. National Association of Spanish Women (ANME) was founded in 1918. Headed by Mar√≠a Espinosa, it lobbied for women's right to vote. The Female Republican Union was created by Clara Campoamor to advocate for women's suffrage in Spain. Campoamor, Mar√≠a Lej√°rraga and Regina Garc√≠a established the Foundation for Women to advocate for women's legal equality in Spain during the Second Republic. Their argument for women having the right to vote was largely based upon ideological grounds. Starting in the 1920s, the efforts of women to get the right to vote intensified as part of a broader western movement that saw women demanding equal rights. These efforts post-dated efforts in other Western countries like the United States, France and Great Britain because feminism in Spain did not emerge as a powerful movement until much later as a result of a delay in the emergence of a Spanish middle class. Suffrage as a topic among this feminist group would largely disappear from 1918 until 1931, as women focused more on social changes than on political goals. The socialist Lidia Falc√≥n argued that the Socialist men's position would deter women from adhering to the party, or would result in only including women who believed in subservience to men. Falc√≥n further argued this position would make feminists enemies of the party, a development that was born out by 1921, when Socialist men decided that to stop any attempt to promote the rights of women as they did not believe it was the time to push for electoral reforms.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930)  When political activity occurred by women in the pre-Republican period, it was often spontaneous. Although they were also often ignored by left-wing male political leaders, their riots and protests represented increasing political awareness of the need for women to be more active in social and political spheres to enact change in order to improve their lives. The 8 March 1924 Royal Decree's Municipal Statue Article 51 for the first time included an appendix which would allow electoral authorities on a municipal level to list women over the age of 23 who were not controlled by male guardians or the state to be counted. Article 84.3 said unmarried women could vote in municipal elections assuming they were the head of household, over the age of 23, not prostitutes and their status did not change. Changes were made the following month that allowed women who met these qualifications to run for political office. Consequently, some women took advantage of this political opening, ran for office and won some seats as councilors and mayors in municipal governments where elections were held. This was a surprise move by Primo de Rivera in giving women the right to vote, and was largely viewed as a way of shoring up his electoral base ahead of scheduled elections the following year. This brief period saw many political parties try to capture the women's vote before the elections were eventually cancelled. Manuel Cordero of El Socialista wrote in June 1924 of a right wing view stating that \\"the feminine vote supposes a revolutionary act and it seems strange that it is a reactionary who has projected this reform in Spain.\\" Socialist representative Mar√≠a Cambrils was pleased with women being given the right to vote, but balked at the restrictions placed upon female voters. PSOE's leader Andr√©s Saborit also supported this claiming that socialism needed to expand on how it saw women as transformational agents in society, and not allow the Catholic Church to monopolize on how women were defined in Spanish culture. Some Catholics tried to capitalize on this for their own political interests, achieving success when local elections in some places saw 40% of their total votes come from women. By the time of the next national elections, the constitution giving women the right to vote was no longer in force as a new constitution was being drafted. The arguments made around the 1924 Royal Decree would later play a critical role in the debates around women's suffrage in the Second Republic. Women gained access to national representation during the 1927‚Äì1929 legislative period as a result of the Decree of 12 September 1927. Its Article 15 stated: \\"to it may belong, without distinction, men and women, single, widowed or married, these duly authorized by their husbands and as long as they do not belong to the Assembly [...]. Its designation will be made nominally and by order of the Presidency, agreed in the Council of Ministers before October 6 next.\\" The 1927‚Äì1929 session also began the process of drafting a new Spanish constitution that would have fully franchised women voters in Article 55. The article was not approved. Despite this, women were eligible to serve in the national assembly in the Congreso de los Diputados, and 15 women were appointed to seats on 10 October 1927. Thirteen were members of the National Life Activities Representatives (). Another two were State Representatives (). These women included Mar√≠a de Maeztu, Micaela D√≠az Rabaneda and Concepci√≥n Loring Heredia. During the Congreso de los Diputados's inaugural session in 1927, the President of the Assembly specifically welcomed the new women, claiming their exclusion had been unjust. The abdication of king of Spain in 1930 would spell the end of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, and usher in the era of the Second Republic.  Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1937)  One of the most important aspects of the Second Republic for women is that they were formally allowed to enter the public sphere en masse. The period also saw a number of rights available to women for the first time, including suffrage, divorce and access to higher education. These resulted from feminist activities that pre-dated the Second Republic and continued throughout its durationg.Women exercising the right to vote during the Second Spanish Republic, 5th of November 1933. One of the first laws implemented in the Second Republic following the approval of a new constitution allowed women to vote and to run for political office. This was covered under Article 36 of Chapter III of the Constitution of the Second Republic, and came into force on 1 October 1931. The first women to win seats in the Cortes were Clara Campoamor Rodr√≠guez, Victoria Kent Siano and Margarita Nelken y Mansbergen. They won these seats in June 1931, several months before women were given the right to vote. They were joined in February 1936 by Matilde de la Torre, Dolores Ib√°rruri and Federica Montseny. Nelken and Kent had both opposed giving women's suffrage, arguing most women would vote for conservatives because of the influence of their husbands and the clergy, thus undermining the Spanish Republic. Campoamor, in contrast, was a strong advocate of women's suffrage. The duel between Campoamor and Kent over women's suffrage was the most significant of its kind in Spain's parliamentary history. The measure in the constitution passed on 1 October 1931 as Article 36, stating, \\"Citizens of either sex, over twenty-three years of age, shall have the same electoral rights as determined by the laws.\\" Despite Nelken's opposition to women's suffrage, PSOE members overwhelmingly supported the issue when it came to the vote with 161 in favor and 131 against. 83 of Nelken's fellow 115 PSOE deputies supported the motion. With its passage, Spain became the first Latin country to offer universal suffrage. The inclusion was supported by Article II of the new constitution, which provided equality under the law for both sexes. Montseny became Spain's first female minister, serving as the Minister of Health and Public Assistance from September 1936 to May 1937.  Elections in the Second Republic  \\"Rep√∫blica Espa√±ola\\" (1931) by painter Teodoro Andreu. The Spanish monarchy ended in 1931. Following this and the end of the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Second Republic was formed, with three elections before it was replaced by the Franco dictatorship. These elections were held in 1931, 1933 and 1936.  June 1931 Elections  Following the failure of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Spain set about writing a constitution. The initial draft did not give women the right to vote, though it did give them the right to run for office on 8 May 1931 for the June elections. Women would be unable to vote until the following election cycle. Three women won seats in Spain's national congress, the Cortes, in the 1931 elections: Clara Campoamor Rodr√≠guez, Victoria Kent Siano and Margarita Nelken y Mansbergen. Campoamor, in arguing for women's suffrage before the Cortes on 1 October 1931, that women were not being given the right to vote as a prize, but as a reward for fighting for the Republic. Women protested the war in Morocco, those in Zaragoza protested the war in Cuba, while even larger numbers protested the closure of Ateneo de Madrid by the government of Primo de Rivera. Campoamor also argued that women's inclusion was fundamental to saving the Republic by having a politically engaged populace, so that the errors of the French Republic would not be repeated. Her speech in the Cortes, called the 1 - 0 speech, said, \\"Women! How can you say that when women show signs of life by the Republic shall be granted as a reward for the right to vote? Have they not fought women for the Republic? Is that in speaking with praise Women workers and university women are not singing their capacity? [...] How can it be said that women have not fought and need a period, long years of the Republic, to demonstrate their capacity? The men?\\" Kent, in contrast, received much more support from Spain's right, including Catholics and traditionalists, during this period of constitutional debate as she, alongside Nelken, opposed women's suffrage. Kent and Campoamor became involved in a grand debate over the issue, receiving large amounts of press related to their arguments around women's suffrage. They, like many others on the conservative side, believed that women were not educated enough to vote, and that their votes would be little more than proxy votes for men and the Catholic Church. Kent stated: \\"It is not a matter of capacity, it is a matter of opportunity for the Republic. [...] To become attached to an ideal, time is needed to experience it. [...] And were women liberated in their conscience, I would rise today in front of all the Cortes to ask for the feminine vote.\\" The day of the vote, Kent said, \\"It is necessary, honorable deputies, to postpone the feminine vote because I would need to see the mothers in the street as a criterion for supporting it, asking for schools for their children.\\" Nelken compared the need for women's suffrage to that of Prussian peasant women in 1807. They would not know what to do with emancipation, and would tremble with fear at the thought of not having someone tell them what to do.  1933 Elections  Men and women wait at Escuela Biteri in Hernani to vote in the 1933 elections. For the first time, for the 19 November 1933 elections, women were permitted to vote in the national elections. They had earned the constitutional right to vote after the measure was adopted on 1 October 1931. In many places, the number of women exceeded the number of men at the polls, with over seven million women casting a ballot. The victory of conservative factions in the 1933 elections was blamed on women, and their voting practices in that election. They were viewed as being controlled by the Church. Basque women were able to go to the polls in regional elections 15 days before the national elections on 5 November 1933. La Voz de Guip√∫zcoa newspaper in Donostia said of the day, \\"It was Sunday when, for the first time in our city, the women went to the ballotbox, consulted for the issue of their vote in favor of the Statute. And the woman answered, coming in greater numbers than the male at first hour, as soon as the tables were set up at eight o'clock in the morning.\\" Campoamor, along with Kent, lost her seat in the Cortes following the 1933 elections. The most active of the three women elected in 1931, she had been heckled in the congress during her two-year term for supporting divorce. She continued to serve in government with an appointment as head of Public Welfare later that year. However, she left her post in 1934 protesting the government response to the 1934 Revolution of Asturias. Nelken faced similar problems in the Cortes. Her mother was French and her father was a German Jew. As a consequence, before she was allowed to sit in 1931, Nelken had to go through special bureaucratic procedures to insure she was a naturalized Spanish citizen. Her political interests were looked down upon by her male peers, including Prime Minister Manuel Aza√±a. Her feminist beliefs worried and threatened her male colleagues in the Cortes. Despite this, she was re-elected in 1933, facing attacks in the media. She proved a constant irritant to male party members who sometimes resorted to racist attacks in the Cortes to quieten her down. Still, she persevered, winning at the elections in 1931, 1933 and 1936. Disillusionment with the party led her to change membership to the Communist Party in 1937.  Women's political organizations   Female Republican Union  Clara Campoamor created the Female Republican Union (Uni√≥n Republicana de Mujeres) during the early part of the Second Republic. The Female Republican Union was interested only in advocating for women's suffrage, maintaining that women having the right to vote was the only ethical option available to the government. It was often polemicist in its opposition to Kent's group Foundation for Women, and its opposition to women's suffrage.  Foundation for Women  Victoria Kent and Margarita Nelken founded the Foundation for Women (Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Mujeres Espa√±ola) in 1918. The Foundation for Women was a radical socialist organization at its inception, aligning with the PSOE. The organization opposed women's suffrage, even as its founders sat in the Cortes. The belief was if women were given the right to vote, most would vote as instructed by their husbands and the Catholic Church. This would fundamentally damage the secular nature of the Second Republic, by bringing in a democratically elected right-wing government.  Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) and Francoist Spain (1938‚Äì1973)  No elections were held during the Spanish Civil War. Following the victory of fascist forces, the rights of both men and women were severely limited. Elections would not be held in Spain until 1977, following the death of Franco  References  Category:Women in the Spanish Civil War Category:History of women's rights Category:Women's suffrage in Spain Category:Women in Francoist Spain ","title":"Women's suffrage in the Spanish Civil War period"},{"id":"60068094","text":"Lov√≠sa Bj√∂rt Henningsd√≥ttir (born 11 October 1995) is an Icelandic basketball player for Haukar of the √örvalsdeild kvenna.

He was also a world- famous dealer of tribal art, described as having \\"a taste for the bizarre\\", and as \\"Indiana Jones meets Gene Simmons\\". He was also described as a treasure hunter who \\"is Indiana Jones, minus the rolling boulders, aliens and savage tribesmen\\". Jamieson came to international prominence when he discovered the lost mummy of pharaoh Ramses I following his purchase of the then defunct Niagara Falls Museum. He dealt in a diverse array of curios, including mummies and shrunken heads, and his clientele included the Royal Ontario Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sotheby's, Christie's, and rock stars such as Mick Jagger and Steven Tyler. He lived in a three-storey, downtown Toronto loft which doubled as a museum housing thousands of his acquired treasures. The Halloween parties at the loft have been described as \\"legendary\\", while his guests at the place included Tyler and Tim Burton. Jamieson died at his home on his 57th birthday, the same day his acquisition of the alleged head of Saint Vitalis of Assisi was completed. The head was acquired for ‚Ç¨3,500. After his death, hundreds of his exhibits were auctioned off. Life Jamieson lived in Brampton growing up and became a school drop-out at 14. Subsequently, he worked in sales for a time, and eventually became self-employed waterproofing basements. In 1995, he overdosed on PCP, an experience that led him to change his life path. Following the overdose, Jamieson sold his business and went to South America where he experimented with the entheogenic brew ayahuasca. It was during this time that he developed an interest in shrunken heads and started trading in them. He was self-educated and eventually became a world-famous art dealer whose clientele included the Royal Ontario Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Sotheby's, Christie's, and rock stars Mick Jagger and Steven Tyler.

Visitors to the loft included Steven Tyler and Tim Burton. Jamieson owned close to a dozen shrunken heads, and what amounted to one of the world's largest collections of them. After his death, his collection was auctioned off. Auction items included a piece of Jumbo's tusk, an electric chair, and a \\"butt in a box\\". Niagara Falls museum The mummy of Ramses I was found by Jamieson after the purchase of the Niagara Falls Museum. In 1999, Jamieson bought the then closed Niagara Falls Museum after having a drink of opium tea. There were approximately 700,000 objects in the museum collection. One of the mummies in the museum was later verified to be the mummy of pharaoh Ramses I, the founder of ancient Egypt's 19th dynasty. Ramses's mummy was subsequently sold to the Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta, Georgia for USD 2 million. The sale of the mummy of Ramses I made Jamieson famous internationally and widened his client base. The mummy was eventually returned to Egypt, with much fanfare. The Carlos Museum on their website did not mention that they acquired the mummy from Jamieson.

A total of 6860 cabriolet saloons and 866 estates were built in less than four years.  History  In November 1949, a pilot series of the cabriolet saloon Superior 600 was built in Plochingen, and in July 1950, the regular series production began at the Calw division. The standard model was offered until April 1954. At the 1950 Frankfurt Spring Fair, the cabriolet was presented; the public, however, did not show much interest. The \\"Superior-Sport\\", an expensive roadster with a Wendler body, was also less successful, despite being offered at a price of less than DM 8000. In 1951/52, only twelve units were built. Only two prototypes of a four-seater saloon that had been announced for 1954 have been built. In April 1954, the production of Gutbrod cars discontinued due running out of funds. The Calw and Plochingen divisions were sold to Bauknecht. Managed by Hans Scherenberg, Gutbrod cooperated with Robert Bosch GmbH and developed a mechanical petrol direct injection. At the same time, a similar system was also used by Goliath. Both manufacturers showed their direct- injected models at the 1951 International Motor Show Germany (IAA Frankfurt). They are considered the world's first mass-produced vehicles with petrol direct injection.Pioniertat Benzineinspritzung; auf: Zwischengas.com, retrieved 12 January 2018.

It had two seats, and initially, two initially suicide doors. Starting from 1951, the doors were hinged at the front and carpeted. In the Superior's first version, the boot was only accessible from inside; later, it received a lid. In 1952, the estate was presented. Whilst the bodies for the cabriolet saloons were made by Karosseriewerke Weinsberg, bodies for the estates were made by Westfalia.Reinhard Lintelmann: Die Motorroller und Kleinwagen der f√ºnfziger Jahre 3. Auflage, Verlag Walter Podszun, Brilon 1995, , p. 59‚Äì62 The vehicle has independent suspension, the front wheels were equipped with double control arms, coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers, in rear it had a pendulum axle, also equipped with coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers. Experiments with front transverse leaf springs had not led to a satisfying result. Hydraulically operated drum brakes on all wheels were standard.  Engine and transmission  The model 600 had a longitudinally mounted, water- cooled two-cylinder two-stroke engine in front. It displaced 593 cm¬≥ (bore √ó stroke = 71 mm √ó 75 mm) and was rated 20 to 22 PS (15 to 16 kW) at 3250 rpm. The model 600 Luxus had a more luxurious interior. In 1952, the 700 Luxus followed with 663 cm¬≥ engine (75 mm bore √ó 75 mm stroke) and 26 PS (19 kW) at 4300 rpm. As an alternative to this carburetted engine, Gutbrod offered an engine with petrol direct injector. This engine was rated 30 PS (22 kW) at same speed. All models had a single-disc dry clutch, a nonsynchronised three- speed gearbox, and front-wheel drive. In 1953, vehicles with 700 cm¬≥ engines were fitted with gearboxes that had synchromesh on the second and third gears only.Auto- und Motorradwelt, no. 6, 20 March 1953, Sportverlag Kurt Stoof, K√∂ln. The model 600 had an average fuel consumption of 7.5 l/100 km (38 mpg Imp.), and reached a top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph). The 700 Luxus fuel consumption was 7.5 l/100 km in its carburetted version, and 7.0 l/100 km (40 mpg Imp.) in its direct-injection version, which, unlike the carburetted version, had a dedicated autolube system. The modell 700 Luxus cabriolet saloons had a top speed of 110 km/h (68 mph) with the carburetted engine, and 115 km/h with the direct-injected engine. The estates reached top speeds of 100 km/h and 105 km/h (62 and 65 mph) respectively.  Motorsport  The popularity of the Gutbrod Superior was supported by its contributions to motorsport. The car was especially successful in long-distance competitions. In 1953, at the first 6 Hours of N√ºrburgring, a 1000 km race initiated by the ADAC on the N√ºrburgring, two Gutbrod Superiors participated.

It is most notable for its ancient cemetery, which is thought to date to the Bronze Age. Etymology The word \\"umm\\" is Arabic for \\"mother\\", and is a commonly used prefix used to signify geographic features. \\"Maa\\", the second constituent, is the Arabic word \\"water\\"; it was given this name in reference to multiple freshwater wells found in the area. Area description The immense region of Umm Al Maa is situated on the west coast of Qatar, around 80 km northwest of Doha and 55 km southwest of Madinat ash Shamal. For the most part, the area consists of level rocky plains and is accentuated with occasional low hillocks, depressions (rawdas) and furrows. Elevations of between 10 and 20 meters can be observed on its hillocks, which mainly comprise limestone but which are also composed of sedimentary depositions and sand. Rawdas of the area show great variations in size and length, with some only measuring a few meters in diameter and the largest depression, named Mleiha, having a length of several hundred meters. The area was long recognized for its abundance of potable water, as signified by its name. During rainy season, its multiple depressions would accommodate vast reservoirs of rainwater, which would supplement already-existing wells in the area, one of which is presently being used for a date palm plantation. Sabkhas (salt-flats) prevail on its coastline. Not much vegetation is to be found, with the exception of desert shrubs, prickly bushes, and on rare occasions, an Acacia tree. View of the flat, rocky desert behind Qala'at Umm Al Maa. Most of the human activity seems to have been concentrated in the central Mleiha depression, which has an area of approximately 25 km¬≤. However, the burial ground's boundaries are known to extend much further; at least from the coastline in the west to the highway between Al Jemailiya and Al Ghuwariyah in the east, and from as far north as the highway linking Zubarah and Al Ghuwariyah to the Dukhan Highway in the south. These boundaries would give it a minimum size of roughly 600 km¬≤. Many of the burial mounds are grouped around low hillocks or in the rawdas. The better portion of these burial sites are in abhorrent conditions as a result of grave robbers, chemical and wind weathering, human traffic and recreational off-roading. These mounds are overlain mainly with limestone and on average have diameters of between 3 and 6 meters and stand from 10 cm to 1 meter tall. Similar ancient cemeteries have been observed at Ar Rakiyat to the north and at a smaller scale near the city of Al Khor on the eastern coast. Although the first official estimate of tombs was put at roughly 50 by the Danes in late 1950s, a German archaeological team that conducted a preliminary survey of the site in 2008 claimed there were at least a few hundred, if not thousands of mounds. Settlement British archaeologist Beatrice de Cardi and her team were the first to study the settlement at Umm Al Maa in any great detail. Most remarkable among their discoveries were Indian Red Polished Ware and glazed earthenware, which they dated to the Sasanian period (c. third century AD to seventh century AD). The German archaeological team which carried out a preliminary survey of the area in 2008 noted that it had not found conclusive evidence of a settlement. Remnants of various stone structures were observed, but the majority were associated fire pits, prayer areas, barns and tent corrals, all of which would point towards more recent origins. The most convincing evidence of prior settlement was uncovered in the Mleiha depression near the only water well still in use, where outcroppings of old structures can be spotted. However, an earthenware fragment found by the team near the well was said not to be older than 200 to 300 years, thus this area may also be associated with more recent habitation. The team theorized that the ancient cairns were likely constructed by nomads rather than settled peoples, as the climate and geography of the area discouraged a sedentary lifestyle. Graveyard Discovery A view of some of the mounds at Umm Al Maa. In 1957, an ancient graveyard containing 50 cairns was found here by a Danish archaeological duo consisting of Geoffrey Bibby and Peter Glob. The average cairn had a 10-meter diameter and stood around 1 meter tall. One of the cairns uncovered by the Danes in 1957, which had a diameter of 6 meters, a height of 0.6 meters and a length of 1.9 meters, was of particular interest. Further investigation uncovered that it had a stone cist with three roof slabs (flat rocks used to cover a grave) encompassed by smaller rocks. The cist was facing north-to-south and was fitted into the bedrock. Within the cist lied a skeleton facing towards the north. As no grave products were found alongside the skeleton, the Danes were unable to date it. However, they were able to date pit fired earthenware and sherds of an alabaster bowl found in the cairns. They postulated that the cairns and pottery most likely dated to the Bronze Age (c. 3,000 BC), which they concluded by comparison of similar Bronze Aged cairns found in Bahrain. Japanese Archaeological Mission First season Picking up where the Danes left off was a Japanese archaeological mission which comprised Masatoshi A Konishi, Takeshi Gotoh and Yoshihiko Akashi. They surveyed Qatar from 1988 to 1991. The Japanese team released their first report on the cairns in 1989. In their second report, they referred to these sites as 'burial mounds' rather than cairns. A burial mound dubbed J-2 by the Japanese team was found in an oval arrangement measuring 3.4 meters by 2.5 meters. Upon removing the roof slabs, a cist was uncovered. It was roughly 1.7 meters long and 0.3 meters wide. It comprised five or six substantial stone sections placed around the walls of a rectangular pit excavated into the bedrock. Inside the cist, a skeleton was found whose heading was roughly NWN-SES. As the skeleton was delicate, fallen slabs had fractured its head into several pieces. The skeleton belonged to a woman who was likely in late adulthood. No grave artifacts were found alongside the skeleton. Second season Amid the second season, 1990‚Äì91, the Japanese group unearthed two burial complexes labelled J-3 and J-4, which featured a series of oval burial mounds measuring between 4 and 8 meters in diameter. The mounds were heaped on a thin, level layer of dark-colored sand with a depth of 4 to 8 centimeters. The mounds themselves were made mainly of light-colored sand and were slightly slanted. After the mounds were dug up, oval arrangements of intently piled stones with recessed centers were uncovered. Disturbance of some of the mounds by grave robbers was readily apparent. Both complexes contained burial chambers covered by roof slabs and heaps of pebbles. Within one of the chambers, a skeleton was discovered, but it had decayed beyond the point of recognition, and no further information could be discerned. Artifacts recovered from the chamber include a little circular bead made of dark transparent flint glass and fragments of a bronze or copper bowl. More artifacts were discovered in the other chamber, including a cylindrical- shaped agate bead, two circular flint glass beads, pieces of bronze and copper rings, and an intact bronze and copper ring. Further items were found beneath the mound, including a stone mortar and fragments of pottery. There was little consistency in the planning of these burial chambers and the accommodations for their inhabitants. For instance, some were built to accommodate bodies in a contracted position, while others seemed to have been built to house more than one corpse. The Japanese team noted the similarity of the pottery and other finds to those of a Seleucid site on Failaka Island and posited a date of sometime between the first century BC and the first century AD. Archaeologist Muhammad Abdul Nayeem has stated that these burials were reminiscent of graves purportedly built by nomads in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia around the third millennium BC.

The Riddler has been voiced by John Glover in the DC animated universe, Robert Englund in The Batman, and Wally Wingert in the Batman: Arkham video game series. He has also been portrayed by Frank Gorshin and John Astin in the 1960s Batman television series, Jim Carrey in the 1995 film Batman Forever, Cory Michael Smith in the FOX television show Gotham, and Paul Dano in the upcoming 2021 film The Batman. Television Live action * The Riddler appears in the 1960s Batman television series and as one of the villains in the theatrical film spin-off. Frank Gorshin portrayed Riddler in the first and third season of the series and the film and John Astin portrayed Riddler in the second season. He made four appearances in season 1 (more than any other villain) but was reduced to only one appearance per season afterwards. The popular television series was inspired by the first Silver Age appearance of the Riddler, with the premiere episode being an adaptation of Batman #171. Frank Gorshin would win an Emmy Award for his performance, which elevated the character's popularity into becoming a major member of Batman's rogues gallery of enemies. * Frank Gorshin also portrayed the Riddler in Legends of the Superheroes in 1979. * Edward Nygma is featured in the TV series Gotham, where he is portrayed by Cory Michael Smith. This version is a forensic scientist working for the Gotham City Police Department who has a fondness for expressing findings in the form of riddles. He eventually turns to crime, however, and terrorizes Gotham as the Riddler. The series traces his evolution into a master criminal, as well as his complicated, love‚Äìhate relationship with fellow criminal Oswald Cobblepot. * In the fourth episode of the first season of the NBC series Powerless, the Riddler sends his henchmen to Charm City to steal a weapon from Wayne Security that would allow him to attack Arkham Asylum. One of the Riddler's henchmen (Robert Buckley) dates Emily Locke, who worked for the firm, in an attempt to get close to the weapon. Their plot is foiled when Van Wayne enters the office in a Robin costume and the Riddler's henchmen all scatter, thinking that Batman must be nearby. Animation DC animated universe The Riddler as he appeared in Batman: The Animated Series (left) and The New Batman Adventures (right) * The Riddler appears in the DC animated universe, voiced by John Glover. For this version, the producers decided to play against the popular Frank Gorshin image of a cackling trickster to avoid confusion with the Joker, instead portraying the character as a smooth intellectual who presents genuinely challenging puzzles and dressed in a more sedate version of Frank Gorshin's preferred costume for the character from the 1960s live-action series. The series's creators admit they did not use him often because his character often made story plots too long, too complex or too bizarre, and the creators also found it very hard to devise the villain's riddles.Comics Scene #43, published by Starlog ** Riddler appears in Batman: The Animated Series. The character's design consists of a green suit and a purple mask. In his debut episode \\"If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?\\", Edward Nygma becomes the Riddler after being unjustly fired by his greedy employer, Dan Mockridge, whom he tries to kill. Despite Batman solving his riddles, he evades capture and has the satisfaction of leaving Mockridge plagued with a terrifying paranoia of the Riddler striking again. The Riddler later appears in \\"What Is Reality?\\", where he returns to delete his identity and locks Commissioner Gordon into a virtual reality world. Batman outsmarts him, however, and finally apprehends the villain by solving his riddle. Unlike the other villains that escaped Arkham Asylum, Riddler is actually released due to good behavior. He returns in the episode \\"Riddler's Reform\\", where he works at a toy company and uses his Riddler persona to advertise them and make millions. However, Riddler finds that he cannot control his need to commit riddle-based crimes, and eventually makes a seemingly inescapable deathtrap for Batman. The Dark Knight manages to survive, however and apprehends him. When Batman refuses to tell him how he escaped, Riddler is returned to Arkham, plagued continuously by Batman's survival. ** Riddler makes cameo appearances in The New Batman Adventures. The character's design is completely different: lacking the hair and mask and dressed in a unitard with a large question mark. In the episode \\"Over the Edge\\", Riddler was seen on a talk show with the other Batman villains in Batgirl's nightmare induced by Scarecrow's fear gas. In the episode \\"Judgement Day\\", Riddler was among the victims of the vigilante known as The Judge at the time he was crashing a banquet, being crushed by The Judge. ** Riddler appears in Superman: The Animated Series. In the episode \\"Knight Time\\", he is in league with Bane and the Mad Hatter to take advantage of Batman's recent disappearance. However, Riddler is quickly captured by Superman (dressed as Batman) and Robin, being the latter the one who handcuffs him to the cage where he had locked him. ** Riddler makes a silent cameo appearance on Batman Beyond. In the episode \\"Black Out\\", one of Riddler's costumes is seen on display at the Batcave.

In the episode, Terry's Friend Dates a Robot\\", an android drone in the guise of the Riddler fights the new Batman (Terry McGinnis). When asked about Riddler's fate, show's creator Paul Dini jokingly stated that the Riddler retired and started running a men's clothing store with the Mad Hatter as his partner.ToyFare issue, 1999 ** Riddler was originally planned to appear in the third season of Justice League Unlimited, as a member of the Legion of Doom. Due to the Bat-embargo, this was not possible. This would have been a tribute to his appearance in Challenge of the Super Friends as one of the original 13 members of the Legion of Doom. ** In Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker a mannequin of the Riddler is seen in the Batcave. Other shows * The Riddler made his first appearance in animated form in the Filmation Batman installments have first seen on CBS Saturday Morning in 1968 as part of The Batman/Superman Hour, with Ted Knight providing his voice. * The Riddler did not appear in the 1977 The New Adventures of Batman episodes.

The Riddler as he appears in Challenge of the Super Friends * The Riddler appeared in Hanna-Barbera's Challenge of the Super Friends, voiced by Michael Bell. He appears as a member of the Legion of Doom and usually gives riddles to the Super Friends to delay them from meddling with the Legion's plans. In \\"Monolith of Evil\\", he uses a riddle to trick the Super Friends into getting a Monolith of enormous power guarded by a Lava Monster for the Legion after they fooled the Super Friends into abducting the United Nations and disguising the Monolith as the United Nations. * Riddler made his only solo appearance in the 1980s series Super Friends, again voiced by Michael Bell. In the short episode \\"Around the World in 80 Riddles\\", he uses his new Stupid Spray (which slowly causes the intelligence of those sprayed upon to be reduced to the intelligence of 2 year-olds) on Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman and Robin, where different riddles will provide clues where the antidote can be found. The first one quotes \\"As your I.Q. drops to below 22, you'll need mya help to tya your shoes\\". The answer to the riddle led Super Friends to the Mayan ruins, where they ended up in one of Riddler's deathtraps. After barely escaping the deathtrap, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman and Robin find what appeared to be the antidote only to be a container for another riddle. The riddle reads \\"You're probably so dumb now, you need a simple clue. So find the tallest mountain and climb until you're blue\\". Due to the group's dwindling intelligence, Batman had to use the Batcomputer on his Batplane to decipher the riddle, with the answer being Mount Everest. Upon arriving at Mount Everest, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Robin encounter Riddler's blimp, where the Stupid Spray is at its final part on them. The Super Friends managed to claim the Stupid Spray Antidote and defeat Riddler. In \\"Revenge of Doom\\", Riddler was with the Legion of Doom when they got back together. The Riddler as he appears in The Batman * In 2005, a interpretation of the Riddler debuted in The Batman episode \\"Riddled\\", voiced by Robert Englund. This version exhibits a Gothic appearance and is served by henchmen called Riddlemen. The episode \\"Riddler's Revenge\\" reveals that Nygma and his partner Julie (voiced by Brooke Shields) worked at a university on a device to enhance the human brain. Nygma was approached by a man named Gorman (voiced by Bob Gunton) who offered to buy the rights to the invention, but Nygma refused. After the device malfunctioned at a demonstration, Nygma accused Gorman of sabotage. After an attempt to kill Gorman, Nygma fled when Batman rescued him. By the episode \\"Riddled\\", Nygma has adopted his Riddler persona. Years later in \\"Riddler's Revenge\\", Nygma tried to kill Gorman again, but Batman stopped him and Nygma realized it was not Gorman who sabotaged him but his own partner Julie, who betrayed Nygma out of greed, which broke Nygma's heart. * The Riddler is featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by John Michael Higgins. He is mentioned but not seen during Batman's call to Commissioner Gordon in \\"Deep Cover For Batman!\\". In the teaser for \\"A Bat Divided!\\", Riddler has a game show 'Riddle Me This' where Booster Gold fails to solve the riddles, harming Batman. Batman eventually frees himself and the two fight Riddler and his henchmen. Batman's riddle to Riddler is \\"Why are you like a clock in cement\\" with the answer being \\"Because your both doing hard time.\\" In the main story of \\"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\\", he was the target of revenge by Batwoman, whom he had humiliated ten years earlier by unmasking her in public. * The Riddler appears in the Young Justice cartoon series, voiced by Dave Franco. In \\"Terrors\\", he is an inmate of Belle Reve who escapes. In \\"Misplaced\\", a spell cast by Klarion the Witch Boy, Wotan, Blackbriar Thorn, Felix Faust and Wizard splits the Earth into two dimensions as a diversion to enable Riddler and Sportsmaster to steal an organism from S.T.A.R. Labs. In \\"Usual Suspect\\", Riddler joins Cheshire, Mammoth and Shimmer in ambushing the Young Justice Team at a crashed airplane. He did a riddle upon the attack about a type of plant to which Robin answered \\"Ambush.\\" Riddler is incapacitated by Zatanna and reveals Hugo Strange as a member of the Light. * The Riddler appears in the DC Nation Shorts, voiced by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic in the \\"Riddle Me This!\\" short.

This version doesn't wear a mask and has a shaved head. In the episode \\"E. Nygma, Consulting Detective\\" after being released from Arkham Asylum, Riddler helps Wonder Woman and Green Arrow find Batman after he was captured by Joker and due to the fact that Joker is stealing his riddle motif. The riddles that Riddler deciphers takes them to Solomon Grundy's cell where Riddler distracts him with a finger trap puzzle, the Iceberg Lounge where the riddle was under Penguin's trick umbrella, and the Gotham Art Museum where Joker gets Wonder Woman trapped. Upon Green Arrow freeing himself from the ribbon trap, he and Wonder Woman save Batman from being cut by the Lady of Justice statue when Joker tempts Riddler to use the voice-activated trap upon solving the Mississippi riddle. Upon Joker being apprehended, it was revealed that Joker did this because Riddler ate his doughnut. As Riddler walked off, he quotes \\"Riddle me this, Gotham. Who's getting better and better every day in every way? Me.\\" * The Riddler appears in the web series DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. He appears as a student at Super Hero High. * The Riddler appears in the Harley Quinn animated series, voiced by Jim Rash.https://www.eonline.com/photos/28987/life-after-community/958756 In \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\", he is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum, but triggers a mass breakout after smuggling in an orange seed for Poison Ivy. He later starts a crime wave before capturing both Batman and Harley Quinn in a death trap to force Joker to save one of them. After the clown prince chooses Batman, Riddler reveals the trap was fake and that he teamed up with Ivy to convince Harley that Joker doesn't love her. Following this, he makes minor sporadic appearances throughout the rest of season one, some of which established him as a member of the Legion of Doom. In the season two premiere, \\"New Gotham\\", following the Legion and Gotham's destruction, Riddler formed the Injustice League alongside fellow survivors Two-Face, Bane, Penguin, and Mr. Freeze to take advantage of the chaos and divide what's left of Gotham between them. In the following episode, \\"Riddle U\\", after having dealt with Penguin, Harley and her crew go after Riddler next, who's set up shop in Gotham University, upon learning his territory has power and clean water. Along the way, they discover he used kidnapped co-eds as human batteries and receive assistance from Barbara Gordon to take him down before using him to power their mall lair. Despite being able to escape, he chooses not to for the time being as the mall offers several benefits that Gotham's wasteland does not. In the episode \\"Dye Hard\\", having become muscular after running on the wheel for an extended time, Riddler is released by Doctor Psycho, who left Harley's crew to seek revenge against them, to steal a mind control helmet so Psycho can strengthen his psionic powers and enslave an army of Parademons to take over Gotham. Despite their best efforts, they are ultimately defeated in the episode \\"Lovers' Quarrel\\", and subsequently imprisoned at Arkham in \\"The Runaway Bridesmaid\\". Film Live-action * Frank Gorshin reprised his role as the Riddler in the 1966 theatrical film Batman, alongside three other villains from the television series. As in the series, Gorshin's Riddler is wildly unpredictable; calm and calculating at one moment, then deluded and unstable the next. He compulsively sends Batman and Robin clues, which in the film leads to some minor tension with his fellow criminals. Jim Carrey as the Riddler, from Batman Forever (1995) * Jim Carrey portrays the Riddler in the 1995 film Batman Forever. In this version, Edward Nygma is an eccentric and amoral inventor who works at Wayne Enterprises' research and development department as employee and is obsessed with Bruce Wayne. Believes that Wayne has a perfect life because of being wealthy and handsome, Nygma imitates Wayne such as looks and wearings, wealth, beautiful companions, company, and even his own signal projecting above Gotham City after discovering that Wayne is Batman, signs that he has a schizophrenic disorder of echopraxia. He also sees his goals as games to win and would not accept any defeat thereby is vain. Nygma invents a device called \\"the Box\\" that transmits images directly into the user's mind. He sees it as the next generation of television, but Wayne rejects the idea, as mental manipulation raises concerns over ethics and safety, resulting in Nygma becomes vengeful towards Wayne over the rejection. Nygma ultimately discovers that his device can drain people of their intellect to increase his own intelligence. After killing his supervisor, he compulsively starts sending riddles to Wayne. From the riddles, Wayne's love interest Dr. Chase Maridian (whom Nygma later infatuates) correctly diagnosed that Wayne's stalker is dangerously insane, who is obsessive with homicidal tendencies, seeking to best Wayne through challenge before he kills him. He dons the Riddler identity, allies himself with Two-Face and steals vast amounts of money and jewels to fund his own company, Nygmatech, and mass- produce his invention. The devices transfer the stolen information to a gigantic Mother Box on Claw Island, where it is planted in the Riddler's mind, though the overload of information slowly begins to damage his already unstable mind. In the process, he learns that Wayne is Batman. He and Two-Face raid Wayne Manor, destroy the Batcave, and kidnap Meridian, and his new crimefighting partner Robin. In the film's climactic scene, Riddler's compulsion to defeat Batman instead of killing him immediately after discovering his identity proves to be his undoing; Batman destroys the Mother Box, causing the information in it to flow unregulated into the Riddler's head, damaging his brain irreparably even after a neurosurgery. The Riddler is locked up in Arkham Asylum, where the delusional Nygma believes that he himself is Batman as revealed when being visited by Dr. Meridian. The Riddler's costume later appears with Two-Face's in the sequel, Batman & Robin, in the background of a scene in Arkham Asylum. * Paul Dano will portray the Riddler in Matt Reeves' upcoming film The Batman, which is separate from the DC Extended Universe. In this film, the Riddler goes by his birth name of Edward Nashton and is a serial killer who targets corrupt high-ranking Gotham City officials. He will serve as the film's main antagonist.

Batman rescues Riddler from a black ops assassination led by Amanda Waller and has him incarcerated at Arkham Asylum. Waller forms the Suicide Squad to infiltrate Arkham Asylum in order to retrieve a memory stick containing information of all Suicide Squad members in Riddler's cane, though her real motive is to kill the Riddler, as he is the only person who knows how to deactivate the bombs that are surgically attached to the spines of the Suicide Squad members. He reveals this knowledge to Killer Frost when she is sent to kill him on Waller's instruction. The Suicide Squad then agree to spare the Riddler in exchange for his help, and most are able to deactivate their bombs with the use of a device intended for electroshock therapy. Only Black Spider (who had been separated from the group) and King Shark (whose skin is too thick) are killed by Waller when she realizes what has happened. When everyone notices that the man wearing the \\"Black Spider\\" costume is still alive, the amused Riddler deduces that he is in fact, Batman. He is quickly subdued after trying to shoot Batman but escapes after the freed Joker sets all the patients of Arkham loose. * The Riddler appears in Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders and its sequel Batman vs. Two-Face, voiced by Wally Wingert, reprising his role from the Arkham video games. * The Riddler appears in The Lego Batman Movie, voiced by Conan O'Brien.

After the driver stopped his car, Riddler tears his left arm off with his cane, leaving the car to be hit by a truck that Captain Boomerang and Two-Face has stolen. He later invades Commissioner Gordon's retirement party with the other villains, but Joker has them all surrender to the police. Confused, Riddler asks \\"Riddle me this. What just happened?\\" He later breaks out of Arkham Asylum and teams up with Batman to save the city from the Phantom Zone inmates that Joker released and keep Gotham City from coming apart over the void. * The Brave and the Bold version of the Riddler appears in Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold, with John Michael Higgins reprising his role. Riddler is revealed to have started his career as a lab assistant to Professor Milo and seeks to revive a dimensional portal project he was involved in. * The Riddler appears Batman: Hush, voiced by Geoffrey Arend. Like in the comics, Riddler deduced Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne while using a Lazarus Pit to cure his untreatable brain tumor. The movie deviates from the comic with Riddler taking on the identity of Hush instead of his doctor Tommy Elliot due to his lack of respect among other villains. He then manipulated numerous villains in a series of schemes to destroy Batman on multiple fronts while having Clayface assume his identity to make it appear he has been incarcerated in Arkham. But when the plan fails, Riddler kidnaps Catwoman to lure Batman to an abandoned factory and overpower him with his newly enhanced strength. But a freed Catwoman helps Batman push Riddler over a vat of molten metal, with the Riddler killed by Catwoman cutting the rope to prevent Batman from endangering himself when he attempts to rescue the villain. Video games Batman: Arkham Concept artwork of the Riddler for Batman: Arkham City The Riddler is prominently featured in all four primary installments of the Batman: Arkham video game series, where he is voiced by Wally Wingert. In addition to serving as one of the many supervillains that Batman has to apprehend, his presence provides much of the puzzle solving content found in each game. * While the Riddler does not make a physical appearance in the series' first entry, Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), he hacks into Batman's communication system early on in the story and persistently challenges the Dark Knight to solve various riddles located throughout Arkham Island and its various facilities. When Batman deciphers all of the Riddler's challenges, he is able to triangulate the Riddler's location in Gotham City and the villain is subsequently arrested by the police. Audiotapes of Arkham psychiatrists' interview sessions with the Riddler can also be found in the game, which reveals that when Edward Nashton won a riddle-solving contest at school, his abusive father accused him of cheating and proceeded to beat him, resulting in his obsession with riddles as a way to prove his intellectual superiority. * The Riddler makes his first physical appearance in the sequel, Batman: Arkham City (2011). He, along with all of the other villains in Gotham, is captured and sent to Professor Hugo Strange's Arkham City, a lawless and walled city whose inmate inhabitants are free to wreak havoc. The Riddler kidnaps former Arkham guard Aaron Cash's medical protection team from the church, places them in deathtraps and threatens to murder them in order to force Batman to solve his riddles scattered throughout Arkham City. To discover the locations of Riddler's various trophies, challenges, and riddles, Batman interrogates his henchmen, who are embedded with gangs working for the Joker, the Penguin and Two-Face. At certain intervals, when Batman deciphers enough \\"challenges\\", the location of a room containing one of the Riddler's hostages is revealed, after which the Dark Knight must outwit the deadly traps within the chamber. The freed hostage then gives Batman a sequence of numbers from the Riddler, which correlates to a radio frequency that, once tuned in, will either give Batman a new location or tell him to find more trophies. After saving five hostages and completing 400 challenges, Oracle manages to discern the location of the Riddler's hideout. Once inside the Riddler's base of operations, Batman observes that the remaining hostages are trapped in a prolonged cycle of torture: they must continuously walk along a path or the explosives strapped to their heads will detonate. Batman must then avoid walking in front of each hostage until he reaches and manages to incapacitate the Riddler. The Riddler also plays a major role in the game's challenge mode, which is called \\"Riddler's Revenge\\". Various challenge maps show him having numerous henchmen working for him, including TYGER Guards, Ra's al Ghul's ninja assassins, Mr. Hammer and his twin Mr. Sickle, a Titan-empowered henchman, and even Black Mask. * The Riddler's Enigma identity is featured in the prequel game Batman: Arkham Origins (2013). Edward Nashton is described as a police consultant and apparent head of the GCPD's Cybercrime unit. Here, he has yet to take up the mantle of the Riddler and is known only as \\"Enigma\\". In the game, he has set up a series of signal jammers throughout Gotham City to disrupt the Batplane as well as Batman's own hacking transmitter. He plots to blackmail several of Gotham's most prominent citizens, in the hopes of making Gotham a better place by getting rid of those who are corrupt, although in the process risking the lives of several innocent people. Enigma also has several informants and pieces of extortion recordings scattered throughout Gotham, which Batman must uncover and decode in place of the Riddler trophies of previous games. His encounter with Batman prompts Edward to go into hiding and develop his identity as the Riddler; he hints to this as he calls Batman \\"quite the riddle\\". * In Batman: Arkham Knight (2015), during the chaos caused by the Scarecrow, the Riddler has set up several new challenges for his Riddler Trophies, some of which call on Batman to perform in the Batmobile. He captures Catwoman at one point to use as a hostage to make Batman play his game-Catwoman trapped in an old orphanage wearing an explosive collar that can only be deactivated by a series of keys that will be provided when certain riddles and challenges are solved-but Batman frees her. After solving all the riddles, the Riddler has a final showdown with Batman and Catwoman in his Riddler Mech and using his army of robots, the Riddler claiming in the aftermath that Catwoman's aid was cheating and Batman 'should' have been able to hack the robots' complex operating systems rather than just beat them up. In the prison following Scarecrow exposing Batman's true identity, the Riddler is the only one that refuses to accept that Bruce Wayne is Batman, incapable of accepting that his past theories were wrong. In the \\"Catwoman's Revenge\\" DLC, Catwoman infiltrates the Riddler's headquarters for payback after he kidnapped her, just as he is using his phone call from prison to remotely activate his army of robots. Catwoman defeats the Riddler's armed thugs and robots and transfers all his money to her bank account before leaving his factory to self-destruct. * The Riddler appears as a playable character in the mobile game Batman: Arkham Underworld, voiced again by Wally Wingert.

Riddler's dying words are \\"They broke the pact,\\" leading Batman (and others) to initially believe his partners had betrayed him. His corpse is later recovered by the Pact to create biometric keys to bypass SANCTUS security and create a usable version of the LOTUS virus. Riddler's body is later destroyed by Amanda Waller and his blood is taken by the Agency to create their own version of the virus, though the samples are ultimately destroyed by Agent Iman Avesta, much to the dismay of both Waller and Harley Quinn. Spoofs and parodies * In the Tiny Toon Adventures episode \\"Inside Plucky Duck\\", a cartoon called \\"Bat's All, Folks!\\" parodied the Riddler as the Question Mark (voiced by Charlie Adler). He attacks Bat- Duck by asking \\"How can you tell if an elephant's been in your bed?\\" Bat-Duck asks \\"African elephant or Indian?\\" to which he quotes \\"Gee, I don't know\\" and is defeated by Bat-Duck. Gogo Dodo also dresses as the Riddler (the 60's TV show variant) after quoting a famous line from Hamlet in the pilot episode \\"The Looney Beginning\\". * Frank Gorshin and Adam West parodied the 1994 film Interview with the Vampire as their (uncostumed) 1960s Batman characters in a short film for The MTV Movie Awards, with West portraying Brad Pitt's vampire (or \\"bat-man\\") and Gorshin as Christian Slater's interviewer. * Meredith Stepien played the Riddler in StarKid Productions production of Holy Musical B@man!. * An episode of Drawn Together entitled \\"Captain Girl\\" featured a villain called the Mad Libber, a parody of the Riddler mixed with Mad Libs. * An episode of \\"Badman\\", a CollegeHumor parody of \\"Batman\\", features Batman finding a kidnapped Rachel Dawes held hostage by the Riddler (redesigned to look more like the villains seen in the Nolan films). He gets frustrated with Batman's stupidity over not solving his simple riddle and tries shooting him, but one of the bullets bounces off Batman's armor and hits him. * The Riddler appears in the \\"Superhero Speed Dating\\" sketch of Movie 43, portrayed by Will Carlough. He was revealed to be at the speed dating establishment posing as Supergirl. * A box with the Riddler's question mark appears in a Garfield comic on December 12, 2010. * A brief Robot Chicken sketch features the Riddler (voiced by Patrick Warburton) at home with his family. He poses a riddle asking someone to pass the salt and his wife angrily berates him for his needless complications. In another sketch featuring the Justice League and the Legion of Doom teaming up to defeat Starro the Conqueror, the Riddler (voiced by Paul Reubens) refuses to attack until someone acknowledges his riddling, prompting the giant starfish to crush him. * In The Venture Bros. episode \\"The Better Man\\", Jefferson Twilight is shown training with cardboard cut-outs of various villains. One of those cutouts turns out to be of author Matthew Lesko. Jefferson explains that he mistook him for The Riddler because they both wear suits with question marks on them. The Alchemist then says Lesko is actually a good guy because in his books, he gives advice on how to get free money from the US government. Action figures Riddler action figure, part of the \\"Super Amigos Collection\\". * Riddler has made several appearances as an action figure as part of Kenner's Batman: The Animated Series, Legends of Batman, and Batman: Knight Force Ninjas lines; Mattel's The Batman line; and Art Asylum's minimates line. He has also been produced as a HeroClix. Five different Riddler figures were produced for the 1995 Batman Forever line, including a Target exclusive and one that says phrases from the film. * The Riddler is one of the rarest of Pacipa's Super Amigos line, the Argentinian version of Kenner's Super Powers Collection. He is a repainted Green Lantern figure that was only released in South America. He was also part of the line of action figures called the DC Comics SuperHeroes from Toy Biz. * Three versions of the Riddler have appeared in the DC Direct line, two based on his first appearance and one based on his look in the \\"Hush\\" storyline. The Japanese toy company Yamato has also produced a figure of him. * Mattel has included two versions of the character in its DC Universe toyline; one in his classic costume, and another in his current costume. * In 1974, the Mego company released two Riddler figures; one was 8\\" tall with a cloth outfit for the World's Greatest Superheroes line of toys (this figure was in production until 1979), the other was a smaller figure which was molded rubber over the wire for the Bend 'n Flex line. In 1975 and 1976, Mego also released the 8\\" tall Fist Fighting Riddler which was basically the same as the 1974 figure except it had a mechanism which allowed a child move a lever on the figure's back to make the arms swing. * Bearbrick released a DC Superpowers Riddler which was released at 2013 San Diego ComicCon (July 18‚Äì21) by Medicom Toy which was limited to only 1500. * DC Direct has released a Riddler figure in the Batman: Arkham City line. Music * During his time on the 1960s television series, Frank Gorshin recorded an album with a song titled \\"The Riddler\\", in which he sings of his obsession with puzzles. He performed a musical parody of the character on Dean Martin's variety show in 1966. * A 1966 album by The Marketts titled The Batman Theme featured a Dick Glasser instrumental song titled \\"The Riddler\\". * A song based on the character titled \\"The Riddler\\" was performed by rapper Method Man, and was featured on the Batman Forever soundtrack. * The Riddler makes an appearance in the video of the Nik Kershaw 1984 song \\"The Riddle\\". * The symphonic metal band Nightwish recorded a song called \\"The Riddler\\" on their album Oceanborn. * Composer Mohammed Fairouz wrote a piano suite based on Batman's rogues gallery.

He is noted for his investigation of highly strained and fused aromatic compounds, and was also active as an historian of chemistry. Early life, family and education Born in Accrington, Lancashire, England, on 9 March 1941, Halton was the only child of John Henry Halton and Mary (May) Halton (n√©e Robinson). He contracted bovine tuberculosis as a young child and consequently missed two years of his early education. Later he attended St Joseph's College, Blackpool, and St Joseph's Academy, Blackheath. After winning a state scholarship, Halton studied chemistry at the University of Southampton, graduating BSc(Hons) in 1963. He went on to complete a PhD supervised by Richard Cookson at the same institution in 1966. His two-part thesis was titled Part I: Addition reactions of a methyleneaziridine. Part II: Conformational aspects of cyclotriveratrylene derivatives. Halton moved to Wellington, New Zealand, in 1968, and married Margaret Leach in 1970. The couple went on to have two children. In 1980, Halton became a naturalised New Zealander. Academic and research career After two years of post-doctoral research with Merle Battiste at the University of Florida, where he worked on small ring chemistry, Halton was appointed as a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Victoria University of Wellington in 1968, eventually rising to become a full professor. When he retired in 2004, he was conferred the title of professor emeritus. Halton's research was centred on the synthesis and investigation of highly strained and fused aromatic compounds and their unstable cyclopropanated derivatives, known as cycloproparenes, which included highly strained didehydrobenzenes and some exceptionally fluorescent compounds. in 1987, Halton was conferred with the degree of Doctor of Science by Victoria University of Wellington, on the basis of his submission of 57 papers, collectively titled Studies of some strained organic molecules, published between 1971 and 1987. Halton was active in the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry (NZIC), serving as chair of the Wellington branch, editor of Chemistry in New Zealand between 2002 and 2012, and president of the NZIC from 1986 to 1987. He represented New Zealand on the organising committee of Pacifichem, the international chemical congress of Pacific basin societies, for 18 years. Later life and death Following his retirement, he pursued his interest in the history of chemistry. He wrote a history of the chemistry department at Victoria University, first published in 2012, with later editions in 2014 and 2018, and a collection of short biographies of notable chemists from Lancashire, published in 2015 as A legacy of Lancashire: its chemists, biochemists and industrialists. He also wrote an autobiography, From Coronation Street to a consummate chemist, published in 2011. Halton died in Wellington on 23 February 2019. Honours and awards The New Zealand Association of Scientists awarded Halton its Research Medal in 1974, and the Shorland Medal in 2001. In 1980, he received the ICI Medal for excellence in chemical research from the NZIC. Halton was elected a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry in 1977, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1992. In 2005, he was awarded an honorary fellowship of the NZIC.

The type species is Antarctanax shackletoni. It was a reptile around the size of an iguana.  Discovery and naming  During a paleontological expedition to the Transantarctic Mountains in 2010 and 2011, a small skeleton was discovered at the Graphite Peak. In 2019, the type species Antarctanax shackletoni was named and described by Brandon Robert Peecook, Roger Malcolm Harris Smith and Christian Alfred Sidor. The generic name combines a reference to Antarctica ‚Äî itself derived from Greek anti, \\"opposite of\\", and arktikos, \\"of the Bear\\" ‚Äî with a Greek anax, \\"ruler\\", a reference to the Archosauria, the \\"Ruling Reptiles\\". The specific name honours Ernest Shackleton, the polar explorer who named the Beardmore Glacier which runs along the Graphite Peak. The holotype, UWBM 95531, was found in a layer of the lower Fremouw Formation, which dates to the Early Triassic. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains eight vertebrae of the neck or back, ribs, the left humerus, all five metatarsals of the left foot, phalanges, among them the claws, of the left foot, and the almost complete right foot. Apart from the feet, the skeleton is largely disarticulated. It represents an adult individual.  Description  Antarctanax was about the size of an iguana, long. The describing authors indicated a unique combination of traits that in themselves are not unique. These traits prove that Antarctanax is a distinct taxon. The cervicodorsal vertebrae, those spanning the rear neck and front back, have per side a lamina centrodiapophysealis anterior, a ridge running on the front underside of the side process towards the vertebral body. The cervicodorsal vertebrae have per side a lamina prezygodiapophysealis, a ridge running from the side process to the front articulation process. The cervicodorsal vertebrae have per side a lamina postzygodiapophysealis, a ridge running from the side process to the rear articulation process. The cervicodorsal vertebrae lack a lamina centrodiapophyseal posterior, a ridge running on the rear underside of the side process towards the vertebral body. The neck vertebrae have no keels on the underside. The neck vertebrae have deep pits to the side of the base of the neural spine. The back vertebrae have deep pits to the side of the base of the neural spine. The fourth metatarsal is more than 30% longer than the third metatarsal.  Phylogeny  Antarctanax was, within the larger Archosauromorpha, placed in the Archosauriformes. A cladistic analysis showed that it had a more derived position than the Proterosuchidae. It was in a polytomy with Fugusuchus and Sarmatosuchus, all three forms being more basal than Cuyosuchus, the Erythrosuchidae and the Eucrocopoda. The derived position of Antarctanax indicates that several more basal archosauromorph groups must have ghost lineages dating back to the Late Permian.

Location  The Bambata cave is a huge archaeological cave located in the west part of the Motobo National Park and in the north side of the game park on the Kezi-Bulawayo road. The cave takes its name from the Bambata Mountain, a dome-shaped granite mountain which is located in the north-west of this region and is one of the highest hills in Western Matopos. Bambata cave is situated approximately 300 feet below the summit on the eastern side of the Bambata Hill. The cave is invisible from the surrounding valleys and the hill summit.  First excavations  In 1918, George Arnold and Neville Jones\\"Jones, Reverend Neville (archaeology, entomology)\\". S2A3 Biographical Database of Southern African Science. Retrieved September 29, 2019. started initial examinations in the cave with great difficulties. An area of 4 feet deep, 16 feet long, 6 feet wide was found at the back side of the cave and two smaller holes on the east and west sides. The surface of the cave covered with a grey ash-powder layer and the entrance was blocked by a thicket of thorns which made the inside darker. After clearing away the bushes, a more precise examination was done on the floor of the cave. Several Wilton type scrapers, 1-2 crescents in jasper and white quartz, pieces of pottery polished brown to black were found here. Wilton type scrapers and polished black and brown pottery samples were found in the top layer of the cave that required extreme caution. Traces of hyrax, antelope, and several mammals have also been found during excavations. Animal paintings on the walls prove that Bambata residents were hunters. After the digging was completed, the camp named \\"Paradise Camp\\" was established on 7 June 1929. The methodology of the excavation was conducted by Leslie Armstrong and Major T.A. The artefacts were delivered from the excavation site to the camp, in the evenings they were washed and re-grouped. About 7 hours was scheduled for working in the cave per day. Armstrong was mainly dealing with following the paintings on the wall, marking the collected artefacts and sometimes their sorting during the excavations period: ‚ÄúAfter careful consideration, I have decided to term the industry represented by the artefacts derived from the thickest deposit in the cave, amounting to over 10 feet, \\"Bambata Culture.\\"  Cultural layers  The artefacts found in the cave are categories into different cultures based on the layers discovered in Area 1 and Area 2 of Bambata cave. Area 1 has layers called Grey ash layer (surface to 6 inches), Upper cave-earth (from 6 inches to 10 feet 6 inches), 10-foot 6-inch level, Lower cave earth (13 feet 6 inches).  Area 1   Grey ash layer  Grey ash layer is characterized by the artefacts of Wilton Industry. As being close to the surface, few samples were found including microlithic scrapers, besides crescent and triangularly shaped tools, shell beads and bone equipment, small burins. Presence of pencils and small balls of hematite and red ochre shows that the inhabitants used them for painting.  Upper cave-earth  Shell beads and microlithic, as well as Wilton tools were found in this layer. The artefacts became more elementary in character and technique as it is approached the end of this layer. The artefacts in different colours, moreover, other types of raw coloring materials, such as yellow ochre, pencils, pieces of red and brown hematites and ochres, were found. It's supposed that ochres were used to paint the body and walls.  10-feet 6-inch level  The next layer is characterised by the Mousterian Industry. Tools made of igneous rock, milky quartz, chalcedony, as well as choppers, hand-axes were found in this layer.  Lower Cave-earth  This layer is full of fragile granites and pieces of milky quartz. Most of them were supposedly used as scrapers or knives. Oval tools made of semi-transparent quartz and early forms of cleavers were found here. The cleaver revealed in Bambata cave has not been noticed in the Lower Paleolithic series of Europe.  Area 2  Area 2 was detached from Area by a wall which had 12 inches thick at the surface and 24 inches at its base. Wilton level, Upper cave- earth, 12-feet level, 16-feet 6-inch level were noticed in this area. * Wilton level is more precise in Area 2 comparing with Area 1. The layer consisted of grey ash with a total thickness of 18 inches. Spalls and fragments of desquamated granite together with artefacts formed a pebble bed representing the heavy leftover from the surface eroded by wind. Camp fires were built by Wilton people upon these peddle-beds, and as a result, the older floor extended on the back side of the cave and became deeper. * Upper Cave-earth. Artefacts found here were similar to the ones found in Upper Cave-earth layer of Area 1. * 12-feet level. Mousterian industry. In the upper layer, the remnants were in the same type with the tools found in the Mousterian level of Area 1. In lower areas, brown sandy insoluble materials containing quartz and feldspar crystals, as well as fragments of white tufaceous. Wood ash or charcoal was not noticed here. * 16-feet 6-inch level. This level is characterized by Acheulean types of tools. The two-faced stone hand axes revealed here at 16-17.5 feet on the south side. Saucer shaped pocket of black loamy earth and fragments of charcoal were found in this layer.  Bambata Ware  Bambata Ware was first revealed in the Bambata cave, but it was also found at Dombozanga Rock Shelter near the Beitbridge, Tshangula Cave in the Matopo Hills and Gondongwe Cave in Chibi district. The artefacts were found among the samples of Wilton industry and Later Stone Age tools. Bambata pottery is a part of Bambata ware. The remnants of this culture and decorative stones play an important role in studying the archaeology of Zimbabwe. Though Bambata pottery itself was first recorded by Arnold and Jones in 1918 and 1919, its origins and associations started to be investigated after Jones's (1940) and Schofield's (1941) researches. Bambata pottery is associated with the Later Stone Age and the Iron Age. Pottery materials dated back 2100 B.P and known for the thinness of the samples, stamp decoration, crenellated lips and unusualness of herringbone patterns.

Richard House, also known as the Hand Building, was built as a single-family home, and later converted to office use. It is located at 505 Wildwood Avenue in Jackson, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History Hugh H. Richard was born in 1824 in County Antrim, Ireland. In 1828, his family emigrated to the United States and settled in Geneseo, New York, and in 1833 moved again to Lenawee County, Michigan, settling near Tecumseh. By 1850, Hugh Richard was making his living as a mason. In about 1869 he moved to Jackson and continued working as a mason until he retired in the late 1880s. In about 1888, he constructed a brick home for his own use. He lived there until his death in 1893. After Richard's death, the house passed on to his daughter Alice and her husband Arthur A. Bennett. Arthur A. Bennett was at the time secretary and treasurer of the Bennett Sewer Pipe Company, and later became the general manager. Bennett died in 1930, and since that time it appears that the house has been used as office space for professionals. In the 1970s the entire house was converted to office space. Description The Richard House is a 2-1/2-story, brick, gable-roof, Queen Anne house with a rectangular side-gable front section and gable-roof rear ell. It sits on a masonry foundation, and additional stone trims the brick of the main section.

Biography   Early life  Martin Donovan was born in the city of Buenos Aires as Carlos Enrique Varela Peralta Ramos. His great- great-grandfather was Patricio Peralta Ramos, founder of the city of Mar del Plata. He was also the eldest of seven brothers and one sister, and viewed as the \\"strange one of the family\\" since the very beginning. He connected with movies and the theater since he was 6 or 7 years old and he voraciously read everything. His passion for films was shown, for instance, when he became desperate to see A Streetcar Named Desire. The young Martin would cry: \\"Why can't I see A Streetcar Named Desire?!\\", to which his mother would reply: \\"Because you're 8! Go wash your hands and come to the table!\\". In 1961, at the age of 11, he wrote a letter to renowned filmmaker Luchino Visconti (addressing the envelope as \\"Luchino Visconti, Italy, Europe\\"). Visconti got the letter and replied; 8 years later Martin Donovan will be at his side as his assistant. In 1963 he was sent to boarding school at Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepci√≥n in Santa Fe Province, where Eduardo Peralta Ramos SJ, Martin's mother's elder brother, was a teacher and the spiritual father of Jorge Bergoglio, known today as Pope Francis. Donovan went back home in 1964, and a couple of months later he escaped his parents‚Äô home through a window, leaving a letter to his mother, which read: \\"Don't cry mama, I need to find myself...\\". He soon became a runaway in Buenos Aires during summer, with only his maternal grandmother, Celia Lertora de Peralta Ramos -whom Martin called \\"Mamama\\"-, as his accomplice. Those summer months in Buenos Aires while the police was searching all over for him became a fundamental period in his life.  Career  Donovan began his career acting in Italian films, such as Fellini's Satyricon (1969), and assisted Luchino Visconti in several films. After traveling to England in the mid-60's he joined a theater company called Nuvact Studio International and collaborated with other directors such as Peter Brook, John Schlesinger and Vittorio De Sica. At the same time, Donovan consistently participated as a screenwriter and a story/script consultant in many British and American TV series. His first film as a director, State of Wonder (1984), was featured in the Official Selection at the Berlin Film Festival of that same year.BERLIN 1984 ‚Äì THE 34TH BERLINALE FILMFESTSPIELE: Zoo Parade, by Harlan Kennedy American Cinema Papers Donovan's second work as a director, Apartment Zero (1989), a British-Argentine coproduction, was entirely filmed in Buenos Aires and features Hart Bochner and a (at the time) relatively unknown Colin Firth in one of his first starring roles, together with a mostly Argentine cast. It is considered by some reviewers as a complex suspense story with psychodrama elements, in the tradition of Joseph Losey and Roman Polanski's movies. The film has gained a strong cult following over the years. His most important work in Hollywood was the screenplay for the classic black comedy Death Becomes Her (1992), which was directed by Robert Zemeckis and starred Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. His penultimate directorial effort to date is Somebody Is Waiting (1996) -which he also wrote-, a drama starring Gabriel Byrne, Nastassja Kinski and Johnny Whitworth. Donovan continues working in the film industry, dabbling occasionally as an actor, and writing screenplays to this day.

Moreover, a molecular analysis of the tribe Osmiini concluded similarly that Ochreriades is only distantly related to other osmiines.Praz C.J., M√ºller A., Danforth B.N., Griswold T.L., Widmer A., Dorn S. 2008. Phylogeny and biogeography of bees of the tribe Osmiini (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 49: 185-197. It is possible to relate Ochreriades to other osmiines through the similar manifestation of the slender and elongate shape of its body, which is reminiscent of that of the osmiine genera Chelostoma and Heriades. Like Chelostoma and Heriades, Ochreriades \\"exhibits a long narrow abdomen; in contrast to these two genera, however, Ochreriades also exhibits an elongate thorax\\". The likely explanation for the slender, elongate body shape of Ochreriades is an adaptation to nesting in narrow openings, such as abandoned insect burrows or plant stems.M√ºller A. 1996.

The design featured gasket glazing which distinguished it from the contemporary high-floor Duple Caribbean and semi-integral Duple Calypso (both of which had bonded glazing). Quad headlamps and a small chrome grille were shared with the Caribbean, although the Calypso's twin headlamps and wider grille could be specified as an option. At the end of 1984 the Laser range was given a facelift and renamed the Laser 2. The main differences were a switch to bonded glazing and a revised front with twin headlamps and plastic grille, again shared with the contemporary Caribbean II. Additionally, the Laser 2 became available on mid-engined DAF chassis. The Laser Express and Laser 2 Express were dual-purpose versions with bus-type entrance door and other modifications intended for use on express and interurban services. These were eligible for the British Government's New Bus Grant until this subsidy on new buses was terminated in 1984. Replacement At the end of 1985 the new Duple 320 and 340 were launched as replacements for the Laser and Caribbean ranges respectively.

Born as Clifford Groocock Hincks, he was brought up as a Methodist, and from 1917 was a lay preacher. By 1921 he was living in Hinckley in Leicestershire, and working as a hosiery hand. That year, he dropped his surname, and became known as \\"Clifford Groocock Groocock\\". He became active in the Hinckley and District Hosiery Union, and in 1930 he was elected as its general secretary. Under Groocock's leadership, the Hinckley union grew, with membership reaching 6,000 by 1939. However, during World War II this fell back to 4,000 members, and he learned that the Transport and General Workers' Union and the National Union of General and Municipal Workers were proposing to start recruiting hosiery workers in the East Midlands. As a result, he came to support Horace Moulden's proposal that the various local hosiery unions should merge and form a national union. In 1945, Groocock took his union into the new National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers, and he became its first general secretary. Despite the title, this post was only that of second-in-command, with Moulden as general president being its most prominent figure. Groocock also remained leader of the new union's Hinckley section. Like Moulden, Groocock saw himself as a social democrat, favouring good relationships with employers and minimising industrial action. The union grew as a national force, and Groocock retired in 1960.

Initially a music critic, Betrock founded the influential New York Rocker magazine in 1976 and the publishing house Shake Books in 1979. He has written and edited several books, including the critically acclaimed Girl Groups: The Story of a Sound. He produced Blondie's first demos in 1975 and launched the short-lived record label Shake Records. He has produced and/or released music by such artists as Marshall Crenshaw, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, the dB's and the Smithereens. Early career A native of Queens, New York City, Betrock went to Newtown High School in Queens and attended Queens College. He founded the fanzine JAMZ as an undergrad in 1971, which led to Rock Marketplace in 1973. The magazine united record collectors nationwide in the search for obscure releases and included articles that established catalog numbers and release dates. Betrock himself was a passionate record collector with encyclopedic musical knowledge and a passion for obscure 1960s and 1970s garage rock singles. He became fascinated with rock music during the rise of the British Invasion and frequently travelled to England in search for rare albums and singles. \\"I'd hear a record on radio and try to seek it out, but it was very hard to find if it wasn't in the top 30,\\" he said in a 1972 interview in The New York Times. During this period Betrock also wrote for a number of music magazines, such as Phonograph Record, ZigZag and Hit Parader, as well as local newspaper SoHo Weekly News. From the mid-1970s onward, he compiled various compilation albums for labels such as Pye and Rhino, as well as writing liner notes.Alan Betrock on Discogs - Acting, Literary & Spoken. Discogs.com. Retrieved on 19 February 2019. Later period Not long after its December 1973 opening, Betrock found his way to gigs at CBGB in Manhattan's East Village. Witnessing the emergence of bands like Television, the Ramones and Talking Heads, he immersed himself completely in the new underground music scene. In 1975, Betrock financed and produced a demo for the then-unknown Blondie, whom he originally intended to manage. However, a combination of his other interests and lack of confidence in their musical abilities ended his involvement with the band. Betrock chose instead to manage another New York band, the Marbles. In February 1976, Betrock launched the influential New York Rocker magazine, chronicling the rising punk rock scene and other musical trends in the late 1970s. According to Andy Schwartz, New York Rocker's publisher and editor from 1978-1983, the magazine was a \\"visionary move, the product of Betrock‚Äôs realization that the music rising from a run-down Bowery bar deserved its own magazine - one with its own style of photography and graphic design, one that would blend a fan‚Äôs enthusiasm with an educated critical eye. Through the pages of New York Rocker, Alan Betrock defined the new rock and roll\\". A conceptualist, Betrock created board game centerfolds (‚ÄúHow to Become a New York Rock Star‚Äù) and imaginary 45 rpm picture sleeves for ‚Äúsingles we‚Äôd like to see.‚Äù The magazine also collaborated with fashion designer Anna Sui, photographers Steven Meisel and Roberta Bayley, and artist Duncan Hannah, among many others. During this time he also worked as the East Coast editor for Bomp! magazine. After 11 issues, Betrock left New York Rocker in late 1977. \\"Alan was one of those people who plunged himself into something with tremendous enthusiasm and dedication, and when he was done with it, he was done,\\" remembered Andy Schwartz. Meanwhile, he amassed a collection of miscellaneous American pop memorabilia. The archives became the source for several books on American magazines and their history. Mostly published on his own Shake Books during the 1980s and 1990s, Betrock wrote and edited books on, among other things, teenage exploitation films, rock and scandal magazines, and the history of the pinup. His 1982 book, Girl Groups: The Story of a Sound, which spawned a documentary film in 1983, was lauded by the critic Robert Palmer in The New York Times as \\"everything a rock 'n' roll genre study should be.\\" Music production His short-lived Shake Records (1979-1981) was the first to release recordings by the dB's, the Cosmopolitans and Marshall Crenshaw. Later non-Shake Betrock productions included Richard Hell and the Voidoids‚Äô Destiny Street (1982) and the Smithereens‚Äô Beauty and Sadness EP (1983). In 1989, Betrock began working on a recording project with Ronnie Spector. A planned album never materialized, but five tracks were eventually released on the EP Something's Gonna Happen in 2003. Death Betrock died of cancer at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx, New York City on April 9, 2000, aged 49. He was diagnosed less than two months before his death. Lenny Kaye, longtime guitarist with Patti Smith, told MTV: \\"A good man, and a record/pop culture collector of the highest order. I always admired his thoroughness, in whatever field he touched.\\" In 2013, Marshall Crenshaw told Songfacts: \\"He launched my career, and I badly regret that he and I didn't do more stuff together. That was one of my bad blunders.\\" Bibliography * Rock 'N' Roll Movie Posters (Shake Books, 1979) * Girl Groups: The Story of a Sound (Delilah Books, 1982) * The I Was a Teenage Juvenile Delinquent Rock'N'Roll Horror Beach Party Movie Book: A Complete Guide to the Teen Exploitation Film, 1954-1969 (St. Martin's Press, 1986) * The Personality Index to Hollywood Scandal Magazines, 1952-1966 (Shake Books, 1988) * The Best of James Dean in the \\"Scandal Magazines\\" 1955-1958 (Shake Books, 1988) * Cult Exploitation Movie Posters, 1940-1973 (Shake Books, 1989) * The Tabloid Poster Book, 1959-'69 - The Wildest Wallpaper You've Ever Seen (Shake Books, 1989) * Unseen America: The Greatest Cult Exploitation Magazines, 1950-1966 (Shake Books, 1990) * Hitsville: The 100 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Magazines, 1954-1968 (Shake Books, 1991) * From Exploitation to Sexploitation: Four Decades of Adult Film Posters, 1930s-1960s (Shake Books, 1992) * Jayne Mansfield Vs.

It is 902 m from Schoppershof underground station and 835 m from Herrnh√ºtte underground station. The station is connected to R√∂thenbach by a sharp track change in the direction of R√∂thenbach and a parking and sweeping facility in the direction of the airport up to Herrnh√ºtte underground station. The Nordostbahnhof was opened on 1 February 1908 as part of the Gr√§fenbergbahn. According to earlier plans, the station was to be called Leipziger Platz. Location The station is located in Nuremberg's Nordostbahnhof district and extends in a north-south direction under Leipziger Platz between Mommsenstrasse and Kieslingstrasse. From both platform heads, stairways lead to a distribution floor spanning the entire platform area. From the south end of the distribution floor, stairways lead to the south side of Leipziger Platz, Elbinger Stra√üe and Mommsenstra√üe, partly as ramps. From the north end of the distribution floor, staircases lead directly to Leipziger Platz and the bus station, to the north side of Kieslingstrasse via a ramp to N√ºrnberg Nordost station and under the Nuremberg Ring Railway to Bessemerstrasse. An elevator connects the platform level with the distribution floor and Leipziger Platz. Building and architecture The station building is 160 m long, 17 m wide and 11 m deep. Construction work began on 1 June 1992 and was carried out using the open method with Berlin shoring (Berliner Verbau). When Leipziger Platz was completed, there should have been a four- storey office building above the underground station. The northern part of the station was left open at the top and protected against wind and weather by an easily removable temporary roof construction. To date, the plans have not been implemented in this form, so that the provisional roof construction is still above the open station. The design of the station was entrusted to Johannes Peter H√∂lzinger, who at the time was professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg. He designed red colour ribbons which run vertically in the middle of the platform, inclined towards the end of the platform. These are intended to symbolise standstill, acceleration and braking of underground trains.

Harvey 605 F.2d 330 (7th Cir. 1979) was a landmark decision on judicial immunity, brought under the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983). In it, the United States court of appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that intentional acts of public defamation inspired by racial prejudice are not judicial functions, thus establishing that neither judicial or prosecutorial immunity protects a judge who uses the power of their state office to engage in such acts. It has been cited as the first case in the United States where a sitting court judge was sued and lost in a civil action. As decision of the Seventh Circuit, the case is binding precedent in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and has been used as persuasive authority in other appellate and district courts.See, ; ; ;  Background  In 1967 Sylvester Harris was recruited by the mayor of Racine, Wisconsin to serve as head of the Community Relations Division within the city's Police Department. Though racism was highly prevalent within the police force, Harris had the initial support of police chief and, in 1973 became the first African-American lieutenant in city history. Though largely intended as a public relations post, Harris used his role in the department to aggressively investigate police misconduct, especially against minorities; in many cases, often forwarding complaints of racism (which were routinely ignored by the department) directly to the district attorney's office. Harris' insistence on dealing directly with complaints of racism by police officers earned him a reputation as a troublemaker from fellow officers, the police union, and the district attorney, and all filed numerous complaints against Harris to the police chief. In January 1974, Harris was driving home from a nighttime basketball game in civilian attire, when he noticed traffic was stopped by three men who were standing in the street. Harris got out of his vehicle and identified himself as a police officer, to which one of the men (later identified as Dale Vorlob) allegedly replied \\"you ain't shit nigger\\" and held a gun to Harris' face. On pulling the trigger, the gun failed to discharge. In his account, Harris says that he attempted to grab the gun from Vorlob, but was knocked to the ground. Eventually Harris was able to draw his sidearm, and kept the three men against a wall until on-duty officers arrived to arrest them. Several days later, Vorlob (who was on parole for multiple felonies) met with the district attorney. Vorlob claimed to the D.A. that Harris had come to his home two days after the street incident, beat him with a pistol, and threatened his life. Harris denied the claim, and Vorlob later publicly changed his mind after a chance encounter with Harris during a traffic stop. Despite not having a case, the D.A. insisted on pursuing the charges against Harris. Then, in the time leading up to the trial, a judge by the name of Richard G. Harvey, began routinely engaging in public acts intended to harm the credibility of Harris, including reading warrants for Harris' arrest on air at radio stations, writing malicious stories about Harris for local newspapers (often printed across the paper's front page), presiding over secretive \\"John Doe\\" hearings, and threatening witnesses and other Judges if they would not testify against Harris. These events eventually led to Harris and his attorney Paul Gossins, to file a lawsuit against Judge Harvey and the D.A.  Court trials  The district court trial hinged upon several questions, including whether Harvey was protected by judicial immunity, whether he was acting under color of law, and whether the claims against him were cognizable under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The proceedings included evidence from the incident with Vorlob, the ensuing D.A. lawsuit, and over 200 instances of malicious public actions Judge Harvey had made against Harris after indicting him in the Vorlob case. During the proceedings, Judge Harvey was asked about racial commentary he had made in public, specifically in his calling for the removal of that \\"black bastard\\" and \\"goddamned nigger\\" (referring to Harris) from the police force. Harvey responded in testimony, that he affirmed making the comments, but that they were not racial. The question to the jury was whether Judge Harvey undertook non-judicial acts which were motivated by racial bias and had inflicted injury on Harris. The case ended with an all- white jury making a judgement in favor of Harris. The jury stated that the acts of Judge Harvey were racially motivated, that Harris was had been inflicted injury to his reputation in the community and ability to continue working in the police department, and that the acts perpetrated against him were both racially motivated, and had caused the plaintiff humiliation, embarrassment, and mental distress. The jury awarded Harris what was at the time an unusually large judgement of $260,000 (approx. $1,000,000 in 2018 dollars). The settlement was upheld by the United States Court of appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which stated that Judge Harvey was not protected by judicial immunity due to his acts 1) taking place outside the courtroom, and 2) not being acts normally performed by a judge. The case has been cited as the first in the United States where a sitting court judge was sued and lost in a civil action. As decision of the Seventh Circuit, the case is binding precedent in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and has been used as persuasive authority in other appellate and district courts.

History  Stilbaai was declared a marine protected area in 2008. It is adjacent to the terrestrial Geelkrans Nature Reserve, which helps ensure that the coastal areas are well protected. The MPA is intended to help recovery of over-exploited reef line fish, to reduce habitat degradation to preserve archaeologically and culturally important fish traps. The Stilbaai Marine Protected Area was proclaimed on 17 October 2008 in Government Notice No. 31517. The associated regulations regarding management were published in Government Notice No. 31516.  Purpose  A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\".  Extent  The MPA protects of coastline, of the Goukou estuary, and of ocean.  Boundaries  The MPA is between Noordkapperspunt and Rietvleivywers, and includes the estuary of the Goukou River for upstream. The seaward boundaries are from S34¬∞23.964‚Ä≤, E021¬∞24.800‚Ä≤ at Noordkapperspunt to S34¬∞23.964‚Ä≤, E021¬∞30.976‚Ä≤ to S34¬∞21.676‚Ä≤, E021¬∞30.976' at Rietvleivywers. The shoreline boundary follows the high-water mark from Noordkapperspunt through the harbour, along the western shore of the estuary to 34¬∞17.830‚Ä≤ 021¬∞18.620, and back along the eastern shore to the mouth and from there to Rietvleivywers.  Zonation  There are three restricted zones in the MPA: *The Geelkrans restricted zone is the part of the MPA east of E021¬∞27.737', adjacent to the Geelkrans Nature Reserve and Rietvleivywers. *The Skulpiesbaai restricted zone is the sea part of the MPA west of E021¬∞24.970¬∞ *The Goukou estuarine restricted zone is from S34¬∞20.459‚Ä≤, E021¬∞24.198‚Ä≤ to S34¬∞17.830‚Ä≤, E021¬∞18.620‚Ä≤ The rest of the MPA is a controlled zone.  Management  The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, CapeNature, which manages the MPA with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Use   Activities requiring a permit   Fishing  Fishing is allowed in controlled areas subject to a permit, but it is banned in Geelkrans, Skulpiesbaai and Goukou estuary.  Scuba diving  Recreational scuba diving is authorised by permits issued under Section 43 of the Marine Living Resources Act. A business will require a scuba diving business permit to operate within MPA.  Geography  The coastal area of Stilbaai lies south of the Southern Langeberg mountains, which are part of the Cape Fold Belt. The exposed geology is sediments of the Table Mountain Sandstone group and occasional outcrops of the older Malmesbury group. The drainage of these mountains includes the Goukou River and its estuary, which is in the MPA. The climate of the region is in the transition zone between winter and year-round rainfall. Summer rain is orographic, with onshore south- easterly winds meeting the mountains. Winter rain is associated with sub- antarctic cold fronts and westerly winds. About rain falls mostly in spring and autumn. Temperatures range between in winter and in summer. During easterly winds coastal sea temperatures decrease, and increase during westerly winds as warmer offshore water is moved towards the coast.  Climate   Seasonal variations in sea conditions   Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Stilbaai Marine Protected Area is in the Agulhas ecoregion (describe position, biodiversity and endemism of the region) The MPA is in the warm temperate Agulhas ecoregion to the east of Cape Point which extends eastwards to the Mbashe River. There are a large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. This is a high biodiversity area, and has the coastal habitats include sandy beaches, rocky shores, dunes, coastal fynbos, salt-marshes, rocky reefs and estuarine reeds. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. There are no significant estuarine habitats in the MPA. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. Four littoral zones and their associated group of biota are present on the rocky shores. The Littorina zone its sea snails; the Upper Balanoid zone with winkles and limpets; lower Balanoid zone with brown mussels, coralline algae zoanthids at mid-tide level and the infratidal zone with anemones, sea urchins and starfish. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. Kelp forests Kelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo Ecklonia maxima grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer at or just below the surface, depending on the tide. The shorter Split-fan kelp Laminaria pallida grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply. The estuary The Goukou Estuary is one of the few permanently open estuaries on the southern coast, but the freshwater supply is very variable and progressively being reduced by upstream usage. The topography is constantly being altered by tides, wave action and changing river flow. After heavy rain the estuary is a strongly flowing muddy river, and when flow drops, sandbanks form at the river mouth. Eelgrass, and Zostera beds occur in the lower reaches of the estuary.

If looking at the system parallel to the mirror surfaces, where only the edges of the mirrors remain visible, the middle mirror and the front and back mirror look like the backbone and legs of a capital-K; this illustrates the origin of the name.  Beam Rotation  The principal use of the element is to rotate a beam that hits the first mirror on some optical axis, hits the middle and exit mirror, and leaves the system on the same principal axis. A frequent implementation occurs in the derotation stages of optical telescopes where a beam angle implied by the optical axis of the telescope is undone to keep its orientation aligned with some downstream optics. Because there is an odd number of mirrors, the overall effect also includes a flip of the image. The design refers to a nominal zero reference angle of the motor axis, where the first mirror deflects the beam upward to the middle mirror, that one deflects the beam downward to the last mirror. The picture sketches the three mirrors outlined by magenta quadrangles, three colored rays entering from the right, an exit pupil as a green canvas, and where the rays end up in the exit pupil.

It was originally built as a private house at a different location, and was moved to the present location in 1998. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History In the 1880s, interest in recreational activities was on the rise nationally, and Clark Lake began to be a destination for families from Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. This tourist base increased in 1896, when a railroad line was laid through the area, connecting Clark Lake to Jackson and to the rest of the nation. The visitors camped on the shores of the lake, stayed on one of the hotels that had been built in the area, of constricted their own cottages. One of the families which began visiting the area was that of Benjamin Graziani, a well-known lawyer and Kentucky State Senator. The Graziani family first came to Clark Lake in 1896, staying at a small hotel. Graziani decided to build his own cottage, and in 1897 purchased some property on the north side of the lake, at what is now 6740 Kentucky Avenue. The property already had three small cottages on it, and Graziani constructed an additional large, two-story, frame cottage, which was completed in 1899. He referred to the cottage as the \\"Kentucky Homestead.\\" The cottage was positioned in such a way as to be prominently visible from different parts of the lake, and became a local landmark. The Grazianis added five more small cottages and began renting them out, helping to develop the area as a vacation spot. Benjamin Graziani continued to use the cottage until his death in 1923, and his widow, Eliza, summered there until her death in 1933. In 1937, the family rented the cottage to the Clark Lake Yacht Club. After World War II, Laura Graziani Solar, one of Benjamin Graziani's daughters, purchased the cottage. Laura removed the porches that had originally encircled the house. The house remained in the Graziani family until 1986. In 1997, the owners offered the house to the Clark Lake community. It was moved by barge across the lake to the Clark Lake County Park. The house was restored, including the reconstruction of the two-story porches originally included on the house. It opened in 1998 as a community center. The facility is open to the public, and available for rent. Description The Clark Lake Community Center is a 2-story, rectangular- shaped cottage with a gable roof. It is three bays wide, and covered with clapboard siding. The roof has asphalt shingles. Corner posts run down the corners of the house, and a frieze board with crown molding runs along the eaves. A two-story, wraparound porch encircles the building. There are four entrances to the cottage: a main central entrance, and three pairs of 15-light French doors: one on one side and two on the opposite. The windows are primarily 1/1 double-hung or single-sash units, with two or three such windows on each floor of all sides of the house.

History In the early 1980s the British coach market underwent considerable change, putting pressure on the established British coachbuilding firms which had previously dominated the market. In the 1970s the great majority of coaches sold in the UK had comprised a British-built chassis with separately assembled bodywork by one of the two dominant domestic coachbuilders, Duple and Plaxton. The highest sales volumes were achieved by lightweight chassis such as the Bedford Y series and Ford R series, and even imported chassis such as the Volvo B58 usually carried Duple or Plaxton coachwork. However, the 1980s saw a move away from lightweights towards heavier and more sophisticated designs, increasingly supplied by foreign chassis and bodywork manufacturers. Some of the foreign coaches now selling in Britain were of integral construction, and Duple wished to produce an integral design of its own to compete more effectively with these. The first attempts were a pair of prototypes built in 1983, one of which was a semi-integral variant of the Duple Caribbean body built on German Auw√§rter Neoplan N716 running gear, which remained a one-off. The other prototype employed Dutch BOVA running gear within a unique style of semi- integral body known as the Duple Calypso, and a further 50 production vehicles of this type were built for the 1984 season. The styling of the Calypso was a hybrid of the contemporary Duple Laser and Caribbean coach bodies which were produced in larger numbers. It was of intermediate height, being closer in height to the Laser but featuring bonded glazing like the Caribbean. However, while the Calypso had twin headlamps and a wide grille, most contemporary Laser and Caribbean bodies had quad headlamps and a small chrome grille (although the Calypso headlights/grille could be specified as an option). In June 1983 Duple had been sold to the Hestair Group, which had previously acquired the British chassis manufacturer Dennis Brothers of Guildford. Duple was renamed Hestair Duple, and rather than persisting with semi-integrals built on third party running gear it was decided to develop a fully integral coach with running units from sister company Hestair Dennis. As a result the contract with BOVA was not renewed after the 1984 season and instead the fully integral Duple 425 was developed as a replacement for the Calypso.

Smith worked as a printers' assistant for various magazines and newspapers. He joined the Printers' Labourers' Union, and became Father of the Chapel firstly at The Field, then at Queen, and finally at the Daily Mail. In 1897, he became the chair of the union, and argued for it to change its name to reflect the fact that most of its members were skilled workers who would not generally be regarded as labourers. This was approved, and at the start of 1899 the union was renamed as the \\"Operative Printers' Assistants Union\\". In 1897, Michael Vaughan was elected as general secretary of the union, but in 1898 he permitted a lapsed member of the society to remain on the ballot to replace Smith as the union's chair. The union's executive viewed this as dereliction of duty, and removed him from office. Smith was appointed as acting general secretary, and he then beat James Keep by 924 votes to 147 in an election, to win the position on a permanent basis. As leader of the union, Smith focused on centralising its organisation and finances. He transferred its banking to the London Trading Bank, and was able to employ a clerk to assist him. He affiliated the union with the London Printing and Kindred Trades Federation in 1901, and the following year, he represented it at the refounding of the national Printing and Kindred Trades Federation. The union only operated in London until 1904, but Smith then toured the country, establishing new branches in Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester and Reading. In 1907 he moved the union's offices to Caxton House on Blackfriars Road, and he also established a superannuation scheme for members. He kept the union out of party politics, and personally generally identified with the Liberal-Labour tradition. In the second half of 1908, the union had to make numerous unexpected welfare payments to members. This led to a financial crisis, and Smith retired abruptly, to be replaced by George Isaacs. Smith moved to Canada, but the union remained appreciative of his service. When he visited London in 1925, the union sent him a formal letter greeting him and wishing him well.

Bolton (died 1947) was a British trade union official who also served on the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. Bolton was born in Birmingham, but brought up in London. While he was named \\"Hugh\\", throughout his life, his close friends called him Ben Bolton. He became a telephone engineer, and joined the London West branch of the Electrical Trades Union. By 1914, he was serving on the union's London District Committee, but was expelled from the union in 1915 along with most of the committee's members, for sending circulars to union members without the permission of the national executive. Bolton was soon readmitted to the union, and by 1919 he was a member of its executive committee. On the committee, he was known as a supporter of syndicalism, who often worked closely with Jock Muir. He resigned from the executive after a strike for shorter hours which he supported was ended by a vote of all the members, but he personally retained much support from members, and was persuaded to rescind his resignation. In 1925, Bolton was elected as the union's full-time national organiser. He focused on recruitment, and his organising trips to the West Country in 1927, which succeeded in greatly increasing membership in Plymouth, were held up as an example to the whole union. Bolton stood to become general secretary of the union in 1941, but took third place behind Ernest Bussey and Frank Foulkes, ahead of Walter Stevens and Paul McArdle. When Bussey won the run-off election, Bolton stood for the vacant position of general president, defeating Stevens by 12,854 votes to 8,772. He was the first person to hold the post on a full-time basis. His opponents claimed that he had underestimated his age by one year, in order to qualify to run in the election, but this was never proven. As general president, Bolton began suffering from poor health. He was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1944, but was unable to attend any meetings, due to his health. He retired in late 1945, shortly after the end of World War II. He died two years later.

In New South Wales, there is a minimum recreational size limit of 90 mm orbital carpace length for any spiny crayfish.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a crossover fighting video game for the Nintendo Switch. Players control one of over 80 characters drawn from Nintendo and third-party game franchises, and try to knock their opponents out of an arena. Each player has a percentage meter which rises when they take damage; characters become easier to knock into the air or out of bounds as the percentage increases. Games in the Super Smash Bros. franchise have been played competitively since the early 2000s, but the inclusion of Super Smash Bros. Melee at the 2013 edition of Evolution Championship Series (Evo), a major multi-game tournament, was seen as a turning point; after Evo 2013, competitive Smash saw an increase in tournaments, media coverage, and attention from Nintendo. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the fifth officially released Smash Bros. title; all five have been played competitively, as has a fan-made mod of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Project M. Many of the top-ranked Ultimate players were highly ranked in previous Smash Bros. titles. Ultimate was released on December 7, 2018, to critical acclaim, and broke sales records in the United States and Europe en route to becoming the best-selling fighting game of all time. The release of Ultimate saw an increase in the number of people entering and watching tournaments, leading to an increase in available prize money compared to the previous title, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. However, unlike many other developers, Nintendo does not contribute funds to tournament prize pools. As a result, the prize pools for Ultimate are still significantly smaller than those of other fighting games. The Ultimate tournament at Evo 2019 had just over 3,500 entrants, which made it the largest offline tournament held in Smash Bros. franchise history. However, its prize pool of $35,300 - $10 from each player's registration fee - was smaller than that of Street Fighter V, which had only 1,951 entrants, but whose developer Capcom contributed $50,000 to the prize pool. Additionally, Japanese law significantly limits cash prizes for esports events held in that country. Some Japanese tournaments use legal loopholes to provide cash prizes, while others offer non-cash prizes, including tickets for players to attend American tournaments. Nintendo received widespread criticism after Ultimate was the only game at Evo Japan 2020 not to offer a cash prize. While other games' developers joined the Japan Esports Union, allowing them to offer prizes, Nintendo did not, and instead awarded the winner a Switch controller emblazoned with a gold Smash Bros. logo. In a January 2020 interview, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa indicated that the company did not intend to support esports, stating that the company's focus was on inclusiveness, and their ability to create games that a large number of people want to play, without the need for prize money, was one of Nintendo's strengths. Smash Bros. tournaments are generally seeded so that the best players do not face off against each other until the later stages of a tournament. The most authoritative ranking of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate players is the Panda Global Rankings Ultimate (PGRU). The PGRU groups tournaments into one of four tiers - S, A, B, and C - based on the number of entrants, with S being the most prestigious tier and C the least. Tournaments can also qualify for higher tiers by having a large number of highly ranked players, even if the overall number of entrants is lower. Tournaments held outside of the United States require fewer entrants to qualify for higher tiers, owing to their smaller competitive communities. S-tier and A-tier events are frequently called \\"majors\\", with S-tier tournaments sometimes called \\"supermajors\\". This list contains all PGRU majors ‚Äì S- and A-tier events ‚Äì from the release of Ultimate through the present.

It is served by the Nuremberg suburban train line . History The Dutzendteich station was opened on 1 December 1871 by the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company (Actiengesellschaft der bayerischen Ostbahnen) together with the Nuremberg-Neumarkt section of today's Nuremberg‚ÄìRegensburg railway. The first station on the single-track line had three platform tracks, and in the northern area an outdoor loading track with scales, which led as siding to the Maschinenfabrik Sp√§th, and a track with ramp. The first station building was dominated by a waiting hall open to the track side, at the northern end of which there was a waiting room of 3rd class and at the southern end a waiting room of 1st and 2nd class. On the street side there was a massive two-storey building with a passageway and service rooms. The surroundings of the railway station were especially designed in a horticultural way and adapted to the park facilities at the number ponds. With the double-track extension of the main line in 1895 and the extension to the junction station by the Nuremberg Ring Railway branches in the direction of Rangierbahnhof (1898) or M√∂geldorf / N√ºrnberg-Ost (1900), as well as the construction of additional freight tracks, the area of the railway station continued to grow. Former reception building, today a restaurant The first major reconstruction was carried out from 14 March to 5 September 1934, in the course of the Reichsparteitag which had been taking place since 1933, and comprised the construction of a 400-metre-long house and central platform, two underpasses (the eastern one with direct access to the Zeppelin grandstand), as well as the reception building, now under a preservation order,Der Bahnhof N√ºrnberg-Dutzendteich in der Denkmalliste des Bayerischen Landesamtes f√ºr Denkmalpflege according to plans by Fritz Limpert, for which the first reception building was demolished. This was intended to better cope with the mass rush during the Reichsparteitag. The second reconstruction between 1989 and 1992 took place in connection with the construction work for the second Nuremberg S-Bahn line to Altdorf, as the construction plans included the relocation of the passenger railway station to the north-west, which was unfavourably located in terms of traffic, to the overpass over the southern ring (S√ºdring). The and the new Nuremberg- Dutzendteich S-Bahn station went into operation on 22 November 1992, the old unused platforms were removed in the course of the following years and the former reception building was converted into a restaurant. According to a research conducted by Bayerischer Rundfunk in 2016, Deutsche Bahn plans to discontinue operation of the \\"Nuernberg-Dutzendtch\\" freight transport station (Gvst No. 222075).

Location and contents The address of the museum is Avenida del Doctor Gu√†rdia, s/n, Mah√≥n. The museum's collection is formed by artifacts which were held in the previous museum, from archaeological excavations conducted in the past few years and deposits and donations from private people and several institutions. The permanent exhibition was completely renovated during 2017-2018 and reopened to visitors in July 2018. Nowadays the museum also holds temporary exhibitions on the ground floor. Museo de Menorca is the leading institution in the diffusion of Menorca's heritage and cultural landscape and has fostered an important task in the research of the Prehistory of the island. History The preceding museum was Museo Municipal de Mah√≥n (Municipal Museum of Mah√≥n), which was opened in November 4, 1889 in the old building of Principal de Guardia, opposite the town hall. Its promoter was Joan Segu√≠ Rodr√≠guez and its initial collection consisted of private donations. The first artifacts, which were fragments of Roman tombs from Mah√≥n, were donated by Pere Monjo Monjo, who was the museum's curator. In 1890, after the death of the founder of the museum, the city council appointed the staff meeting of the high school as curators of the collection. In 1898 Francesc Hern√°ndez Sanz, teacher of the high school, was in charge of consolidating the curacy of the collection. In 1906, the museum collection was moved to Museo del Ateneo, where it stayed until 1944, when they became part of the recently inaugurated Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes (Provincial Museum of Fine Arts), organized by F√©lix Merino and M. Llu√Øsa Serra. Mah√≥n City Council ceded Can Mercadal palace, home to the House of Culture and currently the public library, where the new museum was placed in November 1948. Moreover, Ateneo de Mah√≥n donated artifacts which, along those from the Commission of Excavations, Sub-commission of Monuments and others from private collections, increased the Museum collection a great deal. From 1953 to 1967, under the direction of M. Llu√Øsa Serra, the collection continued increasing with the acquisition of artwork and donations from Menorcan painters, and important tasks of documentation and diffusion were carried out too. In this period the museum also kept archaeological materials from important sites that were under research in that time, such as Naveta d'Es Tudons, Rafal Rub√≠ naveta, the settlement of Talat√≠ de Dalt, Forn√†s de Torell√≥ and Illa del Rey basilicas, among others. In 1975, under the name of Museu de Menorca, it was included in the National Board of Museums. However, the building had structural problems that caused its closure. Five years later, in 1980, a building belonging to Mah√≥n city council was donated to the State, which was the old Franciscan convent, which became the new and permanent home to the museum. In 1984, the government of the Balearic Islands started managing the museum. In 1986 part of the refurbished building reopened for the public. The restoration of the cloister of Saint Francis gave new items to the museum: 17th and 18th century pottery and 18th and 19th century multi-coloured tiles. Temporary rooms were open to the public in 1995 and the permanent rooms did so three years later, when the new headquarters of the museum were officially opened. The museum's collection has grown over the years thanks to the work carried out by institutions such as Boston University, the University of Cagliari and the University of the Balearic Islands, as well as thanks the work performed by several research teams formed by numerous archaeologists. Also, the artefacts found by Margaret Murray during her excavations in the 1930s were recovered from Cambridge and taken to the museum. Donations and deposits of ethnological, artistic and industrial materials from various entities and private individuals, mostly between the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, increased the collection a great deal. Since 2007, a team of archaeologists from the museum carry out archaeological research at the site of Cornia Nou, which is a Talayotic settlement located near Mah√≥n which counts with two layouts and related buildings.Anglada, M.; Ferrer, A.; Plantalamor, L.; Ramis, D.; Van Strydonck, M. & De Mulder, G. (2014). Chronological framework for the early Talayotic period in Menorca: the settlement of Cornia Nou. Radiocarbon, 56: 411- 424. The council government of the island manages the museum since 2011. In July 2018 the museum reopened after refurbishment works and the setting of an up-to-date permanent exhibition. Building The building was built between the 17th and the 18th centuries. The current headquarters of Museu de Menorca are located in the old Franciscan convent which once belonged to the church of Saint Francis located next to it. Its origins date back to the 15th century, although this first convent was destroyed during the Turkish attack of Mah√≥n in 1535. The building where the museum is located was built between the 17th and the 18th centuries, and was refurbished at the beginning of the 19th century. In the ground floor of the convent there was the reception, the chapter house, the kitchen, the pantry, the cellar, the refectory and the schools of grammar and philosophy. The cells of the friars and other rooms were located in the upper floors. The Franciscans were forced to leave the convent in 1835, after the confiscation of the church by Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal. The building was donated to the city and used by several entities for various educational and cultural functions before it became the museum: house of mercy, nautical school, public library and high school. The cloister of the Museum of Menorca It is arranged in three floors that surround the Baroque squared-shaped cloister, with lower arches and a wing to its South. Several Classical orders combine with Baroque elements. The temporary exhibition rooms and the assembly hall are located in the ground floor, whereas the first and second floors hold the permanent exhibition. Research Museo de Menorca is a frame of reference for the study of the Prehistory, the History and the culture of Menorca, with a collection composed of 200,000 objects. It also has an area where researchers can study the artifacts from this collection. It also has a library open to the public, which counts with a large collection of books and documents on Art and Archaeology, as well as books, journals, catalogues and manuals devoted to various aspects of History, Ethnography, Geography and Culture from Menorca. Most of the archaeological books are highly specialized and cannot be found in other libraries from the island. Periodically the museum publishes scientific archaeological work, collection guides, catalogues of temporary exhibitions and publications for educational purposes that offer the opportunity to learn about the History of the island. Visits and activities The museum offers four types of visits: guided visits, family visits, group visits and visits for schools. Guided visits Open to all publics and prepared according to the interests of the requestor. They include the visit to the temporary rooms and the site of Cornia Nou. For families Families can visit the museum with the help of the staff or asking for a guided tour. For groups The museum designs visits for groups, both free and guided, depending on the needs of the visitors. For schools The museum prepares visits focusing on one or several periods, and designing the routes for each educational level or the needs of students. Moreover, Museu de Menorca organises activities addressed to several publics: workshops for children, gymkhanas, nights at the museum, specialised visits, lectures and presentations of artefacts.

The Tanzanian-led forces easily routed Lira's garrison of Amin loyalists, and then intercepted and destroyed one retreating column of Uganda Army soldiers near the town. Idi Amin had seized power in Uganda in 1971 and established a brutal dictatorship. Seven years later he attempted to invade neighbouring Tanzania to the south. The attack was repulsed, and the Tanzanians launched a counter- attack into Ugandan territory. After a number of battles, Amin's regime and military largely collapsed, whereupon Tanzania and its Ugandan allies of the UNLF began to mop up the last pro-Amin holdouts in Uganda's east and north. One of these was the town of Lira, whose capture was entrusted to a force consisting of the Tanzanian 201st Brigade and the UNLF's Kikosi Maalum force. While approaching Lira, the Tanzanian-UNLF force divided into two groups, with the main force attacking the town from the south. The other force was ordered to set up an ambush along the western approach in order to destroy Uganda Army troops who attempted to flee the town. The Tanzanian-led troops began their assault on Lira on 15 May 1979, and the garrison began to retreat. One column of retreating soldiers ran into the advancing Tanzanian-UNLF troops west of the town, and was almost completely destroyed. Lira was consequently occupied by the Tanzanians and UNLF fighters without further resistance.  Background  Map of the battles of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War In 1971 Idi Amin launched a military coup that overthrew the President of Uganda, Milton Obote, precipitating a deterioration of relations with the neighbouring state of Tanzania. Amin installed himself as president and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship. In October 1978 Amin launched an invasion of Tanzania. Tanzania halted the assault, mobilised anti-Amin opposition groups, and launched a counter-offensive. In a matter of months, the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) and its Ugandan rebel allies (unified under the umbrella organisation \\"Uganda National Liberation Front\\", abbreviated UNLF) defeated the Uganda Army in a number of battles, and occupied Kampala, Uganda's capital, on 11 April 1979. With his military disintegrating or already in open revolt, Amin's rule was finished. Having escaped from Kampala, he consequently traveled to a succession of cities in eastern and northern Uganda, urging his remaining forces \\"to go back and fight the enemy who had invaded our country\\", even as he prepared to flee into exile. Most Uganda Army units opted to surrender, desert or defect to the Tanzanian-led forces, but some decided to continue to fight for Amin's collapsing regime. Thus, the Tanzanians and the UNLF allies continued their advance to secure eastern, northwestern and northern Uganda. The Tanzanian 201st Brigade under Brigadier Imran Kombe and a smaller number of UNLF fighters were ordered to capture the important town of Lira in the north. The UNLF fighters consisted of Kikosi Maalum members loyal to ex-President Obote, and were led by Lieutenant Colonel David Oyite-Ojok. The entire force consisted of about 5,000 troops. Lira was home to one of the largest Uganda Army barracks in the country. Throughout the spring of 1979, Amin loyalists harassed, abducted, and murdered residents in the surrounding area because many had tribal links to Obote and were thus considered suspect. They also maintained a roadblock in the town and harassed passing civilians. After the fall of Kampala, Uganda Army troops from the south moved into Lira, and the local population fled. The soldiers then looted all of the town's shops and banks.  Prelude  Map of central Uganda, including the main roads in red and Lake Kyoga in the center Kombe realised that the most obvious way to approach Lira was from the west, along the main road which was located at Lake Kyoga's western side. The Uganda Army garrison was probably expecting that the Tanzanians would take this route. To surprise the Amin loyalists, Kombe consequently decided to instead cross Lake Kyoga by boat, then take the small roads through the nearby swamps, and attack Lira from the south. This plan had the additional benefit of preventing the 201st Brigade from running into other Tanzanian units, reducing the risk of possible intermingling and confusion. One major drawback to Kombe's idea was, however, that Lake Kyoga lacked ships large enough to transport all his men across, let alone tanks and artillery. With some help from locals, the 201st Brigade's scouts managed to find at least one small and old, but functional ferry at Namasale on Lake Kyoga's eastern side. The pilot initially refused to let the soldiers use his ship, which was owned by a Uganda Army officer. Kombe gave him food and cooking oil and assured him that he could keep the ferry once the war was over. He then agreed to help the Tanzanians and started to transport the 201st Brigade from Lwampanga (near Nakasongola) across the lake in twenty-hour shifts, though he and the Tanzanian soldiers had to deal with constant engine breakdowns. At one point, the wooden paddles on one of the wheels broke loose, and Tanzanian soldiers had to retrieve them from the lake and lash them back to the wheel. After almost a week, the entire brigade was moved, but its tanks, too heavy for transport, were left behind. After crossing Lake Kyoga, the Tanzanian-UNLF force advanced toward Lira. At the same time, Kombe refined his plans. He wanted to secure a tangible victory at Lira, but knew that the Uganda Army had repeatedly put up only a token resistance at several locations, and then retreated. In order to prevent the Amin loyalists in the town from escaping, Kombe subsequently decided to split his force, and have one small unit set up an ambush west of Lira while the main force would frontally attack the town; if the Amin loyalists attempted to flee, they would run into the ambushing force, and be annihilated. He selected Lieutenant Colonel Roland Chacha's battalion of 600 Tanzanians, supported by 150 UNLF fighters, to set up the ambush. These troops would travel lightly, taking only small arms and a few light mortars with them. Though the scouts who were supposed to chart the path for Chacha's force failed to return, Kombe ordered the operation to begin by midafternoon on 14 May. The Tanzanian-UNLF force moved out of the village of Agwata toward Lira, which lay 25 miles to the north. At first, Chacha's troops continued their march on the road directly toward Lira in order to lure the Amin loyalists into believing that they were preparing for the frontal assault. The Tanzanian and UNLF troops suffered from intense heat, and progress was slow, also because the Ugandan rebels suffered from indiscipline and often broke ranks to take water from sympathetic civilians on the sides of the road. This stopped after Chacha stripped one of his uniform for straying from the column and ejected him from the army. When night fell, Chacha's column diverted from the road and began its trek through the bush toward the area selected for the ambush. Progress was hindered by the darkness (it was a moonless night), the difficult terrain, and the lack of maps so that Chacha had to rely on a compass and dead reckoning to find the way. Despite this, the Tanzanian-UNLF force had to cover forty miles in order to reach its target before morning, and the pace was consequently a near run. The Associated Press later described the march as \\"gruelling\\". Nevertheless, Chacha's forces remained completely silent, and thus fooled the Amin loyalists into believing that they were still at the main road. The Tanzanian-UNLF force was in fact so silent that the entire 750-strong column passed by a local hut without waking its inhabitants. Around 2 a.m., Lira's garrison started to shell the former position of Chacha's battalion. After nearly 20 hours of marching, the Tanzanian-UNLF force reached the Gulu road at dawn, and took shelter in an adjacent orchard. They found Chacha's scouts there, who stated that they had been too exhausted to return to the battalion. Chacha ordered the UNLF fighters to assume positions along the road while his men rested in case Ugandan forces passed through. Meanwhile, over the course of the night, one detachment of the 201st Brigade moved around to the eastern flank of Lira, cutting it off from Soroti, while another took up position north of the town to block access to Kitgum. In anticipation of attack, the estimated 300-strong garrison of Lira destroyed the bridges east of town and established defences there and to the south.  Battle  Kombe launched his attack later in the morning on 15 May with a 30-minute artillery bombardment of Lira, followed by an advance into the town. A significant part of the Uganda Army garrison started to retreat along the western road as expected. Upon hearing the artillery fire, Chacha's force began its advance down the road towards Lira, which was 12 kilometres away. One Tanzanian company stayed in the rear as reserve, one moved along the road, and one swept the bush along the right flank. The UNLF troops moved through the bush on the left flank. Some of the Amin loyalists who fled immediately after the beginning of Kombe's attack managed to escape the area. The Tanzanian-UNLF force advanced down the western road until a Ugandan truck came into view on the crest of a hill. The driver saw the troops and quickly turned around and drove out of sight. Five minutes later five Ugandan trucks, a bus, and several Land Rovers pulled over the crest of the hill. One of the Land Rovers was mounted with a 106 mm recoilless rifle, while two of the trucks towed double-barreled antiaircraft machine guns. The convoy quickly moved to the bottom of the hill. The Tanzanians initially thought that the group planned to surrender. Instead, the Ugandan soldiers set up the antiaircraft guns and opened fire, while the Land Rover with the recoilless rifle pulled off into the thicket. When Chacha and his bodyguard stood up to get a better look at the convoy, the latter was hit instantly in the head and killed; the Tanzanian-led troops thus realised that the Uganda Army soldiers' aim was relatively good. Outranged, the Tanzanian- UNLF force had to stay close to the ground and advance very slowly while closing in on the convoy to bring their own weapons to bear. The recoilless rifle also opened fire, though its first shot missed the Tanzanians by 200 meters. The Ugandan gunner readjusted, and the next shells landed increasingly closer to Chacha's position, worrying the Tanzanians. Despite this, the 201st Brigade's soldiers remained calm and continued to move toward their enemies, and when one shell hit the ground only fifty meters from the Tanzanians without an explosion, they realised that the Amin loyalists were using the wrong ammunition; the recoilless rifle was firing HEAT shells which were supposed to be used against armored targets such as tanks, but extremely ineffective against infantry. As his forces moved closer to the Ugandans, Chacha ordered rocket-propelled grenades to be fired into the air. The weapons were employed too far away to inflict any damage, but Chacha hoped that the explosions would frighten the Ugandan troops. Burning wreckage of the Uganda Army convoy along the Gulu road The Tanzanian-UNLF force was thus able to get close enough to use their mortars without suffering significant casualties. After two misses, the Tanzanians struck the lead Land Rover in the Ugandan column, setting it ablaze. They gradually advanced their fire down the road, and within a few minutes most of the vehicles had been destroyed. The wreckage of the convoy burned, detonating fuel and ammunition stocks. A single Land Rover that had avoided being struck drove towards the Tanzanians in an attempt to effect a breakout. It was disabled with gunfire, and its three occupants were shot as they attempted to flee. The surviving Uganda Army soldiers scattered and fled into the nearby swamp along the left side of the road. They were pursued by the UNLF fighters, while the Tanzanians celebrated their victory and took measure of the Uganda Army's losses. When the UNLF fighters returned to the road with eight prisoners, they were thus ignored by the Tanzanian soldiers. The militants discussed what to do with the captured soldiers, with some arguing for summary execution, and others for turning them over to the Tanzanian military. One UNLF fighter eventually decided the dispute on his own by simply shooting the prisoners. Believing combat to be over, some Tanzanian soldiers grew lax, and walked past the destroyed convoy, only to be targeted by a Uganda Army sniper who promptly killed two. This incident, however, marked the last serious resistance of the Uganda Army at Lira. All remaining Amin loyalists fled, and 18 more Ugandan soldiers were captured by the TPDF on other roads out of the town. The rest of the Uganda Army loyalists fled north. The Tanzanian-UNLF force occupied Lira without further resistance on 15 or 16 May. The town was mostly deserted‚Äîmany civilians had fled out of fear of the Amin loyalist garrison‚Äîand some properties were found looted. At least part of the civilian population reportedly greeted the UNLF with enthusiasm, lifting Oyite-Ojok onto their shoulders in celebration. In all, over 70 Uganda Army soldiers were killed in the battle, while just four Tanzanians died and four others were wounded. The Amin loyalists also lost important military equipment at Lira, diminishing their ability to further resist the northward advance by the Tanzanian-UNLF forces.  Aftermath  Lira was the last place where the disintegrating Uganda Army attempted to make an organised stand, though scattered bands of Amin loyalists continued to fight the Tanzanian-UNLF forces, such as during the Battle of Karuma Falls. The Sudan News Agency, attempting to frame the conflict as an anti-Islamic campaign, erroneously reported that the TPDF massacred Muslims after occupying Lira. Kombe allowed Chacha's battalion to stay in the town for four days to recuperate. In its final action of the war, the 201st Brigade subsequently, peacefully occupied Kitgum, which had been taken over by anti-Amin militiamen, thus removing all towns east of the White Nile from pro-Amin control. The unit was thus the second TPDF brigade to complete its allotted tasks for the conflict. The war ended on 3 June, when the TPDF reached the Sudanese border and expelled the last pro-Amin forces from Uganda. Remnants of the Uganda Army subsequently reorganised in the northwestern border regions and launched a rebellion against the new Ugandan government in 1980. At the same time, Kikosi Maalum initiated a mass recruitment campaign in Lira and surrounding areas. With Amin defeated, the various rebel factions that had formed the UNLF were preparing for a showdown with each other. The Lango people who lived in the region around Lira were regarded as sympathic toward Obote and thus secretly recruited, trained, armed, and organised into militias by Kikosi Maalum to help Obote seize power in Uganda and destroy his rivals. To keep these war preparations secret, Kikosi Maalum forcibly expelled all non-Lango inhabitants from Lira and Apac. One group that reportedly suffered most from this policy were the region's Nubians whose lands and properties were seized by the new authorities in Lira; the Nubians were regarded as partisans of Idi Amin. According to the Sudanese government, violent attacks against Nubians in Lira led a number of them to flee to Sudan as refugees.

It is the crossing point of the main and diagonal axes of the Hofgarten.  History  The Diana Temple was created in 1613-1617 in Italian style together with the Hofgarten and goes back to Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. The temple forms the center of the garden and was probably created by Heinrich Sch√∂n around the year 1615. On it is a famous bronze figure, a copy of the Bavaria bronze statue of Hubert Gerhard. The original can be found in the Residenzmuseum. The bronze figure that crowns the roof was created in 1594 by Hans Krumpper and symbolizes the riches of Bavaria. In the temple itself, four wall mounted shell fountains can be found.  Use  View through the round arches with floor mosaic and ceiling design Like the whole Hofgarten, the Diana Temple is usually open to the public. Exceptions are rare, such as when it was used as a backdrop for filming (for example, The Three Musketeers (2011)), and the access from Odeonsplatz is occasionally not possible during major events (for example Klassik am Odeonsplatz). Concerts are held in the pavilion and street musicians entertain the park visitors; In the summer evenings, it serves as an unofficial and informal meeting place for dancers (Tango Argentino, salsa and swing). These non-commercial events are tolerated as long as there is no noise disturbance to residents or harassment of other visitors. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, sometimes a crowd of people form to watch the dancers. For such uses, an agreement with the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes, which assigns in particular the permits for the street musicians is required.

Early life Mahmoodi was born in 1990 near Tehran, Iran, the child of Hazara refugees who had fled persecution in Afghanistan in 1975. In 2000, when she was nine, she organised a girls' football club at her school, but this was shut down by the school administration. Shortly afterwards, her father set up a small workshop manufacturing footballs; Mahmoodi worked in the shop during the day and practised in the evenings in secret. In 2004 the Iranian government banned Afghan refugees from attending school, and the family decided to return to Afghanistan. There, Mahmoodi began organising informal women's football competitions in Kabul. Career In 2007, Mahmoodi was recruited by the Afghanistan Football Federation to be part of the first Afghanistan women's national football team. She became the team captain in 2010, leading the team at the South Asian Football Federation women's championship in 2010 - the first time that an Afghani team had competed.

Although he attended a religious academy he chose to make the army his career, rising to the rank of Major General in the First Regiment of Foot Guards. He was killed at the Battle of Saint Cast in Brittany at the age of 54.  Early life  He was born in Edinburgh on 10 December 1704, and christened the next day. He was a son of the Huguenot immigrants Theodore Du Ry (born in France in 1661) and Mary-Anne Boulier De Beauregard. Dury attended the Geneva Academy, with Antoine Maurice (later professor of divinity) as his mentor. The Academy was founded by Calvin and, at the time Dury was there, had the primary aim of training ministers. Dury, however, studied languages and belles lettres: his outstanding intellectual abilities had been acclaimed and he was admired for the brilliant exposition of his thesis ‚ÄòDe Terrae Motu‚Äô [On the Earthquake]. He returned to Britain at the end of May 1721.\\"  Personal life  Dury married Isabella Turnor at St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington on 24 July 1753. They had two sons: *Alexander (1 Oct 1754 ‚Äì 13 Oct 1754) *Alexander (17 Aug 1756 ‚Äì 28 Feb 1825). He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford on 31 Oct 1774, and later became an Ensign in the First Regiment of Foot Guards in 1775, was promoted Captain, later Lieutenant-Colonel, a Company Commander, in 1789, and retired in 1794. Dury was great-grandfather of Theodore Seton Dury (1854-1932) and 2nd great- grandfather of Lieutenant Colonel Guy Alexander Ingram Dury (1895-1976), known as Guy, of the Grenadier Guards, who were both English first-class cricketers. The pedigree of the Dury family, from the mid-seventeenth century, is available online. Several had military careers. Alexander Dury's portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1758. Dury wrote his will on 11 May 1758. After his death his extensive library was auctioned over a period of four days. Dury's library \\"reflected both his wealth and his strong, continuing enthusiasm for his books on war\\"; some 120 titles on war accounted for more than a fifth of his collection. Military career Dury's father, Theodore (naturalised in 1706), was a military engineer in Hugh Mackay‚Äôs Foot, designing the fortification of Stirling Castle and elsewhere, and was able to afford commissions for both his sons. Thus, Alexander Dury was commissioned into the First Regiment of Foot Guards on 24 June 1721. He was appointed First Major on 10 October, 1747; Lieutenant-Colonel on 9 May 1749; and Major General on 15 Feb 1757. Early in his career, Dury was assigned to special intelligence duties. One such was the detention in 1744 of the elderly and infirm Colonel William Cecil. Cecil been gathering data on the numbers of Jacobite sympathisers in England who would rally to support Marshal Saxe in his invasion of England, and was sent to The Tower. Dury was also involved with the arrest of an even more important Jacobite, James Barry, 4th Earl of Barrymore. Dury's next notable assignment came the following year. During the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 the Duke of Cumberland was annoyed by what he considered to be ill treatment of English wounded and prisoners by the French, in breach of the agreement on prisoners of war reached with Noailles some two years earlier. However Saxe argued that the English were already in breach of the agreement by confining at the Round Tower, Windsor Castle, the prestigious Marshal Belle-Isle and his brother, who had had been captured in Hanover. It was decided to free the Belle-Isle brothers, and Dury was immediately detailed to escort them back to France. He first took his distinguished charges to London where, incognito, they were given a tour of some of the main sights. After returning to the Palace of Westminster and the Abbey, and then a good supper, they were taken to see the Doggett's Coat and Badge rowing race on the Thames (and not to see Swan Upping as reported by Whitworth). More sightseeing took place next day and, on the following morning, the Marshal's party was escorted out of London to Blackheath, and thence to Canterbury and Dover. The returning Mar√©chal was warmly welcomed in Calais, where he presented Dury with a gold-hilted sword. Alexander Dury took part in the Battle of Lauffeld in 1747, and then at the siege of Maastricht in 1748. Ten years later he was in charge of a brigade of Guards which was to sail to northern France. The object was a series of ‚Äúdescents‚Äù (diversionary raids) which would draw the French forces away from central Europe - in particular Hanover. One such attack was the raid on Cherbourg in August, in which the French put up little resistance and the port and forts were razed. After their success the British moved west for a descent on St Malo, but this failed and many men were lost. They then moved to St. Cast in Brittany, arriving on 11 September 1758. Disaster struck: during the battle the British lost more than twice as many men as the French, as they fled back to their vessels. Alexander Dury was killed that day while trying to help his men get aboard.

The range comprised the high Duple 300 service bus, the high Duple 320 coach, and the taller high Duple 340 coach. The 320 and 340 coaches were announced at the Bus and Coach Show at Earls Court in September 1985 as replacements for the previous Laser and Caribbean. Deliveries of these models commenced in 1986, whilst the 300 bus was launched in 1987 as a replacement for the Dominant Bus. After Duple closed down the designs were sold to Plaxton and a small number of additional 320 bodies were built as the Plaxton 321. Variants Duple 320 When it was launched the 320 was available on 11-metre long Bedford YNT and Leyland Tiger chassis and 12m long Bedford YNV, Leyland Tiger, DAF MB200 / MB230 and Volvo B10M chassis. Subsequently a few old 11 and 12 m Leyland Leopard chassis received replacement Duple 320 bodies, and a batch of 12m 320s was built on rear- engined Scania K93 chassis in 1988. However, the most popular chassis for the 320 would prove to be the Dennis Javelin. At the time of its launch in 1986 both Dennis and Duple were under common ownership by the Hestair Group so the Duple 320 body was the obvious choice for Javelin prototypes. After series production began in 1988 the Javelin/320 combination accounted for about one third of Duple's coach output. In addition to the standard 11- and 12-metre versions, the Dennis Javelin was also available as an 8.5 m midicoach. Duple 340 The taller Duple 340 was intended to be more upmarket than the 320 and was only available on 12-metre long heavyweight chassis. Initially these were the mid-engined DAF MB200 / MB230, Leyland Tiger and Volvo B10M and the rear-engined DAF SB2305, but the Scania K93 also became available in 1988.. The 320 and 340 shared similar front ends and windscreens, but the 340 could be distinguished by its greater height, with the side windows being stepped up slightly behind the door/cab window and a curved front roof dome over the cab. Duple 300 Although primarily a coach manufacturer, Duple also manufactured bus bodies on a limited scale. The 300 was introduced two years after the coach versions of the series and was available on 11 m Dennis Javelin, Leyland Tiger and Volvo B10M chassis, selling in small quantities only. The largest customer was Hutchison's Coaches of Overtown, Lanarkshire, which purchased 15 Volvos. The 300 had little visual similarity to the coach models apart from the use of similar front grille/headlamps and rear window. Plaxton 321 Duple had struggled with a declining market share throughout the 1980s and the business was closed down at the end of the 1989 season. The rights to manufacture the 300 series bodies and the Duple 425 integral were purchased by Plaxton, which planned to restart production of the former Duple range at its own Scarborough factory and its French subsidiary Carrosserie Lorraine. In the event these plans were thwarted by declining economic conditions which limited the demand for new coaches. Indeed, the last Dennis Javelin/Duple 320 built for dealer stock was not registered until 1993 (K326ANC). Production of the 300 and 340 did not resume, but Plaxton did re- engineer the 320 to include standard Plaxton parts, in which form it could be sold at a lower price than the equivalent Plaxton Paramount 3200 III. A single batch of 25 12-metre Leyland Tigers was bodied at Scarborough in 1991 and sold through the Kirkby coach dealership as the Plaxton 321, but no further examples were built.

He was a prominent figure within the courts of the Carolingian kings Lothar II (855-869) and Charles the Bald (840-877). Adventius's family background is not clear, but historians generally agree whilst he was not born into a ‚Äògreat‚Äô aristocratic family, it was likely still into a distinguished nobility. Adventius was educated under Drogo, illegitimate son of Charlemagne and the former Bishop of Metz (820-855) prior to Adventius's appointment to the position. He played a prominent role within Carolingian politics during the 860s and 870s. The image of the Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve has been interpreted by some as displaying Charles the Bald flanked by Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims and Bishop Adventius of Metz  Involvement in Lothar II's divorce case  Adventius was heavily involved in the divorce case of Lothar II (c.858-869). Lothar desired to divorce his wife Theutberga (d. 875) in favour of being with his mistress and childhood sweetheart Waldrada for a multitude of potential reasons that were used within the divorce case itself and have been speculated by historians, including Theutberga's inability to bear an heir, her family's potential political insignificance by 858, and Lothar's simple but overwhelming desire to be with Waldrada. Adventius was primarily a supporter of Lothar's efforts to leave his wife Theutberga, although it has been suggested by historians he was a ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô rather than a ‚Äòhardline‚Äô supporter of the king's intentions. This is apparent following the findings of the Third Council of Aachen in 862, which deemed that Lothar's marriage to Theutberga was over and he was allowed to remarry. Adventius and Archbishop Gunther of Cologne (850-873) both recorded their interpretations of the findings of the Council, but Adventius's account is more reserved and depicts the bishops who participated in it as merely participating in response to Lothar's request of convening the Council, whereas Gunthar's account is more forceful in asserting the findings of the Council and rebuts potential criticisms in his conclusion. Pope Nicholas I (858-867) however, called for another council in 863 at Metz, which his legates would attend alongside Lotharingian bishops, along with specific criteria listed in his Commontorium that needed to be met in order for his approval that the decision for Lothar to divorce Theutberga was legitimate. However, the wrath of Nicholas was invoked when he learned that his legates had been bribed, and when two of Lothar's leading supporters Archbishops Gunther of Cologne and Theutgard of Trier travelled to Rome in October to present the findings of the Council, Nicholas excommunicated the pair, annulled the decision of the Council, and demanded all other Lotharingian bishops who had supported Lothar to explain themselves or risk being excommunicated themselves. Adventius was one the recipients of this furious outburst from the pope, and in 864 sent the pope a reply in which he vehemently apologised for his behaviour and pleaded that even though present at the 863 Council of Metz, he had only gone along with the consensus and was oblivious that there had been any wrongdoing. This evidently went down well with the pope, as Adventius remained in office as Bishop of Metz, unlike his peers Gunther and Theutgard. Lothar refused to accept this decision from the pope until 865, when he reluctantly remarried Theutberga in the presence of several leading counts and bishops, with Adventius included in this ensemble. Although the divorce case did not see the same dramatic developments it had previously witnessed after 865, Adventius maintained a dossier of material relating to Lothar's divorce which can be found today within the Biblioteca Vallicelliana I 76 in Rome. This was presumably so Adventius had a set of correspondence and precedents with which he could back up any future debates on the divorce case.  Political Career and Death  Although Adventius was loyal to Lothar II during the latter's reign as king, the bishop also remained on good terms with Lothar's uncle and fellow Carolingian king Charles the Bald and his prominent archbishop Hincmar of Rheims. As such, Adventius was often sent to West Francia by Lothar to deliver messages to Charles, for example in 861 and 868. This positive relationship enjoyed by Adventius and Charles was more sharply put into focus in 869, when Lothar II died of malaria. Charles the Bald quickly had himself crowned at Metz by Adventius on September 9 869, claiming a large amount of Lothar's previous territories in the west of Lotharingia. Additionally, Adventius gave a speech that underlined the legitimacy of Charles inheriting his nephew's kingdom. Writing a generation later, Regino of Prum says Charles was easily able to inherit a large portion of Lothar's kingdom due to the ‚Äòingratiated‚Äô influence of Adventius. Various councils that occurred with either Lothar, Charles or his brother Louis the German (843-876) took place at Metz during the 860s and early 870s, and Adventius would have attended almost all of these. Around 871, Adventius founded the monastery of Neum√ºnster, in the Saarland, perhaps as an attempt to cement episcopal control in the far east of his diocese. Adventius died in 875 at an unknown location.

The FAI as a militant anarcho-syndalicalism organization came into existence prior to the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera because of differing views on government engagement, but its formalization as an organization only occurred in 1927 during a clandestine meeting which saw Garc√≠a Oliver chosen as their initial leader. Despite the more liberal policies of the Second Republic, male anarchists generally opposed women's groups and women's involvement, seeing it as a threat to their own status. Men in the FAI were vehemently opposed to the creation of Mujeres Libres, a women's only anarchist organization created in response to female exclusion from the broader anarchist movement. The Spanish Civil War saw a rise in status for the FAI among anarchist organizations. The FAI attracted milicianas (English: Militawomen) from within its ranks. It also saw one of its female members, Federica Montseny, serving as the Minister to Health in the Republican government. After the war, many former members would look back fondly at the utopian aspects of women's liberation supported by the FAI during the Second Republic and the Civil War. Many of them had to do so though from exile.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800‚Äì1922)  Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica (FAI), a militant anarcho-syndalicalism organization, started their ideological split from the more labor based Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) shortly before the start the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. The initial group believed the move towards being a trade union involved too much need for support among from Spanish institutions to work towards their ideals. The drift started in the period between 1920 and 1922, and intensified following the assassination of Salvador Segu√≠ in March 1923. FAI's supporters believed CNT's anarcho-syndicalists goals could not be met by allying themselves with members of the left.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923‚Äì1930)  FAI and CNT's official rift came in 1927 during a clandestine meeting in 1927 in Valencia which saw the group's formal creation, with Garc√≠a Oliver chosen as their initial leader. Federica Montseny, only 22 years old at the time, was one of the only women who attended the meeting, and would go on to be one of the most visible faces of women in FAI. It would soon be positioned as the most important anarchist organization in the country. In contrast to the dominant machismo of the period found in organizations like the CNT, the FAI was radical in their support of free women. Their official positions included supporting the distribution of birth control and not condemning women for having sexual relations. In the 1920s, this group of anarchists viewed women having fewer children, increased sex education and the elimination of prostitution as positions that would provide resistance to the institutions and ideologies they opposed, including capitalism, religion and the military. These changes would also emancipate women, by defining them around a task other than reproduction.  Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1937)  On the whole, the anarchist movement's male leadership engaged in deliberate exclusion of women, discouraging them from seeking leadership positions in these organizations. With few exceptions, women were effectively locked out of the two largest and most important anarchist organizations in Spain, Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo and the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica. Women found it difficult to join the organization, and even more difficult to get leadership positions. Despite these obstacles, Federica Montseny had risen to become a member of FAI leadership by 1936. From her position, she advocated avoiding armed conflict with fascists. This view would contribute to her later being named Minister of Health in the Government of the Second Republic. The first edition of Mujeres Libres, a magazine published by the organization of the same name FAI opposed to the creation of Mujeres Libres, a women's only anarchist organization founded in the last days before the start of the Civil War, as they believed separating women's issues from the main anarchist organizations was sexist. They were joined in their opposition to Mujeres Libres being part of the broader anarchist movement by the CNT and Juventudes Libertarias (FIJL). FAI's male membership believed that the existence of the organization sewed dissent in the movement at a time when both men and women should be working together to advance the rights of the working class. The impact of inflexible patriarchy was that women in the FAI were forced into more submissive roles inside the organization, were forced out, or were made unwelcome. The animosity expressed by FAI, CNT and FIJL in this period bothered Mujeres Libres greatly, these women viewing anarchist leaders as believing in strict gender roles that perpetuated patriarchy and machismo. Despite general male condemnation of women's interests, Baltasar Lobo became one of the few men in this period with FAI or CNT ties who assisted the women of Mujeres Libres. He and his wife Mercedes Comaposada Guill√©n, together with Luc√≠a S√°nchez Saornil and Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n created the Mujeres Libres magazine.  Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)  Milicianas of CNT-FAI in Barcelona in July 1936 The Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo and the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica continued their role in leading the anarchist movement as the Spanish Civil War period started. Representing working-class people, both groups set out to prevent the Nationalists from seizing control while also serving as reforming influences inside Spain. FAI's interest in women in this period was often less about women's emancipation than about attracting adept fighters and politicians who would help them achieve their broader goals for workers rights. On 15 October 1936, Ziryanin reached the port in Barcelona. It was the first Russian supply ship to reach the city. Its arrival led to the masses taking to the streets in numbers not seen since 19 July 1936, the start of the Civil War. Among the throngs greeting the ship were the FAI aligned Mujeres Libres, who marched eight across while singing anarchist songs. FAI attracted milicianas (literally Militiawomen) from within its ranks. The number of women mobilized was never high. Most joined in order to further the political ideologies they supported. Most came from militant libertarian organizations like CNT, FAI and FIJL. These militias often lacked the typical military structure in order to better represent their ideologies and better mobilize local populations. Soledad Estorach Esterri was involved in the 18 July 1936 siege of the barracks of the Casa Camb√≥ shipyards. After it was successfully taken, the facility became Casa CNT-FAI. During the Civil War, she also traveled around Catalonia, Aragon and Valencia, serving as a representative of CNT, FAI and JJLL . Casa CNT-FAI would soon see regular visits by FAI affiliated women including Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n Mart√≠ Fuster and Dolores Cascante. During the Civil War, Mart√≠ Fuster frequently published articles in FAI affiliated publications. Federica Montseny in Barcelona on 1977, in her first visit from exile since 1939 Federica Montseny served as the Minister of Health, where she continued her support of anarchist organizations, only leaving this position in May 1937. She was the first woman in Spain to serve as a Minister. Her appointment along with that of three men, represented an important inclusion of both anarchist factions, CNT and CAI, into the government of the Second Republic. From her position as a CNT-FAI representative, Montseny enacted policies that allowed for the legalization of abortion in parts of Spain still controlled by Republican forces, sex education and the distribution of contraceptives. When Juan Negr√≠n became the head of the Republican armed forces in May 1937, women's time in combat ended as he continued efforts to regularize Republican forces into the Republican Army.  Francoist Spain (1938‚Äì1973)  On the losing side of the Civil War, the survivors of FAI would appreciate their support for women's personal freedoms as a utopian aspect that supported their anarchist philosophies. Many had to do so from exile. The end of the Civil War saw Mart√≠ Fuster removed from both FAI and CNT membership, probably as a result of her refusal to cooperate with Stalinists in their battle against Nazi Germany in France. This deeply demoralized her, and played a role in her eventual suicide on 1 December 1960. Federica Montseny also fled into exile following the fall of the Second Republic.

From early in its history, there was a belief that a woman's primary role was to reproduce and that only men should be in the workforce. Few women were involved in the early efforts inside Spain, and internationally there were active attempts to keep women out. The formal creation of the CNT in 1910 did little to change this. Anarchist men inside the CNT actively tried to keep women out to avoid diminishing their own importance. The creation of the Second Republic did little to change this dynamic. Women were largely locked out of the CNT and events in this period, even when the groups claimed to be in favor of gender equity and their articles of federation claimed to support women's rights. Mujeres Libres was created in this period, and served as the largest and most important women's organization of its kind. Founded by women who were locked out of the CNT, it was doubly discriminated against for its affiliation with the CNT and deliberate efforts by the CNT to deny the group recognition as an affiliate. The CNT ignored working class women, and made the hunger situation worse in cities like Barcelona where the leadership blamed women for bread and food riots. The termination of the Civil War was another punishment for anarchist women and women affiliated in any way with the CNT. Many wives, daughters and mothers of CNT militia people, former milicianas and CNT members were executed by Francoist forces, while others found themselves being given life sentences in prisons. Women continued to support the CNT clandestinely, although in the absence of CNT records, their history remains incomplete.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800‚Äì1922)   Early Spanish anarcho-syndicalism  The early Spanish anarcho-syndalicalism movement drew part of its philosophy regarding women from the first congress of the International Workers' Association () (AIT) in 1866. The congress created a resolution that said, \\"Without the family, the human species is only a conglomerate of beings, without certain functions, without reason, without law and without purposes. Without the family, men are a huge confused, immense community, where the only enemy is man. Without the family, women do not have on the earth, have no reason for being, since without the family woman is only a wandering being, condemned by her physical constitution to premature exhaustion, to incessant and impotent efforts, which transform her organism in a radical way and amount to the negation of the species and the disappearance of the species.\\" The international Congress then went on to defend distinct sex roles based on biology where femaleness is defined by procreation. The belief carried on in the movement that women should remain out of the workforce as an appendage to man because of man's need to reproduce. Views in Spain changed little in the next ten years. While the 1872 Congreso de la Regional de Espa√±a in Zaragoza published a declaration espousing equal rights between the sexes, this period otherwise saw little material, especially material aimed at a male audience, to support these utopian positions. More broadly, this mid-19th century in Spain saw no women represented among Spain's unions and trade associations. A few women were involved in the movement, but little is known about them. The two most well known ranking women before the 1900 and the birth of the CNT in 1910 were Manuela D√≠az and Vicenta Dura. They served as secretaries in 1883 in Federaci√≥n Regional Espa√±ola de la Internacional. Beyond this fact, little is known about them, other than their opposition to the Franco-Prussian War, which they signed a petition by Ateneo Catal√°n in Barcelona in 1869, and that they participated in the Federaci√≥n Regional Espa√±ola de la Internacional Congress in 1872 in Zaragoza.  Formation of the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo  The 1910 CNT Congress. The Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo was formed in 1910 as an anarcho-syndicalism organization. The framework of gender being part of the labor and anarchist union movement entered Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo's platform between 1910 and 1913. At this time, when women internationally wanted to be involved in their own national organizations, they were locked out. This included leading feminists of the day like Clara Zetken, Rosa Luxemburg and Alexandra Kollantai who espoused the belief that the personal is political. They were forced into women's only organizations that had little power in the broader movement. The only opportunities for them to full integrate was through youth organizations or the formation of women only trade unions. The 1918 Congress of CNT demonstrated the gender based tensions among anarchists in Spain. Men tried to use the Congress to assert their own power over women in both the public and private sphere. This was in large part because male anarchists did not want to see a power dynamic change which would result in a diminishment of their own status. Much of the early history of this period is only known because of Teresa Claramunt, Soledad Gustavo, Maria Caro, Angela Graupera, key women in CNT in terms of creating a history of women's voices and documenting their activities in the pre-Republic and Republic periods. It was during this period from 1910 to 1920 that anarchist women eschewed CNT. A consequence of their rejection of CNT was the creation women's only organizations in Spain including Acci√≥n Femenina in 1921. Another consequence of male rejection of female involvement was that some women sympathetic to their cause were rejected from participating, even on the margins. Maria Dolores Rodr√≠guez sympathized greatly with the movement, but her embrace of Catholicism and its organizational structure resulted in her being excluded from it. Women both inside and outside CNT continued to make and refine arguments about the role of women and sex in anarchist philosophy, with most of the women who would later create Mujeres Libres writing about these issues during the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. Their arguments would be further refined as a result of World War I, where they saw the impact of the need for women across Europe to work outside their homes.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923‚Äì1930)  During this period, CNT members in many places were required to meet clandestinely. Women continued to refine their positions during the Dictatorship of Primo de Reivera. In the 1920s, anarchist viewed women having fewer children, increased sex education and the elimination of prostitution as position that would provide resistance to institutions and ideologies they opposed, including capitalism, religion and the military. These changes would also emancipate women, by defining them around a task other than reproduction.  Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1937)  CNT was one of the two major anarchist organizations active during the Second Republic. By July 1936, their membership ranks were over 850,000, and were organized by region and sector of employment. CNT ignored specific needs of women, including maternity leave, childcare provisions and equal pay; they instead focused on general needs or needs of men in the workforces they represented. The CNT also perpetuated gender inequality, by paying its female employees less than men in comparable positions. CNT helped bring a right wing government to power after the 1933 elections by refusing to support the Popular Front alliance, and largely chose to abstain from the elections. They changed their positions for the 1936 elections, which assisted in bring the left back into power in the Second Republic. The Second Republic did not result in immediate improvements for women inside the anarcho-syndalicalism movement supported by CNT. Women were largely locked out of organized political groups and events in this period, even when said groups claimed to be for gender equity. Major trade unions at the time like UGT and CNT ignored specific needs of women, including maternity leave, childcare provisions and equal pay; they instead focused on general needs or needs of men in the workforces they represented. The CNT also perpetuated gender inequality, by paying its female employees less than men in comparable positions. Only 4% of UGT's membership was female by 1932. While CNT offered a utopian view of women, the period of the Second Republic saw the realization of a massive contradiction in ideology with practice. Ideology promised liberation for women, but in practice in the CNT it meant subjugation of women. One of the biggest challenges faced by leftist women was Marxism prioritized the issue of class equality over gender issues. For anarchists, syndicalists, communist and socialist women, this often resulted in male leadership deprioritizing women's needs and locking women out of participation and governance as their needs did not directly relate to the class struggle. Some leftist men, both in political and labor organizations, also resented women entering the workforce, viewing their lower wages as contributing to employers lowering wages among male workers. On the whole, the anarchist movement's male leadership engaged in deliberate exclusion of women and discouragement from seeking leadership positions in these organizations. Women were effectively locked out of the two largest anarchist organizations, CNT and the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica (FAI). Continued exclusion from CNT lead women in Barcelona to form Agrupaci√≥n Cultural Femenina in 1935. Its members included Pilar Grangel, √Åurea Cuadrado, Nicolasa Guti√©rrez, Maruja Boadas, Rita Prunes and Conchita Lia√±o. Two years later, with will still not feeling represented by CNT, Mujeres Libres would be created in April 1936, and eventually see membership of over 20,000 women. They would also start publishing a magazine of the same name. The last issue would be published in Barcelona in December 1938, right before the city fell to fascist forces. No issues of it exist. Luc√≠a S√°nchez Satornil had been writing for newspapers and working in Madrid as a secretary for the local CNT branch during the Second Republic. From this position, she became one of CNT's more prominent women, and often collaborated with other labor organization media outfits. In one article, she wrote, \\"The problems of the proletarian woman requires solutions specific to the margin of class conflict resolutions.\\" She would soon team up with other women inside CNT including Mercedes Comaposada, Amparo Poch, Carmen Conde, Suceso Portales and Joaquina Colomer to address these issues. Meanwhile, Libertad Rodenas, Pura P√©rez and Olimpia G√≥mez worked with CNT youth group Juventudes Libertarias to further their goals for women. Women, both inside CNT's structure and in organizations like Mujeres Libres, continued to try to push CNT to change its position on women to little success. CNT Congress in Zaragoza in May 1936 saw the Fabric and Textile Union of Barcelona publish a position that said of women's sexual freedom, \\"Sexual problems must have a moral regulator ... Sexual freedom, even though there should be no penalty of any kind for investment cases (read homosexuality) must be regulated by a higher moral concept tending to consider the sexual act as a derivative of the reproductive function of the species.\\" Despite this, Mujeres Libres , the leading women's anarcho-syndalicalism organization, tried to no avail to get recognition from CNT from May to July 1936, while also trying to bring more women into the movement. The CNT did not listen, and the Civil War then forced upon leadership an accelerated, radical change in its position.  Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)  At the start of the Civil War, there were two primary anarchist organizations: CNT and the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica. Representing working-class people, they set out to prevent the Nationalists from seizing control while also serving as reforming influences inside Spain. Most of the militias that were created during the immediate outbreak of the Civil War came from civil society groups like trade unions and political parties. CNT, UGT and other unions stepped in to provide logistical support for many of these militias. The number of women mobilized was never high. Most joined in order to further support political ideologies they supported. Most came from militant libertarian organizations like CNT, FAI and FIJL. These militias often lacked the typical military structure in order to better represent their ideologies and better mobilize local populations. There are conflicting accounts by historians as to when the decision was made to remove women from the front on the Republican side. One side dates the decision to late fall of 1936 as the date when Prime Minister Francisco Largo Caballero gave the order. Others date the order to March 1937. What is most likely is that various political and military leaders made their own decisions based on their own beliefs that led to different groups of female combatants gradually being withdrawn from the front. When Juan Negr√≠n became the head of the Republican armed forces in May 1937, women's time in combat ended as he continued efforts to regularize Republican forces into the Republican Army. While the war broke down gender norms, it did not create an equitable employment change or remove the domestic tasks as the primary role of women. Behind the scene, away from the front, women serving in personal family and Republican opposition support roles were still expected to cook for soldiers, launder their uniforms, look after children and tend to dwellings. Women supporting CNT militants found themselves at once liberated from these gender roles, but still expected to serve male fighters in traditional roles. Anarcha-feminist militia during the Spanish Social Revolution. Federaci√≥n Nacional de Mujeres Libres was founded in the early months of the war, and quickly gained support by many inside CNT. Despite representing a small slice of CNT membership, these women were able to quickly integrate many unions into rearguard militias. They also formalized their governance structure, including committees and subcommittees. Despite efforts of women in Mujeres Libres, CNT still refuses to recognize Mujeres Libres as a CNT affiliate. CNT leadership continues to maintain a position that women should not have their own separate branch inside the broader movement. This position contradicted their utopian ideals expressed in the organization's articles. This lack of recognition in 1938 was demoralizing, not just to women who supported CNT but inside the broader liberterian movement in Spain. Despite this, Mujeres Libres and other women militants in the CNT continued to go to fight for their ideals, including sex education, education for children, and the preparation of women for their role in society. They also continued to write, and to use the media to try to advance their cause. In February 1939, as a result of many of its members being in exiled internally and externally, being killed, or having disappeared during the Civil War, the organization dissolved. Federica Montseny in Barcelona on 1977, in her first visit from exile since 1939. Women sometimes managed to gain leadership roles despite the many barriers present to them. Federica Montseny served as the Minister to Health, where she continued her support of anarchist organizations, only leaving this position in May 1937. She was the first woman in Spain to serve as a Minister. Her appointment represented an important inclusion of both anarchist factions into the government of the Second Republic. From her position as a CNT-FAI representative, Montseny enacted policies that allowed for the legalization of abortion in parts of Spain still controlled by Republican forces, sex education and the distribution of contraceptives.  Mujeres Libres  The first edition of Mujeres Libres, a magazine published by the organization of the same name. Mujeres Libres became one of the most important women's anarchist organizations during the Civil War. Their Civil War ranks were aided by women moving over from CNT to participation in their organization. The organization's importance was a result of the activities they were carrying out. They included running educational programming, and trying to increase the literacy rate among women. They were also organizing collective kitchens, parent controlled daycare centers, and providing prenatal and infant health information to expecting parents. One of their biggest struggles during the Civil War was around fighting prostitution. Education was viewed a key aspect of this, as they believed educated women would be less likely to turn to prostitution. They had over 20,000 members by 1938. Mujeres Libres also published a journal of the same name. Writings found in it focused on personal autonomy, the creation of female identities, and self-esteem. It also often addressed the conflicts in identity between being a woman and being a mother, and how women should navigate their identities as maternal figures. Mujeres Libres were one of the few organizations in this period that challenged mainstream Western feminist thinking. While deliberately rejecting the label of feminism, the group's version of feminism was about creating leadership structures that incorporated everyone, instead of having a feminist leadership model that paralleled patriarchal ones. Many feminists disliked the organization though, as it was a aligned with CNT, where women were often locked out of leadership positions and instead encouraged into their women's auxiliary organization. During the Civil War, there were often tensions Mujeres Libres and other anarchist groups. The Economic Council of the Socialized Woodwork Industry and Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista both had women in high level leadership positions, and in leadership spots further down. In contrast, Mujeres Libres was a CNT auxiliary, and the women were often denied a specific spot at the table as there was a view among anarchist leaders that the adults, not women, should be the ones making decisions. Other anarchist organizations often were unwilling to give solidarity to women combating gender based problems at this time. There were always questions of if women should be fully integrated or should work in women's only groups to achieve specific aims. This resulted in making the movement less effective in accomplishing goals related to women. The October 1938 CNT congress in Barcelona saw Mujeres Libres locked out, with the fifteen women strong delegation barred from entering. Women had previously been allowed to attend, but only as representatives of other, mixed gendered anarchist organizations. A women's only organization was not tolerated. The women protested this, and would not get an answer until an extraordinary meeting of CNT on 11 February 1939. When their answer came, it was that \\"an indepdendent women's organization would undermine the overall strength of the libertarian movement and inject and element of disunity that would have negative consequences for the development of working-class interests and the libertarian movement on the whole.\\" A woman in Barcelona waits during the Spanish Civil War. Working class women in Barcelona would often queue for hours for bread in 1937, only to find none was available. This sometimes would lead to rioting, which CNT leadership then worked hard to fault each other over in an attempt to avoid responsibility for the bread shortage. The problem was compounded by the fact that middle and upper-class people in Barcelona were readily buying bread on the black market. One riot occurred on 6 May 1937, when women looted vans full of oranges at the Barcelona port. When this aspect was brought to attention, CNT offered sexist excuses as to why working class women were unable to buy bread. The result was that ordinary working class women in the city often turned on anarchist women, and blaming them despite the anarchist women not being involved in CNT leadership. Mujeres Libres, CNT's women's arm, addressed this problem by taking action into their own hands, and staging assaults on markets to provide food for other women. Food riots would become a common feature in Barcelona during the Civil War. The end of the Civil War in February 1939 led to the organization's dissolution as a result of many of its members being in exiled internally and externally, being killed, or having disappeared during the Civil War.  Francoist Spain (1938‚Äì1973)  Following the end of the Civil War, there was a major crackdown on women affiliated in any way with the CNT. This included wives, daughters and mothers of CNT militia people. Many were executed in the final days of the Civil War. Others had death sentences commuted, and were locked up in prisons for years where many were also tortured. Despite the risks, many women continued to be involved in the CNT in clandestine roles. These included Lola Iturbe, Sara Berenguer, Benigna Calve, Casilda M√©ndez, Maria Bruguera, Julia Mirabe, Gracia Ventura, Juaquina Dorado, Montserrat El√≠as, Pepita Subirats, Esperanza Moreno, Maria Tomas and Paquita Manso. Most of these were already well known having served as milicianas during the war. More women were involved, but because of the clandestine nature of the CNT in the early Francoist period, their names have not been recorded in existing CNT papers.

With a 1972 melody by Johann Lauermann, it became a Christian hymn of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied (NGL), appearing from 1975 in German hymnals. It is popular, and is regarded as Zenetti's signature work.  History  Zenetti wrote the text in 1971, based on the biblical parable of The Grain of Wheat. With a 1972 melody by Johann Lauermann, it was included in the German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob of 1975 as GL 620, and in the 2013 edition as GL 210, designated as a song for communion or as thanks for communion. It was also printed in the Protestant hymnal of 1995 Evangelisches Gesangbuch, as EG 579, and in other songbooks. It is popular, and is regarded as Zenetti's signature work. The text was printed again in 2016 as part of a book Wie ein Traum, a collection of texts by Zenetti.  Text and theme  Zenetti based the text on The Grain of Wheat, a passage from the Gospel of John which says that the grain of wheat needs to die in order to bear fruit (). The poem is structured in four stanzas, each in four short lines, with the fourth of them rhyming with the second, followed by two equally short lines which are the same for all four stanzas: \\"Geheimnis des Glaubens: im Tod ist das Leben. (Mystery of faith: in death there is life.) The phrase \\"mystery of faith\\" is based on , which is quoted in the Eucharistic prayer during Mass. In the first stanza, the passage from John is applied to life among people: nobody can live alone. The second stanza mentions Jesus giving up his life as a gift, like bread. Those taking the bread (of the Eucharist) proclaim his death. The third stanza looks at those celebrating this mystery, and requests them to be \\"eaten\\" by the suffering of other people. The final stanza, saying \\"we\\" for the first time, requests that we are bread for others, living for each other, with only love counting (\\"und nur die Liebe z√§hlt\\").

Established in 1886, it was abolished for some period after 1901, but it was again created in Kingdom of Yugoslavia after 1918 as Kingdom of Serbia passed along insignia and military ranks to newly named state. It was a high rank for Yugoslav generals, inferior only to the Vojvoda. Yugoslav army generals commanded armies, group of armies and held position of Deputy Commander in Chief of the Yugoslav Armed Forces, Chief of the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force and Chief of the General Staff of the Royal Yugoslav Army. It was adopted and based on the similar French \\"commandant d'arm√©e\\" later known as \\"g√©n√©ral d'arm√©e \\" - Army general. Promotion and use This rank was usually given to Kingdom of Yugoslavia senior officers in the Ministry of Defense and General Staff and also used to promoted division generals under Law on the Organization of the Army and Navy from 19 July 1923http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:319906-General-nad- generalima and 1929 by law and Decree on army formations from 1936. It was used for army and air officers while navy had its own rank of Admiral that was equal to army general. In order to be promoted to army general an officer had previously to have finished higher Military Academy, had successfully commanded with divisional area or similar division formation one year, as division general commanded at least one year or had a position more important then division commander at least a year, had highest military degrees and it was capable of highest command in the opinion of senior officers or the defence minister. After the dissolution of King and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav People's Army did not used this rank immediately but one similar to this was created under the name of General of the army. Only a few people in the Yugoslav People's Army held the title of 4 star General of the army - Veljko Kadijeviƒá, Nikola Ljubiƒçiƒá, Kosta Naƒë and Ivan Go≈°njak.

It was given to Chief of the General Staff and commanders of army or army groups that usually had few division under them. Divisions in Kingdom of Yugoslavia particularly after 1930 had been 27-28000 strong and thus similar to some other army's corps.

Music Born in Giessen, and raised in Butzbach, both near Frankfurt, Stimming is a classically-trained musician; he played the violin, piano and drums at age ten. At sixteen, Stimming began producing electronic music, moving to Hamburg at nineteen to attend SAE Institute (School of Audio Engineering) where he did an Electronic Music Producer course. In 2006 Stimming met DJs and producers Solomun and Adriano who had just launched their label Diynamic that year. He started releasing under Diynamic, having to date released four albums with the label as well as multiple singles. Many of Stimming's releases under Diynamic are of a classically-informed nature, including analogue instrument samples such as the violin. Stimming's music has been characterized by ‚Äúheartstring-tugging tunes and acoustic feel.‚Äù In 2008, Stimming had his breakthrough hit, ‚ÄúUna Pena‚Äù, which contained worked vocals by the Chilean folklore-singer Violeta Parra.

Mitchell graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1951. Even though he had an interest in writing, his main motivation was to play baseball. The same year, he made his bid for the Florida Negro League, winning a spot with his beloved West Palm Beach team. In 1952, he pitched for the Florida Cubans based in Lakeland, Florida, home field and training center of the major league Detroit Tigers. Mitchell spent two seasons with the team, including a showdown with the Kansas City Monarchs and a highly touted prospect named Ernie Banks. After the game, Mitchell was approached by the Monarchs manager Buck O'Neil, who showed interest in his pitching abilities. Mitchell then was invited to throw batting practice to the Monarchs and earned a contract to join the team, which had a strong pitching staff featuring the legendary Satchel Paige. Mitchell debuted with the Monarchs in 1954 and made his first appearance against the Indianapolis Clowns, in which he gave them a taste of his fastball and his curveball. That was also the first start of his four-year career with the Kansas City club. In 1956, Mitchell asked the then manager Jelly Taylor to let him pitch the game that evening in Canada, something pitchers did not do. Then he would proceed to pitch a complete game victory while striking out 13 batters in his nine innings of work. He finished his Negro American League career with a 30-14 record. Afterwards, Mitchell retired in 1957 to marry his pregnant fianc√©. He then worked for Pratt & Whitney Aircraft United Technologies from 1964 to 1993. Yet Mitchell never forgot his former Negro League ballplayers, becoming an advocate for those men whose careers in the Negro Leagues did not pave the way for inclusion into organized baseball. In 1993, he successfully lobbied Major League Baseball for a pension plan for black players who were excluded after 1947, the year Jackie Robinson integrated white baseball, getting about 85 players were granted an annual pension. While some MLB teams added black players to their rosters during the decade after Robinson's breakthrough, most only signed one or two black players at a time. Those actions denied most Negro Leaguers the chance to show off their skills in the majors and also denied them the pensions afforded those players.Negro Leaguers to get their share. Sun Sentinel website. Retrieved on February 25, 2019. But Mitchell persevered and continued the fight for those who continued playing in the Negro Leagues ball after 1947. As a result, additional black players became eligible to receive supplementary financial assistance from MLB in 2004, including survivor benefits for widows and supplementary financial assistance. As of late 2003, 41 Negro Leagues players were drawing the annual $10,000 pension while supplying health insurance for an additional 34 Negro Leagues players and spouses, included in the separate 1993 deal. In his third attempt to aid Negro Leaguers, Mitchell managed to get MLB to finally decide that players on segregated black baseball teams in the late 1940s and 1950s were discriminated against because the so-called white leagues did not fully integrate until 1959. Mitchell received his due recognition in 2008, when he was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the MLB Special Draft of the surviving Negro League players.

Keshet is the leading figure in the struggle of the residents of South Tel Aviv against deportation of the African asylum seekers, and since the 1980s has been leading the protest movement against the Tel Aviv central bus station, which is located in the Neve Sha'anan neighborhood, contributing to crime, pollution, noise, overcrowding and drugs. She established Ahoti House, the headquarters of the Ahoti movement, which also serves as a community and culture center, information and educational center, art gallery, and more. She led the establishment of the Ahoti Fair trade store, which works to afford employment and income to women from marginalized communities. She founded the Libi BaMizrach (My Heart is in the East) festival of Mizrahi culture, and runs various other initiatives aimed at connecting between women from different oppressed communities, and providing them with the means for empowerment and relief ‚Äì social, political, and legal. Keshet's artwork centers upon her identity as a Mizrahi-feminist, and in her work as a curator and producer she brings together women of Arab ethnicity (whether Jewish, Muslim or Christian) and helps them tell their stories. In May 2018, Keshet was elected the chair of the neighborhood committee of Neve Sha'anan, and in November 2018 she was elected to the Tel Aviv city council.  Background  Keshet is the descendant of the Mashhadi Jews of Iran. She grew up, went to school and now works and lives in South Tel Aviv. Her grandmother, Hannah Kalati, was a community organizer, who established the \\"Mothers House\\" in South Tel Aviv, to provide elderly Mashadi women a safe space and social outlet. Her mother, Mazal Kashi, was a nurse, who worked for the welfare of neighborhood residents, making the rounds as a volunteer to provide everyone with free immunizations. Keshet received her teaching certification, and then, in the early 1980s, taught art at the art college of Ramat HaSharon. After that, she taught at several Tel Aviv-Jaffa primary and middle schools, while also offering art courses and workshops at community centers. In 1991, Keshet left teaching, and became the manager of the Milo Early Childhood Center in the Yad Eliyahu neighborhood of Tel Aviv. The center was created as a joint project by the municipality and the Ministry of Education. The center flourished, and she remained in this position for ten years. More than 1000 children from the distressed neighborhoods of South Tel Aviv visited the center every month, and were exposed to multi-disciplinary art and creativity. Keshet's formal art education had the opposite of the desired effect, and almost made her give up on being an artist. She felt that the accepted artistic discourse had nothing to do with her, and nothing to do with the society she lived and acted within ‚Äì but rather, reflected the hegemonic social discourse, highlighting European art and artists of European extraction, giving no space to Mizrahi, Arab, or other non-White art and artists. However, teaching art sparked her creativity anew, and she began making art once more. This was especially true after Keshet met Tikva Levy, with whom she began collaborating. One major project was establishment of an Art & Cinema project in the Mizrahi school system Levy managed. Keshet's social and political consciousness grew and took shape in these years, and the workshops and courses included in the program dealt with issues of identity, history, community as a cultural asset, gender, and politics.  Social and political activism  Keshet's life work to create social change spans over three decades, taking place at the social and cultural peripheries of Israel. She works at the points of intersection where women from different marginalized communities meet: Mizrahis, Palestinians, immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Ethiopians, asylum seekers, and work migrants. From this vantage point, Keshet is one of the leading influences on the growth of the feminist discourse that recognizes the effects of multiple oppressions, including those based on gender, ethnicity, culture, economic class, geographic location and access to resources; and also the introduction of this discourse into the hegemonic, White feminism. Keshet's credo, upon which her activism is based, can be summarized as follows: \\"The situation of women of color in distressed areas will always be worse than that of both men and women from the hegemonic social group, and if we leave the struggle to the establishment or to hegemonic groups, we will continue to be viewed as a community in need of rehabilitation. The phenomenon of people coming from the outside to help poor and miserable people is how the hegemony preserves this social situation. The money that comes from the establishment or from philanthropic foundations of wealthy Ashkenazim will go to their representatives ‚Äì again, those with external power ‚Äì and they will decide where the money goes. They see us, the original inhabitants of the neighborhood, as incapable of managing this money and directing it to the real needs of the residents of the neighborhood.\\"  Ahoti ‚Äì for Women in Israel  In 2000, Keshet was one of the founders of the Ahoti ‚Äì for Women in Israel movement (known as Ahoti ([my] sister)), and has headed it ever since. The movement is an aggregation of social justice initiatives of various types, all of which center on marginalized women. Projects led by Keshet include: Ahoti House: Keshet is the conceiver and founder Ahoti House ‚Äì a cultural and community center for the Ahoti movement and for residents of South Tel Aviv neighborhoods. The center was established in 2005, and provides a physical space for women of different backgrounds to engage in dialog, as a creative space and gallery, and as an educational space where lectures, workshops and courses related to Mizrahi feminism and women's issue are conducted. Ahoti Fair Trade Shop: The store is the first and only one of its kind in the Middle East. It was established in 2009, and operates in collaboration with 16 social organizations throughout Israel. The store employs women in accordance with fair employment practices, and sells the handiwork of over 200 craftswomen from various cultural backgrounds, enabling them to cater to new markets, without the costs of advertising or middlemen. Black Night events: The \\"Black Night of Culture\\" in an annual protest and celebration started in 2012. It is organized by Keshet in cooperation with other social activists as a counterpoint to the municipal \\"White Night\\" event. ‚Äì created to celebrate the culture of the \\"White City\\" (as Tel Aviv is called, and designated by UNESCO) ‚Äì which Mizrahi activists claim in ironically apt: The designated neighborhoods are in central and northern Tel Aviv (mostly Ashkenazi), while the southern neighborhoods (mostly Mizrahi or immigrant) are not represented, included and in fact, act, as the activists call it \\"as the garbage dump of the White City\\", to which the prostitution, drug trade, and bus pollution are directed. Aheta Center: In 2006, Keshet and Lakia Yardeny founded the Aheta Center (Aheta is \\"sister\\" in Amharic), a cultural and occupational center for Ethiopian women in Kiryat Gat, with the goal of enabling economic empowerment for this marginalized group. The women create and sell traditional pottery, embroidery and weaving. Women's National Network: Ongoing collaborations among women's groups representing marginalized communities, and between them and the business sector. In 2006, Keshet initiated the \\"Women Creating a Feminist Economy\\" project, fostering economic empowerment and entrepreneurship, based on mutual accountability.  South Tel Aviv activism  South Tel Aviv Against Expulsion: Keshet is the driving force behind this movement that objects to the plan by the Israeli government to deport African asylum seekers. According to Keshet, the government's policy is to incite conflict between different oppressed groups, in this case the veteran Mizrahi residents of South Tel Aviv and the African newcomers, thereby reducing the value of real estate in the neighborhood. Once one \\"problem\\" group is eliminated, the Mizrahi residents would be next ‚Äì and the real estate would then be awarded to developers and tycoons for their own financial benefit, and that of their cronies in local government, but not to the residents. The neighborhood is already being gentrified at its margins, and according to Keshet, the future is not a mystery, but is already taking place. The movement's struggle reached its peak at the start of 2018, when the government announced its deportation plan. Among the many activities that were sparked at this time, a rally was held in February, which drew over 20,000 participants. The fight against the Tel Aviv central bus station: The central bus station in Tel Aviv is one of the most serious environmental and social hazards in the history of the State of Israel. At the end of the 1980s, Keshet established an action committee of Neve Sha'anan residents, who combated the placement of this health and life quality hazard in their neighborhood through the courts, lobbying the Knesset and the municipal authority, bringing the struggle to public awareness through demonstrations, protests and media activity. The struggle led to the compensation settlement for hundreds of residents. Keshet continues to lead new groups of residents in this effort. Levinsky tent protest: During the 2011 Israeli social justice protests, Keshet began the \\"Roar of the South\\" protest, establishing a tent encampment in Levinsky Park in South Tel Aviv, mirroring the main tent city of Rothschild Boulevard. The purpose was to emphasize that the housing and cost of living protest in the north of the city did not represent the needs and narratives of the south side, and that the middle- class protest could not be considered a collective protest, as it was depicted, and that social justice cannot be achieved without accounting for those most in need. The site encompassed protest, community and culture, as events, music, discussion circles, parties and more took place around the clock. The police repeatedly dismantled the encampment, and each time, activists rebuilt it. The site quickly became a relief center for those in need ‚Äì it welcomed the homeless of the area, Arab migrant workers needing a place to sleep, African asylum seekers seeking food and shelter, Filipino foreign workers, and more. The protest was based on non-violence, and both the residents and activists represented a wide swathe of Israel's social groups: Single mothers, transgender sex workers, Ethiopian Jews, children, the elderly, Mizrahi, Asian, European and so on. The encampment remained in place until October 3, 2011, when dozens of police and city inspectors arrived in force to dismantle it a final time. Power to the Community: Following a wave of viol2011 Israeli social justice protestsence against African asylum seekers in South Tel Aviv, which also targeted Ethiopian citizens of Israel due to the color of their skin, in 2012 Keshet organized a series of public meetings that brought together veteran residents of Neve Sha'anan and newly arrived asylum seekers. The meetings let to the establishment of the organization \\"Koach LaKehila\\", or \\"Power to the Community\\", a multicultural and inclusive movement to stop the deterioration of the neighborhood and increase its safety. The group conducted safety patrols, engaged in dialog, offered relief services to individuals, and held community cultural and protest events.  Mizrahi Cultural Activism  My Heart Is in the East: Keshet founded the Libi BaMizrach (My Heart Is in the East) Coalition in 2009 together with several other Mizrahi activists, as an umbrella group with over 20 member organizations, as well as activists, academics, and artists from Israel and abroad, who have influence or are responsible for cultural, social or political agendas. The coalition is the first and only one of its kind in Israel, especially as relates to the Mizrahi struggle. Its goal is to be a driving force and effect change in the country, in particular through multicultural dialog, activities at the highest levels of the Ministry of Culture, releasing annual reports on resource distribution, and highlighting and celebrating Mizrahi culture.  Writing, documentation, and production  One of the central strategies for change promoted by Keshet is the distribution of knowledge that usually does not make its way into the canon of Israeli culture. Based on the belief that women's voices, and especially those from marginalized communities, are important to Israeli society, Keshet has built various systems to ensure that this knowledge is made widely available. For example, the anthology To My Sister ‚Äì Mizrahi Feminism in Israel (2007) combines poetry, essays, research, speeches and prose written by a wide variety of women from marginalized communities, academia, from distressed neighborhoods, from the geographic periphery, social activists, and more; The report \\"Racism and Sexism in the Media ‚Äì The Test Case of the Elections for the 19th Knesset\\" (2013) documented racist and sexist coverage of the elections from a feminist perspective. The report was released in English, Hebrew and Arabic; In 2012, Ahoti published From A to Z: A Dictionary of Peace by Women in Israel, the culmination of a 3-year project by 60 Jewish Israeli and Arab women from South Tel Aviv, Rahat, Yehud and Kfar Kara, who each contributed her personal perspective on peace. The book, which includes both prose and poetry, was translated from Hebrew into Arabic and vice versa, as needed. Keshet also publishes books and catalogs of her artistic work: The book and art exhibit \\"Women Creating Change\\" (Nashim Meshanot ‚Äì 2009) documents the work of women from various feminist-activist settings; \\"Black Work\\" (Avoda Shchora ‚Äì 2010) is a project and catalog of an exhibit first shown in the eSel Museum of Vienna, and the Barbour Gallery of Jerusalem. The exhibit curated works contrasting the world of labor with that of high art, together with the worlds of activism and corrective economy; Mizrahi and Palestinian Women in the Visual Arts deals with the interactions between Mizrahi and Palestinian culture in Israel through art and visual creation. The book displays the work of 34 artists working in various media, accompanied by essays by leading Mizrahi and Palestinian theorists.  Art  Keshet is a Mizrahi feminist artist and art curator, envisioning and producing exhibits since the 1990s. She is the first curator in Israel to display, through art, the interconnection of identity and gender in the art of Mizrahi women, and to visually connect Mizrahi feminist activism and art. One of Keshet's primary goals as a curator and producer is to create spaces in which to show Mizrahi art, as well as art from other groups ‚Äì such as Palestinian and Ethiopian women ‚Äì which has been long absent from the mainstream of Israeli art, and to make the art accessible to various communities, including in the geographic peripheries, as opposed to the mainstream that exists in the affluent, largely-Ashkenazi center of the country. She also publishes books and catalogs of the exhibitions so that they will be documented and accessible in the long term. Keshet's own art reflects these same ideas, and seeks to spark new discourses about Israeli society. She works in multiple media, and is particularly known for her micrography, and has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions.  Solo Exhibitions  * \\"Mother's House\\" (Beit Em), Jerusalem Artists House, March 2004 A collection of portraits of women from Keshet's family, side by side with illustrations of fictional women.

While attending TED Ankara College Foundation Schools, she was sent to a modeling and grace school by her mother. Then she left her studies in economics at the Ankara Academy of Economics and Commercial Sciences unfinished and began modeling in Istanbul. She would describe this decision as \\"my greatest regret\\" in the years to come. She played in many commercials during that period. She made her acting debut in 1985 with the role of N√ºzhet on TRT's series Dokuzuncu Hariciye Koƒüu≈üu. She also started to work as a TV presenter in the 1980s. In 1989, Kumbasar married Turkish actor and showman Mehmet Ali Erbil. In 1995, she gave birth to the couple's daughter Yasmin. They divorced in 1996.

The building features a large central dome and 102 smaller concrete domes decorated with Islamic calligraphy depicting the 99 names of Allah. The mosque's use of exposed concrete has been likened to Brutalism, although some have pushed back against the distinction. The project originally began in 1996 when the Muslim community purchased three neighboring properties to replace a rented space. Gaining approval for the project took a total 17 years; the process was delayed significantly by objection from local government officials. Construction on the building was further delayed due to the discovery of a water table, continued objection from the Canterbury council, and difficulty gaining visas for calligraphers scheduled to decorate the building. The building received the 2018 Sir John Sulman Medal.

The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)-C45 was launched on 1 April 2019 with a payload of 29 satellites, including one for electronic intelligence,along with 28 customer satellites from other countries. Details The PSLV-C45 was launched from the second launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra pradesh,India. The PSLV C45 rocket carried primary payloads like EMISAT and secondary payloads like M6P, Bluewalker1, four Lemur-2 out of a total of thirty satellites. EMISAT is developed by DRDO. The EMISAT satellite is based on the IMS-2 bus inherited from SARAL. The nature of the payload has not been officially confirmed. It was the first flight of PSLV-QL, having 4 strap-on boosters and placed a primary payload EMISAT and a secondary payload of multiple cubesats, for example 4 Lemur-2 satellites and the M6P satellite, in sun-synchronous orbits.  Uniqueness of the project  PSLV C45 as seen from launch view gallery The specialty of this mission is that for the first time PSLV will launch satellites in Three different orbits. Another distinguished feature of the project is for the first time, PSLV with four strap-on configuration has been identified for this mission. Until now, PSLV has been in either two or six strap-on configuration or without any strap-ons. Third uniqueness in this mission as it is the first PSLV fourth stage (PS4) that uses solar panels to support payloads hosted on it. Sequence of launch Mission starts with the Launching of the satellite EMISAT into orbit at 780 km, then it will inject 29 satellites into orbit at 504 km and later the fourth stage will move to 485 km orbit to carry out scientific experiments. The launch was originally scheduled for 21 March 2019, but was delayed to 1 April \\"to ensure system readiness for a perfect launch\\". Mission overview * Propellant: **Stage 1: Composite Solid ** Stage 2: Earth Storable Liquid ** Stage 3: Composite Solid ** Stage 4: Earth Storable Liquid * Altitude: The PSLV C45 rocket had four stages; each one was self-contained, with its own propulsion system, thereby capable of functioning independently. The first and third stages used composite solid propellants, while the second stage used earth-storable liquid propellant and fourth one fitted with Solar Panels.
