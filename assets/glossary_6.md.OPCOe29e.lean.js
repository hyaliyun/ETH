Ed Monk, Sr.) (Jan 1, 1894 - Port Blakely, Bainbridge Island, Washington,Ed Monk and the Tradition of Classic Boats by Bet Oliver, pg. 1 to Jan 21, 1973) was a shipwright and naval architect in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. He was active from 1914 to 1973. He designed pleasure and commercial vessels, both power and sail. MV Savona, a 40' bridge-deck cruiser, moored at South Lake Union, Seattle, WA, an example of an Ed Monk, Sr., boat design, from 1942.

MV Thunderbird, 40', an example of an Ed Monk, Sr., boat design, from 1959.  Shipwright, 1914 to 1925  Ed Monk, Sr., began his boat building career in 1914 as an apprentice working on Robert Moran's schooner San Juan, under construction on Orcas Island. In 1915, Monk worked with his father again in St. Helens, OR, building The City of Portland, \\"one of the largest wooden freighters ever built.\\" He continued to work for his father at Meacham and Babcock, a boatyard started in Seattle, WA, during World War I to build twelve wooden freighters for the US Government. During this time, he became more interested in designing boats and began studying toward that end. Meacham and Babcock closed in 1919. Monk continued to work at various boatyards in Seattle and eventually found his way to the Blanchard Boat Co. in 1925. He was hired as a shipwright, but soon began to design small boats. His first large cruiser design, the 62 foot motor yacht Silver King, was built there in 1925  Naval architect, 1925 to 1973  At Blanchard Boat Co., Monk got to know the naval architect L. E. \\"Ted\\" Geary and in 1926, Geary hired Monk as a draftsman. In 1930, Monk followed Geary to Long Beach, CA. In 1933, Monk quit working directly for Geary and moved back to Washington state. Monk maintained his association with Geary as his local representative. Monk began his independent career as a naval architect by designing and building his \\"Plan No. 1,\\" the 50 ft. bridge-deck cruiser Nan, which became his home for seven years, moored at the Seattle Yacht Club, and was briefly his office. His designs were built by many of the Pacific Northwest builders like Blanchard Boat Co., Grandy Boat Co., Jensen Motor Boat, Chambers and Franck, Forder Boatworks, McQueen Boat Works, and Tollycraft among others. Ed Monk, Sr., wrote two books on boat building: # Monk, Edwin, Small Boat Building, 1934, revised 1947, published by Charles Scribner's Sons, New York # Monk, Edwin, Modern Boat Building, 1939, revised 1949 and 1973, published by Charles Scribner's Sons, New York Monk designed commercial vessels which included tugs and cargo carriers. He also designed the \\"Super Shrimp Trapper (SST)\\" Mimi for Ivar Haglund, launched in 1967. Monk continued to design boats up until his death in 1973 at the age of 79. He had \\"produced more than 3,000 boat designs ranging from 6 foot dinghies to yachts and workboats in the 150 foot range.\\" Ed Monk, Sr., designed and built both sailboats & powerboats: ;Sailing Yachts Aries,50 feet, launched 1941 #Aries, 50 feet, launched 1941 #Mariner III, 42 feet, launched 1941 #Symra, 43 feet, launched 1941 #Cumulus, 26 feet, launched 1947 #Bendora, launched 1948 #Halcyon, launched 1948 #Netha, 45 feet, launched 1936 #Madwenowe, launched 1967 #Mikay IV, 46 feet, launched 1959 #Moonraker, 50 feet, launched 1962 #Sea Witch, 29 feet, launched 1939 #Moonsail, 32 feet, launched 1946 ;Motor Yachts The Carol M., designed by Ed Monk and built in 1948 by Grandy Boat Works on Lake Union, Seattle, Washington. 30' overall length, 40' deck, 11' beam, 3' draft # Ann Saunders, 32 feet, launched 1926 # Nan, 50 feet, launched 1934 # Port Madison Gal, 24 feet, launched ca. 1940 # Western Maid I, 40 feet, launched 1946 # Western Maid II, 42 feet, launched 1947 # Duffy, 35 feet, launched 1950 # Alerion, 42 feet, launched ca. 1952 # Whim, 37 feet, launched ca. 1957 # Tatoosh, 40 feet, launched 1959 # Nika Sia, 46 feet, launched 1965 # Tryphena, 50 feet, launched 1970  References  External links  * Ed Monk Wooden Boat Club * Classic Yacht Association List of Current Motor Yachts Designed by Ed Monk, Sr. * Nan 1894 births 1973 deaths Architects from Seattle Boat and ship designers American yacht designers American shipwrights ","title":"Ed Monk"},{"id":"38672962","text":"The Municipality of Ilirska Bistrica (; ) is a municipality in Slovenia.

History Slidepad was started by Riley and Ouellet while students at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Ouellet received inspiration for the product after he crashed his bicycle when applying too much pressure on his front brakes, resulting in front wheel lockup. In 2009, Riley and Ouellet entered their initial design in Cal Poly’s Business Plan competition and won 1st place.New Company Launches Brake System. Bicycle Retailer and Industry News. February 25, 2011. In 2013 Alan Nordin, former president of Fallbrook Technologies' bicycle division, joined the company as an executive advisor.

Description Slidepad is an Intelligent Brake Distribution (IBD) technology, aimed at making braking easier for novice or casual cyclists, integrates into V-brake systems to provide single-lever braking. It modulates the front brake force in real time, based on the road surface and rider weight position, and avoids front wheel lockup accidents when applying the front brake.Reid, Carlton. Single lever break system gets Asian production slot. Bike Biz. June 8, 2011. It was designed to prevent riders from flipping over their handlebars when applying the front brake. Once the brake pads make contact with the rear wheel, the Slidepad slides forward, which pulls a cable that is connected to the front brakes. Similar to the anti-lock brake system in cars, the mechanism prevents the front wheel from locking, no matter how hard the brake is pressed or how slippery the road conditions are.Overholt, Zach.

The building occupies a full 1.7 acre city block formerly known as the Webster Block, directly across from and connected to the KeyBank Center and Canalside. The building is also located near the southern terminus of the Erie Canal Harbor (Metro Rail) station. The development features retail and restaurant space, a 205-room Buffalo Marriott Harborcenter Hotel, as well as two hockey rinks that are the home of the Buffalo Jr. Sabres of the Ontario Junior Hockey League, the Canisius Golden Griffins of the NCAA, and the Erie Kats of the National Junior College Athletic Association. The rinks are also used as the Buffalo Sabres practice facility. Construction The beginning concept for the building, specifically the dual ice rinks and parking garage combo came after Buffalo Sabres chief development officer Cliff Benson led a group of team officials to Washington, D.C. to view the Washington Capitals practice facility, the Kettler Capitals Iceplex. The complex, which is built on top of a parking garage, has seating for 1,200, a training center, proshop, and is home to many area teams. This trip helped the group form their ideas. Originally just planned to be two hockey rinks on top of a parking garage, the hotel and restaurant concepts were later added to the plan by Terry Pegula's wife, Kim Pegula.http://www.harborcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HARBORCENTER- GroundUp.pdf Construction of the 20-story Harborcenter began in March 2013, the same month the Webster Block was purchased from the City of Buffalo for $2.2 million. The building was built by Mortenson Construction with ICON Venue Group serving as the project manager. The building's hockey rink portion topped out on June 25, 2014, as the last structural beam for the hotel was put into place. Building construction was completed on the whole building in August 2015. The rinks and restaurants opened on October 31 and November 6, 2014. The hotel opened on August 27, 2015. Operations Harborcenter was financed by Buffalo Sabres owner Terry Pegula and is owned by the Pegula's company Pegula Sports and Entertainment. The building contains indoor parking for 750 vehicles, and features two NHL regulation indoor ice rinks on the building's sixth floor, one with an 1,800-seat capacity and the other with a 150-seat capacity. IMPACT Sports Performance owned by the Pegulas operates HARBORCENTER's 5,000 square foot, high performance off-ice training facility located on the building's 6th floor. The building also contains a classroom and RapidShot Hockey Training System. The development is one of the most expensive for any privately funded single building in the city of Buffalo history. The project is designed to achieve LEED certification, with a goal of LEED Silver. The building was pledged by Pegula and others involved upon obtaining the property to open at the time by September 2014 making it one of the faster projects in the area. On September 10, 2019, Pegula Sports and Entertainment reached a 10-year naming rights agreement for the building with Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM).

A Statue of Tim Horton was dedicated across the street the same day. The building also contains a pro shop. The building also has storefronts along Main Street known as The Shops at HarborCanter for smaller street front tenants which are expected to be leased out. The first store that opened in Harborcenter was Red Siren, which is a women's specialty store. It features gifts, jewelry, leather and clothing not currently found in the Buffalo area. Red Siren opened in the Summer of 2015, around the time when the Mariott Harborcenter Hotel opened. Other stores include Modern Nostalgia, Fowler's Chocolates and Clayton's Toys & Gifts. It was announced in July 2016 that Modern Nostalgia would be leaving Harborcenter. They were replaced by Healthy Scratch, a quick-serve restaurant and boutique operated by Kelly and Jessica Pegula. Clayton's, Fowler's and Red Siren all announced their departure from Harborcenter in September 2017, with employees citing slow sales and inconsistent traffic for their departure.https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2017/08/10/harborcenter- loses-three-retailers-after-two-years.html In May 2015, it was announced that Advanced Care Physical Therapy will lease space inside Impact Sports Performance, located inside the Harborcenter.

The couple are required to present more poses and in the process fall in love. When Gregory leaves the caves, Urvashi and Chandra consummate their relationship. However, they are caught by the sculptor, who hits Chandra on the head with a hammer. A fire occurs in the cave and kills Chandra, while the sculptor takes the girl away. In a modern time, the 1990s, in India, a local prince marries Reeta, a local girl (later revealed to be a reincarnation of Urvashi). Meanwhile, Jeff, an architect in the US, (later revealed to be the reincarnation of Chandra) has frequent nightmares about a sculptor killing him. He visits India on a trip to a recently discovered archaeological site, the cave where the sculptor Gregory worked and where Chandra was killed. While in India, Jeff bonds with Reeta, the new princess, without knowing that she was his lover some centuries ago. The prince is a womaniser and has multiple affairs. He also mistreats the princess. The princess and the architect fall in love. While visiting the archaeological site, the two realise that this is the same site where they consummated their love in their past lives. They once again consummate their new-found love for each other. During this act, the prince comes to the site. The prince is shown to be somewhat of a reincarnation of the sculptor. He hits the architect. The architect and the princess overpower the prince and he is killed, allowing the lovers to reunite. However, a minor earthquake results in the entrance to the caves being closed and the lovers to be trapped inside. As they accept their fate, the princess says, \\"A few moments of love is better than a lifetime without it\\", to which the architect replies, \\"Chandra and Urvashi will never die\\", implying that they are content with dying together, having each other at long last.

Alternative terms are also in use, such as additive construction, Autonomous Robotic Construction System (ARCS), Large scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM), or Freeform construction (FC), also to refer to sub-groups, such as '3D Concrete', used to refer to concrete extrusion technologies. There are a variety of 3D printing methods used at construction scale, with the main ones being extrusion (concrete/cement, wax, foam, polymers), powder bonding (polymer bond, reactive bond, sintering), and additive welding. 3D printing at a construction scale will have a wide variety of applications within the private, commercial, industrial and public sectors. Potential advantages of these technologies include faster construction, lower labor costs, increased complexity and/or accuracy, greater integration of function, and less waste produced. A number of different approaches have been demonstrated to date, which include on-site and off-site fabrication of buildings and construction components, using industrial robots, gantry systems and tethered autonomous vehicles. Demonstrations of construction 3D printing technologies to date have included fabrication of housing, construction components (cladding and structural panels and columns), bridges and civil infrastructure, artificial reefs, follies, and sculptures. The technology has seen a significant increase in popularity in recent years with many new companies, including some backed by prominent names from the construction industry and academia. This led to several important milestones, such as the first 3D printed building, the first 3D printed bridge, the first 3D printed part in a public building, the first living 3D printed building in Europe and CIS, and the first 3D printed building in Europe fully approved by the authorities (COBOD International), among many others. History=Seeding technologies 1950–1995= Robotic bricklaying was conceptualized and explored in the 1950s and related technology development around automated construction began in the 1960s, with pumped concrete and isocyanate foams. Development of automated fabrication of entire buildings using slip forming techniques and robotic assembly of components, akin to 3D printing, were pioneered in Japan to address the dangers of building high rise buildings by Shimizu and Hitachi in the 1980s and 1990s. Many of these early approaches to on-site automation foundered because of the construction 'bubble', their inability to respond to novel architectures and the problems of feeding and preparing materials to the site in built up areas. =Early developments 1995–2000= Early construction 3D printing development and research have been under way since 1995. Two methods were invented, one by Joseph PegnaJ.B.Gardiner PhD Thesis - Exploring the Emerging Design Territory of Construction 3D Printing (p80), 2011 which was focused on a sand/cement forming technique which utilized steam to selectively bond the material in layers or solid parts, though this technique was never demonstrated. The second technique, Contour Crafting by Behrohk Khoshnevis, initially began as a novel ceramic extrusion and shaping method, as an alternative to the emerging polymer and metal 3D printing techniques, and was patented in 1995.Khoshnevis, Original Contour Crafting Patent US5529471 A Khoshnevis realized that this technique could exceed these techniques where \\"current methods are limited to fabrication of part dimensions that are generally less than one meter in each dimension\\". Around 2000, Khoshnevis's team at USC Vertibi began to focus on construction scale 3D printing of cementitious and ceramic pastes, encompassing and exploring automated integration of modular reinforcement, built-in plumbing and electrical services, within one continuous build process. This technology has only been tested at lab scale to date and controversially and allegedly formed the basis for recent efforts in China. =First generation 2000–2010= In 2003, Rupert Soar secured funding and formed the freeform construction group at Loughborough University, UK, to explore the potential for up-scaling existing 3D printing techniques for construction applications. Early work identified the challenge of reaching any realistic break-even for the technology at the scale of construction and highlighted that there could be ways into the application by massively increasing the value proposition of integrated design (many functions, one component). In 2005, the group secured funding to build a large-scale construction 3D printing machine using 'off the shelf' components (concrete pumping, spray concrete, gantry system) to explore how complex such components could be and realistically meet the demands for construction. In 2005 Enrico Dini, Italy, patented the D-Shape technology, employing a massively scaled powder jetting/bonding technique over an area approximately 6m x 6m x 3m.Patent by Dini et. al, \\"Method and Device for Building Automatically Conglomerate Structures.

The mould casting surface is then 5 axis milled removing approximately 5mm of wax to create a high quality mould (approximately 20 micron surface roughness). After the component has cured, the mould is then either crushed or melted-off and the wax filtered and re- used, significantly reducing waste compared to conventional mould technologies. The benefits of the technology are fast mould fabrication speeds, increased production efficiencies, reduced labour and virtual elimination of waste by re-use of materials for bespoke moulds compared to conventional mould technologies.\\"http://www.iaarc.org/publications/fulltext/ISARC2016-Paper095.pdf, ISARC 2016\\" The system was originally demonstrated in 2014 using an industrial robot.

The technology has been used to fabricate a backyard scale version of a castle and a hotel room in the Philippines The world's first serial production of construction printers was launched by SPECAVIA company, based in Yaroslavl (Russia). In May 2015, the company introduced the first model of a construction 3d printer and announced the start of sales. As of the beginning of 2018 the group of companies \\"AMT-SPEСAVIA\\" produces 7 models of portal construction printers: from small format (for printing small architectural forms) to large scale (for printing buildings up to 3 floors) printers. Today, the construction 3D printers of Russian production under the \\"AMT\\" trademark are operating in several countries, including, in August 2017 the first construction printer was delivered to Europe - for 3DPrinthuset (Denmark). This printer was used Copenhagen for the construction of the first 3D printed building in the EU (office-hotel of 50 m2). XtreeE has developed a multi- component printing system, mounted on top of a 6-axis robotic arm. The project has started in July 2015, and boasts collaboration and investments from strong names in the construction industry, such as Saint Gobain, Vinci, and LafargeHolcim. 3DPrinthuset, a successful Danish 3DPrinting startup, has also branched into construction with its sister company COBOD International, which made its own gantry-based printer in October 2017. With the collaboration of strong names in the scandinavian region, such as NCC and Force Technology, the company's spin-off has quickly gained traction by constructing the first 3DPrinted house in Europe. The Building on Demand (BOD) project, as the structure is called, is a small office hotel in Copenhagen, Nordhavn area, with walls and part of the foundation fully printed, while the rest of the construction is made in traditional construction. As of November 2017, the building is in the final phase of applying fixtures and roofing, while all the 3DPrinted parts have been fully completed. SQ4D was recognized as the best 3D homebuilder of 2019 with its first of its kind unlimited footprint design S-Squared ARCS VVS NEPTUNE with its Gantry system 9.1 x 4.4 x ∞ from the United States.https://www.aniwaa.com/house-3d-printer-construction/ S-Squared 3D Printers Inc is a 3D printer manufacturing and retail company based in Long Island, New York. The company was founded in 2014 and makes 3D printers for hobbyists, libraries and STEM programs. In 2017, the company launched a new division, S-Squared 4D Commercial, to construct homes and commercial buildings with their 3D printing rig called Autonomous Robotic Construction System (ARCS). This bootstrapped company is co-founded by Robert Smith and Mario Szczepanski and has 13 employees. Autonomous Robotic Construction System (ARCS) is a 20-feet by 40-feet eco-friendly concrete printer that can build a 1,490-square-foot home in 36 hours. The system can build homes, commercial buildings, roads and bridges. ARCS can complete projects from 500 square feet to more than one million square feet. Design Architect James Bruce Gardiner pioneered architectural design for Construction 3D Printing with two projects. The first Freefab Tower 2004 and the second Villa Roccia 2009–2010. FreeFAB Tower (pp. 176–202), 2011 was based on the original concept to combine a hybrid form of construction 3D printing with modular construction. This was the first architectural design for a building focused on the use of Construction 3D Printing. Influences can be seen in various designs used by Winsun, including articles on the Winsun's original press release and office of the future. The FreeFAB Tower project also depicts the first speculative use of multi-axis robotic arms in construction 3D printing, the use of such machines within construction has grown steadily in recent years with projects by MX3D and Branch Technology. The Villa Roccia 2009–2010 (p203-279), 2011 took this pioneering work a step further with the a design for a Villa at Porto Rotondo, Sardinia, Italy in collaboration with D-Shape. The design for the Villa focused on the development of a site specific architectural language influenced by the rock formations on the site and along the coast of Sardinia, while also taking into account the use of a panellised prefabricated 3D printing process. The project went through prototyping and didn't proceed to full construction. Francios Roche (R&Sie;) developed the exhibition project and monograph 'I heard about' in 2005 which explored the use of a highly speculative self propelling snake like autonomous 3D printing apparatus and generative design system to create high rise residential towers. The project although impossible to put into practice with current or contemporary technology demonstrated a deep exploration of the future of design and construction. The exhibition showcased large scale CNC milling of foam and rendering to create the freeform building envelopes envisaged. Dutch architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars's performative architecture 3D-printed building was planned to be built by a partnership of Dutch companies. The house was planned to be built in the end of 2014, but this deadline wasn't met. The companies have said that they are still committed to the project. The Building On Demand, or BOD, a small office hotel 3D printed by 3D Printhuset (now COBOD International) and designed by architect Ana Goidea, has incorporated curved walls and a rippling effects on their surface, to showcase the design freedom that 3D printing allows in the horizontal plane.  Structures = 3D printed buildings= Europe’s first 3D-printed residential house The 3D Print Canal House was the first full-scale construction project of its kind to get off the ground. In just a short space of time, the Kamermaker has been further developed to increase its production speed by 300%. However, progress has not been swift enough to claim the title of 'World's First 3D Printed House'. The first residential building in Europe and the CIS, constructed using the 3D printing construction technology, was the home in Yaroslavl (Russia) with the area of 298,5 sq. meters. The walls of the building were printed by the company SPECAVIA in December 2015. 600 elements of the walls were printed in the shop and assembled at the construction site. After completing the roof structure and interior decoration, the company presented a fully finished 3D building in October 2017. The peculiarity of this project is that for the first time in the world the entire technological cycle of construction has been passed: # design, # obtaining a building permit, # registration of the building, # connection of all engineering systems. An important feature of the 3D house in Yaroslavl, that also distinguishes this project from other implemented ones - this is not a presentation structure, but rather a full- fledged residential building. Today it is home of a real, ordinary, family. Dutch and Chinese demonstration projects are slowly constructing 3D-printed buildings in China, Dubai and the Netherlands. Using the effort to educate the public to the possibilities of the new plant-based building technology and to spur greater innovation in 3D printing of residential buildings.The plan to print actual houses shows off the best and worst of 3D printing (2014-06-26), James Robinson, PandoDaily A small concrete house was 3D-printed in 2017. The Building on Demand (BOD), the first 3D printed house in Europe, is a project led by COBOD International (formerly known as 3DPrinthuset, now its sister company) for a small 3D printed office hotel in Copenhagen, Nordhavn area. The building is also the first 3D printed permanent building, with all permits in place and fully approved by the authorities. As of 2018, the building stands fully completed and furbished. = 3D printed bridges = In Spain, the first pedestrian bridge printed in 3D in the world (3DBRIDGE) was inaugurated 14 December 2016 in the urban park of Castilla-La Mancha in Alcobendas, Madrid. The 3DBUILD technology used was developed by ACCIONA, who was in charge of the structural design, material development and manufacturing of 3D printed elements. The bridge has a total length of 12 meters and a width of 1.75 meters and is printed in micro-reinforced concrete. Architectural design was done by Institute of Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC). The 3D printer used to build the footbridge was manufactured by D-Shape. The 3D printed bridge reflects the complexities of nature’s forms and was developed through parametric design and computational design, which allows to optimize the distribution of materials and allows to maximize the structural performance, being able to dispose the material only where it is needed, with total freedom of forms. The 3D printed footbridge of Alcobendas represented a milestone for the construction sector at international level, as large scale 3D printing technology has been applied in this project for the first time in the field of civil engineering in a public space. = 3D printed architectural forms = In August 2018 in Palekh (old town in Russia) was the world's first application of additive technology for сreating the fountain. The fountain \\"Snop\\" (Sheaf) was originally created in the middle of the 20th century by famous sculptor Nikolai Dydykin. Nowadays, during the restoration of the fountain, it was changed from a rectangular to a round shape. The backlight system has also been updated. The renovated fountain now is 26 meters in diameter and 2.2 meters deep. The parapet of the 3D fountain with internal communication channels was printed by the AMT construction printer produced by AMT-SPETSAVIA group. =Extraterrestrial printed structures= The printing of buildings has been proposed as a particularly useful technology for constructing off-Earth habitats, such as habitats on the Moon or Mars. , the European Space Agency was working with London-based Foster + Partners to examine the potential of printing lunar bases using regular 3D printing technology. The architectural firm proposed a building-construction 3D-printer technology in January 2013 that would use lunar regolith raw materials to produce lunar building structures while using enclosed inflatable habitats for housing the human occupants inside the hardshell printed lunar structures. Overall, these habitats would require only ten percent of the structure mass to be transported from Earth, while using local lunar materials for the other 90 percent of the structure mass. The dome-shaped structures would be a weight- bearing catenary form, with structural support provided by a closed-cell structure, reminiscent of bird bones. In this conception, \\"printed\\" lunar soil will provide both \\"radiation and temperature insulation\\" for the Lunar occupants. The building technology mixes lunar material with magnesium oxide which will turn the \\"moonstuff into a pulp that can be sprayed to form the block\\" when a binding salt is applied that \\"converts [this] material into a stone-like solid.\\" A type of sulfur concrete is also envisioned. Tests of 3D printing of an architectural structure with simulated lunar material have been completed, using a large vacuum chamber in a terrestrial lab. The technique involves injecting the binding liquid under the surface of the regolith with a 3D printer nozzle, which in tests trapped -scale droplets under the surface via capillary forces. The printer used was the D-Shape. A variety of lunar infrastructure elements have been conceived for 3D structural printing, including landing pads, blast protection walls, roads, hangars and fuel storage. In early 2014, NASA funded a small study at the University of Southern California to further develop the Contour Crafting 3D printing technique. Potential applications of this technology include constructing lunar structures of a material that could consist of up to 90-percent lunar material with only ten percent of the material requiring transport from Earth. NASA is also looking at a different technique that would involve the sintering of lunar dust using low-power (1500 watt) microwave energy. The lunar material would be bound by heating to , somewhat below the melting point, in order to fuse the nanoparticle dust into a solid block that is ceramic-like, and would not require the transport of a binder material from Earth as required by the Foster+Partners, Contour Crafting, and D-shape approaches to extraterrestrial building printing. One specific proposed plan for building a lunar base using this technique would be called SinterHab, and would utilize the JPL six-legged ATHLETE robot to autonomously or telerobotically build lunar structures.  Concrete printing  Large-scale, cement-based 3D printing disposes the need for conventional molding by precisely placing, or solidifying, specific volumes of material in sequential layers by a computer controlled positioning process. This 3D printing approach consist of three general stages: data preparation, concrete preparation and component printing. For path and data generation, a variety of methods are implemented for the generation of robotic building paths. A general approach is to slice a 3D shape into flat thin layers with a constant thickness which can be stacked up onto each other. In this method, each layer consists of a contour line and a filling pattern which can be implemented as honeycomb structures or space-filling curves. Another method is the tangential continuity method which produces 3-dimensional building paths with locally varying thicknesses. This method results in creating constant contact surfaces between two layers, therefore, the geometrical gaps between two layers which often limits the 3D printing process will be avoided. The material preparation stage includes mixing and placing the concrete into the container. Once the fresh concrete has been placed into the container, it can be conveyed through the pump–pipe– nozzle system to print out self-compacting concrete filaments, which can build layer-by-layer structural components. In the additive processes, pumpability and the stability of the extrusion is important for the applications of mortars. These properties will all vary depending on the concrete mix design, the delivery system, and the deposition device. General specifications of wet concrete 3D printing are categorized into four main characteristics: * Pumpability: The ease and reliability with which material is moved through the delivery system * Printability: The ease and reliability of depositing material through a deposition device * Buildability: The resistance of a deposited wet material to deformation under load * Open time: The period where the above properties are consistent within acceptable tolerances. To execute the printing process, a control system is required. These systems can be generally split into two categories: gantry systems and robotic arm systems. The gantry system drives a manipulator mounted onto an overhead to locate the print nozzle in XYZ cartesian coordinates while robotic arms offer additional degrees of freedom to the nozzle, allowing more accurate printing workflows such as printing with tangential continuity method. Regardless of the system used for printing (gantry crane or robotic arm), the coordination between the nozzle travel speed and the material flow rate is crucial to the outcome of the printed filament. In some cases, multiple 3D printing robotic arms can be programmed to run simultaneously resulting in decreased construction time. Finally, automated post-processing procedures can also be applied in scenarios which require the removal of support structures or any surface finishing. Construction speed Claims have been made by Behrokh Khoshnevis since 2006 for 3D printing a house in a day, with further claims to notionally complete the building in approximately 20 hours of \\"printer\\" time. By January 2013, working versions of 3D-printing building technology were printing of building material per hour, with a follow-on generation of printers proposed to be capable of per hour, sufficient to complete a building in a week. The Chinese company WinSun has built several houses using large 3D printers using a mixture of quick drying cement and recycled raw materials. Ten demonstration houses were said by Winsun to have been built in 24 hours, each costing US $5000 (structure not including, footings, services, doors/windows and fitout). However, construction 3D printing pioneer Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis claims this was faked and that WinSun stole his intellectual property.  Research and public knowledge  There are several research projects dealing with 3D Construction printing, such as the 3D concrete printing (3DCP) project at the Eindhoven University of Technology, or the various projects at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (Pylos, Mataerial, and Minibuilders). The list of research projects is expanding even more in the last couple of years, thanks to a growing interest in the field. = State-of-the-art research = The majority of the projects have been focused on researching the physical aspects behind the technology, such as the printing technology, material technology, and the various issues related to them. COBOD International (formerly known as 3DPrinthuset, now its sister company) has recently led a research oriented towards exploring the current state of the technology worldwide, by visiting more than 35 different 3D Construction printing related projects. For each project, a research report has been issued, and the gathered data has been used to unify all the various technologies into a first attempt at a common standardized categorization and terminology. The researchers at Purdue University have pioneered a 3D printing process known as Direct-ink-Writing for fabrication of architectured cement- based materials for the first time. They demonstrated using 3D-printing, bio- inspired designs of cement-based materials is feasible and novel performance characteristics such as flaw-tolerance and compliance can be achieved. = First 3D Construction printing conference = Along with the research, 3DPrinthuset (now known as COBOD International) has organized two international conferences on 3D Construction printing (February and November 2017 respectively), aimed at bringing together the strongest names in this emerging industry to discuss the potentials and challenges that lie ahead. The conferences were the first of this kind, and have brought together names such as D-Shape, Contour Crafting, Cybe Construction, Eindhoven's 3DCP research, Winsun, and many more. Along the 3D Construction printing specialists, there has also been a strong presence from the traditional construction industry key players for the first time, with names such as Sika AG, Vinci , Royal BAM Group, NCC, among others. A general idea emerged that the 3D Construction printing field needs a more unified platform where ideas, applications, issues and challenges can be shared and discussed. = Media interest = Although the first steps have been made nearly three decades ago, 3D construction printing has struggled to reach out for years. The first technologies to achieve some media attention were Contour Crafting and D-Shape, with a few sporadic articles in 2008–2012 and a 2012 TV report. D-Shape has also been featured in an independent documentary dedicated to its creator Enrico Dini, called \\"The man who prints houses\\". One important break-through has been seen with the announcement of the first 3D printed building, using a prefabricated 3D printed components made by Winsun, which claimed to be able to print 10 houses in a day with its technology. Although the claims were still to be confirmed, the story has created a wide traction and a growing interest in the field. In a matter of months, many new companies began to emerge. This led to many new endeavors that reached the media, such as, in 2017, the first pedestrian 3d printed bridge and the first cyclist 3d printed bridge, plus an early structural element made with 3d printing in 2016, among many others. Recently, COBOD International, formerly known as 3DPrinthuset (its sister company) has gained wide media attention with their first permanent 3D printed building, the first of its kind in Europe. The project set an important precedent for being the first 3D printed building with a building permit and documentation in place, and a full approval from the city authorities, a crucial milestone for a wider acceptance in the construction field. The story gained extensive coverage, both on national and international media, appearing on TV in Denmark, Russia, Poland, Lithuania, among many others.

The mass is classed as a missa longa due to its length. However, due to its lack of extended writing for the solo parts, it has also been categorised as a missa brevis. The occasion the mass was composed for remains debatable. It may have been composed at the Archbishop Colloredo's request for a special occasion at the Salzburg Cathedral, or at the directive of a different priest - Colloredo's preference for brief settings makes it unlikely that he would have approved of the missa longa.

He played college basketball for the University of Arkansas and Butler University before beginning his professional career in Australia with the Wollongong Hawks. In his rookie season, he was named the NBL's Most Valuable Player. He went on to play in Belgium and Germany before returning to the Hawks in 2016. He can play both point guard and shooting guard, and is known for his three- point shooting ability. During high school, Clarke's sharp shooting and chase for the Oklahoma high-school scoring record attracted large crowds. During his senior year, he led Verdigris High School to the school's first state title. He captured the state scoring record, finishing with more than 3,700 career points. Clarke was highly recruited out of high school, attracting more than 50 college scholarship offers. He selected the Arkansas Razorbacks, joining the team for the 2008–09 season. During a game in 2009, Clarke made 13 three- pointers and scored 51 points, setting SEC and team records respectively. During the 2010–11 season, he led Arkansas in scoring and made the All-SEC second team. Arkansas coach John Pelphrey was fired at the end of the season and Clarke elected to leave the team. After sitting out a year, he joined the Butler Bulldogs for the 2012–13 season. He led the Bulldogs in scoring and was named to the All-Atlantic 10 first team. Early life Clarke was born to Conley and Christine Clarke. He was named after Oklahoma Sooners running back Rotnei Anderson. \\"(Anderson) was fast, and I wanted him to have a fast name,\\" Clarke's father explained. Clarke is one-sixteenth Cherokee and distantly related to actor Will Rogers and athlete Jim Thorpe. From a very young age, Clarke was exposed to sport. By the fourth grade, he and his father were shooting together on an almost daily basis. Clarke's parents, who were both sports coaches, moved frequently as he was growing up. Wherever they went, they made sure Clarke had access to the school's gymnasium. By the time he entered seventh grade, he was attempting 500 shots a night. Before eighth grade, the family moved to Denison, Texas, where Clarke's uncle Kelly had landed a head-basketball coaching job and had brought along Conley as an assistant coach. Within a year, Clarke had worn out the school's shooting machine. High school career=Freshman year= Before high school, Clarke's family returned to Oklahoma when Kelly and Conley Clarke took over coaching at Verdigris High School. Located northeast of Tulsa, Verdigris is a small town consisting of fewer than 4,000 people. Arriving in town a week before classes began, it was doubtful that Clarke would contribute much to a senior-laden team that had made the previous year's state tournament, losing in first round to the eventual champion. He ended up averaging 20 points per game, shooting 47% on three-pointers, while the Verdigris Cardinals finished 24–4. Verdigris recorded its first ever state-playoff win, before losing in the Class 3A semi-finals. Clarke was named to the Tulsa World All-Metro first team. Over the summer, he played for Team Texas where he was asked to play up an age group during a tournament. A 31-point performance against The Family of Detroit brought Clarke to the attention of college recruiters across the country. =Sophomore year= Boosted by several players moving into the area, Verdigris started the 2005–06 season ranked No. 2 in their class. In the first two games of a three-game tournament early in the season, Clarke scored 41 and 44 points. In the championship game, he was held to one three-pointer in the first half, before hitting 9-of-10 in the second half, including a game-tying shot at the buzzer. In overtime, he scored all ten of the Cardinals' points, bringing his game total to 55. Although the Verdigris gym holds 2,700, fans had to show up several hours before games to get a seat. So many people wanted to see Clarke play that highway officials added Verdigris to a highway exit sign on the Will Rogers Turnpike. He ended the year leading the state in scoring at 34.2 points per game. In the area final, Clarke hit the game winner as Verdigris defeated previously unbeaten Adair. In the state tournament, the Cardinals again reached the semi-final game. Clarke was named Metro Player of the Year by Tulsa World, becoming the first sophomore since 1980 to earn the honor, and was the only Oklahoman named to MaxPreps' national honorable mention list. =Junior year= Clarke (#15, center) dribbles the ball against LSU on February 18, 2009 By his junior year, Clarke was a pop-culture hero to many fans and the target of profane insults from opposing crowds. \\"[The insults] just angered me and, in a way, just fueled me and made me want to do better,\\" he recalled. Opponents' defenses grew more physical as they tried to stop Clarke. Verdigris coaches ordered Clarke not to enter the foul lane for fear that he would be clobbered. The team traveled with a nurse who carried bandages, glue, and stitches to treat the frequent blows to the face that Clarke suffered. When he scored a career-high 65 points at Berryhill, Clarke was removed part way through the fourth quarter as his coaches feared for his safety. In a game at Nowata, he received a death threat. When the originators, two local boys, were found, the Clarkes did not press charges but instead asked the perpetrators to apologize at the sheriff's office. In one game, the opposing team had two players simultaneously guard Clarke all game; he still managed to score 31 points. During a playoff game, 2,800 fans showed up to watch Clarke play, 300 more than capacity. He scored 57. In the state playoffs, Verdigris faced Vian, a school with three future Division I football players on their roster. Clarke was subjected to physical defense from a linebacker, had trouble breathing at times due to allergies, and scored 60 points. The performance set a state single-tournament-game record. For the season, Clarke averaged 37.2 points, which increased to 46.2 in the playoffs, and 9.0 rebounds per game. For the third consecutive year, the Cardinals lost in the semi-finals of the state playoffs. Clarke was again named Player of the Year by Tulsa World. During the AAU spring season, he averaged 25 points for Team Texas. =Senior year= During Clarke's senior year, fan fever reached new heights as he battled Pawnee's Keiton Page for the state scoring title. When Verdigris met Pawnee in the Tulsa area Tournament of Champions, so many fans were buying tickets that the start of the game was delayed for 30 minutes. Clarke scored 34, but Pawnee won the game behind 28 points from Page. More than 5,000 fans turned out for the area final against Adair on February 29, 2008, as Clarke closed in on the state scoring record of 3,639 points held by Ty Harman, a record that had stood since 1989. \\"You couldn't get in there sideways,\\" recalled an observer. With 3:14 to go in the fourth quarter, Clarke scored his 3,640th point on a made free throw. Clarke ended the game with 37 points, 3 assists, and 2 steals, as he led Verdigris into the state playoffs with a 70–51 victory. \\"It's a great feeling and it's truly a blessing,\\" Clarke said after the game. \\"I'm glad to have it out of the way so we can focus on our main goal — winning a state championship.\\" While fans rejoiced in the record, others criticized Verdigris for running up the score in some games to get Clarke more points. Coach Kelly Clarke acknowledged the criticism saying, \\"I made a decision that I was going to be the bad guy in this. For three years I took him out [at the end of blowouts]. I didn't want to look back in a couple years and think I held him back from accomplishing this.\\" Clarke launches a shot against LSU February 18, 2009 More than 13,000 people attended the 2008 state finals, filling the aisles of the 10,000 seat arena that hosted the event. The crowd is believed to be the largest ever to witness a high school game in Oklahoma. Clarke scored 25 and led Verdigris to the school's first Class 3A state championship. After the game, he signed autographs for 90 minutes. To recognize the accomplishment, the town of Verdigris renamed a street \\"Rotnei Clarke Road\\" and his school retired his jersey. Since then, the street sign has often been stolen by fans looking for a souvenir. Clarke ended the season averaging 40.9 points, 8.0 rebounds, 6.9 assists, and 3.4 steals per game. He shared Tulsa World Player of the Year honors with Page, who broke the state's single-season scoring record. Clarke ended his high school career with 3,758 points, beating out Page's 3,709 for the most in Oklahoma high school history. Over the course of this career, he averaged 33.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.1 assists, and 3.4 steals per game. He scored more than 40 points 34 times, more than 50 points seven times, and more than 60 twice. He shot 47% on three-pointers, 60% on two-pointers, and 89% on free throws, while leading Verdigris to a 99–15 record. \\"When I think back on [my high school days], it was a crazy deal,\\" says Clarke. \\"It was fun. But at the same time, there was a lot of pressure on every game.\\" According to Verdigris teachers, Clarke was more than a star athlete; he was a role model. He maintained a 4.0 grade point average and was a member of Verdigris' student council and honor society. His work ethic was an inspiration to younger players, and he was happy to help them work on their games. Clarke's active Christian faith inspired classmates to bring Bibles to games and wear T-shirts with Bible verses. \\"He made it OK to give glory to God and not be selfish about things,\\" recalled a teacher. College career=Recruiting= Coming out of high school, Clarke was highly recruited, attracting more than 50 scholarship offers. There was so much interest in Clarke, that he ran up a $400 cell phone bill largely on texts from interested coaches. His bedroom was filled with more than 2,500 recruiting letters. ESPN ranked Clarke as the sixth best point guard, and 52nd best player overall in his recruiting class. Dave Telep, analyst for Scout.com, wrote \\"He is flat out, without a doubt, the best shooter in the 2008 class\\". The service rated Clarke as 4-stars. Clarke turned down offers from Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Memphis, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma State, among others, in order to sign with Arkansas in November 2008. He liked the school's fans, staff, and facilities, and the fact that he would be able to contribute from day one. Clarke's immediate family relocated to Fayetteville, where his maternal grandmother also lived, to support his career. \\"My grandma really [worked] on me\\" to choose Arkansas, he remarked. =Freshman year= During his freshman year, Clarke started all 30 games for Arkansas. He averaged 31.5 minutes and 12.2 points per game. He led the nation in three-point shooting percentage among freshmen at 39.3%, and shot 93.5% on free throws. He hit at least three three-pointers 17 times, and scored in double figures 22 times. =Sophomore year= Prior to his sophomore year, Fox Sports rated Clarke as the top shooter in the country. During a game against Alcorn State, he set a single-game Southeastern conference (SEC) record by hitting 13 three-pointers. His 51 points set a school record. For his accomplishments, Clarke was named SEC Player of the Week on November 16, 2009. He finished the year with 100 made three-pointers, second all-time by an Arkansas player, and averaged 15.1 points per game. He ranked ninth in the country in both three-point shooting percentage (42.7%) and three-pointers made per game (3.2). Clarke was named to the SEC Community Service Team and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) All-District VII team. He led Arkansas in scoring nine times, and scored in double figures 23 times. Additionally, he was named to the athletic department honor roll during fall semester. =Junior year= Clarke prepares to take a free throw against Morgan State on November 25, 2009 As a junior, Clarke was named to the preseason All-SEC second team by Lindy's. Athlon ranked Clarke as the nation's second best shooter, and Sporting News ranked him as the top shooter in the SEC. After scoring an SEC career high 36 points against then 19th ranked Vanderbilt, he was named SEC Player of the Week on January 31, 2011. On February 28, he was again honored as Player of the Week after he led Arkansas to wins over Alabama and 22nd ranked Kentucky. For the season, Clarke led Arkansas with 15.2 points per game and made the All-SEC second team. =Transfer= Arkansas never made the NCAA Tournament during Clarke's tenure and coach John Pelphrey was fired after the 2010–11 season. Upon Pelphrey's firing, Clarke asked to be released from his scholarship. Initially, new head coach Mike Anderson convinced Clarke to stay. After a few months, Clarke again asked for his release. \\"I have spent the last couple of months getting to know Coach Anderson, his staff and his system. And I still feel as though it's best for me to finish my career somewhere else,\\" he explained. Anderson initially refused, but relinquished a short while later. \\"I just knew I was supposed to get out of there,\\" Clarke later recalled. \\"I especially knew it when Coach Pelphrey got fired. I just didn't feel comfortable with it at all. But it was hard because I dedicated so much to that program.\\" Previously, Clarke had asked for a scholarship release after the 2009–10 season. An estimated 40–50 schools expressed interest in Clarke transferring to their team. After carefully weighing his options, Clarke selected Butler, a team that had not recruited him during high school, but had impressed him with back-to-back appearances in the national title game. \\"It just felt like the best fit for me,\\" Clarke remarked. \\"I wasn't interested in things like top-notch facilities anymore,\\" he explained. \\"I was interested in being around good teammates, good people ... And the success Butler had had the previous two years really attracted me.\\" Commenting on Clarke's decision, Eamonn Brennan said he might be a \\"perfect fit\\" for Butler. As a transfer, Clarke had to sit out a year before being eligible to play. He used the redshirt year to work on his game, practicing against Butler's Ronald Nored, who was considered one of the top defenders in the country. \\"I'm not the quickest guy so playing against a defender like that, you find ways to get by, you find different ways to come off a screen,\\" he remarked. NCAA regulations kept Clarke from traveling with the team for road games, so he practiced alone in Hinkle Fieldhouse, refusing to leave until he had made 500 shots on the night. To facilitate his workouts, Clarke persuaded head coach Brad Stevens to give him a key to the building. \\"At night it would just be me and the ball and basket\\", he recalls. \\"That was all that mattered to me. Shooting puts me at ease, it puts me at peace, it takes everything else off my mind.\\" Clarke describes the experience as \\"definitely one of the toughest years,\\" but credits his teammates and his faith for getting him through it. While at Arkansas, Clarke had routinely complained about pain and reduced flexibility in his ankles, but medical tests failed to identify the problem. By the end of seasons, he would be worn down. Butler trainers identified the problem – a bone defect he was born with – but it would require surgery that would confine Clarke to a wheelchair and limit his activity for four months. In the spring of 2012, Clarke elected to undergo the surgery. He had never been without basketball for more than two weeks before, and had trouble dealing with the situation. There were nights he cried himself to sleep. \\"It was the ultimate low for me\\", he later recalled. \\"But this made me realize that if basketball is taken away from me, I know I still have my relationship with Him [God].\\" =Senior year= Clarke (front) and his Arkansas teammates prepare to defend against Morgan State on November 24, 2009 During Clarke's redshirt year, Butler struggled, finishing the year 22–15 and missing the NCAA Tournament. Conley and Chris Clarke took leaves of absence from work to live in Indianapolis during the subsequent 2012–13 season. Clarke was selected to the Atlantic 10 Preseason All-Conference second team, but Butler started the season unranked. During the opening round game of the Maui Invitational, Clarke hit a running three-pointer at the buzzer to lead Butler to a 72–71 victory over Marquette. Video of the shot went viral. \\"You grow up as a kid — I know I did — watching that tournament, wanting to be in that situation in that atmosphere\\", Clarke remarked. \\"To hit a shot like that and be able to celebrate with my teammates was one of the coolest things ever.\\" For his efforts, Clarke was named to the All-Tournament team and selected as the Atlantic 10 Player of the Week. On December 15, 2012, Butler faced off against number one ranked Indiana. With Indiana up four points in overtime, Clarke hit a three-pointer that launched an 8–2 Butler run to finish the game. After the game, Clarke remarked that the possibility of big upsets \\"was one of the reasons I came [to Butler]\\". The win was Butler's first ever over a number-one ranked them and launched them into the top 25. By early January, the team was ranked 13th in the AP Poll. On January 12, 2013, during a game against Dayton, Clarke stole the ball from Matt Derenbecker and was going up for a fast-break layup when he was fouled hard from behind by Derenbecker. Clarke lost his balance and crashed headfirst into the basket support. He collapsed to the floor where he remained for several minutes. From his neck down, he was numb; his arms moved, but he had no control over the movement. Coach Stevens called it the scariest thing he had ever witnessed on the basketball court. As medical trainers examined Clarke, he told them \\"I'm not coming out [of the game]\\". Despite his declaration, he knew the situation was serious, but he tried to stay positive: \\"I tried to think as many good things as I could, that I was going to be OK and that everything was going to be fine.\\" After a long delay, Clarke was taken from the floor on a stretcher and transported to an area hospital. By the time he arrived, the numbness was subsiding. X-rays revealed that he had suffered a severely strained neck, but no long-term damage. \\"He is really lucky,\\" remarked Stevens. \\"There was a distinct possibility he wouldn't walk again.\\" Two hours later, Clarke walked out of the hospital in a soft neck brace, and with a new perspective. \\"I feel very blessed that day that I was able to walk out of that hospital,\\" he said. \\"It hit like I've never been hit before. There are more important things than a game of basketball.\\" Clarke missed Butler's next three games and was not allowed to engage in strenuous activity such as basketball practice. \\"That was the worst thing for me,\\" he remarked. \\"I'm not a patient guy,\\" he explained. \\"[I had] to learn to be patient ... and listen to whatever the doctors [told] me\\". The day he received his medical release, Clarke was back in Hinkle shooting. \\"It [was] the first time [I'd] seen him truly happy in two weeks,\\" remarked Clarke's father. Clarke returned to action on January 26 in a game against Temple after missing three games. He scored 24 points and dished out a career-high nine assists. Clarke (far right) and his Arkansas teammates on defense against LSU on February 10, 2010 Clarke finished the regular season with a 16.7 point per game average, fourth in the Atlantic 10. He was first in the conference in made three-pointers per game (3.5) and free throw percentage (89.6%). Clarke led Butler to a 24–7 record and third-place finish in the Atlantic 10. His accomplishments landed Clarke on the Atlantic 10 All- Conference first team. He was selected to the National Association of Basketball Coaches All-District 4 team and was the only non-Big Ten player selected for the USBWA All-District V team. During the Atlantic 10 Tournament, Clarke scored 21 and 14 points in wins over Dayton and La Salle, and 16 points in a loss to St. Louis. He collected eight assists and hit ten three-pointers over the three game stretch. Clarke's efforts landed him on the All-Tournament first team. Butler entered the NCAA Tournament as the sixth seed. For Clarke, it was the first time his team was selected to a postseason tournament. Commenting on the experience, he said \\"I was extremely nervous [watching the selection show.] I don't know why. It's my first time to go through this and I was sweating and my knees were shaking a little bit.\\" In Butler's round of 64 NCAA tournament game versus Bucknell, Clarke struggled with nerves. \\"I wouldn't want to admit that, but it kind of showed, I think,\\" he remarked. Through the first thirty minutes of the game, he had only six points and no made three-pointers. However, over the final ten minutes he scored 11, including two important threes, helping Butler to a 68–56 victory. Two days later, Butler faced off with Marquette. Clarke came out hot, scoring 18 before half time. However, he injured his shoulder near the end of the half and was less effective in the second half, scoring just six points. He missed a potential game winning three in the final seconds, but made five on the game. \\"My shoulder is sore, but that didn't have any effect on the [last] shot,\\" he remarked. It was later revealed that he injured ligaments near his clavicle, an injury that requires six-weeks of recovery time. Clarke ended the season with 115 made three-pointers, second most ever by a Butler player, and fifth most ever by an Atlantic 10 player. For the season, he was first in the Atlantic 10 and sixth in the NCAA in made threes per game with 3.48. His 88.6% free-throw accuracy ranked second in the Atlantic 10, and ninth on the Butler all-time list. Clarke made at least one three in all 33 games he played for Butler, and his last 46 college games overall. He finished his career with 389 made three-pointers, tied for 15th in NCAA history. \\"When I made my decision to leave Arkansas, I knew that I wanted to be somewhere that I'd have the opportunity to play in the NCAA Tournament ... It's amazing how God works\\", commented Clarke on his Butler experience. \\"I'm blessed and thankful to be able to share two years with these guys, this coaching staff, and been a part of the Butler community. It's been pretty special.\\" Clarke was selected to participate in the postseason all-star game for college seniors, but withdrew due to the shoulder injury he suffered against Marquette. While still recovering from the shoulder injury, he participated in the Portsmouth (Va.) Invitational camp and tournament for NBA prospects in mid-April. He averaged 10.3 points and 4.3 assists over three games. Professional career=2013 NBA draft= Ahead of the 2013 NBA draft, Clarke trained at St. Vincent Sports Performance and hired Doug Neustadt to be his agent. Clarke had workouts with the Indiana Pacers and Washington Wizards, but was not expected to be drafted due to his height. ESPN's Chad Ford ranked Clarke as the year's 98th best prospect. Ultimately, he was not drafted. Clarke said he would rather play professionally in Europe than in the NBA Development League, believing that is his most likely route to the NBA. \\"I do believe I have the confidence and I have the ability to play in [the NBA],\\" he said. \\"I'm not going to go out and say I'm going to be a starter ... But I do believe I have the ability to come in and do things that a lot of people think I can't.\\" =Wollongong Hawks= The Wollongong Hawks of Australia's National Basketball League contacted Clarke's agent and were told that Clarke intended to play in Europe and was out of their price range. Clarke later had a change of heart, and on August 1, 2013, he signed with the Hawks for the 2013–14 NBL season. He made his debut for the Hawks in the team's season opener on October 10, recording 20 points and six rebounds in a 92–73 loss to the New Zealand Breakers. The Hawks struggled with consistency in 2013–14, but behind Clarke, they managed to stay in playoff contention. Clarke earned Player of the Month honors twice during the season, for December and February, and battled for MVP supremacy with Melbourne Tigers guard Chris Goulding and Perth Wildcats forward James Ennis. Clarke helped the Hawks finish the regular season with a 13–15 record, good for fourth spot on the ladder out of eight teams. In their semi-final match-up with the Perth Wildcats, Clarke struggled with his shot, going 10-of-32 over the two games they played. In the best-of-three series, the Hawks were swept 2–0 by the eventual champion Wildcats. At the season's end, he was named the recipient of the NBL Most Valuable Player Award ahead of Goulding and Ennis. He finished third in total points scored (633), fourth in scoring average (21.1 points per game), equal first for three-pointers (95) and third for free throw percentage (81%). He appeared in all 30 games for the Hawks and also averaged 2.0 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. =Okapi Aalstar= On June 19, 2014, Clarke signed with Belgian club Okapi Aalstar for the 2014–15 season. In 32 games for the club, he averaged 17.5 points, 2.4 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. He also played in six EuroChallenge games, averaging 15.5 points, 1.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.0 steals per game. =Telekom Baskets Bonn= On July 10, 2015, Clarke signed with German club Telekom Baskets Bonn for the 2015–16 season. In 33 games for the club, he averaged 11.5 points, 1.8 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game. He also played in 10 EuroCup games, averaging 11.1 points, 1.6 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. =Illawarra Hawks and Italy= On July 12, 2016, Clarke signed a two-year deal with the Illawarra Hawks, returning to the club for a second stint. October 7, 2016, he scored a team-high 23 points in the Hawks' 122–88 season- opening win over the Adelaide 36ers. On December 5, 2016, he scored a season- high 29 points off the bench in a 99–93 loss to the Sydney Kings. On February 11, 2017, in the Hawks' regular season finale, Clarke had 24 points, six assists, five rebounds off the bench in helping the team secure a playoff spot with a 106–79 win over the Brisbane Bullets. Two days later, he was named the recipient of the NBL Best Sixth Man Award. After helping the Hawks defeat the first-seeded Adelaide 36ers in the semi-finals, Clarke and the Hawks moved on to the best-of-five NBL Grand Final series, where they were defeated 3–0 by the Perth Wildcats. He appeared in all 34 games for the Hawks in 2016–17, averaging 17.4 points, 2.7 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.0 steals per game. On March 9, 2017, Clarke signed with Victoria Libertas Pesaro of the Lega Basket Serie A for the rest of the 2016–17 season. In eight games for Pesaro, he averaged 19.5 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.0 steals per game. In his second season with the Illawarra Hawks, Clarke averaged 18.1 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 25 games. On November 5, 2017, he scored a season- high 29 points in a 93–83 win over the Sydney Kings. The Hawks missed the finals in 2017–18 with a 12–16 record. On February 20, 2018, Clarke re-signed with Victoria Libertas Pesaro for the rest of the 2017–18 season. He joined Pallacanestro Trapani of the Italian second division on July 16, 2018. On August 1, 2019, he has signed with Pallacanestro Mantovana of the Italian Serie A2 Basket. Skill set and accolades Clarke shoots over a Morgan State defender on November 25, 2009 Clarke began high school as a shooting guard, but worked to expand his game. \\"I [worked] very hard on being able to get my shot off the dribble, hard on driving the basket and on all facet of my game,\\" he said. \\"I was determined not to be known as just a spot-up shooter.\\" During the summer AAU season after his sophomore year, he switched to playing the point. During his three years at Arkansas, Clarke switched back to being a shooting guard. During his redshirt year at Butler, he ran the point for the scout team. He handled the task well and became Butler's primary ball-handler for the 2012–13 season, but also played off the ball at times. On Clarke's transition to point guard and role on the team, Butler assistant coach Michael Lewis remarked, \\"He's a much better overall basketball player than he was at Arkansas. At the same time, we ... don't want to limit Rotnei Clarke's shot.\\" Clarke was named \\"Metro Boys Player of the Year\\" three times by Tulsa World. Prior to college, he was invited to the NBA Players Association Camp, as well as basketball camps run by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. During the 2009–10 season, both Fox Sports and ESPN's Andy Katz rated Clarke as the best shooter in college basketball. During the 2010–11 season, Clarke was ranked the nation's second best shooter by Athlon. Prior to the 2012–13 season, USA Today's Big Lead Sports ranked Clarke as the 35th best player in college basketball. That same season, Jay Bilas described Clarke as the nation's top three-point shooter. He was selected as a finalist for the 2013 Naismith College Player of the Year. On Clarke, Stevens commented: \\"It's arguable who is the best standstill three-point shooter, but I don't know that there's anybody I've ever seen in the last three years who can make so many tough threes with just a sliver of daylight.\\" Clarke's catch-to-shot-release time has been clocked at 0.6 seconds. Clarke is often referred to as a \\"gym rat\\" because of his work ethic. During high school, a typical workout would involve 500 made three-pointers, 200 made free throws, numerous mid-range jumpshots, weight-lifting, sprinting and ball-handling drills. Sessions could last four hours or more. \\"You learn to shoot when you're fatigued,\\" says Clarke. \\"If you want something bad enough, you will work as hard as you can to get there.\\" Stevens credits Clarke's work ethic for motivating the rest of the team. \\"Our team gets in the gym twice as much because of Rotnei's presence,\\" Stevens declared. \\"He is the ultimate gym rat.\\" Personal life Clarke's Christian faith plays a central role in his life. \\"I give all my glory to God. He put me on this Earth to play basketball.\\" he explains. In 2012, when basketball was taken away from him due to surgery, Clarke began to doubt his faith. \\"There was a time I definitely doubted God,\\" he recalls. \\"I left my family. I left my friends. I left diehard fans who just wanted to see me succeed ... It was the ultimate low for me.\\" After some soul searching, he concluded his doubts were a \\"mistake\\". He explains: Clarke has been described as the Tim Tebow of basketball due to his evangelic outreach. During high school, teachers and classmates noticed the way Clarke lived his life and were attracted to his faith. He regularly spoke with teammates and opposing players about his faith. He left letters on visiting players' lockers explaining what Jesus meant to him. At Arkansas, Clarke often spoke about his faith at churches and basketball events around Fayetteville. During his senior year at Butler, he organized an on-campus event \\"Rotnei Clarke's Testimony\\" where he talked about his faith. Clarke is naturally an introvert and does not necessarily like being recognized off the basketball court. He has a close relationship with his sister Cassie, with whom he exchanges Bible verses via text message before games. \\"Cassie and I are best friends,\\" Clarke remarks. He is good friends with former Butler player Ronald Nored. Clarke describes himself as \\"an outdoorsy kind of guy.\\" When he is not playing basketball, he enjoys hunting and fishing. He listens to Christian rap regularly and cites Lecrae as a non- athlete that he looks up to. Clarke lists J. J. Redick as his favorite basketball player of all-time. He hopes to become a coach after his playing days are over. He said \\"I don't think I'll ever get away from the game of basketball.\\" In June 2014, Clarke married Patricia Elliott, and the couple have one daughter, Kyah.

A Barga Mongol,Sanders 1996, p. 49 Damdinsüren was born on March 13, 1871, in Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia. At the age of seven he began to learn Manchu and Mongolian writing. In 1908 he officially inherited his father's rank Zhang. While visiting the imperial court in Beijing he met with Prince Mijiddorjiin Khanddorj with whom he first broached the idea of overthrowing the Manchu domination of Outer Mongolia. In 1911 he and other Mongolian nobility and high ranking Buddhist lamas participated in a secret congress in Ikh Khüree convened by Mongolia's religious leader, the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, to formulate a declaration of independence from Manchu Chinese rule. Once the declaration was issued, Damdinsüren helped mobilize thousands of soldiers, seized the northern Inner Mongolian city of Hailar and offered his allegiance to the Bogd Khan.

She was number 900 on President George H. W. Bush's Thousand Points of Light foundation list in 1993. Life and career=Education= Born SuEllen Weissman on September 18, 1932 in St. Louis, Missouri, she graduated from University City High School in University City, MO in 1950. She studied at Washington University in St. Louis, MO, where she was a member of Sigma Delta Tau.St. Louis Post Dispatch, March 2, 1952. She earned a B.A. from Park University, in Parkville, MO in 1975 and an M.A. equivalency from the American Dance Therapy Association in 1996. Fried was a member of the Dance Ensemble of the St. Louis Municipal Opera from 1949 through 1951.

In 1970 was appointed to President Richard Nixon's Task Force on the Mentally Handicapped. She was a consultant to the National Institute of Mental Health as well as the Center for Advanced Study and Continuing Education in Mental Health. Fried's work with Dr. Karl Menninger led her to found STOP Violence in 1982, an organization that developed a program called Reaching Out From Within. This monthly program trained volunteers to teach prison inmates to change their violent language, actions and thoughts. As of 2004, it ran ten programs in seven Kansas Correctional facilities. The program has been effective, recording much lower recidivism rates among program participants than non-participating inmates. From a Huffington Post profile of Fried and Reaching Out From Within: :Over 40 percent of American prisoners released in 2004 returned to a state penitentiary within three years of being released, according to a 2011 Pew study. Among inmates who attend between 20 and 40 ROFW meetings, the recidivism rate drops to 23 percent, according to Fried, and it further decreases to just 8 percent among inmates who attend a minimum of 60 meetings. : =Abuse prevention work= Fried draws upon her dance therapy experience in her abuse prevention program, helping teach body awareness and how to adjust to others. Fried's seven \\"prevention principles\\" were defined in her book Bullies and Victims, and given the acronym SCRAPES: * Self-esteem and skill enrichment * Conflict resolution and mediation skills * Respect for differences * Anger management and assertiveness training * Problem solving skills * Empathy training * Sexuality awareness training. Her books are intended for parents of children who have been bullied as well as those whose children may be bullies. She and her co-authors attempt to offer practical suggestions for minimizing peer abuse, to teach about the harm caused by gossip and name-calling and to prevent an escalation to violence.

Many of his inventions were geared towards the improvement of disabled people's lives, and he won many awards recognizing these efforts. Life Of Armenian descent, Emik Avakian was born in Tabriz, Persia in 1924. Avakian was born with a severe case of cerebral palsy, but this did not affect his cognitive abilities. In order to seek medical assistance for Emik, the Avakian family traveled from Persia, to Russia, to Germany, and finally settling in New York City. By the age of thirteen, Emik was already fixing many electrical engineering problems around the household. Although he suffered considerably, Avakian graduated magna cum laude from Eureka College with a degree in physics and mathematics. He later earned his master's degree at Columbia University. Throughout his years as a student, Avakian had trouble communicating with typists who would write down notes for him. He resided in Massachusetts with his wife Anne until his death. Inventions In order to overcome many of the difficulties he experienced in life, Avakian created a series of inventions. One of his more notable inventions was a typewriter that would produce letters from breath rather than typing. The typewriter would operate according to breath measurement and sound that would be blown into four microphones. Although the mechanism was slow, it was still more cost effective to use the device than to hire an assisting type writer. Another significant invention was the \\"information retrieval and storage apparatus,\\" which was a machine that could display library and archive information more quickly than other methods. Awards *In 1961, President of the United States John F. Kennedy honored Avakian for his outstanding contributions to handicap employment. *Eminent Engineer Award (1979) *Armenian Bicentennial Committee's \\"Excellence in the Field of Science Award\\" (1976) *Shah of Iran Crown Medal (1963) *Honorary Doctorate Award of Eureka College (1996) In addition to his awards, Avakian was featured in renowned and local publications, including Life magazine and Mechanix Illustrated in 1952, 1953, and 1962.

(2009). Cognitive Rigor: Blending the strengths of Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge to enhance classroom-level processes. [Technical Report]. Retrieved from ERIC database. (ED517804). http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED517804.pdf. The concept \\"is marked and measured by the depth and extent students are challenged and engaged to demonstrate and communicate their knowledge and thinking\\" and also \\"marks and measures the depth and complexity of student learning experiences.\\" Cognitive Rigor is the superposition of Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge levels and is used to categorize the level of abstraction of questions and activities in education. The Cognitive Rigor Matrix assists applying Cognitive Rigor in the classroom. These models are intended for use in curriculum development and lesson planning so that students acquire the rigorous skills and knowledge needed for post-secondary education. The idea of interlacing Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge to create a new tool for measuring curricular quality was completed in 2005 by Karin Hess of the National Center for Assessment, producing a 4 X 6 matrix (the Cognitive Rigor Matrix or Hess Matrix) for categorizing the Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge levels for each activity or question appearing in curricular materials. The Cognitive Rigor Matrix aligns the six Bloom’s Taxonomy levels along the columns of the matrix and the four Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge levels along the rows. Working independently, John Walkup and Ben Jones of The Standards Company LLC developed an identical matrix in 2007 and used it to measure the cognitive rigor of completed student work collected from two large-scale studies of the enacted curriculum in Oklahoma and Nevada.The Standards Company LLC. (2008a). “Study of the alignment of student assignments to the academic standards in the state of Nevada pursuant to Senate Bill 184, Chap. 420, Statutes of Nevada 2007.” Retrieved April 13, 2009, from Legislative Counsel Bureau, Nevada State Legislature, technical report, http://www.leg.state.nv.us/lcb/fiscal/Final_ReportCurriculum_Study.pdf The Standards Company LLC. (2008b). “Analysis of the enacted curriculum for the Oklahoma State Department of Education for the collection period February – March, 2008.” Oklahoma State Department of Education, unpublished technical report. In 2009, Hess, et al. published a paper defining Cognitive Rigor, describing how the model overcomes limitations of using Bloom's Taxonomy, and describing the model's use. The paper shows how Bloom's Taxonomy identifies processes (categorizes cognitive skills), and Webb's Depth of Knowledge shows quantification and application (focuses on depth of understanding and scope of content). The combined models further the application of Bloom's Taxonomy to testing and assessment applications. The Cognitive Rigor Matrix included in the article is often made available as a separate document, with example activities included in each cell of the matrix.Hess' Cognitive Rigor Matrix and Curricular Examples: Applying Webb’s Depth-of-Knowledge Levels to Bloom’s Cognitive Process Dimensions – English Language Arts. http://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/M1-Slide_22_DOK_Hess_Cognitive_Rigor.pdfHess' Cognitive Rigor Matrix and Curricular Examples: Applying Webb’s Depth-of- Knowledge Levels to Bloom’s Cognitive Process Dimensions – Mathematics and Science. http://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/M2-Activity_2_Handout.pdf The Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium adopted the concept of Cognitive Rigor and the Hess Matrix in 2012 to measure the rigor of test items for the Next Generation of Assessments.Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

He was a part of the Progressive Artists' Group in Bombay and was a founder of the Artists’ Centre in Mumbai. Opinions about Ara’s works remain divided with his critics accusing them of lacking perfection and not referenced from life.In 2017, curator Qaroon Thapar 22 works of Ara in an exhibition inMumbai called 'Privately Ara'.  Early life  Ara was born in Bolarum, Secunderabad in April 1914, the son of a chauffeur. His mother died when he was three and his father remarried. He ran away from home to Mumbai when he was seven. The city remained his home until his death in 1985. In Mumbai he earned a living by cleaning cars and later found employment with an English family as a houseboy. While employed he nevertheless found time to engage with his passion for painting and it soon caught the attention of first Rudy von Leyden, an art critic from the Times of India, and then Walter Langhammer, the Editor of the Illustrated Weekly of India. Langhammer was so impressed by Ara’s skill that had him enrolled at the J.J. School of Art. Ara participated in the Salt Satyagraha during the Civil Disobedience Movement and was jailed for five months. He later found employment with a Japanese firm as a car cleaner. Later, on India's independence he created a large canvas depicting an Independence Day procession of a multitude of Indian people in exuberant celebrations.  Career as an artist  Ara hosted his first solo show at the Chetana Restaurant in Bombay in 1942 which was a runaway success. He joined the Progressive Artists' Group which included M F Hussain, H A Gade, S H Raza, F N Souza and Sadanand Bakre in 1948. The group set up the Artists' Centre at Kala Ghoda, opposite the Prince of Wales Museum. He held several shows with the group but with Souza, Raza, Gade and Bakre leaving India, the group became undone. From 1948 to 1955, Ara held several solo and group shows in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Baroda and Calcutta and later had solo exhibitions across Eastern Europe, Japan, Germany and Russia. In 1963 he exhibited his 'Black Nude' series in Mumbai and was part of the inaugural show at the Pundole Art Gallery. The Kumar Gallery, New Delhi acquired his works between 1955 and 1960.  Artistic style  Ara began his career doing landscapes and paintings on socio-historical themes but he is best known for his still life and nude paintings. Ara was the first contemporary Indian painter to focus on the female nude as a subject while staying within the limits of naturalism. Several of his works deal with still life and human figure studies. While he initially used watercolours and gouaches, where his use of the impasto effect often made them resemble oil paintings, he later moved on to the use of oil paints. Here his successful execution of thin pigmentation recalled his initial work with water colors as seen in the painting 'Woman with Flowers'.Ara work reflected a deep influence of French modern artists, specially Paul Cezanne.  Awards  Ara won the Governor's Award for painting in 1944 and a Gold Medal from the Bombay Art Society for his canvas 'Two Jugs' in 1952. He also won the Windsor and Newton cash price, Bombay.  Criticism  Some of his critics have accused his paintings of being poorly executed and not referenced from life. The wrongly depicted female genitalia in some of his nudes have also drawn criticism with some viewers claiming that his paintings of groups of vases have greater voluptuousness than his nude forms.  Family and later life  Ara remained a lifelong bachelor and asexual as a person according to his adopted daughter Ruxana Pathan. Later in his career, Ara exhibited less and began to spend greater time at the Artists’ Centre, where he often helped struggling artists from his personal funds. He lived in penury in the last decades of his life, far removed from the success he had enjoyed in the 1950s and 60s. Unlike Souza, Raza and Husain, his paintings have failed to emulate their renown or prices. Ara was part of the managing committee of the Bombay Art Society and later became a Fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi. He died in Mumbai in 1985.

As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology histoire raisonnée, and the usage of \\"natural history\\" by David Hume in his work The Natural History of Religion. It was related to \\"philosophical history\\", a broader-based kind of historical theorising, but concentrated on the early history of man in a type of rational reconstruction that had little contact with evidence. Such conjectural history was the antithesis of the narrative history being written at the time by Edward Gibbon and William Robertson. Stewart defended it as more universal in its application to humankind, even at the cost of detailed documentation.Nisbet and Costa, p. 629. It was not concerned with the political narrative and public life, but saw itself as an investigative \\"moral science\\". General philosophical history was somewhat closer to narrative history than conjectural history could be, with its reliance in part on tenuous arguments on the nature of feudalism and early ethnographical reports from European travellers. For Stewart the Dissertation on the Origin of Languages by Adam Smith was an important example. To justify the procedures of conjectural history, there needed to be an assumption of the uniformity of human nature, or as Stewart put it, the \\"capacities of the human mind\\". Conjectural history has been identified as \\"the core of a theory\\" of progress within Scottish philosophical history of the period. Pocock writes that Scottish conjectural history was \\"of considerable importance to Gibbon and the creation of philosophical historiography\\".Pocock, p. 305. By the 1780s there were European historians of culture who worked in a different way, preferring an inductive method to the pure deductions of conjectural history. In the later development of anthropology and archaeology, opposition to the whole \\"conjectural history\\" tradition led to the development of culture history. Early Modern context There was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in Early Modern Europe, particularly on civil society in its components, civility and \\"society\\". =Models and the \\"savage\\"= Hodgen comments, in a chapter From Hierarchy to History, on the widespread use of \\"conjectural series\\" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The great chain of being was a static idea. \\"Stage series\\" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time > ... it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs > of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical > assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these > conjectural series.Hodgen, p. 467. =Early Modern natural history= While the Natural History of Pliny the Elder was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, \\"natural history\\" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the Baconian natural history, i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to natural philosophy, which was theoretical. =Histoire raisonnée= The histoire raisonnée was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of humanist historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With Géraud de Cordemoy there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to Fortune.Leffler, pp. 223–9. =Stadial history= Contemporary terminology is stadial history, or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory). Stadial theory as an innovation is attributed to the jurist Samuel Pufendorf. Grotius had already used conjectural history to discuss Aquinas on private property. Some basic conjectural history on human civilization was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected the concept of the state of nature, and with Count Buffon debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its anthropocentrism and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature. It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of Native Americans) as valid.Hopfl, pp. 24–5. Conjectural histories of language and writing Adam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748, advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of Gabriel Girard. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style. This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase \\"conjectural history\\". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature Lucretius; it is now considered Smith was influenced by Montesquieu on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on political economy. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's history of astronomy; and the term can be seen as a misnomer. Monboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of manners. William Warburton had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his Divine Legation of Moses, a work supporting biblical authority, around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens. Where writing moved from pictograms to alphabets, he saw language use as having moved analogously from gestures to forms and figures of speech. The four stages theory The term \\"conjectural history\\" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time. There was an orthodox four stages theory of society, the stages being: # hunting; # pasturage; # agriculture; and # commerce. This ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or unilineal evolution. Some economic determinism applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern. The invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, Turgot and Vico. In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by David Dalrymple and Lord Kames; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on jurisprudence. In France it was published at much the same time, also, by Claude Pierre Goujet, Claude Adrien Helvétius, and François Quesnay. Smith's \\"natural progress of opulence\\" is a closely related theory. Representative works Besides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included Adam Ferguson, David Hume, Lord Kames, John Millar, and Lord Monboddo, writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s. Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory. Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial. He included primates and feral children as material. Robertson in his History of America moves between narrative and conjectural history.Hopfl, p. 21. =Adam Ferguson, An Essay on the History of Civil Society (1767)= Ferguson in this work attempted a rigorous identification of the hunter stage with the so-called barbarian or savage, and was very alive to the whole scheme as full of tensions within human possibility.Pocock, pp. 330–5. He argued against the foundation story in the style of classical history, proposing instead that unintended consequences could have more to do with the \\"establishment\\" of a society than a self-conscious law-giver.Hopfl, p. 30. =John Millar, Observations concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society (1771)= Millar argued in terms of a \\"system of manners\\" associated with each of the four stages. He also discussed the advance of freedom, and denounced slavery. As property became more complex, it followed that government did so also. Poovey states that this work makes apparent the relationship of conjectural history with the experimental moral philosophy of Thomas Reid and George Turnbull. =Lord Kames, Sketches of the History of Man (1774)= Kames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of Montesquieu, as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation. The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of natural law. In writing to Basel in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from Isaak Iselin, Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit (1764), which is also a conjectural history. The Sketches was a collection of essays on social, cultural and political topics. In it the author collected some ethnographic and miscellaneous information, assembling in particular a long chapter intended as a \\"history of women\\". There was a second edition (Edinburgh, 1778) and a third (Dublin, 1779). Kames was an early polygenist, or was an environmental monogenist only with scepticism about the adequacy of the theory. In any case he argued that his approach could be reconciled with the scriptural ethnography, via the story of the Tower of Babel. While he stated that he had collected materials for a history for 30 years, Kames's work as written up was unsystematic, even rambling. His scheme of conjectural history includes the idea that the providential order allows the historian to write in the absence of a full factual basis. A German translation by Anton Ernst Klausing appeared as Versuche über die Geschichte des Menschen from 1774. Later developments=The tradition comes to an end= Mainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as John Adams, William Alexander and John Logan failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's History of Women (1779) being criticised as shallow. Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his Account of Adam Smith for the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and John Burrow has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism. Where stadial theory appeared in later authors, the original thrust was distorted. Hopfl has said that the heirs were James Mill, John Stuart Mill, and Auguste Comte.Hopfl, p. 32. Hawthorne writes instead of the historical/sociological insights of the Scots being lost in the British context, despite the \\"tension between a 'natural' account of civil society and a developing sense of the factual importance and moral difficulties of individualism\\" having become apparent, to utilitarianism and vaguer evolutionism. =Religious opposition= The Encyclopædia Britannica, in its second edition but particularly in its third edition (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition James Tytler opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of George Gleig, featured \\"Savage\\" as a new topic, and expanded articles \\"Society\\" and \\"Moral philosophy\\". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by David Doig who had answered Kames with Two Letters on the Savage State from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. Robert Heron contributed to the article \\"Society\\", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing Lucretius and Democritus, and godless materialist spontaneous generation of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history. The articles on \\"Beauty\\" and \\"Love\\" were also changed to remove the influence of Kames, as part of the consistent assertion of scriptural monogenism. =Relationship to antiquarianism= Conjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British antiquarian circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by Richard Gough and James Douglas, was favoured in the second half of the century.Sweet, pp. 20–3. On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and civic humanism. The urban history of John Trussel was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the feudal system was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest. The stadial history was embraced by Thomas Pownall. =Conjectural history of peoples= Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing \\"hunting\\" into \\"gathering\\" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development. Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current \\"peoples\\" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in Lewis Henry Morgan. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and structural functionalism led to a rejection of the whole paradigm. =\\"Scottish orientalism\\"=References H. M.

The film got a clearance in the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal in the first week of March 2013. Finally the film is set to be released on 2 August 2013.  Plot  In the Bengali language, the name of the film literally translates to \\"War cry of the Beggars\\". The film shows two imaginary groups of contemporary Bengal- Fyataru: Flying human beings; Choktor: Black Magic sect Bhodi. The head of the Choktors, initiates a total war against the ruling political party of West Bengal, India. Fyatarus join hands with Choktors. Advised by Calcutta's progenitors Dandabayash (ageless primordial talking crow) and an Indo-colonial half-breed Begum Johnson(1732-1818) erupt a historic insurrection. They jointly launch guerrilla attacks against the Government. Skulls dance in crematoria and flying-discs flutter in the skies and cry anarchy, resident ghosts gossip and prattle, and the police is in total confusion. Government is forced to surrender and offer a peace proposal to the joint force.

The letter of denial cited excessive use of abusive language, sexuality, frivolous approach in portraying of social movements and negative portrayal of the character Joseph Stalin. Mukhopadhyay, the director of the film, was angry that the film was blocked by the censor board and he said in an interview: \\"It is frightening because it is interference of an artist's work and it is happening again and again in West Bengal. It is not the first time. There was Ambikesh Mahapatra cartoon case, there was the segregation of newspapers and TV channels as friendly and not friendly, there was the student who was called a Maoist because she asked a question. All these small events are symptomatic of a mindset of what I will say are fascist tendencies.\\" In March 2013, the film was cleared by the tribunal and most objections raised by the Censor Board was rejected by the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal headed by chairman Lalit Bhasin. But, they did not allow to portray the full oath of Mamata Banerjee as West Bengal's Chief Minister, since they felt it was not a biopic on Banerjee and the filmmakers were asked to cut the 76 words' oath by fifty per cent. A particular scene of the movie involving swapna sio was in controversy due to nudity and graphic depiction of Sex.

Until the 20th century the cuisine of Hamburg was predominantly characterized by the extensive choice of different kinds of fish from the river Elbe and the nearby Baltic Sea. The region of Vierlande supplied Hamburg with fresh vegetables. Fruit came from the area Altes Land and until industrialization the neighbourhood of Wilhelmsburg was considered the ‘milk isle’ of Hamburg. International trade in the Port of Hamburg made spices and exotic nutrition items from India and South America available since the 16th century which were soon incorporated into civic kitchens. On this basis the cuisine of Hamburg developed which regrettably lost some of its characteristics nowadays due to the supraregional harmonization of the North German cuisine. But due to its high economic importance Hamburg does feature many internationally recognized gourmet restaurants from which 11 were repeatedly awarded with a Michelin star in 2010.Hamburg wieder die Hochburg der Sterneköche ; retrieved, 12 February 2010) Historical aspects The fish market of Hamburg in 1973 (courtesy of the Bundesarchiv, B 145, Bild-F041596-0009) For much of its history Hamburg has been a major trading hub, resulting in both the development of a wealthy mercantile class, and a wide availability of goods from around the world. In the homes of wealthy residents, the kitchens were located in the back of the house, and divided into two parts. One part was the ‘splendor kitchen’, in which the tin and copper tableware was exhibited, and the other part was the real ‘work kitchen’, with a brick-built stove made of clay. The crockery and cutlery were kept in a cupboard called the ‘Schapp’ in the hallway, jars and bowls in the ‘Richtbank’, which was a table or low cupboard on which dishes and meals were prepared and arranged for serving. Since the 18th century there were also kitchens that were built into the cellars in the homes of tradesmen.Ernst Finder: Hamburgisches Bürgertum in der Vergangenheit. Hamburg 1930, Seite 253 However many of the traditional dishes have their origins in the lower-class households of Hamburg's population. There were no separated kitchens in the domiciles and booths of the impecunious and poor and, as firewood was quite expensive, ovens were seldom used for cooking. This means that warm dishes were rare and if there was any cooking the dish was most commonly prepared as a stew.Rita Bake, Birgit Kiupel: Sach- und Gefühlslexikon in alphabetischer Reihenfolge von Abschied bis Zuckerbäcker. Hamburg 1987, Seite 75 A famous legend of the ‚Lachsessen‘ (lit.: salmon meal) hints to the nutritional differences between social classes.Otto Benecke: Vom Lachs-Essen auf Wikisource According to it, Hamburg had such an abundant amount of salmon so even the poor did not want to eat it anymore. The council of Hamburg then enacted an edict saying that masters were not allowed to give salmon to their maidservants and minions more frequently than twice a week. Though this is only a legend it is indeed true that salmon were widely available since the 19th century. Regional cuisine=Fish dishes= Fried plaice with bacon, Finkenwerder style Due to its location on the Elbe river and its proximity to the sea the regional cuisine does feature a lot of fish dishes. Beside of different herring dishes like Matjes or Bismarckhering, Green Herring ('green' meaning fresh, hence not marinated, fried or cured) is also very common. A fried herring becomes a Brathering if it is marinated in vinegar after frying. Another famous fish dish is Räucheraal, which is a smoked eel and was already featured by street vendors since the early 19th century and could be found on the dinner menus of many local restaurants. The dish Finkenwerder Scholle is another speciality which is considered typical for the cuisine of Hamburg as well as Pannfisch with baked potatoes, a dish that features fish leftovers in a mustard sauce. Carp is traditionally served for Christmas dinner or on New Year's Eve, and the omnipresent Fischbrötchen is a roll with raw or fried fish inside that is sold as street food. =Soups and stews= Hamburger Hummersuppe One of the most popular soups in Hamburg, is the creamy lobster soup called Hamburger Hummersuppe which is served with a small amount of whipped cream and garnished with dill. A variation of this soup is the small shrimp soup Hamburg style, called Hamburger Krabbensuppe. Adding a dash of Cognac to both variations is optional but very common. The Hamburg variation on the Steckrübeneintopf which is popular all over North Germany is called 'Hamburger National'. Birnen, Bohnen und Speck, Labskaus, and the are further examples for the stews of Hamburg of which the latter is a vegetable stew with root, green vegetables and dried fruit which rose to supraregional popularity due to the controversy if it has to be served with or without eel. However, the preparation without eel is considered folk-etymological. =Snack food= Knackwurst as typically served as a snack in Hamburg, Germany, on classic dishware Popular for breakfast or as a snack: Krabbentoast. Like in any larger city, there is a great variety of snacks available in Hamburg. Apart from international products like Doner Kebab, Asian cuisine, or pizza, there are some snacks with a local or regional tradition. Next to the popular fish sandwiches which are called Fischbrötchen, toasted white bread with small, brown shrimps from the North Sea called Krabbentoast is very popular either for breakfast or as a snack at lunch time. Other popular snacks are Currywurst which comes in different styles made with different kind of sausages, or Knackwurst. =Main dishes= Roast beef Hamburg style with all the goings A main dish of Hamburg cuisine which originates in the bourgeois cuisine owes its development to the intensive trade with Portugal. It features oxtail in Madeira wine and is nowadays rather used as soup course instead of the main dish. Other important dishes are Schwarzsauer (a sour kind of blood soup), Himmel, Erde und Hölle and poultry dishes using chicken, duck and goose. Especially 'Stubenküken' are considered a forgotten speciality and is a dish using young chicken which were bred in spring. As it holds true for the whole neighbouring area of North Germany the cuisine of Hamburg does feature a lot of kale in its dishes as well which is reflected in famous dishes e.g. Grünkohl or Kohlrouladen mit Wirsing. =Dessert= Rote Grütze with vanilla sauce Typical sweet dishes of the cuisine of Hamburg are Rote Grütze with milk, vanilla sauce, vanilla ice cream, or liquid cream, Fliederbeersuppe (elderberry soup), Großer Hans (a flour dumpling eaten with cherry compote and bread pudding with lemon sauce.siehe Hamburgisches Kochbuch von 1798, zitiert nach Rita Bake, Birgit Kiupel: Sach- und Gefühlslexikon in alphabetischer Reihenfolge von Abschied bis Zuckerbäcker, Hamburg 1987, Seite 19 =Baked goods= A typical Franzbrötchen Black and white cookies are popular along with Kaffee und Kuchen The original bread roll of Hamburg is called \\"Rundstück\\" (lit.: round piece) and those that were not eaten for breakfast are plated with slices of roasted pork, smothered in sauce and are then called \\"Rundstück warm\\" for lunch (lit.: round piece warm). A famous bread is Schwarzbrot, a dark and fluffy whole wheat bread. For tea (or 'coffee and cake' as teatime is called in Germany) Kopenhagener are served which is filled with jam or marzipan. Another famous baked good for 'coffee and cake' is the traditional apple pie of Hamburg which is prepared by pan frying the apples and deglazing them with white wine before baking the actual cake. \\"Black and white cookies\\", either self-made or bought in local pastry shops, are popular in Hamburg, too. Franzbrötchen are also very popular: Despite the name contains the word Brötchen, it is not a roll but a kind of flaky pastry typical only for Hamburg and baked with much butter and cinnamon. Locals enjoy it for breakfast, too. In Christmas times, there's Klöben (also called 'Stollen' in other parts of Germany), a bread-shaped pastry made of yeast dough with raisins and succade. 'Braune Kuchen' (lit.: brown cakes) are crisp rectangular biscuits baked with molassess and gingerbread spice that are based on a recipe developed back in 1782 from the Konditorei Kemm.Sebastian Husen: Braune Kuchen. In: Franklin Kopitzsch, Daniel Tilgner: Hamburg Lexikon. 3. Auflage. Ellert und Richter, Hamburg 2005, , Seite 83 'Weiße Kuchen' (lit.: white cakes) however are a kind of fried dough foods. The so-called Heißwecken (lit.: hot rolls) are a yeast dough product with raisins that are dusted with confectioner's sugar and filled with cream and are traditionally eating during lent. =Candy and sweets= Cubes of Hamburger Speck Hamburger Speck is a sort of candy made out of foamed sugar with various coatings. The color is often reminiscent of the colors of Hamburg, red-white-red. The name refers to the similarity with bacon (or speck).Franklin Kopitzsch, Daniel Tilgner (ed.): Hamburg Lexikon. Ellert & Richter, Hamburg 2011, , p. 295 Drinks=Beer= Beer has been brewed in Hamburg since the early 14th century. In the year 1375 there were 457 breweries, 270 of which also exported beer. The yearly production was about 170.000 hectoliters. In the centuries that followed beer exports increased due to quality enhancements because of production changes (more wheat beer was produced and the production of dark beer and red ale decreased). The recipe was guarded like a secret treasure and since the time of the Hanseatic League which opened the trade the export of beer formed the base of Hamburg's wealth, the city being considered the 'brewery of the Hanse'.Jörgen Bracker: Die wirtschaftliche Bedeutung des Bierexports. In: Hamburg. Von den Anfängen bis zur Gegenwart. Wendemarken einer Stadtgeschichte, Hamburg 1988, Seite 64 f. In the 16th century 600 breweries are noted in historical sources which exported the beer as far as Sweden and Russia and since the 17th century even bock beer was exported from Hamburg. In the 18th century both production and export decreased and the beer market did not recover until the fast growth of population in the late 19th century. In 1890 there were only 32 breweries and nowadays there are only two old breweries in existence, the Holsten Brewery and the Gröninger brewery.Wir über uns =Spirits= The predominant kinds of schnapps until the mid of the 20th century were Köm, the northern German version of Aquavit or Korn (distilled from rye or wheat). The small island of Neuwerk in the North Sea, which is belongs to Hamburg, is famous for producing its own Aquavit. Especially the trade with South America brought Rum to the city and is featured in the Grog, a popular drink not only amongst seamen. =Import of wine= The main focus was laid on the import of wines from Médoc which were stored in barrels with little temperature variabilities in a humid and foggy climate to mature and incorporated the typical 'Rotspon' flavor. =Import of coffee and tea= The different varieties of coffee and tea became popular in Hamburg in the 17th century. It was widely consumed and several coffee houses developed of which the first one is documented in the year 1677.Franklin Kopitzsch: Kaffeehäuser. In: Franklin Kopitzsch, Daniel Tilgner: Hamburg Lexikon. 3. Auflage. Ellert und Richter, Hamburg 2005, , Seite 263 Even nowadays, the majority of the coffee and tea import of Germany is managed by the port of Hamburg. The varieties are also mixed (and in case of coffee beans roasted) in Hamburg and are then distributed all over Germany and other parts of continental Europe.

Johnson's Presidential speech writer and staff assistant from 1967 to 1969. Middleton was also director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum from 1971 until 2002, and led the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation from 1993 until 2004.  Early life and education  Harry Middleton was born in Centerville, Iowa, on October 24, 1921. Following two years of study at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas from 1941 to 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving in World War II and later as an officer in the Korean war. He completed his education at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, earning a BA in Journalism. In his career as a professional writer, Middleton worked as a reporter for the Associated Press and a news editor for Architectural Forum and published articles and stories in Reader's Digest, Sports Illustrated, Collier's, Cosmopolitan, and Life.  Working with LBJ  It was in 1966, while Middleton was working on a report for the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service, that President Lyndon B. Johnson met Middleton and hired him as a speechwriter. From January 1967 until January 20, 1969, he served as Staff Assistant to President Johnson in the White House, writing speeches for the President and drafting messages to Congress delineating need for new legislation. Following the inauguration ceremony of Richard Nixon on January 20, 1969, Middleton returned to the LBJ Ranch in Stonewall, Texas, with Lyndon Johnson in the role of Special Assistant to the former President. From 1969 until May 18, 1970, he worked with Johnson on two books: The Choices We Face, (March 1969) and The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963–1969 (1971). In 1970, Johnson named him the director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum (LBJ Library) on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. The building and grounds for the LBJ Library, the first to be located on a university campus, were donated by the University of Texas and are operated by the National Archives of the General Services Administration. The Library opened on May 22, 1971 and Middleton was responsible for its direction for the next 31 years until his retirement in 2002. Middleton also served as Executive Director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation from 1993 until 2004. Harry Middleton, Lady Bird Johnson, former President Lyndon Baines Johnson in front of the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas – March 15, 1971 Although Middleton had no credentials as an archivist, Johnson told him that he was a capable writer and supported his appointment. Historian Michael Beschloss called Middleton \\"the Joe DiMaggio of Presidential Library directors,\\" Former President Gerald Ford said, \\"President Johnson would be proud of the leadership Harry has provided...in setting standards that have transformed the Presidential Library system.\\" In 1971, at Johnson's request, Middleton worked with former National Security Advisor Walt Rostow to prepare a rationale that Johnson could present to President Nixon that would persuade him to expedite declassification of foreign policy documents of Johnson's administration, including documents concerning the Vietnam War. Johnson died before he was able to meet with Nixon. However, under Middleton's direction, the Library established a reputation of leadership in declassification and openness, declassifying and opening hundreds of thousands of pages of historical material. In 1993, Middleton made the decision to release recordings of the telephone conversations Johnson made throughout his presidency. Although Johnson had stipulated that the recordings be sealed until 50 years after his death (the year 2023), Middleton consulted with the President's widow, Lady Bird Johnson, about releasing them sooner, and she said the decision was his to make. The conversations, most of which were recorded on a Dictaphone machine, cover a variety of issues, including foreign policy, the Vietnam War and peace negotiations, legislation, civil rights, the economy, politics, labor issues, appointments, and press relations. Consequently, 642 hours of secretly taped telephone conversations have been made available to the public, providing insight into Johnson's legislative skills and substantially elevating his historical standing as a president.  Later life  (L-R) Former President Carter with Harry Middleton, former Director of LBJ Presidential Library at the Civil Rights Summit in 2014 Lady Bird Johnson established the Harry Middleton Lectureship in 1994 to honor the career, loyalty and legacy of Middleton and to enrich the learning experiences of UT students and the Austin community. Lecturers include former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Tom Brokaw, David Mamet, and novelist Jodi Picoult. In 2002, to honor Middleton's contributions to the Presidential Library system and to support scholarly work in Presidential studies, Lady Bird Johnson created the Harry Middleton Fellowship. Each year, the LBJ Foundation appropriates $10,000 - $12,000 to support scholars researching Presidential policy. From 2004–2013, Middleton taught a class to University of Texas honors students called \\"The Johnson Years,\\" frequently inviting former members of the Johnson administration to lecture. C-SPAN recorded the final class session in April 2013. On July 14, 2007, Middleton gave a eulogy at Lady Bird Johnson's funeral in Austin, Texas, calling her \\"a special mix of grace and steel.\\" Middleton died on January 20, 2017.  Awards  Middleton was awarded the Presidential Rank of Meritorious Executive in the Senior Executive Service in 1991. The citation reads: \\"For sustained superior accomplishment in management of programs of the United States Government and for noteworthy achievement of quality and efficiency in public service.\\" In presenting the award, Don W. Wilson, Archivist of the United States, cited Mr. Middleton's leadership in expanding the \\"cultural, educational, and archival activities in a time of shrinking Federal resources. This has been accomplished through an unusually effective private partnership with the Lyndon B. Johnson Foundation.\\" Middleton also received the Anti-Defamation League's Torch of Liberty Award, and The University of Texas Presidential Citation.

They were first detected in 2010 through the use of genome-wide techniques such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. eRNAs can be subdivided into two main classes: 1D eRNAs and 2D eRNAs, which differ primarily in terms of their size, polyadenylation state, and transcriptional directionality. The expression of a given eRNA seems to correlate with the activity of its corresponding enhancer in a context-dependent fashion. Increasing evidence suggests that eRNAs actively play a role in transcriptional regulation in cis and in trans, and while their mechanisms of action remain unclear, a few models have been proposed. Discovery Enhancers as sites of extragenic transcription were initially discovered in genome-wide studies that identified enhancers as common regions of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) binding and non-coding RNA transcription. The level of RNA pol II–enhancer interaction and RNA transcript formation were found to be highly variable among these initial studies. Using explicit chromatin signature peaks, a significant proportion (~70%) of extragenic RNA Pol II transcription start sites were found to overlap enhancer sites in murine macrophages. Out of 12,000 neuronal enhancers in the mouse genome, almost 25% of the sites were found to bind RNA Pol II and generate transcripts. These eRNAs, unlike messenger RNAs (mRNAs), lacked modification by polyadenylation, were generally short and non-coding, and were bidirectionally transcribed. Later studies revealed the transcription of another type of eRNAs, generated through unidirectional transcription, that were longer and contained a poly A tail. Furthermore, eRNA levels were correlated with mRNA levels of nearby genes, suggesting the potential regulatory and functional role of these non-coding enhancer RNA molecules. Biogenesis eRNA Biogenesis =Summary= eRNAs are transcribed from DNA sequences upstream and downstream of extragenic enhancer regions. Previously, several model enhancers have demonstrated the capability to directly recruit RNA Pol II and general transcription factors and form the pre-initiation complex (PIC) prior to the transcription start site at the promoter of genes. In certain cell types, activated enhancers have demonstrated the ability to both recruit RNA Pol II and also provide a template for active transcription of their local sequences. Depending on the directionality of transcription, enhancer regions generate two different types of non-coding transcripts, 1D-eRNAs and 2D-eRNAs. The nature of the pre-initiation complex and specific transcription factors recruited to the enhancer may control the type of eRNAs generated. After transcription, the majority of eRNAs remain in the nucleus. In general, eRNAs are very unstable and actively degraded by the nuclear exosome. Not all enhancers are transcribed, with non-transcribed enhancers greatly outnumbering the transcribed ones in the order of magnitude of dozens of thousands in every given cell type. =1D eRNAs= In most cases, unidirectional transcription of enhancer regions generates long (>4kb) and polyadenylated eRNAs. Enhancers that generate polyA+ eRNAs have a lower H3K4me1/me3 ratio in their chromatin signature than 2D-eRNAs. PolyA+ eRNAs are distinct from long multiexonic poly transcripts (meRNAs) that are generated by transcription initiation at intragenic enhancers. These long non-coding RNAs, which accurately reflect the host gene’s structure except for the alternative first exon, display poor coding potential. As a result, polyA+ 1D-eRNAs may represent a mixed group of true enhancer-templated RNAs and multiexonic RNAs. =2D eRNAs= Bidirectional transcription at enhancer sites generates comparatively shorter (0.5-2kb) and non-polyadenylated eRNAs. Enhancers that generate polyA- eRNAs have a chromatin signature with a higher H3K4me1/me3 ratio than 1D-eRNAs. In general, enhancer transcription and production of bidirectional eRNAs demonstrate a strong correlation of enhancer activity on gene transcription. Proposed mechanisms of function Proposed Mechanisms of eRNA Function The notions that not all enhancers are transcribed at the same time and that eRNA transcription correlates with enhancer-specific activity support the idea that individual eRNAs carry distinct and relevant biological functions. However, there is still no consensus on the functional significance of eRNAs. Furthermore, eRNAs can easily be degraded through exosomes and nonsense-mediated decay, which limits their potential as important transcriptional regulators. To date, four main models of eRNA function have been proposed, each supported by different lines of experimental evidence. =Transcriptional Noise= Since multiple studies have shown that RNA Pol II can be found at a very large number of extragenic regions, it is possible that eRNAs simply represent the product of random “leaky” transcription and carry no functional significance. The non-specific activity of RNA Pol II would therefore allow extragenic transcriptional noise at sites where chromatin is already in an open and transcriptionally competent state. This would explain even tissue-specific eRNA expression as open sites are tissue-specific as well. =Transcription-dependent effects= RNA Pol II-mediated gene transcription induces a local opening of chromatin state through the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and other histone modifiers that promote euchromatin formation. It was proposed that the presence of these enzymes could also induce an opening of chromatin at enhancer regions, which are usually present at distant locations but can be recruited to target genes through looping of DNA. In this model, eRNAs are therefore expressed in response to RNA Pol II transcription and therefore carry no biological function. =Functional activity in cis= While the two previous models implied that eRNAs were not functionally relevant, this mechanism states that eRNAs are functional molecules that exhibit cis activity. In this model, eRNAs can locally recruit regulatory proteins at their own site of synthesis. Supporting this hypothesis, transcripts originating from enhancers upstream of the Cyclin D1 gene are thought to serve as adaptors for the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases. It was found that depletion of these eRNAs led to Cyclin D1 transcriptional silencing. =Functional activity in trans= The last model involves transcriptional regulation by eRNAs at distant chromosomal locations. Through the differential recruitment of protein complexes, eRNAs can affect the transcriptional competency of specific loci. Evf-2 represents a good example of such trans regulatory eRNA as it can induce the expression of Dlx2, which in turn can increase the activity of the Dlx5 and Dlx6 enhancers. Trans-acting eRNAs might also be working in cis, and vice versa. Experimental detection The detection of eRNAs is fairly recent (2010) and has been made possible through the use of genome-wide investigation techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq). RNA-seq permits the direct identification of eRNAs by matching the detected transcript to the corresponding enhancer sequence through bioinformatic analyses. ChIP-seq represents a less direct way to assess enhancer transcription but can also provide crucial information as specific chromatin marks are associated with active enhancers. Although some data remain controversial, the consensus in the literature is that the best combination of histone post-translational modifications at active enhancers is made of H2AZ, H3K27ac, and a high ratio of H3K4me1 over H3K4me3. ChIP experiments can also be conducted with antibodies that recognize RNA Pol II, which can be found at sites of active transcription. The experimental detection of eRNAs is complicated by their low endogenous stability conferred by exosome degradation and nonsense-mediated decay. Run-on assay using high throughput sequencing technique is another way of detecting eRNAs. Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) can detect RNAs that are being actively transcribed and has resolution of up to one base-pair. Nonetheless, the fact that eRNAs tend to be expressed from active enhancers might make their detection a useful tool to distinguish between active and inactive enhancers. Implications in development and disease Evidence that eRNAs cause downstream effects on the efficiency of enhancer activation and gene transcription suggests its functional capabilities and potential importance. The transcription factor p53 has been demonstrated to bind enhancer regions and generate eRNAs in a p53-dependent manner. In cancer, p53 plays a central role in tumor suppression as mutations of the gene are shown to appear in 50% of tumors. These p53-bound enhancer regions (p53BERs) are shown to interact with multiple local and distal gene targets involved in cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, eRNAs generated by the activation of p53BERs are shown to be required for efficient transcription of the p53 target genes, indicating the likely important regulatory role of eRNAs in tumor suppression and cancer. Variations in enhancers have been implicated in human disease but a therapeutic approach to manipulate enhancer activity is currently not possible. With the emergence of eRNAs as important components in enhancer activity, powerful therapeutic tools such as RNAi may provide promising routes to target disruption of gene expression.

His name was mentioned in the series of Srivijayan inscriptions dated from late 7th century CE dubbed as the \\"Siddhayatra inscriptions\\", describing his sacred journey to acquire blessings and also to conquer neighboring areas. He reigned around the turn of late 7th century to early 8th century, more precisely in the period between 671 and 702 CE.  Biography  According to I Tsing, a Chinese Buddhist monk that visited Srivijaya in 671 and stayed there for 6 months, he was impressed by the generosity, kindness and hospitality demonstrated by the king of Srivijaya. The king mentioned in I Tsing report was later linked to the king mentioned in oldest Srivijayan inscription, also from 7th century, dated 682 CE, the Kedukan Bukit inscription discovered in Palembang, and thought to be referring to the same person. However, later historians discount that interpretation of the inscriptions.Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro, Nugroho Notosusanto, (1992), Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Jaman kuna, PT Balai Pustaka, The Kedukan Bukit inscription dated 605 saka (683 CE), mentioned a king titled Dapunta Hyang who performed a Siddhayatra (sacred journey) by the boat. He departed from Minanga Tamwan accompanied with 20,000 soldiers heading to Matajap and conquering several areas. Other inscriptions tell of the Siddhayatra journey and Srivijayan conquests on surrounding areas, such as Kota Kapur discovered in Bangka island (686 CE), Karang Brahi discovered in Jambi Hulu (686 CE) and Palas Pasemah discovered in southern Lampung, all mentions the same event. From all of these inscriptions, it was concluded that Dapunta Hyang established the Srivijayan empire after defeating his enemies in Jambi, Palembang, Southern Lampung and Bangka island, and he even went further to launch a military campaign against Bhumi Java that probably contributed to the decline of the Tarumanagara kingdom in West Java.

Sugata Mitra, an education scientist, first popularized the term in 1999, referencing an approach he developed following his Hole in the Wall experiments. Mitra's experiments demonstrated that groups of kids could learn to navigate computers and the internet by themselves, and \\"research since then has continued to support his startling conclusion that groups of children, with access to the Internet, can learn almost anything by themselves.\\" Starting in 2014, he's worked with and through the School in the Cloud project to support the development of SOLEs around the world, adding \\"Granny\\" mentors and Big Questions as key components of such programs. Initial experiments and Project SOLE One of the things that was learned through the program is that children are often smarter than given credit for. Rather than providing lectures or spoon-feeding information to the students, it is better to ask \\"engaging, provocative questions\\" and let them work out the answers. It was also determined to be good to let the students self-direct in the areas that are of interest to them, with the idea that students will then often stretch to comprehend information that might have otherwise been too difficult for them. Other findings were that the educational experience is enhanced through collaboration and teamwork, that speech-to-text software is an effective tool for learning to speak a new language, and that tests asking students to solve real-life problems are more effective at prompting students to apply and demonstrate their learning than standard tests. The first student in India to use the program was Gouri Chindarkar (born about 1996) from Sangli in Maharashtra. She learned about the program through a mentor, an American woman named Ann Thomas, who met with her at 6:30 in the morning. She used a computer for the first time, and her schoolwork delivered in English; her native language is Marathi. Gouri Chindarkar has since studied Computing Engineering at the Kankavali campus of Mumbai University and she was selected as one of the BBC's 100 Women in 2016. Project SOLE was begun in 10 locations in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, with an 11th one in Sindhudurg rural area of Maharashtra over a period of 2 years, 2008 to 2009. It is not clear to what extent the learning is effective over the long-term.  The School In The Cloud  In their own words, \\"The School in the Cloud platform was originally launched at the 2014 TED conference to help accelerate this research by helping educators — be they teachers, parents or community leaders — to run their own SOLEs and to contribute to the global experiment by sharing their experiences with others. It is now managed by SOLE Central at Newcastle University, a global hub for SOLE research and practice directed by Sugata Mitra.\\" They are currently experimenting to refine and increase access to education programs that blend the SOLE approach of encouraging student groups to self-direct online learning with lessons from the Philosophy For Children (P4C) project. Adaptation within institutionalized education Though Mitra's initial experiments focused on children living in unstable environments and in poverty, his findings inspired educators in a wide variety of environments to adapt his work. Teachers in both traditional and progressive environments have found ways to incorporate the SOLE approach in their work, whether for the span of a lesson or a semester. One prominent education blog suggests, \\"Consider it a tool for introducing and generating interest in a new topic, as well as broadening your students’ understanding of a familiar topic.\\" In this context, the SOLE is just one element in a larger inquiry or project-based learning cycle. Adaptation beyond institutionalized education For some, the initial SOLE projects showed the immense potential for learning in settings where students leverage technology and social learning to explore their interests with minimal interference. The US nonprofit Black Mountain SOLE opened a community center \\"inspired by the idea that human curiosity is the best motivation for learning\\" and identifying as an adaptation from earlier SOLE projects. Agile Learning Centers and a number of the projects that are part of the Alliance for Self-Directed Education also consider themselves to either be or be inspired by SOLEs.

Cyprus lies on the southern border of the Eurasian Plate and on the southern margin of the Anatolian Plate. The southern margin of the Anatolian Plate is in collision with the African Plate, which has created the uplift of the Cyprus arc and Cyprus itself. Bedrock geology Cyprus is commonly divided into four bedrock units, which are illustrated in the small inset map at the right. From north to south they are: *Keryneia Terrane (blue) *Troodos Ophiolite (red), surrounded by the Circum Troodos Sedimentary Succession (orange) *Mamonia Terrane (green) =Keryneia Terrane= The Keryneia Terrane occupies the northern margin of Cyprus, stretching from Cape Kormakitis in the west to Cape Andreas in the east. The terrane is a sequence of Permian to recent sediments. The carbonate rocks are divided into the Dhikomo, the Hilarion and the Sykhari Formation. =Troodos Ophiolite= A outcrop of the sheeted dyke complex of the Troodos ophiolite The Troodos Ophiolite crops out in the central part of Cyprus in a northwest to southeast striking band. The lithospheric mantle crops out in the Troodos mountains and in the Limassol Forest, Akapnou Forest, on the Akamas Peninsula and near Troullo. This slab of oceanic lithosphere was formed around 90 million years ago as part of the Neotethys seafloor (Meliata- Maliac-Vardar). The Troodos Ophiolite is exceptional for the completeness of the section of oceanic lithosphere. The crust is composed of sheeted dykes, pillow basalts and marine sediments. The sediments are composed of deep-water shales and radiolarite. The mantle parts of the lithosphere are made of harzburgite and dunite (both peridotites), with about 50 to 80% of the minerals now transformed into serpentinite. =Mamonia Terrane= The Mamonia Terrane or Mamonia Complex is an assemblage of volcanic, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Outcrops are only found on the southwestern end of Cyprus (Paphos district). It is thought that this assemblage was deposited between the Middle Triassic and the Upper Cretaceous and was thrust on to the southern margin of Cyprus from the Maastrichtian onwards well into the Cenozoic. The Mamonia Terrane is divided into the Diarizos Group, the Agios-Fotios Group and the Agia-Varvara Formation. =Circum Troodos= The sediments that are autochthonous to Cyprus are called the Circum Troodos unit because they surround the Troodos. They were deposited between the Upper Cretaceous to the Pleistocene. Outcrops cover most of the island, with the exception of the Troodos mountains, which rise free. As a result of uplift the sediments become progressively more shallow marine.

He was appointed on 13 March 1640 and was Governor until 1 August 1640. He was succeeded by Jan Thyszoon Payart. In 1637 Rajasingha II, king of Kandy approached the Dutch East India Company for military support against the Portuguese occupiers. Admiral Adam Westerwold was sent to help the king to capture fort Batticaloa. Coster had arrived in April 1638 in Trincomalee, which was already in Dutch hands, and sailed for Batticaloa with three ships and 180 men, where he waited for the arrival of Westerwold. The admiral arrived with four ships on May 10, while the troops of the king arrived the next day from inland. On 14 May the Portuguese surrendered the fort and were deported to the Coromandel coast. The next week king Rajasingha signed an agreement with the VOC to allow a monopoly in the trade in cinnamon, amongst others, in exchange for help driving the Portuguese out of his kingdom. After Westerwold left, Coster remained in fort Batticaloa with 100 men.Ceylon at vocsite.nl (in Dutch) The murder of Willem Jacobszoon Coster In early 1640 Kandy and the VOC had signed another agreement and decided to capture Galle from the Portuguese. Coster arrived with his troops on 8 March, while on 11 March the king's troops and three VOC ships arrived with 400 sailors and soldiers. On 13 March 1640, the combined troops under command of Coster overpowered the fort Santiago and took over the city. This fort was subsequently renamed Akersloot after the birthplace of Coster. The High Council decided to install Coster as Governor of Ceylon, with Galle as residence, where he had a garrison of 200 men. As part of the agreement, Trincomalee was returned to Kandy. When Rajasingha learned that Coster was reluctant to return more of the conquered land, he had him and his seven companions murdered near Nilgala on the way back from Kandy to Batticaloa in August 1640. Coster's wife was one of the first Dutch women to arrive in Ceylon, in November 1640. She did not know that her husband had been murdered and returned to Batavia.

It was the first such camp on the island since World War I. The opening of the camp Following an announcement of the planned camp in the Manx newspapers in the second week of May 1940, official letters were sent out on 12 May to inform occupants of all the houses along the Mooragh Promenade that their houses were to be requisitioned to form a camp to intern enemy aliens. The residents had to be out of their houses by 18 May, and they were to leave behind all furniture, bedding, linen, cutlery, crockery and utensils. Queen’s Pier, Ramsey – in May 1940 it was the disembarkation point for the first internees Some thirty boarding houses and hotels along the Mooragh Promenade were requisitioned, as well as a number of bungalows nearby to be used for billeting the military guard. The camp also included the Mooragh golf links, which were to be used as a recreation ground for the internees. The road leading from the swing bridge to the Mooragh Park was to remain open to the public, although part of the roadway was included within the compound. A double row of barbed wire fencing was erected as the perimeter of the camp. On the seaward side the fence extended to within a few feet of the sea wall, allowing a narrow alleyway for the use of the patrolling guards.http://www.airfieldinformationexchange.org/ On 26 May ten officers and 150 men belonging to the Royal Welch Fusiliers arrived at Ramsey on the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company ship, the Castle Rushen, ready to take up guard of the camp, under Captain Alexander.Island of Barbed Wire, Connery Chappell, Corgi Books, London, p. 40 On the following day, Monday 27 May, the armed military force took up position guarding the length of Queen's Pier, ready to receive the first shipment of internees. 823 men arrived on the Belgian cross- Channel steamer Princess Josephine Charlotte, and they were despatched in batches to the base of the pier and assembled along the South Promenade. A large body of police from Douglas also assisted in the marshalling arrangement as large crowds of local people stood by to watch. The guards then accompanied the prisoners, some of them whistling, as they walked along the South Promenade and the quay before crossing over the swing bridge to the camp.Chappell, p. 42 The Courier later reported that: > \\"...it was seen that the aliens were mostly youthful or middle-aged. There > were practically no elderly men among them. As they came ashore they carried > with them their belongings in suitcases, attaché cases and bundles on their > backs. They were a mixed lot: some well dressed and bearing signs of > affluence, others were of lowlier mien and wore canvas shoes. One alien had > his dog with him: another – somewhat optimistically – was carrying a fishing > rod. Another carried a typewriter in his > hand.\\"http://www.airfieldinformationexchange.org/ Later changes The camp changed over time, with new countries joining the war and a flow of releases of the internees who were deemed to pose no threat to the Allies. In around April 1941 Mooragh Camp received an influx of internees from Peel as Peveril Camp was cleared to make ready for British fascists.Chappell, p.123 In November 1942 180 Finns moved to the camp when the Palace Camp in Douglas closed.Chappell, p.193 The Finns were mainly sailors who had been captured, serving aboard Swedish cargo ships that had undergone inspections by the Royal Navy. Although many were pro-British, the majority were pro-Nazi, an imbalance which only increased with time as more pro-British internees were released. By April 1943 the Finns made up a quarter of the camp’s total population, the rest being made up of Germans and Italians. The different nationalities were allocated houses in different sections of the promenade separated off by barbed wire. The sections were known as 'F' Camp for the Finns, 'L' Camp for the Germans and 'N' Camp for the Italians. It stayed in this format until the camp’s closure on 2 August 1945.Chappell, p.232 Camp life Each boarding house constituted an independent unit with its own internees taking up positions such as of leader, kitchen staff, cleaners, orderlies and cooks. There was one recreation room (the only one heated), a dining room, toilet, bathroom and the bedrooms. Each camp compound also had a group of boarding houses allocated for special purposes such as workshops for tailors, toy makers and watchmakers, professional activities which were first permitted shortly after the camp was formed. Another group of buildings featured a library which internees were free to use, as well as a canteen, wash-house, drying room and storehouses.http://www.airfieldinformationexchange.org/ After initial suspicion of the internees relaxed on the island, in both residents and the authorities alike, employment outside of the camps was permitted. This was chiefly as farm labour, helping to fill a shortfall by 1943 of almost 800 men brought about by local call-ups to the military.Records from June 1943 show the number of male farm workers down to 1,027 from a figure of 1,800 in 1940, recorded in Chappell, p.216 The camp was exceptional on the island for having free access to news from the camp’s opening, with 36 copies of the Daily Mail and of the Ramsey Courier being made available daily.Ramsey Police note of 4 June 1940, recorded in Chappell, p.78 Like other camps on the island, Mooragh published a camp newspaper, the Mooragh Times, in which were published poems and other pieces written by internees in both German and English. In addition to this there was published a booklet entitled Stimmen hinter Stracheldraht, or \\"Voices behind Barbed Wire\\", a collection of works from internees within Mooragh and from other camps on the island.JPG images of Stimmen hinter Stracheldraht available on http://www.edwardvictor.com Amongst the pieces published was a poem, Mooragh, July 1940, by F. F. Beiber, which offers a picture of the mood of many internees in Mooragh: The view north along the beach from the location of Mooragh Camp > Beyond barbed wire > The sea, > And the sun’s last fire > Burning up a tree > And a cottage on the green hill. > Gulls idle on the beach, > Then rise into the air and cry. > The field across the bay we cannot reach, > We can but pace our cage and let our hungry eye > Take in far loveliness which will > Remain > Beyond our sadness and beyond despair, > Beyond our stubborn hope, beyond our fair > And puzzled sense of justice. They will stand, > This bay, their pier, this beach, this sea, > This distant friendliness of wooded land - > To bid farewell to us when we are free.JPG image on > http://www.edwardvictor.com > Attempted escapes and other disturbances Mooragh Promenade, with the remnants of the single barbed wire fence posts that ran around the recreation area of the camp An escape from the camp was achieved at around 9.30 pm on Wednesday 15 October 1941 by three pro-Nazi Dutchmen, two ships' officers from the mercantile marine and a civil air pilot. Having been planning the escape for two months, in which time they had studied the movements of the guards and built a ladder to get over the fence, they were forced to carry out the escape quickly and in terrible weather conditions as they had discovered that they were to be transferred to Peveril Camp in Peel the following day. Having previously studied the harbour on their official walks, they quickly found a dinghy and paddled out to the yacht Irene. Despite having been immobilised, as required by war regulations, the men were able to steer the yacht out of the harbour on the ebb tide and then put up the sails when beyond the harbour. Their intention was to sail to Ireland, but this was near to impossible in the weather conditions, a south-westerly Force 10 gale. Once their absence was spotted, an extensive search was carried out on land, at sea and by air. The yacht was spotted by the RAF and monitored without any attempt being made to board her. The yacht finally landed at a creek near Eskmeels, south of St Bees Head, Cumberland, some time around midnight, having been driven hopelessly off course during the storm. The three men were arrested by the military and held in Whitehaven until the next morning when a party of Manx police arrived on the first boat into Fleetwood. As was the norm for such cases, the men returned to the Isle of Man to face civil trial for the theft of the boat, valued at £300. They were each sentenced to six-month prison sentences, which were spent in the island's prison. Upon their release they were returned to internment, this time at Peveril camp.Chappell, pp. 175–179 By the start of 1943 there were a large number of Finns in the camp, many of whom were of a sort that was \\"often homeless, semi-literate and semi-vagabond.\\"Chappell, pp. 195 Their section of the camp had become a rough and dangerous place where violence often broke out. This was not helped by their strengthening the alcohol allowed to them by adding the likes of hair oil, boot-blacking and wood polish to it. The raucous and dangerous activities of the camp increased around the date of Hitler's birthday on 20 April, at which point the canteen was looted of all of its alcohol; this only increased the drunkenness and violence. On the morning of 20 April a 26-year-old Finnish man carried a bucket of dirty water from his own house over to the house next door, where he threw it over the face of a man who had been standing there by the entrance to the house. After a moment of shock this 36-year-old man pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed the younger man in the chest. The knife penetrated the man's heart, and he died moments later, having staggered back to fall on the pavement outside his own house. A mob then formed which proceeded to severely beat the older man, but he escaped serious harm by running out into the protection of the guards when they opened the gates in order to enter to stem the disturbance. In the civil trial that followed, the man was found not guilty of both murder and manslaughter: it was held that his life was in danger and so the knifing was carried out in self-defence. The man was then returned to the camp.Chappell, pp. 193–200 Mooragh Camp saw the final serious escape attempt made on the island during the war. A 28-year-old and a 32-year- old German had identified a section of the perimeter fence where the wire was simply looped round a boundary post and twisted together. On Sunday evening 11 March 1945 they untwisted the wire and made a gap wide enough to slip through. Unique amongst escapes on the island, they took with them some food. This enabled them to sleep rough in the fields without having to come into contact with anyone. After a week of cold and wet weather, during which up to 300 people took part in searches for them, at 7.45 am on Monday 18 March they walked into Bride post office and gave themselves up to the sub-postmistress, the first official they came across. In later interrogation, they both admitted that they knew that they could not realistically hope ever to have got off the island.Chappell, pp. 209–211 Significant internees * Peter Gellhorn (1912–2004), conductor, composer, pianist and teacher *Walter Joseph (1922–2003), photographer * Rabbi Werner van der Zyl (1902–84), founder of Leo Baeck College  See also  * : People interned in the Isle of Man during World War II  Notes and references  1940 establishments in the Isle of Man Buildings and structures in the Isle of Man Internment camps in the Isle of Man Ramsey, Isle of Man Unfree labor during World War II ","title":"Mooragh Internment Camp"},{"id":"38675110","text":"Kaliyuga Varadaraja Perumal Temple is a Hindu temple located at Kallankurichi in the Ariyalur district of Tamil Nadu, India.

She has also played for the national team, winning a silver medal at the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul. She retired soon afterwards, but staged a comeback in 2011, rejoining the national team, which went on to win the European championships, and then a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. President Joachim Gauck awarded the team Germany's highest sporting honour, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf). Biography Britt Tuna was born on 4 April 1963. She played wheelchair basketball for RSV Lahn- Dill, and the German national team which won the European Wheelchair Basketball Championship in 1987. At the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, Tuna was considered to be the strongest wheelchair basketball player in her 1.0-point class. The German team went through the tournament undefeated until the final match, which they lost to the United States, 38–31. Tuna was bitter about the defeat, which she blamed on a tactical error by the German coach. She later conceded, \\"So habe ihr diese Niederlage noch über Jahre nachgehangen\\" (\\"I indulged in this defeat for many years\\"). In the early 1990s, Tuna quit basketball to focus on her work. She married, changing her surname to Dillmann, and raised three children (Jana Dillmann, Charlotte Dillmann, Valentin Joshua Dillmann). But in the summer of 2009, Dillmann felt that she had become overweight and unfit. A low-carbohydrate diet and daily exercise at the gym, in the pool, and on the handcycle, saw her weight drop by in a year. Dillmann then decided to try wheelchair basketball again. She retrieved her old basketball chair, now somewhat mouldy and smelly, from the basement, and sought a game with her old team, RSV Lahn-Dill. Her debut game with the seconds saw the basketball officials reaching for their rulebooks to see if the old chair, of a type they had never seen, was still legal. Although RSV Lahn-Dill, eager to develop young players, would only let her play in the seconds, Dillmann caught the attention of national coach Holger Glinicki, who was looking for a top-notch 1.0-point player. In 2010, she rejoined the national team that she had played on before many of her new teammates were born. The team went on to win the European Championships in 2011. Dillmann's treatment contrasted with that of national teammate Gesche Schünemann. While Schünemann received endorsements and could train in the hall of RSV Lahn- Dill's Rivers Barracks, Dillmann got none, and trained outdoors. In June 2012 she was named as one of the team that competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London. At the age of 49, she was the oldest wheelchair basketball player there. In the Gold Medal match, the team faced the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, a team that had beaten them 48–46 in Sydney just a few months before. They defeated the Australians 44–58 in front of a crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal, the first that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball in 28 years. They were awarded a Silver Laurel Leaf by president Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were again named Team of the Year for 2012. For Dillmann, the gold medal victory removed the pain of the loss 24 years before. \\"Das hat mich versöhnt mit Seoul\\" (\\"This has reconciled me with Seoul\\") she said.

The show followed the adventures of the titular character, \\"Tom\\", who was the last remaining dinosaur, as he traveled around the world with the circus ran by his friends. The series followed their travels to different countries and landmarks including the Eiffel Tower, the canals of Venice, the Himalayas, and the Andes, whilst also following the attempts of two bungling criminals; Weedon and Hatch, to kidnap Tom for their boss, the equally cunning and greedy Mr Carter.

He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Leipzig and died on 30 October 1813 in Leipzig. His name is inscribed \\"DELMAS\\" on the east pillar of the Arc de Triomphe. Early Military Experiences At age eleven,Bulletin de la Société scientifique, historique et archéologique de la Corrèze, Volumes 90 à 91 he joined the regiment of Touraine and fought in the American war (this regiment, led by the Caribbean fleet and commanded by Admiral de Grasse, participated in the siege of Yorktown in October 1781). But his fiery temper soon threw him into disfavor despite the affection of his colonel, the Vicomte de Mirabeau. He was forced to leave the regiment in 1788. The Revolutionary Wars Unanimously chosen in 1791 to command the 1st battalion of the Volontaires de la Corrèze, he quickly gained a brilliant reputation in the army of the Rhine, where, one day, he went to seize a standard in the heart of the enemy's cavalry, killing with his own hands two hussars who defended it, and carried it back to the applause of all the vanguard troops. His skill and courage soon earned him the rank of brigadier general and command of all the infantry in the army's vanguard. Sent to Landau, Delmas was there threatened with dismissal by the representative of the people and, denounced by the Jacobins of that city, he managed to defend himself. Upon lifting of the siege, he went to fight in the line at Kaiserslautern. The Jacobins clubs of Spire renewed the denunciations of Landau. He finished his work gloriously on the field of battle, was made prisoner and taken to Paris; but the army soon reclaimed him. Returning as the head of a division and reconnoitering the city of Bois-le- Duc, its fortifications screened by marshes and flood, he suddenly found himself in front of Fort Orthen, having discovered a gap in the palisades and sensed a wavering on the part of the garrison. Then he said to his officers and eight hussars who were with him: \\"My friends, the fort is ours; who loves me follows me.\\" Spurring on his horse, he leaped the ditch, scaled the parapet and was the first to enter the fort. The 50 men who defended it, surprised by such audacity, were sabred, driven beyond the walls, and pursued onto the outer rampart which the general ordered shelled by the divisional artillery, firing from within Fort Orthen. This vigorous action led to the surrender of Fort Crevecoeur. Towards the end of 1796, Delmas command a division in the Army of the Rhine under the command of Moreau. He returned to France after a serious injury, went on to the Italian army, in the Battle of Tyrolese, took over from Joubert as commander-in-chief and held the post until the arrival of Scherer. He covered himself with glory and served brilliantly at the Battle of Magnano. The Director had offered him the command of the 1st Division (Paris), which he refused, the government presented with a suit of full armor in testimony of his brilliant services. He then returned to Italy as a lieutenant commander in chief. Consulate and the Napoleonic Wars In 1801 he took command of the troops in Piedmont. He was exiled for ten years because in 1802, attending an ostentatious Te Deum, First Consul Bonaparte asked his opinion about the ceremony, and Delmas replied \\"Beautiful capucinade.

Opened in 2007, it is located in a complex of seven industrial buildings from the late 19th century including the former brewery (and later winery) called \\"Moscow Bavaria\\". Alexander Brodsky is the coordinator of the project. Estate of Princess Volkonskaya Captain of the Guards regiment Mel’gunov, the first owner of a large estate situated in modern Mruzovskomu on the corner 4th streets BANKS, sold his estate to his own sister, Princess Catherine Volkonskaya. She was an outstanding Moscow lady and mistress of the Sukhanov Moscow region, and she had the nickname \\"Aunt Warrior\\" for her decisive power over her nephew, Peter Volkonsky, the Chief of Staff of Kutuzov. Oddly enough, many decorations of the building survived, and the house itself has not changed in appearance. Destroyed a century ago, the terrace is now restored. The building stands to the right of the entrance to Winzavod, a strong and solid center of the isolated beautiful portico, and in front there is an unusual semi-circular section. In 1805, Monin bought the manor. After four years in 1810, Nicephorus Prokofiev opened a malt-brewing factory on its territory. In early 1821, the estate passed on to Revel shopkeeper Frederick Danielson of the 2nd Guild, who added a wing to the residential part of the building, along with a two-story brewery and malt house. Long malt warehouses lined the other side of the lane. It is still possible to see the intricately intertwined initials, surrounded by a lush ornamentation of his son Ludwig Fridrikhovich in the tympanum of the portico of the main house. The garden façade focuses on elegant empire-style décor. In the 1840s, the factory, which now belonged to merchants of the first guild William Watson and Peter Dreier, was the second largest in Moscow, after \\"Trekhgorny\\". It brewed 57,000 rubles worth of beer each year. In 1855, this huge mansion and factory were owned by the famous \\"buy-em-up king\\" Vasily Aleksandrovich Kokorev. He made a fortune on wine sales, was involved in banking, was one of the pioneers of the Russian oil industry, founded several industrial companies and became one of the richest men in Russia. Kokorev collected paintings and was a patron of the arts: in the gallery, which he established in 1861, he placed more than 500 paintings, including paintings of Briullov, Levitsky, Borovikovsky Kiprensky. P. M. Tretyakov purchased some of them after the owner went bankrupt. For a while there was a factory here of wax, resins and stoppers (plugs/corks), belonging to N. F. Mamontov, which in 1858 was moved to its own premises near the Presnenskaya outpost, where it launched production of varnishes. Moscow Bavaria In the middle of the 19th century, the western part of the estate was cut off by the Moscow-Kursk railway. The malt building was on the corner of the newly paved lane and unexpectedly increased in urban value. The brewery kept all of its buildings. In the 1870s through the 1880s, brothers Ivan and Cyril Tarusin, the owners of “Moscow Bavaria” (Russian company for beer and mead in Moscow), acquired the factory. The plant was equipped with three steam engines with the total capacity of 45 horsepower, serviced 70 workers, and released a premium beer \\"Vienna Pure Number 1\\" for the price of 1 ruble and 60 kopecks per cask. The beverage \\"Black Velvet\\" was also famous. In 1909, part of the estate was acquired by legal representatives of the honorable H. S. Ledentsov, who used his resources for educational purposes; the main house was converted into a four-year college. By this time, the ancient manor had been significantly reduced in size: part of it was cut off by the rail line, and one part, which was given to Yauza, was sold to others. I. P. Goloulin was the head of the houses, and for many years the house was locally named Goloulinskii, and even all the area up to the waterfront Yauza was called Goloulinka. Across Hludovsky Lane (now BANKS travel, 6), there is a complex of charities associated with the name Gerasim Ivanovich Khludov. Egorievskii peasants, the Khludovs were weaving-artisans; the whole family was set apart in intelligence, enterprise, shrewdness, and hard work. After the death of the founder Ivan Ivanovich, his sons received 200 thousand rubles, which they used to expand production. Soon they were able to start trading in Moscow, and in 1847 they began construction of a cotton mill in Egoryevsk, which became one of the largest cotton mills in the suburbs of Moscow. Together with his brother Alexei Gerasim, Khludov handled the manufacturing and became one of the richest men in Russia. In 1865, Khludov established an office in Liverpool where he could buy raw materials and steam engines, which lasted for more than forty years. In 1874, they organized the \\"Partnership on Equal Footing\\" with a capital of 3 million rubles, and the owners themselves and their families were the only shareholders. The workday at the factory lasted 14 hours for adults and nine hours for children. M. E. Saltykov-Shchedrin dealt with the matter of lawlessness in the factory in the late fifties however, despite their work practices the Khludovs were also known as benefactors and patrons. Like Kokorev, Gerasim Khludov collected paintings by Perov, Aivazovsky, and Briullov; the painting “Fussy Bride” of Fedotov was found in his collection. After the early death of his only son Paul, Khludov donated several hundred thousand rubles and specifically bought a huge plot of land in Syromyatniki for the construction of a charity-house to care for the poor. After Khludov’s death in 1885, the Merchant Society, with the money that Khludov left them, began construction on a large home-shelter with a church, designed by architect B V Freidenberg. It was opened on May 8, 1888. At that time 50 women and 30 men were placed there, and 150 widows and orphans were placed in 87 free apartments (flats). Khludov’s daughters were also involved in building the charity Syromyatnikov; Alexandera Naydenova donated funds to build free housing apartments, Lyubov Vostryakova donated funds for free public school, and Praskovya Prokhorova donated to the ward for the weak/afflicted with illness, to a free vocational school for women, and provided yet another building for free apartments (the architect of some of the buildings was the famous Lyev Kekyshev). In Soviet times, Syromyatniki was a large industrial area near the railway station and became a slum. Modern history President of Russia Dmitri Medvedev visiting Winzavod Businessman Roman Trotsenko founded the Winzavod Center for Contemporary Art. From 2007 to March 2012 the director of the \\"Winzavod\\" was the wife of the entrepreneur, Sofia Trotsenko, Dean of the Production Department of Art Theater School. Since March 2012, the Director of Winzavod appointed Elena Panteleyeva, who worked as the chief editor of Winzavod Art Review, a free monthly newspaper published by the art center.

The album contains re-recorded versions of songs originally performed by the band during the period 1982–1986, with minor arrangement changes and updates, along with the addition of new keyboard, orchestral, choral and soundscape parts added by Kev Bower. The album was pieced together over a 3-year period principally as a 'hobby project' during occasional periods of downtime at Andy Sneap's Backstage Studios, a converted 300-year-old dairy farm in Derbyshire, England. Sneap funded the entire project out of his own pocket and has been instrumental in the band's resurrection. The recordings were completed with neither hope nor aspirations of any outcome, and the original intention was to produce just a few CDR copies for the bandmembers, close friends and family. The finished product, however, reached the attention of, and subsequently attracted bids from five record labels, with the band eventually signing to Nuclear Blast Records. The album entered the national charts in Germany and several Scandinavian countries upon its release. It received countless positive reviews and a substantial number of accolades, including '2011 Album of the Year' in Sweden Rock Magazine. It also made the No. 1 position for a 2011 UK album in 'Metal Hammer' (UK), along with featuring in the top 3 of 2011 for several European journals including 'Aardschok' (NL) and 'Rock Hard' (DE). The album also achieved the '2011 Album of the Year' on a substantial number of independent websites, rock forums and similar. The album's title is a wordplay, with obvious and immediate connotations of carcasses being turned upside down with the final lyric of 'No Martyr's Cage', the album's closing track. Several tracks featured the voice of former frontman Dave Halliday, with Andy Sneap going to great lengths to lift his voice from old cassette recordings so that he could be incorporated and his memory suitably honoured. Sneap and the rest of the bandmembers also went to similar lengths (along with substantial legal and probate costs) to ensure that the album performance and compositional royalties were split six ways instead of five, with Halliday's share going to his surviving family - this process continues to this day, with Halliday's royalties continuing to be paid for live performance and radio airplay of songs to which he contributed writing credits. The album also ended up with a running time of 66 minutes and 6 seconds, and a file download size of 666MB. This was completely accidental and unintentional. The album also runs non-stop, with track gaps between the songs being filled by a series of musical interludes, introductions and soundscapes. The album's artwork, painted by Dan Goldsworthy, also received critical acclaim. Although ostensibly dark and demonic in appearance and execution, it contains a whole series of jokes, 'tips of the hat' and various other tongue-in-cheek references to moments throughout the band's history. These include; * Former frontman Dave Halliday's face superimposed in the sky above the fallen angel on the front cover. * Dave Halliday's face similarly appears in the flames leaping from Andy Sneap's hand on his internal booklet picture. * On the internal booklet picture of bassist Tony Speakman's lunatic prison cell wall, there is an Oxo poster – a humorous nod to Speakman's appearance in a British TV commercial for this product several years earlier. * The lower rear outside cover contains a list of equipment endorsers. The Oxo logo makes a second appearance in this list. * The introduction soundscape to 'The Quest' features guitarist/keyboard player Kev Bower doing a low-level background impression of veteran British TV actor Joe Gladwin performing a voiceover from an '80's UK TV advert for Hovis bread. The band used to perform a modified version of this as a song introduction to 'Bedtime' during live performances. * The backwards Satanic voice which features under the twin-guitar break on the track 'Blasphemy and the Master' is in fact Kev Bower again, delivering a bitter missive about a former employer who sacked him. The recording was pitch- shifted and reversed, but the entire speech is printed in reverse on the lyric sheet for this song, and includes all the names of the perpetrators who collaborated to dismiss him. * The booklet centrepiece for the bonus disc in the Digipak version contains a spread of record company rejection letters amassed in the 1980s. The rejection letters were deliberately printed large enough for the authors' names to be clearly visible. Many of these individuals have subsequently gone on to hold high-ranking and influential positions in the music industry. * The 'Plague doctor' character featured within the artwork, along with rat appearing at the lower left side of the front cover, have always been known to members of the band as 'Beaky' and 'Roland' respectively, with the latter reference alluding to UK children's TV puppet character Roland Rat. * Dave Halliday received printed cover credits for 'Additional vocals, spiritual interference and dildo'. The latter refers to the fact that numerous unexplainable phenomena occurred during the making of the album, suggesting that a ghostly Mr. Halliday was in fact present throughout, along with the fact that he would regularly stuff bulk-purchased dildos into the cleavages of front-row female fans during live performances. Several versions were issued; – * Standard single CD jewel case * 2 CD Digipak version including a bonus disc of the band's original '80's cassette demos and rehearsal room recordings. A minor cutting inaccuracy during production of the outer slipcase for this Digipak made it notoriously difficult to remove the discs from the packaging.

Only 300 units were produced in each colour. * Triple 180g vinyl exclusive for 'High Roller Records' (DE) in black vinyl – again only 300 units were produced. * Licensed single CD versions for Russia and Japan * Prior to release, a limited 7\\" vinyl single picture disc was issued, containing edited versions of 'On Earth As It Is in Hell', and 'Save Us From Those Who Would Save Us'. * A video for 'On Earth As It Is in Hell' was also produced, and has clocked up in excess of 500,000 hits on YouTube.

A popular tourist attraction, it is meant to describe and depict Naraka (Buddhist hell). Geography The hell garden is located at Sai 2, Soi 19, Saen Suk, close to Thailand's Bang Saen Beach. Near the garden is a Thai hotel resort. Features The Wang Saen Suk Hell Garden is the largest hell garden in Thailand. At the entrance of the monastery garden, a brightly colored sign reads \\"Welcome To Hell\\" Further inside the garden, another sign reads: At the start of the garden trial sits a giant \\"fat Buddha\\" statue. Numerous cement-and-plaster statues depicting life in a Buddhist hell can be found throughout the garden. After a series of relatively peaceful, spiritual scenes, the visitor turns a corner to see a diorama depicting Buddhist hell. Two large figures named 'Nai Ngean' and 'Nang Thong' stand high above the tortured souls of the garden; their emaciated appearance, long necks and distended bellies seems to mark them as Preta, the 'hungry ghosts' of Thai folklore. Around the feet of these figures are arranged 21 tortured souls, each with the head of a different animal. These animalistic characterisations reflect the nature of each soul's sin; plaques at the feet of each feature inscriptions such as: Other designations include the ungrateful becoming tigers, jealous people being named rabbits and bird heads given to those who steal cooked rice. After this first area come illustrations of the specific punishments for a list of very particular crimes. These include depictions of human sinners being ripped apart by the dogs of Hell, burnt alive in boiling cauldrons, disembowelled by birds, and having their heads replaced with those of animals. Donation boxes located next to each scene encourage penance through charity. They also detail the sins likely to incur the depicted torture; these range from a woman being crushed in a vice for committing aborticide and a man having his head savagely knocked off for undermining Buddhism.

In a lengthy article, Christian Schmidt «L'entrée dans une phase descendante de l'économie mondiale» devrait accroître «l'incertitude» politique » Le Monde, Mardi 21 Mars 2017 stated on Korotayev, Grinin and Tausch's work on Kondratieff cycles: \\"First, according to our three authors: the upward economic phase that began in the mid-1980s ended; it is in the process of making way for a downward phase which should begin to manifest its effects from the years 2015-2018, that is to say as soon as the exit of our great crisis of 2008 begins. This is to explain part of the unexpected character of our uncertainty. Concerning the relationship between this last phase of economic growth and armed conflicts, it seems to confirm Kondratieff's hypothesis. The entry into a downward phase of the world economy should aggravate this trend while increasing the uncertainty of its forms. [...] This panorama is certainly not enough to reduce these unexpected uncertainties, but it already contributes to better understand them by identifying several of their origins.\\".

It was written by Robin Zander, Tom Petersson, Rick Nielsen, Bun E. Carlos and Julian Raymond, and produced by Cheap Trick, with co-production by Raymond. \\"If It Takes a Lifetime\\" was released as a remixed promotional single, aimed at generating radio play. The song's remix, named the \\"Little Steven Van Zandt Radio Edit\\", was created by the American musician and producer Steven Van Zandt of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. In his weekly Billboard column, Little Steven's Underground Garage, Zandt listed the song as No. 2 of his Top 10 \\"Coolest Garage Songs\\". In a 2006 interview with Star Press, Nielsen told Michelle Kinsey that \\"If It Takes a Lifetime\\" was the song he looked forward to playing most during a Cheap Trick concert. Promotion On June 7, 2006, the band appeared on Rockline, a nationally syndicated radio interview program hosted by Bob Coburn, and performed the song live. The band also performed the song on the Bart Connor-presented WGN America show MDA on September 4, 2006, and a MSNBC show on September 25.

K. L. Poore of Audio Video Revolution noted: \\"...while listening to \\"If It Takes a Lifetime\\" I figure that Rick Nielsen went to his \\"catchy hook\\" trunk, pulled out 10 or 15 and crammed them into the same song.\\" Ben Perry of 80's Metal Server said of the song: \\"For me, this is the easiest song on the album to get stuck in my head. No idea why, but it does... on a frequent basis and I do not even listen to this album much.\\" Andrew J. McNeice of MelodicRock.com considered the song to be \\"very Lap of Luxury-ish pop/rock\\". Tony Bonyata of ConcertLivewire.com described the song as a \\"sugar-buzzed power-pop anthem\\". In a review of the 2008 compilation The Coolest Songs in the World, Vol. 5, Mark Deming of AllMusic said: \\"Van Zandt clearly knows a great single when he hears one, and \\"Pull Shapes,\\" \\"Porno Movies,\\" and \\"If It Takes a Lifetime\\" all get over on cool melodies, high spirits, and ineffable cool that defies generic classification.\\" Jed Gottlieb of The Phoenix wrote: \\"The first three tracks are irrelevant stabs at anemic Top 40.

The election was won by incumbent governor MR Sukhumbhand Paribatra of the Democrat Party. Twenty-five candidates contested the election. Pol Gen Pongsapat Pongcharoen, representing the Pheu Thai Party, was regarded as the other major contender. The election was scheduled to take place sixty days after Sukhumbhand resigned on 9 January 2013, his second-to-last day of office. (Resignation, as opposed to completion of the term, effectively extended the election deadline for another fifteen days.) The Election Commission accepted registrations on 21–25 January, although unofficial campaigning had begun earlier. The election was viewed as a sharp contest between the Democrat Party, whose candidates had held the governorship since 2004, and the Pheu Thai Party, which lead the current national government. While Bangkok is regarded as a traditional stronghold of the Democrat Party, Sukhumbhand faced low public approval ratings. Prior to endorsing Sukhumbhand, the party faced internal controversy over the candidacy. Sukhumbhand's first- term performance was generally viewed as poor, a fact some have attributed to partisan conflicts between the city and national governments. The Pheu Thai Party picked up on this dissatisfaction and campaigned on \\"seamless coordination\\" between the governments. Its candidate Pongsapat previously served as spokesman of the Royal Thai Police. The highlight of the election was also other candidates who ran independently, including: * Police General Seripisut Temiyavet, former Commissioner-General of the Royal Thai Police and anti-corruption activist; * Suharit Siamwala, DJ and business executive; * Kosit Suvinitjit, former CEO of Media of Medias Co. and Spring News channel; * Thoranee Rittheethamrong, an exorcist who revealed that she applied for candidacy \\"because of the Heaven's mandate\\" by which she has been directed to \\"liberate Bangkok from the authority of the Ministry of Interior and transfer this authority to its citizens\\"; * Jongjit Hirunlabh, environmentalist; * Captain Metta Temchamnan, war veteran; * Wila Udom, Chatuchak Market representative. Sukhumbhand won the election with 1,256,349 votes, or 47.75% percent of votes cast. Pongsapat won 1,077,899 votes (40.97%). Voter turnout was 63.98 percent.

Lippmann\\" and \\"FK Lippmann\\"; 27 October 1883, in Offenbach am Main - 30 May 1957) was a German painter of the New Objectivity, known for landscapes and portraits.  Life  The Deutschordenhaus at the time when Lippmann had his studio there Karl Friedrich Lippmann was of the three children of the painter, lithographer and print shop owner Johann Lippmann (1858 *, † 1933) and his wife, Frieda Schoembs. He studied at the Technical School (today Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach) 1900-02 and then at the School of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Berlin (the school merged later with Berlin University of the Arts). After his military service he continued his studies for three years at the private academy of Anton Ažbe in Munich, then he spend a year the Städelschule in Frankfurt (1906–07) and a year in the private school of Professor Julius Exter in Munich. There he fell in love with Martina Ruch, whom he later married, they had four children, of which his daughter also studied art In Offenbach, he lived at Buchrainweg, No. 161. His large studio was located in the Deutschherrenhaus in Frankfurt on the river Main. After the destruction of his studio during WWII he moved to Eichstätt in Bavaria to save the life of his children. Eichstätt was the home town of his second wife, Berta Bahrer. His studio was located in the Crown Tower near the Cathedral square. To come back to Offenbach, the art patron Dr. Jean Rill gave him an apartment in the Tulpenhofstr. in Westend. Two years after his return he died unexpectedly. He was buried in the Old Cemetery in Offenbach next to his father. His second wife was still alive until 1980 and is also buried there. Honors  In 1959, a street in Darmstadt was named Lippmann-Strasse in honor of Karl Friedrich Lippmann and his father  Work  Lippmann created landscapes and portraits. His work was shown 1923 alongside Kandinsky, Kokoschka, Klee, Liebermann and Käthe Kollwitz at the Darmstadt Secessionhttp://www.offenbach.de/offenbach/themen/unterwegs-in- offenbach/stadtinfo/stadtgeschichte/jahrestage/news/lippmann.html \\"1957: Ein Meister der Portraitmalerei stirbt\\" auf www.offenbach.de one of the most important contemporary exhibition of Expressionism. Inspired by numerous trips to France and Italy, but also to the North Sea and the Alps, he turned from to expressionistic landscape and flower paintings. In the Weimar Republic he was a recognized and famous painter. The gallery owner and art dealer Ludwig Schames sold one work of Lippmann to the art collectors Ludwig und Rosy Fischer.Georg Heuberger, Ljuba Berankova: Expressionismus und Exil: die Sammlung Ludwig und Rosy Fischer, S. 178.

Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) acting similarly to an estrogen on the vaginal epithelium, building vaginal wall thickness which in turn reduces the pain associated with dyspareunia. Dyspareunia is most commonly caused by \\"vulvar and vaginal atrophy.\\" The medication was approved by the FDA in February 2013 and by the European Commission for marketing in the EU in January 2015. Medical uses Ospemifene is used to treat dyspareunia. In the US it is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause. In the EU it is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic VVA in post-menopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal oestrogen therapy. It is available as a 60 mg tablet that is taken by mouth once a day. The fact that ospemifene can be taken orally is advertised as an advantage over other products that are topically applied in the vaginal canal. Ospemifene has not demonstrated any effects on libido, arousal, duration of intercourse or quality of orgasm in controlled clinical trials. Contraindications Women with \\"undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia; active or history of deep vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; arterial thromboembolic disease; and are or may become pregnant\\" or \\"with known or suspected breast cancer or those with extreme hepatic impairment\\" should not take ospemifene. This is not a full list of contraindications. Side effects Side effects associated with ospemifene include vaginal discharge, hot flashes, and diaphoresis. More serious adverse effects are similar to those of estrogens and estrogen receptor modulators. These include, but are not limited to, thromboembolism, allergic reactions, fatigue, and headache, and others could occur. There are other additional adverse effects. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. As such, many of the effects produced by estrogens are produced by ospemifene. The boxed warning of the medication indicates ospemifene may thicken the endometrium, which could lead to unusual bleeding and endometrial cancer. For women taking estrogens, concurrently taking a type of drug called a progestin has been shown to decrease the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia. In theory, progestins may be expected to attenuate ospemifene's effects on endometrial thickening. However clinical trials confirming this have not been conducted. Like estrogens, ospemifene also may increase the risk for cardiovascular events, including \\"stroke, coronary heart disease, venous thromboembolism,\\" and others. The risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes is given as 0.72 and 1.45 per 1,000 women, while that of deep vein thrombosis is estimated to be 1.45 per 1,000 women. The risks of these adverse events in women taking ospemifene are lower than those in women taking estrogen alone in the form of oral conjugated estrogens. Studies have not documented the relative risk compared with women taking estrogen/progestin therapy. Pharmacology=Pharmacodynamics= Ospemifene is \\"an estrogen agonist/antagonist that makes vaginal tissue thicker and less fragile resulting in a reduction in the amount of pain women experience with sexual intercourse.\\" This medication should be used for the shortest amount of time possible due to associated adverse effects. History=Approval process= Hormos Medical Ltd., which is a part of QuatRx Pharmaceuticals, filed a patent on January 19, 2005 for a solid dosage form of ospemifene. In March 2010, QuatRX Pharmaceuticals licensed ospemifene to Shionogi & Co., Ltd. for clinical development and marketing. A New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the FDA on April 26, 2012. Amendments to the NDA were submitted in June, July, August, October, and November 2012, and January and February 2013. It was ultimately approved by the FDA on February 26, 2013. Ospemifene (under the brand name Senshio) was subsequently approved by the European Commission for marketing in the EU in January 2015. =Preclinial and clinical trials= Preclinical trials were performed in ovariectomized rats to model menopause. Oral ospemifene was compared with raloxifene (another SERM), its metabolites 4-hydroxy ospemifene and 4'-hydroxy ospemifene, estradiol, and ospemifene administered as an intravaginal suppository. Estradiol was used as a positive control and raloxifene was used because it is in the same drug class as ospemifene. Multiple doses of oral ospemifene were tested. 10 mg/kg/day of Ospemifene was found to cause a greater increase in vaginal weight and vaginal epithelial height than 10 mg/kg/day of raloxifene. Vaginal weight had a 1.46x increase after a two-week treatment of 10 mg/kg/day of ospemifene. The number of progesterone receptors was increased in the vaginal stroma and epithelium, which indicates that ospemifene has \\"estrogenic activity.\\" A binding assay was also performed to measure the affinity of ospemifene for the estrogen receptor (ERα and ERβ). The study showed that ospemifene bound ERα and ERβ with similar affinity. Ospemifene bound the estrogen receptors with a lower affinity than estradiol. Ospemifene was shown to be an antagonist of \\"ERE-mediated transactivation on MCF-7 cells,\\" which the authors concluded indicates \\"anti- estrogenic activity in breast cancer cells.\\" Two 12-week phase 3 clinical trials were performed for ospemifene. One evaluated the effects of Ospemifene on vaginal tissue thickness, composition and vaginal pH. The other evaluated the effects of Ospemifene on vaginal tissue and on symptoms of dyspareunia. Between the two trials, 4 signs and symptoms were measured. These included three tissue-related signs, two of which represented histological changes in the vaginal tissue (change in percent parabasal cells and change in percent superficial cells) and the third was \\"change in vaginal pH\\". Dyspareunia was evaluated in one of the trials. It was defined as \\"change in most bothersome symptom\\" of discomfort during sexual activity and further limited to symptoms of either vaginal dryness or vaginal pain.\\" Ospemifene produced more changes in vaginal tissue and greater reduction in dyspareunia symptoms than placebo. A dose-response also was observed in the trial; ospemifene 60 mg had greater efficacy than ospemifene 30 mg. Safety was also evaluated in these phase 3 trials. There was a 5.2% increase in the incidence of hot flushes, 1.6% increase in urinary tract infections, and 0.5% increase in the incidence of headache with ospemifene over placebo. One of the phase 3 trials was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 826 post-menopausal women. The trial patients were required to have one or more symptom of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) that was moderate or severe in nature with fewer than 5% of cells that were superficial when examined by a vaginal smear and a vaginal pH of at least 5.0. This trial did not quantify relief of dyspareunia as a study outcome measure. The other phase 3 trial was conducted in 605 women aged 40 to 80, who were diagnosed with VVA, and whose worst symptom was dyspareunia.

Two members are a part of this tribe, the extant Nothomyrmecia and the extinct Prionomyrmex. The tribe was once considered a subfamily due to the similarities between Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex, but such reclassification was not widely accepted by the scientific community. These ants can be identified by their long slender bodies, powerful stingers and elongated mandibles. Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants were once found throughout Europe, possibly nesting in trees and preferring jungle habitats. Today, Prionomyrmecini is only found in Australia, preferring old-growth mallee woodland surrounded by Eucalyptus trees. Nothomyrmecia workers feed on nectar and arthropods, using their compound eyes for prey and navigational purposes. Owing to their primitive nature, they do not recruit others to food sources or create pheromone trails. Nothomyrmecia colonies are small, consisting of 50 to 100 individuals. Taxonomy Prionomyrmecini was originally described in 1915 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler in his journal article \\"The ants of the Baltic amber\\", who originally placed it in the subfamily Ponerinae. In the same journal, Wheeler assigned Prionomyrmex as the sole member of the tribe. In 1954, William Brown Jr. moved the tribe to Myrmeciinae, noting similar morphological characteristics of Prionomyrmex and other genera such as Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia. In 2000, Cesare Baroni Urbani described a new fossil species from Baltic amber, which he named Prionomyrmex janzeni. After examining specimens of his newly described species and Nothomyrmecia, Baroni Urbani noted that Prionomyrmex is a paraphyletic relative to Nothomyrmecia, and the two genera were so morphologically similar that Nothomyrmecia must be synonymised. Due to this, Baroni Urbani separated Prionomyrmex from Myrmeciinae and synonymised Nothomyrmecia, renaming Nothomyrmecia macrops as Prionomyrmex macrops. The tribe itself was later treated as a subfamily, known as Prionomyrmeciinae. In 2003, Dlussky & Perfilieva separated Nothomyrmecia from Prionomyrmex and both genera were moved to the subfamily Myrmeciinae, and Prionomyrmecini was treated as a tribe. In 2005 and 2008, Baroni Urbani provided additional evidence in favour of his proposed classification, but such proposal has been rejected by the entomological community. Nothomyrmecia macrops and the extinct Prionomyrmex are the only accepted members of the tribe. Description and distribution Prionomyrmex longiceps from Europe Members of Prionomyrmecini can be distinguished from other members by the reduced or lacking ocelli, and a lateral clypeal carina is present. Prionomyrmex ants are characterised by their large size, slender bodies, elongated mandibles and powerful stingers. Lengths vary from . Overall, the body structure of Prionomyrmex shows that it is more primitive than Myrmecia. Nothomyrmecia is smaller than Prionomyrmex species, measuring . The ant has a long stinger, the body is slender and, like Prionomyrmex, has elongated mandibles. The mandibles, however, are less specialised than Myrmecia and Prionomyrmex, elongated and triangular. While Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex are strikingly similar to each other, they can be distinguished from the shape of the node. Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants existed in Europe during the Eocene and Late Oligocene. Cesare Baroni Urbani collected Prionomyrmex janzeni in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad, Russia and Prionomyrmex wappleri in Germany. Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr collected Prionomyrmex longiceps in Baltic amber from the Eocene, but the exact location of its discovery is unclear, due to the lost type material. P. longiceps were an arboreal nesting species, living in trees instead of the ground. William Morton Wheeler assumed this due to its long legs, sharp claws and elongated mandibles. Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations. Nothomyrmecia is only found in Australia. Until its rediscovery, the genus was only known from the original specimens collected in Western Australia by Amy Crocker in December 1931. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor expressed doubt about the type locality of the ant, but said that the specimens were probably collected from the western end of the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. Entomologists feared that Nothomyrmecia was extinct, as notable biologists such as E.O. Wilson made attempts to find the ant but failed to do so. In 1977, Taylor rediscovered Nothomyrmecia in Poochera, 1300 km (800 mi) away from the original collection site. Colonies are found in old growth mallee woodland with many Eucalyptus species such as Eucalyptus brachycalyx, Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus gracilis abundant. Only a few small colonies are known in its restricted distribution, listing it as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Behaviour and ecology Nothomyrmecia queens with stubby wings, as well as pupae and a worker (left) Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex share similar behaviours with other Myrmeciinae relatives. Prionomyrmex may have foraged on the ground or onto trees and low vegetation, feeding on nectar and arthropods. Nothomyrmecia workers, however, drink hemolymph from the insects they capture, and the larvae are carnivorous. It is not known if the ants were active during the day or night, but Nothomyrmecia is a nocturnal ground forager that prefers very cold nights. Both ants have large compound eyes, relying on their vision for prey and navigational purposes. Due to their primitive and simplified social life, workers of both genera do not recruit others to food sources or leave down trail pheromones, suggesting that both these ants are solitary foragers. Prionomyrmex ants were hosts to female stylopid parasites. Predators are unknown for both ants. Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous, meaning that they have stubby rudimentary wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with population structure, possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates may begin to emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony- founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When a colony is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies, taken over by one of her daughters. This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal.

The ability to distinguish the uplift or demand due to the impact of the trade promotion as opposed to baseline demand is fundamental to model promotion behavior. Model determination enables what-if analysis to evaluate different campaign scenarios with the goal of improving promotion effectiveness and ROI at the product-channel level by selecting the best scenario. Trade promotion forecasting challenges Trade Promotion spending is one of the consumer goods industry’s largest expenses with costs for major manufacturers ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent of gross sales. Understandably, 67 percent of respondents to a recent survey said they were concerned about the return on investment (ROI) gained from such spending. Quantifying ROI depends heavily on the ability to accurately identify the “baseline” demand (the demand that would exist without the impact of the trade promotion) and the uplift.“Trade Promotion Management: The Haves and Have-Nots,” Consumer Goods Technology, September 2012. In fact, forecast accuracy plays a critical role in the success of consumer goods companies. Aberdeen Group research found that best- in-class forecasting companies (with an average forecast accuracy of 72 percent) have an average promotion gross margin uplift of 28 percent, while laggard forecasting companies (with an average forecasting accuracy of only 42 percent) have a gross margin uplift of less than 7 percent.“Sanhir Anand and Nari Viswanathan, “Plan, Spend and Prosper: Making the Most of Trade Promotion,” AberdeenGroup Research Report, September, 2007. A bottom-up sales forecast at the SKU-account/POS level requires taking into account product attributes, historical sales levels and store specifics. The large number of different variables which describe the product, the store and the promotion attributes, both quantitative and qualitative, could potentially have many different values. Selecting the most important variables and incorporating them into a prediction model is a challenging task.Michael Trusov, Anand V. Bodapati, Lee G. Cooper, “Retailer Promotion Planning: Improving Forecast Accuracy and Interpretability,” Journal of Interactive Marketing, Summer/Autumn 2006. Despite these challenges, two-thirds of companies in the consumer supply chain consider forecast accuracy a high business priority. 74 percent said it would be helpful to develop a bottom-up forecast based on stock-keeping unit (SkU) by key customer.“Half of consumer goods firms still using Excel for forecasting, need better tools,” TechJournal, August 3, 2012. Traditional trade promotion forecasting methods Many companies forecast the impact of trade promotions primarily through a human expert approach. Human experts are unable to take into account all the variables involved and also cannot provide an analytic prediction of campaign behavior and trends. A recent survey by Aberdeen Group showed that 78 percent of companies used Microsoft Excel spreadsheets as their primary trade promotion forecasting technology tool. The limitations of spreadsheets for trade promotion planning and forecasting include lack of visibility, ineffectiveness and difficulty in tracking deductions.Kevin Perment, “Trade Promotion Management: An Excess of Excel! ,” AberdeenGroup blog, August 21, 2012. Specialized trade promotion forecasting applications have been developed and are becoming more common. 35 percent of companies now use legacy systems, 30 percent use Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP;) applications, 26 percent use integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) modules and 17percent use home grown trade promotion solutions. These applications support the planning process, while still primarily relying on human knowledge and intuition for forecasting. One problem with this approach is that humans tend to make optimistic assumptions when forecasting and planning. The result is that forecasts most commonly err on the optimistic side and that human forecasters also tend to underestimate the amount of uncertainty in their forecasts.Ann Grackin, “Shaking up the Status Quo in Demand Management ,” The Brief, October 9, 2012. A further issue is that legacy trade promotion systems contribute to internal fragmentation of trade marketing data. Many companies using these tools are currently producing assumption-based forecasts with limited accuracy.Nari Viswanathan, “Responsive Trade Promotion Management: Creating a Single Version of the Truth,” Supply Chain Brain, February 18, 2009. Analytic approaches to trade promotion forecasting TPF is complicated by the fact that campaigns are described by both quantitative (such as price and discount) and qualitative (such as display space and support by sales representatives) variables. New approaches are being developed to address this and other challenges. Most of these approaches attempt to incorporate large amounts of heterogeneous data in the forecasting process. One researcher validated the ability of multivariate regression models to forecast the impact on sales of a product of many variables including price, discount, visual merchandizing, etc.Balasubramanian Kanagasabapathi, K. Antony Arokia Durai Raj, B. Shoban Babu, Mitul Shah, “Forecasting volumes for trade promotions in CPG industry using market drivers,” International Journal of Business Forecasting and Marketing Intelligence, 2009 Vol.1, No.2, pp.139 – 152. The term Big Data describes the increasing volume and velocity of heterogeneous data that is coming into the enterprise. The data can be used to improve trade promotion forecast accuracy because it usually contains real connections and causation that can help to better understand what customers are buying, where they are buying it, why they are buying and how they are buying. Often, the challenge is to combine this data across all of the silos within the organization for a single view.John Bruno, Radhika Subramanian, “The Big Value in Big Data: Seeing Customer Buying Patterns,” Forbes.com, September 25, 2012. Traditional methods are insufficient to assimilate and process such a large volume of data. Therefore more sophisticated modeling and algorithms have been developed to address the problem. Some companies have begun using machine learning methods to utilize the massive volumes of unstructured and structured data they already hold to better understand these connections and causality.G. Di Pillo, V. Latorre, S. Lucidi, E. Procacci, “An application of learning machines to sales forecasting under promotions,” ACTOR University of Rome, April 8, 2011. Machine learning can make it possible to recognize the shared characteristics of promotional events and identify their effect on normal sales. Learning machines use simpler versions of nonlinear functions to model complex nonlinear phenomena. Learning machines process sets of input and output data and develop a model of their relationship. Based on this model, learning machines forecast outputs associated with new sets of input data. Intelligible Machine Learning (IML) is an implementation of Switching Neural Networks that has been applied to TPF. Starting from a collection of promotional characteristics, IML is able to identify and present in intelligible form existing correlations between relevant attributes and uplift. This approach is designed to automatically select the most suitable uplift model in order to describe the future impact of a planned promotion. In addition, new promotions are automatically classified using the previously trained model, thus providing a simple way of studying different what-if scenarios.E. Ferrari, M. Muselli, “Efficient constructive techniques for training Switching Neural Networks,” Constructive Neural Networks, Studies in Computational Intelligence, Vol. 258, Pages 25–48. TPF systems should be capable of correlating and analyzing vast amounts of raw data in different formats such as corporate sales histories and online data from social media. The analysis should be able to be performed very quickly so planners can respond quickly to demand signals.Yevgeny Abramovich, Forecasting promotions, “You don’t have to use a feather to crack a coconut,” MyCustomer.com, December 13, 2012. Groupe Danone used machine learning technology for trade promotion forecasting of a range of fresh products characterized by dynamic demand and short shelf life.

History Bark bread seems to be a primarily Scandinavian tradition. Mention of it is found in medieval literature and may have an even older tradition among the Sami people. During the 18th and early 19th century Northern Europe experienced several very bad years of crop failure, particularly during the Little Ice Age of the mid-18th century. The grain harvest was badly affected, and creative solutions to make the flour last longer were introduced. In 1742, samples of \\"emergency bread\\" were sent from Kristiansand, Norway, to the Royal Administration in Copenhagen, among them bark bread, bread made from grainless husks and bread made from burned bones. During the Napoleonic Wars, moss too was used for human consumption. The last time bark bread was used as famine food in Norway was during the Napoleonic Wars. The introduction of the potato as a staple crop gave the farmers alternative crops when grain production failed, so that bark bread and moss cakes were no longer needed. In Northern Sweden, traces of Sami harvest of bark from Scots pine are known from the 1890s, and in Finland pettuleipä (literally \\"pinewood-bark bread\\") was eaten in Finland as an emergency food when there has been a shortage of food, especially during the Great Famine of the 1690s, during the second famine the 1860s and most recently during the 1918 Civil War. Examples of production Finger sized twigs and branches were collected from deciduous trees and shrubs, and the bark split and the inner bark (the phloem and sometimes the vascular cambium) collected while still fresh. The yellow or green inner bark (depending on tree species) was dried over open fire, in an oven or dried in the sun for a few days. A mortar or mill was used to grind the bark to a fine powder to add to the flour. The dried bark pieces could also be added directly to the grain during milling. The bread was then baked the normal way adding yeast and salt. Bark bread did not leaven as quickly as normal bread due to bark content. The more bark to flour, the slower the leavening. Bark bread was therefore often made as a flatbread. The bark flour could also be used for porridge.\\"Uppteckningar gällande Nödåren\\" , (in Swedish) told by Augusta Karlsson, born 1856 Bark bread as food The bark component was usually from deciduous trees like elm, ash, aspen, rowan or birch, but scots pine and Iceland moss (sometimes named \\"bread moss\\" in Norwegian) are mentioned in historic sources. The inner bark is the only part of a tree trunk that is actually edible, the remaining bark and wood is made up of cellulose which animals, including humans, cannot digest. The dried and ground inner bark was added in proportions like 1/4th to 1/3rd \\"bark flour\\" to the remaining grain flour. Erik Pontoppidan, the Bishop of Bergen, Norway, in the mid 18th century, recommended using elm, as it helped the often crumbly bark bread hold together better.Pontoppidan, E. (1752/1753): Forsøk til Norges naturlige historie (Attempt at the Natural History of Norway). Vol I and II. The bark will, however, add a rather bitter taste to the bread, and give particularly white bread an unappetizing grey-green hue. Another problem is that the yeast cannot break down the ground bark and the bread will not leaven properly and be hard and not hold together well. Though bark today is sometimes added to pastry as a culinary curiosity, bark bread was considered an emergency food, and as is common with such food, phased out as soon as the availability of grain improved. The bark bread was seen as nutritionally deficient, more as \\"stomach filler\\" than as actual sustenance. Both the bishop Pontoppidan and others blamed the high mortality during the famine of the 1740s on the \\"unhealthy bark bread\\" and general lack of food. Among the Sami however, the bark and bark bread made from Scots pine served as an important source of vitamin C.

Jamie Fleeman or Fleeming (1713–1778) was better known as \\"the Laird of Udny's Fool\\" or \\"the Laird of Udny's Fule\\" in the Scots language. Although described as a fool, he had a reputation for his clever, witty repartee and many anecdotal tales of his actions are re-capped. He was specifically mentioned in the 1845 Statistical Accounts of Scotland and characterised in novels. Fleeman is associated with the Countess of Erroll and was used by her to carry messages to Jacobite rebels. He was probably the last family jester in Scotland. Early life Fleeman was born in Longside, Aberdeenshire, in 1713 and was one of three children. His precise date of birth is not given but he is recorded as being baptised on 7 April 1713. Few details are known about his father except he was a crofter who was also named James Fleming. There is also scant information about his mother other than that she drowned in a deep pool beside the Bridge of Ludquharn. The pool became known as \\"Fleeman's Pot\\". Fleeman's sister, Martha, was a Presbyterian and often conversed by quoting Psalms and had the reputation of being demented. Fleeman's brother is believed to have died aboard HMS Serapis. Fleeman is described as having a large round head with dull hair that stood on end giving the impression he had been \\"scared out of his wits\\", broad shouldered and possessing formidable strength. He often went barefoot and wore basic clothing of sack-cloth or serge material. The home of Sir Alexander Guthrie near Ludquharn was where Fleeman spent his childhood days but he was already being favoured by other local gentry for his ready wit and amusing remarks. Most of his life was then predominantly spent as a part of the Laird of Udny's household although Fleeman still roamed wherever he chose. Career Fleeman was employed by the Laird of Udny and was dependent on him. His primary function was to provide amusement to the family but he also worked as a farm labourer tending cows and geese. Although Fleeman has been described as a fool or a family jester, he was listed as a pauper in the statistical accounts. He is specifically mentioned by Reverend John Imray of Longside Parish under Section II, eminent characters of the New Statistical Account of Scotland 1845, where it states: In 1734 Fleeman was with the Laird of Udny and his family at Knockhall Castle. The castle was destroyed by fire and Fleeman is credited with saving the lives of the family. He was said to have been woken by a dog who was his companion and after discovering the fire, first woke his friends before throwing a large oak chest through a window; normally the weight of the chest meant it needed three men to lift it. Initially Fleeman did not attempt to rouse anyone he disliked, including a bad-tempered domestic servant who he felt generally treated him badly. It was only after he was begged by other staff that he went back into the castle and woke the woman. The family returned to living at Udny Castle after the fire. Fleeman is described as a \\"protector and confidante\\" of the Countess of Erroll who was a fervent Jacobite supporter. He was able to move around the area without being questioned or suspected of any illicit activity and she used him to deliver messages when she was mustering support for the Jacobite rebellion. She also used him to convey messages to Lord Pitsligo when he was in hiding at Auchiries. His notoriety extended to Fleeman's name being included in one of Bram Stoker's Dracula stories. In the 1914 collection of works entitled Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories, first published after Stoker's death, in the tale called \\"Crooken Sands\\", Mr Markham has asked his companion if he saw someone else dressed in the same manner as his own. The reply given was that there had not been any such fool since the time of Jamie Fleeman, the Laird of Udny's Fool. The fictional character of Davie Gellatley who appears in the 1814 novel Waverley by Sir Walter Scott is thought to be based on Fleeman. Gellatley is characterised as an 'innocent' and a 'fool'. Some of Fleeman's remarks and actions were also recapped in a newspaper article in a significant weekly publication in New Zealand in 1889. Fleeman is attributed as the last of the \\"family jesters in Scotland\\" and is better known than the laird who employed him. Anecdotes Several of Fleeman's anecdotes are published. One frequently quoted is the tale of Fleeman approaching a minister with a horse shoe he had found on the road. He asked the minister what it was and received the reply \\"Why Jamie, any fool would know that it is a horse shoe\\"; Fleeman's response was \\"Ah, what it is to be wise – to ken it's no a meer's shoe.\\" On another occasion a rather droll but superior gent condescendingly asked Fleeman \\"Whose fool are you?\\" and Fleeman answered \\"I'm Udny's feel. Wha's feel are ye?\\" Jamie Fleeman's grave, Longside Death During a summer evening of 1778, Fleeman became soaked in a heavy rain storm. He quickly developed a fever, which then turned to jaundice. He received no offers of help and spent time wandering between different houses but no one was willing to give him shelter. Fleeman's weakened state caused him to rapidly become emaciated and lose his strength. He eventually found shelter in a barn at Little Ardiffery, in the parish of Cruden. He secured the barn door with a piece of planking and fell asleep. A short while later, some farm labourers, unaware Fleeman was sleeping behind the door, forced it open causing the plank to strike Fleeman's head. The severity of his injury was not discovered until some hours later; he was then taken to the kitchen and his wound attended to. Fleeman insisted he wanted to return to Longside, some eight miles distant. He took a whole day to walk back to his sister's cottage in Kinmundy. Two days later, Fleeman died. Two versions of his last words are given; they were either: \\"I'm of a gentle persuasion, dinna bury me like a beast\\" or \\"I'm a Christian, dinna bury me like a beast.\\" Fleeman's grave is at Longside and a monument to mark his grave was erected in 1861.

Since the earliest days of European settlement at the Cape, the indigenous forests of the southern Cape were used as a seemingly inexhaustible source of timber and fuel. From 1652 when Jan van Riebeeck landed at the Cape until the 1880s, the forests and the fauna they supported were despoiled in the same way as those of the United States and Australia, with little or no thought given to sustainability. About 1776 a woodcutting centre was established at George, a step which heralded a century of plundering of the surrounding forests. An improved road between Swellendam and George saw an ever-increasing number of settlers and adventurers eager to participate in the timber boom. The perception was that of an unlimited resource, leading to excessively wasteful practices where only the choicest grades and sizes of timber were removed, and the majority of cut trees were simply left to rot. In 1778, the Governor Joachim van Plettenberg inspected the region and was appalled at the destruction. As a result, Johann Fredrick Meeding was appointed Resident at Plettenberg Bay in an effort to instil some form of control over the cutting. Meeding diligently performed his duties and his post survived a number of successive changes of government which followed British occupation of the Cape in 1795. Even so, no new conservation measures were introduced, and when Graaff-Reinet was founded in 1786 the timber boom resumed with wholesale cutting of the forests between George and Knysna, the official founding of George in 1811 aggravating the destruction. A further burden on the forests was the Royal Navy's extraction of timber to meet the needs of the dockyard at Simonstown, a situation which lasted until 1825 when iron saw an increasing use in boat-building. The withdrawal of the Navy's workers led to an immediate occupation of the vacated areas by new woodcutters. The start of the Great Trek in 1836 caused new waves of cutters from the Langkloof to invade the forests of the Tsitsikamma in the Humansdorp area. To make matters worse the Government decided in 1846 to sell the worked- out forests as agricultural lots. Of the remaining forest only a narrow strip stretching between the Keurbooms and Kaaimans Rivers were under State control and the local magistrate issued felling permits to woodcutters in an attempt to gather as much revenue as possible. By 1847 the situation had become so critical that all Crown Forests were declared closed. A Conservator of Forests was appointed assisted by 4 rangers. This protection was short-lived and in 1856 the forests were re-opened. The second Conservator of Forests was appointed at this time and was a retired Army officer, Captain Christopher Harison, a man with no forestry training, but with remarkable aptitude for his new career. He made himself familiar with European silviculture and adopted the practice of exploiting the forests in sections which led to better control and greatly reduced waste. He was also an outspoken critic of Crown Forest alienation and it was largely due to his efforts that this practice was stopped. The Colonial Botanist, Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe, issued dire warnings about the extent of destruction and became another voice supporting the growing conservation mood. The appointment of Captain Baron de Fin as Conservator of Forests at Keiskammahoek followed in 1865. Despite the warnings, matters carried on in much the same way until the great forest fire of February 1869 in which large parts of the forest between George and the Bloukrans River were completely destroyed. The matter was raised in Parliament and a commission consisting of Captain Harison and Thomas Bain was appointed. Following this Captain Harison was appointed as Conservator of Forests for the Knysna region in 1874. His work was bedevilled by the timber needs of the railway line to Kimberley and the short-lived gold rush at Millwood in 1876. De Vasselot's appointment as Superintendent of Woods and Forests followed in 1880. This was the first time that a professional forester had been put in charge and was a turning point in South African forestry. For the first time the authorities were persuaded that a sound silvicultural policy was of greater importance than the revenue derived from exploitation. The details of the new management system were spelled out in the Forest Regulation of 1883. When de Vasselot left the Cape in 1891, the forests of George, Knysna and the Tsitsikamma were being managed on a scientific basis.Our Green Heritage – The South African Book of Trees – Immelman, Wicht & Ackerman (Tafelberg, Cape Town 1973) Two important publications by de Vasselot in 1885 were an \\"Introduction to the Systematic Treatment of the Crown Forests of the Cape Colony\\" and a pamphlet on \\"Selection and Seasoning of Wood\\", both translated into English by the then Conservator of Transkeian Forests, A. W. Heywood.Forest Flora of Cape Colony – Thomas R. Sim (1907) In 1898 Heywood was succeeded by Colin MacNaughton as Conservator at Knysna,where he marked out the first permanent sample plots in the forests to study indigenous tree communities, laying a valuable foundation for research into forest ecosystems.http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/webapp/resourcecentre/Documents/Reports/Knysna%20&%20Tsitsikamma%20Forest%20-%20September%202009C.pdf McNaughton strongly believed that the ‘forests must be worked in the interests of the country, and not in the interests of the immediate population’. That is, trees should be considered a national resource, and not relevant to the livelihood of communities who exploited the forest.http://www.environmentandsociety.org/sites/default/files/key_docs/brown-7-4.pdf De Vasselot is commemorated in the de Vasselot Nature Reserve surrounding Nature's Valley. Marriage and family Médéric belonged to the Vasselot family, an old French noble family with origins dating back to the 14th century. Médéric was married on 5 October 1863 to Louise Suzanne Robinet de Plas (1844–1922), the daughter of Louis Augustin Ludovic Robinet de Plas (1813–1899) & Louise Marie Claire Picher (1824–1893).

From 1932 Fabre Line leased her to Services Contractuels des Messageries Maritimes, who ran her between the south of France and the Levant. After the fall of France in June 1940 the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine seized her in the Port of Haifa and placed her under the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Company. In November 1940 the Zionist movement Haganah planted a bomb aboard which sank her with the loss of between 260 and 300 lives. Patria remained a wreck in Haifa port until she was scrapped in 1952. With Fabre Line Fabre Line ordered Patria and her sister ship from Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée of La Seyne-sur-Mer, near Toulon. Patria had seven decks and three funnels, but one of the funnels was a dummy. Patria had nine boilers feeding two three-cylinder triple expansion steam engines. The cylinder bores were 30.4\\" (high pressure), 49.36\\" (medium pressure) and 70.55\\" (low pressure), all with a stroke of 51.2\\". The engines gave Patria a total of 900 NHP and propelled the ship by twin screws. Patria had direction finding equipment and was the first ocean liner to be equipped with a cinema. Patria was launched on 11 November 1913 and entered Fabre Line service on 15 or 16 April 1914. The New York Times reported that a German submarine attacked her on 1 March 1916 off the coast of Tunis. There is no naval record of such an attack, so it is not clear what incident may have taken place. However, the captain of the ship at the time, Pierre Deschelles, stated in an affidavit that while he didn't see the German submarine, members of the crew and many passengers did. She plied as a transatlantic liner between Marseille and New York from then until 1920, when she and Providence were reassigned to carrying emigrants to New York from Naples, Palermo and Marseille. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Messageries Maritimes withdrew Patria from the emigrant trade in 1930, although Providence continued to carry emigrants until 1932. With Messageries Maritimes On 19 January 1932 Fabre Line leased Patria for eight years to Messageries Maritimes, who placed her in service between the Levant and the south of France. Later that year, off the Ionian island of Zakynthos, Patria rescued three survivors from the sinking of a Greek vessel, the Tinios Stavtos. A Greek merchant ship, , rescued 25 survivors from the same incident. In 1934 Patria grounded on a bank while entering the Port of Alexandria in Egypt. In February 1939 Patria served as a hospital ship in the Spanish Civil War. On 1 January 1940 Fabre Line sold Patria to Messageries Maritimes. On 6 June 1940 she entered the Port of Haifa after sailing from Beirut. On 10 June Italy declared war on France and the UK. Any Allied ship passing Italy to reach France would now be in danger of attack, so Patria remained in port in Haifa. With British-India Steam Navigation On 22 June 1940 France surrendered to Germany, and on 25 June the British Mandatory Palestine authorities barred Patria from leaving Haifa. The British authorities seized Patria on 15 August and placed her under the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Co. She was assigned to be a troop ship, authorised to carry 1,800 troops (excluding the crew). She still had only enough lifeboats for the original 805 passengers and crew, so these were supplemented with liferafts. Despite her new designation Patria remained laid up in Haifa until the beginning of November 1940. In that month the Royal Navy intercepted three chartered ships; the , and , that were carrying Jewish refugees from German-occupied Europe to Palestine. The refugees lacked permits to enter Palestine so the British authorities ordered their deportation to British Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. Refugees from Pacific and Milos had been put aboard Patria, and embarkation of refugees from Atlantic had begun, when on 25 November a bomb planted by a Haganah agent blew a hole in the side of Patrias hull. She listed to that side and sank in 16 minutes, settling on the harbour bed with part of her hull and superstructure above water. By the time of the attack almost 1,800 refugees had been embarked aboard Patria, along with a crew of 130 and numerous British guards. The majority of those aboard were rescued but 172 were injured and between 260 and 300 were killed. The majority of victims were Jewish refugees but about 50 were crew and British guards; 209 bodies were recovered and buried in Haifa. Patria remained a wreck in Haifa port until 1952, when she was scrapped.

He has served as the Minister of Defence of Serbia from 29 June 2017. He previously served as the Minister of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy of Serbia from April 2014 to June 2017. He also served as director of the Office for Kosovo and Metohija from July 2012 to September 2013, and Minister without portfolio in the Government of Serbia in charge of Kosovo and Metohija from September 2013 to April 2014. Early years He was born in Lozovik, to a Serb father and a Romani mother. He finished primary school in Novi Sad, Grammar's School in Sremski Karlovci and later graduated from the University of Kragujevac Faculty of Law.Profil He stated that ever since his childhood \\"he has always been a communist\\". Vulin began his political career during the high school days in Novi Sad by supporting the Anti-bureaucratic revolution led by Slobodan Milošević between 1986 and 1989. Political career During the collapse of the communist Yugoslavia in 1990, Vulin joined the League of Communists – Movement for Yugoslavia, the so-called \\"army party\\" led by general Stevan Mirković. Vulin became a general secretary. In 1994, he was one of the founders of the Yugoslav Left, a party led by Mirjana Marković, the wife of Slobodan Milošević. In the new party, Vulin became a leader of the Revolutionary Youth, the party's youth organisation. He left the Yugoslav Left when it joined together with the Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia to the coalition with the Vojislav Šešelj's Serbian Radical Party in 1998. Later he founded the Democratic Left, and then the Movement of Socialists in August 2008. In 2012, following the 2012 Serbian parliamentary election after which Serbian Progressive Party-led coalition took power, which consisted of Vulin's Movement of Socialists, Vulin was named the director of newly established Office for Kosovo and Metohija. He stayed on the position until 2 September 2013 when he became the Minister without portfolio in charge of Kosovo and Metohija. Following the 2014 Serbian parliamentary election, leader of the Serbian Progressive Party Aleksandar Vučić formed the government on 27 April 2014 with Vulin being named the Minister of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy. He kept the office after the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election, in the second cabinet of Aleksandar Vučić. During his time in the office as Minister of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy, he was known for his often and fierce criticism directed towards Croatia, as well as occasional insulting of Croatian politicians and officials. In June 2017, Aleksandar Vučić gave mandate to Ana Brnabić to form the governmental cabinet. On 29 June 2017, the cabinet of Ana Brnabić was formed, with Vulin swapping minister positions with Zoran Đorđević to become the Minister of Defence. On April 21, 2018 Vulin was proclaimed persona non grata in Republic of Croatia after saying: \\"only the Supreme Commander of the Serbian Army – Aleksandar Vučić – can decide about me entering in Croatia, not Croatian ministers.\\" On 27 June 2020, Vulin tested positive for COVID-19.https://www.euronews.com/2020/06/27/serbian-defence-minister-tests- positive-for-coronavirus ReferencesExternal links 1972 births Living people People from Novi Sad Serbian people of Bosnia and Herzegovina descent League of Communists – Movement for Yugoslavia politicians Movement of Socialists politicians Government ministers of Serbia ","title":"Aleksandar Vulin"},{"id":"38676292","text":"88 Rue du Rhone is an independent brand of Swiss made watches, launched in 2012 by Elie and Pierre Bernheim, grandsons of the Swiss watchmaker Raymond Weil.

Plot  The film opens with a voice-over by Don, who states that in life and relationships, \\"anything can happen.\\" Ann works at a camera shop in a small town in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. One day, she gets called by her boyfriend who is in Prague and gets dumped by him. Ann makes a halfhearted suicide attempt by drinking a bottle of nail polish remover. After she leaves the hospital, her psychiatrist gives her the number of a crisis help line. One evening, still distraught over being abandoned by her boyfriend, Ann calls the number and speaks with Don, who volunteers there because he finds it less depressing to talk with other depressed people about their problems than to stay at home and feel sorry for himself. They make an emotional connection, but Ann hangs up on him when Don admits that he doesn't really know what love is. Ann begins making a series of emotional video tapes addressing her ex-boyfriend about how desolated she is by him leaving her. She gives the tapes to a neighbor who works at a package delivery service to send to Prague, but the neighbor secretly opens the packages, watches the tapes, and becomes infatuated with Ann. In an apparent coincidence some time after they spoke on the phone, Don walks into the camera shop where Ann works and buys a camera for his work as a real estate agent. Ann makes a comment about happiness being \\"unfair\\" that is similar to something she said to Don when she called the help line. He realizes who she is but does not say anything. Attracted to Ann, Don waits for her to finish work and approaches her. She invites him to help her do her wash at a local laundromat. They talk and she invites him to come to her house in a couple of days. Don comes over, and they have sex. Ann secretly tapes this encounter with the intention of sending the tape to her ex-boyfriend (but once again, the neighbor holds onto and watches the tape). After their encounter, Ann ducks Don's calls. A couple of days later, Don is asked by the police to persuade a man who he had been counseling to come out of a hotel room where he has a gun. Don talks to the man and prevents him from killing himself but is badly injured when the gun goes off. When Ann hears about what has happened, she rushes to the hospital and stays until Don is out of danger. Ann's ex- boyfriend calls to say he wants to get back together. Ann hastily packs and leaves town without leaving word to Don or her ex-boyfriend. Don goes home from the hospital and begins traveling frequently in his job as a real estate agent. The film ends with Don musing about what he would tell Ann if he saw her while he sits on a park bench. A woman walks by, looks at him, sits down, and smiles at him. He looks up and sees it is Ann. Before the credits roll, we hear a voice-over of Don saying again, \\"Anything can happen.\\"  Cast  * Lili Taylor as Ann * Andrew McCarthy as Don Henderson * Peggy West as Woman with Camera * Leslie Mann as Laurie * Sherilyn Lawson as Ice cream woman * Linda Ruth Goertz as Aurora * Kathryn Hurd as Muriel * Debi Mazar as Diane * Chanda Watts as Ann's nurse * Kathleen Edwards as Dr. Lewis * Alexis Arquette as Paul * Seymour Cassel as Frank * Karen Johnson Miller as wife Production Principal photography took place in Portland, Oregon.

It was written by Bathsheba Doran and directed by Michael Morris. The episode premiered on NBC on February 26, 2013, the fourth episode of Season 2. Derek and Tom help Veronica with her one-night-only concert, while Jimmy and Kyle, with Karen's encouragement, try to get a song submitted for the concert, and Julia and Peter struggle to work together to fix Bombshell's script.  Plot  Broadway star Veronica Moore (guest star Jennifer Hudson) hires Derek (Jack Davenport) to direct her one night only concert show. During the concert rehearsal, Veronica sings \\"I Got Love\\". Derek proposes a more sexed-up version, which Veronica and her mother Cynthia (Sheryl Lee Ralph) oppose. Veronica tries Derek's version but is uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Karen gets Tom Levitt (Christian Borle), the concert's musical director, to listen to Jimmy and Kyle pitch some songs for Veronica, to include partial versions of \\"Chest of Broken Hearts\\" and \\"I'm Not Lost\\". Tom doesn't think any of them are right for Veronica, so Kyle proposes he and Jimmy write a song. Jimmy and Kyle struggle with writing something that's right for Veronica; Karen gives him a suggestion that helps. They finish the song but Derek tells them never mind as he gives in to Veronica and her mother to let Veronica sing the songs she's comfortable with. Meanwhile, Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Peter (Daniel Sunjata) struggle to make improvements to Bombshell's script. Jimmy storms off and gets high, while Kyle looks for him and sings \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\", which is then continued by Veronica, who is changing her mind on doing things Derek's way. Tom has looked at Jimmy and Kyle's song and convinces Derek to use it in the concert. Karen finds a drugged up Jimmy and convinces him to come back to the stage and show everyone that he can handle rejection. Cynthia informs Derek and the group that the Bravo network will be filming the concert so they will have a large audience. Veronica finally tells Derek that she wants to do it his way and does his sexed-up version of \\"I Got Love\\" during the concert. At the end of the concert, Veronica introduces Jimmy and Kyle's new song \\"I Can't Let Go\\", and gets a standing ovation from the audience when she finishes.

It is a Grade I listed building.  History  In the 1670s, Tunbridge Wells had few permanent structures when it started to receive visits from members of the English Royal Family. The church was built on land belonging to Viscountess Purbeck as a chapel of ease for those visiting The Pantiles and was opened in 1676 after being constructed by Thomas Neale. It was dedicated to King Charles the Martyr: the cult of Charles I, who was executed in 1649 and whose son Charles II had been restored in 1660. While it was a chapel of ease, it served the parishes of Frant, Speldhurst and Tonbridge. When it was built, the church was the first substantial building constructed in Tunbridge Wells. The church had no resident vicar until 1709, and relied on visiting clergymen to conduct services. As Tunbridge Wells expanded, so did the church. After new parishes were created for the expanding town, the position of the chapel became an anomaly and it eventually became itself a parish church in 1889, but with an unusually small parochial area. It had been visited by the young Queen Victoria with her mother the Duchess of Kent, and a plaque was installed to commemorate this on the pew they sat in.  Design  The interior of the church The church was built using red bricks. The ceilings inside are made of plaster with five domes and were designed in 1678 by John Wetherell. In 1688, Henry Doogood, the chief plasterer of Sir Christopher Wren, expanded it. In 1846, a vestry and a schoolroom was added. In 1882, Ewan Christian re- orientated the church while adding a chancel and re-enforcing the church with steel. The panels either side of the altar in the new chancel came from a demolished church designed by Christopher Wren, St. Antolin, Budge Row, in the City of London.John Newman, West Kent and the Weald, Penguin Buildings of England, 1969 The boundary stone Outside the church is a stone set into the pavement which marked the parish boundaries of Speldhurst, Tonbridge and Frant, and also of Kent and Sussex before the county boundaries were redrawn.

It is also a Grade II listed building.  History  Construction was completed in 1902 to designs by architect John Briggs. When it was opened, it had a capacity of 1,100. In 1913, the Opera House hosted a series of charity fundraising concerts gather funds to rebuild the Nevill Ground's cricket pavilion after the original pavilion was destroyed in a suffragette arson attack. The Opera House was purchased by Union Cinemas in 1931 and turned into a cinema. The Opera House was bombed in the Second World War. The bomb did not explode but instead got caught in the proscenium arch above the stage and set fire to the inside of the Opera House, leading to a renovation before eventual re-opening in 1949. It was later turned into a bingo hall in the 1960s after threats to demolish it. In November 1966, the Opera House was granted Grade II listed status. In 1996, the Opera House was purchased by J D Wetherspoon and was turned into a public house. In 2006, the Opera House again hosted an opera performance, of Handel's Tamerlano. More recently there have been annual performances by Kent-based ‘The Merry Opera Company’ with Troy Boy, La traviata, The Magic Flute, Kiss Me, Figaro!, The Barber of Seville, and in 2016, La Boheme.  Design  The Opera House The interior was designed in Edwardian Baroque and Neo-Georgian styles. The exterior includes a Baroque dome on the roof. The dome originally had a nude statue of Mercury on the top, which was removed in the 1920s, either because it was unstable in poor weather or was viewed as sinful by local residents. In 1923, the main staircase was altered to include an 18th-century painting of revelers.

Maltby, adapted from a French original, Azaïs, by Louis Verneuil and Georges Berr. It was the penultimate work of the series of Aldwych farces that ran nearly continuously at the Aldwych Theatre in London from 1923 to 1933. The play centres on the sudden rise of an impoverished music teacher to become manager of a grand casino. The piece opened on 5 September 1932 and ran until 21 January 1933, a total of 161 performances.\\"Mr. Ralph Lynn\\", The Times, 10 August 1962, p. 11 A film adaptation was made in 1933 under the title Just My Luck.\\"Just My Luck\\", British Film Institute, accessed 1 March 2013 Background Fifty-Fifty was the eleventh in the series of twelve Aldwych farces. The first four in the series, It Pays to Advertise, A Cuckoo in the Nest, Rookery Nook and Thark had long runs, averaging more than 400 performances each. Subsequent productions had been less outstandingly successful, and the decision of the producer, Tom Walls, not to appear in the previous play, Dirty Work had disappointed audiences who had relished his stage chemistry with his co-star Ralph Lynn.\\"Aldwych Theatre\\", The Times, 8 March 1932, p. 12 Three of the familiar favourites in the Aldwych team took roles in the new production alongside Lynn: Robertson Hare, a figure of harassed respectability, Mary Brough, famous for her eccentric old ladies, and Winifred Shotter, the leading lady. The public had grown used to farces written specially for the company by Ben Travers, and critics noted that the parts in the new piece were not tailor- made for Hare and Brough as Travers's characters always were. The play had already been seen in London in Maltby's translation, in a production at the Strand Theatre in 1929. On that occasion it was given under the title Azaïs and was less anglicised than the version presented at the Aldwych.\\"Repertory Players\\", The Times, 30 September 1929, p. 9 One member of the Strand cast was recruited for the Aldwych production, Clive Morton, who reprised his character, the Viscount de Langeais, though renamed La Coste. Original Aldwych cast *Montague Trigg – Robertson Hare *Francis – Gordon James *Lady Croft – Maidie Hope *Peggy Croft – Winifred Shotter *Sir Charles Croft – Morris Harvey *David Blake – Ralph Lynn *Signor Stromboli – Frederick Burtwell *Typist – Joan Brierley *Madame Heffer – Mary Brough *Attendant – Cameron Carr *Vicomte La Coste – Clive Morton *Countess Romani – Dorothy Boyd *Pan Osnar Rizzi – R Cameron Hall Synopsis Azaïs, the French philosopher, postulated that happiness and misery are equally balanced. This \\"fifty-fifty\\" theory is a great comfort to David Blake. Blake is a penurious music teacher, aged thirty- five; he feels that having spent the first half of his threescore years and ten in poverty and unhappiness, Azaïs' principle should mean that his remaining years ought to be comfortable and happy. He greatly envies Stromboli, a man of his own age who has never known failure and is full of self-confidence. Buoyed up by the thought that, according to Azaïs, the roles are due to be reversed for the next thirty-five years, he spends what little money he has on a new suit, shaves off his scrubby moustache, transforming his appearance from pitiable to debonair. He impresses the impetuous entrepreneur Sir Charles Croft, owner of the casino and hotel in St Nectare, who engages him at sight to run it. Blake is beset by a gallery of strange characters. Stromboli does indeed find his fortune on the wane, and his confidence ebbs and his sweet nature comes to the fore just as Blake is becoming overweening. The old woman who lives next door is enraged when Blake makes a success of the casino, disturbing her peace. One of the residents is a young aristocrat in love with Peggy, Croft's daughter, and tormented by amorous visions caused by the gurgle of her bathwater in the adjoining suite. Sir Charles is enamoured of a revue star. His wife is so irritated by his roving eye that she writes herself love letters from imaginary admirers in a successful attempt to bring him to heel. Croft's secretary is plotting Blake's downfall, and eventually secures the managership for himself. Throughout all this, Peggy has been quietly in love with Blake, and at the conclusion they are united. Critical reception The critics praised the players but thought little of the play. Ivor Brown in The Manchester Guardian commented that to call it an Aldwych farce was a misnomer, and there was a consensus that the piece was too slow and too weak.Brown, Ivor. \\"Fifty-Fifty\\", The Manchester Guardian, 6 September 1932, p. 13; \\"The Playhouses\\", Illustrated London News, 17 September 1932, p. 440; and \\"Aldwych Theatre\\", The Times, 6 September 1932, p. 10 The Illustrated London News observed, \\"The Aldwych authors have taught us to expect a laugh in every line, but Mr. H.

Starring Bambang Hermanto and Nurbani Jusuf, it follows a young woman who is kidnapped by a group of bandits, only to fall in love with their leader. The film, adapted from the 1940 novel of the same name by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, was repeatedly blacklisted by the Indonesian government and only saw release several years after production ended.  Plot  Medasing (Bambang Hermanto) is the fierce leader of a group of robbers who joined them after his parents were killed. He and his gang track the movements of a rich merchant (Rd Ismail) and his family, who are returning from a successful business trip. While the family is sleeping in the woods, Medasing and his men sneak into the camp, where they kill most of the porters and merchant. Leaving the merchant's wife behind, Medasing takes the merchant's daughter Sayu (Nurbani Jusuf) with him. He brings her to their hideout, where she is held captive. Sayu discovers that, despite his fierce exterior, Medasing has a kind heart. He does not allow any of the gang to treat her improperly, and she is essentially free to act as she pleases. Over the months, Sayu and her kind heart are able to stir Medasing and prompt him to change his ways. After the members of his gang are killed in various mishaps, Medasing is gravely injured. Sayu tends to his wounds, and in return he brings her back to her village. They are married, and Medasing slowly rejoins society.  Production  Sayu descending the steps at the bandits' hideout The film was directed and produced by Usmar Ismail for his production company PERFINI. It saw Max Tera collaborating with Kasdullah and Kosnen on camera, with the film shot in black-and-white. Ardi Ahmad served as artistic director. In post-production Jack Lesmana handled music while Kemal Redha and E Sambas did sound. The film was edited by three persons: Soemardjono, Janis Badar, and SK Syamsuri. Its cast included Bambang Hermanto, Nurbani Jusuf in the starring roles, as well as Bambang Irawan, Rachmat Hidayat, and Rd Ismail. Ismail adapted Anak Perawan di Sarang Penjamun from the novel of the same name by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana. Initially printed as a serial, the novel had been published in 1940 by Pustaka Rakyat. Ismail advertised it as the first film adaptation of an Indonesian novel. However, several adaptations had been released previously, including an adaptation of Marah Roesli's Sitti Nurbaya by Lie Tek Swie in 1941.  Release and reception  Anak Perawan di Sarang Penjamun was produced beginning in 1962. At the time tensions between leftist and rightist movements, both in politics and the arts, were reaching a high. The Communist Party of Indonesia-allied arts group Lekra would call for the Sukarno government to block films by non-Lekra filmmakers as anti-revolutionary. After a press screening on 26 February 1964, Anak Perawan di Sarang Penjamun was challenged by Lekra; a review in Warta Bhakti considered the film to \\"betrayal the [Indonesian people's] struggle\\", owing to the film's pro-Malay sentiment during the ongoing confrontation with Malaysia. However, the Indonesian film historian Salim Said suggests that the film was condemned not because of its plot, but because of Alsijahbana's alliance to the Socialist Party of Indonesia. In response to this challenge, Ismail removed Alisjahbana's name from the film's credits. This move was unable to placate Lekra, and it was eventually banned from release. After the 30 September Movement and the ensuing anti-communist purge, the Communist Party and most leftists were destroyed. Anak Perawan di Sarang Penjamun, however, remained blacklisted because of Hermanto's previous membership in the Communist Party. A VHS edition was ultimately released in the 1990s.

The film is an example of the found footage genre and stars Bradley Cole, Brittany Ashworth, Angela Forrest and Oliver Lee. It was filmed on location in Yorkshire and Suffolk and released on 1 October 2007 at the Raindance Film Festival. It was the last film that prolific stuntman Roy Alon worked on.http://www.movievortex.com/feature/budget-defying-films/ Plot Judith King (known as \\"Angel\\" by her father) lives with her brother (Joe), dad (Andy) and mum (Sheila) in the UK. Judith has been given a video camera to replace another that had gotten broken. At first the family seems incredibly happy, caring and fun-loving. Judith is becoming withdrawn though; she is a lesbian and hasn't come out to her family yet, and she has a crush on Claire, a teenage girl across the street who sunbathes in a bikini. She often spies on Claire and films her from the bedroom window. While at a beach trip to see their new house, Judith tries to convince her dad not to make the family move away, but is unable to tell him about her crush on Claire. She records the situation on her new camera and also reveals that she is an avid photographer. While filming Claire, she gets caught by Andy's businessman friend, Ray, who seems to figure out why Judith is so secretive, however he keeps her secret and says nothing about Claire in front of Judith's parents. Joe soon catches Judith filming Claire too but Judith hides under a table before Claire can catch her. Andy is trying to get a promotion but financial strain and pressure from the family begin to push him further from reality. He begins smoking (Judith films him with a night vision filter), having mood swings and even builds a swimming pool much to Sheila's annoyance. She tells him he needs to grow up and see reality because they are trying to sell the house, not add to it. Judith becomes terrified when she films Andy coming home with blood on his clothes at night. When Shelia asks him what happened, he reveals that unfortunately Ray was injured and has had half his face torn off. The doctors don't know if Ray will be able to talk again. Shelia feels bad for Ray because in this state he will most likely lose his salesman job, and Judith believes that there's something more sinister going on. It begins to seem likely that Andy is not going to get the promotion or be able to sell the house, and this leaves him more and more mentally unbalanced. Shelia begins to frequently fight and argue with him. One night Judith hides in the garden and Andy tries to grab her; she screams and runs back inside, locking the door behind her in her bedroom. Joe begins to hate Andy and swears at him, belittles him and tells him how much he resents him. This is especially evident when Andy tries to film a video to send to a reality television company in exchange for money and Joe goofs off repeatedly. Judith also finds a garbage bag full of hundreds of used lottery tickets belonging to Andy. When the new pool is built, the Kings hold a pool party during their open house, playing fun music and throwing a barbecue with lots of food. Judith is saddened that Andy did not invite Ray, but Ray finds out about the party anyway and shows up, getting angry and nearly attacking Andy. Ray appears to be going through some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder and half is face is bandaged. Andy escorts him outside, and unknown to him, Judith follows with her video camera. She ends up discovering that Ray thinks Andy was the one who injured him and Ray's speech is slurred from the damage to his face. Andy tells him off but then Ray drives away and mentions that Andy just wanted to try to take his job away, revealing that Andy has been lying to the family about the future of his career and that Ray got the promotion over him. Andy grabs onto Ray's taxi but falls over on his face instead. Judith becomes extremely worried about the state of her family. Andy tries to show her video camera to the guests only to discover to his horror that Judith has been filming all of his weird outbursts and behavioral issues. Unable to afford their new dream house, the Kings hole up in their old house and Judith earns a new nickname from Andy - \\"our resident snoop\\". Appalled, Sheila goes to work and the kids go to school. Andy explores the house and discovers, while filming with the video camera, that Shelia has a dildo locked up in the bedside table and that she favours Joe over Judith as a result of post-partom depression she suffered years ago. He also finds a photo of himself on Joe's dartboard with a dart stuck in it. He finds that Joe has a stash of illegal drugs, and a video of Joe getting a blowjob from Claire - in Andy and Sheila's bedroom. He eventually discovers a secret shrine in a box that Judith has built with photos of Claire in a bikini, realizing that this is why Judith never wanted to move away. On camera, Andy admits that he was the one who hurt Ray to try and get the promotion while Ray was incapacitated. Upon returning home, Shelia, Judith and Joe go to bed but are woken up by a smoke alarm in the house. They discover that Andy, having a mental breakdown, has locked all the doors and windows and has shut off the lights. He then reveals everything he has discovered about the dysfunctional family, including Judith's secret infatuation with Claire. Judith is devastated that her father would betray her trust and privacy, and Shelia and Joe realize that enough is enough - either they have to leave or Andy does. An angry Sheila also blurts out that years ago she was pregnant with Andy's third child, but she secretly aborted it because she feared another depressive episode. The next day, Judith returns home from a visit with Claire to discover that her father is about to commit suicide on camera. Horrified, she hugs him and cries, only to be choked or smothered to death by Andy. He goes upstairs and bludgeons Joe to death as well before bringing his body downstairs. Sheila walks downstairs following Andy’s unsuccessful attempt to kill her in the same manner, and screams when she discovers Andy piling the children's bodies together. He murders Sheila by repeatedly whacking her head against the floor, and then tells them he's going to be back with his family. He hits the camera causing it to roll in front of Judith's face which reveals she is still alive as her breath is visible on the lens. Andy then whacks and breaks the camera one final time before the credits roll. Judith's fate left unknown.

The disaster started at 3:25 PM PDT (22:25 UTC) when an underground gasoline pipeline ruptured due to various errors and malfunctions on the part of Olympic Pipeline and others.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ts55dby4og&t;=1507 The gasoline vapors exploded at 5:02 PM PDT, sending a fireball down Whatcom Creek. Three people died in the accident. Background Olympic Pipeline Company runs a network of fuel pipes beginning at refineries in Whatcom County and Anacortes and running south to Seattle and Portland, Oregon. In 1999, the pipeline was owned and operated by Equilon, a joint venture between Shell and Texaco. Today the pipeline is owned by BP.Smoke above the fireSmoke above the fire on June 10, 1999 shortly after the explosion. Disaster The disaster began as Olympic Pipeline was transporting gasoline from Cherry Point Refinery to terminals in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. A pressure relief valve that was not configured properly failed to open in the pipeline, which resulted in a surge of pressure after an automatic valve shut for unknown reasons. This resulted in the line rupturing at 3:25 that afternoon, and gasoline began spilling into adjacent Hanna and Whatcom Creeks. As the gasoline continued to spill, many people in the area called 911 to report the leak, and an Olympic Pipeline employee who was in the area called the company to report it.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR0202.pdf When the Bellingham Fire Department arrived, massive amounts of gasoline had turned the creek pink, and the fumes were overwhelming. The fire department notified Olympic Pipeline of the leak and evacuated the area around the creek. The gasoline exploded at 5:02 PM. The black smoke plume extended to an altitude of and the smoke from the explosion was visible from Vancouver to Anacortes. The fire exceeded . Local businesses were evacuated, Interstate 5 was closed to traffic, and the Coast Guard stopped maritime traffic in Bellingham Bay in anticipation of the fire travelling the entire length of the creek. However, the fire never extended past Interstate 5. Emergency responders stopped the fires by 6:30 PM; the smoke dissipated by 7:00. Victims Three people died in the incident. The first was Liam Wood, 18, who was fly fishing in the creek. He succumbed to the fumes, fell unconscious into the creek and drowned, dying before the explosion. Two children, Wade King and Stephen Tsiorvas, both 10, were playing near the creek confluence during the explosion. Both survived the blast, but sustained severe burns, dying the next day at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. There were eight related injuries. Damage Property damage was estimated at $58,455,927, most of it caused by the explosion. Many nearby buildings had broken windows. One house was completely destroyed. The city's water treatment plant was near the explosion site, and while the building itself survived, everything inside was destroyed. The rupture allowed of gasoline to escape into the creek bed. Bellingham water treatment personnel were forced to manually add water treatment chemicals to keep the water supply safe until the plant could be rebuilt. Authorities all noted that the destruction and death toll were much lower than would be expected from such a large explosion. This was due to the explosion being centered in a large, forested park; the fires mostly staying in Whatcom Creek; and the ignition occurring before more gasoline had leaked, which would have resulted in a much larger explosion. The cause of ignition was determined by Bellingham Fire Dept to be a butane lighter in the possession of King and Tsiorvas. Investigation After a three-year investigation, investigators pointed to a series of failures, and not just a single error, most of which were the fault of Olympic Pipeline. Olympic Pipeline had failed to properly train employees, and had to contend with a faulty computer SCADA system and pressure relief valve. In 1994, five years before the accident, an IMCO construction crew, working on behalf of the City of Bellingham damaged the pipeline while constructing the city's water treatment plant, and Olympic Pipeline had failed to find or repair the damage. Olympic, Equilon and several employees faced a seven count indictment after the investigation in 2002. The companies pleaded guilty to several of the charges, leading to a $112 million settlement, a record at the time. This was the first conviction against a pipeline company under the 1979 Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act.

While maintaining a partisan bias, it is a secular organization open to all persons regardless of race, colour, creed, religion, gender, or political preference. Currently there is only one club in located in the Waterloo Region of Ontario, Canada. Members and guests usually meet on the third Thursday of every month for lunch at the Kitchener Crowne Plaza Hotel while listening to a guest speaker. The primary motto of the Confederation Club is to be a \\"Speakers forum for a Canadian viewpoint\\" as luncheon guest speakers present on distinctly Canadian topics.  History  For several years before its creation, executive members in the Waterloo Region of Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario Associations had talked about some kind of joint project to network and discuss political and economic issues. In late 1975, Wayne Wettlaufer, newly arrived from the Honourable Walter Baker's riding in Ottawa, suggested the idea of a Confederation Club that was a lunch time project of several Ottawa Riding Associations. Wayne Wettlaufer became the founding President and first Honorary Life Member. The first executive would include Monty Monteith, Christina Weylie, Jeanne Foster and Brock Foster. Other members of the first executive that were actively involved included representatives of the riding associations from Waterloo Region and Wellington County: Carl Sulliman who was President of the Waterloo Federal Progressive Conservative Riding; Rich Hobson who wrote the Constitution; Barb Hull and Rod Nelson who were the early secretaries; and Dave Zimmer, Bill Barlow, John Cosman, Dorothy Beke, Jack Wallace and Marjorie Kunza. At the founding meeting, a relatively young unknown, Joe Clark was the honoured guest speaker. Within a month after his appearance at the Confederation Club he had become Party Leader, Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and the Honorary President of Confederation Club..  Student History Awards The idea of presenting Confederation Club Student History Awards was put forward in 1980 by John Boulden, a history teacher at then Kitchener Collegiate Institute. John was a Director of the Confederation Club for a number of the Club's early years and advocated for the idea that students should learn about and participate in the democracy in which we live while taking an active role in civic life. The Confederation Club endorsed this idea and in May 1980 the Confederation Club Student History Awards were commenced to encourage this learning and participation. Each year students in the graduating classes in high schools of the Waterloo Region are chosen by their teachers for their high standings in their history studies.

Although Newcastle scored again, Chelsea came back with three goals in the last ten minutes to win 6–5. After more than a year out with a spinal injury that he thought might end his career, Hughes returned to Newcastle's first team in March 1963 with two goals against Bradford City in the FA Cup. After Peterborough United failed to sign him ahead of the April transfer deadline, Hughes signed for Second Division Derby County for a £10,000 fee. He played more than 200 times for Derby, then joined Lincoln City towards the end of the 1967–68 season. He spent three years in the Fourth Division with Lincoln, playing 131 games in all competitions, and was released in March 1971. He then moved into non-league football with Northern Premier League club Boston United, managed by former Lincoln teammate Jim Smith. He helped them reach the third round proper of the FA Cup in 1971–72, and ended his Boston career at the end of that season.

New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936. Biography In Context. Web. 1 Mar. 2013. was an Irish American poet. Early years and education Mary Elizabeth McGrath was born in Dungarvan, Ireland, and passed away in Boston, Massachusetts. The oldest daughter of Patrick McGrath, a marble worker, and Mary Murphy McGrath. In 1850, her family emigrated to the United States and settled in Quincy, Massachusetts. Her father was well-read and opened a successful marble works, thus, following her graduation from Quincy High School, was able to send his daughter to George Barrell Emerson's Private School in Boston from 1859 to 1861 and Academy of the Sacred Heart in Manhattanville, New York from 1861 to 1863 to study music and modern languages. Career She worked as a schoolteacher prior to her June 1865 marriage to Dr. John G. Blake, a graduate of Harvard Medical School who had admired her published poems before they met in person. They had eleven children; of the six that survived into adulthood, five boys graduated from Harvard University and one daughter graduated from Radcliffe College. As a teenager, her poetry was published in The Pilot under the name Marie. She became widely published in other in Boston publications, including the Boston Gazette, the Boston Transcript, and the Boston Journal, the latter of which featured her popular series of \\"Rambling Talks\\". A devout Catholic, she was also frequently published in religious publications like Catholic World and the Protestant The Congregationalist and in national publications like Scribner's. She wrote poetry to commemorate Boston memorials and events, including the deaths of abolitionist Wendell Phillips and Admiral David Dixon Porter, the Silver Jubilee of Archbishop John Joseph Williams, and the 150th anniversary of the Charitable Irish Society of Boston. Her admirers included Theodore Roosevelt and Oliver Wendell Holmes, the latter of whom wrote of her \\"You are one of the birds that must sing.\\" Though widely admired in her day, the critical reputation of her work does not equal the esteem of her admirers. Blake was a passionate traveller who created an image that a housewife must not stop to think of her responsibilities. \\"The stay-at-home weight will be so overwhelming in a proportion that she could not be propelled away by anything short of a catapult.\\" Her first collection of poetry, Poems, was not published until 1882. Blake's first book was inspired by nature, but her biggest inspiration towards her poems was her family. Blake created several poems on the death of children that portray the times about childhood mortality. Her poems contemplate an attitude towards women's roles: Simple Story and What the Wife’s Heart Said desire women to be pleased while serving their husbands and families. Her poem The Ballad of Elizabeth Zane and Isabella of Castille (1890) conveys appreciation for spirited, independent women.Blake, Mary. “Mary Elizabeth McGrath Blake” WA 14 Elizabeth Long.

She later published the collections Verses along the Way (1890) and In the Harbour of Hope (1907) and two volumes of children's verse, The Merry Months All (1885) and Youth in Twelve Centuries (1886). She published three volumes of travel writing: On the Wing (1883), about her trip to the western United States, serialized in the Boston Journal; Mexico: Picturesque, Political, Progressive (1888), a collaboration with Margaret F. Sullivan; and A Summer Holiday in Europe (1890), three of her five trips to Europe were with her children. Blake actively participated in the American Peace Society that influenced her work life and her poems. Her criticism of militarism, The Coming Reform: A Woman's Word (1887), was popular during the Spanish–American War.

The evolution of the queue can be described by the Lindley equation. The system is described in Kendall's notation where the G denotes a general distribution for both interarrival times and service times and the 1 that the model has a single server. Different interarrival and service times are considered to be independent, and sometimes the model is denoted GI/GI/1 to emphasise this. Waiting time Kingman's formula gives an approximation for the mean waiting time in a G/G/1 queue. Lindley's integral equation is a relationship satisfied by the stationary waiting time distribution which can be solved using the Wiener–Hopf method. Multiple servers Few results are known for the general G/G/k model as it generalises the M/G/k queue for which few metrics are known. Bounds can be computed using mean value analysis techniques, adapting results from the M/M/c queue model, using heavy traffic approximations, empirical results or approximating distributions by phase type distributions and then using matrix analytic methods to solve the approximate systems. In a G/G/2 queue with heavy-tailed job sizes, the tail of the delay time distribution is known to behave like the tail of an exponential distribution squared under low loads and like the tail of an exponential distribution for high loads.

It cost £300 million to build and is expected to employ about 6,000 when fully developed. The park was opened on 26 September 2011, 25 years after it was originally proposed. The site covers 59 acres, half of which were developed by 2013; the whole site is expected to be complete by 2033. The main building comprises the Forum, which includes a reception area and two areas for businesses: the Innovation Centre for emerging businesses and the Grow On Centre for expanded businesses. The park's largest tenant is the National Composites Centre. History First proposed in 1986, the Bristol and Bath Science Park was officially opened on 26 September 2011. The park's development was a collaboration of universities, the South West of England Regional Development Agency and Quantum Property Partnership. It cost £300 million to build, and was intended to draw technology firms to the South West, giving them a space to develop technical designs for production. The site covers 59 acres, and is expected to employ 6,000. By 2013, 29 acres of the site had been developed, leaving a wide open common where children come to skateboard and play frisbee. The original intention was to create a building every year in the hope that more businesses would move in, but this was suspended after two years due to a recession. The remainder of the site is expected to take between 15 and 20 years to develop. The main building includes the \\"Forum\\", which comprises the reception area, meeting spaces and restaurants. It also includes the \\"Innovation Centre\\" for new business, and the \\"Grow On Centre\\" for subsequent expansion. The ground floor of the Innovation Centre was full by November 2012, and the second floor was half full by February 2013. By 2016, 40 companies were based at the site. The park's largest tenant is the National Composites Centre, a carbon fibre research centre opened by Vince Cable in November 2011, which is part of the government's High Value Manufacturing Catapult initiative. The centre was granted £28 million of government funding in 2012 and a further £65.4m in 2018. In September 2018, the University of Bath and South Gloucestershire Council jointly purchased the park from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The purchase price was reported to be £18 million. In January 2019 a major expansion of the National Composites Centre, under the Airbus Wing of Tomorrow programme, was agreed. Green energy The park's first two buildings have 200 square metres of solar panels, which aimed to provide between 10 and 15% of the building's energy requirements. The park also includes a solar water heating system and a woodchip biomass boiler. The Forum building houses the world's largest solar-powered chandelier, designed by Luke Jerram.

Overview IAS 2 defines inventories as assets which are: *held for sale in the ordinary course of business, *in the process of production for such sale, or *in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or rendering of services. IAS 2 requires that those assets that are considered inventory should be recorded at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost not only includes the purchase cost but also the conversion costs, which are the costs involved in bringing inventory to its present condition and location, such as direct labour. IAS 2 also allows for the capitalisation of variable overheads and fixed overheads so long as the fixed overheads are allocated on a systematic and consistent basis and in respect to usual output levels. Where output is lower than expected the resultant excessive overhead should be considered an expense and not capitalised but when output is abnormally high the fixed overhead allocated to each unit must be decreased so as not to overvalue the inventory. In the event of there being multiple products produced from one process, such as a main product and a by-product, where the costs are not clearly separated, the costs should be allocated “on a rational and consistent basis”, such as based on the market value of each unit once the two products become separate. IAS 2 does not allow for the capitalisation of: *(a) the cost of abnormal levels of waste, *(b) storage costs where the storage is not part of the production process, *(c) administrative costs, *(d) selling costs. The valuation of work in progress on construction and service contracts falls outside IAS 2 (IFRS 15 applies instead); similarly for financial instruments, IAS 32 and IFRS 9 apply and for biological assets arising from agricultural activity, IAS 41 applies instead of IAS 2.PKF, IAS 2 Inventories Summary, accessed 17 December 2016 For the capitalisation of borrowing costs in inventories, consult “IAS 23 Borrowing Costs”. IAS 2 allows for two methods of costing, the standard technique and the retail technique. The standard technique requires that inventory be valued at the standard cost of each unit; that is, the usual cost per unit at the normal level of output and efficiency. The retail technique values the inventory by taking its sales value and then reducing it by the relevant gross profit margin. Where items of inventory are not ordinarily interchangeable or where certain items are earmarked for specific projects, these items are required to have their specific costs identified and assigned to them individually. IAS 2 also requires the use of the First-in, First-out (FIFO) principle whereby those items which have been in stock the longest are considered to be the items that are being used first, ensuring that those items which are held in inventory at the reporting date are valued at the most recent price. As an alternative, costs of inventories may be assigned by using the weighted average cost formula. The value of inventories must be recorded at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Where net realisable value drops to below the cost of inventory the loss is to be recognised as an expense in the period in which the drop of value occurs.

She holds several distinctions including becoming the first woman from her community to wear an upper cloth, the first Scheduled Caste woman graduate in India, a science graduate, a member of the Cochin Legislative Council and of being one of nine female members of the Constituent Assembly of India.But it is not correct to mention that she was the first woman from her community to wear an upper cloth.Her elder sister and her mother Thayyithara Maani may be given this credit prior to her. Mother Maani lived lived up to the post independent period in India and died in 1959AD. Honouring Dakshayani Velayudhan, the first and only Dalit woman MLA, the Kerala government has constituted the ‘Dakshayani Velayudhan Award’ which will be given to women who contributed in empowering other women in the state. The budget earmarked Rs 2 crore for the award.Dakshayani Velayudhan Award This was announced by the Kerala Finance Minister Dr. Thomas Isaac during the presentation of Kerala Budget 2019 in the Legislative Assembly on 31st January 2019.Kerala Budget 2019: Highlights  Early life and education  Dakshayani was born in the Mulavukad village of the Kanayannur taluka of Ernakulam district in 1912. She completed her B.A. in 1935 and went on to complete her teachers' training course from the Madras University three years later. Her studies were supported by scholarships from the government of the Cochin State. From 1935 to 1945 she worked as a teacher at the Government High Schools in Trichur and Tripunithura.  Family  Dakshayani belonged to the Pulaya community, just like her contemporary social worker KPVallon K. P. Vallon.She married R. Velayudhan a Scheduled Caste leader and later Member of Parliament. Their wedding was held at Sevagram in Wardha with Gandhi and Kasturba as witnesses and a leper standing in as the priest. The couple had five children Dr. Reghu (previously doctor for Smt. Indira Gandhi), Prahladan, Dhruvan, Bhagirath [Secretary General, The Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)] and Meera. She was also related to K R Narayanan who later became the President of India.  Parliamentary career  In 1945 Dakshayani was nominated to the Cochin Legislative Council by the government of the State. = Participation in the Constituent Assembly = Velayudhan was elected to the Constituent Assembly of India by the Council in 1946. She was the first and only Scheduled Caste woman to be elected to the constituent assembly. From 1946-1952 she served as a member of the Constituent Assembly and the Provisional Parliament of India. In Parliament she took special interest in the matters of education especially that of the Scheduled Castes.  Interventions in the Constituent Assembly  Although a staunch Gandhian, Dakshayani sided with B R Ambedkar on many issues relating to the Scheduled Castes during the Constituent Assembly debates. She agreed with Ambedkar giving up the demand for separate electorates arguing instead for 'moral safeguards' and the immediate removal of their social disabilities. On 8 November 1948, after Dr BR Ambedkar introduced the draft Constitution for discussion, she expressed her appreciation for the draft while calling for greater decentralisation. She also suggested that the final draft of the Constitution should be adopted following a ratification through a general election. She intervened again on 29 November 1948, during discussions on draft Article 11, which aimed at prohibiting discrimination on the basis of caste, and was permitted to exceed the time limit by the Vice President of the Constituent Assembly who said, \\"It is only because you are a lady I am allowing you.\\" Velayudhan called for implementation of non-discrimination provisions through public education and pointed out that it would send a great public signal if the Constituent Assembly were to endorse a resolution condemning caste discrimination. \\"The working of the Constitution,\\" she said, \\"will depend on how people conduct themselves in the future, not on the actual execution of the law.\\" She also contested the general elections of 1971 from the Adoor Lok Sabha constituency but ended up fourth in a fray of five candidates.  Later life and death  Dakshayani was president of the Depressed Classes Youths Fine arts Club and the Managing Editor of The Common Man in Madras from 1946-49. She later became the founder president of the Mahila Jagriti Parishad. Dakshayani died after a short illness in July 1978. She was 66.

Kornbluth. Plot summary The prologue introduces the setting, a future North America divided between rival criminal gangs the Syndic on the East Coast and the Mob in Chicago, who have driven the federal government into exile in Iceland, Ireland and other North Atlantic islands. Life has more or less returned to normal in Syndic territory – as long as protection money is paid on time. The rest of the world has collapsed into either peasant life or tribalism. Attitudes to sex are generally tolerant, with free sex outside of marriage and both polygamy and polyandry accepted. (However, male homosexuality is not, and lesbianism is never mentioned.) The protagonist, Charles Orsino, is a low- ranking member of the Syndic who collects protection money in New York. After a failed assassination attempt, he is invited to a meeting of the leaders of the Syndic, who suspect that the exiled government were responsible. To discover the truth, Charles volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the government, with a false personality created by hypnosis to fool lie detectors. He is taken to the main naval base on the shores of Ireland. He also visits Ireland outside of government territory: it is tribal and governed by sorceresses who have genuine powers of telepathy. It is mentioned in passing that England is also tribal and much weaker. While escaping home, he also visits Mob territory and finds it much more disorganised. He proposes that the Syndic becomes more like a regular government to protect itself. But his mentor rejects this, and the book ends on that note. Reception and influences The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction noted that the novel had wrongly been seen as \\"deficient\\" in comparison with Kornbluth's collaborative work, concluding that aspects of the Syndic government structure were \\"effective and even prophetic.\\" The novel's exploration of agorism or anarcho- capitalism proved popular with libertarians. The novel also explored the underexplored topic of a mafia state, or mafianism, in a positive light. The novel had an influence on Samuel Edward Konkin III, who considered it an under appreciated classic. It was also inducted into the Prometheus Award Hall of Fame in 1986.

After a series of drug-dealing convictions he was found guilty of an assault, his third strike in the Texas Three Strikes Law, which sentenced him to 25 years in Huntsville State Prison. While in prison he developed a characteristic drawing style involving detailed patterning and line work, and was discovered at a prison art show by William Steen, who sold Clark's work to national and international buyers. Clark died on July 29, 2006, the victim of a robbery and murder in his home. Life Born in 1936 in the small town of Bartlett, Texas, Clark's family moved to Houston. Young Henry dropped out of school after the sixth grade to \\"go up on the streets.\\" According to Henry, as a young teenager he was schooled by his uncle in the ways of street hustling and gambling. Henry Ray Clark was a compelling figure in both appearance and personality. Handsome, with deep blue eyes, he came to be known on the streets of Houston as \\"Pretty Boy\\" and then \\"The Magnificent Pretty Boy\\", either by his own naming or by one of the many women who knew him. Clark's life of drug dealing, pimping, and other hustles always left him feeling on the verge of the next last score that would set him up for life. In 1977, following a series of drug-dealing convictions, he was found guilty of assault (he shot at a man who tried to run off with Clark's gambling take) and sentenced under Texas' \\"Three Strikes\\" Law to 25 years in Huntsville State Prison. There, Clark was introduced to the prison arts programs and began to draw. Clark found that drawing provided him with a release from the confinement of prison. Using ballpoint pens and salvaged manila envelopes, he created images of far-off galactic worlds inhabited by powerful beings. On July 13, 2006, Clark, aged 69, was shot in the arm and abdomen by two home invaders; he remained in a coma and on life support at Ben Taub Hospital until his death on July 29. Works Drawing in colored ballpoint pen on any scrap of paper he could get his hands on, preferably manila envelopes, Clark drew clocks and figures; he drew the planets he said he visited in a spaceship in his dreams. Art and dreaming — tools to engineer a temporary escape from state prison. Discovered by William Steen in a prison art show, Clark found an enthusiastic reception in the wider world. After winning a prize in the \\"Texas Department of Corrections Art Show,\\" he was exhibited in \\"Living Folk\\" at Hirschl & Adler Folk Gallery in New York in 1990; \\"Passionate Visions of the American South,\\" New Orleans Museum of Art, 1993, and \\"Spirited Journeys: Self-Taught Texas Artists of the Twentieth Century,\\" 1997. Clark said his work comes to him naturally: \\"I sit down and, watch a football game or watch my soap operas every day. While I'm watching, this my hand be real busy. Every once in a while, I glance down, I don't know where it come from, but it's beautiful precise control.\\" Looking further into specific works from Clark, a well-known piece titled “I am The Day Star,” contains psychedelic patterns and shapes that compliment his dreamlike style. With patterns that hint towards his cultural roots and colors that accommodate dream-like visions, this work captures the uniqueness that separates prison art from any other. His artwork seems to capture the polarities in his life, from reality to fantasy and from the influences that come from the confines of a prison cell. Another work that embodies these traits is titled “The Magnificent Pretty Boy.” This piece, along with “I am The Day Star” captures mesmerizing patterns of exuberant creative fluidity. Prison Art Clark spent a majority of his life behind bars. In 1977, he was convicted of murder relating to a gambling confrontation. While serving time in prison, Clark found art to utilize his time behind bars. He would make art only when incarcerated, but his drawings would go far beyond the confined walls in his cell. “I have my own private galaxy out there, and it has nothing to do with you-all’s world\\" . Clark was heavily known to include his personal experiences and cultural roots into his works. For example, it was known for him to include his dreams and visions into his drawings. Prison art was a popular form of artistic expression in contemporary American prisons, and therefore, traditions are handed down cellmate to cellmate. The exposure to materials in the confines of prison are slim. Soap carving is a common form of art, along with the usage of wrappers and recycled paper. Micheal Harms was known nationwide for his soap carvings and extensive tiny carvings . For Clark, his drawing and creating would be done on anything he could find, including manilla envelopes, prison forms and the backs of letters. His art received great attention from a prison art show then was soon receiving special recognition from the public after attending the show. A few short years after being out of jail for his first offense, Clark was charged for possession of narcotics and was sentenced 30 years. After he was released on parole, in 1994, he opened a fast food stand called the Magnificent Burger, although he was arrested shortly after because of failure to report to his parole officer. He also practiced writing poetry alongside his drawing artworks which were often rare for the public eye and only addressed to important people in his life.

The centenary of her death was commemorated throughout the former Yugoslavia where she is often referred to simply as Miss Irby. Life (Adeline) Paulina Irby was born in 1831. Her father's home was at Boyland Hall in Morningthorpe. Her parents were Rear- Admiral Frederick Paul Irby and Frances Wright.Dorothy Anderson, 'Irby, (Adeline) Paulina (1831–1911)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 1 March 2013 Her mother, her father's second wife, came from Mapperley Hall near Nottingham. Her brother Colonel Howard Irby was a noted ornithologist. Irby set out with her Scottish companion Georgina Muir Mackenzie initially to visit spa towns in Austria- Hungary and Germany in 1857. In 1858 they were arrested as spies in the Carpathian mountains on the grounds that they had \\"pan-Slavistic tendencies\\". They did not stand trial, and neither of them were aware of the underlying issues, but they were both intrigued by the subject. They travelled in Albania and Serbia investigating the conditions and both became supporters of Serbia and the southern Slavs as they saw their conditions under the perceived poor government by the Ottoman rulers. They were particularly concerned by the plight of Serbian Orthodox women and girls who found they had poor access to positions and schooling. In 1862 they published Notes on the South Slavonic Countries in Austria and Turkey in Europe based on Mackenzie's lecture in Bath and Across the Carpathians but they did this anonymously. Irby and Mackenzie established an organisation to gather funds and Irby was in regular correspondence with Florence Nightingale who encouraged and supported Irby, encouraging her to get her facts right so that Nightingale could get their case published in The Times. Irby and Nightingales had met at the Deaconess's Institute of Kaiserswerth. Their requests for money were very successful and they opened a Christian school in Sarajevo staffed by German Protestant Deaconesses. Irby took the lead in managing this school in 1871 helped by Priscilla Johnson who herself came from a campaigning family. Irby was corresponding with her friend Florence Nightingale and Irby was considered as a companion for Nightingale's mother in 1875. However, in the same year Irby closed the Sarajevo school as the Christian population went into revolt. She followed the Bosnian refugees and distributed food to 3,000 people. By July 1876 she had returned to England and she reported on seven schools which they had organised. This was of especial interest given that the \\"Bulgarian Atrocities\\" and Lady Strangford was in the news. Irby was mentioned in Parliament and William Gladstone wrote an introduction to the second edition of her book. This book had been substantially expanded by Irby with four extra chapters on what is now Bosnia. By 1878 there were 21 schools educating 2,000 Christian children and supplying food and clothing in Dalmatia and Slavonia. In 1879 Irby was able to re-open the school supporting Christian children in Sarajevo. The school was credited with educating the next generation of teachers. The Austrians were worried by Irby and her pro-Slav sympathies, but by 1907 she was given a letter of thanks signed by 200 Bosnian notable people. When Irby died in Sarajevo, leaving all her money to aid education in Bosnia, there was mourning in Belgrade as well as Sarajevo. 15,000 people irrespective of gender or faith were said to have paid their respects in a funeral that Bosnia \\"had never saw\\". Irby had been in correspondence with Florence Nightingale for many years and Nightingale kept copies of the letters but Irby requested that Nightingale's supportive, but occasionally critical, letters be destroyed after her death. Legacy She was awarded Order of St. Sava and Order of the Cross of Takovo. A street in Sarajevo Mis Irbina ulica is named in her honour. Similarly, a street in Belgrade, within the municipality of Zvezdara, Ulica Mis Irbijeve carries her name. The street was renamed to Ulica Zage Malivuk during the communist period, after the Yugoslav Communist Party (KPJ) activist and World War II Partisan Zagorka \\"Zaga\\" Malivuk. In 2004, the street's original name after Paulina Irby was reinstated.Stari i novi nazivi ulica ;Opština Zvezdara For a number of years, an annual ceremony was held at her grave to mark the shot that initiated the First World War and there was belated commemorations of the centenary of her birth (in 1934) throughout Yugoslavia.

Dexter House, is a private house located at 8341 Island Lake Road in Dexter, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1958 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The house is unique in Michigan for its balance, large scale, and massive hexastyle portico. The structure is also significant as the dwelling of Judge Samuel W. Dexter, a pioneering Michigan resident and land baron who had a substantial impact on early development of Washtenaw County and other sections of the state. The house was later owned by Dexter's granddaughter Katherine Dexter McCormick, a pioneering research scientist, suffragist, and philanthropist. In its early days, Gordon Hall hosted at least two, and possibly three United States presidents, and it was almost certainly a stop along the Underground Railroad. Samuel William Dexter Judge Samuel W. Dexter, c. 1860 Samuel W. Dexter's earlier house on Huron Street in Dexter (demolished 1937) Samuel W. Dexter was born in Boston in 1792 to Samuel Dexter, a politician who served as a Congressman, Senator, and both Secretary of War and Secretary of the Treasury under President John Adams; and Catherine Gordon, daughter of William and Temperance Gordon of Boston. The younger Dexter attended Harvard University, where he graduated in 1812, and he received a law degree three years later. He moved to Athens, New York, in 1816 and married Amelia Augusta Prevost. The couple had two children: Samuel, born in 1817, and Augustine, born in 1820. However, both Amelia and Augustine died in 1822. In 1824, Dexter moved to Detroit with $80,000, and proceeded to purchase 926 acres of land in Michigan. On that land, Dexter founded Byron, Michigan, the county seat of Shiawassee County, and Saginaw, Michigan, the county seat of Saginaw County. He also purchased land in Webster and Scio Townships in Washtenaw County, on which he later founded the village of Dexter. On his Washtenaw County holdings, Dexter built a sawmill on Mill Creek, and a log cabin nearby. Dexter returned to Massachusetts in 1825, and there married his second wife, Susan Dunham. Dexter returned to Michigan in 1826, living in the log cabin while a frame house was built nearby on the riverbank, located on what is now Huron Street in the present-day village of Dexter. As the village grew, Dexter's house became the center of activity for the community. Dexter established a post office in the house, and it was used as a place of worship for a number of different denominations. In 1826, Dexter was appointed Chief Justice of Washtenaw County by Lewis Cass, a post he served in until 1833. In addition to his sawmill, he also built a grist mill and a boarding house. In 1829, he established the first newspaper in Washtenaw County, the Western Immigrant, published in Ann Arbor. He also ran for Congress in 1831, and served as a Regent of the University of Michigan in 1840. In 1827, a son was born to Dexter and his wife Susan; however, soon after both Susan Dexter and the infant died. In 1828, Dexter married his third wife, sixteen-year-old Millisent Bond, whose widowed mother had recently settled in Michigan after moving from Massachusetts. The couple had eight children: Mary (born 1830), Wirt (born 1831), Katherine (born 1833), Hannah (born 1834), Julia (born 1837), Charlotte (born 1839), Isabella (born 1841) and Marshall (born 1858). All of the children lived to adulthood. In 1830, Dexter platted a village on the land surrounding his house; he named it \\"Dexter\\" to honor his father. He also obtained land in other parts of Michigan; in addition to establishing Saginaw, Byron, and Dexter, he platted Ionia, Michigan, and by 1835 owned of land in Washtenaw County alone. Dexter was a vocal supporter of railroads (and, indeed, is generally credited as the first person to publicly call for the construction of a transcontinental railroad, in an editorial in 1832), and in 1837 deeded a wide portion of his land to the state for the purpose of constructing a railroad. The railroad was built in 1841, and passed very close to Dexter's Huron Street house. This encouraged him to build a larger country mansion on outside of Dexter, a house he called \\"Gordon Hall\\" in honor of his mother, Catherine Gordon Dexter. Gordon Hall history Millisent Dexter c. 1870 Basement plan: note trap door callout on left Dexter chose a site on a prominent hilltop to build his country estate. He hired architect Calvin T. Fillmore (brother of Millard Fillmore) to design his new country house. Fillmore had moved to Washtenaw County in 1837, and had a successful career as an architect and builder. Dexter himself also had some hand in the design. Overseeing the building was Fillmore's assistant Sylvester Newkirk, who later went on to become a successful contractor, and also to marry Fillmore's niece Viola Johnson. Construction on Gordon Hall began in 1841, and wasn't completed until 1843. The substantial construction time was due in great part to the difficulty in obtaining lumber, much of which had to be hauled in from Flint or Detroit. However, once construction was complete, the Dexters moved from their previous house on Huron Street into the new country house (the Huron Street house was demolished in 1937). The Dexters, as prominent citizens, entertained many important visitors, including US Presidents James K. Polk and James Buchanan. Although it is not certain, it is likely that a third president, Millard Fillmore, also visited Gordon Hall – it is known that Fillmore visited his brother Calvin, and it is likely the pair would have toured the house that Calvin designed. Samuel Dexter was a staunch abolitionist, and it is nearly certain that Gordon Hall was a stop on the Underground Railroad. There is some evidence that Millisent Dexter employed a string of Black servants, all of whom were recent arrivals to the village and none of whom stayed for any length of time. In oral histories, Samuel Dexter and his sons were identified as conductors on the Underground Railroad. More telling, it has been documented that Gordon Hall once contained a secret room in the basement, accessible through a trap door on the south porch and from concealed openings in crawlspaces under the other porches. Although the trap door was removed during remodeling and the \\"secret\\" room had doors cut to it, the passages to the crawl space remain in the house. Samuel Dexter lived in Gordon Hall until he died on January 6, 1863. Millisent Dexter and some of their children continued to live in the house. Millisent made some alterations to the structure, most significantly removing one of the wings and adding a four- story tower in its place in the 1870s. Samuel Dexter's business operations were passed to Wirt Dexter, his only son. Wirt sold off much of the surrounding land, so that by 1875 the estate was down to about 70 acres. On June 27, 1899, Millisent Dexter died. Her will specified that Gordon Hall was to be sold, with the proceeds of the sale being split among her daughters. In 1900, the house was sold to Thomas Birkett, a prominent local banker and miller. Birkett lived in the house for some time, but at some point moved out, leaving it vacant. By the time of his death in 1916, the structure was in very poor condition. After Birkett's death, the property was purchased by Dr. Charles G. Crumrine, a physician from Detroit whose health was failing and who wished to retire to the country. Crumrine moved into Gordon Hall in 1919, repairing the structure and adding a new roof. He ran the property for some time as a farm, but was soon overcome by illness and died in 1924. Crumrine willed the property to his son, Charles Jr. The younger Crumrine rented out portions of the house, but then allowed it to go vacant for many years, and again fall into disrepair. In 1934, the Historic American Buildings Survey project documented the building, taking photographs and making drawings of the exterior. In 1939, Katherine Dexter McCormick purchased the property. McCormick was the daughter of Judge Samuel Dexter's son Wirt, and had been born in Gordon Hall in 1875. She had graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1904 with a BS in Biology; the Institute's second woman graduate. She then married Stanley McCormick, the son of Cyrus McCormick. Katherine McCormick conducted research in biochemistry and schizophrenia, was instrumental in achieving the ratification of the 19th amendment allowing women to vote, and co-founded the League of Women Voters. At the time she purchased Gordon Hall, McCormick was living in California. She hired Emil Lorch, dean emeritus of the College or Architecture at the University of Michigan, to restore the house, thinking to turn it into a place that could be used by Dexter's women's clubs. Lorch spent eight years restoring and refurbishing the building, including the removal of the four- story tower built by Millisent Dexter and rebuilding the wing similar to the original. However, in 1950, before the rehabilitation was complete, McCormick gave the property to the University of Michigan, in part to help settle some of her own estate tax issues. By some reports, the gift contained the stipulation that the interior be converted to apartments for university faculty and staff. By other reports, the conversion was the University's idea and no one had informed McCormick. In any case, despite the controversial timing, contractors were swiftly employed, the interior was completely gutted, and the conversion was completed. One of the first occupants was Alexander Grant Ruthven, who moved into Gordon Hall after stepping down from the presidency of the University in 1951. The University continued to maintain the property until 2000, when it decided to sell it. In 2006, the Dexter Area Historical Society and Museum purchased the property, with the intent of making it a community resource. A small parcel of the grounds was sold in 2009, to United Methodist Retirement Community, Inc., who built a senior citizens' retirement community on the site; the sale reduced the size of the grounds to about 68 acres. As of 2011, the building was unoccupied, but was used occasionally for tours and functions. Description Front half- elevation The Judge Samuel W. Dexter House is a two-story rectangular Greek Revival post-and-beam frame structure, sitting on a stone and concrete foundation. The design is a classic \\"hen and chicks\\" configuration, with the main two-story structure, measuring by , flanked by a pair of 1-1/2 story wings, measuring by , connected on the rear corners. The exterior is clad in aluminum siding installed during the 1951 renovation, although the original clapboard siding is still underneath. The front facade features a gabled temple front, with an impressive hexastyle Doric portico along the front facade that extends the full height of the building. The main door is centered in the front portico, and is surrounded by sidelights and pilasters and topped with a transom. The front is five bays wide, with symmetrical window placement. The side elevations of the house have small single-story porches, supported by three Doric columns. A fourth porch spans the rear of the house, connecting the additions, with a rear door similar in detail to the front opening onto the porch. Two more doors access the side porches. A set of three doors opens onto the deck formed by the roof of the rear porch. The windows in the house are double-hung, with six-over-six lights, many of which are original to the house. The roof is covered with asphalt shingling, and a set of low-sloped dormers project to the rear. There is approximately 2,500 square feet on each of the first and second floors, and somewhat less in the unfinished attic and basement. The original interior configuration had a grand central hall and stairwell, with four large rooms at each corner, all with fireplaces. On the first floor these were identified as a dining room, a parlor (or library), and two drawing rooms. On the second floor, these were four bed chambers; an additional sewing room spanned the area across the front of the house. Additional rooms, including a first-floor kitchen, were in the side wings. In all, the original house had 22 rooms, nine fireplaces, and 55 windows. The ceilings rise on the first floor and on the second. However, the 1951 renovation nearly entirely eliminated the historical integrity of the interior of the structure, with all interior trim and nearly all the walls removed. The house was converted into four apartments, with two stairways for accessing the second-floor apartments and the attic space. All four apartments are nearly identical, with two bedrooms, a small bathroom, a kitchen, and a combined living room/dining area. Although the interior has lost its historic fabric, the main structure is substantially intact, and the large-scale majestic features that make the structure architecturally significant still exist. Gordon Hall has often been likened to Jefferson's Monticello, in part due to its grand execution and in part due to its situation on a hilltop and the surrounding, and still extant, sweeping view.

A daughter of the Victorian reformer and statesman Richard Cobden, she was an early proponent of women's rights, and in 1889 was one of two women elected to the inaugural London County Council. Her election was controversial; legal challenges to her eligibility hampered and eventually prevented her from serving as a councillor. From her youth Jane Cobden, together with her sisters, sought to protect and develop the legacy of her father. She remained committed throughout her life to the \\"Cobdenite\\" issues of land reform, peace, and social justice, and was a consistent advocate for Irish independence from Britain. The battle for women's suffrage on equal terms with men, to which she made her first commitment in 1875, was her most enduring cause. Although she was sympathetic and supportive of those, including her sister Anne Cobden-Sanderson, who chose to campaign using militant, illegal methods, she kept her own activities within the law. She stayed in the Liberal Party, despite her profound disagreement with its stance on the suffrage issue. After her marriage to the publisher Thomas Fisher Unwin in 1892, Jane Cobden extended her range of interests into the international field, in particular advancing the rights of the indigenous populations within colonial territories. As a convinced anti-imperialist she opposed the Boer War of 1899–1902, and after the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910 she attacked its introduction of segregationist policies. In the years prior to the First World War she opposed Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform crusade on the grounds of her father's free trade principles, and was prominent in the Liberal Party's revival of the land reform issue. In the 1920s she largely retired from public life, and in 1928 presented the old Cobden family residence, Dunford House, to the Cobden Memorial Association as a conference and education centre dedicated to the issues and causes that had defined Cobdenism. Early years=Family background and childhood= Jane Cobden was born on 28 April 1851 in Westbourne Terrace, London. She was the third daughter and fourth child of Richard Cobden, who at the time of her birth was a Radical MP for the West Riding. With John Bright he had co-founded the Anti- Corn Law League which in the 1840s had spearheaded the successful campaign for the abolition of the Corn Laws. Jane's mother was Catherine Anne, née Williams, the daughter of a timber merchant from Machynlleth in Wales; the older Cobden children were Richard (\\"Dick\\"), born 1841; Kate, born 1844; and Ellen, born 1848. Two further daughters followed Jane: Anne, born 1853, and Lucy, born 1861. In the 1830s Richard had handed control of his prosperous calico-printing business to his brothers, so that he could concentrate on public service.Morley, pp. 117–18 By 1849 the business was failing and Richard was close to financial ruin. He was saved from bankruptcy by a public subscription which not only settled his debts but also enabled him to acquire the farmhouse in which he had been born in 1804, at Dunford, near Heyshott in Sussex. He rebuilt the property as a large villa, Dunford House, which became Jane Cobden's childhood home from the beginning of 1854.Rogers, pp. 84–91 In April 1856 Dick, who was at school at Weinheim in Germany, died there after a short illness.Rogers, pp. 115–16 The news was a devastating shock to the family, and caused Richard's temporary withdrawal from public life. This hiatus was prolonged when, in 1857, he lost his parliamentary seat.Morley, p. 657 He returned to the House of Commons in May 1859, as Liberal MP for Rochdale.Morley, p. 689 Because of his many absences from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: \\"Do not keep the money ... as you have now made up your minds to give it to poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, and tell me all about it\\".Richardson, pp. 235–36 =Sisterhood= Richard Cobden died after a severe bronchial attack on 2 April 1865, a few weeks before Jane's 14th birthday.Rogers, pp. 175–76 There followed a time of domestic uncertainty and financial worry, eventually resolved by a pension from the government of £1,500 a year, and the establishment of a \\"Cobden Tribute Fund\\" by his friends and followers.Rogers, p. 178 After their father's death Jane and Anne attended Warrington Lodge school in Maida Hill but, following a disagreement the nature of which is unclear, both were removed from the school—\\"thrown on my hands\\", their mother complained.Rogers, p. 179 In this difficult time, Catherine did not withdraw into seclusion; in 1866 she supervised the re-publication of her husband's Political Writings, and in the same year became one of the 1,499 signatories to the \\"Ladies Petition\\", an event that the historian Sophia Van Wingerden marks as the beginning of the organised women's suffrage movement.Van Wingerden, pp. 1–2 In 1869 Dunford House was let. Catherine and her four younger daughters moved to a house in South Kensington—the eldest, Kate, had married in 1866. The ménage proved unsatisfactory; Ellen, Jane and Anne were now displaying considerable independence of spirit, and differences of opinion arose between mother and daughters. Catherine moved out, taking the youngest daughter Lucy, and went to Wales where she lived until her death in 1877.Rogers, pp. 180–81 In South Kensington, Ellen, Jane and Anne, often joined by Kate, established a sisterhood determined both to preserve Richard Cobden's memory and works and to uphold his principles and radical causes by actions of their own. Together they stopped publication of a memoir of their father, sponsored by his former colleagues and compiled by a family friend, Julie Salis Schwabe. This caused some offence; Schwabe had given the family financial and emotional support after Richard's death.Richardson, p. 231 However, Jane in particular wanted a more substantial memorial, and secured the services of John Morley, whose biography of Richard Cobden was published in 1881. During these years Jane often travelled abroad. In London, she and her sisters extended their range of acquaintances into literary and artistic circles; among their new friends were the writer George MacDonald and the Pre-Raphaelites William and Jane Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. Ellen later married the painter Walter Sickert. Jane developed an interest in the question of women's suffrage after attending a conference in London, in 1871. In 1875 she made a specific commitment to this cause, although she did not became active in the movement for several years. In the meantime, in 1879, she helped to found the Cobden Club in Heyshott, close to her father's birthplace. Early campaigns=Women's suffrage= From the late 1870s the Cobden sisters began to follow different pathways. Anne married Thomas Sanderson in 1882; inspired by her friendships within the Morris circle, her interests turned towards arts and crafts and eventually to socialism. After her marriage to Sickert failed, Ellen became a novelist. Jane became an active Liberal, on the radical wing of the party. In about 1879 she became a member of the National Society for Women's Suffrage, which had been founded in 1867 in the wake of the 1866 \\"Ladies Petition\\".Rosen, pp. 6–7 Jane joined the National Society's finance committee, and by 1880 was serving as its treasurer. That year she was a speaker at a \\"Grand Demonstration\\" at St James's Hall, London, and in the following year addressed a similar meeting in Bradford. In 1883 she attended a conference in Leeds, jointly organised by the National Liberal Federation and the National Reform Union, where she supported a motion proposed by Henry William Crosskey and seconded by Walter McLaren (John Bright's nephew), to extend the vote in parliamentary elections to certain women—those who, \\"possessing the qualifications that entitle men to vote, have now the right of voting in all matters of local government\\".Crawford, p. 154 The National Society's general stance was cautious; it avoided close identification with political parties, and for this reason would not accept affiliation from branches of the Women's Liberal Federation. This, and its policy of excluding married women from any extension of the franchise, led to a split in 1888, with the formation of a breakaway \\"Central National Society\\" (CNS). Jane joined the executive committee of the new body, which encouraged the affiliation of Women's Liberal Associations and hoped that a future Liberal government would grant women's enfranchisement. However, the more radical members of the CNS felt that its commitment to votes for married women was too half-hearted.Crawford, pp. 103–04 In 1889 this group, which included Jane Cobden and Emmeline Pankhurst, formed the Women's Franchise League (WFL) with a specific policy of seeking votes for women on the same basis as for men, and the eligibility of women for all offices.Rosen, p. 17 =Ireland= In 1848 Richard Cobden had written: \\"Almost every crime and outrage in Ireland is connected with the occupation or ownership of land ... if I had the power, I would always make the proprietors of the soil resident, by breaking up the large properties. In other words, I would give Ireland to the Irish\\".Letter 28 October 1848, quoted in Morley, p. 493 Nevertheless, his views were held in the context of Unionism; he had condemned the 1848 \\"Young Ireland\\" rebellion as an act of insanity.Letter 21 July 1848, quoted in Morley, p. 488 Jane adopted her father's standpoint on Irish land reform, yet embraced the cause of Irish home rule—on which she lectured regularly—and was a strong supporter of the Land League. After visiting Ireland with the Women's Mission to Ireland in 1887, she subsequently used the pages of the English press to expose the mistreatment of evicted tenants. In a letter to The Times, Jane and her associates cited one particular case—that of the Ryan family of Cloughbready in County Tipperary—to illustrate the British government's harshness towards even the most vulnerable of individuals. Jane sent money and food to alleviate the Ryan family's distress.Richardson, pp. 238–39 Jane was in contact with Irish Land League leaders, including John Dillon and William O'Brien, and lobbied for the release of the latter after his imprisonment under the Coercion Act of 1881. She and her sisters supported the Irish Plan of Campaign, a scheme whereby tenants acted collectively to secure fair rents from their landlords. This plan was eventually denounced by the Roman Catholic Church as contrary to natural justice and Christian charity, although some priests supported it. The attachment of Jane and her sisters to the rebellious factions in Ireland strained relations between the sisters and many of their father's former Liberal Unionist colleagues, but won approval from Thomas Bayley Potter, who had succeeded Richard Cobden as MP for Rochdale. In October 1887 he wrote to Jane: \\"You are true to the living and just instincts of your father ... You know your father's heart better than John Bright does\\". London County Council election 1889 A Jane Cobden campaign poster, January 1889 Under the Municipal Corporations Act of 1882 some women were qualified to vote in municipal elections, but were excluded from serving as councillors. However, the Local Government Act of 1888, which created county councils, was interpreted by some as allowing women's election to these new bodies.Hollis, pp. 306–07 On 17 November 1888 a group of Liberal women decided to test the legal position. They formed the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors (SPRWCC), established an election fund of £400 and selected two women—Jane Cobden and Margaret Sandhurst— as Liberal candidates for the newly created London County Council. Cobden was adopted by the party's Bow and Bromley division, and Sandhurst by Brixton. Despite objections from the Conservatives, the women's nominations were accepted by the local returning officers.Hollis, p. 309 Cobden's campaign in Bow and Bromley was organised with considerable enthusiasm and efficiency by the 29-year-old George Lansbury, then a Radical Liberal, later a socialist and eventually leader of the Labour Party.Shepherd, pp. 21–23 Both Cobden and Sandhurst were victorious in the elections on 19 January 1889; they were joined by Emma Cons, whom the Progressive majority on the council selected to serve as an alderman.Hollis, pp. 310–11 The women took their places on the inaugural council, and each accepted a range of committee assignments. Almost immediately, however, Sandhurst's defeated Conservative opponent, Beresford Hope, lodged a legal challenge against her election. When this was heard on 18 March, the judges ruled Sandhurst disqualified under the provisions of the 1882 Act. Her appeal was dismissed, and Beresford Hope was installed in her place. Cobden faced no such challenge, since her runner-up was a fellow- Liberal who had promised to support her. Even so, her position on the council remained precarious, particularly after an attempt in parliament to legalise women's rights to serve as county councillors gained little support. A provision of the prevailing election law provided that anyone elected, even improperly, could not be challenged after twelve months, so on legal advice Cobden refrained from attending council or committee meetings until February 1890. When the statutory twelve months elapsed without challenge, she resumed her full range of duties.Hollis, pp. 311–15 Although Cobden was now protected from challenge, the Conservative member for Westminster, Sir Walter De Souza, instituted fresh court proceedings against both Cobden and Cons. He argued that since they had been elected or selected unlawfully, their votes in the council had likewise been unlawful, making them liable to heavy financial penalties. In court the judge ruled against both women, though on appeal in April 1891 the penalties were reduced from an original £250 to a nominal £5. Cobden was urged by Lansbury and others not to pay even this token, but to go to prison; she declined this course of action. After a further parliamentary attempt to resolve the situation failed, she sat out the remaining months of her term as a councillor in silence, neither speaking nor voting, and did not seek re-election in the 1892 county elections. Women did not receive the right to sit on county councils until 1907, with the passage of the Qualification of Women Act.Hollis, p. 392Wilson, p. 48 In his account of the 1888–89 election, the historian Jonathan Schneer marks the campaign as a step in what he terms \\"working-class disenchantment with official Liberalism\\", citing in particular Lansbury's departure from the Liberal Party in 1892. Schneer also remarks that this \\"pioneering political venture of British feminism ... provides at once an anticipation of, and a direct contrast to, the militant suffragism of the Edwardian era\\".Shepherd, p. 24 Marriage, wider interests In 1892, at the age of 41, Cobden married Thomas Fisher Unwin, an avant-garde publisher whose list included works by Henrik Ibsen, Friedrich Nietzsche, H.G. Wells and the young Somerset Maugham. Unwin's involvement in a range of world and humanitarian causes led Cobden—who adopted the surname \\"Cobden Unwin\\"—to extend her interests to international peace and justice, reform in the Congo, and more generally the rights of aboriginal peoples. She and Unwin opposed the Boer War (1899–1902); both were founder-members of the pro-Boer South African Conciliation Committee, Cobden acting as the committee's secretary. The couple settled in South Kensington, from where Cobden continued to pursue her own causes. In 1893, with Laura Ormiston Chant, she represented the WFL in Chicago at the World Congress of Representative Women.Crawford, p. 105 At home, she assisted women candidates in the 1894 Kensington \\"vestry\\" elections.Hollis, p. 343 In 1900 she accepted the presidency of the Brighton Women's Liberal Association,Crawford, p. 293 and in the same year wrote an extended tract, The Recent Development of Violence in our Midst, published by the Stop-the-War Committee. Edwardian campaigner=Votes for women, 1903–14= Members of the Women's Social and Political Union campaigning for women's suffrage in London, around 1910 Although Cobden's views were more progressive than those of the Liberal Party's mainstream, she stayed a member of the party, believing that it remained the best political vehicle whereby her causes could be advanced. Other suffragists, including Anne Cobden Sanderson, took a different view, and aligned themselves with socialist movements.Richardson, p. 242 When the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) began its militant campaign in 1905, Cobden refrained from participation in illegal actions, although she spoke out for her sister when Anne became one of the first suffragists to be sent to prison, after a demonstration outside Parliament in October 1906. On Anne's release a month later, Cobden and her husband attended a celebration banquet at the Savoy Hotel, together with other WSPU prisoners. Cobden moved closer to the militant wing in 1907 when she endorsed the WSPU's new magazine, Votes for Women. That year she hosted an \\"At Home\\" meeting at which the WSPU leader Christabel Pankhurst was the principal speaker. The WSPU was split when members who objected to the Pankhurst family's authoritarian leadership formed themselves into the Women's Freedom League;Pugh, p. 144 and pp. 163–67 Cobden did not join Anne in the breakaway movement, although she supported its associated body, the Women's Tax Resistance League. In 1911 Cobden was responsible for the Indian women's delegation in the Women's Coronation Procession, a London demonstration organised by suffrage associations from Britain and the Empire. The procession marched on 17 June 1911, a few days before King George V's coronation. During 1910–12 several Conciliation Bills extending the parliamentary vote to a limited number of propertied women, were debated in the House of Commons. When the third of these was under discussion, Cobden sought the help of the Irish Parliamentary Party by reminding them of the support women had given to Ireland during the Land League agitation: \\"In the name of those 40,000 Englishwomen we urge you to support at every division this Bill by your presence and your vote\\". The bill was finally abandoned when the Liberal prime minister, H. H. Asquith, replaced it with a bill extending the male suffrage. In protest against the Liberal government's suffrage policies and its harsh treatment of militants, Cobden resigned her honorary presidency of the Women's Liberal Association in Rochdale, her father's last constituency. =Social, political and humanitarian activities= Jane Cobden Although the cause of women's suffrage remained her principal concern, at least until the First World War, Cobden was active in other campaigns. In 1903 she defended the principles of free trade, as expressed by her father, against Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform crusade. Chamberlain had called for a policy of Imperial Preference, and the imposition of tariffs against countries opposed to Britain's imperial interests. To a meeting in Manchester, Cobden expressed confidence that \\"Manchester ... will tell Mr Chamberlain that it is still loyal to our old flag: free trade, peace and goodwill among nations\\".Richardson, p. 232 In 1904, Richard Cobden's centenary year, she published The Hungry Forties, described by Anthony Howe in a biographical article as \\"an evocative and brilliantly successful tract\\". It was one of several free trade books and pamphlets issued by the Fisher Unwin press which, together with celebratory centenary events, helped to define free trade as a major progressive cause of the Edwardian era. The Cobdenite cause of land reform was revived in the 1900s as a major Liberal policy, helped in 1913 by the publication of Jane Cobden's book The Land Hunger: Life under Monopoly. The dedication read: \\"To the memory of Richard Cobden who loved his native land, these pages are dedicated by his daughter, in the hope that his desire—'Free Trade in Land'—may be fulfilled\\". Cobden did not confine her interests to domestic affairs. From 1906, along with Helen Bright Clark, she was an active member of the Aborigines' Protection Society,Crawford, p. 114 an organisation concerned with the rights of indigenous peoples under colonial rule; the society merged with the Anti-Slavery Society in 1909. In 1907 she lobbied the prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, on behalf of the Friends of Russian Freedom, seeking his support for amendments to the Hague Convention, then in session in Geneva Her efforts for the poorest in society encompassed appeals on behalf of the families of striking workers in London and Dublin during the labour unrest of 1913–14, and of starving women and children in Tripoli. She also found time to act as secretary to the memorial fund for Emma Cons, after the latter's death in 1912. Late campaigns During the war years 1914–18, with the issue of women's suffrage quiescent, Cobden became increasingly involved in South African affairs. She supported Solomon Plaatje's campaign against the segregationist Natives' Land Act of 1913, a stance that led, in 1917, to her removal from the committee of the Anti-Slavery Society. The Society's line was to support the Botha government's land reform policy; Cobden denounced Sir John Harris, the Society's parliamentary representative, for being a false friend to the native people by secretly working against them. Cobden maintained her commitment to the cause of Irish freedom, and offered personal help to victims of the Black and Tans during the Irish War of Independence, 1919–21. In 1920 Cobden gave Dunford House to the London School of Economics (LSE), of which she had become a governor. According to Beatrice Webb, co-founder of the School, she soon regretted the gift; Webb wrote in her diary on 2 May 1923: \\"The poor lady ... makes fretful complaints if a single bush is cut down or a stone shifted, whilst she vehemently resents the high spirits of the students ... not to mention the opinions of some of the lecturers\\". Later in 1923 LSE returned the house to Cobden; in 1928 she donated it to the Cobden Memorial Association. With the help of the writer and journalist Francis Wrigley Hirst and others, the house became a conference and education centre for pursuing the traditional Cobdenite causes of free trade, peace and goodwill. Final years, death and legacy After 1928, Jane Cobden's chief occupation was the organisation of her father's papers, some of which she placed in the British Museum. Others were eventually collected, with other Cobden family documents, by the West Sussex County Council Record Office at Chichester. In old age she lived quietly at Oatscroft, her home near Dunford House, and following her husband's death in 1935 made few interventions in public life. During the 1930s, under Hirst's direction, Dunford House continued to preach what Howe describes as \\"the pure milk of the Cobdenian faith\\": the conviction that in Britain and in continental Europe, peace and prosperity would develop from individual ownership of the soil. Jane Cobden died, aged 96, on 7 July 1947, at Whitehanger Nursing Home in Fernhurst, Surrey. In the years following her death her papers were collected and deposited as part of the family archive in Chichester. In 1952 Dunford House was transferred to the YMCA, although its general educational functions and mission remained unchanged. The house contains numerous memorabilia of the Cobden family. Howe depicts Jane Cobden as a formidable personality, known by her husband's publishing colleagues as \\"The Jane\\", who took a keen and even intrusive interest in the work of the publishing house. She was, Howe says, \\"a woman of sentiment and enthusiasm who took up (and sometimes speedily dropped) causes with a fire which brooked no opposition\\". In an essay on the Cobden sisterhood, the feminist historian Sarah Richardson remarks on the different paths chosen by the sisters by which to take their father's legacy forward: \\"Jane's activities showed that it was still possible to follow a radical agenda within the aegis of Liberalism\\". Richardson indicates that the main collective achievement of Jane and her sisters was to ensure that the Cobden name, with its radical and progressive associations, survived well into the 20th century. \\"In doing so\\", Richardson concludes, \\"they proved themselves worthy successors to their father, guaranteeing that his contribution was not only sustained, but remodelled for a new age\\".Richardson, p. 246 Notes and references Notes Citations Sources   (First published by Chapman and Hall, London 1881)     * External links * University of Bristol Library Special Collections British women's rights activists English feminists English suffragists 1851 births 1947 deaths People from Paddington Liberal Party (UK) politicians ","title":"Jane Cobden"},{"id":"38677539","text":"Celeste Anderson (also known as BiiTTERSWEET) is a Filipino CanadianNuval, Alvin-Christian (February 2013). \\"Pro Gamer Celeste Anderson Competing to be King of the Nerds\\", BakitWhy.com; accessed April 25, 2018.Tilley, Steve (January 22, 2013). \\"Contestants battle for nerd supremacy on ‘King of the Nerds’\\", Toronto Sun; accessed April 25, 2018. competitive gamer and reality television personality, known for being the winner of the first season of the TBS reality show King of the Nerds\\"King of the Nerds Contestants\\" , TBS; retrieved March 2, 2013. for which she was awarded $100,000.

She responded to discrimination by fighting for the rights of people who were oppressed. She was active in labor organizing and Communist politics, and she insisted that women could travel and write professionally just as men could. She founded the newspaper that became the Minneapolis Labor Review, penned columns under feminine pseudonyms, and wrote poetry, plays, and fiction that addressed themes of injustice. Early life and education Irene Levine was born in Duluth, Minnesota on April 18, 1908. Her mother, Eva Zlatkovski Levine, was a Jewish immigrant from a Ukrainian shtetl, or small city Pereiaslav. Her father, Maurice Levine, was the son of Jewish immigrants from the same shtetl. The Levines lived near a large extended family and community from Peryaslov. Irene Levine Paull's radical politics were formed as a young child. When she began attending public school, gentile students called her anti-Semitic slurs. This experience, she often said, made her identify with the downtrodden. A few years later, a mob in Duluth murdered three African-American men in the 1920 Duluth lynchings. Around the same time, Levine heard about a Jewish man in another state who was lynched under similar conditions. These events made her determined to fight injustice. In 1925, Levine enrolled in The College of St. Scholastica in Duluth. She wanted to become a writer, and her parents wanted her to assimilate into the middle class. But Levine longed to ride the rails and seek out adventures like male writers did. She dropped out of college, moved to Chicago, and cast her lot with the poor. Labor activism and journalism In Chicago, Levine sharply disagreed with other middle class women who worked with the poor. Women like Jane Addams were social workers and reformists. Levine felt that they were policing the poor; she preferred to fight for their economic rights. Levine returned to Duluth in 1929 and married lawyer Henry Paull. Henry Paull had first proposed when Levine was sixteen, but she said no. After traveling and seeing more of the world, she finally agreed to marry him. Henry shared Irene's radical politics, and they worked together on political campaigns. In 1937, during the timber worker strike in northern Minnesota, Irene Paull and her cousin Sam Davis founded a newspaper called The Timber Worker. This newspaper later became Midwest Labor, the official regional newspaper of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), a large labor union. Paull wrote regular columns for the paper, often signed \\"Calamity Jane\\" or \\"Lumberjack Sue.\\" She used gender strategically in these columns. Sometimes she emphasized the need for women to keep house and have children; other times she wrote with a feistier tone, calling herself a \\"dangerous woman\\" and saying that she wanted to give union-bashers a black eye. She continued writing in the late 1930s and 1940s. She focused on topics like workers' rights, the Spanish Civil War, fascism, and racism in the United States. When folk singers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger visited Duluth, they stayed with Irene and Henry. In 1941, a collection of Irene's writing, We're the People, was published. Later life In 1947, Henry Paull had a heart attack and died suddenly. The next year, Paull moved to Minneapolis with her two children, Bonnie and Michael. The 1950s were a difficult time for Paull. Under the leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy, Communists and those suspected of being Communists faced social and political persecution. Jewish men and women were treated with extra suspicion, and Paull lived in fear that her children would be taken away from her. She worked on the support committee of two Jewish Communists, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, and she was devastated when they were executed in 1953. Paull moved to San Francisco after the Rosenberg executions. Her experience with anti- Semitism during the McCarthy Era made her reconnect with her Jewish heritage, and she began writing for magazines like Jewish Currents. In 1962, she was forced to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, another Congressional effort to attack radicals. She made a brief statement only to say that she would not respond to their harassment and ridicule. Paull remained an activist until her death, supporting the Civil Rights Movement and opposing the Vietnam War. She died in 1981.

Its mainstage season and children's shows occur during the summer, but the Hangar, and other organizations, utilize the space year-round for special events. The tenets of the Hangar's mission statement are to enrich, enlighten, educate and entertain.The Hangar Theatre. The Hangar Theatre, 2011. Web. 1 Mar. 2013..  History  The initial renovation of a municipal airport hangar into a theatre by Bill Carpenter, the Ithaca Youth Theatre, and Ithaca Fire Department was completed in 1969. Bill Carpenter was hired as the first director by the Chairman of the Ithaca Festival, Tom Niederkorn, and he worked for the Board of Directors of the festival for two years. The theatre was initially called the Hangar Playfair Theatre. It continued to be renovated thanks to a grant from Nelson Rockefeller and the joint efforts of the Ithaca Repertory Theatre, Cornell University, Ithaca College, and the City of Ithaca in 1975. In 1986, the Hangar received another grant from the New York State Natural Heritage Trust to build an adjacent set and costume shop. The Hangar’s capital campaign in 1995 raised more than $270,000 for additional improvements to the facility. From 1982-1996, under the artistic leadership of Robert Moss from New York’s Playwrights Horizons, the Hangar achieved national recognition as a professional regional theatre that produced plays and served as a learning environment for young theatre professionals. In 1988, the Hangar’s directing internship program expanded when the Drama League Project began sending emerging directors to the Hangar to direct plays in The Wedge, and in 1989 the Hangar’s Lab Company was formed. Mark Ramont served as artistic director from 1997-2000 during a period of creative growth for the Hangar. At the same time, under Education Director Lisa Bushlow from 1991-2000, the Hangar became recognized throughout New York State and across the country for its comprehensive, year-round theatre education programs. Today, the Hangar brings a range of theatre experiences to students across New York State, with the School Tour and Artists-in-the-Schools programs. Throughout the summer, KIDDSTUFF performances and the Next Generation School of Theatre reach thousands of young people. The Hangar currently serves approximately 60,000 adults and children annually. In 2000, the Board appointed Lisa as the Hangar’s first executive director, at which time she recommended Kevin Moriarty as the artistic director. Under their leadership the Hangar added a New Play Festival in 2001, the Hangar tent and Starlight Café in 2002, and expanded artistic and educational programming, including the commissioning of new plays. Robert Moss returned as Interim Artistic Director for summer 2008; Peter Flynn was named Artistic Director in August, 2008. Josh Friedman, the serving Managing Director, assumed the role in 2012. During 2012, Stephanie Yankwitt served as the Acting Artistic Director through the end of the Mainstage season. Jen Waldman assumed the role of Artistic Director in 2013.History of the Hangar.

Sybilla Righton Masters (c. 1676 – 23 August 1720)Blashfield JF Women Inventors, Volume 4 Capstone, 1996 was an American inventor. Masters was the first person residing in the American colonies to be given an English patent, and possibly the first known female Caucasian machinery inventor in America. Masters was given a patent for a corn mill in 1715 in her husband's name, as women were not allowed to have their own patents.Samuel C. Inventors and Inventions in Colonial America. The Rosen Publishing Group, 2003 She also patented a process for making hats.  Early life  Not much is known of Masters' early life. It is possible that she was born in Bermuda as her father had emigrated from there in 1687. It is believed that she was born around 1676, and in 1687 she and her six sisters emigrated from Bermuda to Burlington Township, New Jersey (along the Delaware River) with her Quaker parents Sarah and William Righton. Sybilla Righton first showed up in the colonial records in 1692 when she testified as a witness for her father in the New Jersey courts. Sometime between 1693 and 1696, Sybilla married Thomas Masters a prosperous Quaker merchant and landowner. They had four children Mary, Sarah, Thomas and William.  Journey to London  On June 24, 1712, Masters left her family and headed to London to pursue patents for her invention ideas. In 1712, some American colonies were issuing patents, but Pennsylvania was not among them. On November 25, 1715, the patent was granted by King George I of Great Britain in her husband's name for the process of \\"Cleaning and Curing The Indian Corn Growing in the several Colonies of America,\\" shown right. If not for her husband Thomas Masters, Sybilla Masters' name, as so many women inventors before and after her, would have been lost to history. Thomas Masters stated in the patent submission that it was her idea and when the patent was issued, King George I stated publicly that it was her idea. Masters received her second patent, again under her husband's name, for a method of weaving straw and palmetto leaves into hats and bonnets. She opened a shop in London that used this process and sold many popular hats and bonnets. Masters returned home to Pennsylvania on May 25, 1716.  Invention details Masters' first patent was awarded for a new method of the curing and preparation of cornmeal used a stamping process instead of grinding. The machine consisted of a long wooden cylinder with projections on each side which caused a series of heavy pestles to drop onto mortars filled with corn kernels. This invention was powered by horses or water wheels. It produced a product Masters named, \\"Tuscarora Rice\\" which was falsely advertised and sold as a cure for tuberculosis. While the product did not catch on in England, it became a staple of the southeastern diet and is today known as grits. The history of Masters and Tuscarora Rice was first described in 1844 by John Fanning Watson.Young, James Harvey. (2015 edition). The Toadstool Millionaires: A Social History of Patent Medicines in America before Federal Regulation. Princeton University Press. p. 19.

University of Illinois Press Performance history Smyth turned to composing opera on the advice of conductor Hermann Levi, who praised her aptitude for dramatic composition when she showed him her Mass in D in Munich. The idea of adapting a play by Alfred de Musset came from her friend Empress Eugénie. From 1894, Smyth made frequent trips around Europe trying to arrange a premiere for Fantasio. She received a string of rejections, but conductor Felix Mottl at Karlsruhe became interested. It was eventually staged at Weimar thanks to support from Mottl, who wrote to the Weimar conductor Bernhard Stavenhagen, and from Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Baroness Olga Meyendorff. However, the reviews were poor. In 1901 Mottl conducted it at Karlsruhe, but it was not revived again. Smyth later acknowledged that the libretto was weak and out of kilter with the tempestuous music, but thought that the experience had been valuable for her subsequent operatic career.

The search was designed to identify proteins which contained a sequence of amino acids called a voltage sensor, because this sequence of amino acids confers voltage sensitivity to voltage- gated ion channels. Although the initial genomic analysis was primarily concerned with the evolution of voltage-gated ion channels, one of the results of the work was the discovery of the VSP protein in sea squirt, termed Ci-VSP. The homologues to Ci-VSP in mammals are called Transmembrane phosphatases with tensin homology, or TPTEs. TPTE (now also called hVSP2) and the closely related TPIP (also called TPTE2 or hVSP1) were identified before the discovery of Ci-VSP, however no voltage-dependent activity was described in the initial reports of these proteins. Subsequently, computational methods were used to suggest that these proteins may be voltage sensitive, however Ci-VSP is still widely regarded as the first-identified VSP. Species and tissue distribution VSPs are found across animals and choanoflagellates, though lost from nematodes and insects. Humans contain two members, TPTE and TPTE2, which result from a primate-specific duplication . Most reports indicate that VSPs are found primarily in reproductive tissue, especially the testis. Other VSPs discovered include: Dr-VSP (zebrafish Danio rerio, 2008), Gg-VSP (chicken Gallus gallus domesticus, 2014), Xl-VSP1, Xl-VSP2, and Xt-VSP (frogs: X. laevis and X. tropicalis, 2011), TPTE (mouse), etc. Following the discovery of Ci-VSP, the nomenclature used for naming these proteins consists of two letters corresponding to the initials of the species name, followed by the acronym VSP. For the human VSPs, it has been suggested the adoption of the names Hs-VSP1 and Hs-VSP2 when referring to TPIP and TPTE, respectively. Structure and Function VSPs are made up of two protein domains: a voltage sensor domain, and a phosphatase domain coupled to a lipid-binding C2 domain. =The voltage sensor= A cartoon depicting movement of the S4 segment of a voltage sensor in response to depolarization. The voltage sensor domain contains four transmembrane helices, named S1 through S4. The S4 transmembrane helix contains a number of positively charged arginine and lysine amino acid residues. Voltage sensitivity in VSPs is generated primarily by these charges in the S4, in much the same way that voltage-gated ion channels are gated by voltage. When positive charge builds up on one side of a membrane containing such voltage sensors, it generates an electric force pressing the S4 in the opposite direction. Changes in membrane potential therefore move the S4 back and forth through the membrane, allowing the voltage sensor to act like a switch. Activation of the voltage sensor occurs at depolarized potentials, i.e.: when the membrane collects more positive charge on the inner leaflet. Conversely, deactivation of the voltage sensor takes place at hyperpolarized potentials, when the membrane collects more negative charge on the inner leaflet. Activation of the voltage sensor increases the activity of the phosphatase domain, while deactivation of the voltage sensor decreases phosphatase activity. =The phosphatase= The phosphatase domain in VSPs is highly homologous to the tumor suppressor PTEN, and acts to remove phosphate groups from phospholipids in the membrane containing the VSP. Phospholipids such as inositol phosphates are signaling molecules which exert different effects depending on the pattern in which they are phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. Therefore, the action of VSPs is to indirectly regulate processes dependent on phospholipids. The main substrate that has been characterized so far for VSPs (including hVSP1 but not hVSP2/TPTE, which shows no phosphatase activity) is phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate, which VSPs dephosphorylate at the 5' position. However, VSP activity has been reported against other phosphoinositides as well, including phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, which is also dephosphorylated at the 5' position. Activity against the 3-phosphate of PI(3,4)P2 has also been demonstrated; this activity seems to become apparent at high membrane potentials, at lower potentials the 5'-phosphatase activity is predominant. =X-Ray crystal structures= Chimera using the Ci-VSP PDB structures 3V0D, 3V0F, 4G7V, and 4G80. The catalytic domain is shown in pink, and the voltage sensing domain is in blue. The red residues are the arginines in S4, and the blue residue shows the glutamate in the proposed gating loop, regulating access to the catalytic cysteine (shown in orange). A part of the missing region between the two domains was modeled using the CPHmodels 3.2 server (shown in grey). X-ray crystallography has been used to generate high- resolution images of the two domains of Ci-VSP, separate from one another. By introducing small mutations in the protein, researchers have produced crystal structures of both the voltage sensing domain and the phosphatase domain from Ci-VSP in what are thought to be the \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" states. These structures have led to a model of VSP activation where movement of the voltage sensor affects a conformational change in a \\"gating loop,\\" moving a glutamate residue in the gating loop away from the catalytic pocket of the phosphatase domain to increase phosphatase activity. Uses in research and in biology VSPs have been used as an tool to manipulate phospholipids in experimental settings. Because membrane potential can be controlled using patch clamp techniques, placing VSPs in a membrane allows for experimenters to rapidly dephosphorylate substrates of VSPs. VSPs' voltage sensors have also been used to engineer genetically encodable voltage sensitive fluorescent probes. These probes allow experimenters to visualize voltage in membranes using fluorescence. However, the normal role which VSPs play in the body is still not well understood.

After a series of talks between American President Gerald Ford and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in Washington and American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's visit to Moscow, Ford traveled to Vladivostok to meet with Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev directly. The two heads of state agreed to terms that would limit both nations an \\"equal aggregate number\\" of various weapons, including strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (SNDVs), intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) fitted with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs).  Background  American President Richard Nixon during the bilateral summit in Moscow on May 24, 1972 MIRV missile path from launch to detonation The Soviet Union and the United States had first reached an agreement on a strategic arms limitation in May 1972 (SALT I) which limited the number of ballistic missiles that each nation could deploy to 2,360 for the Soviets and 1,710 for the Americans. The agreement was not comprehensive, however, as it did not restrict the number of heavy bombers or missiles equipped with multiple warheads (MIRVs) for either country, which by 1974 worked to the advantage of the United States. Because SALT I was due to expire in October 1977, both the Soviet Union and the United States were interested in reaching a more permanent and comprehensive agreement, but initial efforts made by President Richard Nixon and Gromyko were not successful. Eventually, a visit to Moscow by Kissinger in October 1974 made significant headway and allowed for the creation of a general framework for a SALT II pact before Ford even arrived in Vladivostok. Before the Vladivostok Summit began, Ford noted that they only \\"had to button down two things\\": the number of launchers and MIRVs to be permitted for each country, and whether each nation would be given an equal quota for both or if a differential would be used that would allow the Soviets more launchers and the Americans more MIRVs. According to Dobrynin, this potential discrepancy was because the American and Soviet arsenals were \\"from the beginning completely different in both structure and deployment\\". The United States had a \\"strategic triad\\" of nuclear weapons that could be delivered from land, sea, or air (largely due to the blue-water United States Navy and strategic American airbases located around the world), while the Soviet Union had relied on large, long-ranged missiles because its weapons were mostly restricted to its own continental territory. Going into the Summit, Dobrynin alluded to the Soviet desire to find \\"a tricky balance between the larger number of Soviet land-based missiles...and the greater quantity of superior American MIRVed missiles\\". The Americans desired to instead have equal numbers of weapons allowed for both countries, a policy known as \\"numerical equivalency\\", although Kissinger was more optimistic than Ford about the prospects of achieving this. According to Kissinger, the Vladivostok Summit marked \\"the only time in Ford's presidency that he would be representing a united position of his government on SALT\\". Even if an agreement could be reached, he warned the President, \\"the domestic attack on SALT would continue\\". According to Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, it was Ford who proposed the Summit take place in Vladivostok, in part because of a documentary he had watched at the Soviet embassy in Washington about tigers living in the Ussuri taiga in Siberia. After Ford inquired about how far Vladivostok was from Moscow, Dobrynin answered that \\"New York was closer to Moscow than Moscow was to Vladivostok\\". According to Dobrynin, Ford \\"was amazed by the size of my country and said few Americans could comprehend this\\". Kissinger was also excited by the prospects of the Summit taking place in Vladivostok, according to Dobrynin, both because it could be tied in with Ford's trip to Japan and thus \\"appear less deliberately staged\\" and also because of the city's close proximity to the People's Republic of China, which was the other major concern of Kissinger's \\"triangular diplomacy\\".  Arrival in Vladivostok  Brezhnev greets Ford upon his arrival at Vozdvizhenka Airbase on November 23, 1974. The American and Soviet delegations in conversation aboard a Soviet train en route to Okeanskaya Ford and the American delegation arrived at Vozdvizhenka Airbase on the morning of November 23, where they were greeted by Brezhnev and Gromyko. Although the Americans were flying in from Seoul, according to Kissinger they \\"had to double back to Tokyo\\" because the Soviet Union did not have diplomatic relations with South Korea at the time. According to Ford, the Soviets had themselves just completed a four thousand mile trip from Moscow by rail, but according to Dobrynin they too had flown: they had to land at a different airport in the region because of a snowstorm, however, and then took an electric train to complete the last stage of their journey to Vozdvizhenka. According to Ford, he and Brezhnev \\"got along well...from the moment we met\\". Their small talk touched on their mutual previous experiences as sportsmen, as Ford and Brezhnev had played American football and association football, respectively. The heads of state also began to discuss policy on the train and, according to Kissinger, Brezhnev was at first surprised by Ford's \\"straight to the point\\" style because it differed so much from Nixon's more familiar \\"elliptical approach\\". Brezhnev then began making points on arms control, the Middle East, and the European Security Conference before he made an emotional appeal that struck to \\"the heart of the Cold War dilemma\\": according to Kissinger, he lamented the amount of money both the Soviet Union and the United States were spending on the arms race, calling it \\"billions that would be much better spent for the benefit of the people\\". While Kissinger appreciated Brezhnev's \\"ruminations\\", he believed Ford was uninterested in \\"the general philosophy of arms control\\" and rather preferred to \\"discuss these issues in specific terms\\". The train trip from the airport to the Okeanskaya Sanatorium, the site of the summit, took an hour and a half. While Ford spent the time with Brezhnev, he noticed that Kissinger occupied himself with the cookies, pastries, and mints set out on a table in the dining car, much to the amusement of his Soviet hosts: in Ford's estimation, \\"he must have finished off three plates\\". During the trip, Brezhnev suffered a seizure, but he was immediately tended to by his doctor, Evgeny Chazov, and was able to participate in the negotiations as planned. After the Summit, Brezhnev suffered another more severe seizure on his return journey to Moscow, and according to Dobrynin it was at that point that \\"the long countdown to his fatal illness had begun\\". At the end of their train trip, the American and Soviet delegations arrived at Okeanskaya, a spa town frequented by vacationing Soviet military personnel and local politicians that Dobrynin described as \\"a rural community some twenty kilometers from Vladivostok\\". While Ford described the town and its Sanatorium as looking \\"like an abandoned YMCA camp in the Catskills\\", he also noted that Brezhnev did not seem concerned about its appearance. Kissinger described the Sanatorium as a \\"large stone building\\" and noted that it was surrounded by \\"small cottages built of wood\\".  Day one: November 23  Negotiations on the first day of the Summit took place in the conference hall at the Okeanskaya Sanatorium. The American and Soviet delegations taking a break for refreshments during the long nighttime meeting on November 23 The negotiations on November 23 were so productive that they extended into the early hours of November 24. According to Kissinger, the first day of negotiations were held in the Sanatorium's winter garden. Before the actual negotiations began, Kissinger conferred with Ford about strategy, suggesting that the American position should be \\"polite but firm\\". In regards to negotiating with Brezhnev, Kissinger advised Ford that the \\"best approach is to lay out frankly and soberly our position and let him absorb it\\". They both prepared for a confrontational stance presented by Brezhnev and his aides, which Ford believed would be a calculated effort \\"to see if I would bend or fight back\\". According to Dobrynin, \\"Kissinger played the leading role in the deliberations because Ford did not yet know all the details\\". Kissinger himself, however, referred to Ford's involvement in the negotiations as \\"technical\\", contrasting Ford's approach with Nixon's tendency to let Kissinger handle the intricacies of negotiating. After both sides gave their opening statements at the beginning of negotiations proper, they quickly began agreeing on arms control measures that limited each country to 2,400 ballistic missiles and 1,320 MIRVs. Because many of the key points had already been agreed to before the Summit began, Kissinger likened the developments to a Kabuki play: \\"extremely stylized with a near-traditional script and a foreordained outcome\\". Dobrynin referred to these agreements as a \\"compromise\\" from the Soviet perspective, but noted that it \\"eliminated what in our view had been the principal deficiency of the SALT I agreement\\". The negotiations, which at times became extremely technical (Kissinger, for instance, noted a lengthy discussion of the implications of enlarging missile silos by 15%), slowed down as more contentious topics came up. The first of these involved the United States, including its Forward Base System with F-4, F-111, and FB-111 fighters, its nuclear weapons deployed in Western Europe, its production of Trident-equipped Ohio-class submarines, and its plans to build the B-1 bomber. While the Soviet Union was concerned by all of these American weapons, the United States was able to negotiate from a position of strength and preserved all of these advantages: regarding the submarines and the B-1, Ford successfully convinced his Soviet counterparts that his country's \\"national security...demanded that we push forward with both.\\" Conversely, the American delegation \\"wanted the USSR to relinquish a significant number of so- called heavy, land-based ICBMs\\", in the words of Gromyko. According to him, Brezhnev urged his American counterparts to \\"adopt a realistic approach\\", stating that the \\"Soviet Union is not happy that the USA has nuclear weapons in forward positions in Europe and in other regions close to our country. Yet the American leaders will not even discuss this. In such circumstances, the American request concerning Soviet ICBMs cannot be discussed either.\\" Ford then finally withdrew on this issue after consulting his aides and military advisors, a decision that according to Gromyko greatly enhanced the possibility for agreement on SALT II and contributed \\"to a climate of moderation in Soviet-US relations in which each side took account of the other's interests\\". According to Kissinger, Brezhnev also brought up \\"his pet scheme of nuclear condominium between the United States and the Soviet Union\\" during negotiations. Kissinger described the American position as one \\"determined to avoid any impression of a Soviet-American condominium\\", although Ford tempered this stance to a declaration of \\"we never know where we might go\\". After this somewhat strained but greatly productive discussion concerning arms, the negotiations between the two delegations became more general, with Ford admitting the challenge posed by economic difficulties in the United States and Brezhnev explaining that some members of his Politburo did not think détente was a prudent strategy, whom he knew would be highly critical of him if he made too many concessions to the Americans. Then, somewhat to Ford's surprise, Brezhnev began talking in considerable detail about the United States Congress, which the Soviets had come to see as potentially detrimental to their ability to negotiate with American presidents. Trying to plan for the future, Brezhnev asked Ford, \\"What kind of a Congress will you be dealing with for the next two years?\\", to which Ford replied, \\"Mr. General Secretary...I can only say that my fingers are crossed.\\"  Breaks between sessions  The American delegation conversing during one of the breaks, standing outside the Sanatorium to avoid the possibility of being bugged The first day of negotiations was originally planned to last just two hours, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm VLAT, after which the two delegations would break for dinner and then retire for the night before resuming talks the next morning. The negotiations had been so productive, however, that the Soviets and the Americans agreed to forgo dinner and continue the talks, ultimately taking three short breaks that evening instead of one long one to eat. The Americans, afraid that the Sanatorium had been bugged, elected to take their breaks outside, despite the sub-zero temperatures. During one of the breaks, Brezhnev presented Ford with a portrait painting of the American president, and while Ford was quite impressed by the quality of the work he did not think it looked much like him. When he presented the portrait to a group of his American colleagues, photographer David Hume Kennerly joked: \\"Hey now, would you look at that? They gave you a picture of Frank Sinatra.\\" Ford was not amused. The first day negotiations did not end until after midnight, and as Ford was waiting for a much-delayed meal to be served, he remembered that his alma mater, the University of Michigan, was playing the Ohio State University in football that day. Due to the time difference, the game would be occurring during the early morning hours in Vladivostok. Ford then instructed his military aide Bob Barrett to wake him up at 6:00am the next morning with the result of the game, which he did: \\"Twelve to ten\\". Ford responded: \\"Wait a minute. Who had the twelve, and who had the ten?\\" Barrett continued: \\"I was afraid you'd ask me that.\\" It was clear to Ford that Ohio State had won, even before Barrett filled him in on the details of the game, including Michigan's last-second missed field goal.  Day two: November 24  The Soviet delegation leads its American counterpart on a tour of Vladivostok by motorcade. The delegations on the tarmac at Vozdvizhenka Airbase, just moments before Ford informally concluded the Summit by giving his wolfskin coat to Brezhnev The second day of negotiations began shortly after 10:00am, and it focused primarily on developments in the Middle East, efforts to reduce the strength of both American and Soviet forces in Europe, and Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union. According to Kissinger, Gromyko took the lead Soviet role in negotiations that Brezhnev had performed the day before. While Ford described the tenor of the discussions as candid, he also admitted that there were no major breakthroughs. According to Dobrynin, the talks were \\"intense and heated but genuinely businesslike, and without any of the usual protocol formalities\\". In Kissinger's words, the second day of negotiations reflected how \\"essentially theological the SALT debate had become\\": the Soviet Union attempted to limit their weapons to a level they \\"could probably not reach\\" in exchange for limiting the Americans below a number \\"for which we had no plan\\". Nonetheless, Ford was euphoric because of the successes achieved the night before, and according to him Brezhnev \\"shared my enthusiasm\\". After a few minor issues were ironed out, the two heads of state were able to sign a SALT II accord. That afternoon, after the formal negotiations concluded, Brezhnev invited the American delegation on a tour of Vladivostok. Ford enjoyed what he described as a \\"natural and uninhibited\\" conversation with Brezhnev during the tour, and his only regret about it was that he did not have more time to see and explore the city: to him, Vladivostok was reminiscent of San Francisco. Kissinger also saw the resemblance, noting that Vladivostok \\"bore little resemblance to the teeming, hyperactive metropolises of Japan and Korea\\" he had seen before arriving in the Soviet Union. During the tour, Brezhnev unexpectedly grasped Ford's hand and began talking about the Soviet experience during World War II, telling Ford that \\"I do not want to inflict that upon my people again\\". Ford responded that \\"I believe we made very significant progress\\", to which Brezhnev replied \\"it's our responsibility, yours and mine, on behalf of our countries, to achieve the finalization of the document\\". Ford was optimistic about that possibility, remarking: \\"We have made so much headway. This is a big step forward to prevent a nuclear holocaust.\\" Brezhnev agreed, and then characterized the importance of the Summit and the resulting document as \\"an opportunity to protect not only the people of our two countries but, really, all mankind\\". Following the tour of Vladivostok, the American and Soviet delegations returned to Vozdvizhenka Airbase by train, where Air Force One was waiting for the Americans. Ford was wearing a wolfskin coat, given to him by Alaskan furrier and personal friend Jack Kim, which he had been wearing throughout the Summit. Just before he embarked on the airplane, Ford gave his wolfskin coat to Brezhnev, whom he described as \\"truly overwhelmed\\" by the gesture. According to Dobrynin, Brezhnev and Ford seemed to have parted as friends. After the Americans waved goodbye, Air Force One taxied to the runway and took off on its multi-hour flight back to the United States.  Aftermath  Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia during the first of their three presidential debates on September 23, 1976 Reagan, Ford, and Carter together in the White House in 1981 In Ford's estimation, the Summit had been a success: he described it as \\"an appropriate ending to a journey designed to strengthen ties with old friends and expand areas of agreement with potential adversaries\\" and an experience that \\"had exceeded my expectations\\". Kissinger referred to the American delegation as \\"exuberant\\" after departing from Vladivostok, and in his view it was \\"the Soviets who had made almost all the concessions\\". Dobrynin opined that \\"both sides were satisfied with the results of the meeting\\" and even went as far as to call the Vladivostok Summit the high point of détente between the Soviet Union and the United States, claiming that \\"for that Ford deserves credit as well as Brezhnev\\". On December 10, Dobrynin and Kissinger \\"exchanged confidential memoranda with details of the limitations on strategic arms agreed at Vladivostok\\", which would go into force in October 1977 and remain in force until December 1985. In Dobrynin's view, the Summit \\"became a significant starting-point for all subsequent nuclear disarmament talks\\" and \\"provided a sense of continuity to the SALT process\\". Back in the United States, however, Ford came under intense criticism from both the left and the right: many politicians accused him of yielding to Soviet pressure, most notable among them Ronald Reagan. In Kissinger's view, the Ford administration was opposed by many who believed that \\"agreement with the Soviets was more dangerous than stalemate even after a successful summit\\". According to him, major American newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post were generally critical of the Summit. Kissinger also noted the changing focus of the opposition to the agreement at Vladivostok, which first emphasized reductions and then stressed \\"equal throw-weight\\". Against this opposition, Kissinger lamented that the Ford administration \\"watched with dismay as the Vladivostok agreement dissolved before our eyes\\". As the election year of 1976 began, Ford backed away from the SALT process he had been involved in at Vladivostok in 1974, but according to Dobrynin it was not his stance on arms limitation but rather his pardon of Richard Nixon that ultimately cost him the election. In Dobrynin's opinion, the \\"euphoria\\" of détente that had marked the Nixon and Ford years had \\"faded away\\", and after the election of Jimmy Carter as President of the United States in 1976 the policy of détente between the Soviet Union and the United States \\"steadily eroded\\". According to Kissinger, by the time that Reagan became President in 1981, the only way for the Americans to obtain additional reductions from the Soviets was to \\"threaten a buildup of our strategic forces\\". In all, Kissinger believed that the Vladivostok Summit was a failed opportunity to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and its unraveling was evidence that \\"the entire SALT process was floundering and might even collapse\\".

It is used to identify the sequences that act as transcriptional enhancers in a direct, quantitative, and genome-wide manner.STARR-seq Methodology Introduction In eukaryotes, transcription is regulated by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (transcription factors) associated with a gene’s promoter and also by distant control sequences including enhancers. Enhancers are non-coding DNA sequences, containing several binding sites for a variety of transcription factors. They typically recruit transcriptional factors that modulate chromatin structure and directly interact with the transcription machinery placed at the promoter of gene. Enhancers are able to regulate transcription of target genes in a cell type- specific manner, independent of their location or distance from the promoter of genes. Occasionally, they can regulate transcription of genes located in a different chromosome. However, the knowledge about enhancers so far has been limited to studies of a small number of enhancers, as they have been difficult to identify accurately at a genome-wide scale. Moreover, many regulatory elements function only in certain cell types and specific conditions. =Enhancer detection= Enhancer detection in Drosophila is an original methodology using random insertion of transposon-derived vector that encodes a reporter protein downstream of a minimal promoter. This approach allows to observe the expression of reporter in transgenic animals and provides information about nearby genes that are regulated by these sequences. The discovery and characterization of cell types along with genes involved in their determination have been significantly improved by the discovery of this technique. During the past few years, post-genomic technologies, have displayed specific features of poised and active enhancers that have improved enhancer discovery. Development of new methods such as deep sequencing of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DNase-Seq), formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements sequencing (FAIRE-Seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-sequencing) provide genome-wide enhancer predictions by enhancer-associated chromatin features. =Application= DHS- sequencing and FAIRE-sequencing fail to provide a direct functional or quantitative readout of enhancer activity. To obtain this, reporter assays that deduce enhancer strength from the loads of reporter transcripts is needed. Moreover, such assays are not able to offer the millions of tests required for identification of enhancers in genome-wide manner. Development of STARR-seq help to identify enhancers in a direct, quantitative and genome-wide manner. Taking advantage of the knowledge that enhancers can work independent of their relative locations, candidate sequences are placed downstream of a minimal promoter, allowing the active enhancers to transcribe themselves. The strength of each enhancer is then reflected by its richness among cellular RNAs. Such a direct coupling of candidate sequences to enhancer activity enables the parallel evaluation of millions of DNA fragments from arbitrary sources. =Methodology= Genomic DNA is randomly sheared and broken down to small fragments. Adaptors are ligated to size-selected DNA fragments. Next, adaptor linked fragments are amplified and the PCR products are purified followed by placing candidate sequences downstream of a minimal promoter of screening vectors, giving them an opportunity to transcribe themselves. Candidate cells are then transfected with reporter library and cultured. Thereafter, total RNAs are extracted and poly-A RNAs isolated. Using reverse transcription method, cDNAs are produced, amplified and then candidate fragments are used for high-throughput paired end sequencing. Sequence reads are mapped to the reference genome and computational processing of data is carried out. =Enhancer discovery in Drosophila= Applying this technology to Drosophila genome, Arnold et al. found 96% of the non-repetitive genome with at least 10-fold coverage. Authors discovered that most identified enhancers (55.6%) were placed within introns, particularly in the first intron and intergenic regions. 4.5% of enhancers were located at transcription start sites (TSS), suggesting that these enhancers can start transcription and also improve transcription from a distant TSS. The strongest enhancers were near housekeeping genes such as enzymes or component of the cytoskeleton and developmental regulators such as the transcription factors. The strongest enhancer was located within the intron of the transcription factor zfh1. This transcription factor regulates neuropeptide expression and growth of larval neuromuscular junctions in Drosophila. The ribosomal protein genes were the only class of genes with poor enhancers ranking. Moreover, authors demonstrated that many genes are regulated by several independent active enhancers even in a single cell type. Furthermore, gene expression levels on average were correlated with the sum of the enhancer strengths per gene, supporting direct link between gene expression and enhancer activity. = Characterization of Regulatory Variant Alleles in Human Genetic Study Cohorts = Applying this technology to the characterization and discovery of regulatory variant alleles, Vockley et al. characterized the effects of human genetic variation on non-coding regulatory element function, measuring the activity of 100 putative enhancers captured directly from the genomes of 95 members of a study cohort. This approach enables the functional fine-mapping of causal regulatory variants in regions of high linkage disequilibrium identified by eQTL analyses. This approach provides a general path forward to identify perturbations in gene regulatory elements that contribute to complex phenotypes. =Quantifying the enhancer activity of ChIP enriched DNA fragments= STARR-seq has been used to measure the regulatory activity of DNA fragments that have been enriched for sites occupied by specific transcription factors. Cloning ChIP DNA libraries generated from chromatin immunoprecipitation of the glucocorticoid receptor into STARR-seq enabled genome-scale quantification of glucocorticoid-induced enhancer activity. This approach is useful for measuring the differences in enhancer activity between sites that are bound by the same transcription factor. =Advantages= * A quantitative genome-wide assay for enhancer detection. * Applicable technique for screening arbitrary sources of DNA in any cell type or tissue that allows adequate introduction of reporter constructs. * A method with high detection rate (>99%) by employing pair-end sequencing, even for sequences that contain transcript-destabilizing elements. * Technique to evaluate the strength of enhancers quantitatively, and identify endogenously silenced enhancers by integrating them into a chromosomal context. Future Directions STARR-seq by combining traditional approach with high-throughput sequencing technology and highly specialized bio-computing methods is able to detect enhancers in a quantitative and genome-wide manner. The study of gene regulation and their responsible pathways in the genome during normal development and also in disease can be very demanding. Therefore, applying STARR-seq to many cell types across organisms supports identifying cell type-specific gene regulatory elements and practically assesses non-coding mutations causing disease. Recently, a related approach coupling capture of regions of interest to STARR- seq technique have been developed and extensively validated in mammalian cell lines.Vanhille L., A.

It followed the capture in August 1704 of the fortified town of Gibraltar, at the southern tip of Spain, by an Anglo–Dutch naval force led by Sir George Rooke and Prince George of Hesse- Darmstadt. The members of the Grand Alliance, Holy Roman Empire, England, the Netherlands, Pro-Habsburg Spain, Portugal and the Savoy, had allied to prevent the unification of the French and Spanish thrones by supporting the claim of the Habsburg pretender Archduke Charles VI of Austria as Charles III of Spain. They were opposed by the rival claimant, the Bourbon Philip, Duke of Anjou, ruling as Philip V of Spain, and his patron and ally, Louis XIV of France. The war began in northern Europe and was largely contained there until 1703, when Portugal joined the confederate powers. From then, English naval attentions were focused on mounting a campaign in the Mediterranean to distract the French navy and disrupt French and Bourbon Spanish shipping or capture a port for use as a naval base. The capture of Gibraltar was the outcome of that initial stage of the Mediterranean campaign. At the start of the siege, Gibraltar was garrisoned by around 2,000 Dutch, English, Austrian and pro- Habsburg Spanish troops facing a besieging force of up to 8,000 French, pro- Bourbon Spanish and Irish troops. The defenders were able to hold off the numerically superior besieging force through exploiting Gibraltar's geography and the small town's fortifications, though they were frequently short of manpower and ammunition. The besiegers were undermined by disputes between the French and Spanish officers and terrible conditions in their trenches and bastions, which led to outbreaks of epidemic disease and undermined morale. Sea power proved crucial, as the French navy sought unsuccessfully to prevent the Grand Alliance shipping in fresh troops, ammunition and food. Three naval battles were fought during the siege, two of which were clear defeats for the French and the last of which resulted in the siege being abandoned as hopeless after nine months of fruitless shelling. The outcome was disastrous for the French and Bourbon Spanish side, which was said to have lost 10,000 men against only 400 for the Grand Alliance. Background The loss of Gibraltar in August 1704 posed a strategic threat to the rule of the Bourbon claimant to the Spanish throne, Philip V of Spain. It was not only, as a later Spanish writer put it, \\"the first town in Spain to be dismembered from the domination of King Philip and forced to recognise Charles,\\"Hills, p. 178 but it also potentially had great value as an entry point for the Grand Alliance armies. Its possibilities were recognised immediately by the Alliance forces' leader Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, who told Charles in a letter of September 1704, that Gibraltar was \\"a door through which to enter Spain\\". An army landed at Gibraltar could advance rapidly along the coast to Cadiz, supported by naval forces, and capture the major port. From there, it was a relatively short distance to Seville, where the Habsburg claimant Charles could be proclaimed king, following which the Alliance could march to Madrid and finish the war. Gibraltar itself had been largely emptied of its population, most of whom left the town after its capture and had moved to temporary accommodation elsewhere in the Campo de Gibraltar. Only a few dozen Spaniards and a small community of neutral Genoese remained.Jackson, p. 101 The town was garrisoned by a motley assortment of Alliance forces, consisting of around 2,000 British and Dutch marines, 60 gunners and several hundred Spanish, mostly Catalans, followers of Charles of Austria.Hills, p. 183–4 They were supported by Sir George Rooke's Anglo-Dutch fleet consisting of 51 ships of the line operating in the Strait of Gibraltar. The Alliance had two significant disadvantages – limited supplies and a pressing need for their ships, which had already been at sea for six months, to be repaired and reprovisioned. As soon as Gibraltar was captured, the Alliance set about preparing for a Bourbon counter-attack. The Alliance fleet sailed a short distance across the strait to Tetuan in Morocco, where it took on fresh water. On 22 August, a French fleet was sighted in the strait but began to withdraw after being spotted. Rooke caught up with the French off Málaga on 24 August and attacked, in a bid to prevent the French from slipping past him and attacking Gibraltar. The two fleets were evenly matched but the French ships were faster and had more ammunition than the confederates.Jackson, pp. 101–2 They did not manage to make this advantage count, however, and the Battle of Vélez-Málaga was effectively fought to a draw. No ships were sunk but both fleets took very heavy casualties with around 3,000 killed or wounded on each side, including the French commander. The Anglo-Dutch fleet was hampered by a shortage of shot and gunpowder, much of which had already been used in bombarding Gibraltar during the operation to capture it, and Sir George Byng's squadron was forced to pull back when it ran out of ammunition.Alexander, p. 55 The rest of the fleet was dangerously low on ammunition but fortunately for the confederates, the French withdrew the following day, leaving the Anglo-Dutch fleet to limp back to Gibraltar.Hills, p. 180 Having dealt with the French naval threat, Rooke left as many men, guns and supplies at Gibraltar as he could before sailing for home. He split off part of his fleet, leaving Admiral Sir John Leake with 18 ships to patrol the strait and the Portuguese coast. The Spanish had already mobilised their forces and at the start of September the Marquis of Villadarias, the captain- general of Andalusia, arrived in the vicinity of Gibraltar with an army of 4,000 men. Villadarias planned to increase his force to 12,000, consisting of 9,000 Spaniards and 3,000 Frenchmen. The Two Crowns force was also supplemented by many of the civilian refugees from Gibraltar.Jackson, p. 103 Siege Hesse set about improving Gibraltar's defences to make it as difficult as possible for the enemy to mount a frontal attack. The town is set on the western side of a rocky peninsula connected to the Spanish mainland by a narrow sandy isthmus. The north side of the Rock of Gibraltar presents a vertical cliff; the only access to the town was via a narrow strip, only about wide, which was blocked by the heavily fortified curtain wall known as the Muralla de San Bernardo (later the Grand Battery).Jackson, p. 105 The prince sought to reduce this strip even further by flooding it, forcing any attackers to use a narrow path between the Rock and the inundated area or to advance along the narrow shoreline. He set up cannon in five batteries along the north side of Gibraltar: on the Old Mole, to provide flanking fire from the west; on the Baluarte de San Pablo (later North Bastion) and on the Landport curtain walls, to provide direct fire onto the isthmus; on the Baluarte de San Pedro (later Hesse's Demi Bastion), to provide flanking fire from the east; and in a Round Tower, on a clifftop spur overlooking the isthmus (later the site of Forbes' Batteries), from where fire could be directed onto enemy troops on the far side of the inundated area. A \\"bomb ship\\" was also installed off the Old Mole, carrying a heavy mortar to provide additional flanking fire from the west.Jackson, p. 106 The northern approach to Gibraltar as seen in 1567; the view would have been substantially the same in 1704 Although Hesse was confident that he would be able to hold Gibraltar against the numerically superior Franco-Spanish force, he was undermined by political disputes between the Habsburg and English commanders. There was widespread resentment among the English marines that they had not been allowed to return with Rooke's fleet. There was a particularly poisonous relationship between the English Colonel of Marines Edward Fox and the Irish Colonel Henry Nugent, whom Hesse had appointed as Governor of Gibraltar. The two men had fought on opposite sides during the Irish campaign of William III; the Protestant Fox had gone on to serve Queen Anne, while the Catholic Nugent had joined the service of Charles of Austria.Hills, p. 182 Hesse wrote that Fox was \\"furious at being under my orders and at not being allowed to leave for England. His respect for the Governor I have appointed is even less. There is confusion everywhere. Orders are not carried out, and the officers are the first to make trouble . . .\\"Hills, p. 181 Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, who commanded the garrison of Gibraltar during the siege The besieging French and Spanish forces were reinforced on 4 October when 19 French warships \\"great and small of the line of battle\\"Hills, p. 186 escorted troop ships carrying 3,000 men with heavy guns and supplies of ammunition to a landing point near the ruined Roman town of Carteia at the head of the Bay of Gibraltar. This brought the number of soldiers under Villadarias's command to some 7,000, which Hesse estimated consisted of eight Spanish and six French battalions of foot plus nine cavalry squadrons. Most of the French ships left on 24 October, to the surprise of the defenders, though six remained behind to blockade Gibraltar. After the reinforcements had settled in, the Spanish began digging siege lines and trenches towards the confederate positions. The first attack came on 26 October when Spanish guns opened fire on the confederate defences around the Round Tower, causing considerable damage. A French force carried out a simultaneous raid of Gibraltar's harbour, burning the bomb ship. Villadarias then carried out a heavy bombardment of the San Pablo bastion using 27 guns and 16 mortars, which managed to breach it.Hills, p. 187 Among the casualties were the two feuding colonels, Fox and Nugent, who were killed on successive days.Jackson, p. 107 At the same time, an epidemic disease broke out among the Gibraltar garrison, reducing their effective numbers to about 1,300 men. The position of the garrison looked increasingly precarious. Hesse sent a message to Admiral Leake at Lisbon requesting his urgent assistance after the appearance of French ships in the bay. After receiving the message on 21 October, Leake set sail at once, bringing more supplies for the defenders. In the meantime, Hesse had to deal with an internal threat – a plot by some Habsburg Spanish officers, aided by some clergymen and British officers, to betray the garrison. He wrote to Charles in mid-October to inform the Archduke of what had happened: Charles wrote back advising Hesse to carry out a court- martial with independent judges to avoid any suspicion of prejudice. As the accused were Habsburg subjects, a court-martial consisting of British and Dutch officers – who did not owe allegiance to Charles – was convened to adjudicate the case. The British officers who were implicated in the plot appear to have been sent back to England; their fate is not recorded. Gonzalez was convicted and on 23 February 1705, \\"being guilty of high treason [he] was shot in the face of the whole garrison.\\" =Assault on the east side= The sheer east side of the Rock of Gibraltar, which was scaled by a Bourbon Spanish force on 11 November 1704 to carry out an unsuccessful surprise attack The Bourbon Spanish, meanwhile, were planning to carry out a surprise attack. Simón Susarte, a Spanish goatherd who had fled Gibraltar after its capture by Rooke a few months earlier, told Villadarias that there was a secret route by which the east side of the Rock of Gibraltar could be scaled. It required a climb of around , of which the upper section was near-vertical, but was passable with the use of rope and ladders via the Great Sand Dune. As the east side was considered virtually impregnable, only the west side was fortified; if the Rock could be climbed from the east, an attacker could evade the fortifications and descend directly into the town. The route was reconnoitred and found to be passable by a lightly armed force. Villadarias decided to send a force of 2,000 men – nearly a third of his entire army – divided into two groups: an initial force of 500 to seize the heights at night, followed by a further 1,500 the following daybreak. The first 500 set off at dusk on 11 November, led by a Colonel Figueroa and guided by Simón Susarte. They made it to the top of the Rock, reaching its southernmost peak near where O'Hara's Battery stands today, and descended part-way down the west side where they sheltered overnight in St. Michael's Cave. At daybreak they climbed the Philip II Wall, which extends up the west side of the Rock, and killed the English sentries in the lookout point at Middle Hill. A drummer boy bringing food to the lookout saw the invaders and raised the alarm.Hills, p. 187–8 Route over the Rock of Gibraltar by the unsuccessful Bourbon surprise attack Hesse had anticipated some kind of attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich.De la Penya i Parell, Narcís Feliu: Anales de Cataluña. Vol. III. Barcelona: Juan Pablo Martí, 1709, pp. 526-527 This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons had the advantage of height, they were effectively trapped against the precipice of the Rock and only had three rounds of ammunition each, as a result of travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle. The Spanish Habsburg force led by Captain Burguy, made up of miquelets and regulars, marched ahead and dislodged the Spanish Bourbon grenadiers from the top of the hill. At the same time, Sandoval, with his remaining regulars and miquelets, charged upon the bulk of the assaulting force from one flank, while Heinrich von Hesse attacked from the other side. Around a hundred of the Bourbon force, including their colonel, were captured. Hundreds more were killed, either by defending fire or by falling off the Rock while attempting to flee. Only a few, including Simón Susarte, made it back to the Bourbon lines. The English subsequently ensured that there would be no repeat of this episode by blasting away the path used by the Spanish. The other 1,500 members of the Spanish force did not even set off to support the attack because, after the first 500 had left, Admiral Leake's squadron was sighted entering the bay with 20 ships. In the subsequent naval engagement, six French frigates were destroyed and a seventh ship was captured intact. Villadarias had apparently intended to carry out a multi- pronged attack but Leake's timely arrival meant that it fell apart. The French naval support for an assault on the moles evaporated, and a frontal assault via the isthmus – reinforced with the 1,500 men originally earmarked for the climb on the eastern side – failed entirely. Hesse's relief at Leake's timely arrival was evident in the letter that he sent the admiral after the battle, thanking him for turning up just as \\"the enemy were attacking us that very night of your entrance in many places at once with a great number of men.\\"Hills, p. 188–9 Leake had not brought many supplies to Gibraltar but provided what he could, and loaned Hesse the fleet's skilled manpower, of which the confederate garrison was desperately short. A labour force of some 500 men was assembled from the ships' companies and was put to work repairing the fortifications, remounting guns dislodged by Spanish fire and hauling cannon up the Rock to increase the fire being directed onto the Spanish batteries.Hills, p. 190 One of those involved, Captain Willis, played such a prominent role that the track he used was renamed (and is still known as) Willis' Road, and he also gave his name to Willis' Battery (now Princess Royal's Battery), Magazine and Guard.Jackson, p. 108 The siege settled down into a routine of bombardment and counter-bombardment. This proved increasingly trying for the defenders, who were running short of manpower, ammunition and supplies. Captain Joseph Bennett, an engineer whom Leake had brought with him, helped to bolster the fortifications but earned the wrath of some in the garrison, who felt that Gibraltar should be abandoned. He wrote to a friend on 6 December to tell him that \\"many officers had a design to quit the place and blow up the works but I always opposed them, and mentioned the garrison could be kept with the number of 900 men we had, and no more, as I believe you will have an [account] of. Some was for cuting (sic) my Throat and others for cuting (sic) off my Ears &c.;\\"Kenyon, p. 121 Many members of the garrison tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay and straw.Sayer, pp. 139–140 =Reinforcements= Marshal de Tessé, who made an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the siege at the start of 1705 A few days later, Leake received the news that a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements was on its way from Lisbon, escorted by four men- of-war. Adverse winds and currents meant that he was unable to sail to assist it against a French naval force that had left Cadiz, and he was forced to wait to see if the convoy would reach its destination. On 18 December, nine of the transports reached the bay, accompanied by two men-of-war, with another seven arriving on 20 December. Four were missing, having been intercepted by the French; three of them had been sunk or captured while the last one eventually made it to Gibraltar at the end of December. They brought with them 2,200 men from the Grenadier Guards, Donegal's Foot and Barrymore's Foot, plus some Dutch troops, guns and supplies of powder, tools and food. Further reinforcements arrived between 16–18 January. With Gibraltar safe for the moment, Leake left for Lisbon on 3 January with sick and wounded members of the garrison aboard his ships.Jackson, p. 109 The Bourbon Spanish and French land force continued to bombard Gibraltar, inflicting further damage on the town's somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make any progress against the reinforced garrison. They were being vigorously opposed with counter-bombardments, which killed many of their number, and by sallies, two of which were carried out successfully by the confederates on 23 and 31 December. Relations steadily worsened between the Spanish and French components of the besieging force, a trend that was exacerbated by the lack of progress they were making, the appalling conditions they were enduring in the open and the steady stream of casualties being caused by the counter- bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease. The weather, too, was terrible, with storms and heavy rain making life a misery. By the New Year of 1705, the besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7,000 men to only 4,000, the remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting.Jackson, p. 110 The situation was sufficiently alarming that King Louis XIV of France despatched Marshal René de Froulay de Tessé along with 4,500 French and Irish reinforcements to recover the situation. Villadarias, however, was determined to make one more effort to take Gibraltar before Tessé arrived. On 7 February, he sent 1,500 French, Spanish and Irish troops to seize the Round Tower, an outlying fortification on the cliff face above the present Laguna Estate. The attackers captured the tower but a confederate counter-attack drove them out, leaving 200 of them dead. The Spanish accused the French of fleeing the battlefield and leaving their flank unprotected.Jackson, p. 111 Baron de Pointis' fleet defeated in the Bay of Gibraltar, 20 March 1705 Tessé arrived in mid-February but was appalled to find how badly the siege was being run. His criticism of the Spanish officers led some to quit the siege in the face of what they saw as his insults. Their morale improved somewhat when Admiral Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis sailed into the bay on 26 February with a force of 18 men-of-war from Cadiz. Gibraltar's garrison immediately went on alert, expecting a landing at the south end of the peninsula, but this did not materialise. The reason soon became clear; Leake had returned with a combined English, Dutch and Portuguese force of 35 ships. In the subsequent battle in the Strait of Gibraltar, the French lost five of their ships, including Pointis' flagship, and Pointis himself was fatally wounded. Leake's fleet sailed into the bay on 31 March, bringing with it fresh troops from Mountjoy's Grenadiers and units of the Portuguese army. Hesse rejoiced at the admiral's arrival: =End of the siege= Leake's arrival was \\"the final stroke\\", as the French abandoned the siege as hopeless following an order from Louis XIV on 12 April.Alexander, p. 64 Tessé wrote bitterly to the king to blame the Spanish, telling him that \\"we have failed before Gibraltar for want of method and planning . . . the ill- fate of your vessels was due to lack of competence at Madrid . . .\\" With the French having gone home, Villadarias resumed command and began to convert the siege into a blockade by pulling back from the isthmus and removing his cannon. On 2 May, an Alliance scouting party found that the Spanish trenches had been abandoned. Later that day, Hesse accompanied a demolition party to destroy the Bourbon Spanish works, but some members of the party ventured out too far and were captured or killed by the Spanish cavalry. The following day, a larger party, protected by grenadiers, resumed the work of demolishing the Spanish batteries without further opposition, marking the end of the siege.Alexander, p. 65 Aftermath During the rest of the War of Spanish Succession, Gibraltar would remain in Grand Alliance hands. After the siege George of Hesse left Gibraltar and took command of the conquest of Barcelona. He was later killed on 13 September, storming the citadel of Montjuich. Following Hesse's departure Gibraltar was governed by British commandant Major General John Shrimpton as a possession of Duke Charles of Austria as Charles III of Spain on the advice of Queen Anne.Jackson, p. 113.. The Queen subsequently declared Gibraltar a free port at the insistence of the Sultan of Morocco, though she had no formal authority to do so. Shrimpton was replaced in 1707 by Colonel Roger Elliott, who was replaced in turn by Brigadier Thomas Stanwix in 1711. This time the appointments were made directly by London with no claim of authority from Charles. Stanwix was ordered to expel all foreign troops from Gibraltar to secure its status as an exclusively British possession but failed to evict the Dutch, apparently not considering them \\"foreign\\".Jackson, p. 114. The War of the Spanish Succession was finally settled in 1713 by a series of treaties and agreements. Under the Treaty of Utrecht, which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the Southern Netherlands, Naples, Milan, and Sardinia to Austria; Sicily and some Milanese lands to Savoy; and Gibraltar and Menorca to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish slave trading in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called asiento. With regard to Gibraltar (Article X), the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain \\"for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.\\" The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first have to offer the territory to Spain.Jackson, pp. 113, 333–334.Abulafia, p. 47. Gibraltar as a possession of Great Britain would endure two more sieges both of which ended in British victories. The first in 1727 which took place during the Anglo-Spanish war, and the second during the American Revolutionary War being the largest and longest from 1779-83.

This breed is usually colored black but it is also found in brown, white or gray. The Black Bengal goat is small in size but its body structure is tight. Its horns are small and legs are short. An adult male goat weights about 25 to 30 kg and female 20 to 25 kg. It is poor in milk production. It is very popular in Bangladesh because of its low demand for feed and high kid production rate. The Black Bengal goats gain sexual maturity at earlier age than most other breeds. The female goat becomes pregnant twice a year and gives birth to one to three kids. This breed can adapt to any environment easily and its disease resistance is very high. It produces high-quality meat and skin, and is preferred for the skin and high prolificacy rate. This breed plays a very important role in reducing unemployment and poverty from Bangladesh. They can eat most vegetables, grasses and leaves, but a high amount of carrots is fatal to them.  Genome  The mystery of life of the world's best and one and only breed of Black Bengal Goat of Bangladesh has been revealed through Whole Genome Sequencing by the \\"Genomics Research Group\\" lead by Dr. AMAM Zonaed Siddiki, Professor of Department of Pathology and Parasitology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (CVASU). The genome analysis of Black Bengal Goat has shown that its genome size is about 3.04 gb of which around 31.85% are repeats. Though it is predicted that there are 26,458 genes in 29 chromosomes; the gene structure annotation of only 12,589 genes are done. In addition to that, at least one ontology term was found among 8173 genes. Currently, one of the research papers of the project has been accepted and published by the reputed scientific journal BMC under the company Springer Nature. Another part of the research has been published in Mitochondrial DNA Part B of Taylor and Francis Group in addition to all the data being recognized by NCBI. Besides, while the research was going on, its abstract was presented for the first time in \\"The 2nd World Conference on Sheep\\" organized by the Nanjing Agricultural University. To conduct the project successfully all the members of the team were trained accordingly. For further training, one of the members of the team, Masum Billah, was sent to the Big Data Laboratory of Professor Dr. Yu Jiang in Northwest A&F; University of China and another member, Kazi Shawrob, was sent to the Mizoram University of India. The other members of the team were Mahadia Kumkum, Mohammad Atique Ul Alam, Sourav Saha Pritthi, Montaha Chowdhury, Mehedi Hasan Rumi and Md. Sirajul Islam. For data analysis, a high speed computer of 128 gb RAM was installed in CVASU and the server of University Grants Commission of Bangladesh was used. Most of the research was conducted in Bangladesh, but for some parts a very advanced server was required which was conducted in Australia by Dr. Abdul Baten of Southern Cross University. Though the whole genome sequencing of Hilsha and Jute was done before in Bangladesh, the genome size of the Black Bengal Goat is the largest. Genome is the complete set of genes or genetic makeup present in an organism which is necessary for birth, living and reproduction. The genes have all the information of the organism such as how it came into existence and evolved, what are its characteristics, how it grows and protects itself in adverse situations. The process of getting all these information from the genes is called genome sequencing. Genome sequencing tells about the exact location and function of the genes which are necessary for different physiological activities from an organism’s birth to death.

Early life and career Simons grew up in New York City, the daughter of artists. She was involved in theater at the New Lincoln School and in college at Cornell University and Ithaca College.Road Trip Nation When Simons was 30 she met husband Kenny Ausubel in Santa Fe, New Mexico and helped him complete and distribute a documentary film on the politics of cancer treatment called Hoxsey: When Healing Becomes a Crime. Although ahead of its time, the film achieved significant outreach, including being featured on HBO/Cinemax and screened for Congress, leading to the establishment of the Office of Technology Assessment, federally, which was formed to investigate and research alternative therapies. After visiting Gabriel Howearth's biodiversity gardens near Gila, New Mexico, Simons quit her job and joined Howearth and husband Ausubel at their fledgling seed company, Seeds of Change. Within a year, she became President of the social entrepreneurship, and helped to grow the company toward profitability until the mid-1990s.Simons, Moonrise: The Power of Women Leading from the Heart, p.4 She left Seeds of Change to become the strategic marketing director for Odwalla, building their brand and connecting the company with nonprofit organizations that could help Odwalla increase its market share and sustainable business practices. Utne Reader, March–April 1996 Bioneers In 1990, Simons and Ausubel co-founded the Bioneers organization and national conference to highlight existing solutions to many of the world's environmental and social challenges. The idea for the National Bioneers Conference arose from a 1989 meeting with Josh Mailman, a leader in social investment and philanthropy who was involved with Seeds of Change and the Hoxsey film. When Ausubel described various biomimetic innovators and other breakthrough environmental and social solutions, Mailman proposed a conference and offered to help fund it.The Bioneers Creation Story Simons is now Bioneers' Chief Relationship Strategist. =UnReasonable Women for the Earth= In the late 1990s, Simons began to focus on developing women's leadership and restoring balance to the feminine and masculine in the world. In 2002 she facilitated her first retreat for women leaders, called UnReasonable Women for the Earth, uniting 34 women to brainstorm how to initiate a broad progressive women's movement with environment at its heart.Source Watch The name, sparked by Diane Wilson at the 2001 Bioneers Conference, stemmed from the belief that women were often raised to be too 'well behaved,' or 'reasonable,' conditioning which inhibits women from taking a bold stand for what they believe in. UnReasonable Women for the Earth encouraged \\"women everywhere to stand together and at each other's backs, in defense of life. Its goal is to strengthen women's voices and encourage women's engagement.\\" The retreat resulted in the formation of CodePink: Women for Peace, a grassroots organization advocating for peace.Feigenbaum, The GreenMoney Interview GreenMoney Journal March/April, 2004 =Cultivating Women's Leadership= In 2006, Simons - in collaboration with Toby Herzlich and Akaya Windwood - co-created a 6-day immersion intensive called Cultivating Women's Leadership. Transformative in nature, each gathering (now co- facilitated with Rachel Bagby, Elsa Menendez and Toby Herzlich) chooses women by application who are committed to change-making, have influence in their communities, and are selected to optimize diversity in every way in each cohort (at least 30% and often 40-50% of each cohort are indigenous or women of color). Typically two intensives are offered per year, and more can be found through http://cultivatingwomensleadership.org/ (see External Link below). This program has been on hiatus since 2017. =Other Teaching, Speaking and Consulting= Simons teaches and speaks on topics including Regenerative Leadership, Valuing Diversity as Essential to Healthy Systems, and Reclaiming a Healthy Feminine and Masculine within us All...and consults on gender balance and women's leadership for corporations and organizations.

Bernstein and D.F. Krell, Times Higher Education Supplement, 12 February 1988 He has conjoined the rigorous approach to matters of meaning and logic typical of the former and the depth and range of reference typical of the latter in a constructive and critical engagement with the work of Jacques Derrida and Emmanuel Levinas.  Education and career  Llewelyn was born in Rogerstone, near Newport, South Wales and educated at Rogerstone Elementary School and Bassaleg Grammar School. After taking a degree in French at Aberystwyth University he went on to take an Honours degree in philosophy at Edinburgh University and pursue postgraduate studies in philosophy at Oxford. He has held teaching posts at the University of New England, as Reader in Philosophy at Edinburgh University and as Visiting Professor of Philosophy at the University of Memphis and Loyola University Chicago.  Work  A collegiate and enduring friendship with Derrida was established at their first meeting at the 1972 Cerisy-la-Salle décade on Nietzsche, an encounter that would lead to Llewelyn becoming one of the first Anglophone philosophers to engage constructively with Derrida's thought. Llewelyn's 1986 Derrida on the Threshold of Sense contributed to a marked shift in the Anglo-American response to Derrida's work, up until then largely the province of literary and cultural theory.Christopher Norris, Derrida, London: Fontana 1987, p. 245 In 1995 Llewelyn published the first systematic exposition and critical evaluation of the work of Emmanuel Levinas to appear in the English language. The summary of the philosophical doctrines Levinas interrogates, presented in the Introduction to that work (1995: 1–4) – Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Bergson, Husserl, Heidegger– is itself indicative of the depth of scholarship and range of reference Llewelyn marshals throughout his own later work which also has additional important points of reference in the work of Wittgenstein, Saussure, Peirce, J.L. Austin and Duns Scotus and a range of literary figures, notably Emily Dickinson, Wordsworth, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Rilke. Taking his point of departure from Derrida's last seminars on the animal and moving beyond Levinas's ethics of the Other,Jacques Derrida, The Animal That Therefore I Am, New York: Fordham University Press 2008, p. 107 Llewelyn has elaborated a \\"metaphysics of singular responsibility\\" (1991: 172) which effects a deconstruction of the boundaries between the human and the non-human and, in challenging the anthropocentric bias of Levinas’s ethics, inaugurates a \\"widening of our conception of the ethical and the political toward the ecological\\", a \\"widening of the constituency of the other to whom I owe responsibility\\" (2012a: 1, 288). In conjunction with this undertaking Llewelyn develops a radicalised and enlarged concept of imagination Sean Hand, Emmanuel Levinas, London: Routledge 2009, p. 130 as the \\"chief religious faculty\\", wherein religion is reconceptualised as, per se, the relation to the world as other and as such \\"is not dependent on, though not incompatible with, institutionalised religion or a certain traditional divinity\\" (2012b: 314; 2012a, 2009).

They provide 29 liquor licenses to wholesalers, manufacturers, retailers and the general public. New Jersey is the only other state, other than Wisconsin, to consider a DUI or DWI a minor traffic offense. Alcohol is also allowed on public transportation, making it more accessible to the public. In addition to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations are limited to two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer as they do in many other states. State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws. New Jersey has a strong tradition of municipal home rule. Local municipalities thus have considerable authority in the licensing and regulating of alcohol-related businesses. These powers include: limiting the number of licenses to sell alcoholic beverages at retail (Class C licenses), limiting the hours of retail alcohol sales, prohibiting the retail sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday, regulating the conduct of any retail establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages, regulating the nature and condition of the licensed premises limiting persons within the municipality to a single liquor license, limiting a license to cover only the specific licensed premises; and allowing municipalities with populations of 15,000 or more to appoint a municipal alcoholic beverage control board of three persons with terms for three years.[22] The New Jersey Wine Industry Advisory Council was created in 1985 in accordance with New Jersey Statutes () The duties of the advisory council are \\"to assess the condition of the wine industry and to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on expenditures for research, development, and promotion of the New Jersey wine industry from the New Jersey Wine Promotion Fund.\\" New Jersey State Department of Agriculture. Commodities Councils - New Jersey Wine Industry Advisory Council. Retrieved 1 March 2013.() New Jersey's wine production industry has experienced significant growth from seven small wineries to 48 (as of 2014) since the passage of the 1981 New Jersey Farm Winery Act. The act initiated the repeal of Prohibition-era alcoholic beverage control laws that severely constrained the industry for fifty years. The council has eight members who serve for terms of three years. Two of the council's members are appointed by virtue of their positions in the State Government (i.e. the state Secretary of Agriculture, and the Commissioner of Commerce, Energy and Economic Development) and one (i.e. the Dean of Cook College at Rutgers University) because of his or her position at the state's sole land grant university under the Morrill Act of 1862. Cook College, named for nineteenth-century professor George Hammell Cook was previously known as the Rutgers Scientific School and College of Agriculture and is home to the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service. In 2007, Cook College—a residential college at Rutgers with a focus on agriculture and specializes in environmental science, animal science and other life sciences—was reorganized as the \\"School of Environmental and Biological Sciences\\" (SEBS). The remaining five members are appointed from the general public by the State Board of Agriculture—two of whom shall be holders of a plenary winery license, two of whom shall be holders of a farm winery license and one of whom shall be a viticulturist (). New Jersey is one of only two states (along with Wisconsin) that classify DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death.[169] Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do not have the right to a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity. , the eight current members of New Jersey Wine Industry Advisory Council are: * Jack Tomasello, Tomasello Winery (Council Chairman) * Anthony Valenzano, Valenzano Winery * Janet Giunco, Four JG's Orchards & Vineyards * Ollie Tomasello, Tomasello Winery * William Heritage, Heritage Vineyards * Douglas H.

In 1991 the publishing house was taken by Alessandro Dalai (that bought the shares owned by the publishing group Elemond) and Oreste del Buono. The house was so raised offering numerous book series focused on fiction, nonfiction, history, economy, humor and satire (with the series Le formiche). An important part of their publications was reserved to debuts and emerging writers.\\"Baldini & Castoldi, nuovi talenti addio (forse resta la Tamaro)\\", La Stampa, 4 December 1999, p.11. A key role in the revitalization of the brand was given by the success of the humorous books by Gino and Michele and then by Va dove ti porta il cuore, a novel written by Susanna Tamaro which became in a short time an international bestseller. According to a 1997 report, made on the occasion of the centenary of \\"Baldini e Castoldi\\", after the Dalai's relaunch the house had 25 employees, an income between 35 and 40 billion lire a year and published about 150 books a year.Claudio Altarocca, \\"Baldini & Castoldi, cent'anni\\", La Stampa, 4 December 1997, p.1. In July 2000, Dalai completed the acquisition of the house pointing out the shares owned by the Mondadori Group (since 1994), adding his name to the brand of the publisher. In 2011 the company changed its name to Dalai Editore and \\"Baldini & Castoldi\\" became a series of Dalai Editore. Dalai Editore closed down in 2013. The name \\"Baldini&Castoldi;\\" still lives on thanks to the effort of a new publishing house, simply named \\"Baldini&Castoldi;\\".

In popular culture Adrián de Moxica was portrayed by Michael Wincott in the Ridley Scott's 1992 film 1492: Conquest of Paradise. Moxica fills a prominent role in the film as Columbus' nemesis, who assumes the role as the leader of Roldán's rebellion with his right-hand Hernando de Guevara (played by Arnold Vosloo). In the film, Moxica cuts off the hand of a Native American who claimed to have found no gold to pay for his taxes. Eventually, once confronted by both Columbus and his allies, he commits suicide by allowing himself to fall off of a steep cliff rather then be captured.

Toledo Free Press. by Stacy Jurich who sang with the New York City Opera, The New Metropolitan Opera and the Düsseldorf Opera. Early life and education He was born March 7, 1934 in Brownsville, Tennessee, the eleventh of fourteen brothers and sisters. His father was a Baptist preacher and farmer/sharecropper. Eugene attended Cole elementary school and Washington Technical High school in St. Louis, and then Harris Stowe Teachers State College until his sophomore year, when he auditioned for the St. Louis Music Chore and won a full scholarship to University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. Career After graduating, he returned to St. Louis where he worked as a social worker in the Pruitt Igo projects. Later he was certified as a teacher and taught elementary school, then high school for several years. He served in the Navy from 1956 to 1959 aboard on the USS Conflict. During this time, he sang in the Navy Blue Jackets. Holmes went with a friend to a rehearsal of the American opera The Crucible. There he met accompanist and director Dorothy Zeigler, who was also the first trombonist for the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. Dorothy introduced Holmes to Boris Godofsky, who ran the opera workshop in Wheeling, West Virginia. Godofsky offered Holmes a leading role in his yearly opera workshop for young musicians. After the clinic, Holmes was offered a scholarship and attended University of Indiana in Bloomington. He began performing with the Metropolitan Opera National Touring Company soon after completing his graduate education. A year later, in 1966, he made his debut in the New York Metropolitan opera filling in for a role in Aida. Holmes was an artist in resident at Toogaloo College in Mississippi and the Music Faculty at University of Miami. In 1970, Holmes performed with Plácido Domingo in Aida in the Vienna State Opera. Holmes sang with the New York City Opera, and in 1971 he played the role of Ukamba written for him by Gian Carlo Menotti, in the world premier of The Most Important Man.

However, from the Aztec period to the 20th century, it was sparsely populated and very poor, with one main indigenous ethnicity, the Otomis. In the 20th century, irrigation works were created to take advantage of the water in the Tula River, along with wastewater drained from the Valley of Mexico for agriculture. Today the valley produces various grains and produce, including one-quarter of all green chili peppers grown in Mexico. Geography and environment View of the Tula River in Tula Municipality, State of Hidalgo. The Mezquital Valley is located in the central Mexican Highlands about north of Mexico City. It covers in the west of the state of Hidalgo and small portions extending into the State of Mexico and Querétaro. With an altitude of between above sea level, it is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The valley consists of smaller valleys such as the Actopan, Ixmiquilpan, and the Tasquillo, along with some flatlands. What unifies the region is its waterways, such as the Tula and Alfajayucan rivers, as well as streams such as the Alfajayucan, Arroyo Zarco, Rosas and Salado, as well as history and culture. It is one of the four main arid/semi arid regions of Mexico, along with Baja California, the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley, and the Chihuahua Desert. These four regions together account for 60 percent of Mexico's territory. The average annual precipitation of the valley is , less than half of the state average of . In the elevations of surrounding mountains between , the climate is temperate and moister, with rains in the summer. Below this level, the area is semi-arid steppe. The valley is drained by the Tula River. The vegetation of the valley is divided into zones. Forests of pine and oak dominate the higher mountain areas. The lower valley floor is semi-arid except for areas along riverbanks which have some tropical vegetation. In some canyons, thermal inversion also allows for a more humid climate. Dominant vegetation includes various cacti, mesquite, and maguey, as most of the valley is dry. Other important wild species include cypresses (Taxodium mucronatum and Cupressus spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), oak (Quercus spp.), huisache (Vachellia farnesiana), cardón (Ilex or Pachycereus spp.), barrel cactus (Echinocactus spp.), yucca (Yucca spp.), huapilla (Hechtia spp.), cucharilla (Dasylirion spp.), cat's claw (Mimosa spp.), zacate (Setaria spp. or Muhlenbergia macroura), chipil (Crotalaria spp.), pasto de agua (Potamogeton pusillus), reeds (Scirpus or Typha spp.), and various species of the family Asteraceae. It has significant biodiversity in its fauna but much is relatively unstudied. Economic development in the 20th century has caused environmental problems, especially in the south of the valley. These include air and soil pollution from an important refinery and electric power plant near the city of Tula. The most serious problem comes from wastewater which is pumped into the area from the neighboring Valley of Mexico. The wastewater comes from drainage projects that carry water out of the Valley of Mexico and dump it into the Tula River, with most of the water not treated adequately or not treated at all. The wastewater is a mix of residential and industrial water, which includes contaminants such as bacteria (such as cholera) from fecal matter and toxic chemicals. This contamination is severe enough in places to be seen and smelled. Nevertheless, the water is an important source for irrigated farming, especially in the Tula and Alfajayucan areas, with the water \\"treated\\" by letting it soak through the soil. The water causes contamination of groundwater, including water that eventually becomes part of the Pánuco River, affecting coastal lagoons on the Gulf of Mexico. Demographics and economy Mezquital Otomi Traditional Otomi dress on display at the Museo de Arte Popular. The valley covers 33.7% of the state of Hidalgo and is divided politically into 27 municipalities, with a population of about 420,000. While most inhabitants are mestizo, the Otomi people have been the dominant indigenous ethnicity since the Classic period of the Mesoamerican era. The center of the Otomi community is Ixmiquilpan. The weaving trade was a way to survive in the harsh environment before the introduction of irrigated farming. The Otomi language of the valley is classified as a dialect, spoken by an estimated 115,000 people, especially in the municipalities of San Salvador, Chilcuautla, Ixmiquilpan, Alfajayucan, Tasquillo, Nicolás Flores, Cardonal, and Huichapan. Traditionally, these Otomi are known for their handcrafts, especially the creation of textiles from ixtle fiber and the making of pulque, both from the maguey plant. Both are usually made by Otomi families who gather the raw materials and sell the finished products. Many Otomis still use garments made of undyed cotton called \\"manta\\". Women wear a blouse or shirt with a square neckline, which has embroidery. Over this many wear quechquemitls, of blue, purple, or black wool, as well as rebozos in similar colors and designs. The lower half of the body is covered by a wraparound skirt. Women usually braid their hair with ribbons or strips of fabric, and wear huarache sandals. The Otomi municipality of Ixmiquilpan is noted for its use of insect projects such as escamoles (ant eggs/larvae) and mezcal worms. These are often eaten in tacos or gorditas, along with various sauces. Another important food is the nopal cactus, as well as seeds and flowers from other cactus species. The Muestra Gastronómica del Valle del Mezquital, which began in 1980, is an annual demonstration of the gastronomic and cultural diversity of the valley. It is held in the community of Santiago de Anaya and includes indigenous storytelling and dance along with food. A significant percentage of the population lives under what is called usos y costumbres (uses and customs), a legal way to allow indigenous communities to keep traditional authority structures. These are concerned with community rather than individual welfare, based on systems from the pre-Hispanic and colonial periods. These particularly apply to Otomi communities. However, there have been problems with these, with sanctions deemed severe and authorities accused of being arbitrary. There have also been problems with tribal law conflicting with the rights guaranteed by the Mexican Constitution. For example, in Ixmiquilpan, Tasquillo, Nopala, Huichapan, and Chapantongo, women are not allowed to vote for community authorities. Since the latter 20th century, the valley has become an important agricultural center for the state of Hidalgo, growing corn, beans, wheat, onions, tomatoes, cactus fruit, and peaches; the valley also produces one-quarter of all green chili peppers grown in Mexico. It also produces alfalfa, principally used to feed the area's cattle. A small but important quantity of lettuce, cabbage, cilantro, radishes, carrots, spinach, and parsley is grown. There are also a number of fish farms, especially in Tezontepec de Aldama. About 61% of the population works in agriculture, which has been made possible by the diversion of wastewater from the neighboring Valley of Mexico through the Tula River. Sixty percent of the farmland is irrigated with wastewater. Thirty nine percent of the farmland is dependent on clean water sources such as wells and rain, and only 0.38 percent is irrigated with treated water. The areas most dependent on wastewater are: Actopan, Ajacuba, Alfajayucan, Atitalaquía, Atotonilco de Tula, Francisco I. Madero, Chilcuautla, Mixquihuala, San Salvador, Tasquillo, Tetepango, Tezontepec, Tlahuelilpan, and Tlaxcoapan. The areas that use wastewater are more productive, as the water contains phosphorus and nitrogen, but the products are more likely to have problems with contaminants. These contaminants also pose a risk to farm workers and their families. Economic development includes industry especially in the south. Tula has a major oil refinery as well as an electrical plant. Fabric is woven in Tepeji, cement in Cruz Azul, Atotonilco. and Huichapan. Ixmiquipan and Actopan are important regional commercial centers. Traditional handcrafts include items made from ixtle fiber, baskets, weaving, pottery, and wood items. There are water parks and hiking areas in the mountain areas, which mostly attract families from the state of Hidalgo. These include El Xicuco (between Tula and Tlahuililpan), El Hualtepec (near Huichapan), and Los Frailes (near Actopan). History Image of Toltec ruler in relief from the Tula archeological site The valley has been populated at least since the Mesoamerican period, especially in the south around what is now Tula. It is considered to be the northern edge of Mesoamerica, with evidence of agriculture on terraces and some irrigation, at least in Tula, as well as hunter-gatherer communities. While there has been work on a number of sites, many have been damaged or destroyed by the irrigation works related to the Tula River, as well as areas in Ixmiquilpan, Actopan, Mixquiahuala, Tlahuililpan, and Ajacuba. In the Preclassic period, there were small settlements showing influence from Chupícuaro and Ticoman. The settlement of the northwest of the valley began in the Classic period by Xajay groups with possible Chupicuaro-Mixtlan connections. The southeast was settled by those affiliated with Teotihuacan, mostly in the Tula area. The most significant pre-Hispanic city was Tula, which came to regional prominence after the fall of Teotihuacan and before the rise of Tenochtitlan in the Valley of Mexico. It was the seat of the Toltec civilization, thought to have a mixed ethnic population, with a significant number of Otomis. The Toltec empire reached as far south as the Valley of Mexico and its influence has been found in artifacts as far away as the current U.S. Southwest. It is believed that aguamiel was first extracted around 1100 CE, which led to the making of pulque. The last Toltec ruler was Topilzin Ce-Acatl Quetzalcoatl, who came to power in 1085. Stories about Tula were an important part of Aztec lore, with the god Quetzalcoatl possibly a deification of the last Toltec ruler. While the Otomi presence is notable since the Epiclassic period, the valley became dominated by this ethnicity in the Postclassic period, when the rise of the Aztec Empire drove many southern Otomi into the valley. They have remained the dominant indigenous population to the present day. While the Aztecs held sway of much of the valley in the south, they never completely subjugated the Otomis, in part because of Otomi tendency to be nomadic. However, there was trade between the two peoples. Aztec records indicate that cotton was collected in part of the area as tribute, but this has been debated because of the area's dry climate. Only after the Spanish conquest did the Otomi of the valley become more settled, although to this day there are some fringe groups which still maintain much of the hunter-gatherer traditions. The Tula area was initially ruled for the Spanish by Pedro Miahuazochil in Tula and Pedro Rodríguez de Escobar in Ixmiquilpan. The ecology of the valley began to change dramatically in the colonial period, mostly due to logging and the introduction of grazing animals, especially sheep, causing erosion and other damage. During the Mexican War of Independence, insurgent forces under Ignacio López Rayón made camp to Ixmiquilpan and also defeated royalist forces in the nearby village of Tamaleras, now called López Rayón. In 1854 a local uprising, especially in the communities of Orizabita and Remedios, arose in response to the excessive taxes levied by Ixmiquilpan authorities. The protesters were led by Sotero Lozano, who was called a bandit. This leader was most active in the towns of Actopan and Cardonal, his hometown. The valley saw a number of battles during the Mexican Revolution, especially between those loyal to Venustiano Carranza and Emiliano Zapata. However, because of climate, the valley remained sparsely populated and very poor from the colonial period until the 20th century. In the early 20th century, a rail line was built to link the valley to Pachuca. The rail line was planned by Englishman Richard Honey, who came to Ixmiquilpan with his family to settle. The rail line was supposed to run from Pachuca to Tampico, Tamaulipas but it was built only as far as Ixmilquilpan. At this time efforts to divert water from the Tula River for irrigation began, with the Tecolote Dam built along with the El Morelos and El Moro Canals. Later the Capula Dam was built, along with another canal to bring wastewater in from the Valley of Mexico. In the 1940s the Mexico City/Laredo highway was built through the area, which gave the valley more connection with the outside world. In 1951, by presidential decree, the Patrimonio Indígena del Valle de Mezquital (Valley of Mezquital Indigenous Heritage) was created in Ixmiquilpan by President Miguel Alemán Valez and state governor D. Quintín Rueda Villagran to promote Mezquital Otomi culture and education. These and many other infrastructure and economic development projects have changed much of the valley's way of life, especially in Tula and Ixquimilpan. Today the valley is an important agricultural region for the state of Hidalgo, growing corn, beans, wheat, onions, tomatoes, cactus fruit, and peaches. It produces one-quarter of Mexico's green chili peppers. However, there are still problems with poverty, especially among the Otomis. From the 1980s, many Otomis migrated away from the valley to the United States, with large communities from this area settling in Clearwater, Florida and Las Vegas. However, in 2011, the head of the Otomi Supreme Council in Ixmiquilpan stated that migration to the US from the area's Otomi had diminished, principally due to the US's poor economy. The valley has also had recurring conflicts over land and water resources, especially in Cardonal, Ixmiquilpan, and Tasquillo. The disputes have resulted in numerous protests and affected local elections. While the situation is not as dire as in various municipalities in the state of Guerrero, there have been reports of armed groups in the valley. These exist generally to protect a certain segment of the population rather than an entire community. These groups have been influenced by events in Guerrero since the 1990s, especially by the Popular Revolutionary Front. However, violent conflicts go back further than this. One major dispute is over 102 hectares of land on the border between Ixmiquilpan and El Cardonal, which has led to paramilitary groups taking over areas. Important locations=Population centers= Main plaza of Ixmiquilpan The town of Ixmiquilpan is the center of the Mezquital Valley, especially its Otomi population. The center of this town is its parish church, named after the Archangel Michael. It is noted for its large series of murals done in the 16th century by native artists depicting Eagle and Jaguar warriors in battle, along with other pre-Hispanic imagery. This parish church is typical of the fortress-style churches built by the Augustinians in the 16th century. The facade is Plateresque style with paired columns and with a window in the choir area. The bell tower is annexed and joined with the facade. It has a crown and bell gables. Imagery that is repeated here is that of holy war with Eagle and Jaguar warriors, as well as images associated with the sun and moon gods. The Jaguar and Eagle warriors were some of the armies that the Spanish fought during the Conquest; they wore resplendent apparel. Few explicit pictorial references to these warriors were permitted afterwards. The murals at Ixmiquilpan are an exception. The murals here appear in a series of polychrome frescos, which have structure in a large and coherent way. The parish church was declared a national monument in 1933. Facade of the parish and former monastery of San José The city of Tula de Allende was built on what was the southern extension of the ancient city of Tula, centered on a former monastery built by the Spanish in the 16th century. The modern city is still connected to the ancient ruins, as it is an important tourist attraction as well as a symbol of the city, especially the warrior figures located on the Quetzalcoatl pyramid. The modern city is a regional economic center and has been listed as one of the fastest growing in Mexico by the National Commission of Population. Much of the reason for this is the existence of a refinery and a thermoelectric plant. The city is centered around the parish and former monastery of San Jose, with the oldest part built between 1546 and 1556. The main facade has three arches, pilasters with reliefs, a curved pediment, and a chapel annex that takes from the 17th century. The cloister of the monastery has two levels with arches and fresco murals. Inside the main church, a modern mural called \\"Jesus\\" is located at the main altar. It was named a cathedral in 1961. =Archeological sites= Warrior statue/columns at the Tula archeological site The most important archeological site of the valley is Tula, although this is overshadowed by its predecessor Teotihuacan and one of its successors, Tenochtitlan. Much of the site's historical importance comes from the fact that its civilization was highly respected by the Aztecs who followed - the Aztecs used the terms \\"Tula\\" and \\"Toltec\\" to indicate an urban space and a skilled person, respectively. The modern archaeological site consists of the ceremonial center of Tula Grande, an area called Tula Chico, the Jorge R. Acosta site museum, and the Guadalupe Mastache orientation center. The ceremonial center of the city is located on a limestone outcropping, with steep banks on three sides, making it defensible. War and sacrifice are prominent themes at the site, with images representing warriors such as jaguars and coyotes, as well as eagles eating human hearts. There are also images of serpents eating skeletal figures and skulls in various areas. The major attraction of the site is Pyramid B, also called the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl or of the Morning Star. It is a five-tiered structure similar to the Temple of the Warriors at Chichen Itza. At the top of Pyramid B are four massive columns, each carved in the likeness of Toltec warriors which once supported the roof of the temple on top of the pyramid. Each warrior figure is of basalt, high, with an atlatl or spear thrower, incense, a butterfly-shaped chest plate, and a back plate in the shape of a solar disk. Another important site is Pañhú, located in the community of La Mesilla in the municipality of Tecozautla. It is a Classic period city which coexisted along with Teotihuacan. However, its architecture is different from that of the larger city, especially the substructure of the main pyramid which is unlike any other in Mesoamerica. This probably means that it was at least semi-autonomous from Teotihuacan. The archeological site was opened to the public in 2012.

First announced and released at the 1998 USENIX LISA conference, Ganymede has been under public development and use since then. Ganymede uses a central server which supports clients connecting via Java RMI. The Ganymede server maintains a transactional object graph database of network information such as user objects, group objects, system objects, network objects, etc. Users and administrators run Ganymede clients (GUI or XML based) to create, modify, or delete objects in the database. Whenever a user commits a transaction, the Ganymede server schedules a number of background threads to write out updated network source files and run whatever system scripts are required to propagate the new data into the managed network directory services. If multiple users are working concurrently, the scheduler makes sure that the entire network environment is updated with transactionally consistent directory images as builds finish and new ones are issued. The Ganymede server is meant to be programmed by the adopter, who can define arbitrary object data types along with custom logic to interact with the user through the GUI and to maintain consistency within and between objects. Adopters can also create custom tasks which can be executed at specified times by the internal Ganymede scheduler. Such custom tasks can make changes in the server's object database and/or can run external scripts to update external services. Ganymede has an elaborate XML data format which can be used to import and export the server's object database schema and object data. Importing XML will typically result in the creation, modification, or deletion of database objects, and will trigger one or more network directory service rebuilds just as using the GUI client would do. Above all, Ganymede is designed around administration teams. Administrators are members of 'Owner Groups', which own objects. Any object that is changed by a user or an automated task can result in change report email being sent to administrators in the appropriate Owner Group, making it possible for admins to keep up to date with changes that others in their groups are making.

In a racing career which lasted from 1824 until 1828 he ran fifteen times and won nine races. Bred and originally trained in Yorkshire, he was unbeaten in two races as two-year-old in 1824, including the Champagne Stakes and won the York version of the St Leger the following spring. In the St Leger at Doncaster in September 1825, he was successful as the heavily backed favourite in a record field of thirty runners. Memnon was later trained at Newmarket and recorded his most important subsequent victory when winning the Ascot Gold Cup as a five-year-old in 1827. After standing as a breeding stallion for five years in England with moderate results, he was sold and exported to Russia. Background Memnon was a \\"long, loose, big and leggy\\" bay horse with one white foot bred at Bishop Burton in Yorkshire by Richard Watt. Memnon was sired by the Duke of Grafton's horse Whisker who won the 1815 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful breeding stallion. His dam Manuella, who was also bred by Richard Watt, won The Oaks in 1812 and retired from racing to become a broodmare at Watt's stud. Apart from Memnon, she produced the successful racehorses Belzoni and Belshazar, as well as the influential broodmare Margellina. Racing career=1824: two-year-old season= Memnon made his first racecourse appearance on 18 September at the St Leger meeting at Doncaster Racecourse. He started the 4/5 favourite for the second running of the Champagne Stakes, one of the year's most important races for two-year-olds. Ridden by Bill Scott, he won from Lord Queensberry's colt The Alderman and two others. Five days later he faced twelve opponents in a sweepstakes over the same course and distance. Memnon won at odds of 5/1, with The Alderman again taking second place. =1825: three-year-old season= 'Memnon', the Winner of the Great St. Leger at Doncaster, 1825 by John Frederick Herring, Sr. Memnon made his first appearance of the season at York Racecourse on 9 May when he contested a \\"St Leger Stakes\\". The success of the St Leger at Doncaster had led other major courses, including York and Newmarket to use the name for their own long distance races for three-year-olds; the original race was renamed the \\"Great St Leger\\" for several years to distinguish itself from the imitators. Memnon started 4/6 favourite for the York race, and won from Lord Kelburne's colt Dare Devil. After a break of more than four months, Memnon returned for the fiftieth running of the Great St Leger at Doncaster on 20 September. Ridden as usual by Bill Scott, he started the 3/1 favourite against twenty-nine colts and fillies, the largest field assembled for the classic up to that time. Memnon won the race easily by three lengths from his old rival The Alderman. The beaten horses included a filly named Fleur de Lis who was reportedly \\"thrown down\\" during the race. Betting on the race had been heavy and among the winners were Robert Ridsdale and John Gully, who reportedly won £31,000 and £16,000 respectively on the result. By the time he appeared in the Gascoigne Stakes two days later Memnon had been sold by Watt for 3,500 guineas to Lord Darlington, later to become the 1st Duke of Cleveland. The colt won the prize for his new owner without having to race as the other eight entries were withdrawn, allowing him to walk over. =1826: four-year-old season= Memnon's third season began when he ran in the Gold Cup at Manchester Racecourse in Lancashire on 18 May. He started odds-on favourite against three opponents, but lost his undefeated record as he was beaten by a filly named Signorina. Memnon returned to Yorkshire in August for the four-year-old division of the Great Subscription Purse. He was made 2/7 favourite, but was defeated by his only opponent, Lord Kelburne's colt Actaeon. A year after his classic win, Memnon appeared at Doncaster in September, but avoided potential clashes with Fleur-de-Lis and Actaeon in the Doncaster Stakes and Doncaster Cup as a result of some \\"blundering\\" with his entries. Instead, he walked over for a sweepstakes over the St Leger course on 20 September and won a four-mile event on the following afternoon. In the latter race he defeated the five- year-old Florismart by half a head after a \\"beautiful and severe race\\". =1827: five-year-old season= For the 1827 season, Memnon was moved south to be trained at Newmarket by William Chifney, and was ridden in most of his subsequent races by his new trainer's brother Samuel Chifney, Jr.. On 15 May at Newmarket Racecourse, Memnon made his five-year-old debut in a 1,000 guinea match race over ten furlongs in which he easily defeated Lord Exeter's Enamel, the winner of the 1822 2000 Guineas. A month later, Memnon appeared at Ascot Racecourse where he contested the twenty-first running of the Gold Cup. Ridden by Sam Chifney, he started 1/2 favourite for the two and a half mile race and won impressively by two lengths from King George IV's horse Mortgage and three others. In autumn, Memnon appeared at the Doncaster St Leger meeting for the fourth year in succession, but on this occasion, he failed to win a race. On 18 September he lost by a neck to Fleur-de-Lis at level weights in the two- mile Doncaster Stakes. Two days later he started second favourite for the Doncaster Cup over two miles five furlongs against a field which included Fleur-de-Lis, Actaeon and the 1826 St Leger winner Tarrare. He dead-heated with Fleur-de-Lis for second place behind Lord Fitzwilliam's four-year-old Mulatto. Memnon was scheduled to run a three-mile match race against The Alderman at Newmarket in October, but his opponent failed to appear, leaving Lord Darlington to collect a 250 guineas forfeit. =1828: six-year-old season= Memnon remained in training as a six-year-old but failed to show any worthwhile form. In April he finished last of the five runners when carrying top weight of 128 pounds in the two-mile Oatlands Stakes at Newmarket, and a month later finished third of four behind Chateau Margaux in the Jockey Club Plate over the four-mile Beacon Course. In October Memnon was scheduled to challenge for The Whip, a silver trophy which was said to incorporate hairs from the tail and mane of Eclipse, but he failed to appear for the race, allowing Colonel Wilson's Lamplighter to claim the prize. Stud career Memnon was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Lord Cleveland's stud at Raby Castle. By 1831 he was standing at a fee of 10 guineas a mare at J Painter's stables at Dean's Hill, Staffordshire. The most successful of his British offspring was King Cole, who won the Chester Cup in 1838. In 1833 he was sold and exported to Russia. Pedigree * Memnon was inbred 3 × 3 to Potoooooooo, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree. He was also inbred 4 × 4 × 4 to Eclipse and 4 × 4 to Highflyer.

There are no prostitution laws on the islands except for those concerning trafficking and child prostitution. UNAIDS estimate there are 1,400 prostitutes in Cape Verde, many were from Ghana and Senegal before being expelled by the police. Some turn to prostitution through poverty. Sex tourism, including child sex tourism, is a major occurrence in Cape Verde, especially in Santa Maria and the tourist beach resorts on the Cape Verdian island of Sal. The islands are also a destination for female sex tourism. Sex trafficking, and child prostitution are problems on the islands. Sex trafficking Cabe Verde is primarily a source country for children subjected to sex trafficking within the country and a destination for women in forced prostitution. Boys and girls, some of whom may be foreign nationals, are exploited in sex trafficking in Santa Maria, Praia, and Mindelo, sometimes through child sex tourism. Increasing numbers of West African women have been identified in forced prostitution, including on Boa Vista and Sal Islands and sometimes through sex tourism. Children living in impoverished neighbourhoods with little state presence are also at risk, especially for sex trafficking. West African migrants may transit the archipelago en route to situations of exploitation in Europe. Some adult migrants from China and ECOWAS countries may receive low wages, work without contracts, and have irregular status, rendering them vulnerable to sex trafficking. In 2016, the government increased anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts, but gaps remained. The penal code appears to prohibit all forms of trafficking in persons. Article 271 criminalises slavery and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties of six to 12 years' imprisonment. Article 271-A makes it a crime to use force, fraud, or coercion for the purposes of sexual or labour exploitation and prescribes penalties of four to 10 years' imprisonment. When the victim is a minor, an undefined term which elsewhere in the criminal code is defined at 16, the penalty increases to six to 12 years' imprisonment. In addition to article 271-A, article 148 of the criminal code outlaws the promotion, encouragement, or facilitation of prostitution and sexual acts with minors younger than 16 years of age or persons suffering from mental incapacity with penalties of four to 10 years' imprisonment, or two to six years' imprisonment if the victim is between ages 16 and 18. Article 149 of the penal code punishes those who entice, transport, host, or receive children younger than 16 years of age or promote the conditions for sexual acts or prostitution in a foreign country with two to eight years' imprisonment.

UNAIDS estimates there are 1,200 prostitutes in the country. Many are from Cameroon. Allegations of sexual misconduct by Oxfam staff In February 2018 an investigation by The Times newspaper found that Oxfam allowed three men to resign and sacked four for gross misconduct after an inquiry concerning sexual exploitation, the downloading of pornography, bullying and intimidation. A confidential report produced by Oxfam in 2011 found that there had been “a culture of impunity” among some staff in Haiti and concluded that 'it cannot be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged'. Among the staff who were permitted to resign was the charity's Belgian country director, Roland Van Hauwermeiren. According to the internal report, Van Hauwermeiren admitted using prostitutes at a villa whose rent was paid for by Oxfam with charitable funds. Oxfam's chief executive at the time, Dame Barbara Stocking, offered Hauwermeiren “a phased and dignified exit” because of concern that sacking him risked “potentially serious implications” for the charity's work and reputation. A few days after The Times published its revelations, it emerged that Oxfam had been aware of allegations that, while serving as director of the organisation's relief operation in Chad in 2006, Van Hauwermeiren and other staff had repeatedly made use of prostitutes at the Oxfam team house there, and that one of Oxfam's staff members had been fired for his behaviour. In the wake of these revelations, Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned, taking full responsibility and acknowledging that \\"(c)oncerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon\\". New allegations were made by a senior staffer, Helen Evans, who had been the lead investigator of organizational sexual misconduct between 2012 and 2015.Smout, Alistair. (13 February 2018). \\"UK's Oxfam hit by new report of sex abuse by aid workers.\\" Reuters website Retrieved 13 February 2018. HIV Like many Sub-Saharan African countries, HIV is a problem in Chad. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups. Lack of understanding of the infection, low usage of condoms and poor access to healthcare contribute to a HIV prevalence rate of 20%. This figure is likely to be higher in the Lake Chad area. Sex trafficking Chad is a source, transit, and destination country for children subjected to sex trafficking. The country's trafficking problem is primarily internal and frequently involves children being entrusted to relatives or intermediaries in return for promises of education, apprenticeship, goods, or money. Chadian girls travel to larger towns in search of work, where some are subsequently subjected to child sex trafficking or are abused in domestic servitude; child sex trafficking is also a concern among refugees and IDPs in Chad. NGOs report that the Nigerian terrorist groups Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State-West Africa are involved in child trafficking. In the Lake Chad area, since May 2015, attacks by Boko Haram and concurrent government military operations increased the number of IDPs, a population vulnerable to trafficking, to 76,225. In 2015, authorities arrested the police commissioner of the city of Kelo on suspicion of involvement in child trafficking; however, after initial investigation for kidnapping, officials released the suspect from custody and, while the case remained open, it was unknown whether officials continued to actively investigate the charge. In 2016, the Chadian National Police Child Protective Services (Brigade des Mineurs) continued to investigate child abuse and exploitation, including trafficking. NGOs reported of some local officials’ complicity in trafficking during 2016.

The dish is typically prepared with biscuits or crackers, cocoa, butter, sugar and solidified milk. History In 1888, production of chocolate and other products arrived to Kaunas, situated in the south-centre of Lithuania. Due to this, artisans started to elaborate upon new recipes with chocolate, such as chocolate and biscuits and chocolate with raisins or hazelnuts. In Lithuania different types of hazelnuts are available because there are a great variety of forests, so they are used frequently. Lithuanians also began to make cognac sweetened with chocolate and created new liquors that utilized chocolate. More elaborate recipes were created, such as the sweet called \\"tinginys,\\" which means \\"lazy\\". In 1967 a woman accidentally created the recipe; she tried to cook chocolate but added too much sugar, which liquefied the mixture into a syrup. To remedy this, the woman tried to make the savour less strong by adding some biscuits, so she broke them into pieces, mixed them with the syrup and when it cooled, the first Tinginys was created. Later modifications occurred, such as letting the mixture cool down and rolling it on a plastic bag, and then cutting it into pieces. People decided to call it \\"lazy\\" because it was very easy and quick to prepare. In contemporary times Today, tinginys is sometimes produced using less expensive ingredients and with even easier methods.

The film's script was adapted from the Bluntman And Chronic comic book story originally written by Smith as a companion piece to his 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Plot After winning $10,000,000 from a scratchcard they bought at the Quick Stop, Jay & Silent Bob decide to become superheroes Bluntman and Chronic (a parody of Batman and Robin). They build a secret Fortress of Solitude beneath RST Video and acquire all the necessary gadgets and accessories to make them ideal crime-fighters. They also hire their own butler, Albert (a parody of Alfred Pennyworth). Throughout their crime- fighting ordeals, they manage to accidentally create a few super-powered enemies of their own, who together form \\"The League of Shitters\\". The League of Shitters consists of Lipstick Lesbian, Dickhead, NewsGroup, Cocknocker, and the Diddler. While at a ceremony in which Bluntman and Chronic are to be awarded the key to the city of Red Bank, The League of Shitters attack the dynamic duo and knock them unconscious. They then attempt to infiltrate the \\"Bluntcave\\", resulting in the deaths of NewsGroup and Diddler (they are crushed by a wall that reveals the entrance to the hideout). Lipstick Lesbian mortally stabs Albert in the back and places Bluntman and Chronic into a giant bong that is slowly filling up with water. After leaving the heroes to die, the villains descend upon Red Bank, killing everyone in their path. Albert uses the last of his strength to free the heroes before dying. Vowing to avenge Albert, Bluntman and Chronic fly to Red Bank in the Blunt Jet to save the city from The League of Shitters' mayhem. An epic fight ensues in which Bluntman subdues Dickhead by tricking him into entering a gay bar and Chronic kills Cocknocker with a broken beer bottle. Lipstick Lesbian draws a gun and attempts to shoot Bluntman and Chronic, but they are miraculously saved by a new heroine, Bluntgirl. Bluntgirl defeats Lipstick Lesbian single-handedly and begins to show romantic interest in Bluntman. Chronic is jealous and expresses his desire for anal sex. Bluntgirl agrees to this, however, she penetrates Chronic with a dildo, much to Chronic's distaste. Bluntgirl asks Bluntman if he's ever experienced anything of the like, to which he replies, \\"Yeah, when Ben Affleck played Daredevil.\\". During the credits, it is noted that \\"Jay and Silent Bob will return in Clerks III.\\" After the credits, Jay and Silent Bob are visited by Stan Lee, who wishes to speak to them about the \\"Avenger Initiative\\". Shortly after, they are all picked up by Doc Brown, who requests their help in getting back to the future.

Sex trafficking Djibouti is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking, although limited data on trafficking cases has complicated efforts to determine the full scope of the phenomenon. Men, women, and children, primarily from Ethiopia and Somalia, and to a lesser extent from Eritrea, transit Djibouti voluntarily en route to Yemen and other locations in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, to seek work. An unknown number of these migrants are subjected to sex trafficking in their intended destinations. Djiboutian and migrant women and street children are vulnerable to sex trafficking in Djibouti City, the Ethiopia-Djibouti trucking corridor, and Obock, the main departure point for Yemen. Some migrants intending to be smuggled may be transported or detained against their will and subsequently subjected to trafficking and other forms of abuse in Djibouti. Some migrant women reportedly were subjected to domestic servitude and forced prostitution in Djibouti. The 2016 Law No. 133, On the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons and Illicit Smuggling of Migrants, criminalizes all forms of trafficking; it prescribes penalties of five to 10 years imprisonment, and 20 when aggravating factors are present, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those for other serious crime. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Djibouti as a 'Tier 2' country.

She debuted for Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (JWP) in November 1991 and worked for its follow-up promotion JWP Joshi Puroresu from 1992 until its folding in 2017, also serving as its final president. During her years in JWP, Bolshoi became a two-time JWP Openweight Champion, seven-time JWP Tag Team Champion and a four-time Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Champion. Bolshoi has worked under mask for a majority of her career and has managed to keep her real name and birthdate secret. Professional wrestling career=JWP Joshi Puroresu (1991–2017)= After spending two years training at the JWP Dojo, Bolshoi made her professional wrestling debut for the Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (JWP) promotion on November 26, 1991, teaming with Mami Kitamura in a tag team match, where the two faced Hikari Fukuoka and Reiko Hoshino. Originally she worked under a clown mask and the ring name \\"Bolshoi Kid\\", named after the Russian Bolshoi Circus. The following year, after the original JWP folded, she began working for its follow-up promotion, JWP Joshi Puroresu, reinventing herself as \\"Command Bolshoi\\" in the process, though still disguising herself under a mask. To this day, she continues to occasionally work under her Bolshoi Kid persona. After Cutie Suzuki, Devil Masami, Dynamite Kansai and Mayumi Ozaki all quit JWP, Bolshoi became the promotion's new president, while also becoming a trainer at the promotion's dojo. Bolshoi won her first title in JWP in 1999, when she and Rieko Amano won the JWP Tag Team Championship. The following year on August 6, Bolshoi defeated Ran Yu-Yu to win JWP's top title, the JWP Openweight Championship. After a seven-month reign, she lost the title to Azumi Hyuga. During the next year, Bolshoi went on to win the JWP Tag Team Championship two more times with Azumi Hyuga and Gami. From July 2002 to April 2009, Bolshoi went completely without any titles, before she and Megumi Yabushita defeated Keito and Yumiko Hotta for not only the JWP Tag Team Championship, but also the Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Championship. Bolshoi in June 2010 In 2010, Bolshoi made several appearances for the Ice Ribbon promotion, defeating Hikari Minami on August 27 to win the promotion's top title, the ICE×60 Championship. After a four-month reign, she lost the title to Tsukasa Fujimoto on December 26. In December 2011, Bolshoi was scheduled to make her American debut with the Chikara promotion, but was forced to pull out at the last minute due to an injury. She eventually made her debut for the promotion the following September, when she, Kaori Yoneyama and Tsubasa Kuragaki made it to the second round of the 2012 King of Trios. Bolshoi's 2012 was highlighted by her and JWP's storyline rivalry with the Heart Move Kei Reform (HMK) stable, which led to her and Arisa Nakajima winning the Daily Sports Women's Tag Team and JWP Tag Team Championships from HMK members Emi Sakura and Kaori Yoneyama in August 2012. Bolshoi's part in the rivalry culminated at the end of the year event on December 24, where Bolshoi defeated Yoneyama in a grudge match. In June 2013, Bolshoi announced the \\"Bolshoi Decade\\" series, where she would face all other JWP wrestlers in singles matches in order to assess their abilities. As part of the series, Bolshoi defeated Leon on July 20 to win the CMLL-Reina International Championship. After a reign of only eight days, Bolshoi lost the title to Arisa Nakajima in the next match in the Bolshoi Decade series; a double title match, contested also for the JWP Openweight Championship. On May 4, 2014, Bolshoi and Kyoko Kimura defeated Rabbit Miu and Tsukushi in a decision match to become the new Daily Sports Women's Tag Team and JWP Tag Team Champions. They held the titles for the rest of the year, losing them to Leon and Ray on December 28, 2014. On July 11, 2015, Bolshoi defeated Kayoko Haruyama to win the JWP Openweight Championship for the second time, fifteen years after winning it the first time. She lost the title to Mayumi Ozaki in her first defense on August 16. In September 2016, Bolshoi returned to the United States and Chikara to represent JWP in the 2016 King of Trios, alongside Hanako Nakamori and Manami Katsu. The team made it to the finals of the tournament before losing to their compatriots, Team Sendai Girls (Cassandra Miyagi, Dash Chisako and Meiko Satomura). On January 9, 2017, Bolshoi and Leon defeated Hanako Nakamori and Kyoko Kimura to win the Daily Sports Women's Tag Team and JWP Tag Team Championships. On February 8, it was announced that JWP would be folding on April 2, after which Bolshoi is scheduled to launch a new promotion on August 11. The following month, it was announced that the new promotion would be called \\"Pure-J\\". At JWP's final show on April 2, 2017, Bolshoi and Leon successfully defended the Daily Sports Women's Tag Team and JWP Tag Team Championships against Kazuki and Rydeen Hagane. Afterwards, the JWP title was retired, while the Daily Sports title moves on to Pure-J with the champions. =Pure-J (2017–2019)= Before the official launch of Pure-J on August 11, 2017, the former JWP roster presented shows under the name \\"Pure-Dream Presents Dream Joshi Puroresu\\". Bolshoi and Leon continued defending the Daily Sports Women's Tag Team Championship at these shows. During these shows, the two also named their team \\"P-Ray-L\\", in reference to Ray, who was battling cancer. The name, which includes the letters \\"P\\" and \\"L\\" for \\"Piko\\" and \\"Leon\\", was also a play on the word \\"prayer\\". At Pure-J's inaugural event on August 11, Bolshoi defeated Konami. On August 21, 2018, Bolshoi announced that due to the progressive worsening of the yellow ligament ossification in her spine, that she would be retiring in 2019, with her retirement show set at Korakuen Hall on April 21. Bodybuilding On May 31, 2015, Bolshoi took part in NPCJ's Blaze Open bodybuilding competition, where she finished third in the women's athlete category, beating fellow professional wrestler Meiko Satomura, who finished fourth. Bolshoi, however, won the Overall Best Performance Award, which was voted by 50 randomly picked members of the audience. On October 24, 2015, Bolshoi won the NPCJ Beef Sasaki Classic's figure category and was also chosen as the tournament's MVP across all categories.

McKendry was then elected the first Mayor of Marlborough and served for two terms (1989–1995). Early in the campaign for the 2010 local election, he stated that past mayors should not stand again as councillors, saying, \\"I've just always believed it was an unwritten rule once you were defeated or retired, it was time to go completely\\". Subsequently, Liz Davidson, Gerald Hope, and Tom Harrison, the three mayors who succeeded him, all failed to get re-elected as councillors.

He served as the first minister of foreign affairs of Autonomous Mongolia in the government of the Bogd Khan from 1911 to 1913 and founded the nation's diplomatic service. He died, allegedly poisoned, in 1915. Khanddorj was born in 1869 in present-day Bulgan Province, the grandson of Tserendorj, military governor of Tüsheet Khan Province. Khanddorj became assistant military governor of the province at age 21 in 1892 and then full commander from 1897 to 1900. Growing up in an enlightened aristocratic family, he studied Old Mongolian, Manchu and Chinese languages and later mastered some Russian. In 1904, Khanddorj invited the 13th Dalai Lama to stay at his residence the Wang Monastery (present-day Bulgan city) as the Tibetan spiritual leader crossed Mongolia to seek Russian support against the British following Francis Younghusband's British expedition to Tibet. The Dalai Lama was later accompanied on his journey to Beijing by Khanddorj's son Danzanjamts (Данзанжамц), who was subsequently executed by Qing authorities for violating protocol. Khanddorj's resentment of Manchu rule in Outer Mongolia intensified. In 1910 Khanddorj was invited to Ikh Khüree to become an advisor to the Khalkha Mongol Buddhist spiritual leader the 8th Bodg Gegeen Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. Dissatisfied with Beijing's \\"New Administration Policy\\" on governing Mongolia, Mongolia's spiritual leader the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu and several noble princes including Khanddorj, Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren, Da Lam Tserenchimed and others discussed the possibility of independence in earnest and in the summer of 1911 met in a secret congress to plot further strategy. The Khutuktu was persuaded to send a delegation headed by Khanddorj to Russia to seek assistance. In Saint Petersburg Khanddorj asked for Russia's help, to include the provision of arms, in protecting Mongolia's fledgling independence against Chinese incursions, and implied that Russian troops would be needed against a Chinese unit which the Mongolians believed was at that moment advancing into Mongolia. The Russian government decided to support, by diplomatic rather than by military means, not full independence for Mongolia, but autonomy within the Qing empire. As the Qing dynasty began to collapse in the fall of 1911 following the uprising in Wuchang, Mongol officials moved to fill the vacuum. On December 1, the Provisional Government of Khalkha issued a general proclamation announcing the end of Qing rule and the establishment of a theocracy under the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. In the new independent government, Khanddorj was appointed minister of foreign affairs but an internal power struggle erupted almost immediately between Khanddorj and Minister of Internal Affairs Da Lam Tserenchimed over whose ministry would hold more prestige. At the end of 1912 Khanddorj headed another delegation to St. Petersburg, this time to secure diplomatic relations between the newly independent Mongolia and the Russian Empire which resulted in the 1912 Russian-Mongolian treaty. Khanddorj was a strong Russophile and under his initiative the School of Russian Translators was opened in Urga in 1912. However, he was distrusted by a number of high officials in the Bogd Khan's government, especially Gonchigjalzangiin Badamdorj, minister of religion and state, who complained to the Bogd Khan about Khanddorj's alleged treasonable inclinations. As a result, in 1913 Khanddorj was removed as head of the Foreign Ministry and was not a member of the government delegation at the Treaty of Kyakhta conference in 1915. Soon after, Khanddorj was allegedly assassinated, dying of poisoning after attending a reception at the Bogd Khan's residence.

Biography  Rashko was born in the region of Old Herzegovina, like Tešan Podrugović, but later moved to Kolašin. According to some theories, he was probably a brother of Marko, the grandfather of Svetozar Marković. At the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising, Rashko came to the village of Sabanta in the Jagodina nahiyah. He participated in the First Serbian Uprising and distinguished himself in the Battle of Lipar (1804), in which he raised the revolutionary flag, and the Battle of Deligrad (1806).  Songs  Old Rashko was illiterate. Based on his singing, Vuk Karadžić recorded some of the best poems with motifs derived from medieval Serbian history, like The Building of Skadar or Uroš and the Sons of Marnyava. Jacob Grimm was particularly enthralled by The Building of Skadar and described it as \\"one of the most touching poems of all nations and all times\\". He was also the source of the songs Four Uskoks, The Building of Ravanica and The Maiden Margita and Duke Rajko. Vuk Karadžić stated that the song Battle of Deligrad was probably authored by Rashko himself. Vuk Karadžić also recorded another version of the song The Marriage of King Vukašin from Rashko, but it was not published as he probably considered it worse than the other versions. In a letter Vuk wrote to Miloš Obrenović he stated that he failed to record two beautiful songs from Rashko's singning: The Wedding of Ivo Senjanin and Three Prisoners. Miloš knew Raško personally, otherwise Vuk would not write about him in such manner. Vuk classified Rashko's songs into songs from Herzegovina, and this classification caused polemics between Svetozar Matić who believed that his songs were originally from Srem, although Raško had actually never visited Srem, and some other scholars who confirmed Vuk's opinion. In his songs Rashko paid much attention to ethics, being almost obsessed with righteousness, loyalty, and disloyalty. Vuk Karadžić recorded and published ten songs from Rashko's singing. * The Building of Skadar (Зидање Скадра) * The Building of Ravanica (Зидање Раванице) * The Death of Dušan * The Emperor Suleyman and Savo Patriarch * Uroš and the Sons of Marnyava (Урош и Мрњавчевићи) * Four Uskoks (Четири ускока) * Battle of Deligrad - probably authored by Rashko * The Maiden Margita and Duke Rajko (Маргита девојка и Рајко Војвода) * The Wedding of Prince Lazar * The Wedding of Grujica Novaković * The Marriage of King Vukašin - recorded but not published version See also * List of Serbian Revolutionaries *Dimitrije Karaman *Živana Antonijević *Filip Višnjić *Tešan Podrugović *Petar Perunović *Djuro Milutinović the Blind *Marko Utvić *Blind Jeca (Jelisaveta Marković, called \\"Blind Jeca,\\" was Živana's pupil) *Stepanija  References  18th- century Serbian people 19th-century Serbian people Serbian guslars Serbian male poets People of the First Serbian Uprising Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina People from Kolašin ","title":"Old Rashko"},{"id":"38679248","text":"Mystic Chronicles is a Japanese role-playing video game developed by Kemco. While initially released as Fantasy Chronicles for the iOS, the name was retitled as a result of Natsume providing a new English translation for its release on the PlayStation Portable, released in North America on July 16, 2013. Gameplay The game plays as a traditional Japanese role-playing video game. In the game, the player navigates a character through a fantasy world, interacting with non-playable characters and fighting enemies. When engaging enemies, the game utilizes a turn based battle system reminiscent of ones found in the Dragon Quest series of games. Story The game stars a boy named Lux, who wishes to protect the village he grew up in, from external threats. Development Developer Kemco, while a prevalent maker of video games during the NES era of video games, eventually ceased releasing video games in North America as technology and graphics advanced. In the 2010s, however, they changed their focus to release smaller, retro based games for mobile phones. The game was originally released as Fantasy Chronicles for iOS. The game was eventually ported to the PlayStation Portable. In February 2013, Natsume announced they would be releasing the game under a new title, Mystic Chronicles, with a new translation, distancing it from its original release, which was criticized for its translation. The PSP release will also contain an additional storyline. The game is updated to be compatible with the PlayStation Vita on August 6, 2013.Morgan Haro, PlayStation Blog, 2013-07-16 Reception Touch Arcade gave the game a 3.5 out of 5 rating, praising the classic gameplay features such as the battle system and crafting, but criticizing the game for being tedious after extended play time, and for its poor English translation, something Natsume would later address with its complete re-translation with its PSP release.

It is based on the motif of human sacrifice.  Time and place  The events described in the poem allegedly occurred at the beginning of the 14th century. Jovan Tomić concluded that this song was created in the region near Skadar (now Shkodër), such as upper Albania, Montenegro, or the southwest part of Herzegovina where the tradition of the Mrnjavčević family was strong. His conclusion was later supported by other scholars. The army led by King Vukašin Mrnjavčević and his son Prince Marko came under Skadar in June 1371, but when they were informed about a large Ottoman army advancing from the east they headed east to prepare for the Battle of Maritsa. The same motif is described in poetry composed in some other languages. The version in Serbian is considered as the major South- Slavic version. It is the only version which exists in the form of an epic poem, while versions in Hungarian, Romanian and Bulgarian are ballads. The version of the song in the Serbian language recorded by Vuk Karadžić is the oldest collected version of the legend, and the first one which earned literary fame.  Publishing and initial reactions  This song was published for the first time in 1815 in a version recorded by Vuk Karadžić from the singing of a Herzegovinian storyteller named Old Rashko. In 1824, Vuk Karadžić sent a copy of his folksong collection to Jacob Grimm, who was particularly enthralled by The Building of Skadar. Grimm translated it into German, and described it as \\"one of the most touching poems of all nations and all times\\". Johann Wolfgang von Goethe published the German translation, but did not share Grimm's opinion because he found the poem's spirit \\"superstitiously barbaric\\".  Plot  The castle in Shkodër (Skadar) and Bojana river The song describes the building of a fortress on the Bojana river at Skadar by the Mrnjavčević brothers (Vukašin, Uglješa and Gojko Mrnjavčević). Gojko had to wall up his young wife alive within the walls of the fortress as a sacrifice demanded by the mountain vila (a fairy similar to a nymph, in Slavic mythology). According to Vuk Karadžić, there was a belief at this time that it was impossible to build a large building without a human sacrifice. Vuk claims that people even avoided the building sites because they were afraid their shadow could be walled-up and they could die without it.

Prostitution is common in Malian cities.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Mali. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (6 March 2007) UNAIDS estimate there to be 35,900 prostitutes in the country. Prostitution is on the rise, many having turned to prostitution because of poverty. In the capital, Bamako, many prostitutes are from Nigeria and other West African countries. In July and August there is an influx of students from various areas of West Africa who work as prostitutes during the summer vacation. There are also many Chinese bars in the country where prostitution occurs. It is estimated that the Chinese sex workers send 2 billion Cfa back to China annually. Many Nigerian prostitutes work in the area around the Morila Gold Mine. In early 2012, rebel and Islamic extremist groups occupied northern Mali prompting the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to be sent to the country. The influx of military personnel caused a rise in the demand for prostitution. In the Gao Region, prostitutes came from Burkina Faso, Niger, Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon came to the area to service the needs of the UN personnel. The cities of Bamako, Kayes, Ségou, Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao and Sikasso have a problem with teenage prostitution and sex tourism. Sex trafficking Mali is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking; women and girls from other West African countries, particularly Nigeria, are exploited in prostitution and sex trafficking throughout Mali. Nigerian authorities estimate more than 5,000 Nigerian girls are victims of sex trafficking in Mali. Some members of Mali's black Tuareg community are subjected to slavery practices rooted in traditional relationships of hereditary servitude and reports indicate it is worsening. Other Africans transiting Mali to Europe, primarily via Algeria and Libya and less so via Mauritania, are vulnerable to trafficking. Nigerian traffickers fraudulently recruit Nigerian women and girls with promises of taking them to Europe but exploit them in sex trafficking in Mali. Malian women and girls are victims of sex trafficking in Gabon, Libya, Lebanon, and Tunisia. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) investigated 23 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, including forced prostitution and sexual slavery, in Gao, Timbuktu, Kidal, and a refugee camp in Mauritania in 2016. MINUSMA investigated four members of GATIA, three members of the Mali Defense and Security Forces (MDSF), and civilians in these cases, although it did not report any prosecutions or convictions for trafficking offenses. Law 2012-023 Relating to the Combat against Trafficking in Persons and Similar Practices criminalizes all forms of trafficking of adults and children.

Its primary mission is tactical air transport and has the secondary mission of providing additional pilot training in multi-engine aircraft and in navigation, search and rescue, and general air transport.  History  The squadron dates back to 1937, when the then Portuguese Army's air arm (Aeronáutica Militar) was equipped with Junkers Ju 52/3m aircraft, with the creation of two bomber groups (Grupo de Bombardeamento de Dia and Grupo de Bombardeamento de Noite). In the 1940s these aircraft were distributed between Sintra Air Base (BA1) and Ota Air Base (BA2) and also assigned the transport role. The creation of the Portuguese Air Force brought major changes to the military aviation in Portugal and the creation of the Portuguese paratrooper units in the Air Force. One Ju 52 was then assigned to the paratroopers based at Tancos Air Base (BA3). On January 11, 1955, the Training and Liaison Flight (, ELT) was established with Captain Fernando Gomes dos Santos being appointed as its commander. This flight was equipped with 22 Piper L-21 aircraft, which also provided support to the Army's units, and two Airspeed Oxford for training. With the expanding of the missions assigned to the ELT it was decided to create a new squadron which would take on its missions and personnel. On April 12, 1956, the Esquadra Mista was created with two flights, one of liaison and training with the L-21 and Oxford aircraft, and a second of transport with five Ju 52. In December 1959 this squadron was disbanded thus resulting in the creation of the Heavy Aircraft Navigation and Complement Instruction Squadron (, EICPNAP), which was in fact used primary for parachute operations. On November and December 1960 France delivers 15 new Amiot AAC-1 (French built Ju 52) aircraft, with most of them being assigned to EICPNAP. In 1963, with the beginning of the Ultramar War, the Air Force increased the size of the parachute troops and started introducing new parachuting techniques. This led to the disbandment of the EICPNAP and to its replacement with the Parachute Troops Transport and Training Squadron (, ETTTP). The unit kept all the same infrastructures and resources of the former EICPNAP and adopted a turtle as its mascot, which was the nicknamed then given to the Ju 52. The ETTTP was then disbanded in 1971 and in its place 32 Squadron was created with the Nord Noratlas and until 1972 a few Ju 52 aircraft. With the adoption of the modern Noratlas, the squadrons missions expand from only parachute operations to general transport, including flights to Azores, Madeira, and the oversea territories. Later the Air Force Multi-engine School was reactivated in the squadron. With the end of the war the Noratlas continue to be operated by 32 Squadron until 1976. Between October and November 1974 the first CASA C-212-100 Aviocar started being delivered, with the last aircraft being delivered on April 9, 1976. The navigation and multi-engine aircraft instruction and training mission of 32 Squadron is then given to 111 Squadron, which also receives the helicopter instruction and training mission. In 1978, 32 Squadron is disbanded and 502 Squadron is established and equipped with the Aviocar. 502 Squadron also took over the Madeira Air Detachment (, DAM) at Madeira. From October 1988 to February 2008, the squadron also kept an detachment at São Tomé and Príncipe for medical evacuation between the islands and if necessary to the continent (to Gabon or to Ivory Coast), general air transport between São Tomé and Príncipe, air transport of the Portuguese embassy personnel, support of search and rescue missions. The detachment operated one Aviocar in a 24-hour alert, having flow 5,500 hours and having transported 50,000 passengers. In 2007, 711 Squadron, at Lajes Air Base (BA4) ends its operations with the Aviocar, handing over transport operations to 502 Squadron, which established the Azores Air Detachment (, DAA) At that same year the Air Force purchases 12 new EADS CASA C-295, seven of the transport variant (C-295M) and five in the maritime patrol variant (C-295MPA), to replace the Aviocar fleet. In 2009 the squadron is transferred from Sintra to the Montijo Air Base (BA6) and in February of that year the first C-295 was delivered. With the disbandment of the 401 Squadron \\"Cientistas\\" (Scientists) on December 6, 2011, the aerial photographic reconnaissance mission was then assigned to 502 Squadron.

He received academic tenure aged 28, making him the youngest tenured professor at the Wharton School.  Early life and education  Adam M. Grant was born in the township of West Bloomfield, Michigan on August 13, 1981 to a lawyer father and a teacher mother. He grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. Grant participated in springboard diving and aspired to be a professional basketball player growing up. During high school, he was named an All-American in 1999 in diving. He received a B.A. from Harvard College, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in organizational psychology. He worked as a professional magician during college. While in graduate school, he married his wife Allison; the couple has three children.  Academic career  Grant was hired by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to serve as an assistant professor for organizational behavior in 2007. After publishing several papers in academic journals, he was hired as an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, becoming the school's youngest tenured professor at age 28. He was ranked by students the best professor at the university from 2011 to 2017. In 2013, he wrote his first book, Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success. As his first published book on organizational psychology, it explored the dynamics behind collaboration, negotiation, and networking in business. The book went on to be translated in twenty-seven languages. Susan Dominus of The New York Times states that his book \\"incorporated scores of studies and personal case histories that suggest the benefits of an attitude of extreme giving at work.\\" In recognition for his work, Grant was named a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader and a Thinkers50 Most Influential Global Management Thinker in 2015. A year later his second book, Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, was published. This study looked at the benefits for pursuing artistic avocations, constantly improving rather than constantly innovating business practices, and the benefits of procrastination. The book became a New York Times bestseller and inspired a TED talk on the habits of original thinkers. Reviews of the book were mixed. While Scientific American praised Grant's work, The Guardian was more critical, commenting: \\"At times, Grant could be accused of straying off-topic, especially when he is dispensing advice. Children taught how their bad behaviour affects others develop a moral sensibility lacking in those who are merely admonished, he writes, without providing a clear link to the concept of originality.\\" He was named to Fortune's 40 under 40 the same year. In 2017, he co-authored his third book with Facebook Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sheryl Sandberg, Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy. The book focused on Grant's close relationship with his co-author and her resilience after her husband's sudden death at a Mexican resort. On August 8, 2017, a software engineer from Google, James Damore, published his controversial 10-page manifesto that argued that there were a range of reasons why men were the majority demographic at Google. Grant published a rebuff on LinkedIn which was featured on CNBC. In his rebuff, he outlined modern consensus among social scientists that believe there is \\"little to no\\" differences between the sexes in technical abilities.  Business  Adam Grant is the host of the WorkLife podcast. In 2017 Grant co-founded (along with University of Michigan Professor Wayne Baker and social scientist Cheryl Baker) Give and Take, Inc., a company that makes a software called Givitas, a web-based SaaS platform designed to help organizations implement the principles from his book Give and Take.

History The Vincentians arrived in the United States in 1816, among the first groups of Catholic clergy to serve in the then- missionary territory of the United States. Their first foundation was in Baltimore, Maryland. One goal of the Congregation since its founding has been the training of clergy, both for themselves and for the local diocese, at their own expense when necessary. Thus, after the establishment of an independent Province for the United States in 1835, the growing number of local bishops in the country began to request their help in running seminaries they had founded but did not have the means, either financially or in terms of manpower, to operate. In this way, members of the Congregation arrived in Philadelphia in 1841 at the invitation of Francis Patrick Kenrick, the Bishop of Philadelphia, to run St. Charles Borromeo Seminary. A part of Kenrick's invitation had been the offer to allow a house of formation for the Congregation to be opened in the diocese. The Vincentians served there until the appointment of the Superior of the school, Thaddeus Amat y Brusi, as the first Bishop of Los Angeles in 1852. At that point, dealing with their own shortage of personnel, and also being dissatisfied with the organization of the school under the bishop, they decided to withdraw from the seminary. In 1851 the Congregation had acquired land in Germantown Township, then still a rural suburb of Philadelphia, which was to become the center of their operations on the Eastern seaboard, and there opened the Parish of St. Vincent de Paul. In 1868 it was decided to move the formation program for new members of the Congregation from Missouri to Germantown.

Joy Morton needed to determine whether this was worthwhile and so consulted renowned mechanical engineer Charles Krum, who was vice president of the Western Cold Storage Company (which was run by Morton’s brother Mark Morton). Krum gave Joy Morton a positive response to the idea of helping Pearne, so space to set up a laboratory in the attic of Western Cold Storage was provided to Pearne. Pearne, after about a year of unsuccessful experiments, lost interest and left to get involved in teaching. Krum was prepared to continue Pearne’s work, and in August, 1903 a patent was filed for a ‘typebar page printer’ ( issued in May, 1908). In the following year, 1904 Krum filed a patent for a ‘type wheel printing telegraph machine’ which was issued in August, 1907. In 1906 Charles Krum's son, Howard Krum, graduated in electrical engineering and joined his father in this work.

Jumping libraries or junction-fragment libraries are collections of genomic DNA fragments generated by chromosome jumping. These libraries allow us to analyze large areas of the genome and overcome distance limitations in common cloning techniques. A jumping library clone is composed of two stretches of DNA that are usually located many kilobases away from each other. The stretch of DNA located between these two “ends” is deleted by a series of biochemical manipulations carried out at the start of this cloning technique. Invention and early improvements=Origin= Chromosome jumping (or chromosome hopping) was first described in 1984 by Collins and Weissman. At the time, cloning techniques allowed for generation of clones of limited size (up to 240kb), and cytogenetic techniques allowed for mapping such clones to a small region of a particular chromosome to a resolution of around 5-10Mb. Therefore, a major gap remained in resolution between available technologies, and no methods were available for mapping larger areas of the genome. =Basic principle and original method= This figure is a schematic representation of the method used for creating jumping libraries when it was originally developed in the 80s. This technique is an extension of “chromosome walking” that allows for larger “steps” along the chromosome. If we desire to take steps of length N kb, we first require very high molecular weight DNA. Once isolated, we partially digest it with a frequent-cutting restriction enzyme (such as MboI or BamHI). Next, obtained fragments are selected for size which should be around N kb in length. DNA must then be ligated at low concentration to favour ligation into circles rather than formation of multimers. A DNA marker (such as the amber suppressor tRNA gene supF) can be included at this time point within the covalently linked circle to allow for selection of junction fragments. Circles are subsequently fully digested with a second restriction enzyme (such as EcoRI) to generate a large number of fragments. Such fragments are ligated into vectors (such as a λ vector) which should be selected for using the DNA marker introduced earlier. The remaining fragments thus represent our library of junction fragments, or “jumping library”. The next step is to screen this library with a probe that represents a “starting point” of the desired “chromosome hop”, i.e. determining the location of the genome that is being interrogated. Clones obtained from this final selection step will consist of DNA that is homologous to our probe, separated by our DNA marker from another DNA sequence that was originally located N kb away (thus being called “jumping”). By generating several libraries of different N values, we should eventually be able to map the entire genome and move from one location to another, while controlling direction, by any value of N desired. =Early challenges and improvements= The original technique of chromosome jumping was developed in the laboratories of Collins and Weissman at Yale University in New Haven, U.S. and the laboratories of Poustka and Lehrach at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany. Collins and Weissman’s method described above encountered some early limitations. The main concern was with avoiding non-circularized fragments. Two solutions were suggested: either screening junction fragments with a given probe or adding a second size-selection step after the ligation to separate single circular clones (monomers) from clones ligated to each other (multimers). The authors also suggested that other markers such as the λ cos site or antibiotic resistance genes should be considered (instead of the amber suppressor tRNA gene) to facilitate selection of junction clones. Poustka and Lehrach suggested that full digestion with rare-cutting restrictions enzymes (such as NotI) should be used for the first step of the library construction instead of partial digestion with a frequently cutting restriction enzyme. This would significantly reduce the number of clones from millions to thousands. However, this could create problems with circularizing the DNA fragments since these fragments would be very long, and would also lose the flexibility in choice of end points that one gets in partial digests. One suggestion for overcoming these problems would be to combine the two methods, i.e. to construct a jumping library from DNA fragments digested partially with a commonly cutting restriction enzyme and completely with a rare cutting restriction enzyme and circularizing them into plasmids cleaved with both enzymes. Several of these “combination” libraries were completed in 1986. In 1991, Zabarovsky et al. proposed a new approach for construction of jumping libraries. This approach included the use of two separate λ vectors for library construction, and a partial filling-in reaction that removes the need for a selectable marker. This filling-in reaction worked by destroying the specific cohesive ends (resulting from restriction digests) of the DNA fragments that were nonligated and noncircularized, thus preventing them from cloning into the vectors, in a more energy-efficient and accurate manner. Furthermore, this improved technique required less DNA to start with, and also produced a library that could be transferred into a plasmid form, making it easier to store and replicate. Using this new approach, they successfully constructed a human NotI jumping library from a lymphoblastoid cell line and a human chromosome 3-specific NotI jumping library from a human chromosome 3 and mouse hybrid cell line. Current method Second-generation or \\"Next-Gen\\" (NGS) techniques have evolved radically: the sequencing capacity has increased more than ten thousandfold and the cost has dropped by over one million fold since 2007(National Human Genome Research Institute). NGS has revolutionized the Genetic field in many ways. =Library construction= A library is often prepared by random fragmentation of DNA and ligation of common adaptor sequences. However, the generated short reads challenge the identification of structural variants, such as indels, translocations, and duplication. Large regions of simple repeats can further complicate the alignment. Alternatively, jumping library can be used with NGS for the mapping of structural variation and scaffolding of de novo assemblies. This figure is schematic representation of one of the most recently used methods for creating jumping libraries. Jumping Libraries can be categorized according to the length of the incorporated DNA fragments. *Short-jump library 3 kb genomic DNA fragments are ligated with biotinylate ends and circularized. The circular segments are then sheared into small fragments and the biotinylated fragments are selected by affinity assay for paired-end sequencing. There are two issues related to Short-jump libraries. First, a read can pass through the biotinylated circularization junction and reduce the effective read length. Second, reads from non-jumped fragments (i.e. fragments without the circularization junction) are sequenced and reduce genomic coverage. It has been reported that non-jumped fragments range from 4% to 13%, depending on the size of selection. The first problem might be solved by shearing circles into a larger size and select for those larger fragments. The second problem can be addressed by using Custom Barcoded Jumping Library. *Custom Barcoded Jumping Library This specific jumping library uses adaptors containing markers for fragment selection in combination with barcodes for multiplexing. The protocol was developed by Talkowski et al. and based on mate-pair library preparation for SOLiD sequencing. The selected DNA fragment size is 3.5 – 4.5 kb. Two adaptors were involved: one containing an EcoP15I recognition site and an AC overhang; the other containing a GT overhang, a biotinylated thymine, and an oligo barcode. The circularized DNA was digested and the fragments with biotynylated adaptors were selected for(See Figure 3). The EcoP15I recognition site and barcode help to distinguish junction fragments from nonjump fragments. These targeted fragments should contain 25 to 27bp of genomic DNA, the EcoP15I recognition site, the overhang, and the barcode. *Long-jump library This library construction process is similar to that of Short-jump library except that the condition is optimized for longer fragments(5 kb). *Fosmid-jump library This library construction process is also similar to that of Short- jump library except that transfection using the E. coli vector is required for amplification of large (40 kb) DNA fragments. In addition, the Fosmids can be modified to facilitate the conversion into jumping library compatible with certain Next Generation Sequencers. =Paired-end sequencing= The segments resulting from circularization during constructing jumping library are cleaved, and DNA fragments with markers will be enriched and subjected to paired-end sequencing. These DNA fragments are sequenced from both ends and generate pairs of reads. The genomic distance between the reads in each pair is approximately known and used for the assembly process. For example, a DNA clone generated by random fragmentation is about 200 bp, and a read from each end is around 180bp, overlapping each other. This should be distinguished from mate-pair sequencing, which is basically a combination of Next Generation Sequencing with jumping libraries. =Computational analysis= Different assembly tools have been developed to handle jumping library data. One example is DELLY. DELLY was developed to discover genomic structural variants and “integrates short insert paired-ends, long-range mate-pairs and split-read alignments” to detect rearrangements at sequence level. An example of joint development of new experimental design and algorithm development is demonstrated by the ALLPATHS-LG assembler. =Confirmation= When used for detection of genetic and genomic changes, jumping clones require validation by Sanger sequencing. Applications=Early applications= In the early days, chromosome walking from genetically linked DNA markers was used to identify and clone disease genes. However, the large molecular distance between known markers and the gene of interest was complicating the cloning process. In 1987, a human chromosome jumping library was constructed to clone the cystic fibrosis gene. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease affecting 1 in 2000 Caucasians. This was the first disease in which the usefulness of the jumping libraries was demonstrated. Met oncogene was a marker tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene on human chromosome 7, and the library was screened for a jumping clone starting at this marker. The cystic fibrosis gene was determined to localize 240kb downstream of the met gene. Chromosome jumping helped reduce the mapping “steps” and bypass the highly repetitive regions in the mammalian genome. Chromosome jumping also allowed the production of probes required for faster diagnosis of this and other diseases. =New applications=Characterizing chromosomal rearrangements Balanced chromosomal rearrangements can have a significant contribution to diseases, as demonstrated by the studies of leukemia. However, many of them are undetected by chromosomal microarray. Karyotyping and FISH can identify balanced translocations and inversions but are labor-intensive and provide low resolution (small genomic changes are missed). A jumping library NGS combined approach can be applied to identify such genomic changes. For example, Slade et al. applied this method to fine map a de novo balanced translocation in a child with Wilms' tumor. For this study, 50 million reads were generated, but only 11.6% of these could be mapped uniquely to the reference genome, which represents approximately a sixfold coverage. Talkowski et al. compared different approaches to detect balanced chromosome alterations, and showed that modified jumping library in combination with next generation DNA sequencing is an accurate method for mapping chromosomal breakpoints. Two varieties of jumping libraries (short-jump libraries and custom barcoded jumping libraries) were tested and compared to standard sequencing libraries. For standard NGS, 200-500bp fragments are generated. About 0.03% -0.54% of fragments represent chimeric pairs, which are pairs of end-reads that are mapped to two different chromosomes. Therefore, very few fragments cover the breakpoint area. When using short-jump libraries with fragments of 3.2–3.8kb, the percentage of chimeric pairs increased to 1.3%. With Custom Barcoded Jumping Libraries, the percentage of chimeric pairs further increased to 1.49%. Prenatal diagnosis Conventional cytogenetic testing cannot offer the gene-level resolution required to predict the outcome of a pregnancy and whole genome deep sequencing is not practical for routine prenatal diagnosis. Whole-genome jumping library could complement conventional prenatal testing. This novel method was successfully applied to idenfity a case of CHARGE syndrome. De novo assembly In metagenomics, regions of the genomes that are shared between strains are typically longer than the reads. This complicates the assembly process and makes reconstructing individual genomes for a species a daunting task. Chimeric pairs that are mapped far apart in the genome can facilitate the de novo assembly process. By using a longer-jump library, Ribeiro et al. demonstrated that the assemblies of bacterial genomes were of high quality while reducing both cost and time. =Limitation= The cost of sequencing has dropped dramatically during the past few years while the cost of construction of jumping libraries has not. Therefore, as new sequencing technologies and bioinformatic tools are developed, jumping libraries may become redundant.

It follows the filmmaker as he follows up on his earlier film, Sharkwater, and examines both looming environmental collapse and what people, especially young people, are doing to avert it. The film's world premiere was at the Toronto International Film Festival in the TIFF Docs section. Synopsis While on assignment to photograph sharks in the Galapagos Islands, Stewart became aware of illegal longlining, indiscriminately killing sharks within the marine reserve. In an effort to promote awareness of the situation, he decided to make a movie to bring people closer to sharks, a four-year effort that resulted in Sharkwater.

Traveling the globe to meet with the individuals and organizations working on a solution, Stewart finds encouragement and hope, variously pointing to the revolutions of the past and highlighting the current work of selected people. If people were informed about what was really going on, he argues, they would fight for their future, and the future of other generations. In time, he concentrates on the efforts of the young, as they have the most to lose: climate change and environmental collapse could take long enough that their elders may not be around to see the worst of what they have done.

He was also an outspoken advocate for change, especially on the need for a stronger and more effective voice for public health, and the need for political action on climate change.  Education  Born in Australia in 1926, John Last obtained his MB BS in 1949 and his MD (by thesis) in 1968, from the University of Adelaide. In the interim he undertook 5 years of hospital-based training, 5 years in general practice, and served as a ship's surgeon. In 1960 he obtained a DPH from the University of Sydney, and was then appointed Visiting Fellow, Medical Research Council Social Medicine Research Unit, London Hospital Medical College, England (1961–62). He earned specialty recognition in Australasia (FRACP 1973; FRACPHM 1990), the United States (FACPM 1980; FACE 1981), the United Kingdom (FFCM 1982), and Canada (FRCPC 1987).  Career  Last made substantive contributions to public health higher education, especially in the public health reference literature, including the dissemination of methods for public health research, and to clarifying related ethical issues. He has held academic posts at the University of Sydney, the University of Vermont, and the University of Edinburgh, and was professor of epidemiology and community medicine at the University of Ottawa since 1969 until the time of his death, then with the status of Emeritus Professor.

Skoarding is not a word used to describe two sports. It is an integration of two alpine disciplines skiing and snowboarding. Skoarding was first developed/discovered in 2011 in the French alpine ski resort of Peisey Nancroix close to Les Arcs. Whilst switching their snowboards for fats skis Simon Wilkinson and Leon Baker discovered that after many years snowboarding that placing two skis on in the usual fashion but still \\"riding\\" in the same style that they have always been accustomed to should in fact be called something completely new. Although laughed at by friends the idea soon caught on and many new characteristics became quickly apparent. firstly the choice of route on \\"the hill\\" whilst traditional skiers choose a predictive smooth pattern snowboarders are renowned for their completely unpredictable riding pattern and this is one of the most prolific Skoarder traits. Other Skoarding traits include \\"hanging\\" with groups of snowboarders, one skier \\"hanging\\" with a group of snowboarders will quite quickly find him/herself becoming a Skoarder without realising it. Becoming a Skoarder can happen is several different ways, this can happen completely by accident by \\"hanging\\" or by default a snowboarder trying skiing and just getting stuck in but following the same style he/she is accustomed to. Currently Skoarding is not largely recognised as a designated alternative to skiing, but there are community groups forming and growing in numbers as people are realising that this is not just a fad. Technique Skoarding April in Peisey Nancroix Skoarding test Les Arcs, France It is very simple to ascertain whether someone is skiing or skoarding. Anybody who has been taught to ski from scratch will be aware that all the motion of the turns is done by the legs and lower body.

In 1889 he began studying painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. His teachers included William Merritt Chase, Thomas Anshutz and Cecilia Beaux. Abram Molarsky and his younger brother Maurice Molarsky, who was also a student at the Pennsylvania Academy, went to Paris to continue their artistic studies in 1906. Abram returned to Philadelphia in 1908, where he married artist Sarah Ann Shreve. In 1913, Molarsky had his first solo show at the Doll & Richards Gallery in Boston, where he and his wife had settled. \\"Molarsky's color is delicate, refined and harmonious,\\" wrote critic William Howe Downes, who had authored books about American painters Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent. After five years in the Boston area, the family moved to Nutley, New Jersey, where Molarsky would spend the rest of his life. Many of the landscapes he painted are scenes of the local parks, woods and fields near Nutley, where he and his wife often worked plein air. During the summers, they often painted in Provincetown, Gloucester and Rockport, Massachusetts. In 1922 a writer for The Boston Evening Transcript visited Molarsky's summer studio in Gloucester and wrote that the paintings had \\"a rich and translucent patina of color.\\" He described one landscape: \\"Delightful to the senses is a little scene from the moors overlooking the harbor, with its fresh notations of color, flight of green, soft distance and rolling clouds.\\" Throughout his career, Molarsky showed at many galleries and museums, including the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Corcoran Gallery, the National Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Montclair Art Museum and the Newark Museum. In New York, he was represented by the Milch Gallery. In addition to doing his own work, Molarsky taught plein air painting, watercolor and pastel to students in Nutley for many years.

Abnormal activity such as arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats) is recorded by \\"freezing\\" a segment of the memory for later review. Typically, up to three episodes of abnormal activity can be stored,Diagnostic assessment of recurrent unexplained syncope with a new subcutaneously implantable loop recorder, Oxford Journals, 2000 with the most recent episode replacing the oldest.The Implantable Loop Recorder: Current Uses, Future Directions, The Journal of Innovations in Cardiac Rhythm Management, 2011 Recording can be activated in two ways. First, recording may be activated automatically according to heart rate ranges previously defined and set in the ILR by the physician. If the heart rate drops below, or rises above, the set rates, the ILR will record without the patient’s knowledge. The second way the ILR records is through a hand-held \\"patient activator\\" whereby the patient triggers a recording by pushing a button when they notice symptoms such as skipped beats, lightheadedness or dizziness. The ILR records by \\"freezing\\" the electrical information preceding, during and after the symptoms in the format of an electrocardiogram. The physician can download and review the recorded events during an office visit using a special programmer, which looks similar to a laptop computer.Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR), Brigham and Women's Hospital Uses The ILR is a useful diagnostic tool when patients experience symptoms such as syncope (fainting), seizures, recurrent palpitations, lightheadedness, or dizziness regularly but not often enough to be captured by a 24-hour or 30-day external monitor. Because of the ILR's long battery life (up to 3 years), the heart can be monitored for an extended period. New devices are able to store a total of 60 minutes of recordings on their memory. Thirty minutes is reserved for automatic storage of arrhythmias according preprogrammed criteria. The remaining 30 minutes can be divided into a selectable number of slots for storage of manually triggered retrograde recordings as an answer to symptoms (fainting, palpitations etc) which may be caused by an arrhythmia. Insertion The ILR is implanted by an electrophysiologist under local anesthesia. A small incision (about 3–4 cm or 1.5 inches) is made just lateral to the sternum below the nipple line, usually on the patient's left side.What is an ILR?, Good Samaritan Hospital (San Jose) A pocket is created under the skin, and the ILR is placed in the pocket. Patients can go home the day of the procedure with few restrictions on activities. Bruising and discomfort in the implant area may persist for several weeks. Patients are instructed in use of the activator, and advised to schedule an appointment with their physician after using it so that information stored in the ILR can be retrieved for diagnosis.

Kiri Blakely of Forbes said \\"Howett’s temper tantrum spotlights the fact that, well, self-published authors are often not professional authors\\" citing the fact that the \\"rather tepid criticism\\" from Big Al \\"was enough to send her over the edge\\" while a writing background held by a writer who had advanced through the traditional channels of publishing \\"includes receiving rigorous criticism and editing\\".

Jean Hannah Edelstein of The Guardian wrote that she did not believe Howett's response was \\"entirely hysterical\\" because other people would likely like to make a similar reaction she made whenever they get negative reviews. Jane Sullivan of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that as more and more online reviews are made, \\"often by readers who don't have any particular expertise in reviewing or don't feel any obligation to be fair to the author\\" more authors are making attacks on the reviews, partly due to the potential loss of sales.Sullivan, Jane. \\"Writing wrongs - the author's lament.\\" (Opinion) Sydney Morning Herald.

Morgan O'Rourke of Risk Management said that Howett \\"likely sabotaged her career as a respectable writer\\" because the outburst would remain on search engines even after the public turns its attention to another scandal, and that he suggested that she adopt a pen name. Drew Grant of Salon said the response made him wonder if she had intentionally responded to the review as a way to increase publicity for her book and make more money. Steve Burgess of the Calgary Herald said \\"More than one author is probably trying to kick-start something similar right now.\\" O'Rourke said \\"While the trials and tribulations of Jacqueline Howett are only a small-scale example of the destructive power of the online horde, the lessons that this incident teaches are applicable to any company with an active internet presence.

Wild animal suffering has historically been discussed in the context of the philosophy of religion as an instance of the problem of evil.For discussion of wild animal suffering and its relation to the problem of evil see:   * More recently, a number of academics have considered the suspected scope of the problem from a secular standpoint as a general moral issue, one that humans might be able to take actions toward preventing. For academic discussion of wild animal suffering and its alleviation from a secular standpoint see:       There is considerable disagreement around this latter point, as many believe that human interventions in nature, for this reason, would be either unfeasible, or unethical. Advocates of such interventions point out that humans intervene in nature all the time—sometimes in very substantial ways—for their own interests and to further environmentalist goals and that there are many ways that humans already successfully intervene to help wild animals such as vaccinating and healing injured and sick animals, rescuing animals in fires and natural disasters, feeding hungry animals, providing thirsty animals with water, and caring for orphaned animals. Advocates also argue that although wide-scale interventions may not be possible with current knowledge, they could become feasible in the future with increased knowledge and advanced technologies. For these reasons, they claim it is important to raise awareness about the issue of wild-animal suffering, spread the view that we should help animals suffering in these situations and encourage research into effective measures which can be taken to improve the welfare of wild animals without causing greater harms.  Extent of suffering in nature = Natural selection = In his autobiography, Charles Darwin acknowledged that the existence of extensive suffering in nature was fully compatible with the workings of natural selection, yet maintained that pleasure was the main driver of fitness-increasing behavior in organisms. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins challenged Darwin's claim in his book River Out of Eden, wherein he argued that wild animal suffering must be extensive due to the interplay of the following evolutionary mechanisms: * Selfish genes – genes are wholly indifferent to the well-being of individual organisms as long as DNA is passed on. * The struggle for existence – competition over limited resources results in the majority of organisms dying before passing on their genes. * Malthusian checks – even bountiful periods within a given ecosystem eventually lead to overpopulation and subsequent population crashes. From this, Dawkins concludes that the natural world must necessarily contain enormous amounts of animal suffering as an inevitable consequence of Darwinian evolution. To illustrate this he wrote: > The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all > decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this > sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are > running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being > devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying > of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time > of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the > population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. = Population dynamics = mice with their mother. The reproduction of mice follows an r-selection strategy, with many offspring, short gestation, less parental care, and a short time until sexual maturity. Building on this, others have argued that the prevalence of r-selected animals in the wild indicates that the average life of a wild animal is likely to be very short and end in a painful death. According to this view, the average life of a wild animal should thus contain more suffering than happiness, since a painful death would outweigh any short-lived moments of happiness in their short lives. Welfare economist Yew-Kwang Ng has argued that evolutionary dynamics can lead to animal welfare which is worse than necessary for a given population equilibrium. = Psychological stress = In \\"Bambi or Bessie: Are Wild Animals Happier?\\", Christie Wilcox argues that wild animals do not appear to be happier than domestic animals, based on findings of wild animals having greater levels of cortisol and elevated stress responses relative to domestic animals; additionally, unlike domestic animals, animals in the wild do not have some of their needs provided for them by human caretakers. A study in 2019, found that fear-inducing interactions with predators caused lasting effects on behavior and PTSD-like changes in the brains of wild animals. Philosophical status= History of concern for wild animals = Ole Martin Moen argues that unlike the Western, Judeo-Christian perspective, Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism \\"all hold that the natural world is filled with suffering, that suffering is bad for all who endure it, and that our ultimate aim should be to bring suffering to an end\\". The idea that suffering is common in nature has been observed by several writers historically. In his notebooks (written between 1487–1505), Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci described the suffering experienced by wild animals due to predation and reproduction, questioning: \\"Why did nature not ordain that one animal should not live by the death of another?\\" In his 1779 posthumous work Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, philosopher David Hume made reference to the antagonism experienced and inflicted by wild animals upon each other, observing: \\"The stronger prey upon the weaker, and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety.\\" One expression commonly used to express suffering in nature—\\"Nature, red in tooth and claw\\"—comes from Alfred Tennyson's poem \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\\", published in 1850. In 1851, the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer also insisted on the extent of suffering in nature, drawing attention to the asymmetry between the pleasure experienced by a carnivorous animal and the suffering of the animal it consumes: \\"Whoever wants summarily to test the assertion that the pleasure in the world outweighs the pain, or at any rate that the two balance each other, should compare the feelings of an animal that is devouring another with those of that other\\". In the 1874 posthumous essay \\"On Nature\\", utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote about suffering in nature and the imperative of struggling against it: > In sober truth, nearly all the things which men are hanged or imprisoned for > doing to one another, are nature's every day performances. [...] The phrases > which ascribe perfection to the course of nature can only be considered as > the exaggerations of poetic or devotional feeling, not intended to stand the > test of a sober examination. No one, either religious or irreligious, > believes that the hurtful agencies of nature, considered as a whole, promote > good purposes, in any other way than by inciting human rational creatures to > rise up and struggle against them. [...] Whatsoever, in nature, gives > indication of beneficent design proves this beneficence to be armed only > with limited power; and the duty of man is to cooperate with the beneficent > powers, not by imitating, but by perpetually striving to amend, the course > of nature - and bringing that part of it over which we can exercise control > more nearly into conformity with a high standard of justice and goodness. In his 1892 book Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress, the English writer and naturalist Henry Stephens Salt focused an entire chapter on the plight of wild animals, \\"The Case of Wild Animals\\". Salt wrote that: > It is of the utmost importance to emphasize the fact that, whatever the > legal fiction may have been, or may still be, the rights of animals are not > morally dependent on the so-called rights of property; it is not to owned > animals merely that we must extend our sympathy and protection. [...] To > take advantage of the sufferings of animals, whether wild or tame, for the > gratification of sport, or gluttony, or fashion, is quite incompatible with > any possible assertion of animals' rights. Salt argued that humans are justified in killing wild animals in self-defense, but that \\"[w]e are not justified in unnecessarily killing—still less in torturing—any harmless beings whatsoever.\\" In 1782, Member of Parliament Soame Jenyns argued that this should apply to insects as well: \\"We are unable to give life, and therefore ought not to take it away from the meanest insect without sufficient reason.\\" In his 1906 book The Universal Kinship, J. Howard Moore argued that the egoism of sentient beings—a product of natural selection—which leads them to exploit their sentient fellows, was the \\"most mournful and immense fact in the phenomena of conscious life\\", and speculated whether a sufficiently sympathetic human could significantly improve this situation if given the chance: \\"[One] cannot help wondering whether an ordinary human being with only common-sense and insight and an average concern for the welfare of the world would not make a great improvement in terrestrial affairs if he only had the opportunity for a while.\\" In 1991, the environmental philosopher Arne Næss critiqued what he termed the \\"cult of nature\\" of contemporary and historical attitudes of indifference towards suffering in nature. He argued that we should confront the reality of the wilderness and that we should be prepared to disturb natural processes—when feasible—to relieve suffering. = Ecology as intrinsically valuable = Holmes Rolston III argues that only unnatural animal suffering is a morally bad thing and that humans do not have a duty to intervene in natural cases. He celebrates carnivores in nature because of the significant ecological role they play. Others have argued that the reason that humans have a duty to protect other humans from predation is because humans are part of the cultural world rather than the natural world and so different rules apply to them in these situations. Others argue that prey animals are fulfilling their natural function, and thus flourishing, when they are preyed upon or otherwise die, since this allows natural selection to work. This can be seen by some as an appeal to nature. = Wild animal suffering as a reductio ad absurdum = That people would also be obliged to intervene in nature has been used as a reductio ad absurdum against the position that animals have rights. This is because if animals such as prey animals did have rights, people would be obliged to intervene in nature to protect them, but this is claimed to be absurd. An objection to this argument is that people do not see intervening in the natural world to save other people from predation as absurd and so this could be seen to involve treating non-human animals differently in this situation without justification, which is due to speciesism. However, this argument already grants the premise in question that animals should have rights, and that preferring human interests is wrong, and therefore it is begging the question. = Relevance to the theological problem of evil = The problem of evil has been extended beyond human troubles to include the suffering of animals over the course of evolution. = Laissez-faire = Clare Palmer labels the view that humans should not harm wild animals, but do not have an obligation to aid in the animals when in need, as laissez-faire. She endorses a variant of this position, which claims that humans may have an obligation to assist wild animals, if humans are responsible for their situation.Wilson, Scott D. (2011). \\"Animal Ethics in Context by Palmer, Claire\\". Ethics 121 (4): 824–8. . = Predation as a moral problem = Predation has been considered a moral problem by some philosophers, who argue that we have an obligation to prevent it, while others argue that intervention is not ethically required.  Interventions to reduce suffering = Arguments for intervention = Some theorists have reflected on whether we should accept the harms that animals suffer in nature or try to do something to mitigate them. The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights-based or welfare-based. From a rights-based perspective, if animals have a moral right to life or bodily integrity, intervention may be required to prevent such rights from being violated by other animals. From a welfare-based perspective, a requirement to intervene may arise insofar as it is possible to prevent some of the suffering experienced by wild animals without causing even more suffering. Advocates of intervention in nature argue that nonintervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches. Some proposed courses of action include removing predators from wild areas, refraining from reintroducing predators, providing medical care to sick or injured animals, rescuing wild animals from natural disasters and using biotechnology to eradicate pain and suffering. = Practicality of intervening in nature = A common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved, or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance. Aaron Simmons argues that we should not intervene to save animals in nature because doing so would result in unintended consequences such as damaging the ecosystem, interfering with human projects, or resulting more animal deaths overall. Philosopher Peter Singer has argued that intervention in nature would be justified if one could be reasonably confident that this would greatly reduce wild animal suffering and death in the long run. In practice, however, Singer cautions against interfering with ecosystems because he fears that doing so would cause more harm than good. Other authors dispute Singer's empirical claim about the likely consequences of intervening in the natural world, and argue that some types of intervention can be expected to produce good consequences overall. Economist Tyler Cowen cites examples of animal species whose extinction is not generally regarded as having been on balance bad for the world. Cowen also notes that insofar as humans are already intervening in nature, the relevant practical question is not whether we should intervene at all, but what particular forms of intervention we should favor. Philosopher Oscar Horta similarly writes that there are already many cases in which we intervene in nature for other reasons, such as for human interest in nature and environmental preservation as something valuable in their own rights. Horta has also proposed that courses of action aiming at helping wild animals should be carried out and adequately monitored first in urban, suburban, industrial, or agricultural areas. Likewise, moral philosopher Jeff McMahan argues that since humans \\"are already causing massive, precipitate changes in the natural world,\\" we should favor those changes that would promote the survival \\"of herbivorous rather than carnivorous species.\\" Peter Vallentyne suggests that, while humans should not eliminate predators in nature, they can intervene to help prey in more limited ways. In the same way that we help humans in need when the cost to us is small, we might help some wild animals at least in limited circumstances. = Potential conflict between animal rights and environmentalism = It has been argued that the environmentalist goal of preserving certain abstract entities such as species and ecosystems and a policy of non-interference in regard to natural processes is incompatible with animal rights views, which place the welfare and interests of individual nonhuman animals at the center of concern. Examples include environmentalists supporting hunting for species population control, while animal rights advocates oppose it; animal rights advocates arguing for the extinction or reengineering of carnivores or r-strategist species, while deep ecologists defend their right to be and flourish as they are; animal rights advocates defending the reduction of wildlife habitats or arguing against their expansion out of concern that most animal suffering takes place within them, while environmentalists want to safeguard and expand them. Oscar Horta has argued that there are instances where environmentalists and animal rights advocates may both support approaches which would consequently reduce wild animal suffering. = Welfare biology = Welfare biology is a proposed research field for studying the welfare of nonhuman animals, with a particular focus on their relationship with natural ecosystems. It was first advanced in 1995 by Yew-Kwang Ng, who defined it as \\"the study of living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering)\\". Such research is intended to promote concern for nonhuman animal suffering in the wild and to establish effective actions that can be undertaken to help these individuals. = History of interventions = In 2016, 350 starving hippos and buffaloes at Kruger National Park were killed by park rangers. One of the motives for the action was to prevent the animals from suffering as they died. In 2018, a team of BBC filmmakers dug a ramp in the snow to allow a group of penguins to escape a ravine. In 2019, 2,000 baby flamingos were rescued after they were abandoned by their parents in a drought in South Africa. Wildlife contraception has been used successfully to reduce and stabilize populations of wild horses, white-tailed deer, American bison and African elephants. Vaccination programs have been successfully implemented to prevent rabies and tuberculosis in wild animals.

A concrete sculpture by Alberto Sánchez Pérez, El pueblo español tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella (\\"The Spanish people have a path which leads to a star\\") was displayed outside while Alexander Calder's Mercury Fountain and Pablo Picasso's Guernica were on display on the ground floor. Painting Miró painted his mural in June 1937, directly onto six square celotex insulation panels forming part of the structure of the pavilion. It was situated at the end of a double-height open space with a stairway, and was visible from two floors. The work depicts a Catalan peasant wearing a barretina hat —symbol of Catalan identity— and holding up a sickle, sometimes misinterpreted by some as an explicitly Communist symbol but intended by Miró simply as the peasant's traditional agricultural implement and improvised weapon. The peasant's other hand makes the Republican clenched fist salute, and his face was contorted into a cry of despair. The peasant had been used as a symbol of Catalan nationalism since the 17th century, and was a theme in Miró's work since the 1920s. Sert said in 1968 that Miró's work was inspired by a Catalan song, \\"Els Segadors\\" (The Reapers), which eventually became Catalonia's national anthem. The exhibition closed in November 1937, and the mural was dismantled along with the rest of the pavilion in early 1938. Miró donated the mural to the Spanish government, and the six panels were packed to be transported to the Ministry of Fine Arts in Valencia. The mural was subsequently lost or destroyed, although other works by Miró on celotex from 1937 survive. Miró did not seem particularly concerned about the loss of his work, perhaps because it was overshadowed in the pavilion by Picasso's Guernica. The mural survives only in a few surviving black and white photographs. It was mainly black (the peasant's chin, cheek, eye, ear, teeth, left arm, body, teeth), white (his face, nose, neck) and shades of red (cap, nose, cheek, neck, right arm). The background was green, blue, and yellow, and included a blue star and some exposed buff of the celotex ground.

Gothenburg William A. Wearing was born in London, a son of businessman Christopher Hammond Wearing (ca.1785 – 29 February 1860) and his wife Elizabeth Augusta, née Soulsby. He was educated at Trinity College, or St John's College,'Wearing, William Alfred (1816–1875)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/wearing-william- alfred-4818/text8035, accessed 2 March 2013. Cambridge, where he took the degree of B.A. He studied law, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1847. He shortly afterwards left for South Australia, following his parents, who had emigrated in 1839. He immediately began practising and it was not long before he was taken into partnership with the Charles Fenn, one of the largest practices in Adelaide. The partnership was dissolved, and Mr. Wearing was appointed Crown Solicitor, but was able to continue in private practice. In the earlier days of the colony he occasionally took part in colonial politics; working for the election of Mr. (later Judge) Gwynne, and also in securing the return of Dr. Wark. In 1866 he served on the secret court of inquiry which forced the resignation of Police Commissioner Peter Warburton. He took an active part in the 1867 sacking of Mr. Justice Benjamin Boothby and was appointed by the Hon. A. Blyth's or Hon. Sir Henry Ayers' Government as the third judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia in his place. Part of his duties involved holding the Palmerston Circuit Court in the Northern Territory, from where he was returning when the Gothenburg was wrecked. He was not one of the 22 persons who survived. Lionel James Pelham, judge's associate and clerk of arraigns and Joseph James Whitby, who accompanied Judge Wearing to the Northern Territory, in the capacity of acting Crown solicitor, were also lost in the Gothenburg.

This includes enforcing runtime constraints through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a security manager that sandboxes untrusted code from the rest of the operating system, and a suite of security APIs that Java developers can utilise. Despite this, criticism has been directed at the programming language, and Oracle, due to an increase in malicious programs that revealed security vulnerabilities in the JVM, which were subsequently not properly addressed by Oracle in a timely manner. Security features=The JVM= The binary form of programs running on the Java platform is not native machine code but an intermediate bytecode. The JVM performs verification on this bytecode before running it to prevent the program from performing unsafe operations such as branching to incorrect locations, which may contain data rather than instructions. It also allows the JVM to enforce runtime constraints such as array bounds checking. This means that Java programs are significantly less likely to suffer from memory safety flaws such as buffer overflow than programs written in languages such as C which do not provide such memory safety guarantees. The platform does not allow programs to perform certain potentially unsafe operations such as pointer arithmetic or unchecked type casts. It also does not allow manual control over memory allocation and deallocation; users are required to rely on the automatic garbage collection provided by the platform. This also contributes to type safety and memory safety. =Security manager= The platform provides a security manager which allows users to run untrusted bytecode in a \\"sandboxed\\" environment designed to protect them from malicious or poorly written software by preventing the untrusted code from accessing certain platform features and APIs. For example, untrusted code might be prevented from reading or writing files on the local filesystem, running arbitrary commands with the current user's privileges, accessing communication networks, accessing the internal private state of objects using reflection, or causing the JVM to exit. The security manager also allows Java programs to be cryptographically signed; users can choose to allow code with a valid digital signature from a trusted entity to run with full privileges in circumstances where it would otherwise be untrusted. Users can also set fine-grained access control policies for programs from different sources. For example, a user may decide that only system classes should be fully trusted, that code from certain trusted entities may be allowed to read certain specific files, and that all other code should be fully sandboxed. =Security APIs= The Java Class Library provides a number of APIs related to security, such as standard cryptographic algorithms, authentication, and secure communication protocols. Potential sources of security vulnerabilities in Java applications There are a number of possible sources of security vulnerabilities in Java applications, some of which are common to non-Java applications and some of which are specific to the Java platform. (Note that these refer to potential sources of vulnerabilities which need to be kept in mind by security-conscious programmers: this is not intended as a list of actual vulnerabilities.) Examples of potential sources of vulnerability common to Java and non-Java applications are: * Vulnerabilities in the protection mechanisms provided by the hardware or operating system which the application relies upon for its security * Vulnerabilities in native libraries, such as the C standard library, which may be used to implement the application and/or runtime * Vulnerabilities caused purely by errors in user programs (for example improper construction of SQL queries leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities) However, much discussion of Java security focusses on potential sources of vulnerability specific to the Java platform. These include: * Vulnerabilities in the sandboxing mechanism which allow untrusted bytecode to circumvent the restrictions imposed by the security manager * Vulnerabilities in the Java class library which an application relies upon for its security A vulnerability in the Java platform will not necessarily make all Java applications vulnerable. When vulnerabilities and patches are announced, for example by Oracle, the announcement will normally contain a breakdown of which types of application are affected (example). For example, a hypothetical security flaw which affects only the security manager sandboxing mechanism of a particular JVM implementation would mean that only Java applications which run arbitrary untrusted bytecode would be compromised: applications where the user fully trusts and controls all bytecode being executed would not. This would mean that, say, a web browser plugin based on that JVM would be vulnerable to malicious applets downloaded from public websites, but a server- side web application running on the same version of the JVM where the administrator has full control over the classpath would be unaffected.Security Alert for CVE-2013-0422 Released. Oracle Corporation. Retrieved 2013-04-24. As with non-Java applications, security vulnerabilities can stem from parts of the platform which may not initially appear to be security-related. For example, in 2011, Oracle issued a security fix for a bug in the method.Oracle Releases Hotfix for the Double.parseDouble Bug in Record Time. InfoQ. Retrieved 2013-04-24. This method converts a string such as \\"12.34\\" into the equivalent double-precision floating point number. The bug caused this method to enter an infinite loop when called on a specific input. This bug had security implications, because for example if a web server converts a string typed into a form by the user using this method, a malicious user could type in the string which triggers the bug. This would cause the web server thread processing the malicious request to enter an infinite loop and become unavailable for serving requests from other users. Doing this repeatedly to a vulnerable web server would be an easy denial-of-service attack: all the web server's threads for responding to user requests would soon be stuck in the infinite loop and the web server would be unable to serve any legitimate users at all. Criticism of security manager The security manager in the Java platform (which, as mentioned above, is designed to allow the user to safely run untrusted bytecode) has been criticized in recent years for making users vulnerable to malware, especially in web browser plugins which execute Java applets downloaded from public websites, more informally known as \\"Java in the browser\\". Oracle's efforts to address these vulnerabilities resulted in a delay to the release of Java 8.Secure The Train. Blog of Mark Reinhold, Chief Architect of Oracle's Java Platform Group. 2013-04-18. =2012= An OS X trojan referred to as Flashback exploited a vulnerability in Java, which had not been patched by Apple, although Oracle had already released a patch. In April, Apple later released a removal tool for Lion users without Java. With Java 7 Update 4, Oracle began to release Java directly for Lion and later. In October, Apple released an update that removed the Java plugin from all browsers. This was seen as a move by Apple to distance OS X from Java. =2013= In January, a zero-day vulnerability was found in all versions of Java 7, including the latest version Java 7 Update 10, which was already exploited in the wild. The vulnerability was caused by a patch to fix an earlier vulnerability. In response, Apple blacklisted the latest version of the Java plugin. Oracle released a patch (Update 11) within three days. Microsoft also released a patch for Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8. Cyberespionage malware Red October was found exploiting a Java vulnerability that was patched in October 2011. The website for Reporters Without Borders was also compromised by a Java vulnerability in versions prior to Update 11. After the release of Update 11, another vulnerability began circulating online, which was later confirmed. It was also found that Java's security mode itself was vulnerable due to a bug. In response, Mozilla disabled Java (as well as Adobe Reader and Microsoft Silverlight) in Firefox by default, while Apple blacklisted the latest Java plugin again. In February, Twitter reported that it had shut down an attack. Twitter advised users to disable Java, although it did not explain why. Later in the month, Facebook reported that it had been hacked by a zero-day Java attack. Apple also reported an attack. It was found that a breach of an iPhone developer forum was used to attack Twitter, Facebook, and Apple. The forum itself was unaware of the breach. Following Twitter, Facebook, and Apple, Microsoft reported that it was also similarly compromised. Another vulnerability discovered allowed for the Java security sandbox to be completely bypassed in the original release of Java 7, as well as Updates 11 and 15. In March, trojan called McRat was found exploiting a zero-day Java vulnerability. Oracle then released another patch to address the vulnerability.

The HTML5 Chinese Interest Group had over 1000 members. History The creation of an HTML Working Group was first proposed at the 30th Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting in Toronto, on 26 July 1994. The Group was founded with the adoption of its charter in September 1994 and was chaired by Eric Sink. The IETF HTML Working Group oversaw the creation and publication of RFC 1866 in November 1995, the document which defines HTML 2.0. The Group also published RCF 1942 in May 1996, a document which provides an experimental description of an extended set of HTML tables. The IETF Group was dissolved in September 1996. =Change in working direction= In 1999, W3C released HTML 4.01 and then stopped continuing the evolution of HTML, as the W3C's HTMLWG announced it would change their direction to exploitation of XML-based version of HTML (named XHTML 2.0), which has a stricter standard. The traditional version of HTML allowed uncertainties in code review, which means even there are some mistakes in the web pages, browser will still display the contents through error detection and correction. \\"Nowadays, there would be at least one mistake existing in over 99% HTML web pages. \\" estimated by the Google senior programmer Mark Pilgrim. The W3C HTMLWG hoped to boost a more regulated development of the future of the Internet through rigorous standards. While the popularization and application of XHTML had not received many responses from the public. =Collaboration= In 2004, Mozilla and Opera put forward a plan based on HTML 4, as they wanted to continue the evolution of HTML. The plan was not passed. Then they decided to form WHATWG, in order to pursue the future of HTML along with W3C’S HTMLWG but in different direction. In 2006, WHATWG made a breakthrough while XHTML 2.0 was still impractical. As a result, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of W3C announced that the W3C’S HTMLWG would stop to jointly develop HTML5 with WHATWG. Ian Hickson was responsible for both editing the two groups' specifications. In October 2009, W3C dismissed the XHTML 2 group. =Split= In July 2012, W3C's HTMLWG and WHATWG officially parted ways about working on HTML5. WHATWG evolved HTML5 and W3C worked on a more static \\"snapshot\\". Therefore, there are two versions of HTML5 - one is a \\"living standard\\" and the other one is \\"snapshots\\". The split between two bodies was due to conflicts. Regarding fears of this split from the public, then head of WHATWG, Ian Hickson said the split would not be as harmful as people thought. \\"It’s certainly possible that the specs will fork, but it’s unlikely, or at least, unlikely to happen in a way that is harmful.\\" In his opinion, possible conflicts will lead to a more precise standard. And \\"Browser vendors will just know to use the more precise one.\\" Differences between WHATWG and HTMLWG WHATWG maintains a living standard and stopped using version numbers. W3C's HTMLWG leaves the WHATWG spec in order to stick producing snapshots. See also About the HTMLWG, a brief summary of HTMLWG.

Genre, in terms of genre studies refers to the method based on similarities in the narrative elements from which media-texts are constructed. Types of Internet genres There are various genres of Internet services. =Personal homepage= Personal homepages are regularly updated, allows people to connect with those that they know through leaving messages and joining buddylists. =Message boards= A message board is one of the most familiar genres of online gathering place, which is asynchronous, meaning people do not have to be in the same place at the same time to have a conversation.Kim, A.J. (2000). Community Building on the Web: Secret Strategies for Successful Online Communities, London: Peachpit Press. With this genre posts can be accessed at any time and it is easy to ignore undesirable content. =E-mail lists and newsletters= An electronic mailing list or email list is a special usage of email that allows for widespread distribution of information to many Internet users. It is the easiestkind of online gathering place to create, maintain and participate. =Chat groups= Chat Group, where people can chat synchronously, communicating in the same place at the same time.Figallo, C. (1998). Hosting Web Communities: Building Relationships, Increasing Customer Loyalty and Maintaining a Competitive Edge, Chichester: John Wiley & Sons. Many micro-blogging platforms now function like chat groups, such as Twitter. The first online chat system was called Talkomatic, created by Doug Brown and David R. Woolley in 1973 on the PLATO System at the University of Illinois. It offered several channels, each of which could accommodate up to five people, with messages appearing on all users' screens character-by-character as they were typed. Talkomatic was very popular among PLATO users into the mid-1980s. =Virtual worlds= A virtual world takes the form of a computer-based simulated environment through which users can interact with one another and use and create objects. The term has become largely synonymous with interactive 3D virtual environments, where the users take the form of avatars visible to others.Cook, A.D. (2009).

Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers The Lightspeed Rangers The Lightspeed Rangers are fictional characters and heroes in the Power Rangers universe, and are the primary protagonists in the 2000 television series Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue. The Lightspeed Rescue Rangers were recruited by the U.S. Government under Operation Lightspeed, in order to fight ancient Demons that were attacking the fictional town of Mariner Bay, California. They were the first team of Power Rangers to be granted powers entirely through Earth human technology, and not through mystic forces, wild beasts, or by alien technology. They were also the first Power Ranger team whose identities were known to the public because they are public servants and thus have no need to hide their identity. =Carter Grayson= Carter Grayson is the main protagonist of the series, a firefighter and the Red Lightspeed Ranger. He is the serious and devoted leader of the Lightspeed team. He risked his life with his daredevil maneuvers, but always saved those in danger. When he was a child, Carter was rescued from a burning building by William Mitchell. It was because of the firefighter that Carter decided he wanted to be a firefighter as well. Following a firefighter duty where he got a brief glimpse of Ghouligan, Carter was approached by Dana and two of Captain Mitchell's men and brought to the Lightspeed Aquabase by them. He was the first to accept his role as a Lightspeed Power Ranger. He was also chosen to utilize the powers of the Titanium Morpher, but was unable to, as it proved too powerful for a normal human, despite his large muscles. He bravely took down Queen Bansheera in the final battle with the Demons, hurling her into the Shadow World for good. Carter returned to Firefighting after his time at Lightspeed Rescue. During the series, he develops serious romantic feelings for Dana, the Pink Ranger, and it appeared to be mutual. It is unknown if they became a couple afterwards, even though they were the only Lightspeed Rangers seen together prior to the final battle of Power Rangers: Super Megaforce. When Vypra returned from the dead and began terrorizing Silver Hills, Carter reunited the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers, who helped the Time Force Rangers defeat her. When the Machine Empire's forces unearthed Zedd's Serpentera to destroy Earth, Carter teamed up with nine other Red Rangers and travelled to the moon to stop them in the Wild Force episode \\"Forever Red \\"he also gets Cole. and Carter saves a girl who had become a hostage for the Red Rangers. He and Dana later appeared to help victims of the Warstar Armada's attack in Super Megaforce, and again with their teammates in the final battle. Carter survives capture during the events of \\"Shattered Grid\\" while his other teammates are captured by Drakon. He reveals his identity as a fire fighter to his fellow Rangers when Jen and Kimberly arrive with Karone in tow and offers aid. He later joins his fellow Rangers in a fight against Drakon's forces, however his powers are blasted away by Drakon's cannons before he and his allies are taken away from Corinth. Carter is played by Sean CW Johnson. =Chad Lee= Chad Lee is the Blue Lightspeed Ranger and the team's second- in-command, known for his aquatic skills. He often spends time scuba diving, feeling connected to the marine life. He was working at a marine park when Captain Mitchell's men picked him up. Chad brings to the team his exceptional martial arts ability, and water rescue skills. Chad studied under a karate master named Tomashiro, who felt that Chad's true destiny was as a martial arts master and not a Ranger. Tomashiro then helped train a monster named Cyclopter, hoping to replace Chad as his best student (Cyclopter even defeated Chad in battle), until Cyclopter turned on him. Chad remembers everything Tomashiro taught him then and defeats Cyclopter, and Tomashiro even comes to ask Chad for a tour of the Aqua Base. Chad also temporarily had a relationship with the mermaid Marina, but they parted ways eventually. Chad becomes close with Yellow Ranger Kelsey during the series. After leaving Lightspeed, Chad became a lifeguard, but returned to help his team fight an undead Vypra with the Time Force Rangers, and again in Super Megaforce alongside other veteran Rangers in battling the last forces of the Armada. Chad is played by Michael Chaturantabut. =Joel Rawlings= Joel Rawlings is an aerial stuntman under the name \\"The Sky Cowboy\\" and is recruited by Captain Mitchell to be the Green Lightspeed Ranger. Following one of his aerial acts at an air show, Joel was approached by Captain Mitchell's men and brought to the Lightspeed Aquabase. He is extremely reluctant to become a Power Ranger at first, not believing in Lightspeed or what it has to offer. But when he sees his beloved Mariner Bay in danger, he decides to take them up on their offer. He shows interest in the Rangers' assistant, Ms. Angela Fairweather. In the epilogue of the finale episode, Rawlings and Ms. Fairweather are about to go out on their first date when he is called away on Ranger business, unable to let his duties end with the Demons. He eventually marries her, and the two are seen heading off on their honeymoon right before he returns to the team to help battle Vypra with the Time Force Power Rangers. He would later join his teammates in the final battle with the Armada forces in Super Megaforce. Joel is played by Keith Robinson. =Kelsey Winslow= Kelsey is extremely active physically, being a professional mountain climber and overall extreme sports enthusiast. She takes the job as the Lightspeed Rescue Yellow Ranger, seeing it as the most exciting thing of which she's ever heard. Kelsey recently reconciled with her grandmother, whose preoccupation with wealth and indifference towards Kelsey drove the two apart. Kelsey is very much a free spirit, who loves extreme sports. She's very agile, and good at making quick decisions. However, she's also rather impulsive, hotheaded and often will attack without thinking out the consequences. This is shown when, after failing to correctly do a mission, she was nearly killed and had to be hospitalized. Out of all the Rangers, Kelsey has the closest relationship with Chad, the Blue Lightspeed Ranger. They are often seen doing activities together, like martial arts. Kelsey returned to extreme sports following the collapse of Lightspeed (starting with an extreme sports comp) after defeating Queen Bansheera and her forces to save Mariner Bay. The Lightspeed Rangers were featured in a chronicle of Power Ranger history compiled by Tommy Oliver shortly after he formed the Dino Rangers, which was found by the nascent Ranger team in the Dino Lab. Kelsey and the other Lightspeed Rangers returned as part of the army of Legendary Rangers that helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all, fighting in a huge battle against hundreds of X Borgs and dozens of Bruisers. Kelsey is played by Sasha Williams. =Dana Mitchell= Dana Leigh Mitchell is the daughter of Captain Mitchell, younger sister of Ryan Mitchell, and the Pink Lightspeed Ranger. Dana is a tormented, reserved, stoic and compassionate young heroine who is also intellectual and level-headed. With help from two unnamed operatives, Dana gathers the team from all over Mariner Bay. Dana is a very invaluable asset to the team as one of the Rangers. She is very blunt with her words and easily gets impatient. Dana had a very brief stint as a model, but quit when she realized that being a Ranger was more important. She is later reconciled with her long-lost older brother, Ryan. During the series, she develops serious romantic feelings for Carter, the Red Ranger, and it appeared to be mutual. It is unknown if they became a couple afterwards. She often describes herself as an ugly duckling because she grew up without a mother, and later transforms into a beautiful swan. Towards the end of the series, Dana loses her fear and is stripped of her heavy burdens of her past. After Lightspeed Rescue, Dana fulfilled her dream of becoming a doctor and practices as a pediatrician. She was called into duty once more when Vypra returned and teamed with the Time Force Rangers. She and Carter appeared unmorphed to help civilians in Super Megaforce, and then again in uniform as part of the veteran Ranger army. Dana is played by Alison MacInnis. =Ryan Mitchell= Ryan Mitchell is Captain Mitchell's son, Dana Mitchell's older brother, and the Titanium Ranger. When Ryan was very young, he was involved in an accident along with his father, Captain Mitchell, and his sister Dana, and all three were suspended over a cliff. Captain Mitchell had a secure grasp of Dana, but Ryan was hanging on by Mitchell's shoe. The spirit of Diabolico appeared and offered a deal to Captain Mitchell....Diabolico would save the child, but in payment he would raise the child himself and Captain Mitchell would not see him again until his 20th birthday. Captain Mitchell at first refused, but relented when Ryan began to fall. Mitchell later said that it was the hardest decision he had ever made. Ryan was thus raised by Diabolico and taught him that his father had rejected him, favoring Dana. Diabolico instructed Ryan to steal the prototype Titanium Morpher from the Lightspeed Base and destroy the other Power Rangers (including his sister Dana) with the Titanium Ranger power. He nearly succeeded, but Ms. Fairweather brought out the V-Lancers, which overpowered Ryan. Just as the Power Rangers were about to destroy Ryan, however, Captain Mitchell (recognizing Ryan's visible eyes) called them back and told them the back story. After some soul-searching, Ryan turns on Diabolico and joins the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers. Because of Ryan's treachery, Diabolico did a dream attack where he placed a curse on him in the form of a cobra tattoo which would get closer to his neck every time he morphed until it destroyed him. Ryan eventually found and destroyed the Cobra Monster that was the source of the curse, breaking the curse. After a while, Ryan left to find more information about the demons and find a way to defeat them. This was because of the lack of a storyline in the Sentai footage. He would eventually return to join the Rangers in the final battle and return his morpher to Lightspeed Rescue. In Power Rangers Time Force, Ryan shows up again to help the Lightspeed and Time Force Rangers to battle Vypra when she summons the super demon Quarganon, appearing alongside Quantum Ranger Eric Myers. He would also join the veteran Ranger army in Super Megaforce. He is the first non-Super Sentai Ranger, followed by the A-Squad Rangers in SPD and the Spirit Rangers in Jungle Fury. He is also the only non-Super Sentai Sixth Ranger as there was no Sixth Ranger in GoGoV. The Titanium Ranger's design is also noticeably different from the original GoGoV uniforms. The uniform is based on the suit designs of Turboranger, with minor tweaks such as a Lightspeed belt, gloves, boots and gold shoulder pads. The helmet is modeled after the Lightspeed helmet (single color and no mouthpiece) and its visor is modeled after the V from the original Sentai title. This helmet was later recreated for Super Megaforce, but with the error of a piece previously hidden by the visor being visible outside it. He was also the only Ranger-exclusive hero featured in the battle. Ryan is played by Rhett Fisher. Allies of the Power Rangers=Captain William Mitchell= Captain William Mitchell is the captain of the Lightspeed Aquabase, mentor to the Lightspeed Rangers, and father of Dana and Ryan Mitchell. In his earlier life, he once worked as a firefighter that saved a young Carter, but he received a huge scar on his right shoulder. Later on, he was involved in a car accident that left him, Dana, and Ryan hanging from a cliff. Captain Mitchell had a secure grasp of a bleeding Dana, but a frightened Ryan was hanging on by Mitchell's leg. The spirit of Diabolico appeared and offered a deal to Captain Mitchell...Diabolico would save the child. But in payment, he would raise the child himself and Captain Mitchell would not see him again until his 20th birthday. Captain Mitchell at first refused, but relented when Ryan began to fall. Mitchell later said that it was the hardest decision he had ever made. Captain Mitchell is often tormented by nightmares of Dana and Ryan getting killed, which leads to over protectiveness of both of them, but later learns that his children had just been knocked out. Upon the release of the Demons, Captain Mitchell was responsible for gathering the ones that became the Lightspeed Rangers (chosen for their special abilities) by sending Dana and two unnamed operatives to pick them up. When Ryan had recently reappeared, Mitchell successfully convinced him to leave Diabolico's side and join him as the Titanium Ranger. Captain Mitchell cares for Ryan and Dana with fierce devotion, rescuing them in very dangerous moments, such as when Dana was captured and he went after her himself. Another time was when Ryan was trapped in the Cobra's lair and Captain Mitchell freed him. Captain Mitchell is played by Ron Roggé. =Angela Fairweather= Ms. Angela Fairweather is the Lightspeed Aquabase's residential scientist and Ranger Expert. Before Kat Manx, Ms. Fairweather developed Zords, weaponry, and vehicles for the Rangers. She is the sister of Clark Fairweather who is also a Ranger expert. Ms. Fairweather is often seen and recognized for wearing black sheer pantyhose. Throughout the series, Joel Rawlings often flirts with Ms. Fairweather, though she initially wasn't interested in him (once even lying to him saying there was a protocol and at Lightspeed saying that Lightspeed members couldn't interact with each other). In the final episode, she finally consents to go on a date with him. Half a season later, in the \\"Time for Lightspeed\\" team-up, the two are seen heading off to their honeymoon. When Joel is contacted by Carter, Ms. Fairweather convinces him to help Carter. Ms. Fairweather is played by Monica Louwerens. =Marina= Marina is a lovely mermaid who was romantically interested in Chad Lee and is the daughter of Neptune. She was used by Vypra in a botched plan against Chad. Taking on human legs, Marina later asked for Chad's help in recovering her father's trident from Aquafiend. Marina is played by Kamera Walton. Antagonists Five thousand years ago, a faction of evil demons had plans to destroy and conquer the Earth. They were sealed away in the Tomb of Forever by a powerful warlock. In the present day, a group of wandering nomads accidentally freed the demons. The demons are angry to find that humans have built the city of Mariner Bay over their former palace and vow to get it back. They also worked to revive Queen Bansheera. The leader of the demons at any one time (below Bansheera herself) wielded the Star Power. This Star Power was passed from its initial owner Diabolico to Bansheera's son Olympius during the course of the series as Bansheera awaits the day to release the demons from the Shadow World. =Queen Bansheera= Queen Bansheera (whose name is based on the Banshee of Irish Mythology) is the evil monarch of the demons. She was in parts unknown when Diabolico and his band were freed, but eventually joins her subjects in the Skull Cavern by adopting a form made of pure energy. Her son Prince Olympius enacts a ceremony to restore her physical form with the help of Spellbinder. Due to the Rangers' interference, the ceremony is only able to bring Bansheera back in a rudimentary, cocoon-like form. Later on, she absorbs Vypra's life energy to complete her resurrection and regain her true body. Once restored, Bansheera sets out for world domination, proving far more ruthless than Diabolico or Olympius. She forces Diabolico to destroy Loki, leaves her own son in the Shadow World, and nearly destroys the Rangers. A vengeful Diabolico reveals her weak spot - her heart - to Carter, but she continues to menace the Rangers. She eventually turned Diabolico and Olympius into Super Demons, but they are defeated (after destroying several Megazords). For her final plan, Bansheera intends to open a portal to the Shadow World (disguised as a sarcophagus) to free all the demons from the Shadow World. Taking over the Aquabase and the Omega Megazord, she was close to succeeding. However, Carter kicks her into the portal, forcing Bansheera to grab him in an attempt to drag him with her. During the final struggle, Diabolico's spirit intervenes as Queen Bansheera tells Diabolico that he was just in time to help. Diabolico reveals that he is actually here to help the Rangers defeat her as severing his former queen's tentacles with an energy blast. Howling in defeat, Bansheera falls into the Shadow World where she is mauled by the hordes of demons within. Queen Bansheera is voiced by Diane Salinger. =Prince Olympius= Prince Olympius was the dragon-like son of Queen Bansheera and the prince of the demons. His father is never mentioned. At the beginning of the series, he is still an infant demon, named Impus, who was cared for by the Demons in his mother's absence. As Bansheera repeatedly threatened to give Impus Diabolico's Star Power, the baby demon served as the primary threat and motivation for Diabolico's quest to destroy Mariner Bay and the Lightspeed Rangers. Eventually, Impus gained the Star Power when Diabolico was destroyed for the first time, causing him to encase himself in a red and black cocoon. Soon after, he completed his evolution and emerged from the cocoon as Olympius. He took Diabolico's place as the Rangers' main antagonist, but his youth and inexperience left him less adept than his predecessor. Shortly after his metamorphosis, he gained access to the Aquabase by capturing four of the Rangers, enabling him to assume their forms. Carter Grayson (the Red Lightspeed Ranger) was able to see right through him and foiled his plans, resulting in Olympius falling into the sea. Exposure to water caused Olympius to lose most of his personal power, including his ability to shape-shift. No longer a physical match for the Rangers or his fellow demons, Olympius found himself forced into a subservient position as Vypra and Loki took command of the demon forces. Despite his decreased power, Olympius still managed to cause trouble for the Rangers. In one battle, he actually destroyed the Rangers by using a device that allowed him to use the Rescue Bird against them. Unfortunately for him, Carter's experimental Mobile Armor Vehicle malfunctioned, sending the Red Ranger back in time. Realizing what had happened, Carter was able to change history and prevent Olympius from pulling the trigger on the other Lightspeed Rangers. Olympius has a strong hatred for Carter and repeatedly attempts to capture him, but his attempts are always unsuccessfully carried out. Eventually, Olympius managed to revive Queen Bansheera, but instead of treating him like a prince, she treated him as just another expendable pawn like the rest of her minions. His plans to win her affection were unsuccessful, causing him to quickly lose her favor. When he discovered that Vypra and Loki were to take his place as second-in-command, he plotted to eliminate them by using the monster, Vilevine, to bury the two of them alive. Vypra and Loki survived and resurrected Diabolico during Olympius' next attempt to destroy the Rangers by having the Shadow World's Gatekeeper trap the Rangers in the Shadow World, roaming with defeated demons. However, he himself became trapped at Diabolico's bidding when the gateway was destroyed and the key was stolen - to add insult to injury, the Rangers eventually escaped. To escape the Shadow World, Olympius began defeating the other occupants of the realm, absorbing their energy and evolving into a more powerful, monstrous form. Meanwhile, Jinxer - still loyal to the demon prince - hypnotized Captain Mitchell, commanding him to place a Star Power link inside the Aquabase generator to provide Olympius with more energy. After breaking free of the Shadow World, Olympius seem unstoppable until Ms. Fairweather broke the link to the Aquabase's energy, weakening Olympius enough for the Rangers to defeat him and destroy his Star Power. He was left under the care of Jinxer for a short time, regaining his strength. Upon recovering his power and after Vypra and Loki's deaths at Bansheera's hand, Olympius took revenge on Diabolico by besting him in battle and having his mother turn Diabolico into a mindless slave. With his new minion in tow, Olympius attacked the Rangers, but his plans were derailed when Diabolico regained his mind and rebelled against Olympius. Although the demon prince was able to destroy Diabolico once again, the Rangers used the opportunity to destroy him in return. Queen Bansheera revived both Diabolico and Olympius in new \\"Super Demon\\" forms, allowing them to demolish almost all of the Megazords. Victory seemed at hand until the Rangers brought in their latest and most powerful Megazord: the Life Force Megazord, which killed the two demons once and for all. Impus was responsible for the creation of a variety of different monsters, most of them either fire-elemental (like Fireor and Trifire) or reptilian (Freezard and Infinitor). Other creatures affiliated with him included Mantevil, Vilevine, and an unhatched Monster Egg (which was predicted to grow into a giant hydra monster). After maturing into Olympius, he proved to be a noteworthy adversary to the Rangers. However, using the Star Power put a great strain on him; he had to gradually get used to his new powers. In his first encounter with the Rangers he swiftly defeated them and managed to capture four of them within the Star Power. Soon after, he used the Star Power to turn himself into nearly identical duplicates of his prisoners and used this power to infiltrate the Aquabase. However, after being weakened from exposure to water, he could no longer contain the Rangers inside the Star Power. In battle, Olympius displayed excellent physical strength, stamina, and skills with various weaponry. He primarily used a double-bladed spear, but occasionally used some of the Rangers' own weapons against them, including Carter's Rescue Blaster and the Rescue Bird. Olympius also has shown the ability of pyrokinesis by expelling fire and controlling it. He is a skilled warrior, defeating an army of undead demons during his time in the Shadow World and even besting Diabolico twice (destroying him outright the second time). In his more powerful draconic form, he displayed great powers by reflecting the Rangers' weaponry and firing his own energy. However, to maintain his strength in this form he needed an external energy source (for this he drained power from the Aquabase); without a suitable energy source he was considerably hindered. Even so, he managed to survive blows from the Omega Megazord and Lightspeed Solarzord that would have normally destroyed other monsters, weakening enough only to revert him back to his normal form and destroy his Star Power. In his Super Demon form, he was at the peak of his power; by combining his powers with Diabolico, he managed to destroy nearly all of the Rangers' Megazords, a feat that very few villains and monsters have achieved in the series. Olympius alters his appearance and anatomy over the series, though all his forms have a red color scheme and draconic aspects. His infant form was a mix of a Furby with a baby dragon. His second (adult) form is a humanoid dragon-like warrior with a white face. After escaping from the Shadow World, Olympius developed more demonic features, including large horns, talons, and tail, a snake-like neck, bestial musculature, and a Malebolgia- like jaw. His Super Demon form exaggerates his monstrous features in a Godzilla-like fashion, with a longer, more reptilian snout and the removal of white colors on his face. Impus is voiced by Brianne Siddall while his adult form of Olympius is voiced by Michael Forest. =Diabolico= Diabolico (a name based on the word \\"diabolical,\\" whose root comes from the Spanish for \\"devil\\") is the primary villain for the first part of the Lightspeed Rescue series. He is a golden devil-like demon with an elongated skull, multiple horns and spikes on his head and shoulders, and a second monstrous face on his chest. With Queen Bansheera absent and Prince Impus still an infant, Diabolico is the de facto leader of the demons. In addition to commanding the villains, Diabolico was given the Star Power by Queen Bansheera prior to his imprisonment, indicating that she considered him to be her greatest servant. Some time before the series, Diabolico appeared before Captain Mitchell and his two children when they were hanging off the edge of a cliff after a car accident. He offered to save Mitchell's son, Ryan, if he could take custody of the boy; unable to let his son fall to his doom, Mitchell reluctantly agreed. After telling Mitchell that Ryan would return on his twentieth birthday, Diabolico saved the boy from his fall and spirited him away for training as a mighty warrior. Diabolico led the demons' efforts to destroy Mariner Bay and rebuild Queen Bansheera's empire, but the Lightspeed Rangers thwarted him at every turn. After several failures, he sent Ryan - now a bitter young man - to steal the Titanium Morpher from the Aquabase and use its power against the Rangers. Unfortunately for Diabolico, Captain Mitchell was able to redeem his son, who returned the Titanium Morpher and informed Diabolico that he was severing his ties with him. Queen Bansheera quickly became tired of Diabolico's failures, threatening to take his Star Power and give it to her son Impus if her general could not produce results soon. In response, Diabolico summoned his most powerful monsters - Demonite, Falkar, and Thunderon - with orders to spread explosive feathers across Mariner Bay and destroy the Rangers when they tried to interfere. The powerful demons almost succeeded in their task, but Ryan - having accepted his role as a hero - became the Titanium Ranger once again and fended off the monsters. As punishment for Ryan's interference, Diabolico cursed his one-time protege; every time he morphed, a cobra tattoo would move up his back until it reached his neck and killed him. Despite this advantage, Diabolico's monsters continued to fail against the Lightspeed Rangers. Growing increasingly desperate, Diabolico considered killing Impus himself to prevent himself from losing his Star Power, but lost the chance when the other demons walked in on him. In a final attempt to destroy the Power Rangers, he personally enlarged himself and engaged them in battle. He had the upper hand until Ryan - now purged of the cobra curse - joined the team, allowing them to form the Lightspeed Solarzord. This new Megazord absorbed one of Diabolico's blasts and used it to power its cannons, bombarding Diabolico until he finally fell in defeat. With his destruction, the Star Power went to Impus, who quickly matured into Olympius. As with all defeated monsters, Diabolico's spirit was sent to the Shadow World. However, he was eventually revived by Vypra and Loki to take revenge on Olympius, who used Vilevine to try and destroy them. Diabolico immediately returned to his queen's side, attempting to regain favor with her and recapture the Star Power from Olympius. He managed to trap the demon prince in the Shadow World, but Olympius escaped, vowing vengeance on Diabolico in turn. Diabolico also thwarted the Sorcerer of the Sands' attempt to destroy Skull Cavern, annihilating the ancient wizard in the process. When Queen Bansheera regained her body after absorbing Vypra and sent Loki to eliminate the Rangers, Diabolico overheard her declaring that she was only using Loki to try and destroy all of her foes at once. He immediately came to Loki's aid, only to be sucked into a vortex and dropped outside Skull Cavern with his fellow demon and four of the Lightspeed Rangers. During the resulting battle, Bansheera forced Diabolico to fire on the Rangers before Loki could get out of the way; the Rangers survived, but Loki did not. Infuriated at his queen's callousness, Diabolico contacted Carter (currently trying to free his friends from Skull Cavern) and revealed Bansheera's weak spot. Although Carter took Diabolico's advice and was able to free the victims of the vortex, Bansheera survived, forcing Diabolico to flee. While walking through a forest and fuming over the deaths of Vypra and Loki, Diabolico encountered Olympius, who had been hiding out while recovering from his last battle with the Rangers. The two demons battled fiercely, but Diabolico was defeated in the end. He was dragged back to Queen Bansheera, who turned him into Olympius' mindless \\"pet\\". The two then attacked the Rangers, but some verbal pushing from Carter reawakened Diabolico's mind. As he battled Olympius, he tried to give Carter the key to the Ancient Tomb, but Olympius killed him moments before he could do so. After the Rangers killed Olympius in turn, Bansheera revived the two of them as giant Super Demons. More powerful than ever and firmly under Bansheera's control, Diabolico wreaked havoc on the city and the Rangers' Megazords alongside Olympius. It took the power of the new Lifeforce Megazord to finally destroy the two Super Demons, after which Diabolico's key flew to the Ancient Tomb and revealed the final plan of Queen Bansheera. Although Diabolico was destroyed, he made one final appearance at the very end of The Fate of Lightspeed. While Queen Bansheera attempted to drag Carter into a portal to the Shadow World, Diabolico's spirit appeared before them and offered his help. To Bansheera's dismay, Diabolico intervened on the Rangers' behalf, severing her tentacles with a blast of energy. As the Rangers pulled Carter out and closed the tomb, Diabolico's laughing spirit forced Queen Bansheera into the Shadow World, leaving her at the mercy of the imprisoned demons. Diabolico displayed strong spiritual powers, as he was able to appear in a spiritual form even when he was imprisoned and after being destroyed. He displayed some knowledge of magic, as he recognized and countered the spell used by the Sorcerer of the Sands to try and destroy Skull Cavern. One of his odder abilities allowed him to detach his hand and send it to grab distant objects before pulling them back to himself (or sending himself to his hand's location). He could also control the weather and fire energy blasts from his hands and mouths. His weapon of choice was a skull-themed staff with axe-like blades at one end, capable of firing powerful blasts of varying form. With the Star Power, Diabolico was immensely powerful; one of his energy beams was enough to put a hole through the Supertrain Megazord. Even without the Star Power, he was a competent fighter, nearly besting Olympius in their first battle. After being brainwashed by Queen Bansheera, Diabolico's eyes become pure black, with small arcs of electricity running across them periodically. In his Super Demon form, Diabolico takes on a more monstrous appearance, sprouting more spikes on his body and lengthening his existing horns. Instead of his staff, he wielded a jewel-encrusted sword as his weapon. His power was at its absolute peak in this form; alongside Olympius, he destroyed nearly all of the Rangers' Megazords, a feat that only the strongest monsters and villains in the Power Rangers franchise can achieve. Some subliminal messages suggest that Diabolico is Olympius' father: he was clearly a favorite of Bansheera (presumably an ex-lover), the other demons saw him as a kind of a king consort under their queen, and Olympius was expected to succeed him as the owner of the Star Power. Diabolico also appears as the sixth and final boss in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue for Game Boy Color. Diabolico is voiced by Neil Kaplan. =Vypra= Vypra is one of only two female demons, along with Queen Bansheera. She is the most human-looking demon, resembling a young, dark-haired woman wearing serpentine armor and bat-like wings. She is skilled in dark magic. Initially, Vypra was considered a motherly figure to the young Impus, but she began to look down on him as an immature leader after he matured into Olympius. Vypra personally led several attacks on the Rangers over the course of the series. In combat, she primarily used a thin saber that could unleash energy disks. She also piloted the Vyprari, a swift vehicle resembling a modified dune buggy. She almost never took hits, particularly because her armor does not fully cover her torso, but apparently she was vulnerable to damage, because in at least one episode, Carter was able to hold her up by threatening to shoot her. After Olympius lost favor with his mother, he discovered that she was considering making Loki and Vypra second in command. He plotted to eliminate them by having Vilevine bury them alive. Loki and Vypra retaliated by bringing back Diabolico from the dead to deal with him. Having failed in her last attempt to destroy the Rangers, Vypra was absorbed by Queen Bansheera to use her energy to regain a bodily form. In the \\"Time for Lightspeed\\" episode of Power Rangers Time Force after Bansheera's defeat, Vypra is seen emerging from a graveyard and returns from the dead with an army of undead soldiers. She teams up with the mutant Ransik to obtain an artifact called the Solar Amulet. With its Dark Magic from the Shadow World and the sun being in perfect alignment with the stars, she used its power to revive the Super Demon Quarganon in Silver Hills. However, she was killed again by Wesley Collins (Red Time Force Ranger) with his Red Battle Warrior and Quarganon by Carter with his Trans-Armor Cycle. Her resurrection is never explained. Vypra is played by Jennifer L. Yen (episodes 1; 4-37) and Wen Yann Shih (episodes 2-3).https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793390/ =Loki= Loki (pronounced \\"Low-Kai\\") is a fierce and loyal Kobold-like demon warrior and friend to Diabolico (to whom Loki gave a spider/scorpion-shaped amulet to as a token of their millennia-long friendship) and Vypra. He serves as the dumb muscle of the demons, and was considered expendable by Queen Bansheera despite his loyalty. The monsters Loki created were mainly earth-elemental, including Quakemon and Elestomp. In battle, Loki normally used a two-pronged staff as his weapon, but in \\"The Wrath of the Queen\\", the final episode he appeared in, he used a bazooka that was in the shape of a dragon's head. Loki could also expel electricity from his eyes. When Diabolico was destroyed for the first time, Loki and Vypra were anguished by his death and considered the newly matured Olympius as a mere child who would not make a suitable leader, Loki refuses to take abuse from Olympius. After losing favor with his mother, Olympius discovered that Bansheera considered making Vypra and Loki the new second in command and plotted to eliminate them by having Vilevine bury them alive. The two managed to survive and escape to where the demons were first imprisoned and brought Diabolico back to life to help get rid of Olympius. After regaining her body (at the expense of Vypra's life), Queen Bansheera allowed Loki to personally go after the Rangers, calling him her \\"favorite\\" servant. In truth, however, Loki was being used in a plan to destroy the Power Rangers when Diabolico tries to warn him; during the resulting battle, Bansheera telekinetically took control of Diabolico's body and forced him to use Loki's bazooka to take aim at the Rangers, an act that would also risk harming Loki. The Rangers managed to survive the blast, but he was fatally wounded. Loki laments that he should have listened to Diabolico and died in his arms, his body exploding and reduced to ash in the typical way monsters were destroyed. This proved to be the final straw for Diabolico, who began actively working against his queen to avenge the death of his friend. Loki is voiced by David Lodge. =Jinxer= Jinxer (whose name is based on the term \\"jinx\\") is a fly-like demon who served Queen Bansheera and her henchmen. He was highly insightful and skilled in the ways of magic. He specialized in using magic cards for various purposes such as summoning Batlings, creating monsters, and empowering or reviving fallen demons. He was also skilled in use of hypnotism and magical artifacts. He was a cowardly sort of villain, relying on his summoned monsters and Batlings, but he did battle the Rangers at least a few times. His method of attacking was using a cane-like blaster. He is extremely loyal to Olympius, supporting him even after the villain was trapped in the Shadow World. In \\"Olympius Unbound\\", Jinxer devises a plan to free the demon prince; disguising himself as hypnotist Mr. Mesmer (played by Benton Jennings), he plants an evil suggestion in Captain Mitchell's subconscious. While Olympius defeats demon spirits in the Shadow World to gain enough power to return to the living world, Jinxer puppeteers Captain Mitchell into placing a Star Power gemstone in the Aquabase's generator, diverting its power to Olympius himself. The Rangers manage to foil Olympius' plot for power, but Jinxer remains loyal, retrieving the prince's body and hiding him in a cave to tend his wounds. During the Rangers' battle against the Super Demon forms of Diabolico and Olympius, Jinxer realized that he was out of monsters and magic spell cards; a single Batling card was all that he had left. With no other ideas, he planted the card on the leg of the Lifeforce Megazord, allowing a massive army of Batlings to invade the Aquabase and commandeer the remaining Megazords. Jinxer himself and a small faction of Batlings piloted the newly repaired Omega Megazord to place a circle of stones around Mariner Bay; their goal was to assist Queen Bansheera in opening the gateway into the Shadow World. After placing the final stone, Carter and Ryan destroyed the Omega Megazord by ramming the Mobile Armor Vehicle into it; Jinxer's final fate is never on screen, but it is assumed he and some Batlings were destroyed as well. Jinxer is voiced by Kim Strauss. =Troika Demons= The Troika Demons are a trio of fallen angel-like demons that serve as Diabolico's strongest servants. He saved their cards as a last resort against the Power Rangers, only unleashing them when it seemed that Queen Bansheera was planning to transfer his Star Power to Impus if he failed her again. The Troika Demons' first attempt to destroy the Rangers involved spreading feathers from their wings across Mariner Bay - when the sun set, the feathers would explode and devastate the city. Fortunately, Lightspeed Rescue was able to retrieve almost all of the feathers (the last one was thrown away by Ryan) before the sun set. With their foes drawn into the open, the three warriors engaged the five Rangers in battle, defeating them with ease. However, they were soundly defeated in turn by Ryan, who had accepted his destiny as the Titanium Ranger. After returning to report their failure, the Troika Demons were sent back into the city to try again. This time, Diabolico provided them with two new advantages over the Rangers; Ryan had been cursed with a cobra tattoo that would eventually destroy him if he morphed too many times, and Demonite had been given a mirror card that allowed him to create a clone of himself. With these new tricks up their sleeves, the Troika Demons tried to draw the primary Rangers away from Ryan, leaving Demonite's clone to attack the weakened Titanium Ranger. However, the clone was destroyed along with his template. Despite the loss of their leader, Falkar and Thunderon were quickly redeployed against the Rangers, still proving to be a match for them. It was only after the Rangers managed to separate the demons that they finally overcame them. After Falkar and Thunderon were supersized by Diabolico, Ryan risked his life to use the Max Solarzord against the two demons when the other Rangers were having a tough time fighting them. Fitting their ranks as Diabolico's greatest minions, the Troika Demons lasted a fairly long time against the Rangers; the fight against them made up a four-episode arc in the series (from \\"Ryan's Destiny\\" to \\"The Cobra Strikes\\"). Their members include: Demonite Demonite is a demonic knight-like warrior and the leader of the trio. In battle, he equips a sword gauntlet over his right hand, which was sharp enough to slice a car in two. He could also fire lasers from his eyes. He was eventually lured into a trap by the Rangers, leaving him facing a pair of guns wielded by Carter. The Red Ranger is reluctant to shoot - largely because he would risk destroying himself - but Demonite's attempt to attack forces him to fire. Although Demonite is destroyed in the blast, Diabolico revives him as a giant, stronger, and more monstrous version where he wields two sword gauntlets and no longer wears a helmet. Demonite's advanced form is destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. His gem is red and bears an image of his sword. Demonite is voiced by David Stenstrom. Thunderon Thunderon is a hulking, green-skinned Viking/ghoul-like demon with small angel wings on his back. He attacked with his brute strength, which proved great enough to actually juggle the Rangers in the air if he got a hold of them. His gauntlets were equipped with spiked knuckles to increase his punching power, and he could shoot green electricity from his eyes. He seemingly managed to defeat the Rangers, but they were faking defeat in order to blast him at a close range with their V-Lancers. Thunderon was destroyed by a second combined blast, but Diabolico revived him as a giant. Unlike his comrades, his appearance did not change in the process. Despite getting backup from a reluctant Falkar, Thunderon is destroyed the Max Solarzord. His gem is green and bears an image of one of his fists. Thunderon is voiced by Alonzo Bodden. Falkar Falkar is an elf/falcon-themed warrior. He behaved in an effeminate manner and used a three-pronged staff, which he could use to stab opponents or as a base for a high-speed spinning kick. He could also fire blue energy beams from the eyes of his falcon-helmet. While battling the Rangers alongside Thunderon, Falkar is lured into an old building by the Pink and Yellow Rangers and buried under rubble. By the time Falkar dug himself out, the Rangers had engaged a giant Thunderon with their Megazord. Although Falkar attempts to stay on the sidelines, planning to have Thunderon do the work of defeating the Rangers and take credit for it, Diabolico finds him and advises that he joins the fight. Falkar states that he'd like to see how Thunderon does first. Diabolico insists anyway and uses an Advanced Growth Card on Falkar to force his cowardly minion into the fight. The card merged Falkar with his helmet, giving him a draconic-like form where he gains super-strength and can perform a more powerful spinning kick with the help of his staff. Falkar is destroyed by the Max Solarzord. His gem is brown and bears an image of one of the wings on his shin plates. Falkar is voiced by Ezra Weisz. Troika After each Troika demon was destroyed, their bodies transformed into a colored gem that returned to Diabolico's possession. Using these gems, Diabolico revives his minions and fuses them into Troika, a powerful chimeric warrior with white feathers/fur covering most of his body. The faces of his component demons are all present on different sides of his head with Demonite's face in the center, Thunderon's face on the left side of his head, and Falkar's face on the right side of his head. His body includes Demonite's right arm and sword, Thunderon's left arm, and Falkar's feet, the chest is black and bears all three of the Troika Demons' gems over a white visage resembling screaming ghosts. Troika combines the best abilities of his components giving him Thunderon's incredible strength, Demonite's skill, and Falkar's speed. His main attacks include firing energy blasts from his sword arm and moving at high speed while spinning like a top. The Rangers had a hard time fighting Troika. Luckily for the Rangers, Miss Fairweather is able to provide them with the Battle Boosters in their next battle, allowing them to overcome and destroy Troika. Troika speaks with the voices of Demonite, Thunderon, and Falkar in unison. =Triskull= Triskull is a demon warrior who swears allegiance to Trakeena. He is the leader of the Ghouls, foot soldiers Trakeena uses with the destruction of her Sting Wingers. He pretends to aid Olympius in collecting energy for Queen Bansheera, but is actually collecting it so Trakeena can return to her insectoid form. He attempts to stop the Rangers from entering the building where the energy is kept and is destroyed by the Red Galaxy and Lightspeed Rangers. Triskull's power is highly inconsistent since in the episode before his death, he easily defeated all Galaxy and Lightspeed Rangers. Unlike most villains and monsters, Triskull did not explode after being killed by the Rangers. This is due to his Super Sentai counterpart not doing so. Triskull is voiced by Michael Sorich. =Batlings= The Batlings are bat-like foot soldiers who are summoned from Jinxer's cards to act as the bulk of their forces. They resemble MMPR's Putty Patrollers, but have black outfits, large goggles on their eyes, and small bat wings on their helmets and backs. They use small swords in combat, and occasionally display the ability to transform into bats for ambushes. =Demons= The following monsters are conjured by Diabolico and his forces through Demon Cards. To make a demon grow, Jinxer would throw a magic card into their body (or their shattered remains) and cast an incantation, transforming the demon's body into a cloud of bats that coalesce into a larger form. If an Advanced Growth card is used, the demon can manifest in an even stronger form. Queen Bansheera displayed the ability to empower monsters in a similar fashion by planting her tentacles in their bodies. She can also seal their minds away to transform them into obedient servants. When a demon is destroyed, its spirit is sent to the Shadow World where the demons become a largely mindless husk of its former self only concerned with destroying everything it sees (a trait made more threatening by the fact that it cannot be killed with it being already dead). * Ghouligan (voiced by Ken Merckx) - A fire-based demon. After Carter got a glimpse of him during his firefighting job, Ghouligan and the Batlings attacked Mariner Bay. This monster was destroyed by the Rangers' Rescue Blasters. * Magmavore (voiced by Kim Strauss in the first appearance, David Lodge in the second appearance) - A giant lava golem that appeared from a meteor that crashed into Mariner Bay summoned by Jinxer. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. Magmavore was later reawakened in a stronger form by Queen Bansheera where this form now wields a massive club. This monster was destroyed again by the Supertrain Megazord. * Quakemon - A giant earthquake-based antlion demon with a dual face that is summoned by Loki and Jinxer. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. * Whirlin (voiced by John C. Hyke) - A tornado-based bat-like demon selected by Diabolico. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. * Fireor (voiced by Bob Papenbrook) - A sword-wielding fire-based gargoyle demon conjured by Impus who can perform fire and heat attacks. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. * Gold-Beaked Monster (voiced by Neil Kaplan) - A vampire bat demon. * Elestomp (voiced by Stephen Apostolina) - An elephant demon selected by Loki. This monster was destroyed by the Unilaser. * Strikning (voiced by Eddie Frierson) - A lightning-based demon that battled both the Cyborg Rangers (which were created by General McKnight's scientists) and the originals. Strikning could fire the spikes from his body to act as lightning rods. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. * Smogger (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz) - A gas-based demon selected by Vypra. Smogger hurls explosive orbs at buildings that causes them to be set on fire. This monster was destroyed by the Red Ranger's Lightspeed Cycle and Rescue Speeder. * Trifire (voiced by Dave Mallow) - A fire-breathing three- headed dragon demon created by Impus to cause Mt. Jasmine to erupt. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. Trifire was later resurrected by Queen Bansheera in a stronger dragon-like form where he wields a double-bladed sword, gains stronger armor, and can shoot lightning out of his three heads. This monster was destroyed again by the Supertrain Megazord. * Liztwin (voiced by Archie Kao) - A skeletal dinosaur/dragon-like demon with a dragon head for a right hand that was unleashed by Vypra to distract the Rangers while Ryan escaped. His advanced form has larger horns, two extra small horns, a back sail in place of his back spikes, and a large right hand with long knife-like claws on it in place of the dragon head. This monster was destroyed by the Supertrain Megazord. * Demonite Clone (voiced by David Stenstrom) - After the Troika Monsters were defeated in battle against the Titanium Ranger, Diabolico gave the apologetic Demonite a special Mirror Card to aid the him and his fellow monsters in the battle against the Rangers. When Demonite used the Mirror Card, it created a clone of himself. This clone almost exactly resembles the original Demonite except he possessed two sword gauntlets instead of one and had a blue visor. * Cobra Monster (voiced by Richard Cansino) - A cobra demon with cobra-headed hands that was associated with the Cobra Tattoo that Diabolico placed on Ryan's back. Once the Cobra Monster was destroyed by Ryan, the Cobra Tattoo on him disappeared. * Thunderclaw (voiced by Bob Papenbrook) - A stag beetle demon that aided Vypra in a failed attempt to infiltrate the Lightspeed Aquabase. He can emit electricity from his horns. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Solarzord. * Shockatron (voiced by Herbie Baez) - An electronic demon sent to destroy electronic plants. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. * Spellbinder (voiced by Kirk Thornton) - A mystical wizard demon. With the planets aligned, Spellbinder performs the ritual to bring back Queen Bansheera. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Solarzord. * Moleman (voiced by Ken Merckx) - A dog/mole demon who invented a laser powered by Vypra's stolen Starlight Crystals. This monster was destroyed by the V-Lancers. * Cyclopter (voiced by Richard Epcar) - A cyclops demon created by Loki when he was challenged by Olympius to create a worthy monster. This monster was destroyed by the Omega Megazord. * Mantevil (voiced by Michael McConnohie) - A powerful praying mantis demon who accompanied Olympius in an attack upon downtown Mariner Bay. This monster was destroyed by the Omega Megazord, the Lightspeed Solarzord, and the Supertrain Megazord. * Vilevine (voiced by Kim Strauss) - A rafflesia/ivy demon unleashed by Olympius. This monster was destroyed by the Omega Megazord. * Freezard (voiced by Steve McGowan) - An ice-spewing cobra-like demon unleashed by Olympius. Any monster sucked into Freezard gets trapped in his frigid stomach where they will slowly become frozen. This monster was destroyed by the Omega Megazord. * Infinitor (voiced by Paul Schrier) - A powerful dragon/lizard-like warrior who strongly resembles his creator Olympius. This monster was destroyed by the Omega Megazord using the Lightspeed Sword. * Monster Egg - This egg was said to hatch into a very powerful stingray-like monster that would destroy whatever it saw. * Birdbane (voiced by Michael Sorich) - A goofy jungle crow demon that was summoned by Jinxer to help reclaim the Monster Egg. Birdbane was the self- proclaimed \\"King of Winged Demon Creatures\\". His advanced form sports a knight-like helmet and shoulder pads. This monster was destroyed by the Supertrain Megazord. * Memorase (voiced by Marc Caldera) - A memory-erasing killer whale demon sent by Diabolico. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Solarzord. He is voiced by Marc Caldera. * Gatekeeper (voiced by Michael Sorich) - The Gatekeeper of the Shadow World is an entity guarding the gateway between Skull Castle and the Shadow World. Olympius summoned the Gatekeeper for help to rid himself of the Rangers for good. The Gatekeeper was able to summon the spirits of past monsters with his staff and control them. His ultimate fate is unknown as he escapes the Shadow World with Olympius and grows large, but is not destroyed on-screen. This monster was presumably destroyed off-screen by the Omega Megazord and Lightspeed Solarzord. * Furnace Monster - A defeated barnacle demon in the Shadow World summoned by the Gatekeeper who was able to chase the Rangers. * Mummy Demon - A defeated unnamed mummy demon in the Shadow World summoned by the Gatekeeper. * Flower Demon A defeated unnamed flower demon in the Shadow World summoned by the Gatekeeper. * Moth Demon A defeated unnamed moth demon. His advanced form appeared in the Shadow World summoned by the Gatekeeper. * Mermatron A female bat-winged siren/mermaid demon. Her advanced form has her sporting new armor, a mask, and a fish tail-shaped sickle for a right hand. This demon was named in the video game. Her advanced form appeared as a defeated demon in the Shadow World that was summoned by Gatekeeper. * Aquafiend (voiced by Peter Greenwood) - A kappa demon summoned by Diabolico. According to Diabolico, Aquafiend was the only demon monster that was not affected by water like the other demons were. In fact, Aquafiend lived in the waters of a lagoon near Mariner Bay. Diabolico summoned Aquafiend to retrieve Neptune's trident and use it to drain all the water from Mariner Bay so the demons could attack the Aquabase undeterred. This monster was destroyed by the Omega Megazord. * Arachnor (voiced by Catherine Battistone) - A spider demon. This monster was destroyed by the Red Ranger's Trans-Armor Mode. * Treevil (voiced by John C. Hyke) - A tree demon created by Jinxer when he used a monster card on a nearby tree. Treevil can throw explosive acorns around like grenades and has super- strength enough to uproot a tree and use it as a club. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. * Abominus - A slimy demon supposedly possessing ice-based powers.

Connery has performed stunt-work in films. He has also acted as the stunt-double for Gary Oldman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Rowan Atkinson, and John Hurt. He is acknowledged as the first skydiver to land after a wingsuit jump without using a parachute. He made his first parachute jump at age 23, as part of his army training. He was the stunt-double of the Queen during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics. He has performed 880 skydives and 450 BASE jumps. He has jumped from locations such as the Eiffel Tower, Nelson's Column, the London Eye, London's Tower Bridge, and from inside the Millennium Dome. Eiffel Tower Connery jumped through the centre of the Eiffel Tower on a rainy day with winds gusting at 25 mph (40 km/h). Nelson's Column On 9 May 2003 Connery jumped off Nelson's Column at Trafalgar Square in Central London in what was described as a \\"death-defying protest stunt\\" which was organised by Act For Tibet, in support of the Dalai Lama. He climbed the monument without a safety harness and jumped from the top, landing using a parachute. At the end of the jump he was arrested along with three other protesters. Connery admitted that the jump was \\"frightening\\". Connery was the first person to jump from Nelson's Column because up to that point the height of the monument was viewed as insufficient to allow for a successful jump. World's first wingsuit landing without a parachute On 23 May 2012 Connery made his wingsuit jump from a helicopter flying at a height of over Ridge Wood in Buckinghamshire near his hometown of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Coming back from California (Perris Valley) in 2003, where he did his first wingsuit flight, he said: \\"that could be landed!\\" and he went for a week to do wingsuit flight training at Empuriabrava on the coast of Spain, the largest dropzone in Europe. Before the final attempt, he had made two test flights landing with a parachute. He had also trained for weeks in Italy and Switzerland in preparation for the jump. He had to obtain permission from the Civil Aviation Authority for the dive. The flight was filmed by Mark Sutton. =Flight= Three seconds into his record-setting flight, his wingsuit inflated, its airflow dynamics enabled controlled gliding, and his speed reached about . At approximately over the landing strip, he changed the configuration of his wingsuit so as to decrease the gliding and vertical (falling) components of his velocity to and respectively. Just before the final approach, Connery briefly appeared to lose control but quickly recovered. For added safety during landing, Connery wore a neck brace. =Landing= Connery landed safely on a strip made of approximately 18,600 cardboard boxes. The landing strip area was long by wide and its maximum height was . The landing strip included separate layers each featuring cardboard boxes with varying dimensions. It took Connery about thirty seconds to emerge from the cardboard boxes. Connery mentioned that although on the way down he experienced turbulence, the landing was \\"soft and comfortable\\". The landing was attended by about a hundred spectators. The landing rig, also known as the box rig, was constructed on the outskirts of Henley on Thames. =Reaction= Landing in a wingsuit without using a parachute had been one of Jeb Corliss's main objectives since 2010. Corliss and other top-level wingsuit jumpers had tried for years to design wingsuits similar to the one which Connery helped design and subsequently used for his record-setting leap. In the beginning, Corliss thought that Connery's stunt was an April Fool's joke and that the stunt Connery was attempting was impossible. Corliss added that Connery's landing was \\"one of the most amazing things\\" he had seen in his life and called it the \\"greatest stunt ever performed\\". He also added that \\"he bears no ill will toward the man who stole his dream\\" and that he goes by the Samurai code by giving respect to his opponent. Corliss also expressed surprise that Connery chose to land head- first, risking a neck injury. The New York Times has compared Connery's jump to a superhero's. Flying magazine has called the jump a \\"history-making stunt\\" and mentioned that Connery had confidence he would succeed because of the \\"excellent control\\" he had over his suit. The commentary also added that the risk factors should not be underestimated. Connery's landing was studied as an extreme example of the effectiveness of shock absorbing material. Rhett Allain, associate professor of Physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, has analysed Connery's flight in Wired magazine's science blog Dot Physics to determine the landing velocities which allowed Connery to remain uninjured. Connery received a nomination for the Epic TV Adventurer of The Year Award. Queen's stunt double The plot of one of the skits during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics had the Queen go on a secret mission with James Bond played by Daniel Craig. During the mission, the Queen was supposed to ride a helicopter with Bond and parachute at the stadium during the Olympic ceremonies. Connery acted as the Queen's stunt double. During the night of the opening ceremonies, the helicopter carrying Connery and Mark Sutton, who acted as James Bond's double, was given permission to take-off at 8:50 p.m. local time and was then directed to the stadium where it assumed a position, hovering at a height of . Connery, wearing a salmon dress similar to the one worn by the Queen during the Olympic ceremonies, along with a blond wig, jumped out of the helicopter as did Sutton. Connery then deployed the parachute at revealing a Union Flag canopy. Shortly after, the real Queen entered London's Olympic stadium to applause. Connery landed at a nearby bridge. Connery had trained for months for the stunt in the early morning hours to keep it secret. In preparation for the stunt, he met with Angela Kelly, the Queen's dresser so that she could make a replica of the Queen's dress for him and the Queen made her favourite black handbag available to make the stunt look more realistic. Films Connery has performed stunts and appeared on television and films such as Die Another Day, The Beach, Batman Begins, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Family life Connery was married to Vivienne, a café owner in Henley-on-Thames, and they have one child.

The range is a narrow sub-range, and an extension north, at the northeast of the Hualapai Mountains massif, which lies to the southwest. The range is defined by the Hualapai Valley to the northwest, and north and south-flowing washes on its east border, associated with faults and cliffs; the Cottonwood Cliffs (Cottonwood Mountains) are due east, and are connected to the Aquarius Cliffs southward at the west perimeter of the Aquarius Mountains; the cliffs are a result of the Aquarius Fault, which is an extension southward from the Grand Wash Cliffs and Grand Wash Fault which crosses the Colorado River at Lake Mead, and the west perimeter of the Grand Canyon/Colorado Plateau. Description The Peacock Mountains, are a smaller, lower elevation range, only about 10-mi (16 km) wide. Peacock Peak (Arizona), is the range highpoint, in the approximate center of the range, with a ridgeline north to the range terminus (13-mi). At the north terminus, Arizona State Route 66 transits northeast to southeast around the range; the Grand Wash Cliffs lie due north; the northwest-trending Hualapai Valley extends from the terminus, and the Grand Wash Cliffs form its east border, also forming the southwest border of the Music Mountains; the cliffs extend approximately 100-mi northwards approaching southwest Utah. The east side of the Peacock Mountains are defined by due-north and due-south flowing drainages on the west of the Cottonwood Cliffs. At the approximate mountain range center, a water divide finds Hackberry Wash flowing due-north to Truxton Wash, which descends from the northeast, (off east Music Mountains, and west region Aubrey Valley). Truxton Wash meets the northeast of the Peacock Mountains, then turns due northwest at the Peacock Mountains foothills, to enter the southeast of Hualapai Valley. At the southeast of the Peacock Mountains, the headwaters of the south-flowing Knight Creek begins. Within 25-mi from the water divide the creek becomes the Big Sandy River. The southern section of the Peacock Mountains also widens to about 14-mi, with McCarrys Wash feeding east off the northeast of the Hualapai Mountains, and numerous other washes feeding from the south and southeast off the Peacock Mountains into Knight Creek. Vegetation communities The Peacock Mountains lie at a regional confluence of five vegetation biotic communities.Kamilli, R. J, Richard, S. M. eds. 1998. Vegetation Biotic Communities of Arizona, from Geologic Highway Map of Arizona, from Reynolds, c. 1988) Mohave Desertscrub has a limit to the north (in the Grand Canyon, along the Colorado River), and is located northwest, west, and southwest of the Peacock Mountains/Kingman, Arizona region; also northwest, at the north of Hualapai Valley. To the south, the north limits of the 'Arizona Upland Sonoran Desert-scrub' is found up the Big Sandy River and its tributaries, which is north-south along the Aquarius Fault, the fault being the Grand Wash Cliffs southern extension. Another lower elevation community is the Semidesert Grassland, found especially in southeast Arizona, (middle elevation locales, Madrean Sky Islands region, Cochise County), but the zone extends northwestwards along the Arizona transition zone mountains and valleys, higher elevation grassland at the base of the northwest-by-southeast lineage of the Mogollon Rim, and associated ridges or plateaus (Mogollon Plateau); the Semidesert Grassland reaches its terminus northwest up the Big Sandy River and west to the Sacramento Valley at the west of Kingman, and northwards up into Detrital Valley. =Great Basin Grassland, Great Basin Conifer Woodland= Two higher elevation biotic communities find their west limits at the Peacock Mountains region. Upstream up Truxton Wash to the northeast, is a region of Plains and Great Basin Grassland along the Truxton Wash and mountain foothills; further east and northeast, on the west of the Coconino Plateau, (Hualapai Indian Reservation, and Aubrey Valley region), a large mostly continuous expanse of the grassland exists. The grassland is surrounded and intermixed with the 2nd higher elevation biotic community, Great Basin Conifer Woodland. Together, the woodland and the grassland encompass almost the entire north half of Arizona except for specific regions of desert (Painted Desert, the Great Basin Desertscrub, on the Colorado Plateau, or associated perimeter regions). Other exceptions are the highpoint communities of trees or alpine grasslands at the San Francisco Peaks region, or the Kaibab Plateau on the Grand Canyon North Rim, or a few other higher altitude locales. (The exceptions are the Subalpine Grassland, found especially in the White Mountains, or small areas at the San Francisco Peaks, and the Rocky Mountain Subalpine Conifer Forest found at both the White Mountains and San Francisco Peaks.)

Indian Railways upgrade this station with modern facilities. History Malda Town railway station at night In the early 1960s, when Farakka Barrage was being constructed, a radical change was made in the railway system north of the Ganges. Indian Railways created a new broad-gauge rail link from Kolkata. The long Farakka Barrage carries a rail-cum-road bridge across the Ganges. The rail bridge was opened in 1971 thereby linking the Barharwa–Azimganj–Katwa loop to Malda, New Jalpaiguri and other railway stations in North Bengal. =Busy station= Malda Town railway station is amongst the top hundred booking stations of Indian Railways. One of the reasons for it being a busy station is that every train that passes through the station stops here since it is the meeting point of two railway zones (i.e. The Eastern Railway and the Northeast Frontier Railway). To the north of the station starts the Northeast Frontier Railway and to the south starts the Eastern Railway. Malda Town railway station platform Malda railway division Malda railway division is one of the four railway divisions under the Eastern Railway zone of Indian Railways.

Time Force Power Rangers The Time Force Rangers The Time Force Rangers are fictional characters and heroes in the Power Rangers universe, appearing in the television series Power Rangers Time Force. They are members of the Time Force organization, law-enforcement officers sent from the future to prevent changes in the past. =Wesley \\"Wes\\" Collins= Wesley Collins is the main protagonist of the series. He is the Red Time Force Ranger and second-in- command of the team. He pilots Time Flyer 1 and his primary weapons are his Chrono Sabers and the V1 Vector Weapon. Even though technically, Jennifer is the leader of the team, as Red Ranger, Wes is considered an informal field leader, ever since regaining the Red Chrono Morpher from Alex. A similar situation was used in Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers in which the female character Delphine, the White Ranger, is the leader, but stories revolved around the Blue Ranger, Cestro. Wes is a rich kid from Silver Hills that was chosen to become the Red Time Force Ranger by Jennifer in order to unlock the rest of the Chrono Morphers due to his DNA matching the original Red Time Force Ranger, Alex. After unlocking the Chrono Morphers, Jennifer takes back the Chrono Morpher until he proves himself. Wes eventually develops feeling for Jennifer, but put those feeling on hold when her thought-to-be-dead fiancée, Alex comes to present day to take over the team. According to Alex, Wes' father is supposed to die of his injuries inflicted by Ransik and Wes is to take over the company, which he does do for a time. Wes proves capable of being in charge of the company, but returns to the Rangers, saving them from Frax and reacquiring his morpher from Alex who, despite telling Wes of his father's fate himself, saves Mr. Collins with future technology. Wes finally reconciles with his father who supports him being the Red Ranger. Wes also falls in love with Jennifer but is hesitant to reveal his affection for fear that Jennifer does not reciprocate it. The return of Alex only further agitates Wes into believing this. In the finale, Wes forces the other Rangers to return to the future as Alex reveals that they will die as they fight against Ransik, Frax, Doomtron, and the Cyclobot army, even with Eric's help. After Alex reveals that Wes saves the city but dies doing it, the other Rangers return to help him and together they defeat the Cyclobot army. Wes destroys Doomtron and Frax with the Q-Rex (which he has control of as Eric gave him the Quantum Morpher) and is the only one that lands a real hit on Ransik using his Red Battle Fire Armor. Ultimately Ransik surrenders and the other Rangers have to return to the future. Wes sadly says goodbye to the other Rangers and he and Jennifer profess their love, but she has no choice but to return to the future. Wes retains his Red Ranger powers and is offered command of the Silver Guardians (now protecting the city for free) which he accepts on the condition that the recovered Eric is his partner. In Power Rangers Wild Force, Wes and Eric, now best friends, team up with the Wild Force Rangers to defeat the Mut-Orgs. Wes is reunited with the rest of the team, and the repentant Nadira and Ransik, but is upset with Jennifer who has been in the past for a while and never contacted him. The two reunite and still clearly in love each other, though it is left unrevealed if she remains in the past with him or returns to the future. Wes helps destroy the Mut-Orgs after Ransik destroys their mutant sides and celebrates the victory with the Time Force and Wild Force Rangers as well Nadira and the now fully human Ransik. During Forever Red, Wes and Eric team-up against the remnants of the Machine Empire with 8 other Red Rangers and helps defeat them. He would return again later to join the veteran Ranger army in Power Rangers Super Megaforce, and again for the 25th anniversary special in Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel. Wes is played by Jason Faunt. =Jennifer \\"Jen\\" Scotts= Jennifer Scotts is the female protagonist of the series. She is the Pink Time Force Ranger and the leader of the team. She pilots Time Flyer 5 and her primary weapons are her Chrono Sabers and the V5 Vector Weapon. After the capture of the villain Ransik, Jennifer's boyfriend, Alex, proposes to her only to be killed the next day. She vows to avenge Alex and capture Ransik, who escapes. Just like Wes, Jennifer is a very skilled hand-to-hand fighter, even without her Ranger powers. She takes the Pink, Blue, Green and Yellow Chrono Morphers and goes back in time to 2001. Jennifer is a cold, strict, no-nonsense leader to the Rangers, and while getting to know them better, her attitude changes and she is shown to have a calm and carefree side. She eventually ends her engagement with Alex when it is revealed that he is still alive, as she has fallen in love with Wes. When Jennifer and the other Time Force Rangers reunite to help Wild Force Rangers battle the Mut-Orgs, she is paired up with White Tiger Ranger Alyssa Enrilè. She traveled back in time before her other teammates from the year 3001 to track the Mut-Orgs, and later saved Wes, Eric, and the Wild Force Rangers from the trio of villains. She would then find herself in the unlikely position of accepting Ransik and Nadira's help against the creatures, but decided to give her old foes a second chance. She and her teammates later return as part of the veteran Ranger army to battle the Armada. Jennifer is played by Erin Cahill. =Trip Regis= Trip is the Green Time Force Ranger and a native of the planet Xybria (which makes him the third non-human main core Ranger). He pilots Time Flyer 3 and his primary weapons are his Chrono Sabers and the V3 Vector Weapon. Thanks to a green gem embedded in his forehead, he has the ability to read minds, pinpoint locations, and see the future in some instances. Green-haired, Trip is the naive member of the team, since his society is one without secrets. As such, he is sometimes gullible, leading to negative consequences. When blending in while in Wes' time period, Trip wears a hat to hide his Xybrian features. Trip looks up to the other Rangers, but is a good Ranger in his own right. He is also a technological genius, having created the Electro Booster weapon and other arsenal. He can be considered the brains of the team. Trip is also willing to stand up for what he believes is right, such as when he tried to protect a mutant named Notacon (who did not want to be evil) from being destroyed by Eric Myers just because Notacon was a mutant. Trip even put himself on the line to protect the poor mutant, and Eric deliberately missed the pair, sparing them. Trip was in part responsible for Nadira's reform. He forced her to help a woman in labor and the sight of the newborn made Nadira rethink her ways. Trip was sent back to the future by Wes, but accompanied the others back to the present to help him fight. He later returned with the other Time Force Rangers to battle the Mut-Orgs alongside the Wild Force Power Rangers in \\"Reinforcements from the Future\\". He also joined the team in helping the Megaforce Rangers in their final battle with the Armada. Trip is played by Kevin Kleinberg. =Katie Walker= Katie Walker is the Yellow Time Force Ranger. She pilots Time Flyer 4 and her primary weapons are her Chrono Sabers and the V4 Vector Weapon. Gifted with unnatural strength that might be the product of genetic engineering, Katie is always open with her feelings, a sharp contrast to the conservative Jennifer. Katie likes to hug her fellow Ranger really tightly, which is a habit of hers. She is shown to be very affectionate and loving to her teammates, especially to Trip, who she is seen usually hugging, being overly protective of, and consoling him. She loves her family a lot so she was devastated to hear that the future was being altered, and feared what could happen to them. After returning to the future, she comes back one more time to help fight the Mut-Orgs. Katie partnered with her fellow Yellow Rangers, Kelsey Winslow from Lightspeed Rescue and Taylor Earhardt in Wild Force. She would also appear as part of the Ranger army in Super Megaforce. Katie is played by Deborah Estelle Philips. =Lucas Kendall= Lucas Kendall is the Blue Time Force Ranger. He pilots Time Flyer 2 and his primary weapons are her Chrono Sabers and the V2 Vector Weapon. He is vainly obsessed with two things: his looks and cars. In the year 3000, he is a race car driver, and acts as a big brother to Trip. Lucas is also \\"cool\\", the sort of guy whom everyone seems jealous of, and seems to be a big hit with the ladies. After the Time Force Rangers return to the future, they later come back to assist the Wild Force Rangers in battling the Mut-Orgs. Lucas goes back to the future, revealing a possible romance between him and Nadira who had liked him at least as far back as \\"Nadira's Dream Date\\". He also apparently set her up so she did not have to go to prison by presumably getting her community service or something similar. When neither Jennifer nor Wes are around to lead the team he usually leads the rest. He would later return again as part of the Ranger army in Super Megaforce. Lucas is played by Michael Copon. =Eric Myers= Eric Myers is the Quantum Ranger, the sixth Ranger of the Time Force Power Rangers. He pilots the Quantasaurus Rex and his primary weapon is the Quantum Defender. Eric is first seen as a soldier working for the Silver Guardians, an organization established by Mr. Collins to protect Bio-Lab. Wes later reveals that they attended the same private school. Whereas Wes came from a rich family, Eric worked hard and was dirt poor, and eventually decided to leave the school, saying that he had \\"bigger plans\\". Eric was resentful for having to work so hard while Wes did not have to work at all. From this, Eric grew bitter and had few friends, although Wes tried to befriend him on several occasions. After discovering that Wes is the Red Time Force Ranger, Eric attempts to find his own powers. He becomes aware that the Time Force Rangers are looking for the Quantum Ranger power and he gets to it first, registering his voice on the Quantum Morpher so only he can use it. When Wes attempts to retrieve the Quantum Morpher from him out of general distrust by the Time Force team, he and Eric fight; the latter wins. As a result, the Rangers have no choice but to accept his control of the Morpher. Wes later accompanies him in a journey back in time to find the Quantum Ranger's Megazord, the Q-Rex. Time Force HQ, aids Eric, by giving him new powers. After the previous leader of the Silver Guardians was injured in action, Eric was able to eventually gain control of the Q-Rex enough for Mr. Collins to promote him to being the leader of the Silver Guardians, much to the Rangers (mostly Wes') dismay. Eric becomes a reluctant ally to the regular Rangers, remaining separate and occasionally aiding them at certain times. His peers often find his methods intimidating, but deep down they know he is almost always taking the best approach. Unlike Wes, Eric works alone and never lets anyone push him around. Eric acts more like lone wolf leader. As time goes by, Eric makes a new friend in the form of a young girl named Alice, who serves as his loyal companion in his lonely hours and the Rangers learn to trust Eric. He is later known for commanding fanatic loyalty from his comrades and is known for pulling his team together when beginning a new mission. During the end of the series, Eric is severely injured by a laser shot from a Cyclobot after taking a shot meant for Wes and Mr. Collins and he hands his Morpher over to Wes. He recovers though, and becomes co-leader of the Silver Guardians with Wes who was offered command, but accepted only under the condition that Eric was his partner. The two from then on led the Silver Guardians (now working for free) in protecting the city from threats. Eric later makes a few other appearances. Now best friends with Wes, he teams up with the other Time Force Rangers in the team-up battle with the Wild Force Power Rangers, who are trying to stop a trio of Mutant-Org hybrids. During this time, he develops a love relationship with Taylor Earhardt (the Yellow Wild Force Ranger). He is also one of ten Red Rangers to battle in the episode Forever Red, which celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Power Rangers franchise. His Zord (the Q-Rex) was later reclaimed by Time Force, and reconstructed for the use of the Super Megaforce Silver Ranger in Power Rangers Super Megaforce. Eric himself would later join the Ranger army in the final battle with the Armada. Eric is played by Daniel Southworth. Allies=Alex Drake= Alex is the former Red Time Force Ranger, and Jennifer's former fiancé. He is the descendant of Wesley Collins who is known for doing everything by the book and is obsessed with his job. He is supposedly killed by Ransik in the first episode yet barely survives. After his recovery, Alex may have been promoted to high-ranking position as he is referred to as \\"sir\\" by his former commanding officer. On occasion, he secretly helped the Rangers from a small dark room in Time Force HQ. He sends the Time Shadow from this command system and keeps a close eye on the \\"past\\". He may have also been behind Eric's Mega Battle mode. When he officially resurfaces, he intends to restore the future to the way it is after the events that occur have shifted the timeline. So he temporarily reclaims the Red Time Force Ranger powers from Wes. The other Rangers later ask him to give the Red Ranger powers back to Wes, who can inspire the team as Alex can't during the battle with Dragontron who he can't defeat. After Wes saves them from Frax and destroys the energy siphon Alex is trying to take out, he reluctantly hands his morpher over to Wes. Unlike Alex, Wes is easily able to defeat Dragontron using an unorthodox method. Afterwards, he realizes that Wes was right about the future, that it could be changed and doing the right thing, he saves Wes' father's life when Alex has earlier revealed that he is fated to die (Wes' father was gravely injured by Ransik). When Jennifer is in trouble, Circuit contacts Alex and he sent Wes the Strata Cycle, telling him that Wes needs to protect Jennifer for him since he is not there, showing that despite the cold way he has treated Jennifer when he comes to the past, Alex still loves her. When the Rangers are forced to return to the future by Wes after learning they would die in battle, Alex reveals to them that Wes will die in the battle to defeat Ransik and takes them to have their memories of the past erased. Ultimately the Rangers decide to go back and help Wes, though Alex is against it. He is hurt when he realizes Jennifer has come to love Wes, as she returns the engagement ring. Unable to stop her, Alex tells the Rangers to use the Time Force Megazord in Jet Mode to reach the past instead of the Time Ship as the Megazord has the best chance of making it through the vortex when things are so unstable in the past. Alex is played by Jason Faunt. =Alice Roberts= Alice is a young girl who is one of Eric's neighbors and serves as a companion for him in his lonely hours. She makes her first appearance in \\"Quantum Secrets\\". She came over to Eric when she saw him outside feeding his two birds in a cage and asked Eric if she could talk to the birds. Startled by her appearance, Eric told her she could. Alice was pleased and while playing with his birds, she told Eric that everyone should have a friend, startling Eric even more. Alice and Eric's conversation was interrupted by the arrival of three men. The leader of the trio told Eric that he had to come with them, which he did reluctantly. Later on, Conwing was attacking Silver Hills. Alice raced over into Eric's backyard and rescued his birds. The following day, Alice returned to Eric's backyard as she had spotted him sitting dejectedly. Alice told him that she had the birds and proudly told him that she had rescued them. Eric was relieved to see his birds and told Alice that she was very brave, which she took in good stride. Eric told Alice that she could come and visit the birds any time she wanted, to which she was very happy about. He helped Alice up to get a closer looker at the birds. She chatted with Eric about friendship and with a heartfelt look on his face, Eric found his tough exterior softening in Alice's presence. Alice makes one more appearance in \\"Destiny Defeated\\". She ran up the sidewalk when she noticed Eric standing with his bird cage and luggage. She went up to the bird cage and started to play with the birds. Alice asked Eric if he was leaving, which he was. Eric told her that he was giving the birds to her and she cheered up right away. Alice gave Eric a hug, telling him that she was going to miss him very much. Eric was startled at first by the sweet sincerity of affection from Alice, but then he felt touched, smiled and returned the hug. A taxi pulled up and Eric tossed his luggage inside. Eric patted Alice on the head and then entered the taxi. The taxi drove off and Alice waved to Eric and he returned the wave until they were out of sight. She is never seen after this but it is known that she has Eric's birds. Alice is played by Darcy O'Donnell. =Circuit= Circuit is a small robotic owl who serves as the Rangers' technical adviser, much in the vein of Alpha 5. He informs them of the weapons at their disposal, performs diagnostics on their equipment, and sends word to the future to send the Time Force Megazord whenever a mutant grows. When he is not performing Intel for the Rangers, he frequently resides in Trip's backpack. He also informs the Rangers of the first change to history, which is Mr. Collins' company creating a combat machine to fight back against Ransik. Circuit once tried to access information on the immediate future for the Rangers, but Alex saw this attempt and immediately made the information unavailable to prevent any changes to the timeline; this effort, of course, was rendered moot as the events Circuit saw came to pass. Circuit believed he had become faulty and useless to the Rangers, temporarily leaving them until a transmission from Alex convinced him that it was not his fault. Circuit is voiced by Brianne Siddall. =Albert Collins= Albert Collins is Wes' wealthy father, owner of Bio Lab, and founder of the Silver Guardians. Wes left his father to make a name for himself, but Mr. Collins saw him as a failure. He then focused his efforts on advancing Bio Lab technology by examining the Quantum powers, and creating Trizyrium Crystals. In effort to protect Silver Hills from Ransik's forces, Mr. Collins created the Silver Guardians. When Mr. Collins discovered that his son was the Red Ranger, things changed. He became proud of his son for breaking away from him and making his own future. He even stood up to Ransik, who attacked Bio Lab for the antidote to Venomark's bite. He tells Ransik that he'd have flushed the serum down the drain if he knew that it was keeping the mutant alive. When Ransik taunts him about his own rejection in Wes not following his footsteps, Mr. Collins tells him that he is proud of Wes regardless and loves him. He is then heavily injured by an energy blast from Ransik and taken to the hospital. When Alex shows up from the future, he reveals that Mr. Collins will die the next day and that Wes' destiny is to take over Bio-Lab from him. Wes takes control of Bio Lab at the insistence of Doctor Zaskin, but is not happy there and returns to the Rangers after learning from Doctor Zaskin that his father was proud of him for being a Ranger. While Wes leads the Rangers in destroying Dragontron, Mr. Collins nearly dies as predicted, but is saved by Alex with future technology as Wes made Alex see the future is not set in stone. Wes and Mr. Collins made up afterwards with Mr. Collins encouraging Wes to return to the Rangers and admitting that he was proud of him. He was also proud of Wes for taking his place as head of his company while he was absent, but accepts it is not Wes' role (even telling him as much). Due to the interference in the present caused by Ransik and Time Force, Bio-Lab created the Trizyrium crystals 100 years too early; the possibility of clean, infinite energy is enticing. However, Mr. Collins decides against continuing Tryzyrium crystal research after Wes explains the other Rangers' origins and the damage to the timeline the crystals could do. During the final battle with Ransik, Mr. Collins risks his life to search the city for his son, having his butler Philips transport an injured child and his mother to the hospital. He is eventually reunited with Wes and Eric and witnesses Eric being wounded. When Wes heads off to fight on his own, Mr. Collins takes Eric to the hospital. After the Rangers return to the future, Mr. Collins offers Wes command of the Silver Guardians, which he changes to protecting the city for free rather than profit. Wes agrees on the condition that Eric is his partner, which Mr. Collins is very happy with. Mr. Collins is played by late Edward Laurence Albert. =Captain Logan= Captain Logan is the head of Time Force, the Rangers' superior officer. After Ransik's escape, he angrily relieved them of their duties and refused to listen to their explanations. Despite that, he provides help to the Rangers when they are sent back in time, supplying Zords and weapons. For unknown reasons when Alex was revealed as the man in the shadows, Captain Logan refers to him as \\"sir\\" (even though Alex is clearly a subordinate in the beginning) when he informs him that Steelix has been contained. It's possible Alex's near-death experience in trying to stop Ransik got him promoted. After Alex revealed himself to the Rangers, he took Captain Logan's place as the Rangers' contact in the future. Logan is played by Roy Werner. =Philips= Philips is the Collins Family's butler and chauffeur. He gives Wes some advice once in a while. Philips is played by Douglas Fisher. =Dr. Zaskin= Dr. Michael Zaskin is a scientist who works for Collins at Bio Lab. He was once captured by Klawlox and Nadira in an attempt to learn all about the secrets of the Quantum Ranger powers. When Ransik assaulted Bio-Lab to obtain the serum for treating Venomark's poison, he witnesses Mr. Collins confronting him about Wes' destiny. Dr. Zaskin tells Wes about what he witnessed and only then Wes realized how much his father loves him. Dr. Zaskin is played by Ken Merckx. =Silver Guardians= The Silver Guardians are a private security force funded by Wes' father and later led by Eric (after becoming the Quantum Ranger) that protected Silver Hills from Ransik's mutants, but for profit. Because of such, only the wealthy could afford to be protected by the Silver Guardians. They hold a tenuous relationship with the Time Force Rangers, often running into each other when a mutant attacks. At the end of the series, Wes becomes co-leader of the Silver Guardians with Eric. At this time the Guardians are changed so they protect the city for free. In Power Rangers Wild Force, the Silver Guardians appear to be more of a Police Force than a Private Security Force, showing that the change promised by Mr. Collins was indeed genuine. =White Knight= The White Knight was the enemy of the Black Knight. The White Knight protected the Battle Fire but was defeated by the Black Knight. His spirit appeared to Wes when Wes received the Battle Fire. White Knight is voiced by Oliver Page, while his suit actor is played by Justin Neal Thompson. Antagonists The antagonists of the Power Rangers are mutant criminals that had traveled back in time with the criminal Ransik. He and the other mutants are shown to be byproducts of the future's genetic experiments, and were shunned by much of society. In the finale, certain characters were redeemed by the Time Force Power Rangers and willingly gave themselves up for judgement, returning in the following series to aid the Rangers in the crossover with Power Rangers Wild Force. =Ransik= Ransik is a mutant mastermind created by accident in 3000 and the main antagonist in the series. He possessed abilities such as energy projection, martial arts, and telekinesis. After being bitten by the mutant Venomark, he became dependent on a serum developed by Dr. Louis Ferricks; however, due to his unique DNA, Ransik would need to keep drinking the serum until the symptoms stopped recurring. He rewarded the scientist by destroying his lab and leaving him for dead. In the later episodes, Ransik no longer needs the serum. He also encountered the last surviving Orgs, who had been turned to stone. In exchange for letting them copy his mutant DNA to escape, Ransik gained greater power (such as the ability to pull weapons – swords, mostly – from his skin). While still needing the serum, his body produced weapons at random the longer he went without drinking it. Ransik's plans involve commandeering the Time Force Cryo-Prison and traveling back in time to take over with an army of mutants that committed crimes in Millennium City. He is thwarted in his first attempt by Alex, the original Red Time Force Ranger, who narrowly manages to arrest him. However, en route to the prison, Ransik is rescued by his daughter Nadira and his robotic minion Frax. They escape and accomplish Ransik's goals, and Ransik also puts Alex out of action for a long time. Alex was, in fact, thought-to-be-dead – motivating Jennifer, the Pink Time Force Ranger, to seek justice and revenge. In 2001, Ransik soon finds himself menaced by Alex's teammates and new Red Time Force Ranger Wes Collins (whom he initially mistook for Alex, due to Wes being his ancestor) upon landing in the city of Silver Hills. He uses various schemes and mutants to attack the Rangers, but never succeeds; unlike his predecessors, Ransik's schemes are cold and logical. During an early encounter with Wes, Ransik claims that he was a misunderstood outcast in the future utopia and that all mutants were oppressed. Jennifer disputes this – saying that Ransik rejected any offers of help from normal humans. Wes remains unsure regardless. Ransik temporarily takes control of the Quantasaurus Rex, but it's reclaimed by the Quantum Ranger. Shortly afterward, Frax betrays Ransik and destroys all his serum. He reveals, before escaping that he was the robotic-modified version Dr. Ferricks (who swore revenge on Ransik for the destruction of his lab and his current appearance). Unfortunately for Frax's plan, Bio-Lab has begun producing the serum they replicated from a sample Wes had found after Venomark's defeat. Ransik breaks in, steals a vial of the serum and drinks it, which permanently cures him of his ailment. While drinking it, he is noticed by Wes' father, Mr. Collins, who then admits that if he had known the true nature of the serum, he would've flushed it down the drain. Ransik fires an energy blast that puts him in a coma and escapes. Ransik eventually runs out of mutants, but captures and reprograms Frax into being his mindless slave. He unleashes a mass assault on the city with Doomtron, and destroys the Rangers' clock tower base. However, the Doomtron is destroyed by Wes. The Rangers then attempt to arrest Ransik, but he overpowers them almost effortlessly. Wes is the only one that lands a real hit on him using his Red Battle Warrior Armor. While facing Jennifer, he accidentally injures Nadira, who has changed her attitude towards humans. After talking with her briefly, and realizing how close he had come to losing what he most cared about, Ransik willingly turns himself in. He is the second villain of the Power Rangers series to not be destroyed in the end. During Power Rangers Wild Force's two-part crossover \\"Reinforcements from the Future\\", Ransik comes back to the present with the Time Force Power Rangers and Nadira to help stop the Mut-Orgs, the three Orgs he found in the future. He was possibly given a life-sentence, minus the cryogenic freeze, due to willingly surrendering to the Rangers, as he is in a cell under heavy guard when he is released to help stop the Mut-Orgs. Jennifer showed hostility when she saw Ransik again, but Cole Evans sensed that he was telling the truth and convinced her to give him a chance. Ransik, having already seen the error of his ways, shows a clear amount of guilt for the Mut-Orgs' existence. He aids the combined Time Force/Wild Force teams, and during the battle he launched a near-suicidal attack on the Mut-Orgs and destroys their mutant halves, but nearly dies in the process. He is later shown to be alive and his mutant side is purged, making him human. Thus, Ransik is one of the few Power Ranger villains to truly find redemption. Ransik is played by Vernon Wells. =Nadira= Nadira is the daughter of the criminal Ransik, who traveled back in time with her father to 2001. She is a rather obnoxious humanoid, who loves being told she is beautiful. She is similar to Trakeena from Power Rangers Lost Galaxy but is much less malevolent. Nadira would much rather run than fight, but when necessary she was a formidable opponent who possessed the ability to extend her fingernails to use as weapons. She also displayed superhuman strength, the ability to alter clothing, and to teleport. Nadira adores the 21st century fashion, frequently stealing clothing and jewelry. Nadira engineered Ransik's escape from custody, lying down on the ground and pretending to be injured. She aided her father's raid on the Cryo Prison and prevented the mutant criminal Gluto from being cryogenically frozen. Along with Ransik, Frax and Gluto, she traveled back in time to 2001. Nadira believed that the key to controlling the world in this time period was to be wealthy, and she frequently tries to accumulate more through extortion or theft. One of her schemes lead to Wes leaving his father, due to the lack of concern for a bus full of children held hostage; her plan was to hold someone of importance hostage for ransom, but the mutant she charged with the task bumbled. However, she is always defeated by the Time Force Rangers. A running gag was that Gluto had a crush on her and would try in vain to woo her, but would always be rejected. In the last episodes, as Gluto and the Cyclobots hunt down Frax, Nadira diverts herself by taking over a clothing store. Trip shows up alone to stop her, and takes on the mutant. But when a pregnant woman goes into labor, the two stop and try to help her. Trip forces Nadira to help the woman deliver her baby. Nadira emerges from the dressing room with the newborn, who she calls beautiful. Trip tells her that humans cannot be all bad, and Nadira agrees. After playing with human children, Nadira questions her supposed hatred for them. Nadira goes to an imprisoned Frax for answers. He tells her that hate is a vicious cycle propagated by humans and mutants. As Frax is taken away in chains, she apologizes for the way Ransik has treated him. In the moment, he sees a spark of goodness in Nadira and urges her to break the cycle. As Nadira tries to make Ransik stop the hate, he scolds her for mourning over Frax, and knocks her down. When a baby was left behind during the attack, she decided to keep it safe and try to find its parents. While doing that, she is accidentally wounded by Ransik and asked him to do the right thing, revealing that mutants can forgive humans. Thanks to her, her father realizes his mistakes, and willingly surrenders to the Rangers. Within a year of her return to the future, Nadira is working with children. Apparently Lucas managed to set her up so that she either did not have to go to prison, got community service, did not have a long prison sentence, or was pardoned for her crimes. She accompanied Ransik and the other Time Force Rangers in the Power Rangers Wild Force team-up episode to help them fight the Mut-Orgs. Apparently she likes Lucas as in one episode she goes out on a date with him after thinking he wrote poetry about her (it was about his race car) but in Reinforcements From the Future at the end he walks off with her holding hands indicating that he may possibly return her feelings. Nadira is played by Kate Sheldon. =Frax= Frax is a robot in the service of Ransik, responsible for constructing the army of robot minions that Ransik sends against the Time Force Rangers. A robot himself, he dislikes Ransik's belief that robots are inferior, as well as the mutant's habits of destroying his creations when he is angry. This rage goes unnoticed by Ransik for much of the series until Frax's Fury, when Frax finally takes his anger out on him. Frax's arsenal consists of a claw arm that transforms into a hand-like missile launcher. It is later revealed that Frax is actually all that is left of Dr. Louis Ferricks (portrayed by Jeff Griggs), the scientist from the future who attempted to heal Ransik of his poisoning by Venomark, a mutant criminal who is later captured and placed in the X-Vault. He also provides the serum that Ransik must consume regularly to combat the poison, expecting nothing in return. Dr. Ferricks was a truly compassionate human, not caring about who or what he helped. Ransik destroys his lab, steals the serum supplies, and leaves him for dead. Dr. Fericks only survives by rebuilding himself into a robot, and resents Ransik for his actions. Later in the series, Frax ends up discovering the key to the X-Vault (where the worst prisoners are contained) after being admonished for sending his robotic creation Tronicon to destroy the Rangers. He releases many of them without Ransik's approval, including Venomark (an action that angers Ransik due to their past history). As a form of revenge, he destroys all of his serum, reveals his true identity to Ransik, and runs away from Ransik and the Cyclobots on Ransik's side. However, Wes found the sample of the serum that Ransik left behind and Bio Lab began producing the serum to treat the citizens infected by Venomark. Despite this, he begins constructing massive robots that run on powerful Trizirium crystals from Mr. Collins' lab. In the series finale, Frax is captured by Ransik with the aid of Gluto (who finds Frax's hideout) while working on his giant robot Doomtron. Nadira, comes to him after she begins to doubt her father's mission. Frax explains that the hatred and prejudice between humans and mutants is a vicious cycle and he urges her to break it before being taken away and having his memory erased. He is then reprogrammed to obey Ransik without a question (which makes him much more evil than before) and to use his robot Doomtron to wreak havoc in the city. Wes is able to return and destroy Doomtron, causing Frax to shut down as a result. Frax is voiced by Eddie Frierson. =Gluto= Gluto is a minor, mafioso-themed, mutant criminal who joins the service of Ransik when he is saved from stasis by the arrival of the villain's forces. He appears to be a blue whale-like mutant. He aids Ransik in the 21st century, serving as the dumb muscle of the mutant army. A running gag is his crush on Ransik's daughter, Nadira, and his attempts to win her affection; he would always be promptly rejected. Gluto later finds the hideout of Frax and brings in Ransik to collect him. During the final assault on the city, Gluto decides to freeze himself inside the prison where he was unwilling to stick around for whatever might happen. His name is most likely derived from glutton or gluttony, considering his obesity. Gluto had the ability to use his flatulence to propel himself into the air. Gluto is also known to be a coward at times. Gluto is voiced by Neil Kaplan. =Black Knight= An evil Black Knight who appeared in \\"Beware the Knight\\". It is the only non-mutant, robot or demon the Time Force Rangers face, possibly being a ghost. He went after a legendary power source known as the Battle Fire, but was stopped by the knight it belonged to; he sought any brave warriors with pure hearts through the ages to open the box housing the power. A dragon guards the box for him. The Knight appeared to have gotten desperate by the 21st century, since he targeted anyone claiming that they would protect others. Wes got to the Battle Fire first, and received the Red Battle Warrior Armor, which he used to destroy the Black Knight. The Black Knight is voiced by Dave Mallow and his suit actor is played by Kelly Bailey. =Quarganon= Quarganon is a Super Demon who was imprisoned within an artifact known as the Solar Amulet. When Vypra comes back to life, she attempts to steal the Amulet. However, because she is a ghost, she cannot take it from inside its case (Vypra has energy projection abilities; it is not explained why she did not simply use those to break open the case). She forms an alliance with Ransik and succeeds in stealing it, then summons the powerful Super Demon during the sun's alignment with the stars through this incantation: From the deepest shadows far below, where no mortal will dare to go. Only Demons toss and burn. Now mighty Quarganon, it's your time to return!. However, the Lightspeed Rangers arrive to help the Time Force Rangers. Carter Grayson (Red Lightspeed Ranger) destroys him with his Trans- Armor Cycle and Vypra by Wesley Collins (Red Time Force Ranger) with his Red Battle Warrior. Quarganon is voiced by Ron Roggé. =Cyclobots= The Cyclobots are Ransik's robotic foot soldiers that were originally invented by Dr. Ferricks. He intended them as friends and aides, but Ransik stole the schematics when he betrayed the doctor. They are fairly strong and attack in massive hordes, but the Rangers have little trouble defeating them. They can be deployed from small golden bolts or disguise themselves as humans to ambush their foes. They are unable to speak when in their true form. They usually wield short swords that double as energy blasters and it has parts that are similar to Darth Maul's Lightsaber, but have occasionally carried more powerful bazookas for widespread destruction. =Mutants= These are mutant criminals that have been captured by Time Force and cryogenically frozen in the Cryo-Prison as shrunken figures after committing crimes in Millennium City. When Ransik hijacked it, he had an army of mutants at his disposal. Every Mutant has a DNA patch on their bodies that causes them to grow to a massive size if removed. They revert to their shrunken state when defeated in normal or giant forms, after which one of the Rangers places them in a studded container with a window on the front that displays the imprisoned mutant. The containers are stored in a fridge-like unit in the Rangers' base, ready for transport back to the future. * Flamecon - He first appeared in the first episode where he was frozen. Later, he attacked Silver Hills in the sixth episode. He was frozen by The Time Force Megazord Mode Red. * Jetara (voiced by Derek Stephen Prince) - A ladybug-themed mutant who is first criminal to be released from the Cyro-prison. He starts wreaking havoc on the relatively primitive police force of Silver Hills. He was frozen by the Time Force Megazord Mode Red. * Fearog (voiced by David Stenstrom) - A gecko-themed mutant sent by Ransik to attack Wes. He was frozen by the Time Force Megazord Mode Red. * Samurhive - A Samurai/Bee Stinger-themed mutant who appears in one of Ransik's flashbacks. * Eyacon - A three-eyed mutant who appears in one of Ransik's flashbacks. * Mantamobile (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz) - A light blue water flea-themed mutant. He is a master car thief, specializing in hijacking and upgrading vehicles with his tentacles. He was frozen by the Time Force Megazord Mode Red. * Tentaclaw (voiced by Ezra Weisz) - A mutant whose head and body can act independent of each other. His octopus-like head can levitate and produce numerous tentacles for combat, while his lobster-like body has great strength and the ability to fire lasers from its claws. He was known for kidnapping the Mayor of Millennium City in the year 3000. It's his history that caused Nadira to revive him in another bid to get rich in the present by kidnapping the kids from the park and holding them for ransom. He was frozen by the Vortex Blaster while his body is frozen by the Time Force Megazord Mode Blue. * Rabbitcon - A mutant released by Ransik in the seventh episode to attack the city. He attacked Silver Hills with army of Cyclobots and encountered the Rangers. Trip offered it to surrender without battle, but the mutant refused and the battle started. He nearly defeated Trip with his tentacles, but he defeated it with Time Strike of his sword. He was nearly defeated, but he removed his DNA patch and enlarged himself. In the giant battle, he tried to battle the Ranger's Zords with his powerful laser eye, but was defeated by Time Flyers. He was defeated and frozen by Time Force Megazord. * Medicon (voiced by Dan Woren) - A white-colored robotic medical mutant whom Frax dismissed as \\"nothing but a quack\\". When Nadira kidnapped Circuit, it severely damaged Circuit, preventing him from calling on the Time Fliers. He then fought the Rangers and took advantage of the Time Force Megazord's absence to attack Silver Hills as a giant. However Trip rescued and repaired Circuit, allowing him to call the Time Force Megazord and defeat the mutant. * Fatcatfish (voiced by Tom Wyner) - A cowardly catfish-themed bounty hunter that once fought Alex and Jennifer. Ransik unfroze him so he could place a bounty on the Rangers. However, he ended up spending the first half of his payment on buying gifts for Nadira, who tried to seduce him for his money. When it fought the Rangers, he taunted Jennifer over Alex's death, driving her to nearly destroy him rather than arrest him like the other mutants and it was only by Wes talking her down and asking her what Alex would do that prevented her from finishing him off. He also was disrespectful towards robots, using the Cyclobots as target practice, this led Frax to get revenge by setting up both Fatcatfish and Ransik to be busted by Time Force. He was frozen by the Time Force Megazord Mode Red. * Izout (voiced by David Lodge) - A cyborg hammerhead shark monster. Heavily armed with guns and grenades, he helps Frax into breaking into Bio-Lab to steal the Zirium Powder. After crippling the Time Force Megazord, he was frozen by the Time Jet. * Redeye (voiced by Wendee Lee) - A red-eyed female swallow-themed mutant who attacked Silver Hills. A clone of her appeared in Miracle's mirror world but was destroyed by the Rangers. * Electropede (voiced by Steve Kramer) - An energy-draining caterpillar-themed mutant that Ransik used to drain the city's power and could absorb the energy from the Rangers' weapons and was going to release all the energy he absorbed to destroy the city. However Trip's invention, the Electro- Booster, overloaded his energy, causing him to expel it harmlessly and reducing him to a husk. Frax made it grow by shooting off his DNA patch, but the mutant was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Blue. * Brickneck (voiced by Michael Sorich) - A brick-necked soldier mutant sent by Ransik to raid a dig site to steal the Quantum Controller. He was frozen by the Quantum Ranger. * Commandocon (voiced by Dave Mallow) - A metallic commando-themed mutant with a hunting-motif who can generate time portals. He was sent to the distant past in order to retrieve the Quantasaurus Rex. He was frozen by the Q-Rex Megazord Mode. * Klawlox (voiced by Tony Oliver) - A yellow hammerhead shark-themed mutant with a lobster claw for a right hand who captured Dr. Michael Zaskin in an attempt to learn all the secrets of the Quantum Ranger powers. He was frozen by the Q-Rex and Shadow Force Megazord Mode Red. * Cruel Senturicon - A traffic police-themed mutant In the seventeenth episode, he was released by Ransik. He attacked Silver Hills with an army of Cyclobots and fought the Rangers. He used his anchor arms in battle. The Rangers quickly defeated all the Cyclobots and then fought the mutant, who the removed his DNA patch and enlarged himself. The Rangers formed the Time Force Megazord Mode Blue and started the battle. In his giant form, he was more powerful and used his ability to become invisible and attacked the Megazord from different sides, using his super speed and his mace. Despite all of this, the Rangers used Mode Red and defeated him. * Turtlecon (voiced by Steve McGowan) - A turtle-themed mutant with the power to send people into pocket dimensions. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Blue. * Notacon (voiced by Barbara Goodson) - A powerful but good-hearted jellyfish/squid-themed mutant with tentacle arms. His bizarre appearance caused people to fear and shun him which forced him to steal to survive, with his petty theft of vegetables getting him busted by Time Force. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Red. He is the only mutant who willingly allows himself to be captured. * Conwing (voiced by Sean Cw Johnson) - An odd squid-themed mutant able to disguise himself as a human (portrayed by Don Dowe). He used a device to match Eric's voice and take control of the Quantasaurus Rex. He was frozen by the Quantum Ranger's Megabattle Mode. * Dash (voiced by Riley Schmidt) - A race car driver mutant with incredible-albeit reckless driving skills. Like several other mutants, he can adopt a human form (also played by Riley Schmidt), although his bizarre taste in food (banana with ketchup) can give him away. He and Lucas were friendly racing rivals until it injured innocent bystanders with his driving. Lucas testified against him, leading to its incarceration in the Cryo-Prison. He was frozen by the Time Force Megazord Mode Red. * Contemptra (voiced by Valerie Vernon) - A female Gorgon-themed mutant with the ability to brainwash others using her snake bracelet. She appeared in the form of an attractive female human named Angelique (portrayed by Rachelle Pettinato) to seed discord into Wes, Trip, and Lucas (although Wes was initially able to resist her influence due to his attraction to Jennifer). Jennifer and Katie were able to break the others free from her control by destroying her snake bracelet. She was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Red. * Ironspike (voiced by Richard Cansino) - A really strong Oni-themed mutant with spikes on his head and shoulder pads that wielded a sword. He was also one of the mutants that the Rangers encountered again in Miracon's mirror world. * Artillicon (voiced by Bob Papenbrook) - A mechanical-looking mutant with powerful weapons. He can turn into a jet for quick escapes. He was frozen by the Time Force Megazord Mode Red. * Cinecon (voiced by Terrence Stone) - A film director-themed mutant. He posed as a film director (portrayed by Harvey Shain) to lure the Rangers into a trap that involved a Power Rangers movie that turned out to be titled \\"The End of the Power Rangers\\". His clapperboard can transfer people into movie-like settings and he can warp reality by writing events into a binder. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Blue after his originally scripted victory was interrupted by Trip taking out the last page earlier to get an autograph. * Steelix (voiced by J.W. Myers) - Steelix was Jennifer's original partner in Time Force, but he was secretly a mole who was selling top-secret information to Ransik. When Jennifer found out, she brought him in. He was sentenced to cryo-freeze. When Ransik releases him after returning to the past, the mutant decides to exact revenge on Jennifer. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Blue. * Severax (voiced by Paul Schrier) - A mechanical ax-themed mutant. After Frax destroys Ransik's serum supply and flees, Ransik releases him to take part in a raid on Bio-Lab to steal the serums there. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Red. * Chef Bug - A bug/pig-themed mutant with a cook. He was mentioned by Ransik in his discussion to Nadira. * Mister Mechanau (voiced by Mike Reynolds) - A dark wizard-themed mutant with a sword and telekinetic powers. After Frax restored him, he posed as a human salesman (portrayed by C.J. Byrnes) to get customers to buy a fitness drink that made them act like Cyclobots, giving Frax a new army. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Blue. * Miracon (voiced by Philip Proctor) - A big-brained mutant that can travel through mirrors. He captured the Rangers through mirrors and pulled them into another dimension within the mirrors where he pitted them against mutants they had already arrested. It also briefly turned the Shadow Force Megazord against the other Rangers before he was finally defeated. * Angelcon (voiced by Kirk Thornton) - A white angel-themed mutant who appeared in one of the mirrors of the Mirror World that was destroyed by the Yellow Ranger. * Chameliacon (voiced by Kerrigan Mahan) - A chameleon-themed mutant with powerful tongue attacks. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Blue. * Serpicon (voiced by Mark A. Richardson) - A giant girdled lizard-themed mutant. He attacked a local space center in Silver Hills in order to set it to self-destruct. He was frozen by the Q-Rex Megazord Mode. X-Vault Mutants Several of the most dangerous mutants are placed in a separate location called the X-Vault. They serve Frax, as he is the only one with the key to the vault. Ransik and the others were unaware of the vault until the finale which Nadira noted that the X-Vault is empty. * Vexicon (voiced by Richard Epcar) - A top-themed mutant. When Frax accidentally stumbled upon the key to the X-Vault, he was the first mutant he released from the infamous storage area. He was extremely hard to take down, managing to defeat the Rangers with ease in their first meeting. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Blue. * Univolt (voiced by Bob Papenbrook) - An electrical mutant that was imprisoned in the Cryo-Prison's X-Vault until he was released by Frax. He was also responsible for exposing Wes' identity in front of his father and Eric. He was frozen by the Vortex Blaster. * Venomark (voiced by Kim Strauss) - A twisted Scream-inspired mutant that was imprisoned in the Cryo-Prison's X-Vault until he was released by Frax. He has super speed and the ability to conjure a sword from thin air, but his main weapon is his bite, which inflicts an extremely painful and lethal disease on anyone he can sink his fangs into. One of his victims was Ransik, causing the latter to develop a massive grudge against him. The only known cure for his bite is a serum invented by Dr. Louis Ferricks. He was frozen by the Shadow Force Megazord Mode Red and the Q-Rex Megazord Mode. =Frax's Robots= These robots are creations of Frax, mostly after his betrayal of Ransik. They are functionally similar to the regular mutant enemies (including the DNA patch that allows them to grow), but are completely silent and are actually destroyed in battle, rather than being imprisoned. They are usually powered by Trizirium Crystals. * Tronicon (voiced by Kim Strauss) - Frax's first robot was designed to prove that robots are just as effective as mutants against the Power Rangers. Physically, it resembled a heavily armed Cyclobot with extra armor on its torso. It attacked with lasers from its cannon arm, rockets from a launcher above said cannon, and rebounding energy discs from its shoulders. This robotic monster was destroyed by the Time Shadow Megazord in its first battle. * Dragontron - A giant dragon-like robot that was created by Frax following his breaking away from Ransik. It was extremely strong and durable, with impressive regeneration abilities to boot. Its only weakness was an exposed core on its back, but Frax could usually cover this weakness when directly overseeing his creation. When Wes rejoins the Rangers, they use the Time Force Megazord to destroy it while they are riding on the Q-Rex. * Max Axe - A robot created by Frax to wreak havoc on the city while he was completing his ultimate weapon. It was heavily armed, with large cannons on its shoulders, a Gatling gun for a left hand, and an ax blade on its right hand. Eric uses the Quantum Defender while on the Q-Rex to destroy it. * Doomtron - The final robot created by Frax is this massive crab-clawed machine which seemingly bears its maker's image on its face. Unlike the previous robots, it required a pilot to function as Frax himself only pilots it after Ransik captures and reprograms him into a mindlessly loyal slave. When Wes regains control of the Q-Rex, he uses the Quantum Defender to destroy the robot.

The GP2/11 is the overall third generation of car used by the GP2 Series and first generation of car used by the FIA Formula 2 Championship, and was introduced at the Yas Marina round of the 2011 season, replacing the Dallara GP2/08, which was also developed by Dallara. The GP2/11 was scheduled to be used until the end of the 2013 season, in keeping with the series' philosophy of upgrading its chassis every three years, but series organisers decided to keep it in competition for another three-year cycle in a bid to cut costs in the category. The GP2/11 was scheduled to be used until the end of the 2016 season before a next-generation car was introduced in 2017, but this was delayed again until 2018. As the GP2 Series and Formula 2 Championship are spec series, the GP2/11 was raced by every team and driver on the grid. History Dallara began development, design and construction of the GP2/11 chassis in late 2009. The first chassis was assembled in July 2010, with the first chassis completed on 9 September 2010. The Dallara GP2/11 chassis replaced the Dallara GP2/08 chassis in the 2011 season. The engine still remained the same 4.0 litre (244 cu in) naturally-aspirated V8 engine developed by Mecachrome but the exhaust systems were altered by merging two exits together. The chassis was used throughout the rest of the GP2 Series from 2011-2016, and for the inaugural revived 2017 FIA Formula 2 Championship. This chassis was generally not well received as previous chassis packages due to its appearance and the fact that overtaking was much harder compared to previous cars. To combat this, DRS was introduced in the 2015 season. Another criticism of this car was that they favoured drivers who had experience at GP2/F2 level for multiple years. As a result of this, only once since the GP2/11 was introduced has a rookie won the GP2 / Formula 2 Drivers' Championship. After the 2017 Abu Dhabi rounds and Abu Dhabi post-season testing of the FIA Formula 2 Championship, the chassis together with engines were permanently retired from competition and replaced with the Dallara F2 2018 chassis starting from the 2018 season.

It contained a collection of 88 carved human figures, four carved whale figures, and sixteen human skulls. Since the early twentieth century, it has been in the possession of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, but is rarely displayed. Talks are underway regarding repatriation. Description The Shrine was first described in first-hand accounts in 1785 by early Western explorers as a Nootka (Nuu-chah-nulth) ceremonial site; the actual origin of the Shrine is unclear. Anthropologist Aldona Jonaitis believes a text of Camille de Roquefeuil written in 1818 provides the first conclusive evidence of the Shrine's existence from the perspective of multiple people. Rituals performed at the Shrine are of some contention, with more recent texts from anthropologists Franz Boas and Philip Drucker describing the ritual as involving the use of skulls or corpses that do not appear in the earlier French texts of de Roquefeuil and his ship's surgeon Yves-Thomas Vimont. What is known is that it was of considerable importance given the Nuu-chah-nulth's long history of whaling, going back at least 4000 years. Removal It has been suggested that it was late in the winter canning season of 1900/early 1901 that George Hunt, a Tlingit-English ethnographer, learned of this 'mysterious' Shrine in the forest near Yuquot. Hunt initiated communications with Franz Boas in 1903 about the existence of the Shrine, photographing it meticulously to gauge his interest; Boas was excited to purchase it on behalf of his employer, the American Museum of Natural History. Two elders claimed they had power to give permission to remove the Shrine and Hunt negotiated a price with both of them, with the condition was he was to wait until the band left for the hunt before removing the Shrine, as they feared a backlash. It was in 1904 that the Shrine was moved to the AMNH where is remains today, yet to be fully displayed.  Franz Boas, George Hunt, and Salvage Anthropology  Photo of George Hunt taken by Edward Curtis c.1910. \\"Hamatsa Initiate in his Hut - Kwakiutl\\" George Hunt, upon removal of the Shrine, wrote to Boas to tell him, \\"It was the best thing I ever bought from the Indians\\". For Boas, the acquisition of the Whalers' Shrine became a defining 'historical moment', and marked a new direction in his 'new found obsession' with regard to the museum, its collections, and displays. Anthropologist Harry Whitehead has been especially outspoken about the methods used by George Hunt and Franz Boas in acquiring artefacts (and specifically the Whalers' Shrine). He believes that they contributed significantly to the perpetuation of salvage anthropology through their frequent collection and cataloguing of First Nations or American Indian objects. Whitehead says that in an attempt to save artefacts of the Nuu-chah-nulth before they 'disappeared', they accelerated the destruction of their 'traditional culture'. Furthermore, their public display and photographs of the artefacts collected prompted others to follow suit in collecting for their own institutions, which exacerbated the situation and led to years of misrepresentation of many groups of people and artefacts taken under false pretences. Aaron Glass, anthropologist of the Northwest Coast, has said that Hunt and Boas directly influenced photographers and anthropologists looking to capture Nuu-chah-nulth culture before it 'disappeared', continuing the practice of salvage ethnography and anthropology. He writes that famous photographer Edward Curtis (spurred on by Hunt's photographs to make his own of the Nuu-chah-nulth) was interventionist in his work and added things for visual effect and interest, encouraging the romanticizing of a 'lost culture' typical of salvage ethnography. George Hunt himself, under disguise, posed as a member of the Nuu-chah-nulth to demonstrate his interpretation of certain ceremonies in 1910 for Curtis' camera. The photograph is not of George Hunt falsely acting out a Nuu-chah-nulth initiation at all, George is acting out a Kwakiutl ceremony on the East coast of Vancouver Island which he was familiar with.  Repatriation  The repatriation of the Shrine and its contents are mired by extenuating and complicating circumstances. Canada does not presently have legislation in governing repatriation; however, museums act as caretakers on a case-by-case basis. In the United States, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) requires Native American cultural items to be returned to 'lineal descendents'. The current discourse of the Shrine is to build a community centre that would house the Shrine, or build a replica of the Shrine. Jonaitas explains, however, that there needs to be a more 'nuanced' view and understanding of how historical events occurring, both before and after the acquisition, has presented challenges as to how to repatriate in light of loss of ceremonial rituals and traditions surrounding the handling of such sacred items. The repatriation of the Whalers' Shrine was the subject of a 1994 documentary entitled 'Washing of Tears' by filmmaker and anthropologist, Hugh Brody.  Heritage Value  Canada has designated the Whalers' Shrine Site as a national historic site since 1983.

Wild Force Power Rangers The Wild Force Rangers are granted mystical powers and charged to protect the Earth from pollution-created creatures called Orgs. More specifically, they defend the fictional city of Turtle Cove, and are stationed aboard a flying island called the Animarium. Their mentor is Princess Shayla, and her mentor is Animus (an ancient Megazord). The Rangers represent the Ancient Animarium Warriors who also fought to destroy the Orgs and saved the Earth. The Rangers morph using devices known as Growl Phones. Each Ranger is also armed with a Crystal Saber (into which an Animal Crystal is inserted to call a Wild Zord). In addition to piloting their Wild Zords, the Rangers pilot other vehicles, like the Soul Bird and the Savage Cycles. When the Rangers put their weapons together they create the Jungle Sword, which can be used by the Red Ranger to defeat certain enemies. The Rangers have displayed claws on their gloves while morphed. The Yellow Ranger, additionally, has wing-like flaps under her arms, giving her the ability to fly and glide on currents of wind. =Cole Evans= Cole Evans is the main protagonist and the Red Lion Ranger. He is the son of scientists Richard and Elizabeth Evans, who were killed by Master Org 20 years prior. Cole, a baby at the time, was found and raised by a jungle tribe of natives. This life gave him an incredible connection to nature which greatly prepared him to be a Ranger. He has amazing agility, sharp senses, and thinks on his feet. When the natives felt Cole was old enough, they gave him a few items they found on him as a baby - a picture of his parents, and the Red Lion animal crystal and sent him on a quest to find his destiny. With only these two things to go on, Cole left the wilderness for the city of Turtle Cove. Shortly after, he was found by Princess Shayla and the Rangers, and chosen by the Red Lion to be the Red Wild Force Ranger. Cole has a love for animals and the wilderness. He immediately fell in love with his new home on the Animarium. His connection with nature allows him to communicate with animals, including the Wild Zords. Cole is the only Ranger who can understand the Wild Zords when they speak to the Rangers telepathically. He once tried to appeal to the heart of an Org, only to find with his senses that the Org had none. Cole is a bit inexperienced in the ways of the civilized man, but approaches each new challenge with zeal, such as learning to ride his Savage Cycle. Cole, despite being the rookie of the team, was appointed its leader, just as the lion is the king of the jungle. Cole believes that there is good in all living creatures, despite the lack of hearts in Orgs. Cole even forgave the late Viktor Adler for the murder of his parents, placing flowers on Adler's grave. After the Wild Force was disbanded, Cole used his talents to help animals. The original script to \\"The End Of The Power Rangers\\" mentions that he would become a veterinarian. This scene was filmed, but it was ultimately cut and is not seen in the version of the episode that was aired. In \\"Reinforcements from the Future\\", Cole was the only one who believed Ransik was remorseful for his part in creating the MutOrgs. Following the defeat of the Orgs he would give up his powers along with his teammates, but they would later reclaim them in order to battle the Warstar Armada alongside the Megaforce Rangers, who also fought with the aid of Cole's Red Lion Zord. As the Red Ranger, Cole fights with the ferocity of the Blazing Lion. He is also equipped with the Red Lion Fang, Lion Blaster, Falcon Summoner, the Falconator, and the Animarium Armor. His Power Animals are the Red Lion, the Green Gorilla, and the Ruby Falcon Wildzords. He would later join his teammates in the final battle with the Armada forces in Super Megaforce. Cole is played by Ricardo Medina, Jr. (who would later portray Deker in Power Rangers Samurai). =Taylor Earhardt= Taylor Earhardt is the Yellow Eagle Ranger and second-in-command of the team. As a young girl, Taylor looked out an airplane window and saw the Animarium. She later landed on it while serving in the Air Force, and found Princess Shayla then became the leader of the group until Cole joined. Taylor was the first Wild Force Ranger to be recruited and had served as a Ranger for over a year prior to being replaced as leader by Cole Evans, the Red Ranger and rookie of the team, much to her dismay. Taylor's military past has made her rather regimental, tomboyish and insensitive, leading her to write a rule book for the team. The jealousy she felt towards Cole deepened when he disregarded it. When she teamed up with the Time Force Rangers to defeat the Mut-Orgs, Taylor quickly developed a love relationship with Eric Myers, the Quantum Ranger, because since he pulled her over and gave her a speeding ticket, though they eventually gained something of a mutual respect. Eric even lent her the Quantum Defender in battle. After the final battle with Master Org, Taylor gave up her Ranger powers and returned to the Air Force, where she was looked up to as a legend by the younger members. She frequently meets the Yellow Eagle Zord in the sky. She would later return for the final battle in Super Megaforce. As the Yellow Ranger, she has the grace of the Soaring Eagle. She is also equipped with the Golden Eagle Sword, Soaring Darts, and Armadillo Puck. Her Wild Zords are the Soaring Eagle, and Bear Brothers Zords (a Black Bear and a Polar Bear). Taylor is played by Alyson Kiperman. =Max Cooper= Max Cooper is the Blue Shark Ranger, and was the third Wild Force Ranger to be recruited and both he and Alyssa were Rangers for roughly six months prior to Cole joining the team. Max became a Power Ranger when he aided two girls in escaping from Turbine Org. After Taylor and Alyssa successfully chased off the Org, the Blue Shark animal crystal materialized in Max's pocket and he became the Blue Wild Force Power Ranger. He is best friends with Danny Delgado, the Black Ranger. Max was originally training to be a pro-bowler when he became a Power Ranger. When he quit, he lost the respect of his teacher. Max later returned to learn his mentor's ultimate bowling technique called the Tornado Spin for use against Bowling Org. After much convincing, his teacher taught him the move. Max is considered the \\"kid\\" of the group, which he resents, but it's because of his youth and childlike behavior. He constantly tries to prove himself, leading to cockiness and aggressiveness on his part. He brings a sense of humor to the Rangers, and is a master of improvisation. He usually calls the Blue Shark \\"Sharky\\", implying that they share a very strong bond. After surrendering their powers, Max and Danny left Turtle Cove together and went on a long vacation around the world, something they like to call the \\"Never Give Up\\" tour. They later returned to battle alongside their teammates and other veteran Rangers in Super Megaforce. As the Blue Ranger, he commands the Blue Shark Wild Zord, Polar Bear Zord (shared with Taylor), and the Orange Giraffe Zord. He is also equipped with the Blue Shark Fighting Fins and the Sword of Pardolis. Max is played by Phillip Jeanmarie. =Danny Delgado= Daniel \\"Danny\\" Delgado is the Black Bison Ranger. His motto is \\"Never give up\\" which is mentioned several times during the season. Most times, Max Cooper, the Blue Ranger, would have to remind him what that motto is whenever he feels like giving up. He works at a flower shop, where he is very passionate about the flowers. He has a fear of heights which is shown when trying to retrieve the Giraffe Zord crystal after he knocked it out of Toxica's hand. Danny was the fourth Ranger to be recruited and had served as a Ranger for two months prior to Cole joining the team. Danny is the strongest Wild Force Ranger physically, but deep inside is a peaceful man, with a sweet side and some childish quirks (like sleeping with a Teddy Bear). He is in love with a girl named Kendall, who works in the same flower shop as he, but he is too shy to tell her, and gets (even more) clumsy when she is nearby. Eventually, she found out that he was the Black Ranger, but decided that he needed to focus on his mission, and turned him down. When the Rangers disbanded, he and Max embarked on a global vacation, visiting different cities around the world. According to an earlier script, Kendall was supposed to join them. Danny also appeared as part of the Ranger army in Super Megaforce. While Cole was originally thought of as the only Wild Force Ranger who could understand the Wild Zords (a trait which Merrick also probably shared), Danny has been shown on more than one occasion to be able to understand the Bison Zord. Whether he can talk to anyone else's Zords remains unknown. Besides the Bison Zord, Danny also commands the Rhinoceros Zord and the Armadillo Zord. He is also equipped with the Black Bison Axe and the Rhino Shooter. Danny is played by Jack Guzman. =Alyssa Enrilé= Alyssa Enrilé is the White Tiger Ranger. She was the second Ranger to join the team (after Taylor and before Max, Danny and Cole).She is the kind, nurturing member of the group. When any Ranger is injured, she is right there tending to their wounds. Alyssa tries to defuse any tension between team members. Being a kind-hearted, sensitive girl, Alyssa often was in the position of peacekeeper. In the early days of the team, Alyssa tried to keep peace between Cole and Taylor who would have conflicting ideas on what was best for the team. She would cook for the team and even read stories to Danny and Max. There have been a few hints that Alyssa may have a crush on Cole. When Alyssa wasn't fighting Orgs, she stayed active by riding her bike to school and taking dance classes at Turtle Cove University. Alyssa was trained in the martial arts by her father, who is a renowned martial arts instructor. He intended for her to eventually take over running his school, and was heartbroken when Alyssa decided to move to Turtle Cove and attend Turtle Cove University. One day when he visited his daughter, he was proud to discover that not only was she a Ranger, but she had excelled in the martial arts he taught her. As a result, he accepted her decision to continue her education. When the Orgs were defeated, Alyssa was relieved of her life as a Ranger. She finished college and became a kindergarten teacher. In the last episode, she is seen telling her story to her class in a fairy tale fashion, making her the narrator of the finale. As the White Wild Force Ranger, Alyssa fights with the guile and agility of the Noble Tiger. She is also equipped with the White Tiger Baton and the Deer Clutcher. Her Power Animals are the White Tiger, the Cyan Elephant, the Black Bear (shared with Taylor), and the Jade Deer Wildzords. Alyssa is played by Jessica Rey. =Merrick Baliton= Merrick Baliton is the Lunar Wolf Ranger, the sixth Ranger of the series. He was once one of the original six warriors of Animaria. He witnessed the battle between the ancient, evil Master Org and Animus. When Animus fell, Merrick took it upon himself to defeat Master Org. Knowing that he did not have enough power to defeat Master Org alone, he donned a cursed wolf mask which gave him the power of the Duke Org Zen-Aku. With this power, he was able to defeat Master Org. However, he was soon corrupted by the mask's power and Zen-Aku took control of his body. Merrick pleaded with his comrades to kill him before the mask took complete control. But rather than kill Merrick, they sealed him into a stone-coffin in order to protect the world from Zen-Aku's power. Centuries later, he was released by Nayzor to destroy the Wild Force Rangers. As Zen-Aku, he battled them on several occasions, but he was not all evil. When Alyssa was injured by Jindrax and Toxica, he bandaged her wound while she was unconscious. The fighting went on until the Rangers learned the truth and helped free him from the curse, with help from the Rhino and Armadillo Wild Zords. Princess Shayla had figured out the curse's power was tied to his Zords and had the Rangers destroy his Zords as the Predazord, breaking the curse. Merrick became the Lunar Wolf Ranger and comes to the others aid when needed. Unfortunately, breaking the curse also freed Zen-Aku and he returned to do battle with the Rangers. Merrick had to face his apparently unbeatable dark side, but using a new pool trick he learned from his friend and boss Willie, Merrick weakened Zen-Aku and destroyed him with the help of the Armadillo Zord. Its later revealed that Zen-Aku somehow survived, but he seeks redemption now like Merrick. It is suggested throughout the series that Merrick has long been romantically involved with Princess Shayla, although presumably the guilt he had being under the curse of Zen-Aku, along with his self-imposed exile, prevented them from expressing it for a long while. Unlike Rangers turned from evil to good in previous series of Power Rangers, Merrick did not immediately join the Wild Force Rangers. He is notable for remaining something of an antihero because of his largely self-imposed exile from Animaria. He, however, befriends a roadside bar operator named Willie, who he convinces to stay as an employee after defending his establishment from thugs. It is hinted that Willie is aware of his identity as a Power Ranger due to his mysterious disappearances. He is an avid player of pool, although he only plays to repeatedly practice one trick shot (the same one used in his Lunar Cue finishing move, which also served to summon his Wild Zords). In the finale, it is revealed that Merrick has made his peace with the now remorseful Zen-Aku, and that they are traveling the world together both seeking redemption for their actions. His Silver Wolf, Violet Hammerhead Shark, and Emerald Alligator Wild Zords combine to form the Predazord. He is also equipped with the Lunar Cue. Merrick is played by Philip Andrew. Allies of the Power Rangers=Princess Shayla= Princess Shayla is the Princess of the Animarium, a floating landmass that is the last remnant of the lost world of Animaria. After the demise of Animus and Master Org, she fell asleep for centuries. However, she was reawakened along with the Org spirits by the pollution caused by humans. Shayla serves as the adviser to the Rangers, as well as filling the role of damsel in distress. However, she can and will defend herself if absolutely necessary. She has a romantic relationship with her former protector, Merrick Baliton, but he refuses to let his feelings get in the way of his duty. Previously before the occurrence of the chaos in her kingdom, Merrick had given to the Princess a necklace, and when kidnapped by Zen-Aku, she tells him that someone very special to her (Merrick) gave it to her a long ago and she wears it in his memory. In \\"Fishing for a Friend\\", Master Org grabs the necklace, as it was a magical necklace that has great power. Master Org uses the necklace to protect the Nexus, revive fallen Org generals and also used it in the final ceremony to revive the Org Heart. After Master Org was destroyed, Shayla took back the Wild Force Powers and went back into the sky, until the Wild Zords are needed to protect the earth once more. She was not seen in Super Megaforce, despite the fact that the Super Megaforce Rangers visit Animarium and find the active Red Lion. Princess Shayla is played by Ann Marie Crouch. =Kendall= Kendall works at a flower shop where Danny used to work before he was chosen to become a Ranger. Danny had a crush on her, but after she learns of his identity as a Power Ranger when Wedding Dress Org attacked. After the Org's defeat, both Kendall and Danny agreed that any chance of them being romantically involved would never be. Kendall is played by Sandra McCoy. =Willie= Willie is an owner at a road house. After unruly thugs were ejected by Merrick, he allows him to stay with him. He once in a while plays a game of pool with Merrick. It is thanks to a pool trick Willie taught Merrick that the Rangers were able to defeat Zen-Aku when he appeared separate from Merrick and stronger than ever. Willie is played by J. D. Hall. =Animus= Animus is a deity-like Megazord who was said by Princess Shayla to be the direct ancestor of the Rangers' Wild Force Megazord. Animus is composed of the Black Lion, the Buffalo, the Condor, the Sawshark, and the Leopard Wild Zords. 3,000 years ago, he battled against the original Master Org and was destroyed, but his spirit lingers on. In the modern day while the Rangers were fighting Zen-Aku, he appeared to Zen-Aku and urged him to \\"remember\\". He later helps the Rangers again, he does this by eclipsing the full moon that was powering Zen-Aku's curse that temporary restored him to Merrick. Animus' spirit later instructed Princess Shayla to help Merrick get the Deer Zord to help the Rangers fight Tombstone Org. After Tombstone Org's destruction, Animus' spirit appears in the sky as the Rangers thank him. Animus' spirit quotes \\"You're welcome\\" and disappears. Animus reappeared later as a human boy named \\"Kite\\" and befriended the Rangers. As Kite, he first appeared in a dark spiritual dimension where Kite had the Rangers complete a puzzle to get the Falcon Wild Zord. Unknown to the Rangers at the time, they also released Animus' spirit back to the living world, resurrecting him in the form of Kite who was amnesic. As Kite, the Rangers encountered Animus several times and he helped them, particularly against Flute Org when Kite became Animus again for a short time to destroy the monster's flute and then against Lion Tamer Org when Kite broke the monster's hold on the Wild Zords. After he revealed himself as Animus, he took the Wild Zords away after freeing the Wild Force Megazord from Mandilok's control device, feeling that the Rangers were unworthy of their zords as humanity had done so much damage to the world on their own without the Orgs. He offers Merrick a chance to join with him (because of their friendship 3,000 years ago) but Merrick turned him down. After witnessing how truly committed the Rangers are to defending Earth and fight on even without their Zords, as well as seeing ordinary humans risk themselves to save others, Animus reveals that all of this was part of a test that they passed, and he returns the Wild Zords and gives Cole a powerful motorcycle to replace the one Cole lost protecting Kite during an earlier battle. Animus reappeared again during the finale as he faces against the Master Org, Merrick assists him with the Predazord. However, Master Org proved to be stronger and destroyed Animus and the Predazord. Animus reverts to the form of Kite before finally dying. The Zord components of Animus were later seen when the Wild Zords do a combined attack with the Rangers to destroy Master Org. Animus is voiced by Charles Gideon David and Kite is played by Ryan Goldstein. =Alpha 7= Alpha 7 was the fourth Alpha robot in Power Rangers. He is featured in Forever Red, where he is seen helping Tommy Oliver and Andros on the Astro Megaship Mark II. He has Alpha 5's voice and demeanor, but his appearance is made up of pieces of both Alpha 5 and Alpha 6. Alpha 7 was voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz (who also voiced Alpha 4 and Alpha 5). Orgs Orgs are the Wild Force Rangers' antagonists, pollution-oriented creatures that seek to take over the Earth. An Org's life-force is connected to its horn for if it loses them, it is greatly weakened. Unlike humans, they lack blood (which was a hint that Zen-Aku wasn't a true Org when he had possessed Merrick). =Master Org= Master Org is a name that applies to two villains in the story of Power Rangers: Wild Force. One of them is the original Master Org, who led the battle against the Animarium 3,000 years ago and destroyed Animus. However, that Master Org was destroyed by Merrick Baliton, the guardian of Princess Shayla who was empowered by the evil wolf mask of Zen-Aku. Years later, a human reincarnated \\"Master Org\\", the scientist Dr. Viktor Adler and his companions Richard and Elizabeth Evans discovered the seeds that remained of Master Org while on an expedition to prove the existence of the Animarium. Driven by his jealousy toward Richard, who unfairly married Elizabeth and had taken the spotlight from him when they announced that they would be searching for the Animarium, Dr. Adler took the seeds secretly, and out of personal revenge, swallowed them and gained the powers of an Org, murdering his companions in cold blood, but never finding Cole. Dr. Viktor Adler became the second Master Org wearing a helmet with a fake horn and third eye. He was aided by the Duke Orgs Jindrax and Toxica, who later found out his secret. He temporarily turned them into slaves, but they escaped. After repeated defeats at the hands of the Wild Force Rangers, Dr. Adler fought them himself, but not before revealing to Cole what he did to his parents. In the process, he lost his Org powers and was killed by Mandilok. However, from Dr. Adler's death, the true Master Org was reborn, with a real Org horn and third eye on his forehead. He sent Duke Org Onikage to arrange for his return and destroys Toxica. When he arrived, he destroyed Mandilok and kidnapped Shayla. He then invoked a ceremony to create an Org Heart, in which he used the power of Princess Shayla's necklace, summoning Retinax, Nayzor, and Mandilok to guard him. He swallowed the Heart, and his human body crumbled into dust. Unfortunately, Master Org used the Org Heart to create a full-Org body, which resembled a composite of the three General Org, and had taken the Nexus Blade as his weapon. He emerged the next day and attacked the Animarium, destroyed the Predazord and Animus, and was seemingly destroyed by the Kongazord Striker, but the Org Heart quickly restored his body. He then proceeded to destroy the Kongazord Striker, as well as every Wild Zord, (therefore, the Rangers lose their powers) and brought the Animarium down to Earth. He attacked Turtle Cove, but was destroyed when the Wild Zords were all revived and countless others combined powers with them. Master Org was hit with an Ultra Roar, and disappeared into nothingness. The Org Heart itself was then destroyed by the Red Lion Ranger and the Lunar Wolf Ranger with the Jungle Sword. With the destruction of Master Org, Dr. Viktor Adler could finally rest in peace. Master Org is played by Ilia Volok. =Org Generals= The Org Generals (or General Orgs) are higher-ranking Duke Orgs that are Master Org's most powerful servants. They all have a single horn on their heads, a long cape, and are generally themed after some kind of body part. Retinax Retinax is an Org General and the bodyguard of Master Org. He is an eye-themed Org and his name is combination of retina and axe. After his master's destruction, he roamed the planet in secrecy, believing he had failed. He was later found by Toxica and Jindrax, who told him Master Org had returned. Seeking to redeem himself, he attempted to destroy the Rangers. However, he was defeated by the Wild Force Megazord (empowered by a newly hatched Soul Bird) and then destroyed by Master Org (whom he did not recognize because he was the human Viktor Adler). Retinax was brought back with the other General Orgs Nayzor and Mandilok to defend the pillars used in the Org Heart ceremony. He was defeated, but returned fused together with the other Generals as Master Org's new body. In battle, Retinax uses an axe with an eye embedded in it, which also forms part of the Nexus Blade. This General Org can also shoot electricity from his main eye and can extend his arms to wrap around enemies. Retinax is voiced by Michael Sorich. Nayzor Nayzor was one of three General Orgs modeled after parts of the face being modeled after a nose and ears. His name comes from the word nasal. 3000 years ago, he protected the Animal Crystals of the Dark Wild Zords, along with the cursed wolf mask needed to control them. He confronted Merrick Baliton when the latter tried to take the crystals, but failed to stop his escape. As a result, Master Org is destroyed by the Predazord, and Merrick becomes corrupted by the mask, become the evil Zen-Aku. In the present, Nayzor is revived by Master Org to destroy the Rangers, and unleashes Zen-Aku. When Zen-Aku begins to remember who he is, Nayzor suppresses his memories with a strange insect. After the curse of the Wolf Mask was broken by the Wild Force Rangers, Nayzor uses the animal crystals stolen by Zen-Aku to create the powerful Quadra Org. Along with Jindrax and Toxica, he oversaw the new Org's battle against the Rangers. However, the Org is beaten by Merrick, now the Lunar Wild Force Ranger, forcing Nayzor to join the battle personally. Despite his power, the General Org is defeated and destroyed by Merrick, leaving only his crown behind. Toxica steals the crown to access its power, briefly becoming the General Org Necronomica before her defeat by the Rangers. At Master Org's command, she later revives Nayzor as Super Nayzor, who pounds on the Lunar Wolf Ranger, completely annihilating him. The Rangers join in the fight, but Super Nayzor defeats them too, even knocking them out, save Merrick and Cole, who both charge Nayzor only to be defeated again. Right before the killing blow, Animus intervenes and teleports all the Rangers to safety. Cole and Merrick decide to attack Super Nayzor again, who almost kills them after much fighting, but Cole summoned the Falcon Summoner (a gift from his unconscious teammates who all had a shared dream) and destroyed Super Nayzor, who grew to enormous height thanks to Master Org. Cole and his team defeat Super Nayzor with the Isis Megazord. Nayzor is revived in his normal form during the ceremony of the Org Heart, and is ordered to guard one of the pillars involved in the ceremony. He wrecks the Lunar Wolf Ranger and the White Ranger again, but is finally pinned by Merrick, allowing Alyssa to destroy the pillar. He appears later as a part of Master Org's new Org form. In his normal form, Nayzor uses a paper fan that can deflect projectiles back at enemies. The fan is also used in the formation of the Nexus Blade, acting as the hilt of the sword-like weapon. He could also fire electricity from the purple colored gem on his chest. In his Super Form, Nayzor used a staff tipped with hook-like claws identical to the ones on his knuckles. and feet. In Super Form, Nayzor could also manipulate electricity with his hands and from his eyes. Nayzor is voiced by Ken Merckx. Mandilok Mandilok was the leader of the three General Orgs based on parts of the face and the hermaphrodite of the bunch. Mandilok was themed on the mouth, having dozens of them all over his body. Mandilok had both male and female voices, and an appetite that could not be satisfied. It was revived by Jindrax and Toxica to destroy Viktor Adler and did so, but then treated the Duke Orgs like dirt. In battle, Mandilok used a giant fork and knife that could combine into a massive staff. These were used in the formation of the Nexus Blade. Mandilok could also breathe fire from the mouth with the male voice on his stomach and could also manipulate electricity with its hands. Mandilok was later killed by a returning Master Org, but was revived by him to help Retinax and Nayzor guard the Nexus during the Org Heart ceremony. It was destroyed again, but reappeared as part of Master Org's new body. Its name is a pun on the word mandible. Mandilok's upper female face is voiced by Barbara Goodson while the lower male face is voiced by Ezra Weisz. =Dukes of Orgs= The Duke Orgs serve Master Org and/or the Org Generals. Like the Org Generals, they have a single horn on their heads, but their capes tend to be somewhat shorter. Toxica Toxica is Jindrax's partner and best friend. a narwhal-like themed Duke Org and the Mistress of Magic. She can resurrect fallen Orgs and cause them to grow by reciting the spell, \\"Evil spirits of toil and strife, give this fallen Org new life\\" and firing some magic beans from her staff, which grow into vines that recreate and enlarge the Org's body. She and Jindrax hid themselves for centuries after Master Org's defeat, and were the first to rejoin him in the Nexus when he re-emerged. Toxica grew suspicious of Master Org, when she saw him adjust his horn, something no real Org should be able to do. After General Nayzor was destroyed, Toxica temporarily used his crown to become the General Org Necronomica. This form was defeated by the Rangers and she regressed back to normal. Master Org was not pleased with Toxica's act and zapped her until Jindrax vouched for her. Toxica and Jindrax later received newer forms from Master Org when they exposed him, and were brainwashed, becoming the submissive slaves Super Jindrax and Super Toxica. However, they were later freed, and unleashed the General Org Mandilok to aid them against Master Org. Duke Org Onikage tricked her into cutting off her horn, telling her that it would grow back (a lie) and without it, she would survive to the painful effects of the Sacred water. While she was saved from the water's effects, the loss of her horn left her mortally weakened and she was soon destroyed by Mandilok when he used her as a human shield against the rangers' Jungle Blaster. Jindrax then re-energized Toxica's severed horn by tricking the Rangers into firing the Jungle Blaster at it (backstabbing the Locomotive Org in the process), and used it to resurrect her from the Spirit world she was trapped in. She aided the Rangers by rescuing Princess Shayla, and then left with Jindrax to travel the world, \\"find themselves\\" and bid farewell. Curiously, the next day, Master Org's final body included a gauntlet on its right arm that resembled Toxica's helmet. Toxica is played by Sin Wong who also voiced Necronomica and Super Toxica. Jindrax Jindrax is an Ibaraki-dōji-themed Duke Org, the Master of Blades and the best friend and partner of Toxica. and they serve as the primary henchman of Master Org. Jindrax is known for his skill with knives (and occasionally swords), and uses them constantly in battle - he was particularly a battle rival to Taylor. In a few episodes, he causes monsters to grow using Toxica's staff and reciting the spell, \\"Evil spirits of toil and strife, give this fallen Org new life!\\" He is also fond of the word \\"Inconceivable\\". He was later transformed and brainwashed, along with Toxica, into Super Jindrax by Master Org after they discovered that he was a human. He is released from this state after being defeated by the Animarium Armor, and set out with Toxica to free the general Mandilok; together, they were able to depose Master Org (having since lost his powers) and seemingly kill him for good. However, the two were mistreated under Mandilok, and Toxica was actually destroyed in battle with the Rangers. He has a brother named Juggelo, who was imprisoned along with the other Orgs 3000 years ago. Together, the two form \\"Team Carnival\\". In one episode, Jindrax eats Toxica's magic beans to grow large and fight alongside Juggelo. After Juggelo is destroyed, the effect of the beans wears off and Jindrax shrinks to his normal size. This makes him the only Org ever to grow large and return to normal (indeed, Toxica warned him that this was normally not possible). After Juggelo's death, Toxica joins Team Carnival in his stead. Jindrax later brought Toxica back from the netherworld she had been sent to by charging her severed horn with energy from the Rangers' weapons. The two aided the Rangers in the final battle with Master Org, and then left to travel the world with Toxica, \\"find themselves\\" and bid farewell. Strangely, the next day, Master Org reappeared in a form with a left-arm gauntlet or growth resembling the top of Jindrax's head. Jindrax was voiced by Richard Cansino for four episodes, and later his suit actor Danny Wayne Stallcup who played Jindrax in his human-guise. Zen-Aku Zen-Aku is a wolf-themed Duke Org, cursed ages ago and imprisoned within a wolf mask. When Master Org defeated Animus, Merrick took it upon himself to defeat him. Knowing that he did not have enough power to defeat Master Org alone, he obtained the cursed wolf mask and used it to summon the Dark Wild Zords. Although Merrick was able to defeat Master Org with the power of the Predazord, he was soon corrupted by the mask's power, allowing Zen-Aku to take control. With his willpower failing against the curse, Merrick begged his comrades to kill him before he killed them, but instead, they sealed him into a stone coffin to protect the world from Zen-Aku's power. Centuries later, Zen-Aku was released by Nayzor to destroy the Wild Force Rangers. As Zen-Aku, he battled them on several occasions, proving to be more than a match in battle - even stealing some of their zords for himself - until the Rangers learned the truth about his past and helped free Merrick from the curse. As it turned out, Merrick's transformation was caused by the full moon, (similar to the transformation of a werewolf) and Zen-Aku's power was weaker during the waning of the moon and during lunar eclipses. During a battle, Princess Shayla realized that the power of the curse was connected to the Predazord and told the Rangers to destroy the Predazord to break the curse. With help from the Rhino and Armadillo Wild Zords, the Wild Force Megazord was able to destroy the Predazord, thus breaking the curse due to the power of the curse being connected to the Predazord. Unfortunately, when the Rangers broke the curse that corrupted the Predazord, they also lifted the original curse that trapped Zen-Aku in the wolf mask. After regenerating his true form, Zen-Aku and the Lunar Wolf Ranger fight, with Merrick being completely wrecked by Zen-Aku, who attempted to absorb him to regain the power he'd had when they were bonded together. Princess Shayla revealed that the curse had split Zen-Aku's power among the mask, Merrick, and the Dark Zords; with the curse broken, it had all concentrated within Zen-Aku himself. When the Rangers finally convinced Merrick to accept their help, they were able to overwhelm Zen-Aku, but the Duke Org responded by growing in size. In this state, he overpowered both the Wild Force Megazord and the Predazord, deflecting everything they threw at him. Fortunately, Merrick used a pool trick he'd learned from his friend Willie to send the Armadillo Zord flying into Zen-Aku's face, destroying his horn and badly weakening him. The Lunar Wolf Ranger then struck him with the Revolver Phantom, causing Zen-Aku to crumble to dust, seemingly defeated. In the finale, Zen-Aku is seen alive and seeks redemption just like Merrick. They are last seen in or near a forest about to begin their journey together. He was voiced by Dan Woren in earlier episodes and by Lex Lang in later episodes. Artilla Artilla is one of the Duke Orgs that were freed by Mandilok. It is a powerful tank-themed Duke Org. He and Helicos attacked Turtle Cove and fought the Rangers. He was destroyed first by the Falcon Summoner and then by the Isis Megazord with the Final Strike attack. Artilla is voiced by Michael Sorich. Helicos Helicos is one of the Duke Orgs that were freed by Mandilok. Helicos is a powerful helicopter-themed Duke Org that can fly. He and Artilla attacked Turtle Cove and fought the Rangers. He was destroyed first by the Jungle Sword and then by the Isis Megazord's Final Strike attack. Helicos is voiced by Dave Mallow. Juggelo Juggelo is a juggling Duke Org and Jindrax's brother, they team up with Juggelo calling them \\"Team Carnival.\\" They attacked Taylor, Max and Kite at a carnival, even to when Jindrax ate the growth seeds to join him. Juggelo was destroyed first by the Jungle Blaster's Savage Blast and then by the Wild Force Megazord Soul Cannon and Jindrax shrunk back to normal. Juggelo is voiced by Patrick Thomas. Onikage Onikage is a ninja-based Duke Org who appeared seemingly out of nowhere to aid Mandilok. However, he was actually working for Master Org, preparing things for his return. He wields a katana-like saber in battle, but his true ability lies in his illusion powers. He can turn himself and others invisible, generate holograms of varying complexity, and fire beams of light that create murderous clones of anyone they hit. Once he became gigantic, he also displayed the ability to rip open dimensions and transport others to the spirit world, where he and the souls of deceased Orgs would team up on his unlucky victims. He succeeded in capturing Princess Shayla, getting rid of Toxica, and setting up Mandilok to be destroyed. Onikage then used his ninja powers to create the Shadow Rangers, evil clones of the Rangers, whom the Rangers could not damage without hurting themselves. Jindrax upset his plans by reflecting one of his blasts back at him, creating a clone that Cole destroyed with the Falcon Summoner, thereby destroying Onikage as well. Thanks to Master Org, he returned as a giant, and fought the Rangers in another dimension where the spirits of defeated Orgs reside. Princess Shayla's distress for her friends caused the Wild Zords to form into the Pegasus Megazord on their own and travel into the other dimension to face Onikage. After a brief fight, he was destroyed by the Pegasus Megazord with the Pachyderm Crusher attack. Onikage is voiced by Dan Woren. =MutOrgs= In the year 3000, only three Orgs remained of the once great army that battled Animaria. Imprisoned in statues, they were stumbled upon by Ransik. When he learned that his cause-taking over the world-was the same as their own, he released them. They copied his DNA, combining the invulnerability of Mutants with their ancient Org powers. In exchange, they gave Ransik the power to pull weapons from his body. After Ransik's incarceration, the MutOrgs (who spoke their own language, which was English played in reverse) escaped into the past to seek out Master Org. After thoroughly trouncing the Wild Force Rangers several times, they find him. However, the MutOrgs are then met in battle by the combined Time Force/Wild Force teams, as well as by Ransik. When they attempt to summon an energy blast, Ransik leaps in, taking the blast at point blank and causing it to wash back over the MutOrgs. As a result, their Mutant halves are destroyed, and their Org halves soon follow at the combined attacks of the Time Force Rangers and the Wild Force Rangers. Their names are Takach, Kired, and Rofang. They were named for fans Jason Takach, Derik Smith, and Joe Rovang. They replace the Three Org Brothers from Gaoranger (Zeus Org, Poseidon Org, and Hades Org), since the latter's suits were reported to have been destroyed in a fire before filming could take place. Instead, the three MutOrgs are made up of parts of various other monster costumes in repainted form and with horns added onto the heads: * Rofang has the repainted head and right arm of Body Switcher, the repainted body of Darkliptor, sword of Cyborg Ecliptor, the left shoulder armor of Strikning, and the boots of Prince Gasket. * Takach has the head and boots of Strikning, the repainted body of Gatekeeper, the left arm of unused Ohranger monster Bara Police, the right arm of unused GoGoV monster Jeeruda (referred to as \\"Abominus\\" in the Lightspeed Rescue video game while unused in the TV series), and the repainted weapons of Tire Org. * Kired has the head and body of Deviot's Keonta-Spell form, the repainted right arm of Beetleborgs Metallix monster Repgillian, the wings of unused GoGoV monster Zairen (the inspiration for Mermatron in the Lightspeed Rescue video game who also briefly appears in an advanced form in \\"Sorcerer of the Sands\\"), and the boots of Radster. Takach and Kired are voiced by David Lodge, and Rofang is voiced by Kim Strauss. =Machine Empire RemnantsPutrids= The Putrids are a weak and underdeveloped version of Org that serves as the Org Empire's foot soldiers. They are usually summoned by a pink slime from a conch shell-like container that Toxica carries with her. They are basically young Orgs, with their underdeveloped horns indicating their (lack of) strength. They wield kanabos in battle, which can also launch massive blasts of flame. When Toxica pours her slime on the ground and the Putrids form, similar to Ivan Ooze's foot soldiers Oozemen and/or Tengu Warriors, they perform a strange dance: they keep touching their heads. Because of this, one can assume that an Org's weak spot is his/her horn (and perhaps their greatest shame is to have the horn severed). =Org Monsters= The Monster Orgs first appear as spirits that possess an object, basing their forms and powers on the nature of the object. Unlike the Duke Orgs, they have two horns. When beaten, their bodies dissolve into pale green ooze. To make an Org grow, Toxica would perform a spell while chanting: \\"Evil spirits of toil and strife, give this fallen Org new life!\\" After this chant, Toxica would thrust her staff forward, launching seeds at the Org ooze; upon implantation, the seeds rapidly grow into twisted vines that reconstitute the fallen Org as a giant. * Plug Org (voiced by Tom Wyner) - As a result of an Org Spirit acquiring a plug, it's one of two Orgs that attacked Turtle Cove.

It was destroyed by the Kongazord Clutcher Mode. * Flute Org (voiced by Monica Louwerens) - As a result of an Org Spirit acquiring a flute, it interrupts Shayla and Merrick's performance for the Deer Zord and is powered up from Toxica and Jindrax's energy.

It arrived at the front southwest of Moscow in December, in time to take part in the winter counteroffensive. During most of 1942 and into 1943 the division served in primarily defensive roles in 61st Army along the northern face of the German-held salient around Oryol. Following the Soviet victory at Kursk the 342nd took part in the operation that eliminated that salient, and then in the further offensives that liberated Bryansk and pushed on towards Smolensk and the Dniepr River. During these tactical-level actions the division distinguished itself sufficiently to be re-designated as the 121st Guards Rifle Division, one of the last Guards divisions to be formed before the postwar period. In November 1944, a new 342nd was formed in the Far East, and saw action against Japanese forces in northern Manchuria, assaulting across the Sungach river during the Soviet invasion of that region. Well after the war this formation was re- designated and became the 33rd Motor Rifle Division.  1st Formation  The division formed for the first time on September 9, 1941, in the Saratov area of Volga Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1146th Rifle Regiment * 1148th Rifle Regiment * 1150th Rifle Regiment * 912th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 84 Lt. Col. Aleksandr Ippolitovich Popov took command of the division on the day it was formed; on November 28 he was promoted to colonel, and he remained in command until November 9, 1942.http://www.generals.dk/general/Popov/Aleksandr_Ippolitovich/Soviet_Union.html. Note this source misstates the year Popov left command of the division. =Battle of Moscow= After two months of forming up and training, in November the 342nd was assigned to the new 61st Army, which was also forming up in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command before being assigned to Southwestern Front. Colonel Popov was replaced in command by Col. Grigorii Ivanovich Kanachadze, who would lead the division through the winter battles and well into 1943. As the Soviet forces advanced westward in December the 324th, which had moved to Bryansk Front, was on the right flank of its Army, linking with 10th Army of Western Front. By 1200 hrs. on December 26 the division was engaged in fighting remnants of the German 112th Infantry Division along the line Belyi Kolodez - Chermoshny, arriving at a line south of Arsenyevo by the end of the day with the remaining divisions of 61st Army echeloned to its rear. In late January 1942, the 342nd found itself holding against German counterattacks in the fighting around Belyov, holding the line Veino - Dolbino - Fatyanovo south of that town on January 20. Over the next 10 days 61st Army concentrated its efforts against the enemy's Bolkhov group, and on the last day of the month the division remained in a fire battle along the same line, but the momentum of the winter counteroffensive was spent.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4; part V, ch. 8 =Operations in 1942 - 1943= During the winter advance the division reached positions roughly along the Oka River, and it would remain fighting along the line of this river until the summer of 1943, mostly with 61st Army, which was assigned either on the southern flank of Western Front or the northern flank of Bryansk Front throughout this period.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 84 Following the Soviet victory at Stalingrad, Bryansk Front joined in the general winter offensive along the southern half of the front, in its case against positions held by elements of German Second Panzer Army. On February 12, 61st Army launched a dawn attack with 12th Guards, 342nd and 356th Rifle Divisions, backed by the 68th Tank Brigade, against the defenses of the 112th Infantry Division north of Bolkhov, but within hours the assault faltered in the face of withering German fire. The Army's commander, Lt. Gen. Pavel Belov, ascribed the setback to insufficient ammunition and blowing snow which hindered the fire of the tanks. A further effort was made on this sector beginning on February 22, with the main attack being made by Western Front's 16th Army, supported by 61st and 3rd Armies. The intention was to collapse the German- held salient around Oryol in concert with attacks from the south by 13th and 48th Armies. Once again, the 12th Guards and 68th Tanks were sent in against 112th Infantry, and were repelled with serious losses for the guardsmen. Acknowledging defeat on this sector, Bryansk Front commander Col. Gen. M.A. Reiter ordered the 342nd, plus the 356th and 12th Guards, to be transferred to 3rd Army, where they were to reinforce that Army's bridgehead on the west bank of the Oka. This reinforcement helped to contain the numerous German counterattacks against this bridgehead between February 27 and March 1, but continued pressure finally forced 3rd Army to abandon the bridgehead by March 12, and the division reverted to 61st Army.David M.

Logvin Danilovich Chervony took command of the division from Colonel Kanachadze; the former would be promoted to Major General on September 1 and would later be named a Hero of the Soviet Union. Following the German defeat at Kursk, the 342nd was finally able to advance into the Oryol salient, and on July 20 was awarded one of the first honorifics for the liberation of an occupied place, in this case, Mtsensk.http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/1-ssr-4.html. Recovered Apr. 21, 2017 During August it took part in the Soviet summer offensive that liberated Bryansk and drove to the Dniepr River between Bobruisk and Mogilev. Although these attacks never resulted in an actual breakthrough and were accompanied with disproportionate Soviet casualties, the division was noted for its successes in tactical-level operations in the late summer, and on September 23 was re-designated as the 121st Guards Rifle Division in the 80th Rifle Corps of the 3rd Army in the Bryansk Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 84  2nd Formation  On November 22, 1944, the 342nd was formed again, this time in the 2nd Red Banner Army of the Far Eastern Front.

Established in 1865, it was the first church not a part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Utah. The congregation started Utah's first free public schools. History=Founding and construction of first building= The church was founded in a period when mining activity had started to attract non-Mormons to the Utah Territory. The American Home Missionary Society sent minister Norman McLeod to the Utah Territory to minister to military personnel and other non-Mormons, as well as to evangelize to the Mormon population. The first worship service that McLeod conducted in Salt Lake City, on 22 January 1865, was the city's first Protestant religious service. McLeod delivered a strong anti-Mormon message in his sermons, attracting large audiences. Soon a congregation was formally organized. At first, services were held in rented space and at Fort Douglas (where McLeod was the military chaplain), but by mid-February the congregation was actively planning to construct a church building of its own. The building project was aided by donations by supporters in California. The church's first permanent home, named Independence Hall, was an adobe building at Third South, west of Main, built at a cost of $5000 and designed to seat 200 people. The church moved into Independence Hall and began holding services there in November 1865. =Setback in 1866 and thereafter= In March 1866, McLeod traveled to the eastern United States to raise money for the Utah ministry. He also delivered anti-Mormon lectures and testified before a congressional committee. In October 1866, while McLeod was on his trip back to Utah, Dr. J. King Robinson, a physician who was superintendent of the Sunday school that McLeod had started, was murdered in Salt Lake City under circumstances that caused the murder to be characterized as an \\"assassination\\". After learning of Robinson's death, McLeod decided not to return to Utah immediately. He did not get back to the territory until 1872. During McLeod's prolonged absence, the Congregational church became inactive. =Involvement with public education and other non-Mormon groups= In its early years, Independence Hall served as a meeting place for many other non-Mormon religious and civic groups in the community. Roman Catholic religious services were held there beginning in 1866 and Episcopal services began in 1867. The Episcopalians were its principal tenants in the period of Congregational inactivity between Robinson's 1866 murder and McLeod's 1872 return. The hall was also the site of Jewish services, civic and political meetings, dances, and Masonic and Odd Fellows activities. The Congregational Chinese Sunday School and Evening School, a school that was started in 1883 to teach English and Christianity to Chinese immigrants, was based in Independence Hall for several years. During the early history of First Congregational Church, there was no free public education in Utah Territory; the only schools in Salt Lake Valley were private schools that charged tuition fees. To help provide education for children whose families could not afford to pay for tuition, in 1878 First Congregational began sponsoring some free-tuition schools, including Pilgrim Day School on the corner of Seventh East and Fifth South. By 1883 there were 33 free-tuition schools in Utah sponsored by First Congregational or other Congregational churches. In 1890 there were 36 schools serving about 2,500 students, staffed largely by women from eastern states. The number of Congregational schools declined after 1890 due to a combination of factors, and the last such school in Utah closed in 1920. =New church building in 1892= In 1889 the congregation decided to replace Independence Hall with a larger building that could better accommodate the growth it was experiencing. Independence Hall's location in the city's growing central business district made it advantageous to sell the property and move to a new site outside the downtown area. After Independence Hall was sold for $50,000, a new church, located at the corner of First South and Fourth East, was built for a cost of $40,000. The new church, which opened for worship in May 1892, was a gray sandstone building with Romanesque architectural elements, designed by architect Warren H. Hayes. It could hold up to 1200 people in its octagonal sanctuary, with seating for 550 on the main floor, 250 in the balcony, and an additional 400 in the adjoining Sunday school room that was separated from the sanctuary by a moveable partition. The Chinese school that had been based in Independence Hall continued to operate in the new church building. In 1894 it was renamed the Chinese Christian Association and Evening School. =Move to current building= In 1965, First Congregational moved to a new building at 2150 Foothill Drive. The congregation transferred the pipe organ from the 1892 church into the new building. Built by Farrand and Votey, it was the largest organ in Utah when it was first installed in the old church, with 45 ranks, 70 stops, and 2,745 pipes. Denominational affiliation and membership data When most American Congregational churches participated in forming the new United Church of Christ in the late 1950s, the First Congregational Church did not join them. Instead, it chose to affiliate with the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches. As of 2001, it was the only Utah church with this denominational affiliation. The church had about 300 members as of 2001.

The long valley begins at the village of Øvre Eidfjord and ends at the Sysendalen valley on the western side of the Hardangervidda plateau. The valley contains one of the most notable waterfalls in the country: Vøringfossen, which is easily accessible via Norwegian National Road 7 (Rv7). View of the \\"old\\" road through Måbødalen The first road through the Måbødalen valley was built from 1900 to 1916. Consisting of three tunnels and three bridges, including the Måbø Bridge, it is characterized by its many hairpin turns. The road is widely used by pedestrians and cyclists today and it is regarded as a good example of early 20th century road engineering. This was the first road connection between Eastern and Western Norway over the Hardangervidda plateau when it was finally completed in 1928. A new road through Måbødalen was opened in 1986, and it replaced the old road (which was not removed). The new road is wider and has many more tunnels to replace the narrow, old road and all its hairpin turns. The Måbødalen bus accident occurred in 1988 on the new road. The Fossli Hotel is situated on top of the mountain, overlooking the Måbødalen valley and the Vøringfossen waterfall, just off Rv7. The hotel owns a Zimmermann piano where Edvard Grieg composed Norwegian Folk Songs, Opus 66 (1896). In 1854, Johan Christian Dahl painted Måbødalen, a landscape painting of the area.

It depicts six young men in and around a boat, bathing in the sea. It was painted near Falmouth and exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1902, along with two other works by Tuke, The Run Home and Portrait of Alfred de Pass. It was one of his greatest successes. The painting measures by . It was acquired by the City of London Corporation and is displayed at the Guildhall Art Gallery. Background Henry Scott Tuke, August Blue (1893-94; Tate Britain, London). Tuke was born in York in 1858, but his family moved to Falmouth the following year, where it was hoped the milder climate would ameliorate the tuberculosis suffered by his father, the physician Daniel Hack Tuke. He showed early talent for art, and studied at the Slade School of Art in London in 1874-79 and Paris from 1881-83, and also travelled to Italy. He returned to Cornwall to live in Falmouth 1883, and is usually identified as a member of the Newlyn school. Many of his works involve boys or young men, often in or beside the sea, and usually naked, although generally in a position where their genitals are hidden from view. Painting The painting depicts six young men at Newporth Beach near Falmouth on a summer's day, in and about a rowing boat on the sea by the shoreline. The painting shows no horizon, making it the open-air space more enclosed and intimate. Four of the subjects are naked: one swimming to the upper left, one resting on rocks to the lower left, one wading and holding the boat to the lower right, and one sitting on the side of the boat in the centre. The two others are clothed: one standing in white trousers holding an oar at the rear of the boat, and one sitting in the boat with white hat and trousers and an eye-catching red top. A detail from Ruby, Gold and Malachite, with Charlie Mitchell as model. The painting is ambiguous, and can be read in several ways: as a celebration of athletic masculinity; a representation of the innocence and purity of youth, unselfconscious in a natural setting; an image of a lost rural idyll; a depiction of the sons of empire; or (in the aftermath of the Boer War) as celebration of pleasure and an implicit criticism of the militarisation of youth. Many commentators note Tuke's acquaintance with the Uranian movement and discern a homoerotic charge. The title Ruby, Gold and Malachite – referring to the red, yellow and green tones used in the work – echo an essay by John Addington Symonds, and may refer back to the opening lines of a poem \\"The Sundew\\" published by Algernon Swinburne in 1866: \\"A little marsh-plant, yellow-green, // And pricked at lip with tender red\\". The poem describes a lovers' tryst in marshland, witnessed by a sundew. Swinburne's poem was the inspiration for Tuke's 1894 work, August Blue, the title of Tuke's painting being a quotation from the closing lines of the poem. Tuke used several of his regular models for the work, including the brothers Richard and Georgie Fouracre, Bert White, Harry Cleave, and Charlie Mitchell (1885–1957, shown resting on the rocks in the lower left) who was Tuke's boatman for 30 years. Tuke left Mitchell £1,000 in his will. Reception Pictures of naked youths outside of a classical context were not generally acceptable in this period, with a notable exception for depictions of bathing: another prominent example is Thomas Eakins' The Swimming Hole (1883–5). Tuke was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1900 and a full member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1914. His work remained popular until the First World War ended the gilded age of late Victorian and Edwardian England. Tuke's work fell out of favour after the war, and Tuke died in 1929. His work regained popularity after it was discovered by a generation of openly gay art enthusiasts in the 1970s.

The Power Rangers This generation of Power Rangers is unique in which they were originally two separate teams; the Wind Rangers of the Wind Ninja Academy and the Thunder Rangers of the Thunder Ninja Academy. After initial hostilities, they banded together and were later joined by the Green Samurai Ranger. During the events of \\"Shattered Grid,\\" when summoned by Zordon, the entire Ninja Storm team appears, including the Thunder Rangers and Cameron. This would indicate that Drakkon had yet to invade their universe prior to Zordon's summons. =Wind Rangers= The Wind Rangers are the last students of the Wind Ninja Academy, given their morphers by Sensei Kanoi Watanabe and his son Cam when the other students were kidnapped by Lothor. Shane Clarke Shane Clarke (Pua Magasiva) is the main character and the Red Wind Ranger. He is the leader of the Ninja Storm team. He has a serious attitude. Shane is an excellent skateboarder, and his love of flight is evident in his fighting style. Shane is scared of spiders. When he was young, Shane saved an alien woman named Skyla from a bounty hunter named Vexacus, and that alien later returned and gave Shane the power of the Battlizer armor.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Shane's Karma\\" After Lothor's defeat, Shane became an instructor at the Wind Ninja Academy. Shane commands the Hawk Ninja Zord.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Storm Before the Calm\\" Shane watches out for his friends and tries to make sure Tori, Dustin, and later Cam stay out of trouble. When the Bradley brothers, Hunter and Blake, show up in town, Shane stresses the importance of knowing whom to trust to Dustin as Shane is the only one to suspect that the brothers aren't who they say they are.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Thunder Strangers\\" Shane doesn't come to trust Hunter or Blake until the incident with Toxipod. During that time, Shane is aggravated with the fact that Hunter and Blake always seem to have ill intentions when their groups meet in battle. When the fact that both Blake and Hunter have been brainwashed by Choobo is revealed to him and his friends, Shane slowly comes to trust Blake and Hunter when they are brought back to their senses.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Return of Thunder\\" Hunter and Shane's differences cause them to develop a rivalry, but they eventually overcome their differences and become friends.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Boxing Bopp-A-Roo\\" Thanks to his ninja training, Shane possesses several superpowers independent of and prior to the acquisition of his Ranger skills. Like his fellow ninjas, Shane possesses superhuman speed and can move faster than the eye can see, leap higher than an average person, evade detection by normal persons, and focus his inner energies to resist mental attacks and manipulation. Shane's ninja powers give him the ability to control the element of air for effects including projecting gusts of wind as an offensive weapon, and \\"walking\\" on air as if on solid ground. Shane's older brother, Porter (played by Pua Magasiva's actual brother, Robbie Magasiva), who was a successful businessman, was concerned about Shane's seeming lack of a sense of responsibility, and paid him a visit, lecturing his younger brother on the matter. After accidentally discovering that Shane was the Red Ranger, however, Porter gained significant respect for Shane, realizing the measure of responsibility that his younger brother had taken upon himself.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Eye of the Storm\\" When Lothor comes back in Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Shane temporarily becomes evil alongside his teammates. They battle the Dino Rangers, but are set free by their comrades. The Ninja and Dino Rangers then team up to do battle with Lothor and Mesogog's combined forces, with him teaming up with Red Dino Ranger Conner.Power Rangers Dino Thunder episode, \\"Thunder Storm\\" Afterwards, the Wind Rangers lose their Ranger powers again, though they would later regain them by Sentinel Knight through some means in order to join the Ranger army in Power Rangers Super Megaforce. Tori Hanson Tori Hanson (Sally Martin) is the main female protagonist, and the Blue Wind Ranger. Tori is the sensible member of the team and a feisty tomboy with a kind heart. She is loyal to her friends, but sticks up for Cam when her fellow Rangers pick on him, and has an innate skill for ending conflicts with words instead of fists. Tori has a fear of her hair being cut off. Tori Hanson has an affinity for water, surfing in her spare time and mastering water based fighting techniques while training at the Wind Ninja Academy. Tori's ninja training has endowed her with skills independent of her Ranger powers. Like her fellow ninjas, Tori possesses superhuman speed and can move faster than the eye can see, leap higher than an average person, evade detection by normal persons, and focus her inner energies to resist mental attacks and manipulation. Her training based on her affinity for water allows her to move across water as if it were solid ground, create high- powered bursts of water as an offensive weapon, and manipulate and control water for a number of effects, such as creating objects. As the Blue Ranger, Tori relies on the power of water to thwart evil, and pilots the Dolphin Zord. In the finale, Tori becomes an instructor at the Wind Ninja Academy. When Lothor comes back in Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Tori temporarily becomes evil alongside her teammates. They battle the Dino Rangers, but are set free by their comrades, Cam, Blake and Hunter. The Ninja and Dino Rangers then team up to do battle with Lothor and Mesogog's combined forces, with her teaming up with Yellow Dino Ranger Kira. Afterwards, the Wind Rangers lose their powers, leaving things to the next generation. In the Power Rangers Operation Overdrive team up episode \\"Once a Ranger\\", Tori is called upon by the Sentinel Knight along with Adam Park, Kira Ford, Bridge Carson, and Xander Bly to relieve the Operation Overdrive Rangers when they lost their powers. Sentinel Knight restored her powers, and she later fought alongside the Overdrive Rangers. It is also revealed that Tori now runs her own surf shop.Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode, \\"Once a Ranger\\" Her powers apparently either remained intact or were later restored again, as she took part in the final battle with the Armada in Power Rangers Super Megaforce. Dustin Brooks Waldo 'Dustin' Brooks (Glenn McMillan) is the co-protagonist and the Yellow Wind Ranger as well as the second male Yellow Ranger (after Tideus, the Yellow Alien Ranger). As such, he is capable of fighting underground and moving through the earth. Dustin pilots the Lion Ninja Zord and his specialized weapon was called the Lion Hammer, which he could slam into the ground and cause small earthquakes. He can also split himself into two separate fighters. Dustin and his fellow Ranger Shane have been best friends since childhood. By the end of the series, Dustin graduates from the Wind Academy and stays on as a teacher. He is the \\"comic book geek\\" of the Wind Rangers, and was a fan of previous Rangers, who were considered urban legend, visible when they are first given morphers and he is the first to morph and (in turn) show Shane and Tori how to morph.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Prelude to a Storm\\" He is somewhat naive and gullible. This is clearly exhibited in his meeting with Hunter and Blake. Dustin is the first to encounter the Thunder Rangers, Hunter and Blake Bradley, and quickly befriends them due to their mutual interest in motocross. Being the friendly guy he is, he introduces Blake and Hunter to Tori and Shane, not knowing that the Bradleys were the Thunder Rangers who were attacking them at the time. Dustin is an expert motocross rider, which he claims his father Jake \\"Taught him everything [he] knows\\", and works at the bike store Storm Chargers. He also uses copious amounts of dudespeak and has some degree of proficiency in the saxophone (he was shown playing a tenor in \\"Shimazu Returns, Part 2\\"). Marah once conned him into believing she had reformed and would help the Rangers defeat Lothor, but it was a ruse. Despite Marah's trickery, Dustin and Marah did seem to harbor interest in each other, but nothing was ever expanded on.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"All About Beevil\\" When Lothor comes back in Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Dustin temporarily becomes evil alongside his teammates. They battle the Dino Rangers, but are set free by their comrades. The Ninja and Dino Rangers then team up to do battle with Lothor and Mesogog's combined forces, with him teaming up with Blue Dino Ranger Ethan. Afterwards, the Wind Ranger loses his Ranger powers but continues on as a teacher in the Wind Ninja Academy. He apparently regained his powers by Sentinel Knight at least temporarily when he joined the Ranger army in Super Megaforce. By the end of the series, Dustin has grown and matured a lot, but his personality remains much the same. =Thunder Rangers= The Thunder Rangers The known Rangers of the Thunder Ninja Academy are the Crimson and Navy Thunder Rangers. The two, who are adoptive brothers, were chosen by Sensei Omino when their academy was attacked by Lothor and have the power of thunder. They were originally enemies of the Wind Rangers, having been lied to by Lothor into believing that the Wind Rangers' sensei was responsible for the death of their parents. They returned to the side of good when they were visited by the spirits of their parents and told them the truth. Their weapons are Thunder Staffs, which can also transform into the Tornado Star (a boomerang weapon), Thunder Shield (a hoop weapon), or can extend into long staffs, to attack their enemies. Each Ranger also carries an individual weapon, the Crimson Blaster and Navy Antler. Their Zords are in the form of beetles. Their powers were absorbed by Lothor into Cam's Samurai Amulet. Hunter Bradley Hunter Bradley is the Crimson Thunder Ranger played by Adam Tuominen and voiced by Scott McShane in the Power Rangers: Super Legends video game. He is the older brother of Blake Bradley, the Navy Thunder Ranger. The two were raised at the Thunder Ninja Academy by Sensei Omino after the death of their adoptive parents. (like Eric Myers from Power Rangers Time Force) Initially brooding and standoffish, Hunter eventually learns the value of friendship and teamwork outside of himself and through his time as a Ranger later warms up to the Wind Rangers; he even gets a job at Storm Chargers, thanks to Dustin. When we first meet Hunter and Blake, they are revealed as the two Thunder Rangers that are out for revenge on the Wind Rangers' sensei, Kanoi Watanabe. This was actually a lie told by Lothor, the real killer of the Bradleys' parents as well as the main antagonist of the story. Because the Thunder Rangers were misled, they became the enemies of the Wind Rangers. This was quickly fixed when their parents' ghosts came to Blake and Hunter and told him that they were after the wrong person. Hunter and Blake leave for a while even though they assure the Wind Rangers that they've turned to the right side, but this changes when an infiltration aboard Lothor's ship goes wrong. While they are on the ship, Choobo captures and brainwashes them so that they become a threat to the Wind Ninja once more. Choobo traps the Wind and Thunder Rangers on an island so that they can kill each other, but the Thunder Rangers regain their memories. As a last resort, Lothor uses a ray that causes Hunter to fly into a rage and attack everyone. Hunter accidentally takes a breath of mist that makes him even more confused and angry, but the Wind Ninjas and Blake later help him come back to his senses. The Bradleys come to fight alongside the Wind Rangers, this time permanently. Hunter became the team's unofficial second-in-command. Hunter later became the head instructor at the Thunder Academy, after Lothor stole his Ranger powers. He maintains a friendly rivalry with Shane. When Lothor returned from the Abyss of Evil during Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Hunter teamed up with Blake and Cam to recover the Thunder and Samurai Powers from the Abyss. They freed the mind-controlled Wind Rangers, and teamed up with the Dino Rangers to face Lothor and Mesogog's combined forces, in which he and Blake fought alongside Black Dino Ranger Tommy Oliver. After the battle, Hunter discovered that his rangers powers had been depleted, thus ending his time as a Power Ranger. He continued on as the head teacher at the Thunder Ninja Academy, later taking up the Ranger mantle again when an army of Rangers was formed to assist the Megaforce Rangers in Power Rangers Super Megaforce. The Crimson Ranger's arsenal included his Thunder Staff, the Crimson Blaster, the Crimson Tsunami Cycle, and the Ninja Glider Cycle, a special motorbike adapted to transform into a motor-propelled glider. His personal Zord was the Crimson Insectizord (which is modeled after a Hercules Beetle). His Power Spheres included the Spin Blade and pieces of the MiniZord and the Ninja Firebird and the Sting Blaster. Blake Bradley Blake Bradley is the Navy Thunder Ranger played by Jorgito Vargas, Jr. and voiced by Kenn Michael in the Power Rangers: Super Legends video game. He is the youngest brother of Hunter Bradley, the Crimson Thunder Ranger. After Blake and Hunter's parents died, their sensei took them in and they began their martial arts training at the Thunder Ninja Academy. More sociable and charming than his older brother, Blake is a skilled motorbike racer and is the best of all the Rangers at stick fighting; being able to take on both Tori and Dustin with ease. In the beginning, Blake, like his brother, are fighting against the Wind Ninja when Lothor feeds the Bradley brothers the lie that the Wind Ninja's sensei was the one who killed their parents when in reality, Lothor was the one to kill them. Blake goes so far as to play on Tori's concerns for him to find the location of Ninja Ops so that he and Hunter can get to Sensei. When Blake and Hunter find that Lothor is the real one responsible for their parents' deaths, they decide to leave Blue Bay Harbor without a word to the others, unsure of themselves and their destiny as Rangers. Blake and Hunter return soon after, now with the resolve to kill Lothor. Blake decides to let Tori in on their plan to infiltrate Lothor's ship, assuring her that they'd call if there was trouble. When Blake and Hunter make the mistake of trusting Choobo to get on the ship, they are both brainwashed again into believing the Wind Rangers were evil. All five Rangers are transported onto an island and they fight each other several times. Blake is the first Thunder Ranger who shakes the brainwashing effects and joins the Wind Rangers in an effort to free Hunter, who is driven mad by the combination of Lothor's memory ray and the toxic mist on the island. After this turn of events, the Thunder Brothers decide to fight alongside the Wind Rangers, deciding that teamwork was the best way to destroy their common enemy Lothor. His Ranger powers are drained by Lothor using Cam's amulet and are seemingly lost when Lothor is sealed within the Abyss. However, in Dino Thunder, the Rangers temporarily regain their powers and fight alongside the Dino Thunder Rangers to fight the combined threat of Lothor and Mesogog. After the battle it is revealed that Blake's morpher is depleted, resulting in the permanent loss of his Ranger powers. Despite this, he would appear as part of the Ranger army in Super Megaforce. Blake's weapons include a Navy Antler, Thunder Staff, and a Thunder Blade. His gear includes a Thunder Morpher and a Tsunami Cycle. He pilots the Navy Beetlezord (which is modeled after a Stag Beetle). He shared the Serpent Sword Power Sphere with Hunter for their Thunder Megazord. =Cameron \\"Cam\\" Watanabe= Cameron \\"Cam\\" Watanabe (Jason Chan) is the son of Sensei Kanoi Watanabe and Miko, nephew of Lothor, and cousin to Marah and Kapri. Kanoi made a promise to Cam's mother that Cam would never be trained in the ways of the ninja. As such, Cam was not a student at the Wind Ninja Academy, but he was a constant presence and usually at his father's side. Unable to train, he began putting his talents to use in the technological arena.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"The Samurai's Journey\\" After the academy was destroyed by Lothor and his minions, Cam took Shane, Tori, and Dustin into a high-tech underground dojo. Under instruction from Sensei Watanabe, who had been turned into a guinea pig, he (reluctantly) presented the three with Wind Morphers, allowing them to become the Wind Rangers. Throughout the series, Cam used his brilliant intellect to construct/maintain power spheres, Zords, and weapons for the Rangers. For example, when Sensei was captured by the Thunder Rangers, Cam created a powerful forcefield to protect his father. After Hunter and Blake joined the team, Cam discovered the mystery piece in their Megazord that would allow the Storm Megazord to combine with the Thunder Megazord. Early on, Cam often displayed a sarcastic personality and low opinion towards Shane, Tori and Dustin. Besides their faulty track record in training, Cam was also jealous that they got to be Rangers and not him. When this became known, Tori suggested Cam talk to his father, while Shane, Dustin, Hunter and Blake argued to Sensei Watanabe that Cam would make the perfect Ranger. Throughout the series, Cam began to change his opinion towards Shane, Tori, and Dustin when Shane, Tori, and Dustin proved him wrong time and time again and eventually he became good friends with them and he began to see them as great Rangers and great ninjas. Soon afterwards, the Rangers' powers were stolen and Lothor was poised for final victory. When Sensei mentioned a great power source lost to time, Cam used the Scroll of Time to travel into the past. He arrived at the Wind Ninja Academy when Kanoi was a student. Surprisingly, he also met an unmentioned twin brother named Kiya as well as a mystery samurai revealed to be Miko, his mother. Miko possessed the Samurai Amulet, which Cam recognized as the great power source he came back for. However, Kiya also wanted it and framed Cam for the theft. Kanoi exposed Kiya's plot – leading to a brutal fight between Cam and his future uncle, who had knowledge of the dark ninja arts. Cam won and had successfully claimed the amulet. Kiya was stripped of name and rank, and banished from Earth. Before he was off-world, Cam witnessed Kiya take the name \\"Lothor\\" and vow revenge. Cam was unable to do anything to change history as he had to return home. Miko let him keep the amulet, allowing Cam to become the Green Samurai Ranger and use the Samurai Star Megazord to save the present. As the Samurai Ranger, he helped the others fight Lothor's evil, still shocked by the discovery that the evil ninja master was his uncle. Because of the demands that being a Ranger put on him, he created a holographic virtual duplicate of himself he dubbed \\"Cyber-Cam\\" to take over day-to-day running of the dojo and maintenance of the equipment. Cyber-Cam was given a \\"thug\\" persona, with wardrobe and vocabulary to match, and was highly skilled in extreme sports; in short, everything that Cam was not. Cyber-Cam briefly locked Cam up, so he could enjoy life. Cam later reprogrammed him to be focused on work in Ninja Ops, though the \\"thug\\" persona and wardrobe remained.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Scent of a Ranger\\" It is noted that after the events of \\"Samurai's Journey,\\" Lothor began to pick on Cam more than the other Rangers. This could be because Cam is his nephew and because Cam was indirectly responsible for Lothor's banishment. Lothor did know it was Cam, as he later recalled their \\"meeting in the past\\". Notably, Cam is the only Ninja Storm Ranger not to be turned evil, like the Thunder Rangers (\\"Return of Thunder\\") and later the Wind Rangers (\\"Thunder Storm\\"). When Lothor was finally defeated, Cam again became an advisor at the Wind Ninja Academy, helping the other Rangers in their instructor duties, and keeping a special watch over Lothor's nieces (and his cousins) Marah and Kapri, who had reformed and enrolled at the academy. Within a year time, he got closer to the girls and shared a bonding moment. When Lothor escaped from the Abyss of Evil in Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Cam later briefly regained his samurai powers and re-teamed with his fellow Ninja Rangers, as well as teaming up with the Dino Rangers, to battle the combined forces of Lothor and Mesogog, in which he teamed up with White Dino Ranger Trent. After the battle, it was revealed that Cam's morpher was fully depleted resulting in the permanent loss of his Ranger powers. However, a means of restoring them-at least temporarily-was apparently found, as he joined the Ranger army in battling the Armada forces that invaded Earth. He would later join his teammates in the final battle with the Armada forces in Power Rangers Super Megaforce. Allies=Sensei Kanoi Watanabe= Sensei Kanoi Watanabe (Grant McFarland as an adult and as a guinea pig, Daniel Sing as a teen) is the mentor of the Wind Rangers and father to Cameron Watanabe. Kanoi Watanabe was originally an air ninja and is also the twin brother of Kiya Watanabe/Lothor. When Lothor attacked the Wind Academy, he used his magic to turn Sensei Watanabe into a guinea pig, albeit with the ability to speak and bipedal movement. Kanoi sensed potential in the three students who became the Wind Rangers. He also sensed it in his son Cameron (Cam), but had promised his wife that he would not train Cam in the ways of the Ninja. So, instead, Cam learned to become a samurai, and met his father in the past before obtaining the Samurai Cyclone Morpher. In a later episode, Cam created a machine that should have returned his father to a human, but instead he swapped bodies with both Shane and Dustin, before finally returning to his trapped hamster body. It reveals he's proficient in Earth Style, despite beginning his ninja training as an Air Style Ninja.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Sensei Switcheroo\\" The Sensei of the alternate dimension that Tori ended up in was also evil like the Ninja Rangers.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"The Wild Wipeout\\" Kanoi was eventually restored to human form when Lothor raided Ninja Ops when hit by Lothor's energy attack. Following Lothor's defeat, Kanoi returned to the Wind Academy. Some time later in Power Rangers Dino Thunder, Kanoi was captured and impersonated by a vengeful Lothor (who had escaped from the Abyss of Evil), who tricked the Wind Rangers and turned them into his servants. Kanoi later escaped with the help of his nieces Marah and Kapri, and helped Cam and the Thunder Rangers recover their powers from the Abyss of Evil. He then worked together with Hayley to advise the Rangers in their team-up battle. =Kelly Halloway= Kelly Halloway (Megan Nicol) is the owner of Storm Chargers, a sporting goods store that the Power Rangers frequent and where Dustin is an employee. Her counterpart in the alternate dimension that Tori visited had a goth-like appearance and was the boss of Zurgane and Choobo. =Cyber-Cam= Cyber-Cam (Jason Chan) is a holographic virtual duplicate of himself he dubbed \\"Cyber-Cam\\" to take over day-to-day running of the dojo and maintenance of the equipment. Cyber-Cam was given a \\"thug\\" persona with wardrobe and vocabulary to match and was highly skilled in extreme sports. In short, Cyber-Cam was everything that Cam was not. Cyber-Cam briefly locked Cam up, so he could enjoy life. Cam later reprogrammed him to be focused on work in Ninja Ops, though the \\"thug\\" persona and wardrobe remained. When it came to Lothor finding the underground dojo, he had Kapri infected Cyber-Cam with a computer virus while he was doing some outside repairs to the manual override and had him lead them into the dojo. Afterwards, he withdrew into the Ninja Ops center. =Kyle, Eric and Tally= A trio of teens resembling Shane, Dustin and Tori, respectively. They first appeared to back up Cam and Hunter while fighting a Kelzak army, and though their help came in handy, Cam warned them to not get in their way. They weren't seen again until the Wind Ninja Academy opened again, enrolling as ninja apprentices. Cam got worried about the continual stress he will go through especially with Eric and his friends. His father assured him to leave their training to Shane, Dustin and Tori. Eric was the twin brother of Conner McKnight the Red Dino Ranger. Both were portrayed by James Napier. Evil Space Ninjas=Lothor= Born Kiya Watanabe, Lothor (portrayed by Grant McFarland as an adult, Daniel Sing as a teenager) is an exiled evil ninja master. His history is revealed by the middle of the season during the \\"Samurai's Journey\\" three-parter. When Cam Watanabe travels back in time to acquire a great power source, he meets younger versions of his parents and learns of an unheard uncle, Kiya. Kiya is shown to be loose with the rules, in contrast to his twin brother, Kanoi. However, nobody expected Kiya to seek to steal the Samurai Amulet (the great power source) from Cam's mother. Attempting to frame Cam, his plan was foiled and exposed by Kanoi. After Cam defeated Kiya in combat, the sensei of the academy banished Kiya from Earth to the farthest parts of space where his evil powers will do no harm. Cam realizes the truth, as Kiya proclaims before being banished, \\"I will take the name of the ancient warrior of evil. From this point, I will be known as Lothor! … I will not forget the part you played in this, brother! I will have my revenge!\\" As a student at the Wind Ninja Academy, he wore a yellow and black uniform, implying that he studied under the Earth element. Lothor spent years in space to slowly build an army of evil space ninja (space aliens trained in the dark ninja arts). He intended to conquer Earth and destroy all the protecting ninja academies with their ninja masters, allowing him to become the ultimate dark ninja master. He also first encountered the bounty hunter, Vexacus, and developed an intense rivalry with him. He also apparently married during his exile, as Kapri and Marah were not blood relatives, though no wife was ever seen or otherwise alluded to. Before his attack on Earth in the first episode, Lothor had returned to Earth previously in secret (a violation of his former sensei's orders). His purpose on this visit is unknown, but while there, he killed the Bradleys, the adoptive parents of Hunter and Blake Bradley. These two were taken in by Sensei Omino and trained at the Thunder Ninja Academy, which, unfortunately, was the first place attacked by Lothor's army. He captured the Thunder Ninja students and Sensei Omino, and even managed to convince Hunter and Blake Bradley that the Wind Ninja's current sensei, Kanoi, was responsible for their adoptive parents' deaths. The Wind Ninja Academy, now under the leadership of Sensei Kanoi Watanabe, Lothor's brother, was the next target. Again, Lothor kidnapped the students of the academy. When they were fighting, Sensei Watanabe turned himself into a guinea pig. Lothor's victory was short-lived, and he soon realized that three students had escaped the purge of the Wind Ninja Academy (Shane, Dustin, and Tori). Being the only three remaining, they were presented with morphers, allowing them to become Wind Power Rangers. These new Power Rangers foiled Lothor's plans on numerous occasions, and he has sent monstrous warriors after them, but they all fail. Nevertheless, he has always stuck by the evil code for destroying a Power Ranger, that \\"they must be in their true Ranger form.\\". Lothor has a campy sense of humor, which is often reflected from his frustrations with his monsters/nieces when they fail to best the Power Rangers, or in some predictable occasions (e.g. after making a monster grow, he stares at the camera and asks the audience if they really expected him to make it smaller.) Such fourth wall breaking manifested itself in several other of Lothor's asides (in the season finale, piloting the final giant robot the Rangers would fight, he comments on the battle was the most fun he'd had all season.) as well. In the final episodes of the series, treason and betrayal among Lothor's generals saw them all dying off - at each other's hands or at the hands of the Power Rangers. It was soon revealed that these deaths had all been a part of Lothor's great plan, and that when each had died, their spirits had gone to the \\"Abyss of Evil\\". With the help of Cam's stolen Samurai Amulet, Lothor was able to make the Abyss overflow and the dead generals and armies were all re-released, free to destroy the world. Shane was quickly able to destroy the resurrected generals with his Battlizer while the other Rangers tossed the other monsters back into the Abyss. Lothor then managed to use Cam's Samurai Amulet to drain the Rangers of their Ranger powers. Fortunately, Shane, Dustin and Tori were able to use their inner ninja powers to seal him and his deceased army in the Abyss of Evil, saving the planet. An alternate dimension that Goldwinger had Tori transported to featured Lothor as a good guy who worked as the Mayor of Blue Bay Harbor and feared this reality's Ninja Rangers. After coming to his senses, Mayor Lothor and his allies helped Tori defeat the evil Ninja Rangers. Almost a year later in Power Rangers Dino Thunder episode \\"Thunder Storm,\\" Lothor escapes from the Abyss of Evil and again captures the ninja students. He lures the Wind Ninja rangers to a beach where he tricks them into accepting new morphers which make them evil. They are eventually freed by the Thunder Rangers and Cam, who have managed to retrieve their old powers. Lothor then teams up with Mesogog, Dino Thunder's main antagonist. After a battle with both Ninja Storm and Dino Thunder, in which both their warriors are defeated, Lothor sends Marah and Kapri to battle against the rangers as a last effort to win. However, he finds out too late both girls had double crossed him. Especially when Lothor sees the rescued Ninja Students freed, along with Marah and Kapri bonding with Cam. Feeling like the alliance is no longer needed, Mesogog fights Lothor and ends up trapping him in a glass jar. Mesogog's Island Base was destroyed a few months later with the final fate of Lothor left unresolved.Power Rangers Dino Thunder episode, \\"Thunder Struck\\" =Lothor's Generals=Zurgane Zurgane is the main general in Lothor's army. He enjoys destroying everything in the service of Lothor. Even though the Thunder Rangers were on Lothor's side at the time, he despised them, for they got the glory and attention that he wanted from Lothor. He is always mocked by his crewmates because he doesn't have a mouth nor eyes. Zurgane is known to be Lothor's technical advisor as he fixes objects on the ship and builds his own evil Zords and even uses robotic monsters. Zurgane's powers are teleportation, energy projection, and the ability to extend swords from his shoulders. An alternate dimension that Goldwinger had Tori transported to had Zurgane with the personality that the normal Choobo has where both of them worked at Storm Chargers. He is among those who help Mayor Lothor fight the evil Ninja Rangers. Zurgane was destroyed by Vexacus, another of Lothor's generals. Vexacus sought absolute power over Lothor's forces, and later collaborated with Marah and Kapri to destroy Motodrone and Shimazu. After the destruction of Zurgane's latest Zord by the Power Rangers, Zurgane is physically in bad shape. Vexacus took advantage of that in order to perform a sneak attack, destroying him.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"General Deception\\" When the Abyss was open Zurgane returned, only to be destroyed again by Shane. He had later returned again from the reopened Abyss in Power Rangers Dino Thunder. He first appeared inside the Abyss with a small pack of monsters to prevent Cam and the Thunder Rangers from reclaiming the Samurai Amulet and left them to fall to their doom after a brief battle. He returned to the surfaced to serve Lothor and was partnered with Elsa of Mesogog's army. He fought against the Thunder Rangers and Tommy Oliver who destroyed him the third time with his Brachio Staff's Energy Orb attack. Zurgane was voiced by Peter Rowley. Choobo Choobo is the lieutenant of Lothor's army. He resembles an overweight Ōnyūdō wearing mountain-climbing equipment with a mustache and green reptilian skin. He wielded a white and red-striped baton and has a Mama's boy-like personality. He can summon energy spheres to trap his enemies. Sometimes, he uses monsters based on animals. He could also suck in opponents into his backpack and send them into his own pocket dimension inside his backpack where he would appear as a giant head that breathed toxic gas and he could control the bodies of his opponents like puppets. He was promoted to general when he captured the Thunder Rangers and manipulated them to oppose the Wind Rangers again. However, he failed to destroy the Rangers and they realized they were being manipulated, so Choobo was banished from Lothor's ship. He swore revenge, and stole the Scroll of Empowerment, which gave him great strength and powers. He was defeated by the Thunderstorm Megazord, but saved by Lothor and shrunk down to be Marah's new pet. Lothor later restored him to normal accidentally. An alternate dimension that Goldwinger sent Tori to had Choobo smarter than Zurgane where both of them worked at Storm Chargers. He is among those who help Mayor Lothor fight the evil Ninja Rangers. Choobo was defeated by Shane as the Red Battlized Ranger although it wasn't quite clear if he was completely destroyed (he was only seen falling down after being blasted by the Battilizer's lasers). Choobo later appears in the video game Power Rangers: Super Legends. Choobo is voiced by Bruce Hopkins in the TV series and by David Lodge in the Power Rangers: Super Legends video game. Motodrone Motodrone was originally Perry, a motorcycle expert who was conducting an experiment to create a new generation of motorcycle. Unfortunately, there was an accident and he became the scorpion-like cyborg Motodrone. Hunter destroyed Motodrone and freed Perry with his newly acquired Ninja Glider Cycle. Motodrone was later rebuilt and revived by Lothor by transferring the soul of a Kelzak.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Brothers in Arms\\"Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Shimazu Returns\\" Motodrone wielded a double-bladed staff, rode on a motorcycle, and wore a brown cloak when he was revived. Motodrone then fought the Power Rangers under the command of Lothor. An alternate dimension that Goldwinger transported Tori to had Motodrone as the aid of Mayor Lothor. He is among those who help Mayor Lothor fight the evil Ninja Rangers. He was later destroyed by Vexacus when he attempted to reveal Vexacus' treacherous agenda to Lothor.Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Gem of a Day\\" He came back once more from the Abyss, but was quickly defeated one final time by Shane (although like the other generals, it was not revealed if he was completely destroyed since he was only seen falling down after being blasted). Motodrone is voiced by Craig Parker. Vexacus Vexacus is a shark-like alien bounty hunter and the \\"sworn enemy\\" and rival of Lothor, who ended up working for Lothor whilst plotting against him. Vexacus wielded a jagged sword and a fan blade, and could summon a giant \\"land shark\\" mecha. On some occasions, he would use monsters that are Phantom Beast-themed. He first comes to Earth hunting Skyla, a Carminian who can give her powers to someone when she dies. He fails in his attempt to capture these powers, and ends up stranded when his ship is shot down after being defeated by Shane Clarke with his Red Wind Battlizer. Vexacus becomes Lothor's head general, and often clashes with Zurgane. An alternate dimension that Goldwinger sends Tori to on Vexacus' orders had that dimension's Vexacus as a good guy. He is among those who help Lothor fight the evil Ninja Rangers. Vexacus' feud with Zurgane advances to a point where, after Zurgane's Hyper Zurganezord is destroyed, Vexacus kills him – the first part of a plan to destroy all the other generals and take over from Lothor. He later takes out Motodrone and attempts the same with Shimazu,Power Rangers Ninja Storm episode, \\"Down and Dirty\\" while teaming up with Marah and Kapri to take down Lothor. However, the final two-parter revealed he had been deliberately been set up by Lothor to destroy all the generals in order to overload the Abyss of Evil; Marah and Kapri, who had been in on Lothor's plan, arranged for Vexacus' destruction in battle with the Rangers (taking the Thunder Megazord with him). He returns again after the Abyss is opened, but is quickly defeated and destroyed by Shane. Vexacus is voiced by Michael Hurst. Shimazu Shimazu is a statue that contains the reincarnation of an evil clown/peafowl-like Japanese warlord legend. He was brought to life accidentally during a battle between Cam, the Green Samurai Ranger, and Motodrone, due to Motodrone's reanimated energy. He joined Lothor's army (where Lothor gave Shimazu the power of speech) and unleashed three creatures called Wolfblades. Though the Rangers defeated him, he remained a part of Lothor's army for the remainder of the series. There was a rare occasion if he were to be seen with a body part-inspired monster. An alternate dimension that Goldwinger sent Tori to had Shimazu as a good guy. He is among those who help Mayor Lothor fight the evil Ninja Rangers. Shimazu, along with Vexacus, plotted to take control of Lothor's ship, but he was eventually betrayed. He later teamed up with Marah and Kapri, who at the time seemed to be masterminds, having concealed their genius. They used him to try to destroy the Rangers in their Zords. However, after the Zords were destroyed by the Rangers, Marah and Kapri destroyed him, having been working for Lothor throughout. Shimazu returned from the Abyss of Evil in the finale episode, and was quickly defeated again by the Red Wind Ranger (although it wasn't revealed if he was completely destroyed). Shimazu is voiced by Jeremy Birchall. =Marah and Kapri= Marah and Kapri are sisters and the nieces of Lothor by marriage. Exactly who Lothor marries to gain this relation is never made clear. All is known is that their parents allowed them to stay with Lothor during his quest for power. Though they are both stereotypically foolish, Marah (who has black hair and bug-looking headress) is rather more ditzy than Kapri. Kapri (who has pink hair), on the other hand, is meaner and more scornful (especially of Marah). Marah and Kapri constantly tried to prove to their uncle that they were evil enough to be in his army, and frequently showed each other up and the other generals in order to do so. Most often, Lothor considered them pests at best. Kapri used Lothor's PAM (Personal Alien Manager) to summon monstrous warriors from across the galaxy, and also to increase them to massive size with the Scroll of Empowerment. On one occasion, Marah was apparently kicked out of Lothor's army when her old friend Beevil upstaged her. Miserable, she gained the trust of Dustin Brooks, the Yellow Wind Ranger, to defeat Beevil. In the end, however, it was revealed to be part of a deception to make Beevil more powerful. Beevil was destroyed, but Lothor and the other villains nonetheless congratulated Marah for betraying Dustin. Marah appeared to be regretful of it, though she claimed she was indeed evil. An alternate dimension that Goldwinger sent Tori to had that dimension's Marah and Kapri working as hippies. They even help Mayor Lothor fight the evil Ninja Rangers. After the Ninja Rangers were defeated and made to renounce their evil ways, Marah and Kapri suggested to Tori to return to her dimension the same way that she came into their dimension. Towards the end of the series, Marah and Kapri appeared to have hidden depths when they apparently arranged for Lothor's generals to overthrow him. It appeared that they were masterminds, merely hiding behind their ignorance, but this was soon revealed to be a ploy by Lothor himself. He was using them to destroy all of his own generals, and add their power to the Abyss of Evil, which would overflow and destroy the world. When their usefulness was at its end, though, Lothor betrayed them too and left them aboard the Dark Ship as it was about to explode. This led to them helping to free the captive Ninja Students and paved the way for their redemption. When they begin training at the Wind Ninja Academy, Marah was seen in a ninja suit with an orange stripe (presumably meaning fire) and Kapri in a similar one with a pink stripe (presumably meaning ice). In Power Rangers Dino Thunder, though shocked by Lothor's return, Marah and Kapri tricked him into letting them rejoin his cause. They show their true colors in helping free both Sensei Watanabe and the Ninja Students. Both Kapri and Marah share a bonding moment with Cam, while Lothor watches on in disgust after realizing he had been duped. This leads to him and Mesogog to fight against one another. Kapri's powers include teleportation, clothes transformation, energy projection, martial arts skils and shielding. She can project ice frost, control her sword while attacking her enemies, and can blow her enemies away with her breath. Marah's powers consist of energy projection, combat techniques, shielding, flight, clothes transformation, and weapon-hand extension, martial arts skills and teleportation. Marah is portrayed by Katrina Devine while Kapri is portrayed by Katrina Browne. =Kelzaks= The Kelzaks are Lothor's foot soldiers. They have black bodies, black pony-tails and red Serpent-faces. They normally domesticate swords and clubs as weapons. In \\"The Wild Wipeout,\\" the Kelzaks are shown to be co-existing with humans alongside the known monsters up to this episode. Some Kelzaks help Mayor Lothor and his allies fight the Evil Ninja Rangers. Kelzak Furies The Kelzak Furies resemble the Kelzaks, but they have red bodies and are more powerful and harder to beat. =Evil Ninja Rangers= When Tori got teleported to an alternate dimension by Goldwinger in \\"The Wild Wipeout\\", she discovered that the counterparts of her fellow Rangers (yet they don't have their version of Tori for some unknown reason) and Sensei Kanoi are evil while the counterparts from Lothor (who was the Mayor of Blue Bay Harbor), his nieces and generals, the Kelzaks, and the monsters up to this episode were good where they were interacting with Blue Bay Harbor's citizens. After being unable to get Mayor Lothor to help deal with the evil Ninja Rangers, Tori tried to fight them only to be overwhelmed. With Tori receiving the last minute help of Mayor Lothor and his allies, the evil Ninja Rangers were defeated and forced to renounce their evil ways. =Monsters= These are the monsters used by Lothor and his minions. The monsters are adapted from the monsters that appeared in Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger. To make a monster grow, Lothor would have the Scroll of Empowerment descend to Earth and emit energy that would enlarge the monster. When a monster is defeated, they end up in the Abyss of Evil. * Blue Face (voiced by Craig Parker) – A mantis monster.

His book, The War and the Gospel (French original 1953) made him internationally known.Dave D'Albert, A Lexicon of Spiritual Leaders In the IFOR Peace Movement (2010) http://www.ifor.org/resources/Spiritual_Leaders_IFOR_V3_P1.pdf Origin Lasserre's father, Henri Lasserre (born 4 July 1875 in Geneva, Switzerland, died 26 May 1945 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was, by nationality Swiss. His family came as Huguenots from Pont de Camarès (France) and emigrated to Switzerland in 1749. Early in his life, Henri Lasserre was interested in Tolstoy and life in communities and later immigrated to Canada. Jean Lasserre dedicated his book War and the Gospel to the memory of his father. His mother, Marie Schnurr (born 12 January 1878 in Lyon, France, died 19 February 1960 in Lyon) was an artist and botanist. After the divorce of his parents in 1909 Jean Lasserre lived in Lyon. In 1930, he became a French citizen.Dave D'Albert, A Lexicon of Spiritual Leaders In the IFOR Peace Movement (2010) http://www.ifor.org/resources/Spiritual_Leaders_IFOR_V3_P1.pdf Studies and encounter with Dietrich Bonhoeffer From 1926 to 1930 Jean Lasserre studied theology in Paris and from September 1930 to 1931, Lasserre was a seminarian at Union Theological Seminary in New York. There he met two other European scholars, Erwin Sutz and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Despite the inter-War tensions between France and Germany, Bonhoeffer and Lasserre became friends. Following the academic year Jean Lasserre and Dietrich Bonhoeffer traveled around the United States and Mexico.Dr. F. Burton Nelson, \\"Friends He Met in America Three colleagues from Union Theological Seminary who deeply influenced Bonhoeffer\\" Christianity Today, 10/01/1991 http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1991/issue32/3236.html In the following years, there were various reunions: 1931 at an ecumenical conference in Cambridge, in 1932 in Les Houches in the valley of Chamonix, 1934 at the World Youth Conference of the World Association for Friendship through the Churches and in the same year in Bruay en-Artois. Eventually, Lasserre was only able to correspond with Dietrich Bonhoeffer via letter until he was arrested in April 1943. Jean Lasserre burned their letters during the German occupation of France out of concern for his family and himself.Dr. F.

S.P.D. Rangers The S.P.D. Power Rangers are characters and heroes in the Power Rangers universe, and the primary protagonists in the television series Power Rangers S.P.D.. This series is set in the year 2025. The S.P.D. Rangers that appear in the series are labeled B-Squad, a weak team that are initially a backup team as their name suggests. They are promoted to the Earth's primary line of defense and granted Ranger status after the A-Squad vanishes, as well acting as tutors for the D-Squad Cadets. They are an integral part of the Space Patrol Delta organization. =Jack Landors= Jack Landors (played by Brandon Jay McLaren) is the S.P.D. Red Ranger. A former wanted thief alongside his best friend Z, Jack volunteered to become the Red B-Squad Ranger in order to save Z's life as well as those of the other Rangers and took over as team leader, to the ire of Sky Tate. At first, he barely did his position as team leader in a strong way, but has since proven he is a very capable leader, albeit one who often clashes with the chain of command as well as bend the rules sometimes (giving Sky a head start to deal with a former partner by \\"reciting\\" a regulation when he's not allowed to pursue on his own). He formed a slightly uneasy but respect- based relationship with Sky, taking tactical suggestions from him in the field and helping him deal with his issues regarding Mirloc and his father. After his encounter with the volunteer Ally, he realized that, while he liked being a Ranger, what he really wanted to do was go back to helping people on the streets - the conflict of these two interests led to him nearly botching the mission against Delex. Following the destruction of the Magnificence and the containment of Gruumm, Jack left S.P.D. to work with Ally full-time and Sky took his place. Despite his casual attitude, he loathes having to say goodbye and left S.P.D. without telling the rest of B-Squad; despite this, they remain close. It is possible that he rejoined his teammates during Power Rangers Super Megaforce, as all five B-Squad Ranger powers were employed during the final battle with the Armada. While unmorphed, his genetic power enables him to become intangible and pass through any object. As the Red Ranger, he has exclusive access to a Battlizer and also control over two separate Zords and S.W.A.T. Mode. He wields the Delta Blasters and is an impressive sharpshooter. His uniform sports the number 1. Jack doesn't know when he was born. Syd, however, offered to share her birthday with him. =Schuyler \\"Sky\\" Tate= Schuyler \\"Sky\\" Tate (portrayed by Chris VioletteAaron Wallace, \\"Review of Power Rangers S.P.D.: Volume 1 - Joining Forces,\\" UltimateDisney.com (June 13, 2005).) is the S.P.D. Blue Ranger and second-in-command who was originally a stickler for rules. Sky is top on B-Squad on weapons and fighting, and believes he should be the Red Ranger just like his father was. Unfortunately, his pride, and lack of faith in his friends/ teammates, citing such reasons as Syd is a girl, causing him to fail a test of character, and as a result Commander Cruger picks him to be the Blue Ranger. When Sky faces off against Mirloc, the one responsible for the death of his father, Jack thinks Sky should be the one to bring him in as the Red Ranger. Although it was an honor to be the Red Ranger, Sky realized that heroes come in all colors. After going through extensive S.W.A.T. training on Zantor to acquire S.W.A.T. Mode, he discovers the importance of his team. With teamwork, they are able to even defeat the corrupt A-Squad. Over time, he learns the values of following rather than leading, and when put in a temporary leading position, impresses even Cruger with the skills he learned during their battles. With Jack leaving S.P.D., Sky has grown into a great leader and has learned to accept his teammates as equals. Cruger chooses him to step up as the new Red Ranger. When Cruger becomes Supreme Commander, Sky replaces Cruger and is promoted to Earth Commander and Bridge replaced Sky as the S.P.D. Red Ranger. This may also mean Sky is the new Shadow Ranger, which would make his number 100, or has a Ranger identification similar to that of the Shadow Ranger. He may have reassumed his Blue Ranger powers to join the Ranger army in Super Megaforce. While unmorphed, his genetic power allows him to create force fields. =Bridge Carson= Bridge Carson (portrayed by Matt Austin) is the S.P.D. Green Ranger. Bridge might appear slow at times, but he is a computer genius, a master mechanic, and much more. He might be gullible, but he also has a heart of gold. People underestimate Bridge, but he always manages to come through with his quick-thinking. He is well known for his love of \\"buttery\\" toast, and one of his more amusing behaviors is an apparent inability to say the word \\"buttery\\" without wiggling his fingers in front of his mouth. The phrase \\"buttery\\" was first mentioned by him when offering toast to the Yellow S.P.D. Ranger, Z, who formed a firm friendship with him; as evidenced when she defended him, when Sky blamed Syd's confusion and Bridge's ramblings. While thinking, he will sometimes do a handstand to help him think, or so he says. He is also Jewish since in \\"Walls\\" he tells Jack that he celebrates Hanukkah when Jack says that Christmas has come early upon Bridge and him receiving new patrol bikes. Bridge takes it upon himself to over-analyze any situation and sometimes lacks confidence. Bridge endures S.W.A.T. training on Zantor with the others to achieve S.W.A.T. Mode. Bridge relies more on intuition than any other Ranger and is the first one to sense that something is wrong with A-Squad. As time goes on, the other Rangers come to respect how he always comes through for them and he becomes more confident. While unmorphed, his genetic power gives him a form of psychometry and the ability to scan and read auras and energy signatures. He has no control over this ability, and consequently wears gloves most of the time. As the series progressed, Bridge's power evolved to include tracking thoughts, since, as he stated, thoughts are energy. After Jack left S.P.D., and once Sky was promoted to Red Ranger, Bridge was promoted to Blue Ranger. After Commander Cruger is promoted, Sky is promoted as well, leaving Bridge as the Red Ranger. He was later called upon to join veteran Rangers Adam Park, Tori Hanson, Kira Ford, and Xander Bly in battling alongside the Operation Overdrive Rangers against the villainous alliance led by Thrax. He may also have become the Green Ranger again with his predecessors reclaiming their Red and Blue powers for the final battle with the Armada in Super Megaforce. His assigned S.P.D. number is 3; he is later promoted to 2 and eventually to 1. =Elizabeth \\"Z\\" Delgado= Elizabeth \\"Z\\" Delgado (played by Monica May) is the S.P.D. Yellow Ranger. When Z was younger, she was considered an outcast at school due to her genetic power. She ran away and upon being attacked by a vicious monster, she was saved by a disguised Anubis Cruger. Eventually, she began living on the streets. It was there that she met her best friend Jack and began stealing. She eventually grew tired of that profession and wished to be part of something bigger, which led to her being drafted into the S.P.D. B-Squad. Despite their differing personalities, she formed a firm friendship with both Bridge and Syd, often teaming up with the Pink Ranger in battle. She defended her when Sky blamed Syd's confusion and Bridge's ramblings. Easy-going and somewhat sloppy, she is a viciously determined fighter and, due to her past alienation, took it upon herself to reach out to young Sam. Her genetic power of duplication allows her to become a virtual one-Ranger army in the blink of an eye. Z has the power to make several copies of herself when needed. She has a long history with Piggy and appears to trust him as a friend, often going to him for underworld information or help even when his duplicitous nature was obvious. When he was revealed to be openly working for Gruumm, Z was shocked that he could have betrayed them. Through S.W.A.T. training on Zantor, Z learns to get over her differences with Syd and together as a team, the Rangers take down a corrupted A-Squad. When Jack leaves S.P.D., Z stays with the Rangers and continues to live out her dream of protecting the innocent. She and her teammates later appeared as part of the Ranger army in Super Megaforce. Her assigned S.P.D. number is 4, and she is never shown to have been promoted after Sky becomes Red. She is good at tap dancing and jazz dancing. =Sydney \\"Syd\\" Drew= Sydney \\"Syd\\" Drew (portrayed by Alycia Purrott) is the S.P.D. Pink Ranger. Her parents worked at S.P.D. and were involved with the creation of the Delta Morphers, which altered Syd's DNA, giving her her genetic ability. Her family is very wealthy. She was on the B-Squad along with Sky Tate and Bridge Carson. Her life before S.P.D. is not clear. Multiple references during the show imply that she has many talents, including being an excellent fencer, pop star, and model. Despite her flagrant vanity and occasional selfishness, she is very caring and compassionate, and is often the first to stand up for someone when they are being treated wrong. Though she and Z are constantly fighting, deep down they care for each other and very frequently team up in battle. When unmorphed, her genetic ability allows her to change her hand into any material she needs. Syd and her teammates later took part in the Megaforce Rangers' final battle with the Armada. =Sam= Sam (played by Brett Stewart and voiced by Yuri Lowenthal in the Power Rangers: Super Legends video game) was once a very lonely and misunderstood street orphan whose mother died in a tragic incident and whose genetic powers (of being able to teleport objects) made him a constant target for bullies. His desperate search for friends led him to be manipulated by Mora and her newest creation Bugglesworth, who turned people into dolls for Mora to collect. While the other Rangers were quick to judge Sam poorly, Z realized that Sam was not evil and just wanted to fit in. Although it took a lot of convincing, Sam eventually agreed to stay with his new friend and the other Rangers at the S.P.D. Academy. In the year 2040, Sam was chosen by S.P.D. to become the Omega Ranger and charged with a special mission: travelling back through time to 2025 to stop the rogue Morgana from destroying the Rangers and eventually Earth, thus preventing the disaster that has befallen his world. He destroyed Shorty upon the start of the deciding battle and drove off Morgana and Devastation however he refused help believing the Rangers of this time too outdated to help him. He later learned he was wrong when the other Rangers rushed to his aid when he was in trouble and together they saved the future by riding the Delta Squad Megazord on the back of the Omegamax Cycle and blasting Devastation's robot until it was destroyed and then capturing him. This battle taught him the value of teamwork. However, passing through the time warp heavily altered his human form, reducing him to a floating orb of pure energy. Due to this setback, his only remotely human form is his Ranger form. As Kat searched for a way to send him back to the future, he assisted the B-Squad Rangers in their battle to save Earth. Omega joined the B-Squad to prevent Emperor Gruumm's invasion and brought with him a powerful array of futuristic equipment including the Uniforce Cycle, a Zord known as the Omegamax Cycle, and an Omega Morpher that - in addition to increasing his strength (Muscle Mode), allowed him to perform various feats including temporal manipulation (Hyper Mode), fire bursts of electricity from his palm (Electro Mode), and an ultimate finisher attack of shining energy (Lightbeam Mode). Like the S.P.D. and Patrol morphers, the Omega Morpher can also grant access to the Judgement Mode function. His suit brandishes the Roman Numeral for six, \\"VI\\". When some friends of Piggy stole the S.W.A.T. technology, Sam's technological advancements were outmatched, but, as he is \\"the force from the future\\", he was always at the Rangers disposal when they needed him. During the final battle against Gruumm, Sam's old friend Nova Ranger came looking for him. After the battle ended, the two of them returned to the future. Presumably she was able to return him to human form as he unmorphed for a moment before traveling back to the future. He apparently joined his teammates in traveling to the past in Super Megaforce to battle the Warstar Armada alongside other past Rangers. It's later stated, the directors regretted cutting corners and not having Sam in his human form in the season instead of a floating ball. =Anubis \\"Doggie\\" Cruger= Anubis \\"Doggie\\" Cruger is a member of the dog-like Sirian race from the planet Sirius, and was a member of the original Space Patrol Delta, training in the Academy alongside future criminal Icthior. He led the SPD forces against the Troobian Empire's invasion, fighting and scarring Emperor Gruumm by shearing off his right horn, before General Benagg kidnapped his wife Isinia and managed to bring down Cruger from behind. The battle was lost and all the Sirians except for Cruger and Isinia were killed. After that, Anubis made a vow to never fight again and left for Earth, thinking his wife was lost. On Earth, Anubis founded the S.P.D. Earth Academy and trained the elite S.P.D. Ranger squads. He sends the A-Squad Rangers to the Helix Nebula to fight at the front line against Grumm, not realising this was a trap by Gruumm to take out Earth's front line of defense. When he hears that Gruumm is on his way to Earth and could not contact the A-Squad, he promotes the B-Squad Rangers to active status and gives Schyler \\"Sky\\" Tate, Bridge Carson, and Sydney \\"Syd\\" Drew a set of S.P.D. Morphers. They were soon rejoined by Elizabeth \\"Z\\" Delgado, and Jack Landors, Cruger is portrayed as a good judge of character. He gives both Jack Landors and Elizabeth Delgado, two criminals, a chance at redemption by making them Rangers, and sees the potential in Boom when he drops out of the Academy. Anubis will go to any lengths to protect those he values and loves; for example, when Dr. Manx was abducted by General Benaag, he broke his own vow of peace and became the Shadow Ranger (suit number 100). He is armed with his Patrol Morpher (his morphing call of \\"S.P.D. Emergency!\\" is the same as the other S.P.D. Rangers, but his morpher is different, as the normally white SPD text is black), the Shadow Saber, and the Delta Command Megazord (in reality, the S.P.D. Base). As the Shadow Ranger, he has proved to be a great asset to the B-Squad Rangers. He takes a very hardline approach to discipline and training, once deliberately letting the Rangers see he was watching them being defeated and not intervening in order to make them stop relying on Shadow Ranger to solve their battles for them. Sometimes he can go too far, at which point Kat will argue against him. Cruger is not fond of his superior officer, Supreme Commander Fowler Birdy. He demonstrates this in his referring to Birdy as \\"that overstuffed pelican\\". The two do not have similar strategic styles, and this temporarily resulted in Cruger being dismissed and relieved of command duty. However, Birdy changed his tune forever when the Shadow Ranger showed up to save him from Gruumm. Cruger did possess a high level of respect for previous Power Rangers, expressing particular pleasure at working with Tommy Oliver when their two teams worked together against a time-traveling Gruumm and Zeltrax. Cruger erased the memories of most of the Dino Rangers to prevent contamination of history, but-agreeing with his Rangers that it wasn't fair that only the Dino Rangers should forget their encounter-he then erased B-Squad's memories and his own before they returned to the future. Although he believed that his wife was dead since the Battle of Sirius, an encounter with his old enemy General Benaag cast doubt on that belief. When Cruger used his Morpher/judgement scanner for abducting his wife, the morpher \\"acquitted\\" Benaag. Later, when his old rival-turned enemy Icthior claimed that Isinia Cruger was still alive, Cruger wasn't sure what to believe. He never told the B-Squad about his marriage to Isinia or about her in general—keeping his painful secret from everyone but Kat. The question was answered after he was taken captive by A-Squad. He saw her being held captive onboard Gruumm's spacecraft. Also when the A-Squad returned he started to ignore B-Squad and they thought that he was just demoting them on purpose and was going to ignore them again although he presumably did this because of procedure. Dr. Kat Manx admitted to the B-Squad when they went to fight the A-Squad that he told her that they were the best squad that he ever had the pleasure of working with showing them just how highly he really thought of them. After B-Squad was thrown into captivity along with Cruger, they all escaped with Piggy's help. B-Squad returned to Earth while Cruger morphed and engaged Gruumm in battle card-capturing Mora along the way. Cruger came out the winner and rescued Isinia while Grumm apparently fell to his death, but he had one more task to complete. Cruger was tasked with opening an access panel in the left arm of the Magnificence, which would allow the S.W.A.T. Megazord to destroy it with a maxed-out laser blast. He did, and the Megazord fired, causing the Magnificence to implode, destroying Omni and saving Earth and the universe. Cruger was thought dead, but he and Isinia survived. This discovery overjoyed the Rangers. Gruumm survived as well, and engaged Cruger (who was unmorphed) one last time, only to lose his left horn and be contained. Following the battle, he promoted B-Squad to A-level, only to have them refuse because ultimately, they were the B Squad, the team that had come through their trials together. Cruger made Squad B be the highest Ranger level at S.P.D. on the spot, saying then that there would be no A-Squad. He also promoted Sky to Red Ranger status, and Bridge to Blue Ranger status following the departure of Jack. There was no mention of a new Green S.P.D. Ranger. In the first half of the two-part Operation Overdrive episode \\"Once a Ranger\\", it is revealed that an unknown amount of time after the finale of S.P.D., Cruger is promoted to Supreme Commander when Fowler Birdy retires, bringing about the subsequent promotions of Sky Tate to Commander of S.P.D. Earth, and Bridge Carson to B-Squad's leader as the Red Ranger. It is unknown if he kept his Shadow Ranger powers, or if he passed them down to Sky when Sky was promoted to his old position. The Shadow Ranger was also not among the veteran Rangers who appeared in Super Megaforce. Cruger is performed by John Tui (who later portrayed as Daggeron in Power Rangers Mystic Force) and voiced by Darryl Kurylo in the Power Rangers: Super Legends video game. =Dr. Katherine \\"Kat\\" Manx= Dr. Katherine \\"Kat\\" Manx (played by Michelle Langstone) is the technical expert for Earth's S.P.D.(Space Patrol Delta), a master of many sciences, and the S.P.D. Kat Ranger. She is a humanoid cat-like alien of an unknown world. Despite her youthful appearance, Kat is 147 Earth years old. Kat serves as the chief technologist in S.P.D. and was responsible for the invention of all of Earth's S.P.D. technology, from the Judgment Scanner to the Delta Command Megazord. During all S.P.D. missions, she can be found in the Command Center running ops and providing scientific assistance to the Rangers. Kat was part of the early days of Earth's SPD branch, when it was a top-secret organisation in 2001, the same year that the Time Force season was set during. She was one of several scientists, along with the B-Squad's parents, who worked with highly energized chemicals that led to the B-Squad's mutations. Kat is also a good friend to Commander Cruger, though she considers him a \\"stubborn old dog\\", and provides a reasoned argument against his more emotional decision. When General Benaag captured her, Cruger accepted the Patrol Morpher that she had given him and became the Shadow Ranger (Producer Greg Aronowitz has stated in a podcast interview that Kat was in love with Cruger and vice versa, but that he never acted on it; the comment comes 16 minutes into the interview). Kat serves as a mentor to Boom, a reject from the academy. Despite his apparent ineptitude, her teaching turned him into a technical expert. Although Kat is a scientist by trade, she is capable of fighting when called upon. Her cat-like physiology makes her exceptionally agile, and she is a skilled fighter. She led the defense of the Space Patrol Delta Base against the final Troobian invasion. In \\"Katastrophe\\", Kat was granted the use of her own (temporary) Delta Morpher (given to her by Commander Birdy) to become the S.P.D. Kat Ranger. The Kat Ranger costume is half-orange and half-white with cat-like ears, making her the first 8th Ranger, and the first Ranger to share the same first name with a previous Ranger, Katherine Hillard. The Kat Ranger also marks the first time that a Power Rangers team has had three female rangers on one team. Her powers expired after an hour. Her costume was similar to those of the B-Squad, but she did not have a number on her Ranger form like the other members of S.P.D. Instead, she had a heptagon as her chest symbol. As Kat Ranger, she created blinding auroras and threw feather-like \\"Cat Stunners\\". She wanted desperately to help out against an enemy called Mooney who was a former classmate of hers and was given the Morpher to fight. She captures Mooney herself after stopping his giant robot. In Endings Part 1 she was amongst those captured by Broodwing's forces and was put into a cell alongside Boom. After Boom gets them out by summoning RIC she disables the Delta Command Megazord stopping Broodwing and allowing the B-Squad to capture him. In Endings Part 2 she fights in the final battle with Grumm's forces and retreats inside when the Nova Ranger shows up. She also witnesses the final showdown between Grumm and Cruger. =Nova Ranger= Nova Ranger is a fictional character in the TV series Power Rangers S.P.D. She is voiced by Antonia Prebble while her human form was portrayed by an uncredited actress. Her numeric S.P.D. insignia is 7, where the Roman numeral VII is rearranged stylistically as IVI. During the final battle with Gruumm, the B-Squad Rangers had left the S.P.D. base relatively unguarded, save for Dr. Kat Manx, Boom, the Omega Ranger, and the S.P.D. cadets. Grumm's forces were overpowering the S.P.D. forces, when a time-portal suddenly appeared, and a silver-colored Ranger stepped out. She identified herself as the S.P.D. Nova Ranger. Nova Ranger had been Omega Ranger's ally in the future, and had been searching various timelines in her effort to locate him. With her help, the S.P.D. base was protected from harm. A second time portal was opened after the battle ended and the unmorphed Nova Ranger, along with the unmorphed and now-fully-human Omega Ranger, returned to the future. Nova Ranger had a blue-and-gold device identical in appearance to the Omega Ranger's Morpher, except for the colour scheme, which was called the Nova Morpher. Like the Omega Morpher, Nova Ranger's morpher acted as her only weapon in combat and had an Electro-Mode. However, unlike the Omega Morpher, the Nova Morpher appeared to have better time traveling capabilities and the power to restore Omega Ranger to human form. Allies of the Power Rangers=S.P.D.= Short for Space Patrol Delta, S.P.D. is an interplanetary police force that oversees law in the different areas of outer space. S.P.D. maintains the peace where they train and deploy their own teams of Power Rangers, who are equipped with the latest technology. Supreme Commander Fowler Birdy Fowler Birdy (portrayed by Paul Norell) is the bird-like Supreme Commander of S.P.D. and Commander Cruger's superior. However, the two do not get along at all, as indicated by Cruger referring to Birdy as an \\"over-stuffed pelican.\\" Arrogant and supremely blunt, he does not tolerate insubordination and views Gruumm's victory on Sirius as an embarrassment.Power Rangers episode \\"Dismissed\\": \\"Patience? You were 'patient' on Sirius.\\" When Birdy came to Earth to inspect S.P.D.'s Earth headquarters, his style of tactics clashed with Cruger's (which was to keep the Rangers as a team because that's how he thought they worked best). This led to Cruger's brief expulsion from S.P.D., during which Birdy took command of the Delta Base. After foolishly splitting up the Ranger team, he went out personally to fight Emperor Gruumm and was quickly overwhelmed by Gruumm's superior skill. Luckily, Shadow Ranger, acting against orders, showed up on his ATV and drove Gruumm off. Fowler was at first enraged, but changed his tune after Cruger drew a salute from his fellow Rangers. Birdy departed, commending Cruger for his actions and telling him that the galaxy is depending on him. Birdy appeared again when Morgana launched her all out attack on the Power Rangers. Birdy told them that Galactic Command is now aware of their plight and that they couldn't respond on such short notice. Birdy told them that even if they did, they'd fear that they might fall into Gruumm's trap. Birdy concludes that they were on their own for this one and wishes them good luck. He later appeared to promote Dr. Manx (which she later refused) to a position at Galaxy Command, and when she wanted to stop Mooney, he gave her the Kat Morpher to go into battle herself. In the final S.P.D. episode Endings Pt. 2, Fowler Birdy, Sergeant Silverback, and some unnamed S.P.D. officials (consisting of an unnamed lion-like alien, an unnamed octopus-headed alien, an unnamed red ape- like alien, and an unnamed exotic bird-like alien) were among the S.P.D. reinforcements to assist in the final battle against the Troobians, apparently having decided to go into battle himself. In the Operation Overdrive team-up story Once a Ranger, Bridge reveals that at some point after the finale of S.P.D., Birdy retired from his position (and moved to Miami). Cruger was promoted to his position as Supreme Commander, so Sky then was promoted as the Shadow Ranger and as the Commander of S.P.D. Earth, and Bridge was promoted as the Red S.P.D. Ranger. Sergeant Silverback Sergeant Silverback (performed by John Tui) is an S.P.D. training instructor based on the planet Zentor who looks like an alien gorilla. He is a (rather odd) friend of Anubis Cruger, who sends B-Squad to him following their lack of teamwork. Silverback put them through their paces, training them and strengthening the bonds of friendship between them. After receiving his approval, he sent a communication to Cruger only to learn that he was in trouble. Dismissing B-Squad once and for all from Zentor, he gave them the S.P.D. S.W.A.T. Truck, allowing them access to S.W.A.T. mode. Sergeant Silverback's only companion is an older model S.P.D. canine robot reminiscent of R.I.C. It seems to be modeled after a bulldog. He speaks as a stereotypical military officer (reminiscent of military actor R. Lee Ermey). In Endings, Part 2 he was among several reinforcements to help S.P.D. in their final battle against the Troobians. He also brought his R.I.C. with him, and another S.W.A.T. truck to assist in the battle. Boom Boom (portrayed by Kelson Henderson) is the lab assistant of Kat Manx, and is always willing to test out her latest inventions. Boom attended S.P.D. academy, but washed out due to not having the right stuff. However, he was of interest to Cruger, who convinced Kat to let him serve as her assistant.Power Rangers episode \\"Beginnings Part 2\\" Boom never told his parents about washing out. He managed to convince them that he was the \\"Orange Ranger\\", which came back to haunt him when they came to visit. He was forced to don a mock-up costume and team up with the B-Squad, putting the true Rangers in trouble. He then returned to what he knew best, and finally told his parents about his real job: a lab assistant for Kat's inventions. During the two-part finale Endings, Boom plays a somewhat vital role. By summoning R.I.C. in Part 1, Boom is able to free himself and Kat in time to shut down the Delta Command Megazord and stop its attack on the Rangers. In Part 2, Boom gives a rousing speech to the SPD cadets that gets them to fight the Troobian invasion when the Rangers are unavailable. Boom fights briefly in the battle, but retreats inside with Kat when reinforcements later arrive. S.O.P.H.I.E. Short for Series One Processor Hyper Intelligent Ecryptor, S.O.P.H.I.E. (portrayed by Natacha Hutchison) is a computer programmer and cyborg. She enrolled at S.P.D. to use her skills for good, hiding her cyborg origins (as cyborgs are highly prejudiced against). When the S.P.D. Rangers discovered her secret, she was unfairly expelled from the academy and pursued by Valko. After escaping from him (with the help of Cruger who heard her cry for help and as the Shadow Ranger card-captured him), she returned to S.P.D. and helped activate the Delta Command Megazord. Realizing that she meant no harm and what an asset she could be to S.P.D., she was given a job as a programmer at the Theta Quadrant. D-Squad The lowest- ranking squad, this squad consists of cadets who trained for eventual promotion to active status as C-Squad and up. They are trained and advised by the B-Squad. The D-Squad consists of S.O.P.H.I.E., 3 Caucasian Males, and an Asian Female. =Piggy= Piggy (portrayed by Barnie Duncan) is a bird-faced informant who works for whoever pays him the best, or threatens him for it (including SPD, Emperor Gruumm, and/or Broodwing). He spends much of his life on Earth as a homeless bum, eating garbage and developing connections with the underworld. He has a form of friendship with Z who has multiple times been shown to trust Piggy more than anyone else does - trusting him to guard the proton accelerator in \\"Beginnings\\", taking Kat to get a quantum enhancer from him in \\"S.W.A.T.\\" and appealing to his better nature (and thanking him) when Bridge was in danger in \\"Missing\\". Unknown to most, however, he was in contact with Emperor Gruumm, who he appeared to serve directly, and was personally responsible for handing Gruumm the technology he needed to reach Earth. In \\"Shadow\\", Piggy wins the lottery and opened his own trailer cafe that brings in lowlife patrons from many different planets. While Piggy otherwise lives a very comfortable life, when the Rangers show up at his cafe, his customers flee, which irritates Piggy to no end; to his customers, S.P.D. are the monsters to fear. His frequent jesting comments towards Syd make some believe that he had a minor crush on her. He quickly finds himself caught between aiding either S.P.D., Gruumm, or Broodwing multiple times, such as stealing S.W.A.T. technology for both villains, and several times giving advice & information to the Rangers, contacting Gruumm/Broodwing to tell him about the Rangers being on their way, and then contact Broodwing/Gruumm to tell them about the other's plot! Both Broodwing and Gruumm saw Piggy as being key to their plans because of this. In Endings, he ended up leading the B-Squad into a trap where they were captured by Emperor Gruumm, much to Z's shock. When Piggy asked if he did the right thing, a lightning bolt destroyed his cafe and, taking the hint, Piggy sneaked onto Gruumm's ship disguised as a Krybot and freed them returning to Earth with them on the SWAT Flyers. He participated in the final battle against the Troobians and, afterward, joined Jack and Ally in their business of giving clothes to the homeless. Also Jack gave him credit for what he did saying none of them would be there (in front of SPD after the battle was over) if it hadn't been for him. He makes a cameo in the Power Rangers Mystic Force episode \\"Ranger Down\\", because his actor was available since he also played Toby. He reveals that he just came from another galaxy, establishing himself at least 19 years before anyone else arrived on Earth. When the cat genie Jenji stumbles upon the same alley Piggy is in, Piggy (after discouraging Jenji from a life of crime) predicts much of SPD that he explains that his dream is: \\"to win the lottery and open a restaurant... with wheels, called \\"Piggy's\\", and says \\"in 20 years this place will be crawling with aliens...\\". =Ally Samuels= Ally Samuels (played by Beth Allen) is the daughter of the Samuel Clothings owner. She first appears in \\"Resurrection\\" where Jack mistakes her for robbing a truck only to learn that she is unloading the truck's contents for Samuel Clothings (which helps out the city's less fortunate). Jack later apologizes to her for the misunderstanding and she was able to forgive him. In \\"Endings,\\" Jack resigned from S.P.D. and joined Piggy into helping Ally and the other workers of Samuel Clothings, because he wanted to be part of something bigger than himself, despite having been doing that already. Troobian Empire The Troobian Empire is a galactic empire and warlike army in the service of Emperor Gruumm. The term Troobian refers to any being that serves under Gruumm (as stated by Bruce Kalish). Gruumm's forces travel in the Terror Spacecraft that they use to travel throughout outer space in its journey to conquer and destroy planets. Inside, everything is green, dank, and skeletal. Information about them can be found below. =Omni= Omni (voiced by Geoff Dolan) is secretly the power behind the throne and de facto leader of the Troobians. He is a giant brain housed in a tank in a room on Gruumm's spacecraft. He has a single eye on a tentacle-like appendage. He was mentioned on a few occasions throughout in the season, but was finally revealed at the end of the episode Insomnia, making Mora pledge her allegiance to it. In Endings, Part 1, he not only \\"spoke\\" for the first time (berating Gruumm over his petty feud with Cruger), but his name was revealed. Omni's reason for attacking Earth was to drain its resources for a weapon in development that he refers to as The Magnificence, a colossal biomechanical body for himself that Gruumm created with the stolen resources. Once the Terror Spacecraft locked in, Omni was connected to his body and used it to fight the S.W.A.T. Megazord, having the upper hand until Doggie Cruger opened an access panel from the inside, allowing the Megazord to deliver a maxed-out laser blast, causing the Magnificence to implode and taking Omni with it. Omni possesses psychic powers and is able to both talk to & harm Gruumm from a distance, as well as brainwash people into serving him. In his Magnificence, he is large enough to hold the Megazord in his hand and wields incredible destructive power. In an interview (9:26 in), Greg Aronowitz stated that \\"Gruumm has always been Omni's puppet... [Gruum] has power, but he has issues and he has weakness, and Omni has taken advantage of that for as long as time can remember.\\" =Emperor Gruumm= Emperor Gruumm (portrayed by Rene Naufahu who would later be cast as Mentor Ji in Power Rangers Samurai) is a figurehead who serves as the de jure leader of the Troobians alien race whose ultimate goal is to conquer other worlds. Gruumm is relentless and nothing will stand in his way to conquer the universe. He previously destroyed the planet Sirius (home world of Commander Anubis \\"Doggie\\" Cruger), and in 2025 he launched an assault on Earth. Gruumm's main strategy is to overwhelm and devastate a planet with constant, large- scale assaults and then drain the planet of its resources, as shown in the flashbacks to the Sirian invasion, and used such tactics on the Helix Nebula simply to draw the A-Squad into an ambush. His highly destructive tactics show life means little to him, and it was initially unclear why he wasn't using such tactics to conquer Earth except on rare occasions, and why he allowed Broodwing to battle the Rangers for him on several occasions. It's briefly shown that his ship can even destroy a planet from orbit. He also was shown repeatedly talking to either himself or an unseen entity whom he referred to as \\"the Magnificence\\". It became clear later on that Gruumm had been working off a long-term plan, intending not to leech and destroy Earth but instead to use its resources - which he looted over the course of the season - to construct a body for Omni, a higher power who he fears and worships. Emperor Gruumm has two aides, Mora (later Morgana) and Broodwing. He has a bitter hatred for Cruger, who cut off his right horn in the battle for Sirius. He is also the most powerful warrior among the Troobian empire, as proved in his victories over the B-Squad Rangers and Supreme Commander Fowler Birdie. His main weapon is a staff that shoots energy, and he also rides a motorcycle with laser cannons. Gruumm has the ability to use telepathy and shapeshift into a selected human form. In battle, he has shown the ability to decimate the Rangers, defeat Commander Birdie and also harm Zeltrax, though Cruger has shown the ability to defeat him. As Omni's master plan came to fruition, Cruger escaped from a cell onboard Gruumm's ship and the two engaged in battle. Although Gruumm was thought to have perished along with the Magnificence, he survived and engaged Cruger (who was unmorphed) one last time, only to get his left horn cut off after being easily defeated. He was then contained. He appears in the Nintendo DS version of Power Rangers: Super Legends as the main villain who has set his sights upon the myth of the Hall of Legends, the resting place of the collected energies of Power Rangers across time. In his twisted mind he envisioned a world where his enemy's power is not only stolen, but used to make him a living god over all creation. =Broodwing= Broodwing (voiced by Jim McLarty) is a three-eyed vampire bat- like alien who is encased in an artificial environment, as demonstrated by the jar on his head. He served as the weapons dealer for the Troobians. He is an emotionless criminal who cares about nothing except money. He supposedly works for Emperor Gruumm, but has been known to work for other aliens as well. He is often forced to play with Mora, much to his displeasure. Broodwing is the source of the rare Orangehead Krybots, as well as providing Gruumm with giant robots for his monsters and Blueheads. Broodwing also has control over a rare race of bats, whose bite can cause beings to grow huge. Shortly after the arrival of Omega Ranger, Gruumm began ordering Broodwing to provide his services while refusing to pay for them. This did not sit well with Broodwing, whose main motivation has always been money, so he began plotting against Gruumm and attempted to conquer Earth first in order to one-up him. For a while, Broodwing was actually behind more attacks on Earth than Gruumm was. One of his assaults involved bringing the Dino Rangers from the past, planning to force them to do his bidding so he could destroy the SPD Rangers. When Cruger was kidnapped, Broodwing took advantage of this and invaded the Delta Base with the intent of using the Delta Command Megazord to destroy Newtech City, but he was arrested and contained by the Canine Cannon when the plan backfired. =Mora/Morgana= Morgana is a servant of Emperor Gruumm. Gruumm found Morgana and turned her into Mora. She initially appeared as Mora, a 10-year-old girl who is pure evil and is a gifted pictomancer, being able to create real monsters from her drawings. Mora enjoyed playing with dolls. She has multiple contacts in the criminal underworld such as General Valko and Shorty. As Mora, she was very spoiled and got on Gruumm's nerves. She took advantage of a young, lonely boy named Sam by promising to be his friend if he would use his power of teleportation to help her monster, Bugglesworth. Sam finally realized the evil acts that Bugglesworth was committing and helped Z Delgado foil Mora's plan to turn people into dolls. After the defeat of her ally, General Valko, Gruumm punished Mora by reverting her to her adult form, Morgana. She was known for both her beauty and strength but she thought she looked hideous as an adult (a sentiment Piggy also shares with the belief she looked better as Mora). Morgana became desperate to be given back her youth, and set about trying to impress Gruumm and make him turn her back into Mora. Some later she reveals she has a battle suit and dons it when she fights along with the villains. Morgana was armed with energy projection, martial art techniques, and she occasionally controlled giant robots. Despite being an adult, Morgana still acted like a child, albeit an extremely sadistic and powerful one; her first battle was a grudge match against Z for shooting her doll, where she beat Z into submission and then walked away to rub it in. When Morgana was successful in retrieving the Hymotech Synthetic Plasma from Newtech Laboratory, Gruumm granted her wish and turned her back into Mora. However, Omni soon forced Mora to pledge her allegiance to him under his mind control. As a result of this, Mora's personality underwent a dramatic change; she even discarded her beloved doll into the abyss inside the ship, and started wearing a more militaristic outfit instead of her dress, and wore her hair up. Near the end of the series, Cruger confronted Mora on Gruumm's ship. She threw as many monsters as she could (given the amount of paper in her sketchpad) at him, but he destroyed them all and confined her. Mora is played by Olivia James-Baird and Morgana is played by Josephine Davison. =A-Squad= The A-Squad was the Space Patrol Delta Academy's elite Ranger team, the defenders of Earth. The members of A-Squad are: * Charlie (A-Squad Red) Charlie was the only one of the five characters to be named, in the credits at the end. She is a Hispanic human female. She is portrayed by Gina Varela. * A-Squad Blue An alien male of an unknown race. He is voiced by Nick Kemplen. * A-Squad Green An African-American human male. He is voiced by D.J. Sena. * A-Squad Yellow A blond Caucasian human male. He is voiced by Greg Cooper II. * A-Squad Pink An Asian human female. She is portrayed by Motoko Nagino and voiced by Claire Dougan. During their early appearances in the series, they only appear morphed and are sent out to face the newest threat to the planet's safety. However, the A-Squad were already corrupt. Bridge sensed \\"something off\\" with their aura in the first episode, but didn't have the chance to find out what. In the episode \\"Confronted\\", the A-Squad is sent to the Helix Nebula to defend it from Emperor Gruumm. This was a trap and contact is lost with them in \\"Walls\\" after it was made clear they were being overwhelmed. They were considered \\"missing in action\\". In this episode, A-Squad Red's voice was distorted in editing to sound male instead of female. Unknown to the Rangers, the A-Squad had survived and had defected to Gruumm's side, wanting to be on \\"the winning team\\" (as stated in \\"Endings\\"). They bide their time, destroying the SPD Gamma 4 base (confirmed at conventions and in interviews by the show's producers), before finally faking a crash-land on Gamma-Orion and sending an SOS to have the B-Squad 'find' them alive. The B-Squad Rangers soon became frustrated when Cruger abruptly dismissed them to debrief the A-Squad. However, at the end of \\"Resurrection\\", the A-Squad revealed their true allegiance and kidnapped Commander Cruger. Following this treachery, the B-Squad battled with the A-Squad. Despite the A-Squad initially having the upper hand, B-Squad managed to overcome them with a combination of smarter battle tactics and S.W.A.T. Mode. Escalating the battle, the A-Squad upped the ante by unleashing their own Megazord, which transforms from Broodwing's drill vehicle. A battle ensued, but when the Delta Command Base was overtaken by Broodwing's forces and transformed into the Delta Command Megazord to destroy the city, the Omegamax Megazord was disabled and the Delta Squad Megazord was destroyed. After the B-Squad had recovered, they recovered the S.W.A.T. flyers from the secret underground zord bay – which only Bridge had known about – and used the S.W.A.T. Megazord to destroy the A-Squad's Megazord, finally defeating them. The A-Squad was found guilty of treason and contained by the B-Squad with their Delta Morphers without a further fight. Commander Cruger promoted B-squad rangers to the A-squad status but at the request of B-Squad (who felt that they were B-Squad rather than A-Squad) the A-Squad \\"ranking\\" was retired and the B-squad was made the highest ranked team in SPD. In the pages of Jetix Magazine, the A-Squad makes an appearance in the S.P.D. comic strip in the two part \\"finale\\" of the strip called \\"Invasion\\". Here, they are brainwashed by Gruumm as opposed to corrupted, which is consistent with the original outline for their storyline, and turn on the S.P.D. defense armada orbiting Earth. They are disposed of by B-Squad after a brief battle in the following issue and are not seen again. Their ranking is given to B-Squad for defeating Gruumm and Omni. =Krybots= The Krybots are the Troobian Empire's foot soldiers which come in many varieties. The Krybots come in three different varieties, each one stronger than the previous. The most commonly used and weakest version are ones that have round, gray-colored heads. Bluehead Krybots Bluehead Krybots are stronger versions of the normal Krybots. Like their names suggest, they have blue, x-shaped heads and have blue breastplates. They wield laser blasters and sometimes swords. They are summoned from spherical devices that resemble their heads. The Bluehead Krybots are voiced by Derek Judge. Orangehead Krybots Orangehead Krybots are the strongest version of the Krybots. Like their name implies, they have spikey, orange heads and orange and black bodies. They wield swords in battle and can summon powerful attacks like the Triforce Shockwave to attack with. They are summoned from orange, spikey spherical devices that resemble their heads. The Orangehead Krybots are voiced by James Gaylyn. =Criminals= These are the criminals hired by the Troobian Empire. Some of them are drawn up by Mora. These criminals are adapted from the criminals that appeared in Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger. While a few of them have grown, most of them pilot giant robots. * Praxis (voiced by Bruce Hopkins) - Praxis appears as a walking blue diamond/bee-themed alien with red wings and a large red star on his forehead. Praxis was drawn up by Mora and sent inside the Giant Drill Robot to destroy the city. * Ringbah (voiced by Bruce Hopkins) - An alien bounty hunter hired by Gruumm to destroy the Rangers. Ringbah appears as a short alien wrapped in gray wires.

According to Z, his dossier possibly called him Trilondon or Trilondonian. Z coined the nickname T-Top after giving up on pronouncing his true name properly. Broodwing used his bats to cause T-Top to go berserk until the Rangers restored him to size. Following Hydrax's defeat, it was mentioned by the Rangers that T-Top will not be allowed to return for the damages that he caused. * Hydrax (voiced by Sarah Thomson) - A Fernovian bank robber who got help from Broodwing to frame T-Top. A Fernovian is a plant-based alien who can jettison water at an extremely high level. * Bugglesworth (voiced by Kelson Henderson) - A Cthulhu-themed monster drawn up by Mora that looks like a big fat pink baby with a cloak with tentacles for hair.

He and Sky were best friends until Dru was sent to the Nebula Academy where he shortly became missing in action. His marksmanship is nearly unmatched. He turned out to be working for Broodwing in his alien form of Giganis and attempted to assassinate Commander Cruger. When Giganis was defeated and regressed back to Dru, Sky placed him under arrest. * Sinuku (voiced by James Coleman) - An evil snake-themed scientist who originally used his brilliant mind to develop weapons. He escapes from K0-35's satellite prison when Broodwing broke him out. * \\"Debugger\\" - A balance-themed monster brought to life by Mora. He held a bus full of people hostage. * General Benaag (voiced by James Gaylyn) - General Benaag led the attack on Sirius and was second-in-command to Emperor Gruumm on Sirius. During the battle, Commander Cruger's wife Isinia was abducted by Benaag, leaving a personal war between Benaag and Cruger. When he was finally arrested by Cruger, Benaag was revealed to be innocent of Isinia's murder, foreshadowing the later revelation that Isinia was in fact alive. * Drakel (voiced by Mike Havoc) - A Vampiranoid hired by Gruumm to steal a stone called The Evil. A Vampiranoid is a werewolf/vampire bat alien that is nocturnal and cannot handle being in the sun. * General Valko (voiced by Jason Hoyte) - Valko is a ruthless General from the Perterian Army whom Mora recruited as Gruumm's new second-in-command ever since Cruger contained General Benaag. * General Tomars (voiced by Campbell Cooley) - Tomars is a criminal who had a device that could transport a person to any location in this or sixteen other dimensions. * Wootox (voiced by Jeremy Birchall) - Wootox is an infamous alien criminal responsible for the destruction of over ninety planets and often flips a coin to make decisions.

He was brought to the present by Broodwing to serve him. Jack later returned him to his time. * \\"Invador\\" - A green-headed criminal who came to Earth to cause trouble. * Changtor (voiced by Darren Young) - Syd and Z fought this monster alone as per Fowler Birdy's command. * Green Eyes (voiced by Matthew Sutherland) - He was sent by Gruumm to steal gold. He took a friendly Indian- like alien security guard hostage in the process. * Shorty (voiced by Ray Trickett) - Shorty is a goblin-like alian the galaxy's second most wanted criminal and the younger brother of Devastation. Shorty is a powerful fighter with metallic fists and rubbery skin that is unaffected by most blows. In an alternate timeline, the appearance of Shorty and Devastation caused Earth to be conquered by the Troobians. Shorty was defeated by the Omega Ranger with the Omegamax Megazord. Unlike most SPD villains, Shorty was destroyed and not arrested. He is voiced by Ray Trickett. * Devastation (voiced by Kelson Henderson) - Devastation is the galaxy's most wanted criminal and one of the most powerful foes the Rangers ever faced. He arrived on Earth in response to a signal sent by his younger brother Shorty and Morgana. In an alternate timeline, his appearance on Earth allowed the Troobians to conquer Earth. After a grueling battle, his robot was destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord riding the Omegamax Cycle and Devastation was arrested. His defeat altered the timeline for the better. * Mysticon (voiced by Barnie Duncan) - Mysticon is a failing street magician.

Many of these giant robots were sold to Gruumm and his minions by Broodwing. Many of the robots were upgraded and recolored versions of past versions. * Model #1 (a.k.a. Conenose Robot') - A series of lobster/fiddler crab-themed robots. The first model of Giant Robot with a triangle-shaped body and blades for arms, the first one was used against the A-Squad when they piloted the Delta Squad Megazord. A second version of this robot was piloted by Ringbah with differently styled blades and colors, this one was destroyed by the Red, Green, Yellow and Pink Delta Runners. A third one was made, this one colored orange and had a pair of scissor-like blades for a right arm, and was piloted by a Bluehead Krybot in \\"Abandoned\\" and was destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord. A fourth one, almost identical to the last, was used by Silverhead in \\"Robotpalooza\\" and was destroyed by the Deltamax Megazord. A black, white and silver version of this robot was remote-controlled by Professor Mooney in \\"Katastrophe\\" but was destroyed by the Delta Squad and Omegamax Megazords. * Model #2 (a.k.a. Mega Drill) - A second giant robot used was a tank-like vehicle composed of a giant drill-tipped turbine and had spikes. It was piloted by Praxis, but was destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord. * Model #3 (a.k.a Dish Robot) - The third giant robot was yellow and orange colored and had a satellite dish on it's head. The first version was piloted by the childlike Bugglesworth. It was destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord. A second version of this robot later turned up in \\"Robotpalooza\\" piloted by Chiaggo, but was destroyed by the S.W.A.T. Megazord. * Model #4 (a.k.a. Ninja Robot) - The fourth giant robot had large bat-like wings and fought like a ninja, this first version was piloted by Sinuku, who used De-magnetrons to amplify its firepower, but in the end it was defeated when the Delta Squad Megazord deflected its energy back at it. A second version of this robot was piloted by Wootox in \\"Recognition,\\" but was destroyed by the Delta Command Megazord. * Model #5 (a.k.a. Drill Robot) - The fifth giant robot had drills for fingers and for its nose, the first version was piloted by a Bluehead Krybot but was destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord. The second version of this model was piloted by Green Eyes in \\"Perspective.\\" It was destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord. * Model #6 (a.k.a. Gladiator Robot) - The sixth giant was a gladiator-stylized robot that wielded a round shield and spear. The first version was piloted by a Bluehead Krybot but was defeated by the Delta Squad Megazord and then devoured by Goradon. The second version of this robot was piloted by Invador in \\"Dismissed,\\" but it too was destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord. * Goradon - Goradon was a massive, cybernetic lifeform composed of a spherical body with an enormous mouth and tentacles that possessed incredible destructive powers. General Valko vied to control Goradon so that he may present the cyborg beast to Gruumm and prove his worthiness in the Troobian Empire. To gain control, Valko needed a cyborg girl named S.O.P.H.I.E. (who was a \\"Series One Processor Hyper Intelligent Encryptor\\"). After the Rangers fought and defeated a giant robot piloted by a Bluehead, Goradon devoured the fallen robot. Valko was able to gain some control over Goradon after kidnapping SOPHIE and using her to control it, but the Rangers were able to rescue SOPHIE, defeat Valko and destroyed Goradon with the Delta Command Megazord. * Model #7 (a.k.a. Robot God Marato) - The seventh giant robot was called Marato, it was a strange- looking very large chest of drawers-themed robot where it's drawers could hold objects the size of buildings. Broodwing used this robot to steal and contain temples and buildings in Kyoto, Japan. Kruger was forced to pilot Delta Command to Kyoto, there the Delta Command Megazord was able to free the temples captured by Marato and destroyed the robot. A second version of Marato was piloted by Broodwing in \\"Badge\\" to attack the Delta Base, but was destroyed by the Delta Command Megazord. * Model #8 (a.k.a. 'Robot of Destruction) - The eighth giant robot was known as the Robot of Destruction. It was pink in color, had a face on its torso and resembled a demon with horns. It was piloted by Devastation. This robot was incredibly powerful, able to beat back the Rangers' current arsenal. It wasn't until Sam arrived were the tables turned and this robot destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord riding the Omegamax Cycle. A second version of this robot appeared in \\"Reflections\\" Pt. 1 piloted by Slate, but it was destroyed by the Delta Squad Megazord. * Model #9 (a.k.a. Horned Robot) - The ninth giant robot had horns an oblong body, bat-like ears and scissor-shaped claws. The first one was piloted by Mysticon and destroyed by the Deltamax Megazord. In \\"Robotpalooza,\\" Delapoo piloted this robot the next time it was seen and was destroyed by the S.W.A.T. Megazord. Later on in \\"Missing,\\" Bork piloted a gold-colored version of this robot. It was destroyed by the S.W.A.T. Megazord. * Model #10 (a.k.a. Angel Robot) - The tenth giant robot resembled a gold and silver angel wielding a spear. Only one of these robots was used where it was piloted by a Bluehead Krybot in \\"Reflection Part 2\\", but was destroyed by the Omegamax Megazord piloted by Jack. * Model #11 (a.k.a. Cyclops Robot) - The eleventh giant robot had a black and bulky body and a triangle-shaped head with a blue eye. The first version of this robot was piloted by Thresher, but was destroyed by the Deltamax Megazord. The second appeared in \\"Robotpalooza\\" driven by Blobgoblin, but was destroyed by the Delta Squad and Omegamax Megazords. * Model #12 (a.k.a. Jet Robot) - The twelfth giant robot used was a blue and silver cycloptic robot piloted by Gineka. It can transform into a stealth aircraft. This giant robot was destroyed by the S.W.A.T. Megazord. * Gigabot - Gigabot was an enormous dinosaur-like robot that was built by Professor Mooney and Broodwing using components of past giant robots. The Gigabot has the arms of the Drill Robot #1, the shoulders of the Jet Robot, the remains of the Mega Drill for it's chest, the jet boosters of the Robot of Destruction, the legs of the Ninja Robot, and the tail of the Conenose Robot #2. It was one of the most powerful giant robots but was destroyed by the S.W.A.T. Megazord. * Model #13 (a.k.a. A-Squad Megazord) - The thirteenth and final giant robot used in the series was piloted by both Broodwing and the A-Squad. In its initial form, it took the form of a giant drill that Broodwing used to burrow into Delta Command HQ. This robot was later hijacked by the A-Squad and transformed into an orange and silver humanoid form that resembled Broodwing himself. The A-Squad used it to battle the smaller Megazords while Broodwing used the captured Delta Command Megazord to destroy Newtech City. This robot destroyed the Delta Squad Megazord, but the Rangers were able to destroy the robot with the S.W.A.T. Megazord and arrested and contained the A-Squad.

Mystic Rangers The powers of the Mystic Rangers are derived from beings known as the Ancient Titans, creatures with great elemental powers, symbolized by mythological creatures from various Earth mythologies on the Ranger's visors (the creatures being the phoenix, the sprite, the garuda, the minotaur, and the mermaid). To date, they are the only team of Rangers to not have some kind of team-up special with another Ranger team in their own season. In the events of \\"Shattered Grid,\\" it is revealed that the Mystic Force team are one of the few who have not yet been attacked by Drakkon's forces, due to the fact that when they answer the late Zordon's summons, the entire team is present, including Udonna as the White Mystic Ranger. The Mystic Force Rangers made a cameo in the footage in Power Rangers Beast Morphers. =Nicolas 'Nick' Russell= Nicolas 'Nick' Russell is the Red Mystic Ranger. He is also Madison's love interest. Ever since his parents have been away for business trips and other important things, he has been riding on his motorcycle from relative to relative. Nick arrived in Briarwood to live with his sister on the same day that evil was unleashed. He was the first to volunteer to rescue the old man's brother in the forest. However, Nick did not believe in magic or enough in himself to become a Ranger at the same time that the others did. It wasn't until he had a vision of the other Rangers being badly beaten by Koragg the Knight Wolf that he returned to save them and accepted both the magic and his responsibilities. He now possesses a strong sense of determination and duty - it was he who first decided to fight the dark armies even without his powers in Dark Wish, and who encouraged the others to continue the final battle against Morticon. Nick works at the Rock-Porium with the other Rangers and spends his spare time fixing his motorcycle. He never had the chance to make any real friends before moving to Briarwood and values the friendships he has - he was the first to befriend the troblin Phineas and was willing to surrender to the villain Oculous in order to save his friends. Although Nick isn't the type to hold grudges and is noted for his honour in combat by Daggeron, he makes an exception for Koragg. The Knight Wolf had repeatedly used magical telepathy to draw Nick into combat and the two had become constant rivals; during Dark Wish, Nick attempted to fight Koragg even though he possessed no magic or Ranger power. Nick has found he can use the connection in reverse, contacting Koragg. His anger regarding Koragg was strong and he once tried to fight Koragg even when he had no magic to help him. Upon discovering Koragg was really Udonna's husband and long-lost hero Leanbow, he refused to believe that his enemy could be on the side of good and was enraged by a suggestion that he was like Leanbow. He was also quite jealous of Daggeron because he was the frog whom Maddie kissed unknowingly. Nick fancied Maddie! Nick was adopted as a baby and never knew his birth parents, and he keeps the red blanket his baby self was originally wrapped in for sentimental reasons. He took a while to open up to the Rangers about this. In Heir Apparent, Part II, it was finally revealed that Nick is Bowen, the long-lost son of Leanbow and Udonna, who had been taken to the human realm by Phineas for safe-keeping. He is also \\"The Light\\" - the child of the most powerful warrior and the most powerful sorceress, with the potential to destroy the Darkness forever and the primary target for the Ten Terrors. He had conflicting emotions over the discovery and subsequent disappearance of his father and the knowledge that he was Koragg - he had said he didn't care about Leanbow, but alone with Phineas he showed that this was not the truth. His cousin is Clare, which made her mother Niella his deceased aunt. In the finale battle, Nick was possessed by the Master and was transformed into a new Koragg, destroying villages in the Briarwood forest. He fought his father, destroying Rootcore in the process, before Leanbow freed him from the spell by demorphing and refusing to fight, causing Nick's mind to fight off the spell rather than kill his father. He was pushed to the limit afterward, seeing Udonna captured, the world destroyed and his father briefly killed, but was convinced by Madison that he couldn't give up and that the Rangers needed him to keep fighting; he was able to wound the Master enough to force him to retreat and, in the last clash, led the Rangers in destroying him. Soon after the final battle, Nick along with Udonna and Leanbow rode off into the sunset on motorcycles to see his adopted parents. Nick finally believed that Maddie only loved Nick. With hints of a possible romance with Madison, Nick promised Madison he would return to Briarwood for her, leaving her with his old baby blanket. He would later rejoin his teammates in Power Rangers Super Megaforce as part of an army of veteran Rangers who aided the Megaforce Rangers in their final battle with the Armada. Nick made a cameo in the footage in Power Rangers Beast Morphers. As the Red Mystic Ranger, Nick wields the power of fire. He is always the first to rush in, using actions before thinking. Several times, he has proven to have far more innate magical power than he should, such as when he instinctively knew the spell to re-seal Morticon in the Underworld, and once being able to tame Koragg's loyal horse Catastros which may be because Koragg (Leanbow) was his father. Nick's weapon is the Magi Staff Striker. His vehicles are the Mystic Racer and the Mystic Speeder. His Titan forms are the Mystic Phoenix and he also commands Brightstar. As the Red Legend Warrior, Nick gains the Mystic Lion Staff which allows him to use the Fire Storm spell and become the Mystic Firebird. He later gains the power to combine with Fire Heart to become the Red Dragon Fire Ranger, possessing enough power to bring down an army of Hidiacs and Styxoids. Nick is portrayed by Firass Dirani. =Vida \\"V\\" Rocca= Vida Rocca, or just \\"V\\" to her fellow Rangers, is Madison's sister and the Pink Mystic Ranger, ironic because she hates the color pink (due to her hair has white/silver bangs). Vida loves to DJ at the Rock-Porium, and is one of Madison's most frequent film subjects. Although she is very no-nonsense, often to the point of bluntness, Vida is kind, generous, and loyal at the core; she defended Madison when she was accused of being withdrawn, and she protected Chip from being picked on when they were at school. Though she initially joined the other Rangers in teasing Xander when he began turning into a tree, thanks to his abuse of Clare's Perfection Potion, Vida was genuinely concerned about him, and was the most active in seeking an antidote for his condition. Most notably, Vida was able to deduce that Matoombo was not truly evil and could be convinced to leave the Master. She then gave him a chance to kill her without a fight in order to make him realize his actions would harm people. By series end, Vida had apparently gotten over her dislike of the color pink, having pink hair bangs in some scenes, and in the end, she dyed all her hair that color, which is similar to Nadira's pink hair style from Power Rangers: Time Force. She and her teammates joined the Megaforce Rangers and every other previous Ranger team in battling the Armada in Super Megaforce. As the Pink Mystic Ranger, Vida wields the power of wind. She has shapeshifting powers which allow her to conjure giant, butterfly-shaped \\"Mystical Wings\\". She usually rushes into battle, making her an effective fighter. She owns a Mystic Racer and can change into the Mystic Sprite, which serves as the Mystic Dragon's head. In this form, she can use her shape-shifting magic to become a ball for the others to attack the enemy with. As the Pink Legend Warrior, Vida gains the Mystic Lion Staff which allows her to cast the Whirlwind spell and allows her, Madison, Chip, and Xander to become the Mystic Lion. Vida is portrayed by Angie Diaz. =Charles 'Charlie' \\"Chip\\" Thorn= Charles 'Charlie' Thorn, known as \\"Chip\\" to his friends, is the self-proclaimed \\"superhero expert\\". He is considered a little odd because he loves fairy tales and phases in and out of reality. His affinity for superheroes had him wearing a superhero costume to school on several occasions, including to the prom. He was deemed by Madison as \\"the perfect example of a non-human species,\\" when she filmed him eating a pizza topped with chicken, pepperoni, cheese, and chocolate marshmallows. Chip is a fantastic archer, a member of the chess club at school, and a part of COUNTV - Containment Of Underworld Nocturnal Transylvanian Vampires. He is always cheerful and eager to learn all he can about magic, and began to idolize Daggeron during Soul Specter. After the final battle, he was last seen telling fictionalized tales of his battles as a Power Ranger to ladies from both realms. Despite their extremely different personalities, Chip has been close friends with Vida ever since she stuck up for him when they were children. When she was turned into a vampire, he showed a far more serious and intense side of himself in his attempts to save her, including taking on Koragg and Necrolai by himself. He is extremely passionate about being a Ranger, taking it much harder than the others when they failed to save people from Gnatu and berating Nick/Bowen for betraying everything they stood for when he wanted to surrender to Oculous. He later joined the Ranger army in Super Megaforce, battling alongside his teammates to face the Warstar Armada's last army. As the Yellow Mystic Ranger, Chip wields the power of lightning. His main weapon is the Magi Staff Crossbow. He owns a Mystic Racer and his Titan Form is the Mystic Garuda, which becomes the wings for both the Mystic Dragon and Titan Megazord. As the Yellow Legend Warrior, Chip gains the Mystic Lion Staff, which allows him to cast the Lightning Bolt spell and allows him to join with Vida, Madison and Xander to become the Mystic Lion. Chip is portrayed by Nic Sampson. Also he is the childish one amongst them. =Alexander \\"Xander\\" Bly= Alexander \\"Xander\\" Bly is an Australian who now lives in the United States. When he first arrived, he was bullied mercilessly about his accent and was often ostracized. Consequently, he understands and sympathizes with loners. He is an adept skateboarder and enjoys showing off when he rides. Xander will use his charming smile to his advantage every chance he gets, and when faced with trouble, he will employ what he calls \\"Plan Xander\\", which is nothing more than trying to sweet talk his way out of the situation. Unfortunately for him, \\"Plan Xander\\" has been unsuccessful against Necrolai and other minions of Morticon. Xander works alongside his fellow Rangers at the Rock-Porium, where he prefers to assign tasks to his co-workers, rather than to actually work himself; he refers to this as \\"supervising\\". He briefly clashed with Daggeron when the latter became the Rangers' mentor, seemingly out of the blue. Xander's overconfidence and inflated ego have gotten him into danger on several occasions, but his willingness in owning up to his mistakes has earned him several spell codes. After the final battle against the Master, he was promoted to manager of the Rock-Porium. As the Green Mystic Ranger, Xander wields the power of the earth and can call upon the Mystic Muscles, magically bulking up his muscles to gigantic proportions. His weapon is the Magi Staff Axe. He was the first Mystic Force Ranger to use the Mystic Force Fighters spell code and also owns a Mystic Racer. Xander's Titan form is the Mystic Minotaur, which makes up the bulk of the Mystic Dragon and Titan Megazord formations. As the Green Legend Warrior, Xander gains the Mystic Lion Staff which allows him to cast the Rock Slide spell and allows him to join with Vida, Madison, and Chip to become the Mystic Lion. Xander appeared alongside former Power Rangers Tori Hanson, Kira Ford, Bridge Carson, and Adam Park in the 15th anniversary special \\"Once a Ranger\\" (an episode of Power Rangers Operation Overdrive). When the new villain Thrax disabled the Operation Overdrive Power Rangers' link to the Morphing Grid, Xander was one of five Rangers summoned by the Sentinel Knight to defend Earth in their stead. He was the first of the veteran Rangers to make his entrance, ensnaring Mig the Fearcat in a mass of vines. He later attempted to use \\"Plan Xander\\" on a group of Chillers when he and the veteran Rangers were ambushed by them at Angel Grove and was, not surprisingly, unsuccessful. During the climactic battle with Thrax and his allies, Xander teamed up with Will and Dax against the Fearcats. He drew the attention of the Fearcats, using the Mystic Force Fighters to deflect their laser blasts before punching the villains to the ground, giving Will and Dax the openings they needed to use the Drive Slammer and Drive Vortex for the win. After the Rangers' victory, he told the Operation Overdrive Rangers that they were welcome to drop by the Rock-Porium anytime, and he would give them a 10 percent discount. He and his teammates later joined the final battle against the Warstar Armada in Super Megaforce. Xander is portrayed by Richard Brancatisano. =Madison \\"Maddie\\" Rocca= Madison Rocca, sometimes called \\"Maddie\\", is Vida's sister. She is also Nick's love interest. Dubbing herself \\"the sister with the common sense\\", Madison is a budding filmmaker and prefers to express herself by filming people on her video camera. Because of this, many people, including Leelee and Nick, tease her about \\"hiding\\" behind her camera (which Nick later regretted doing when Vida called him out). Madison is studious and shy, and rarely has fun in the conventional way. Despite this, she has shown herself to be one of the more open and friendly of the Rangers; she was the first of the group to reach out to Nick, and was also the one who talked a disgruntled Jenji into coming home. She had harbored a phobia of frogs ever since Vida put one down her shirt when they were children and overcame that fear when she kissed a frog that had saved her from Jester the Pester; the frog reverted to his true form, Daggeron, the Solaris Knight. Madison worries that she is not a vital part of the team, but deep down, she has a true passion for protecting people and it was this that kept her battling against Magma when the rest of the team had fallen. When Nick wanted to give up in the face of the Master's power, Madison refused to let him and told him they needed to keep fighting. It is also shown in the series that she and Nick have budding feelings towards each other, and at the end of the series he left her the baby blanket that had served as his only link to his biological parents for years and promised he would come back for it. As the Blue Mystic Ranger, Madison wields the power of water. She is usually not the first to engage an enemy, but is a competent fighter nonetheless. Her main weapon is her Magi Staff. She also owns a Mystic Racer and can morph into the Mystic Mermaid. As the Blue Legend Warrior, Madison gains the Mystic Lion Staff, which allows her to cast the Tidal Wave spell and allows her, Vida, Chip, and Xander to become the Mystic Lion. She and the other Mystic Rangers later joined the veteran Rangers in Super Megaforce. Madison is portrayed by Melanie Vallejo. =Daggeron= Daggeron is a firm but fair, jolly and wise warrior who trained under Leanbow, and due to this claims to have been \\"trained by the best.\\" During the Great Battle, he was tasked to take baby Nick/Bowen to safety and was attacked by Calindor. The two of them fought viciously and were dually cursed, ending up sealed in a cave for nineteen years and with Daggeron turned into a frog. When the seal was broken and Madison kissed the frog in gratitude for saving her life, Daggeron reassumed his human form once again. At Udonna's request, he took the Mystic Rangers under his wing, training them to reach their full potential in a tough yet fair manner. He is also a wizard on par with Imperious, and stands alongside Nick as one of the only warriors to defeat Koragg in one-on-one combat. Daggeron and Imperious are bitter enemies because of their past. In Heir Apparent, Daggeron accepted Imperious' challenge at the Dimension of Wandering Souls to finish what they started 19 years ago, but this was a trap, and Imperious stole the Solar Streak Megazord's power in order to use a forbidden spell to create the Chimera which seemingly destroyed Daggeron. Thanks to Jenji, Daggeron survived and rode the mystical unicorn, Brightstar, to help the Rangers before settling things with Imperious for good in a Bound Battle to the death. Imperious cheated and wounded Daggeron, but through his determination and honor, Daggeron was able to destroy his old enemy. When Udonna left to find Leanbow, he oversaw the Rangers' activities until her return. He gained a new nemesis in Megahorn of the Ten Terrors, being almost killed by him in their first battle before playing a key role in bringing him down in The Snow Prince. He was killed by the Master in the final battle, but was revived by Necrolai at Leelee's behest. Itassis then approached him, seeking knowledge of courage. Daggeron would go on to join his students in the final battle with the Warstar Armada in Super Megaforce. As the Solaris Knight, Daggeron wields the power of the Sun and owns a feline genie named Jenji. In battle, he can convert Jenji's lamp into a blaster called the Solaris Laser Lamp which, in addition to always hitting its intended target, can launch Jenji forth in a bright stream of light in a finishing move called the \\"Jenji Shining Attack\\". He was also seen with a sword in one episode when he was in his Mystic Mode. Daggeron pilots the Solar Streak train, which can transform into the Solar Streak Megazord. He uses a Magic Carpet to get around Briarwood, sometimes racing on it with the Mystic Racers. Daggeron also has an Ancient Mystic Mode like Leanbow. He first used it in battle with Imperious, and used it to defeat him. However, despite the power of the Mystic Mode, it was ineffective against Megahorn before Daggeron found out his weak spot. Daggeron is portrayed by John Tui, who also portrayed Anubis Cruger in Power Rangers S.P.D. =Udonna= Peta Rutter as Udonna. Udonna is the White Mystic Ranger. She was a powerful and talented sorceress whose people fought in the Great Battle against the forces of darkness, which ended with the evil forces being cast into the Underworld. She lost many of her friends in the Battle, as well as her entire family (except her niece Clare); her sister Niella was a powerful sorceress called the Gatekeeper, who sealed the Underworld at the cost of her life, while her husband Leanbow was left inside the Underworld trying to hold the enemy back and her infant son Bowen went missing during the Battle. After this, she prepared for the return of the forces of darkness and built Rootcore deep within the forest near Briarwood; when an earthquake broke the seal and freed the evil forces in present day, she recruited the five Mystic Rangers and gave them their powers. As the White Mystic Ranger, Udonna commands the power of snow and could become a giant version of herself (not a Mystic Titan like the other Rangers). However, she is defeated in battle by Koragg, who claims her Snow Staff and her Ranger powers along with it. She currently mentors and trains both the Rangers and her niece and apprentice Clare (who became the Gatekeeper of the Underworld upon her mother's death) in the ways of magic. Udonna eventually discovers that Bowen is alive and was taken to the human realm by Phineas, and later still discovers that Nick is Bowen. Udonna is later captured and held a prisoner in the Underworld. While in her cell, she manages to channel the energies of her Snow Staff to help the Rangers fight Morticon. Afterwards, Koragg prevents Udonna from reclaiming her Snow Staff. Udonna then states that she can only feel pity for Koragg and teleports out of the Underworld. When the Rangers are sent to the Underworld in \\"Heir Apparent\\", Udonna uses dark magic to rescue them, even though according to Clare, this would mean she would permanently lose all her magic. She is able to save the Rangers, but is then badly hurt by the Master, only surviving due to the actions of Koragg, who is then revealed to be Leanbow. After the revelation, she is considerably weaker, and it may be true that due to her use of dark magic that she is now merely human. She is left distraught when she sees her husband turned into Koragg once more, but the discovery that Nick is Bowen rekindled her belief in magic and she is able to free Leanbow once again. Despite his apparent death against the Master, she believes him to still be alive and leaves the Rangers to go on a quest to find him (starting in \\"The Light\\"), with Clare as her companion. When she and Clare reach the Lake of Lament, they are confronted by Hekatoid, who knocks Clare unconscious and kidnaps Udonna, and put her under a spell to make her unconscious. The other Rangers attempt to deal with Hekatoid, but it proves useless when he steals their powers. During this time, Leelee, Clare, and Phineas sneak into the Underworld to rescue Udonna. While they can do nothing to help her at first, Leelee produces the Snow Staff (stolen from her mother) and the trio use it to revive Udonna. Udonna, now morphed and with magic once again, reappears in Briarwood and the six Rangers combine their powers to defeat Hekatoid once and for all. In \\"The Return\\", Udonna astral projects to find Leanbow in the Underworld. There, she finds him unconscious and uses the power of her Snow Staff to revive him. In the finale, she fights Sculpin personally, although she tries to reason with him and both are sent to the Underworld. However, Udonna is rescued by Necrolai and Itassis. She helps the other Rangers in destroying the Master. In the end, she goes with her husband and son on motorbikes to visit Nick's foster parents. Udonna was portrayed by Peta Rutter (young & old). =Leanbow= Leanbow is Udonna's husband, Nick's father, and the mentor of Daggeron and Calindor. He was known for his honor and valor which Calindor resented. As a Mystic, he can assume \\"Ancient Mystic Mode\\", resembling a red/purple fiery demon wielding a sword and shield. Twenty years prior to the series, Leanbow led the other Mystics in the Great Battle against the Supreme Master of the Underworld, and his Forces of Darkness led by Morticon in order to prevent them entering the human realm. The forces of good magic eventually forced the Forces of Darkness through the Gate of the Underworld, with Leanbow personally taking on Morticon at one point. In order to keep the Forces of Darkness from escaping the Underworld, he held back the Darkness hordes from the Gate while Niella the Gatekeeper sealed both it and Leanbow into the Underworld. In this single act, Leanbow would be lost to the Forces of Darkness and Niella would use up the rest of her powers as the Gatekeeper, giving up her life force in the process. For twenty years, Udonna and the others thought that they had lost Leanbow forever, killed in the battle that ensued behind the gate. But in reality, Leanbow had survived to reach and seal the Master - but before he fell, the Master was able to transform his enemy into his most loyal minion, Koragg. Though devoid of the memories of his old self, Koragg retained a few aspects of his previous life such as honor manifest in refusal to destroy a foe he considers to be weaker, citing such an action as a waste of his time and energy. In Koragg's Trial, he revealed that he felt it was important to be honorable because only an honorable warrior could be trusted to serve the Master faithfully. This also allowed him to tame the wild horse Catastros, which became Koragg's personal Zord and gave him the ability to form the Centaurus Wolf Megazord and combine with Catastros to gain a centaur-like appearance. Koragg was the first villain released after years of imprisonment when the seal of the Underworld was cracked by the earthquake that hit Briarwood. Upon engaging Udonna as the White Mystic Ranger, who seemed familiar to him, in battle, he bested her and stole her Snow Staff but spared her life. Koragg often openly dueled with Morticon in a power struggle, shows contempt toward Necrolai, and bowed to no one except the Master. He has also lied to Morticon, keeping the Megazord power he stole from the Rangers for himself and claiming it was gone instead of using it to free Morticon. Despite this, however, he proved to be a loyal servant of the Master and a persistent antagonist for the Rangers. However strong the Rangers got, Koragg was always stronger, with the Master personally giving Koragg more power every day. When Imperious succeeded in transporting the Rangers to the Underworld, during the 2-part \\"Heir Apparent\\", so he could use their Legend Warrior powers to revive the Master, Udonna attempted to stop it only to be attacked by the Master himself. After an onslaught of forgotten memories flooded his mind, Koragg came to their aid at the last second. With the evil influence that had bound him now broken, Koragg revealed himself to be none other than Leanbow, shocking everyone present. He transported everyone out of the Underworld but despite that, Nick refused to trust him and viewed his reappearance to be \\"one of Koragg's tricks\\". Leanbow revealed his past about how he was transformed into Koragg by the Master, but when he absorbed the Virus that Imperious used on the Manticore Megazord to save them, it caused a unique side effect that caused him to regain his memory bit by bit. Leanbow was quickly taken back to the Underworld and transformed into Koragg again, leading to a final confrontation between him and Nick. He was on the verge of killing the Red Ranger when Udonna intervened and revealed that Nick was, in fact, their son Bowen, and the knowledge of this freed Leanbow from the Master's spell once more. The reunion was short-lived as the Master began to tear his way out of the Underworld and Leanbow, using a spell to prevent Udonna and the Rangers from intervening, travelled back to the Underworld to fight and seal the villain once again. With his Mystic Force Fire Strike attack, he sacrificed himself to bring down the Master and nearly all of the Underworld, and returning the Legend Warrior powers to the Rangers. While he appeared to be dead, Udonna firmly believed he \\"will return\\" and has gone on a quest to \\"bring him home\\". Her belief is confirmed in \\"Hard Heads\\" when the villainous Terror, Sculpin, scried to see what was preventing the resurrection of the Master. At the Lake of Lament, it was revealed that Leanbow is responsible for preventing the Master from being resurrected. Now Leanbow wears Koragg's violet Knight Wolf armor, but still fights on the side of good, stating \\"I wear the armor of Koragg, but my heart is that of Leanbow\\". In \\"The Snow Prince\\", Sculpin confronted Leanbow at the Lake of Lament taunting him with images of Megahorn's rampage. Leanbow refused to leave his post, but Sculpin persisted and showed Nick being injured during the battle. Nonetheless he still refused to come out of hiding. It wasn't until Sculpin raised the stakes and dispatched Black Lance to assist Megahorn did Leanbow finally leave his post and join the Rangers in battle. Leanbow appeared in the form of the Knight Wolf Centaur and engaged the chariot-riding Black Lance in battle. Leanbow eventually destroyed Black Lance's chariot and then transformed into the Centaurus Wolf Megazord. Maintaining the upper hand, he had Black Lance under control. Meanwhile, Necrolai appeared and planted onto the Centaurus Wolf Megazord a fish scale Sculpin had given her. Leanbow returned the underworld, purposely dragging Black Lance down with him. As he departed, Leanbow told the Rangers that he was proud of them and to continue the fight. In \\"Light Source,\\" Leanbow (still wearing the armor of Koragg) hid himself deep within the depths of the Underworld within a crystal-like barrier. Since one of Sculpin's fish scales was on him, Leanbow was discovered by Necrolai, who then informed Sculpin and the other Terrors of his whereabouts. Sculpin, Gekkor and Matoombo then went to Leanbow to personally fight him and to retrieve the Master's spirit from his body. Gekkor was the first to fight Leanbow, using his lightning speed to give him an edge. But Leanbow was able to weaken Gekkor by slashing him in the stomach with his Knight Saber, then summoning a Mystic Force Fire Strike attack to weaken him. This was when Sculpin stopped Gekkor from fighting and sent Matoombo to fight him. Matoombo was able to give Leanbow an even greater challenge, using his superior strength to bring Leanbow to his knees and to shatter his shield. This left Leanbow open for Sculpin to stab him in the back with his trident and extract the Master's spirit from his body, causing Leanbow to revert to his Ancient Mystic Mode. Sculpin then used his trident to create a fissure in the ground and send Leanbow plummeting into it, but before he fell too far, Leanbow grasped an outcropping, hanging on for dear life. In the episode \\"The Return,\\" Leanbow joins forces with the Mystic Rangers. While the Legend Warriors are facing Gekkor of the Ten Terrors in battle, Udonna finds and revives Leanbow using her good magic. The Legend Warriors find themselves overpowered, and are spared from certain doom once Leanbow appears and absorbs a flame attack Gekkor fired at them. Utilizing a new red Morpher, Leanbow transforms into the Wolf Warrior, a new form in which he bears armor almost exactly the same as Koragg's with the major difference being its crimson color. After displaying this new form, Leanbow quickly defeats Gekkor. Leanbow was forced to face Koragg again when the Master (attempting a pre-emptive strike) turned Nick into a new Koragg and used him to destroy villages in the Briarwood forest. The battle between Leanbow and the new Koragg devastated Rootcore before he freed his son by demorphing and allowing himself to be killed without a fight causing Nick's mind to break free of the Master's control. He then went with Daggeron to the Mystic Realm to face the Master, only to have his magic drained and be killed in battle. Revived by Necrolai, he joined in the final battle against the Master and helped overload him with good magic. In the aftermath, Leanbow joined his wife and son in leaving Briarwood to visit Nick's adoptive parents. Like his wife, he was absent from the final battle of Super Megaforce, though his powers were employed by Silver Megaforce Ranger Orion. Leanbow is portrayed by Chris Graham & Geoffrey Dolan. Allies of the Power Rangers=The Ancient Titans= Little is known about the supernatural beings known as the Ancient Titans, but they seem to be the source of the Mystic Rangers' powers. They appear during the Rangers' morphing sequence and when the Titan Megazord uses the \\"Titans Attack\\" finisher. The Ancient Mystic Titans are symbolized by mythological creatures from various Earth mythologies: * The Red Ancient Titan is symbolized by the Phoenix and is a representation of the element of fire. It appears as a man made of fire. * The Pink Ancient Titan is symbolized by the Sprite and is a representation of the element of wind. It appears as a fairy-like being with butterfly wings. * The Yellow Ancient Titan is symbolized by the Garuda and is a representation of the element of lightning. It appears as a sleek gold armored being with lightning bolt-like extensions. * The Green Ancient Titan is symbolized by the Minotaur and is a representation of the element of earth. It appears as a tree-like creature (similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's Ents). * The Blue Ancient Titan is symbolized by the Mermaid and is a representation of the element of water. It appears as a mermaid-like creature with four fin-like legs. Ancient Mystic Mode The Snow Prince and the Mystic Mother also appear to be Ancient Mystic Titans and there have been four other characters that also have forms that appear to be Ancient Titans, but are called \\"Ancient Mystic Modes\\". * The Gatekeepers (Clare and her dead mother Niella, sister to Udonna) have an Ancient Mystic Mode as the Gatekeeper, dubbed the Shining Moon Warrior. In this form, the Gatekeeper powers are derived from the moon. In this form, she can fire energy blasts, launch a laser rope, and fire the \\"Full Moon Blade\\". This form appears as a woman in an Arabian-style dress that resembles a bell. * Calindor had an Ancient Mystic Mode before dark magic overpowered him and he sided with the forces of evil, adopting the name Imperious. This form appears as a creature with many more lightning bolt-like extensions and two lightning bolt-like wings. Following his transformation into Imperious, he was still able to assume this form. * During Daggeron's morphing sequence, the viewer is given a brief glimpse of his Ancient Mystic Mode that presumably represents the sun (as his powers as the Solaris Knight are derived from the sun). This form appears as a golden being with various wing-like appendages. He was shown in this form during a flashback to the Great battle. When in a final bound battle with Imperious, Daggeron fought mostly in his Ancient Mystic Mode, instead of his morphed or unmorphed forms. He has also battled Megahorn in this form. Its powers include super-charged energy blasts, a golden sword, standard energy slashes, and a super slash * Leanbow also has an Ancient Mystic Mode, a red and purple-colored fiery demon- like form with a purple cape, armed with a jagged sword and a shield. He can also use his Wolf Warrior sword to deliver a double fire strike known as the \\"Ancient Power of the Phoenix\\". Niella Niella was the Gatekeeper of the Underworld and Udonna's sister, Nick Russell's maternal aunt, and Leanbow's sister-in-law. When Leanbow went into the Gates, he told her to seal the Gate with a spell, in which she sacrificed herself to make the spell work. Only her daughter Clare remains. Like Clare, Niella had an Ancient Mystic Mode dubbed the \\"Shining Moon Warrior\\". Clare for a long time believed she was more incompetent with her magical abilities unlike Niella. This was until Udonna admitted that her mother was about the same way when she first started. Niella (like Clare) was portrayed by Antonia Prebble. The Snow Prince The Snow Prince is an Ancient Mystic Titan and possibly the source of Udonna's powers. Long ago, he was mentor to all the Mystics including Leanbow. Currently, he resides in a parallel dimension he calls \\"The North.\\" For one day, he allowed Nick to teach Daggeron rather than vice versa. This was actually to teach Daggeron how to follow his instincts as Nick does. The Snow Prince also helped aid the rangers in fighting Megahorn and seemed to be a capable combatant in his own right. However, he noted that his powers were far weaker in our dimension than they were in his own. Thus, he used a spell attack called the Ancient Spell Seal—similar to the Titan Megazord's Mystic Spell Seal attack—to suck Megahorn into the North, however temporarily. After Daggeron finally learned his lesson, Snow Prince graciously allowed him to join the fight against Megahorn and then returned to his own dimension. In the finale \\"Mystic Fate,\\" he was sent back to the human realm by the \\"Mystic Mother\\" severely hurt to forewarn them of the impending disaster. The Snow Prince is voiced by Paolo Rotondo. The Mystic Mother The Mystic Mother, the \\"Empress of All Good Magic\\", is a colossal Ancient Titan-like being who rules over the Magic World and who first appears in the finale episode \\"Mystic Fate\\". Udonna has stated that in the \\"dark days\\", the Mystic Mother was known as Rita and that she had turned to Good Magic after being purified by Zordon's Energy Wave. The Mother herself remarked that she knew \\"firsthand the weakness of Evil,\\" and told the Master that he was giving her a headache. She was overwhelmed by the Master and seemingly killed, but was later revealed to have secretly escaped to regroup making Clare a \\"full\\" sorceress as she did. Her demeanor is that of a somewhat complacent, smug, but powerful enchantress. She is shown dressed in white much like other fictional heads of wizardly societies. She is portrayed in Japanese Mahou Sentai Magiranger footage by Machiko Soga, the same actress who portrayed Bandora in Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger and thus Rita Repulsa in the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Mystic Mother was voiced by Susan Brady. The Mystics The Mystics were five warriors that fought in the Great Battle against the forces of darkness, each symbolized by their own color and elemental affinity. They were led by Leanbow, the Red Mystic. The names of the Pink, Yellow, Green, and Blue Mystics' identities are unknown, and it appears that all but Leanbow perished during the Great Battle. The Power Rangers presumably replaced them to complete the second Great Battle. In Heir Apparent, Part I, viewers were able to get a clear view of the Mystics. Leanbow was the Red Mystic; the Yellow, and Green Mystics were also men; the Blue and Pink Mystics were women. =Clare Langtree= Clare Langtree, the Gatekeeper is a fictional character from the television series Power Rangers Mystic Force. She is a human sorceress in training, is offbeat, clumsy and bumbling, yet never gives up. She is both niece and apprentice to Udonna, the sorceress. She once feared that she was far worse with magic than her mother Niella, but has recently discovered she was just as clumsy as Clare when she first started practicing magic. Keeping the ties of Mystic Force with its source series Mahou Sentai Magiranger, Clare could be considered a less serious version of Heavenly Saint Lunagel, in which both are empowered by the Moon and have the duty of guarding the gates to Underworld/Infershia. Clare was originally just a comic relief character, with her poor spellcasting abilities serving as her gag. It was later revealed she was the heir to the role of the Gatekeeper, and that her mother had died using her powers to seal the Morlocks within the Underworld. As the Gatekeeper's daughter, Clare was the only one who could undo the seal. Udonna had promised to keep her from harm and to only give her the Gatekeeper powers when she was ready, but the machinations of Morticon forced Clare to inherit the powers early. Donning a mystical tiara that granted her the Gatekeeper powers, Clare proved herself to be highly courageous and powerful, taking on evil with determination and focus in her desire to rescue a captured Udonna. She weakened Necrolai and took away the Vampire Queen's new powers, but did not come out so well against Koragg. Beaten, she was used to unlock the gate to the Underworld and unleash Morticon's forces. With Nick's help, she was able to get free and used up the last of the tiara's powers to seal the gate once more. Even with the Gatekeeper powers gone, she still is an important ally to the Rangers and continues to resiliently work on her magic. She was responsible for hatching the baby Fire Heart, which imprinted on her as its mother, and took care of it as an infant. Even after Fire Heart grew up and is now many times her size, Clare still cares for it. Since Udonna lost her powers after using a powerful dark magic spell, Clare has recently become a much more competent sorceress, joining Udonna on her quest to find her husband, Leanbow. When the two reached the Lake of Lament, however, Hekatoid, one of the Ten Terrors, appeared. He knocked Clare unconscious and proceeded to kidnap Udonna. In \\"Light Source,\\" she, Phineas, and Leelee, traveled to the Underworld to rescue Udonna. While they could do nothing to help her at first, Leelee produced the Snow Staff, stolen from her mother, and the trio used it to revive her. After this, Leelee, Phineas, and Clare returned to Rootcore with the newly reenergized White Ranger. During the final battle in \\"Mystic Fate Pt. II\\", the Mystic Mother grants Clare the power of a Sorceress. After Udonna leaves Rootcore with Nick and Leanbow, she becomes the new Sorceress of Rootcore, turning the Xenotome to its final page in the last scene and successfully performing the vanishing spell that she was unable to accomplish in the first episode. She is portrayed by Antonia Prebble, who previously portrayed Nova, The Nova Ranger from Power Rangers: S.P.D. =Toby Slambrook= Toby Slambrook is a human in Briarwood that owns the \\"Rock Porium\\" music store where he employs the five core Rangers, unaware of the team's secret Ranger identities. He sometimes helps the Rangers in their battle against the undead without realizing that he has done so. He usually provides the Rangers with his own brand of humorous advice, and defended Nick when the others believed he stole money from the store. He is known for his musical knowledge and references, as well as for being a major fan of fictional rock-n-roller \\"Jake Bonebreaker\\". Although Toby may seem slow-witted, he is actually a good puzzle solver, though he sometimes seems slightly obsessive and can easily be distracted by the mention of a riddle he has yet to solve. Despite not being a wizard, he unwittingly seems to have a lot of contact with the magical world outside of Briarwood. He was seemingly the only one who heard the Solar Streak's engine when Daggeron transported the other Rangers. He is also notable for being the one who solved the puzzle leading to the Fire Heart. Toby was once mistaken for being the Gatekeeper, and once met and escorted Phineas to the dentist. When Imperious used Jenji to create a world where the Power Rangers did not exist, it allowed the forces of darkness to conquer the world. In Briarwood, music was outlawed, but Toby secretly kept a small music box for his own amusement. Upon being caught by Necrolai, he was to be taken to the mines. Hearing him plead for help, Nick led the other Rangers to fight back. This convinced the Tribunal of Magic to reverse Imperious' wish, thus restoring the Rangers' powers. In \\"The Light,\\" Toby seemed suspicious of his employees' disappearance; therefore he hired Leelee to fill in their place. In \\"Light Source\\" Pt. 2, the Rangers were finally ready to tell him their secret. However, when he asked them to morph as proof, they explained that a powerful villain called Hekatoid had stolen their powers, which he disbelieved. According to him, the 'real' Power Rangers would handle the situation, thus once again helping the Rangers without realizing it. Ultimately, he did happen to see them morph after they regained their powers. By \\"The Return\\", he had complete knowledge of the Rangers' task. Later, Toby hires Phineas to work in his shop which proves disastrous when customers are frightened by Phineas' appearance. Toby reluctantly dismisses Phineas to keep his business intact. During the final battle, Toby had convinced the humans of Briarwood that the spirits of the nearby forest were not their enemy, and that the two populations shared a common foe; this being the Master of the Underworld. The faith of the two populations in the Power Rangers re-created the Rangers' magic, which had been nearly destroyed, enabling them to overwhelm and annihilate the Master. After the battle, Toby rehired Phineas and hired a revived Matoomba and several other spirits to work in his shop. He also began dating the reformed (and now human-looking) Necrolai. In the Power Rangers: Operation Overdrive episode \\"At All Cost,\\" Toby was referenced as the record-store owner who sold the dragon scale from Fire Heart to Andrew Hartford for use with the Defender Vest. Toby is portrayed by Barnie Duncan. =Phineas= Phineas is a Troblin (a half-troll, half-goblin creature) who roams the woods outside of Briarwood in the magical realm where he was rejected by humans, spirits, and even the trolls and goblins. He first appeared saving Clare from the Hydra Worm and later met Nick, whose friend he became. It was Phineas who told Nick that Necrolai and Koragg serve an even greater evil called the Supreme Master of the Underworld. Phineas befriended the other Rangers when Nick and Catastros were trapped in another dimension and later helped all the Rangers on their quest for the Fire Heart, during which he displayed impressive acrobatic skills. In the episode \\"Scaredy Cat,\\" Phineas is taken to a human dentist so as to have his teeth attended. He was escorted by Toby who believed that Phineas was \\"Xander's uncle from the Old Country\\". At the dentist's office, Phineas is revealed to have eighty-three teeth of which not all of those teeth are his. Phineas was later escorted to the Rock Porium by Toby, where became a fan of rock music after hearing it for the first time. Phineas is a little clumsy and has a dry sense of humor, but is quite cunning. Whereas Phineas' origins and early history are not entirely known, he seems to have a strong connection with the Mystics and the Great Battle. He has told Clare that he was present during the war between the Mystics and the forces of the Underworld and personally witnessed Calindor's betrayal of Daggeron; later, in Ranger Down, Phineas admitted to Daggeron and Udonna that, during Daggeron and Calindor's battle, he took Udonna's baby Bowen to the human realm for safety. In \\"Dark Wish,\\" Phineas found Koragg insensate after the latter was defeated by Fightoe and 50-Below. Phineas seemed to have a little respect for the dark knight, which he showed by attempting to give him a eulogy (Even someone bad had a redeeming quality, such as Koragg's honor, it's the right thing to do to try honoring their memory with a speech). He was about to take Koragg's Wolf Saber when the knight, revealed to be alive, woke and frightened him. Koragg, too injured to save himself, asked Phineas for help, to which the half-breed reluctantly agreed. When Imperious used Jenji to create a world wherein the Power Rangers did not exist, it created a new timeline wherein Koragg and Phineas were allies. Koragg was aware of the legend of the five Mystic Warriors, of which he told Phineas. When Koragg sent the Rangers to the dimension where the Tribunal of Magic could be found, he broke his alliance with Phineas, who seemed saddened to say goodbye to his \\"friend\\". Later, after the Ten Terrors had revealed themselves to the surface world, it was Phineas who revealed to Nick that he was the being known as \\"The Light\\", the son of the mightiest Mystics, who had the potential to single-handedly vanquish evil. In \\"The Hunter\\" just as Oculous was about to open fire on Nick, Phineas saved the Ranger from an oncoming bullet and convinced him to not give himself up, based on the premise that all life would be lost if the Light should fall. In the episode \\"Light Source\\", Phineas met Leelee, with whose outcast status he sympathized. During their conversation, Leelee decided that she would rescue Udonna, who had been captured by Hekatoid; Phineas decided that he would tag along. On their way, they encountered Clare, who achieved common ground with Leelee and joined the rescue effort. The three of them infiltrated the cave where Udonna was held and freed her from Hekatoid's entrapments. Before they could free her, they were surrounded by foot soldiers; Phineas singlehandedly defeated these, revealing in its use his prodigious strength, which is implied to have been the cause of Leelee's infatuation with him. Because Udonna was in a catatonic state, the trio used the Snow Staff— stolen from the villains by Leelee— and a spell to reawaken her. At a gathering held after Hekatoid had been defeated, the three had become fast friends and rejoiced over the days' successes. In \\"The Return,\\" he came to the Rock Porium with flowers for Leelee, whose sweetheart (according to her) he had become. The Rangers then gave Phineas a (possibly temporary) job at the store, which he lost when his strange appearance frightened customers. In the final battle, Phineas gathered together the denizens of Briarwood's neighboring forest, convincing them that humans were not their enemy and that the true threat originated from the Master of the Underworld. The combined faith of the two populations re-created the Rangers' magic, which had been depleted, allowing the Rangers to overwhelm the Master of the Underworld. Phineas, among others, was later hired by the Rock Porium. Phineas is portrayed by Kelson Henderson. =Fire Heart= The Fire Heart was an item sought by both the Rangers and the villains, which the Rangers eventually found and took back to Rootcore, where Udonna revealed that it was the last Dragon egg. According to a book in Rootcore that told about dragons, it said that the baby dragon could only be hatched by forcing the egg open with a hammer; a tactic of which Clare did not approve. When Jenji was released in \\"Scaredy Cat,\\" he told the Rangers that it must be sat on to hatch. Clare did so; therefore when the dragon was released, it came to call her \\"Mama\\". She is later shown nursing him. In \\"Ranger Down,\\" Jenji took Fire Heart into the forest and abandoned him out of jealousy. Phineas eventually found him, and took care of him for a brief amount of time, even going so far as to sentimentally name him \\"Phineas Jr.\\" or \\"P.J.\\" for short. Because of Phineas' care, Fire Heart called Phineas \\"Daddy\\". When Phineas lost the dragon, he wandered the forest, looking for 'Phineas Jr.'. He ran into Clare in the process; when the two realized that they were searching for the same dragon, they looked up to see him, now grown to a massive adult size. Due to the fact that he has taken a liking to both Clare and Phineas, Fire Heart more than likely considers the two to be his parents. When Imperious used Jenji to create a world wherein the Power Rangers never came into their power, it created a new timeline wherein Koragg was the egg's discoverer and dragon's keeper. Because of the new timeline, the dragon did not recognize the Rangers and breathed fire at them when they came too close. Koragg then used a spell to calm or tame the dragon and convince him to work with the Rangers. Fire Heart was revealed to have the power to enter the Tribunal of Magic's dimension, whereupon he did so. On the way there they were attacked by Necrolai, whom Fire Heart vanquished after a fierce aerial battle. After landing the Rangers in the Tribunal's dimension, Fire Heart quickly abandoned them. When the timeline had been restored to its original continuity, Fire Heart worked with the Rangers as if nothing had been otherwise. In \\"The Hunter,\\" it is revealed that Fire Heart has the power to combine with Nick's Legend Warrior Mode to form the Red Dragon Fire Ranger. In the Power Rangers: Operation Overdrive episode At All Cost, Fire Heart is referenced by Andrew Hartford as the source of the dragon scale needed for the Defender Vest. The scale was sold to him by Toby Slambrook. Before it was augmented to the Defender Vest, Fire Heart's scale was stolen by Moltor and Volcon to make Volcon even stronger, but was reclaimed by the Rangers. =Jenji= A powerful, quick-talking, anthropomorphic cat-like genie, and the Mystic Force Rangers' mascot, Jenji is an old friend of Udonna's and of the other Mystics. Long ago, Jenji was the most powerful and popular cat in his homeland. Everyone liked him except the Cat King of the land named Rexigan. The jealous King Rexigan had a witch cast a spell over everyone making them believe Jenji had become evil and as a result, Jenji was banished. Later, Daggeron found the nomad Jenji among many riches he had found. Though Daggeron advised him against it, Jenji opened a mystical box that was actually an evil trap, almost destroying himself in the process. Daggeron saved his life by putting him inside a lamp, which changed Jenji into a wish-granting genie. A side-effect of these abilities is that Jenji is bound to the lamp, only able to roam free for two hours at a time, after which he begins to disintegrate into dust. However, it seems that Jenji can be reconstituted if returned to his lamp before disappearing completely. Daggeron used Jenji's lamp as the key element in sealing himself and Calindor within a sea cave; once the Rangers found the lamp, they broke the seal. Jenji is somewhat cowardly despite his powers and retreated from Imperious in his first appearance, though he eventually managed to overcome his fear. He has the power to grow to the same colossal size as Imperious, as well as turn into an energetic form to be used as Daggeron's finishing move, the \\"Jenji Shining Attack\\"; Maddison also used this attack when she saved him, with the normal bright light replaced with bubbles. Despite his goofy personality, Jenji is a capable fighter. He uses his claws in battle and has a technique he dubbed the \\"Super Cat Attack\\" wherein he relentlessly assaults his opponents with claws and kicks. When Calindor reappeared, Jenji tried to warn the Rangers and Udonna of Calindor's betrayal but was unable to complete the warning when Calindor dropped a pile of books on top of his lamp. Because of his past banishment, Jenji is extremely needy of affection and therefore has been jealous of Fire Heart. In \\"Ranger Down\\" in a comic scene, Jenji meets Piggy in a dumpster in a Briarwood alley whereupon Piggy states that \\"In twenty years, this place will be crawling with aliens!\\". In \\"Dark Wish,\\" the Rangers wanted to use Jenji against the Four Barbarian Beasts although Daggeron insisted that this was not to be done. When the Rangers fought Fightoe and 50-Below, Daggeron gave in and used Jenji's Shining Attack against the two monsters. However, Fightoe captured Jenji using his magic staff and brought him to the Underworld, where Imperious released him. Being a genie, Jenji was forced to grant his wish: that the Mystic Force Power Rangers never existed. This allowed the forces of darkness to conquer the world. Although Jenji's magic was powerful, it proved reversible by the Tribunal of Magic. When the world was restored, Leelee found Jenji's lamp and released him when he told her that she would receive one wish. As she contemplatively bit her nails, he warned her that she \\"shouldn't do that\\". Leelee moaned and told him that it was a \\"nervous habit\\", saying that she wished she had never started biting them. Jenji granted this at once; while Leelee's nails grew almost 6 inches long, Jenji fled to the safety of Rootcore. In \\"Hard Heads,\\" he was temporarily turned to stone when Serpentina's snakes bit him, whereupon she activated her shield. Upon Serpentina's destruction, he was returned to normal. Jenji later served as supervisor in the \\"Bound Battle\\", a duel wherein Imperious and Daggeron fought to the death. He was briefly killed by Sculpin in Mystic Fate, but returned to life along with Daggeron. Jenji is voiced by Oliver Driver. =The Tribunal of Magic= The Tribunal of Magic was a group of three powerful, cloaked beings visited by the Rangers in the \\"Dark Wish\\" trilogy, who ensure the existence of magic and reside in a separate dimension. * The red-cloaked member of the Tribunal of Magic is a male who was the most calm and comprehensive of the three. * The black-cloaked member of the Tribunal of Magic is a male who was the most hotheaded. * The white-cloaked member of the Tribunal of Magic is a female who was the most compassionate, but was also inquisitive. The Rangers begged the Tribunal to reverse Imperious' wish and restore color and positive magic to the world. The Tribunal denied this request and returned the Rangers to their altered dimension. When Toby was dragged away by a group of Hidiacs and Styxoids, the Rangers attempted to help their friend and fought hopelessly against the monsters. The Tribunal of Magic then decided that this courage deserved a reward and restored the world to its former state. The Rangers, now morphed, continued to fight the Hidiacs, only to be defeated by 50-Below and Fightoe. When the Rangers realized that they had taken their magic for granted, the Tribunal of Magic decided to give the Rangers a reward and bestowed upon them the spell code for Legend Mode allowing the Mystic Rangers to become the Legend Warriors. The red Tribunal member was voiced by Michael Morrisey. The black Tribunal member was voiced by Stuart Devenie. The white Tribunal member was voiced by Elizabeth McRae. =Leelee Pimvare= Leelee Pimvare is the teenage daughter of Necrolai. Previously a frequent shopper at Rock-Porium, of which she later became an employee. While part of the Morlocks for most of the season, she has recently abandoned them for a normal life. Her father was turned into a worm by Necrolai. It is unclear if she too is a vampire, as she looks human. She has also shown to be a fairly adept fighter, perhaps even on par with her mother, though Necrolai hinted that Leelee's time amongst humans— three months as of that meeting— had made her soft. Both the fact that she was able to fight hand-to-hand with Necrolai and the fact that she is implied to have lost strength lends credit to the theory that she is a vampire, however there is the possibility that she is a Dhampir (half-human, half-vampire), which can fully explain her abilities and human appearance. Aside from these facts, she seems like the average teenage girl. Leelee may have a crush on Nick, as she has flirted with him. She often seems to be vain or obnoxious toward the Rangers. Leelee has been known to be extremely selfish and trouble-prone, as when she tried to frame Nick for theft so that he be fired from his job and would have time to spend with her. For a period, she took a more active role in the forces of darkness' plotting, such as luring Vida to Flytrap's club so that she would be turned into a vampire under Necrolai's control, aiding Morticon in his attempt to locate the Gatekeeper. Leelee seems to have an uneasy relationship with her mother, who forced her to try to enter a cave to find Imperious' mummy, although evil beings were unable to enter. In addition, when Leelee was turned into a bug by Imperious, Necrolai refused to do anything about it, and when Necrolai gained magic she also transfigured Leelee. Despite that, Leelee appears to have some degree of love for her mother and sounded upset at the thought of leaving her. She also tends to be somewhat incompetent, as in her release of Jenji and her myopic wish that she had never bitten her fingernails. In \\"Heir Apparent,\\" the Rangers were captured and discovered she was one of the members of the Forces of Darkness. She showed a desire to keep the Rangers as \\"pets\\", but also showed concern as to their condition after their powers were drained. Thereafter her mother, Necrolai, took an extreme interest in the Book of Prophecy. Leelee decided that she could no longer continue her evil ways; angling to make friends, she left the Underworld to work alongside the Rangers at the Rock Porium. Nick initially intended to tell Toby Leelee's secret, but the other Rangers stopped him. Leelee promised that as long as they kept her secret, she would keep theirs. The Rangers are extremely distrustful of her until she proves herself to be a diligent worker. In \\"The Hunter,\\" Leelee had been left to mind the store. When the Rangers returned after a battle, they found her exhausted and the Rock Porium clean. She was therefore named \\"[best] employee of the month\\". In \\"Hard Heads,\\" Leelee felt miserable and lonely; between the Rangers' distrust of her and her mother doting on the Terrors, she seemed to have no one in whom to confide. At the end of the episode, she read the Book of Prophecy, hoping that her future might cheer her up; however, she was instead horrified to discover that she would apparently become \\"Queen of the Vampires\\". In the two-part episode \\"Light Source,\\" she went up against her mother, defying her destiny to be the Vampire Queen. Leelee helped Clare and Phineas enter the Underworld to find Udonna, who was imprisoned there. They used their combined magic to set her free and energized her using the Snow Staff. Leelee was therefore finally accepted as a friend by the Power Rangers and their allies. In the later episode \\"The Return\\", Leelee confirms a rumor planted in \\"Light Source\\" that she had made Phineas her paramour. In \\"Mystic Fate,\\" her mother defected to the side of good to protect her. Afterwards, the two moved into a Briarwood condo. Phineas remained Leelee's sweetheart, though his open-hearted demeanor apparently prevents any of the then-conventional awkwardness from taking hold. While Leelee first revealed her full name in \\"Broken Spell,\\" not until \\"Light Source\\" did she point out that her surname was an anagram of \\"Vampire\\" implying that it may be an assumed name. Leelee is portrayed by Holly Shanahan. Forces of Darkness The fictional villains of Mystic Force are demonic beings that dwell underground, known as the Forces of Darkness; they were also referred to as the Morlocks in promotional material, though this reference was never made in the show. Originally, the Forces of Darkness attempted to take over the magical world with their sights set on the human realm as well. But Leanbow, the strongest wizard of those to challenge them, cast a spell to banish them into the Underworld, sealing them for all eternity in a noble sacrifice. Years later, the seal was cracked and they resumed their campaign to finish what they had started. All members of the Forces of Darkness appear in footage imported from Mystic Force's source material, the 2005 Super Sentai Mahou Sentai Magiranger, in which the characters comprise the Underground Hades Empire Infershia (albeit with different names). =Morticon= The former general and leader of the dark army, Morticon appears to be an undead cyborg, with the machinery that comprises the bulk of his body fused to what remains of his blue skin, somewhat similar to Dr. Victor Frankenstein's monster. He is known to use a mystical portal to view the world and wields a sword made from one of the Master's fangs. He possesses Herculean strength, able to hurl the Mystic Dragon (with the Mystic Phoenix riding it) with one arm with relative ease and because of his strength and skill in battle, especially with his sword, he considers himself to be the Most Powerful Warrior of All Time. He initially couldn't leave the Pit because Koragg's magic wasn't strong enough to free him, although he briefly broke through to the surface in giant form when Koragg robbed the Mystic Titans of their Megazord power and used it to free him. However, Nick quickly used a counter-spell to imprison Morticon once more. Morticon had a very short temper, he desperately wanted out of the Underworld and frequently attacked Koragg to get him out. Morticon has also been seen blasting a Styxoid into thin air, and can be very intimidating to the villainous Necrolai. He and Koragg never got along, and have gotten into fights on two occasions. He was freed again to battle the Power Rangers in \\"The Gatekeeper\\" Pt. II. He proved very powerful and was once again in his giant form when he appeared, easily defeating the Titan Megazord uses his own form of the Dark Magic Strike. He batted away the Mystic Dragon with his sword while Nick went to rescue Clare. He was eventually defeated when the Rangers formed the Titan Megazord and, with the help of Udonna, destroyed him. All that remained after that was his sword, which Koragg found and claimed for himself. Morticon was voiced by Andrew Robertt. =Imperious / Calindor = Referring to himself as the Dark Wizard of the Underworld, Imperious sees magic as a way to grant his own selfish desires. He was formerly a friend of Mystics' named Calindor, he himself one of the Mystics in the Great Battle. Fed up of following Leanbow's teachings and corrupted by dark magic, he betrayed the others and tried to take Bowen to the Underworld. He battled Daggeron over the baby, resulting in both combatants being cursed and sealed in a cave. Nineteen years later after Morticon had been destroyed, Necrolai tricked the Rangers into breaking the seal and retrieved the mummified Calindor. The Master brought him back to life as the mummy-like Imperious to serve as the new leader of the Underworld, a role Imperious took an immediate liking to. Imperious was easily annoyed by Leelee's complaining, turning her into an insect. With the ability to summon and free monsters (including himself) from the Underworld, Imperious wasn't hindered by a focus on escaping the Underworld like Morticon was, and focused more on direct attacks on the civilians of Briarwood. In \\"Long Ago,\\" Imperious briefly reassumed his previous identity as Calindor to gain Udonna and the other Rangers' trust, intending to poison Udonna, frame Daggeron as the traitor and steal the Xenotome. Luckily, Clare worked out his true nature and found out from Phineas he was the traitor just in time to stop Imperious from poisoning Udonna, and Daggeron prevented him from stealing the Xenotome and rendering the Rangers powerless. After that, he began seeing Daggeron as a personal rival. In \\"Ranger Down,\\" he dared Koragg to fight without magic, relying on only his physical strength. Koragg agreed, and his magic was turned into a purple Mystic Morpher that was given to Necrolai. Unbeknownst to Koragg, this was just the first step in a much larger plan - to destroy the Master and rule the world on his own. In the next step of Imperious' plan, he released the four Barbarian Beasts. Warmax and Shrieker were sent to battle the Rangers first, wearing them down, while he secretly dispatched both Fightoe and 50-Below to take out Koragg so he couldn't interfere. Imperious then sent them to battle the Rangers, knowing that their laziness and battle fatigue would cause them to summon Jenji - at which point Fightoe captured him and took him to the Underworld, where Imperious used Jenji's power to wish for a world where good magic and everything related to it didn't exist, rendering the Rangers powerless. This allowed the forces of darkness to conquer the world - Rootcore was reduced to rubble and the Rock Porium vanished, color was nonexistent, humanity was enslaved and music was outlawed. One thing Imperious hadn't counted on was that Koragg had survived and plotted against them, helping the Rangers to reach the Tribunal of Magic and reverse Jenji's wish, after which 50-Below was destroyed. After the battle, Imperious scolded Fightoe for fleeing from battle and destroyed his body and then used Fightoe's soul to power the war machine monster, Ursus, which was also destroyed. Imperious later attempted to convince the Master that Koragg was incompetent and a traitor in order to get rid of the warrior once more, but failed. Realizing he was unable to destroy the Master as long as Koragg was around and scared of his treachery being found out, he decided to get into the Master's good books instead by raising him out of the Underworld with the Ranger's Legend powers. To that end, he formulated a plan by separating Daggeron from the Rangers and destroying him, while using his power to create the Chimera to help drag the Rangers down into the Underworld; Udonna's interference and Koragg's transformation back into Leanbow freed the Rangers, but the Master was still rising. Imperious was on the verge of triumph when it was discovered Daggeron had in fact survived. Imperious challenged him to a bound battle - the two, in their Ancient Mystic Modes, would be chained together and fight with only swords. Imperious cheated, snatching the Solaris Laser Lamp for use and mocking the idea of fighting with honor. Despite this, Daggeron was able to win and mortally wounded his enemy. Imperious regressed back to Calindor and then into the mummified shell of himself before dissolving to dust as he made a cryptic remark about the coming of the Ten Terrors. Imperious is a skilled fighter and extremely powerful, as well as supremely arrogant. He balances out his physical strength with magical powers, which is the same kind of magic as the Mystic Rangers' only to a higher degree, and he is willing to use forbidden magic (such as to create the Chimera) and can free banished monsters. He carries around a Folding fan that he also uses as a weapon as he can use it to send magical spells and it can also become a staff that can be used in battle. He can grow to a size more than one hundred times the size of the Titan Megazord. In his first encounter, he easily defeated the Rangers, and only Jenji's surprise attack and the fact his magic hadn't yet returned to full strength (due to being stuck in the cave) drove him back. Despite his new form, he can return to being Calindor at will and use his old Ancient Mystic Mode. In his Ancient Mystic Mode, he uses a Mystic Sword similar to the one that Daggeron uses and that both used during their final duel, and was able to fight him evenly matched, showing that he hadn't forgotten any of his old fighting skills. Calindor was portrayed by Will Hall while Imperious was voiced by Stuart Devenie. =Koragg the Knight Wolf= Koragg the Knight Wolf is an armored wolf-themed warrior that is loyal to the Supreme Master of the Underworld. He is somewhat similar to the werewolf and the person who serves as his host has a Jekyll and Hyde personality. * The first host was Leanbow. * The second host was Nick who the Supreme Master of the Underworld used to attack the local villages in the forests. Leanbow was able to exorcise Koragg from Nick. Koragg made a cameo footage in Power Rangers Beast Morphers in Making Bad. Koragg the Knight Wolf is voiced by Geoffrey Dolan, Chris Graham, & Firass Dirani. =Necrolai/Nikki= Necrolai is the Dark Mistress of the Underworld and Queen of the Vampires. This evil spy is frequently disrespected by Koragg and Morticon who constantly call her a \\"hag\\". She can fly and usually scouts the area for Morticon. Necrolai is usually the one who brings up monsters and thinks up the schemes. She is a formidable fighter in her own right and has battled the Rangers occasionally. Due to her status as Queen of the Vampires, she is not adversely affected by garlic or sunlight. She was once obliterated by the power of the Dawn Crystal, but managed to reassemble herself during a half moon later that night. Despite her early claims of immortality, she does seem to fear Morticon and, to a lesser extent, Koragg, which would explain why she puts up with their behavior and rarely talks back to them. She showed true fear when Morticon threatened her after her repeated failures against the Rangers. After Morticon was destroyed, she brought the mummy of Calindor from the cave to the Underworld, releasing Imperious. Necrolai is ambitious, callous, and egocentric; what she does, she does for her own benefit, intending to rise to a position of power. She however is a capable fighter in her own right, even holding her own against the entire Mystic Ranger team on occasion, without the assistance of magic. Much like Scorpina before her, she takes few if any hits during battle. Being afraid of Morticon, she will not seek to rise alone beyond a certain point, but attempts to raise her own status by backing the Master. Necrolai is also Leelee's mother. The father is seldom mentioned where Necrolai has claimed that she changed him into a worm. Necrolai seems to have little or no regard for her daughter, doing nothing to help Leelee after Imperious turned her into a bug. Necrolai herself transformed Leelee into a bug, testing out the purple Mystic Morpher's powers. After Morticon's demise, she had a minor panic attack over the loss of her leader and expressed to the Master that she did not trust Koragg to lead, and when Imperious arrived, she tried to flatter him into favoring her. In \\"Ranger Down\\", Necrolai received Koragg's magic in the form of a purple Mystic Morpher, but in \\"Koragg's Trial\\", Koragg took his magic back to challenge the Rangers' new Legend powers. After pleading his case to the Master, his magic was officially returned to him, and Necrolai was once again without magic. After Leanbow freed the Rangers from the Underworld, Imperious weakened him, allowing Necrolai to capture Leanbow and bring him back to the pit where he was once again turned into Koragg by the Master. After the destruction of the Pit and Imperious, Necrolai was shown having a few doubts about her current role, but the discovery of the Book of Prophecy changed all that - ignoring her daughter entirely, she followed the Book's instructions and provoked the Ten Terrors into attacking the Surface. She now appears with Gekkor on excursions to the surface world. Recently, Necrolai placed a scale on Leanbow, that was given to her by Sculpin, so that the Ten Terrors could track him down and extract the Master's essence from him. They were successful in doing just that. Necrolai seems to have an inferiority complex with regards to the Ten Terrors as well as a slight fear of them. She believes that by following their orders she will spare herself any wrath they may inflict on her by beckoning to their whim, obeying them more so out of fear than just out of respect for their rank to the Master. While Necrolai normally seems like she doesn't care about Leelee, it is revealed in \\"Mystic Fate\\" that she does care - when Itassis was told to destroy all humans by the Master, Necrolai begged her not destroy Leelee. While Itassis was willing to do so (due to Necrolai's loyalty to the Master), Sculpin demanded Leelee die with the humans as punishment for living with them. As a result, she betrayed the Master to revive Itassis, as well as the dead Leanbow, Daggeron, and Jenji. In the process, she was turned into a human. Soon after the final battle, she started dating Toby (who called her \\"Nikki\\") and both she and Leelee apparently moved into a condo. Necrolai was voiced by Donogh Rees. Nikki, her human form was portrayed by Brigitte Berger, but voiced by Donogh Rees. =Octomus= The Supreme Master of the Underworld (AKA Octomus) is the main antagonist of Mystic Force and the true leader of the Forces of Darkness and his minions revere him so much that he has only ever been referred to by his title. He contacts his minions via the white pool at the center of their lair, which turns red to signal his presence. His true form was revealed to be an immense Cthulhu-like demon with a skull-like face, many tentacles and dragon heads on the end of each tentacle, but usually only his right eye can be seen. His other eye is embedded in Koragg's shield, and one of his fangs was used to make Morticon's sword (which was taken by Koragg when Morticon was destroyed and forged into a new Knight Saber) and quite possibly some of his claws were given to Necrolai, her \\"Claws of the Master\\". He was sealed in his Pit by the efforts of Leanbow at the end of the Great War, when the Forces of Darkness attempted to invade the Surface Realm, but he was able to transform his enemy into his most loyal servant Koragg the Knight Wolf beforehand. He was also responsible for dragging Catastros down to the Underworld. With the Forces of Darkness active once more, their sole motivation is to free their Master. The Master has often had to intervene to stop his minions squabbling - in one case, Koragg was placed on trial before him, accused of being a failure to the villains' cause, and he made his verdict in Koragg's favor. He also created Imperious out of the mummified remains of Calindor. To gain the Master's favor after his attempts at usurping him had failed, Imperious proposed the idea of feeding the Ranger's Legend Warrior powers to him, giving him the power to enter the surface world. But when Udonna's interference almost got her killed by the Master himself, Koragg stopped him at the last second and was turned into Leanbow once more. The Master was able to partially emerge onto the surface before Leanbow pulled off the ultimate sacrifice, seemingly destroying himself and the Master. However, the Ten Terrors were confident that by following the Rules of Darkness, they could bring about Master' resurrection. Nevertheless, in \\"Hard Heads,\\" a monkey wrench was thrown into the Terrors' works. Sculpin learned that Leanbow, still stuck in the body of Koragg, seems to be somehow preventing the Master's resurrection from beyond the grave. Later, Sculpin located Leanbow in the Underworld, and extracted the Master's spirit, giving it to Gekkor for safe keeping. In \\"The Return,\\" the Master ultimately chose Matoombo as his vessel/egg and was restored to having a physical body by hatching & tearing his way out of Matoombo's body and starts melting & molding it into his own evil image of a skeletal fallen angel-like beast with a skull-like face, a black mask that concealed his hideous brain and numerous tentacles. He also had two additional eyes on his skull-face to replace his original right eye. In his final bid for power in \\"Mystic Fate,\\" the Master first possessed Nick Russell directly and transformed him into a new Koragg - one more sadistic and vicious, who laid waste to parts of the forest and Rootcore before he was saved. While the Rangers were distracted by this, the Master personally went to the Mystic Realm and seemingly destroyed the Mystic Mother, source of all good magic, and when Leanbow & Daggeron arrived to face him he devoured their Knight powers and killed them. Following this, he personally went to Briarwood and attacked the Rangers directly, hurling them into a vision of the future where he had succeeded in destroying the Earth before devastating the Manticore Megazord, devouring part of their magic, and sending the Rangers fleeing. His victory seemed certain - Nick was able to wound him and have the Rangers sent back to the real world, but at the cost of their magic. However, the Master was undone when it was revealed Itassis & Necrolai had defected from him (causing the resurrection of Daggeron & Leanbow), the Mystic Mother was still alive and both the people of Briarwood and the forest had gathered against him. Regaining their magic from people's belief in them, the Mystic Force Rangers used the Master's devouring of good magic against him by overloading him and causing his destruction. The Master was voiced by John Leigh in his second form (he never spoke in his original form). =The Ten Terrors= The Ten Terrors of the Underworld are a Pantheon of ten god-like demons/monsters and the most powerful servants of the Master. They supposedly only existed in the worst of nightmares but were discovered by Necrolai in The Light, dwelling in the Lower Sanctum of the Underworld. They are all normally giant in size, especially in their lair but they can change their size at will to match the height of the Rangers. They are adamant about upholding the Laws of Darkness and are willing to kill each other (and be killed) for transgressing them; it appears that if they don't follow the Rules, there will be dire consequences for them and they may be banished. Their cardinal law is that those who oppose dark magic are to be punished. They appeared on Earth to demonstrate their power and announce themselves. They each wield a different kind of weapon. In their lair stands a giant stone monolith known as the Stone of Judgment which projects a ball of light that passes over the Ten Terrors, stopping on the weapon of whoever is chosen to punish Earth next, however, in the first part of Mystic Fate the Stone of Judgment is destroyed when The Master used it as a portal into the Underworld, causing it to shatter. They wait for their Master's return and resurrection. Although they easily decimated the Rangers and their Megazords in their first appearance, the Terrors were less successful in individual attacks on the surface world. Nearly all of the Terrors were destroyed, the only Terrors that survived were Itassis and Matoombo as they both eventually defected to the side of good, (although both of them were destroyed at one time, Matoombo was destroyed when Sculpin struck him down and the Master was reborn & hatched in his body and Itassis was slain by the combined strengths of Black Lance and Sculpin). Magma Magma was the first of the Ten Terrors chosen to fight the Mystic Force Power Rangers while Udonna left to find Leanbow. He was an Ifrit (a type of fire genie) who used a club with a ball and chain as his weapon. He shoot out fire from his club, and fire out a spiral blast form fire form his chest. For defense, he can create a shield of heat that can stop almost anything but water-based attacks, although he's durable enough survive the Rangers' Legendary Warriors United Formation attack. When he was sent to punish humans on the surface, he lit a radio tower to show how much time the people had left before he punished them with an attack called \\"Volcanic Force\\". He offered to play a game with the Rangers, lighting another radio tower on fire and saying that if even one Ranger was left standing when the tower burned down, the Rangers would win. Magma beat the Rangers fairly easily, but Madison's passion of wanting to save the people of earth compelled her to use a powerful Tidal Wave attack, causing Magma pain due to weakness of water. Out of anger Magma grew to giant size to battle the megazords. He was unaffected by the Manticore Megazord's Striker Spin Attack in this giant form, but as he was about to pummel the Rangers, the other Terrors noticed that the tower had burned out; Magma had lost the game. Sculpin threw his trident at Magma, destroying him. In his dying breath, Magma foreshadowed the challenges the Rangers had to face with the Ten Terrors before he was turned to stone and was destroyed. Magma was voiced by Greg Smith. Oculous A red-eyed robotic Cyclops, Oculous is the sharpshooter of the Ten Terrors and is known as the \\"Cunning Hunter\\". He used a sniper rifle with a bayonet as his weapon. When Necrolai first entered the lower sanctum where the Ten Terrors dwelled, he was on the verge of firing on her with his sniper rifle, calling her an \\"eyesore\\", before Gekkor intervened. He possesses the power to demolecularise whatever he shoots at and can access another dimension from which he can fire at any target he wants wherever it is. In \\"The Hunter,\\" he became the second Terror chosen by the Stone of Judgment to challenge the Rangers, offering to spare their lives if they sacrificed Nick, The Light. The Rangers refused and attempted to escape, but Oculous easily took out Vida, Chip, Xander and Madison from his other dimension, leaving Nick wounded and desperate. When Phineas told Nick to look into his \\"heart\\", Nick summoned Fire Heart and combined with him, summoning the Mystic Battlizer and becoming the Red Dragon Fire Ranger. Nick defeated numerous Hidiacs & Styxoids before firing at Oculous, destroying him, and making his friends rematerialized. Oculous was voiced by Andrew Laing. Serpentina Serpentina is a Gorgon monster with a mirror-coated shield (similar to the Aegis of Athena) for a weapon, which can deflect almost any attack. She is one of the two female terrors, and the slyest of the ten. She speaks in a hissing lisp. She has the ability to morph her lower body in a more serpentine shape (similar to a Nāga) and can shoot purple electricity from her mouth, a technique she calls the \\"Snake Strike\\". She also has the ability to send her enemies to her stomach, and the ability to transform herself into a giant snake and can summon many snakes (her \\"children\\") and when a victim is bitten by her snakes, she can activate her shield causing all who have been bitten to turn to stone. In \\"The Light,\\" she openly said that the Master was growing incompetent. She also seems to not care whether the Master is revived and agreed with Megahorn, both were annoyed that the Terrors should follow the Rules of Darkness according to the Stone of Judgment. In \\"Hard Heads,\\" she was the third to be chosen by the Stone of Judgment to face the Power Rangers. She had peered into the Book of Prophecy and realized it was her turn to be chosen, and so tricked Hekatoid to attack before her so that he would be able to get rid of the Rangers before she had to punish the humans. Although she scold Hekatoid for his failure, he did manage to cast a spell on Nick and Vida that caused them to lose their ability to morph, giving the team a disadvantage. On her first appearance on the surface world, she fought Daggeron and the three remaining Rangers, who were forced into their Titan forms, due to Nick and Vida's inability to morph. Nick and Vida used a spell to knock her off balance, and Serpentina attempted to attack them when the other Rangers came to their aid. When Daggeron attempted to use Jenji's Shining Attack, Serpentina managed to get one of her snakes to bite Jenji and then activated her shield, turning Jenji to stone. She then challenged the Rangers by inviting them into her Serpent Dimension where she proceeded to swallow them in her giant snake form. She returned to the human world and set her sights on finishing the job by consuming Nick and Vida while they were still vulnerable, until Itassis intervened, reversing Hekatoid's spell on them. Nick then defeated Serpentina with his Battilizer, causing Serpentina to regurgitate the other Rangers. She then grew into her giant form and summoned her snakes all over Briarwood, but before any of them could bite, Daggeron used the Solar Streak Megazord's furnace blast to suck up Serpentina's shield, causing all of her snakes to vanish. The Rangers then destroyed Serpentina. In her last breath, Serpentina warned the Rangers that Megahorn would avenge her destruction before falling and exploding. Because of her destruction, the spell on Jenji was lifted and he was returned to normal. Serpentina was voiced by Sally Stockwell. Megahorn Megahorn is one of the least willing to obey the rules and the most short-tempered. He also looks very similar to a European dragon creature. He has an extendable neck and wings and bonelike armor equipped with what appear to be dragon skulls. While flying, he can fly as fast as the Mystic Dragon. He also wields a jagged sword which looks much like a dragon's tail. Despite Sculpin being the leader, Megahorn is the most powerful of the Ten Terrors and boasts the strongest attack and defense potential among them. By slashing his sword, he is able to create shockwaves or summon green fireballs (his fireballs can defeat the Manticore Megazord in one blast). He also can summon strange black and purple spheres of dark energy. One of his most powerful attacks is the \\"Lizard Laser\\", where he blows a powerful blast of green fire from his mouth, and can also breathe powerful blasts of fire or fireballs. During this attack, he fires green lasers from his eyes strong enough to defeat the Solar Streak Megazord. Also, his armor is incredibly durable, able to withstand Daggeron's Ancient Mystic Mode's power, the Maniticore Megazord's Striker Spin attack, and even when the rangers were in Legend Mode and combined their powers with Snow Prince they couldn't hurt him. His armor isn't completely impenetrable, however, an area on the back of his neck was less durable than the rest of his body so it proved to be a weak spot that would lead to his downfall. He, along with Serpentina, felt annoyed that the Terrors should follow the Rules of Darkness according to the Stone of Judgment. Believing that the Terrors should destroy their enemies at all costs, he is often frustrated by the Stone not picking him yet. He broke the Rules of Darkness once already in \\"The Hunter.\\" Secretly going up to the surface without being chosen, he fought against Daggeron, who had been busy training with Jenji. He nearly succeeded in destroying Daggeron before Itassis intervened and forced him to leave. Still, Megahorn vowed that he will face the Solaris Knight again. At the end of \\"Hard Heads,\\" Serpentina claimed that Megahorn would avenge her defeat. In \\"The Snow Prince,\\" Megahorn was at last selected by the Stone of Judgment to attack the Surface World. He was very impressed, even showing the arrogance to rub it in Gekkor's face. The Rangers had little success against him when they fought him at first but Nick managed to reveal a weak spot on the back of his neck when he repeatedly attacked him. Megahorn, however, was able to revert the Rangers from Titan form and Ranger form altogether and prepared to finish them off when the Snow Prince appeared and battled him. Surprisingly, even outside of his dimension the Snow Prince managed hold his own with Megahorn, though the dragon eventually overpowered him. The Snow Prince then transported Megahorn into his dimension and he, along with the Rangers, battled him amongst the snowy plains. Daggeron, however, was excluded because the Snow Prince did not feel he had learned what he needed to know. Megahorn, however, still could not be defeated, easily and defeated the Rangers once again, along with the Snow Prince, and broke free from the Snow Prince's dimension. This was when Daggeron arrived and battled Megahorn himself, repeatedly attacking Megahorn in both his Ranger form (Solaris Knight) and his Ancient Mystic Mode in the same fashion as Nick did. He managed to rediscover Megahorn's weak point, on the back of his neck, and targeted that area and temporarily defeated Megahorn. This did not stop the dragon-like Terror, however, and he grew to giant size to battle the Rangers once more. It was at this time Sculpin sent Black Lance to assist him since he believed two Terrors would be far more successful than one (and it was secretly to draw Leanbow out) much to Megahorn's dismay, thinking he could handle the Rangers on his own. Black Lance was sent back to the Underworld by Leanbow and Daggeron continued fighting Megahorn in the Solar Streak Megazord. Then by holding Megahorn in place, the Manticore Megazord had the perfect opportunity to strike the back of Megahorn's neck, weakening him enough for Daggeron to finally finish him off by using the Furnace Blast to suck Megahorn in the Megazord's engine and destroy him. Although Megahorn never got along very well with the other Terrors save for Serpentina to some degree, they were shocked that the Rangers were able to defeat him. Megahorn was voiced by Dallas Barnett. Hekatoid Hekatoid is a gluttonous, turquoise toad monster that wields a hammer that also functions as a trumpet. When Necrolai first met the Ten Terrors, Hekatoid used the trumpet function of his hammer to blow her away. He speaks in a deep, wheezing voice, however, his voice is nowhere near as dark as that of Matoombo. He loves to eat, especially dessert foods such as cakes, pies and donuts and he keeps a large table filled with these items in his personal lair. He is the shortest and fattest of the Ten Terrors. He also enjoys playing games with his opponents. By squeezing his warts, he can squirt various kinds of slime, one brand acts like an acid that is strong enough to dissolve concrete, another can prevent whichever of the Rangers it touches from morphing. He also has the ability to spit large gobs of explosive oily sludge at his enemies and can extend his tongue like a real frog to ensnare his enemies. He also has the ability to conjure huge clouds containing Poisonous Tadpole (his \\"babies\\") that would eventually hatch and become Poisonous Frogs, and can also summon evil, black-necked doppelgangers of the Mystic Force Rangers themselves during one of his games. He is easily the weakest of the Terrors, possessing horribly weak stamina (Black Lance noted that he was out of shape), and is easily injured by any attacks the Rangers use. In \\"Hard Heads,\\" Hekatoid was scared of snakes. He was tricked into fighting the Rangers by Serpentina since she knew that it would be her turn to be chosen by the Stone of Judgment. He battled Nick and Vida and squirted them with a special slime by squeezing one of his warts, making them unable to morph. However, when the Selection Ceremony to choose Serpentina was underway, he was forced to retreat, return to the lair and will finish them later. Itassis briefly scold him and was able to pry the information that Hekatoid was sent by Serpentina to give her an advantage in the next battle and stated that Seprentina made him do it when give a load of panic. During \\"Snow Prince,\\" he continually expressed his concern about how the Terrors that were dispatched seemed to have a disadvantage against the Rangers and was amazed that Megahorn was defeated. At the end of Snow Prince he found Udonna and Clare at the Lake of Lament and attacked them, knocking Clare unconscious then using his long frog tongue to capture Udonna. In \\"Light Source,\\" he was the fifth chosen by the Stone of Judgment to attack the surface world. When Hekatoid was chosen, he disliked and complained about having to work when he's pissed, and Matoombo scolded him because of his gluttonous and sloppy habits. Black Lance expressed some concerns that he felt that Hekatoid was not ready because he was greatly out of shape. Hekatoid planned to lure the Rangers to him using the captured Udonna as bait. He challenged the Rangers to a game where they had to battle a large group of Styxoids and Hidiacs within a time limit, which they succeeded in doing. Next he sent them off to fight evil versions of themselves. When the Blue and Yellow Rangers were victorious, the Rangers got to fight Hekatoid himself to reclaim Udonna, but he refused to give up Udonna so easily and their battle took them from Hekatoid's lair back up to the surface. When it seemed that the Rangers finally got Udonna from Hekatoid's grasp, he used one of his sludge balls to send her away again. He also used his power to steal the Ranger's ability to morph, then fled back to his lair. Once there Hekatoid found out that Daggeron and Jenji were using the Solar Streak Megazord to suck up the Poisonous Tadpole eggs in the sky and went back to fight them as a giant. The Solar Streak Megazord used so much power in sucking up the eggs that it didn't have enough power to fight Hekatoid, and so, Hekatoid battled Daggeron on foot. By this time the tadpoles had matured into frogs and began raining down from the sky, but before they could reach the ground, the newly revived Udonna as the White Mystic Ranger used her ice magic to freeze and vaporize the frogs. Knowing Hekatoid was out of shape, the Rangers used their agility and endurance to tire out the toad and take back their Ranger powers. When their powers were returned, Udonna and the Rangers combined their magic to finally destroy Hekatoid. Hekatoid was voiced by Charlie McDermott. Gekkor A spear-wielding Wyvern creature that wears a visor, Gekkor stopped Oculous from shooting Necrolai with his rifle, willing to lend her an ear. He was also with her on the surface, watching the battle between Magma and the Rangers. Gekkor seems to be the fastest of the Terrors, able to move at lightning speed in battle. Utilising his speed, he was able to overwhelm all the Power Rangers plus Solaris Knight together. He is also able to shoot a barrage of needle-like projectiles and summon forth fiery green energy blasts from his spear. He was the first to mention that the Master was going to return. When Oculous was chosen to be the next to attack by the Stone of Judgment, Gekkor was curious (and seemed somewhat annoyed) that he himself was not chosen to carry out the punishment and was reminded by Matoombo that the Stone of Judgment is never wrong. In The Snow Prince, when Megahorn was selected by the Stone of Judgment to attack the surface, the dragon-like terror boasted proudly about him being chosen and rubbed Gekkor's face in it, to which the wyvern scoffing replied: \\"Whatever!\\" In \\"Light Source,\\" Sculpin took Gekkor and Matoombo with him to get the Master's spirit from Leanbow. Gekkor battled Leanbow, using his lightning speed to his advantage against the knight. However, Leanbow was able to severely injury Gekkor by striking him in the stomach with his sword then using a fire attack on him. Gekkor claimed that he still could fight but Sculpin stopped him and ordered Matoombo to fight. Gekkor was irritated and jealous that Matoombo got to fight Leanbow. When Sculpin extracted the Master's spirit from Leanbow's body, Sculpin gave Gekkor his spirit to take care of. In \\"The Return,\\" Gekkor was the most zealous in punishing the traitorous Matoombo and so he was dispatched to deal with Matoombo, who managed to elude him with the help of Vida and Xander. Gekkor was desperate in his chase, following Vida and Matoombo on board the Solar Streak Megazord and into the Dawn Woods, demonstrating his great speed. However, when he finally caught up with Xander and Matoombo, it turned out that Vida transformed into Matoombo to distract the wyvern-like Terror. Gekkor fought the six main Rangers and nearly swiftly defeating them with a large sphere of green energy, his full power, at them, almost assuring a \\"Sweet\\" victory. However, Gekkor was finally killed by the restored Leanbow as the Wolf Warrior with a Blazing Storm Slash. This made him the seventh Terror to be destroyed and the sixth to be destroyed by the Rangers. He was also the first Terror to be destroyed by the Rangers before being chosen to do so by the Stone of Judgment. Gekkor made a cameo in the footage in Power Rangers Beast Morphers in Making Bad. Gekkor was voiced by Mark Ferguson. Matoombo A powerful green-skinned titan gladiator with gray armor who has an afro-like hairdo and no visible eyes. He had an extremely deep voice. Matoombo referred to himself as the \\"Energy Warrior of the Underworld\\" and initially boasted of conquering the world. He wields a double-bladed staff and is the tallest of the Terrors. He is also one of the most physically strong, able to battle Leanbow and give him a challenge, as well as being able to break his shield and is formidable with his staff, able to defeat both the Titan and Solar Streak Megazords with only a one stroke. In Light Source, Matoombo scolded Hekatoid for being such a slob and a glutton after he complained about being chosen by the Stone of Judgment. When Necrolai found Leanbow in the Underworld, Matoombo, along with Sculpin and Gekkor, went to seek out Leanbow to recapture the Master's spirit that Leanbow held within him. After Gekkor fought against Leanbow for a bit, Sculpin ordered Matoombo to fight him. Matoombo's strength was enough to give Leanbow a challenge, the Titan was even able to shatter Leanbow's shield with his staff, leaving him open for Sculpin to extract the Master's spirit from his body. In \\"The Return,\\" Matoombo was the sixth Terror chosen to face the Rangers, and made it clear that he didn't actually want to harm anyone, apparently not realising, until then, that conquering the Earth would hurt people. He initially gathered up electricity to use against the Earth before realizing it. After watching him save a child from being hit by a car, Vida befriended him and convinced him to call off his attacks, and the electricity he gathered. Unfortunately by this point, Matoombo had also been chosen as the new body for the Master, and Gekkor was sent to retrieve him. This led to a protracted chase to an alternate dimension, where Vida (joined by Xander) managed to distract Gekkor long enough for Matoombo to reach the Sleeping Lake where he would slumber eternally, and thus prevent the return of the Master. Unfortunately however, before he could enter the lake, Sculpin appeared and struck him with his spear, thus allowing the Master to reassume a physical form, which he did by growing, breaking & hatching through & from Matoombo's body, and was melted. At the end of \\"Mystic Fate,\\" Matoombo was somehow revived and was last seen assisting Vida with DJing at the Rock Porium during the victory party. Matoombo was voiced by Cameron Rhodes. Itassis Itassis is a Sphinx monster with eyeglasses and an arm-mounted bazooka in the shape of a lion's head. She's a very skilled hand-to-hand fighter, and her bazooka has immense power. The wisest of the ten and working for the Master in pursuit of knowledge rather than power, Itassis makes sure the other Terrors follow the Rules of Darkness - she was the one who stopped Megahorn from destroying Daggeron in order for him not to disrupt the Rules of Darkness. She also was the one who reversed Hekatoid's spell on Nick and Vida that prevented them from being able to morph so that Serpentina would follow the rules. In \\"Snow Prince,\\" she expressed surprise and concern when Sculpin began to break the Rules of Darkness himself by sending Black Lance to help Megahorn on the surface. Unlike the other Terrors and the Master, Itassis prefers peaceful means to end conflicts and hers is the way of knowledge. In \\"The Return,\\" Itassis expressed surprise at the situation between Matoombo and the Rangers. After Vida escaped on the Solar Streak, she made a deal with the Rangers to assist them in return for knowledge - the answer to how, though the Terrors were stronger, the Rangers managed to defeat them time after time. The answer given was their courage, which led them to keep fighting for the sake of others, and she expressed confusion over why anyone would fight to defend a weaker being. When the Master chose Itassis to destroy the Rangers, she displayed great power in easily defeating the team, including Nick as the Red Dragonfire Ranger, but was confronted by Madison and Nick that she was just a puppet of the Master. She realizes that the Master had been using her and changed sides. However, Black Lance and Sculpin defeat and destroy her after she declares that she will not serve Evil any more. In the end, Necrolai revives Itassis (since she was the only kind to her) and she finally defeats Sculpin. Proclaiming to the Master that \\"this puppet has cut the strings\\", she manages to weaken him and send him retreating. She also witnesses the destruction of the Master by the Rangers. Afterwards, she turns good and expresses to Daggeron that she is interested in learning more about courage. Itassis was voiced by Josephine Daviso. Black Lance Black Lance is a black knight-like monster (inspired by the legendary horse Sleipnir, evident because his breastplate resembles a horse's head) with a shield and lance and sometimes uses a thin, jagged sword instead of his lance. He also has a Chariot that he rides into battle with that is pulled by horses that appear to be smaller and differently colored versions of Catastros. He is also one of the most powerful of the Terrors, boasting incredible offensive power, able to defeat the Manticore Megazord with one stroke of his lance and also seems to be one of the fastest when he is riding his chariot, he can also shoot lighting from his lance. He has another attack when he leaps into the air and spins around like a screw and drives towards his enemies. His shield is also nearly indestructible. Black Lance seems to act as a war advisor to Sculpin, as well as his right-hand man. When the Rangers attacked the Ten Terrors with the Manticore Megazord, Black Lance blocked the attack with his shield, then countered with his lance, easily defeating them. In \\"Snow Prince,\\" Sculpin broke the Rules of Darkness and ordered Black Lance to go to the surface world in order to help Megahorn battle the Rangers. Black Lance was delighted, saying that his stallions needed a little exercise despite Megahorn not wanting his help. Black Lance attacked the Manticore Megazord using his chariot. When it seemed that Black Lance would emerge victorious, Leanbow arrived in the form of Koragg's Knight Wolf Centaur and began attacking Black Lance. The knight accused the former Koragg of being a traitor and used the spikes on the wheels of his chariot to injure him. Leanbow then leapt onto Black Lance's chariot and used his sword to smash one of its wheels, causing the chariot to crash and break and flinging Black Lance away. Black Lance then battled Leanbow as the Centaurus Wolf Megazord, during this time Necrolai planted Sculpin's fish scale on one of the wolf figureheads on his right shoulder. Leanbow then overpowered Black Lance and used a teleportation spell to drag Black Lance down into the Underworld, where the Knight-like terror vowed that he would get his revenge on Leanbow. In \\"Light Source,\\" he expressed concern about Hekatoid being sent to fight since he was out of shape. In the finale, Black Lance assisted Sculpin in destroying Itassis for her betrayal. Then with a new chariot, Black Lance began attacking the surface world and soon began fighting the Manticore Megazord overwhelming it again. He appeared on the verge of victory before Nick, backed up with Fire Heart to form the Red Dragon Fire Ranger, beat him back, and the Rangers soon used their version of the Mystic Spell Seal to finish off Black Lance for good, making him the seventh and final Terror destroyed by the Rangers. Black Lance was also the first Power Rangers monster to battle their Megazords more than once and never lose. Black Lance was voiced by Derek Judge. Sculpin Lord Sculpin is the red fish man-like leader of the Ten Terrors with a trident for a weapon. His appearance is similar to both the Gill-man and Dagon and he has a fish for a head. Being the leader, Sculpin is most likely the most powerful of all the Terrors, his trident is an efficient weapon, able to strike down Magma, Matoombo and Itassis with it easily and can summon a flurry of fireballs from his trident when fighting. He also has the ability to shed his fish scales and use them as tracking devices. He is fanatically loyal to the Master, and doesn't even view it as his place to question orders. When Magma failed to destroy the Rangers before the flame he lit burnt out, Sculpin hurled his trident through the portal created by the Stone of Judgment and destroyed Magma. He is extremely zealous about upholding the Rules of Darkness and has made it clear he will destroy anyone who breaks them, although this only because he thought following them would allow the Master to return. When he noticed that the Master showed no signs of returning, he became suspicious and went to investigate. He scried using the Lake of Lament to find out what happened to the Master. He realized that Leanbow was preventing the Master from being resurrected. Although this was a major hindrance to the Terrors' plans, Sculpin found the aspect \\"fun\\". He then plotted ways to lure Leanbow out in the open. He went back to the Lake of Lement and called Leanbow and showed him Megahorn's rampage and how strong he was against the Rangers. When Leanbow refused to help, Sculpin resorted to drastic measures. He deliberately broke the Rules of Darkness by sending Black Lance to the surface in order to assist Megahorn, feeling that two Terrors were far more difficult to handle than one. This strategy proved successful when Leanbow did appear on the Surface World. It was then that Sculpin gave Necrolai one of his fish scales to plant on Leanbow when he was battling Black Lance as the Centaurus Wolf Megazord. After Black Lance was sent back to the Underworld and Megahorn was destroyed, he expressed that Megahorn was a \\"Hot-head that deserved to lose,\\" then proceeded with his next plan to find Leanbow. In \\"Light Source,\\" Sculpin gave Necrolai another one of his fish scales for her (and them) to use to track down Leanbow. When she found him, he brought along Gekkor and Matoombo with him to personally battle Leanbow. He first allowed Gekkor to fight the knight but when Gekkor was weakened, he order Gekkor to stop fighting and then sent Matoombo to take his place. After Matoombo shattered Leanbow's shield, this left him open for Sculpin to use his trident to extract the Master's spirit from Leanbow's body. Once Leanbow was \\"exorcised\\", Sculpin used his trident to create a fissure in the ground and send Leanbow plummeting into it. In \\"The Return,\\" Sculpin's immediate goal of restoring the Master was realized after he personally slew his Master's chosen vessel, Matoombo, thus restoring the Master to a physical form. In the finale, Sculpin and Black Lance destroyed Itassis for her disloyalty. Alongside Black Lance, he fought the Rangers viciously, kidnapping Udonna and temporarily killing Jenji. In the Underworld however, he was confronted by Itassis (who was brought back to life by Necrolai). The two fought but Sculpin was ultimately killed unable to stand against her new sense of courage. In his last breath, Sculpin vowed that the Master would avenge him and that the forces of darkness would be victorious. Sculpin was voiced by Peter Daube. =Hidiacs= The Hidiacs are one set of vicious zombie-like foot soldiers used by the Forces of Darkness. There is a ton of them that surround the center of the lair, in rows starting from the hole on the Earth's ground all the way down to the lair. Styxoids The Styxoids are more powerful versions of the Hidiacs used by the Forces of Darkness. They are more muscular and wear leather masks and vests and wield spears. They also possess the ability to speak and are sometimes used to command squads of Hidiacs and monsters. The ones that spoke were voiced by Nick Kemplen and Jim McLarty. =Monsters= These are the monsters used by minions of Octomus. To make a monster grow, the \\"Uthra Major, Rise Up\\" incantation must be said which then causes the monster to grow to giant size. * Troll #1 - A troll monster.

Space Congress There were big gatherings of aerospace and people called the Space Congress that started during the early days of the Space-age. In the 20th century over 1000 aerospace professionals would gather to discuss space and present technical papers, however in the early 21st century they stopped happening. There was another that was organized in 2015 but it was more modest. Before that the last one is 2012 in Coco beach FL. The 1993 Space Congress was quite large and event feature included matched suits for the organizers and mugs with logos. The motto for the 1993 Space Congress was Yesterday's vision is tomorrow's reality. One factors was that a different annual gather called the National Space Symposium became popular. In 2015 the 31st NSS was held in Colorado. In 2015 the Canaveral Council of Technical Societies hosted a Space Congress in 2015. At the Space Congress U.S. Representative Bill Posey who also held a spot on the U.S. House of Representatives space subcommittee, sent a video message to the event. Also, a former U.S. astronaut was there, the Winston Scott.  Canaveral Council of Technical Societies  The Canaveral Council of Technical Societies (CCTS) was formed in 1959 to coordinate better communication and interface among the many technical societies in the Cape Canaveral area. This led to the establishment of an annual technical conference now known as Space Congress. CCTS' first technical symposium took place in Daytona Beach on October 26–28, 1962 and was called the Canaveral Council Fall Conference. The program consisted of a get- acquainted party on Friday; technical addresses and technical workshops, a luau, a conference summary, and family activities on Saturday; and a golf tournament and fashion show on Sunday. Two years later, the CCTS held the first event called Space Congress in Cocoa Beach, Florida on April 20–22, 1964, with the theme, \\"Where Are We Going in Space?\\" Thirty-one papers were presented and three luncheon speakers, an opening speaker, and keynote speaker addressed the assemblage. Eighteen organizations from industry, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force contributed exhibits. The proceedings were published. Since 1964, all CCTS Space Congresses have been held in Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral, Florida. In 1965, the growing list of events included authors' breakfasts, a banquet, evening sessions, and an international session, an exhibitors' cocktail party, and launch area tours. By 1966, the Congress had grown to four days in length and was being held on an annual basis. In 1970, panel sessions comprised each day's morning events, and on the day after the Space Congress, an USAF aircraft static display and USAF Thunderbirds demonstration was held at Patrick Air Force Base. In 1972, special TV monitors were set up at various locations for observing the Apollo 16 moon landing and EVA. In 1974, a press room location was added and CCTS scholarship awards were given. In 1975, a youth science fair was incorporated as part of the Space Congress. In 1978, CCTS introduced another popular forum attended by the public called \\"Meet the Astronauts\\" as a standing part of the annual symposium. In 1985, the Congress added a golf tournament, and in cooperation with the Brevard Arts Council, sponsored a poster competition. The last week- long Space Congress was held in 1994. Since that time, Space Congress has been largely inactive. In 2012, CCTS sponsored a single-day Space Congress that featured technical briefings at the Florida Solar Energy Center in Cocoa, Florida. This event was well received and provided the necessary local interest for CCTS to begin planning for annual Space Congress events starting in 2014.

In addition to this setting the novel employs a magic system based on Sipstrassi or stones of power, which are golden meteors which allow one to heal oneself, create food, and who are supposedly limited only by ones imagination, although each stone only has a certain amount of power, and as they are used black veins will appear upon the stone and grow, until eventually the Sipstrassi is coal black, and powerless. However, by feeding Sipstrassi blood one can refill them, although Sipstrassi refilled in this manner become blood red, incapable of healing or producing feed, good only for combat. Additionally blood Sipstrassi inspire darker feelings such as lust, greed, and rage in their wielders. Critical reception Current critical reception of Wolf in Shadow is largely positive with the book rating Goodreads assigning an average rating of 4.1 with 1291 ratings(as of the 1st of March 2012). A similar score of 8.3/10 is given on the website fantasy book review. However, in the foreword of The Last Guardian Gemmell mentions that while most reviews were either very good or indifferent, one reviewer(whose name is not fully revealed beyond him having the surname Broome) greatly disliked the novel. Of his criticisms Gemmell only mentions the line \\"I dread to think of people who look up to men like Jon Shannow.\\". This review in particular led to the introduction of a character Josiah Broome in subsequent novels, who allowed Gemmell to show a contrast between Shannow, a man unhesitating in using force to combat what he saw as evil, and Broome a man who regarded the use of force as an evil unto itself.

It was released on February 26, 2013, by eOne Music, his first album for the label. Bilal recorded the album in five months in sessions at studios in Brooklyn, Clifton, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. He was joined by most of the recording crew from his 2010 album Airtight's Revenge, including producer Shafiq Husayn, drummer Steve McKie, and pianist Robert Glasper. The singer wrote and produced most of A Love Surreal, which he titled in reference to his unreleased second album Love for Sale and John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme. A Love Surreal explores different stages of love in a cycle of slow- burning songs that Bilal wrote with female listeners in mind. The songs abandon the personal and societal themes of Airtight's Revenge in favor of lyrics about cultivating a romance and meditative laments on its dissolution. Musically, Bilal wanted to make the album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dalí for inspiration, while incorporating sounds from R&B;, funk, jazz, rock, hip hop, electronica, and psychedelic music. Bilal premiered songs from the album in his performance at World Cafe Live in Philadelphia. Its lead single \\"Back to Love\\" was released on December 11, 2012. A Love Surreal received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised Bilal's expressive singing, clever songwriting, and mellow musical style.  Background  Having written his 2010 album Airtight's Revenge with themes from a male perspective, Bilal attempted to write A Love Surreal with lyrics about love for the perspective of female listeners. He describes writing the album as a surrealistic exploration of love, inspired by the surrealism of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, having viewed a 2005 exhibit of his work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He also drew on the shelving of his unreleased album Love for Sale, which inspired A Love Surreals title. \\"For the longest I was supposed to sign with [eOne Music] and actually put Love for Sale out, but you know, things happen\\", Bilal told Okayplayer. \\"It's surreal that I'm right back at the same spot about to put out a record with them. Also, surrealthe word surrealismmy inspiration for this record.\\" Bilal had wanted to sign with eOne because of the artistic freedom the label had given fellow recording artist Dwele. The album's title was also inspired by John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.  Recording and production  Bilal used Logic software to prepare the songs he had written and proceeded to record A Love Surreal in five months, which he said was the fastest he had recorded an album. Recording sessions for the album took place at Brooklyn Recording and Breeding Grounds Studio in Brooklyn, New York; Lalabelle Music and Lamont Caldwell's Bedroom in Clifton, New Jersey; Pine Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Prime Rib Productions and The Krusty Lab in Los Angeles, California. He recorded his vocals at a beach-side studio in Los Angeles. Bilal (center right) recorded with a guitar-bass-keyboard-drum lineup. Bilal originally intended to record A Love Surreal as an extended play when he entered the studio, but, according to him, \\"it was just so easy that the music started to flow... by the fifth day we were like 'damn, we made a mistake and wrote five extra songs.'\\" He worked with most of the recording crew from Airtight's Revenge and produced 10 of the album's 14 songs. Bilal viewed that his role as a producer had progressed from his debut album 1st Born Second (2001) to A Love Surreal, which he felt best conveyed his vision for an album's sound. Bilal recorded the song \\"Butterfly\\" with Robert Glasper, a friend of his since college who had played on each of his albums. Bilal had previously worked with Glasper on the latter's 2012 album Black Radio. For the song \\"Back to Love\\", Bilal originally programmed the music's drums on his Logic, but decided to record them live after bringing in other musicians at Pine Studios in Philadelphia. While recording \\"Astray\\", he persuaded his drummer to play in the parking lot and record him live, which he recalled in an interview for The Huffington Post: \\"I just had this feeling in my head like, 'man, I want this shit to feel big!' And when I would park my car in the parking lot, the acoustics in there made you feel like was a Catholic church with all of the sounds echoing off of everything.\\"  Music and lyrics  Musically, A Love Surreal is lighter and mellower than Airtight's Revenge, while deemphasizing electronics in its production. The music is characterized by subtle melodic hooks, muted drum programming, glimmering keyboards, sparse indie rock guitars, and defined jazz piano. The songs are interspersed with long instrumental sections during which Bilal croons wordlessly, while doubling and tripling his voice. His singing veers between a soulful baritone and supple falsetto. Bilal's sense of melody and harmony is informed by past operatic and jazz training, and his reverence for atmospheric psychedelic soul albums. According to John Murph from DownBeat, Bilal's jazz-school background informs \\"his avant-soul music\\". Evan Rytlewski of Paste observes unconventional applications of jazz throughout A Love Surreal, but characterizes it foremost as a neo soul album due to its \\"heady, post-Dilla hip-hop thump and periodic psychedelic drift\\". Q calls the music \\"cosmic R&B;\\". According to SoulTracks writer L. Michael Gipson, \\"the material is often jazz, funk, rock, hip hop, electronica and R&B; all at once, with funk dominating the hot chicken grease feel of several 'jam session' cuts and Bilal's Rick James meets Prince vocal approach.\\" \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"The Flow\\" feature Robert Glasper playing keyboards. A Love Surreal comprises a cycle of slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, recovery, and solace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues. The album's opening series of songs have straightforward lyrics, according to Phillip Mlynar of Spin. On \\"West Side Girl\\", Bilal flatteringly remarks on his date's shoes, backed by a bubbling funk groove. The next song, \\"Back to Love\\", draws on the music of Prince, while the jazz guitar licks of \\"Winning Hand\\" draw influence from Steely Dan. \\"Climbing\\" has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song \\"Party and Bullshit\\". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. \\"Slipping Away\\" is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song \\"Lost for Now\\", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in \\"a smile that changes everything\\" as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad \\"Butterfly\\" is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents. The album closes with lyrics about the promise of tomorrow: \\"Woke up this morning to the sound of a bluebird singing / Suddenly I knew just where to begin / Something so simple / How can it speak so loud to me?\\"  Release and reception  In anticipation of the album's release, Bilal released a free mixtape called The Retrospection through his Facebook page on December 6, 2012. \\"Back to Love\\" was released as the lead single from A Love Surreal on December 11, and on January 8, 2013, a music video for the song was released online. On February 13, Bilal performed on World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, playing music from A Love Surreal for the first time. The album was released on February 26 by eOne. A Love Surreal was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 82, based on 11 reviews. It was hailed by Exclaim! magazine's Ryan B. Patrick as \\"a breezily solid R&B;/soul affair that shows Bilal in fine form\\". AllMusic's Andy Kellman said Bilal had improved as a producer and songwriter while remaining \\"supernaturally skilled and creative\\" as a vocalist, \\"swooping, diving, wailing, and sighing, all with complete command\\". Paste magazine's Evan Rytlewski said \\"for the first time in his career, Bilal no longer sounds like an artist with entirely too much to prove; he's just a great singer, backed by great players he puts to good use on a set of sticky, deceptively inventive songs.\\" Writing for NPR, Ann Powers said A Love Surreal \\"cultivates the stratospheric vibe\\" of Coltrane's A Love Supreme while Bilal's ambition is \\"grounded in fierce intelligence and a commitment to letting stories unfold all the way to their sometimes sorrowful, sometimes orgasmic end\\". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it \\"bracingly good\\", \\"compelling music\\" that allows Bilal's \\"falsetto to bring the intimate lyrics to life\\". In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said his \\"full-fledged\\" voice \\"needs no studio aid\\" on songs that \\"tease and insinuate\\" with \\"meanderings [that] lead somewhere\\". Some reviewers were less receptive. Pitchfork journalist Jayson Greene said it is a \\"joy\\" to listen to Bilal \\"warp his voice into improbable shapes\\", but believed the music lacks any prominent melodies. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was more critical of the closing series of slow jams and \\"atmospheric clutter\\", while writing that the album's best songs \\"warrant the increased attention\\" in Bilal. Jazz critic Tom Hull gave the album a B-plus and found it \\"nice\\", but suggested it may also be too subtle.  Track listing  (co.)

The bit, sometimes depicted as the scold's bridle, uses similar mechanics to that of the common horse bit. The scolds bridle however, is almost always associated with its use on women in the early 17th century and there are very few accounts of the device as a method of torture against black slaves under that particular name. As opposed to the whip, the iron bit lacks the historic, social, and literary symbolic fame that would make information on the use of the iron bit as accessible. Its use throughout history has warranted some attention though, mostly from literary texts. Even earlier, slave narratives and publications of newspapers and magazines from the 18th century on give evidence of this device being used to torture and punish slaves. Description A website dedicated to documenting the history of slavery in the US quotes from slave trader turned abolitionist Thomas Branagan, who describes the iron bit through a \\"front and profile view of an African's head, with the mouth-piece and necklace, the hooks round which are placed to prevent an escapee when pursued in the woods, and to hinder them from laying down the head to procure rest.\\" His essay entitled, \\"The Method of Procuring Slaves on the Coast of Africa; with an account of their sufferings on the voyage, and cruel treatment in the West Indies\\", describes the iron bit as having \\"a flat iron which goes into the mouth, and so effectually keeps down the tongue, that nothing can be swallowed, not even the saliva, a passage for which is made through holes in the mouth-plate.\\" Historical evidence Several articles and newspapers mention what appears to be the iron bit, but the name of the device varies from region to region where it is used. The mask, bit, and gag all refer to this torture device, but may differ in their specific manufacturing and disciplinary purposes. An 1848 article in The North Star states that \\"dealing in slaves has become a large business: establishments are made in several places in Maryland, at which they are sold like cattle. These places of deposit are strongly built and well supplied with iron thumb-screws and gags, and ornamented with cowskins and whips, often bloody\\". A man wrote in an open letter to the editor of the Frederick Douglass Paper about an abolitionist who was demonstrating the actions of slave holders in the American South, > I recollect the horror that thrilled the hearts of the spectators, when Mr. > Gurney one evening placed on his head an iron machine of torture, which > inflicted great pain upon the slave, and an iron gag penetrated his mouth, > confining his tongue and preventing articulation. He exhibited the whips > also, and many other implements of cruelty adopted by the planters and their > agents. One newspaper advertisement from 1792 writes of a reward to be given for the capture of a runaway slave. The description of her is given that she is \\"5 feet three or 4 inches high, had on, when she went away, such clothing as negroes generally wear in the summer, and carried with her a white linen coat and jacket. She is a vile creature, and for her many crimes I punished her with an iron collar, but supposed she soon got that off.\\" Another article on the treatment of slaves by Delphine LaLaurie of Louisiana stated that \\"seven slaves were reportedly found in various parts of the residence and they were said to be in need of medical attention. Some of them were allegedly chained in uncomfortable positions and instruments of torture were said to have been found … [Specifically] iron collars with spikes or sharp edges.\\" Literary accounts Olaudah Equiano writes about the iron bit in his slave narrative, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, as \\"the iron muzzle\\". He writes that \\"the iron muzzle, thumb screws, etc. are so well known as not to need a description, and were sometimes applied for the slightest faults\\" (Equiano 112).

Overdrive Rangers The Operation Overdrive Power Rangers are a fictional team of superheroes in the television show Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, tasked with tracking down five individual jewels that fit onto Corona Aurora. Due to DNA resequencing, they have enhanced strength and intelligence as well as individual superpowers, and wield the Overdrive Trackers that serve as communicators and morphers. They are funded and run by billionaire Andrew Hartford and are based out of his mansion, located in San Angeles. =Mackenzie \\"Mack\\" Hartford= Mackenzie Hartford, short for Mack, is the Red Overdrive Ranger and \\"son\\" of Andrew Hartford. He is the only Ranger not deliberately recruited, being involved in Operation Overdrive by accident and against his father's wishes. Outgoing and enthusiastic, he was sheltered by his father for most of his life and had the desire to prove himself. Though initially believed to be genetically enhanced like the other Rangers, he is revealed late in the series to be an android. His memory is linked to the Operation Overdrive computer, so when it's infected with a virus, Mack ends up stuck repeating himself when the virus gets to him. Mack is heavily into adventure novels and other escapist fantasies, and is determined to be a Ranger; he takes failure badly, almost quitting when he failed to protect a civilian.Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \\"Weather or Not\\" He showed bravery and quick tactical thinking in his first battle and has been quickly accepted and trusted as leader by the other Rangers. He has a close relationship with the household butler Spencer. Mack misinterprets Andrew's concern over his status as a Ranger as a lack of confidence as he overheard Andrew and Spencer talking, but soon patches things up with his father as he realizes that the man simply cares about him and is worried about losing him. His \\"genetic\\" power is super strength, though it is likely that his robotic components were simply modified. At the end of the series, Mack has a final battle with Flurious and uses all of his energy to destroy him which led directly to his death. The Sentinel Knight uses the Corona Aurora to transform Mack into a human. Mack then spends his human life the way he always wanted – adventuring with his father. He and his teammates would later return in Power Rangers Super Megaforce to battle alongside other veteran Ranger teams and the Megaforce Rangers. His primary weapon is the Drive Lance and commands the Dump Driver and the Sonic Streaker Zords. He is portrayed by James Maclurcan and voiced by Nolan North in the Power Rangers: Super Legends video game. =William \\"Will\\" Aston= William \\"Will\\" Aston is the Black Overdrive Ranger. A suave and cocky spy-for-hire with a bag full of high-tech equipment, he enjoys any chance to prove his skills against sophisticated security devices. He is also a suave ladies' man, a la a younger version of James Bond, who appreciates the finer things in life. He tries to maintain a cooler-than-thou edge, making him the only Ranger not excited about Halloween, as he considered it \\"kids' stuff.\\"Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \\"Ronny on Empty\\" Used to working alone, he was initially annoyed at having to work in a team and deliberately went off on his own in the Atlantis mission, getting frustrated every time he screwed up as a result; he realized he needed the team when Mack saved his life. Will showed his corrected thinking at the idea of teamwork when trying to help Tyzonn learn the same lesson.Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \\"Just Like Me\\" His connection to the team can be seen when he struck out on his own and risked his life to rescue Ronny, who'd been captured saving him. At the end of the series, he decided to go back to being a spy, except that he will now train a team to work with. He and the other Rangers later joined forces again in Super Megaforce to help battle the Warstar Armada. His spy skills have made him a valuable asset; during the search for the Hou-ou Bird, Will pretended to defect to the side of evil in order to retrieve the Bird from Kamdor.Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \\"Both Sides Now\\" His genetic power is enhanced hearing and \\"telescopular\\" vision, his primary weapon is the Drive Slammer, and he commands the Speed and Crane Driver Zords. He later gains a new bike called the HoverTek Cycle, with a land and helicopter mode. He is portrayed by Samuell Benta and voiced by Darryl Kurylo in the Power Rangers: Super Legends video game. =Dax Lo= Dax Lo is the Blue Overdrive Ranger. A highly skilled film stuntman, he was unappreciated and ignored in his job; he tends to babble about his previous roles and compare events to films. He adores the jokes, but does not like being left without credit for his work. He is the most enthusiastic of the Overdrive team, enjoying getting to be a real superhero. He used to have a girlfriend named Mira from which he saved her from one of her henchmen, before she was revealed to be the powerful, evil Miratrix. Dax foiled her plot at the time and revealed he had suspicions about her early on, but he was nonetheless hurt by the experience. He still believes she harbors feelings for him. Dax has also shown that he understands his duties of protecting the world, but this hasn't lessened his dream of attaining a true acting career. Dax is the first to use the Transtek Armored vehicle, which he used against Miratrix, Kamdor and Moltor and their monsters. At the end of the series, Dax declared that he has had enough of stunt acting, and expressed a desire to direct instead. He would later return in Super Megaforce alongside his teammates to help battle the Warstar Armada as part of the Ranger army. His genetic power is super agility (allowing him to jump great heights and at high speeds), his primary weapon is the Drive Vortex, and he commands the Gyro and Cement Driver Zords. He is portrayed by Gareth Yuen. =Veronica \\"Ronny\\" Robinson= Veronica \\"Ronny\\" Robinson is the Yellow Overdrive Ranger. She is a top race car driver in a male dominated field, and can hold her own when dealing with the boys. She occasionally shows a tendency to get highly competitive; she annoyed the other Rangers by repeatedly showing off when beating them at games, and had to be taught that winning isn't everything. She shows extreme joy when faced with the vehicles the Overdrive team will use and attempts to act as driver as much as possible; when exploring areas once morphed, she can be extremely excitable. Ronny is also the usual driver of the SHARC, the Rangers' primary mode of transportation. Although she is one of the toughest fighters on the team, she often serves the damsel in distress role. For example, in \\"Man of Mercury, Part I\\" and \\"Ronny on Empty, Part I\\", she was captured by the Fearcats. In \\"Man of Mercury, Part II\\", it was she who convinced Tyzonn that he should join the team, explaining to him that the deaths of his previous team were not his fault. She used to have a pair of lucky socks that she'd worn for every race and that had never been cleaned ever; the smell was strong enough to stagger Blothgaar. At the end of the series, Ronny decides to go back to racing. Ronny later took up her powers again to fight alongside an army of fellow Rangers in Super Megaforce. Her genetic power is superhuman speed, a power allowing her to pickpocket the fourth jewel from Kamdor. Her primary weapons are the Drive Claws, and she drives the Dozer and Drill Driver Zords. She is portrayed by Caitlin Murphy. =Rose Ortiz= Rose Ortiz is the Pink Overdrive Ranger. She is a Mensa level genius with an encyclopedic knowledge regarding almost any subject, from geography to the Overdrive equipment. As she herself states, she's \\"never wrong.\\"Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \\"Things Not Said\\" Before joining the team she was building a robot in a University lab in London, as well as writing a paper on Advanced Nuclear Robotics Science, and at Harvard she took a year in Ancient Universal Legends. At the beginning of the series she is shown as a semi punk scene type of girl. Later on in the series, she is seen as more of a girly girl. She also claims she learned how to translate morse code by the age of four. Despite her high intelligence, she shows a highly casual nature and is often found chewing something. She is also a highly dangerous fighter, battling Mig on her own and won but did not destroy himPower Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \\"One Fine Day\\" and doing the same with Miratrix and one of Kamdor's monsters.Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \\"Pirate In Pink\\" Growing up so quickly because of her high intelligence, (even skipping most of grade school, starting college at eight years old), Rose didn't have much of a childhood. Rose mixed zord based technology with the Sentinel Sword to create a new armor, but she mentioned it was not safe for humans. Her new armor would be later on used by Mack Hartford-an android-as his Battlizer, making him the Red Sentinel Ranger. At the end of the series, Rose, knowing intelligence is something to be proud of, decides to go back to teaching. She would return to Ranger duty in Super Megaforce to take part in the final battle against the Warstar Armada. Her genetic power is invisibility, her primary weapon is the Drive Geyser, and she drives the Sub and Shovel Driver Zords. She is portrayed by Rhoda Montemayor. =Tyzonn= Tyzonn, sometimes called Ty for short, is an alien called a Mercurian from the fictional planet Mercuria. He was previously a member of the Intergalactic Emergency Responder Squad, a search and rescue team, alongside his fiancée Vella. During an unfortunate accident when his team was killed by the Fearcats after he sent them back into a collapsing cave, Tyzonn dedicated himself to tracking down the criminal group and bringing them to justice for their crimes. He managed to track them to Earth, but his search was cut short when he was confronted by Moltor, who attacked Tyzonn and transformed him into a Pachycephalosaurus/dragon-like monster. In exchange for his loyalty, he promised to turn him back to normal. However, Mack realized that he wasn't a villain, and the Rangers worked with him to retrieve the Parchment as well as the Touru Diamond. The power of the two Corona Aurora gems reverted him back to his humanoid form afterwards. When the Fearcats attacked anew with extra power granted by Flurious, Tyzonn at first refused to join the other Rangers in battle due to the fear of causing the deaths of another group of friends. However, thanks to Ronny convincing him that his past experiences weren't his fault, he was able to move on, and took the powers of the Mercury Ranger to combat the Fearcats alongside his new team. He's had some problems adjusting to life on Earth – he annoyed Will by trying too hard to be like him. He's shown an interest in learning more about his teammates, trying hard to find out about Rose. He grows a plant in his spare time. He was reunited with Vella with help from Norg, who rescued her from the Chillers who Flurious had told to destroy him and Vella.Power Rangers Operation Overdrive episode \\"Crown and Punishment\\" He would later join the Megaforce Rangers to battle against the Armada forces at the end of Super Megaforce. As a Mercurian, he has the innate ability to transform his body into mercury; his primary weapon is the Drive Detector, and he drives an unnamed fire truck Zord and the Rescue Runner Zords, which he combines to pilot the Flash Point Megazord. He is portrayed by Dwayne Cameron. Allies=Andrew Hartford= Andrew Hartford is a billionaire adventurer who owns several companies and corporations. It was he who unearthed the Corona Aurora. After doing so, the Guardian of the Crown appeared to him and instructed him on what to do to protect it. Six months later, Mr. Hartford recruited his team of Rangers to help protect the Crown. With his knowledge and wealth, Andrew was able to create Power Ranger technology. Mr. Hartford himself was ready to become the Red Ranger, willing to face the same dangers those he employed would, but his own son Mack has taken the role. Andrew originally tried to prevent this out of concern for Mack's safety but has come to accept it, and when his son suffers from crises of confidence Andrew has encouraged him to remain a Ranger. Andrew now manages the technical side of the operations. He can be extremely pragmatic.Power Rangers episode \\"Ronny On Empty\\" It was revealed he was keeping something secret about Mack's origins, he stated in private that Mack shouldn't have been able to be affected by the bad luck spell,Power Rangers episode \\"Out of Luck\\" and seemed afraid of the possible implications. He later stated in that Mack had only arrived two years ago, and before that it had just been him and Spencer. This contradicts Mack's statement in the same episode that he \\"hadn't been on a picnic in 10 years.\\". It was later revealed that Mack was an android, and that Andrew physically built him a little over two years prior; unable to meet the right woman due to his work, he had decided to play God and make himself a son regardless. To make Mack look like he has a childhood, Andrew and Spencer made some photoshopped pictures.Power Rangers episode \\"Things Not Said\\" Andrew Hartford is portrayed by Rod Lousich. =Spencer= Spencer is the loyal butler for the Hartfords and has been for years (he has made a few sarcastic remarks regarding his salary). A former member of The Royal Navy, he is more than a mere servant, he is a friend to Mack, Mr. Hartford, and the entire Ranger team, and has been known to drive the team's Overdrive Truck. After monitoring Andrew's adventures and taking care of the team, he can take the position of second-in-command when Andrew's in trouble. Spencer is also sent on missions of his own on occasion, using his impressive disguise skills – he once convincingly disguised himself as Ronny. Possessing a dry sense of humor, Spencer is not afraid to tell his employer he may be wrong about a course of action (such as initially denying Mack the morpher) and understands the Ranger's personalities (such as when he gets Will to break into Hartford's safe by talking about how unbreakable it is, knowing Will can't resist the challenge). He also provides emotional support and the voice of reason in many of the Ranger's personal crisis, including when Mack realized he wasn't human. Spencer is almost never seen without a feather duster or several glasses of lemonade that he serves. Spencer is portrayed by David Weatherley. =Sentinel Knight= The Sentinel Knight is the original protector of the Corona Aurora. Millennia ago, after Flurious and Moltor had attempted to steal the Crown, the Knight took it upon himself to separate the Crown and its Jewels. This was done in order to stop anyone from getting the power again. The guardian scattered the crown and the five jewels on a distant, uninhabited planet. That planet, those many millennia ago was Earth. He appeared to Andrew Hartford after he had found the Corona Aurora, and explained to him about the evil that would come and what to do to protect the crown. He again appeared in order to convince Will, Dax, Ronny and Rose that they were the world's only hope. The Sentinel Knight made another appearance to congratulate the Rangers on their victory and retrieval of the second gem of the Corona Aurora.Power Rangers episode \\"Face to Face II\\" It was revealed he had battled and imprisoned Thrax, the villainous son of Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd. When Thrax returned and disabled the Overdrive Ranger's powers, the Sentinel Knight summoned five veteran Rangers and repowered them so they could temporarily defend the jewels in the current Rangers' place. Initially, the Sentinel Knight seemingly named the Retro Rangers as the Overdrive Rangers' replacements which visibly upset the Overdrive Rangers.Power Rangers episode \\"Once a Ranger\\" However, it proved to not be the case as their link to the Morphing Grid is eventually repaired. After Mack retrieved the sword Excelsior, he gave it to the Sentinel Knight so that no one could use it to harm him and its power restored Sentinel Knight back to his physical form. After being restored to physical form, he swiftly destroyed Thrax. He has since been a valuable ally and fighter, capable of transforming into the powerful Sentinel Sword weapon. Thanks to additions by Rose, it is possible for the Sentinel Knight to merge with Mack and turn him into the Red Sentinel Ranger, creating a \\"Battlizer.\\" He is still sentient in this form and is able to talk to Mack, like Saba and the White Ranger in Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. When the jewels and the crown were finally recovered, Sentinel Knight returned to his original form. His final act before departing was using the Corona Aurora to turn Mack into a flesh-and-blood human. He did not appear alongside the Overdrive Rangers during the events of Super Megaforce-why is unknown, it's possible that Sentinel Knight is responsible for restoring the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Mike Corbett/Magna Defender, Ninja Rangers and Dino Rangers' powers to helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all. The Sentinel Knight is voiced by Nic Sampson who previously played Chip Thorn, the Yellow Mystic Ranger from Power Rangers Mystic Force. =Vella= Vella is Tyzonn's fiancée. She worked alongside Tyzonn as a rescuer. She was originally believed to have been killed in the cave-in caused by the Fearcats but in truth she somehow survived. Crazar mimicked her appearance in order to trick Tyzonn into thinking his adventures with the Rangers was merely a dream in order to distract Tyzonn from helping his fellow rangers from fighting Benglo, Mig and Agrios. Tyzonn was able to come to his senses when he found his morpher, he also realized that Vella was alive since in order for Crazar to mimic a person's appearance the person she disguised herself as had to be alive. This proved to be true in Nothing to Lose when Moltor was revealed to have kept her prisoner and turned her over to Flurious. While kept prisoner by Flurious Vella befriended Norg, knowing that he was not like Flurious or his minions. When Flurious ordered some Chillers to \\"take care of\\" Norg and Vella, Norg protected Vella and took her to safety to the Hartford estate where she was reunited with Tyzonn. Vella is portrayed by Beth Allen. Antagonists The first two groups seen are led by Flurious and Moltor, two brothers who are both after the Corona Aurora gems. They were originally human, but the power of the Corona Aurora transformed them into monsters and scattered them to distant planets. When the Corona was found by Andrew Hartford, the brothers were awoken and attacked Earth. The third group is led by ninja warriors Miratrix and Kamdor. A fourth group is a duo of cat-like aliens that were cybernetically upgraded. Each of the villainous factions works towards their own goal and as such they very often battle each other while having their own set of monsters. =Flurious= Flurious, originally human, has been transformed into a creature made up of ice. He is intelligent enough to create the gyro technology that powers the Fearcats and is incredibly powerful – he went toe-to-toe with Thor himself.Its Hammer Time When he and Moltor were children, Flurious broke Moltor's little red sled, much to his brother's dismay. He is short-tempered and irritable, attacking Norg at the slightest provocation. He was the first of the two brothers to openly declare hostilities, attacking Moltor for the Corona Aurora and declaring \\"it's every man for himself\\" afterwards. He shows a heavy disdain for his brother (Flurious considers himself the smarter and more handsome one), laughing at his misfortunes and openly calling him to insult his intelligence. He always thinks of Moltor as incompetent, and gets easily annoyed when Moltor fails, although he fails too. One can infer from the verbal exchanges of the two siblings that Flurious is the older brother, though this was never stated onscreen. Flurious took over Norg's ice cave and enslaved the yeti, and has regretted it ever since. He has tried several times to get Norg to either be useful – such as finding the Fearcat's baseRonny on Empty and getting him to run away – or leave, but with no luck.Just Like Me Flurious went to Moltor's base, suggesting that with Miratrix and Kamdor searching for the jewels, it was time for the two brothers to put their differences aside and work together. They did manage to beat the Megazord with the cyborg-zords Moltor built, and capture Mack in the process. But Mack used their own suspicions and past issues to set them against each other, and at the end of the episode they were fighting once more.Follow the Ranger Flurious is one of the least active of the villains, and has had the least success as a result. He originally tended to not search for the jewels, and just wait for Moltor to find them so he could steal them. However, with the Fear Cats' debut, his way of thinking soon changed. He briefly attempted to work with other villains: he brought back the Fearcats as cyborgs with his gyro technology, intending for them to work for him,Man of Mercury and teamed up with Kamdor to find the Cannon of Ki Amuk.Behind the Scenes This backfired when the Fearcats turned on him near-instantly and stole one of his robots, and Kamdor and Flurious fell out over whose fault it was. All three villains battled each other as a result, and – aside from Thrax's alliance – this was the last Flurious has tried working with others. The only exception since then came when the Fearcats were destroyed, and Flurious made a one-chance offer to Moltor to work for him; though it is unlikely that he thought his brother would actually take him up on the offer.Home and Away Flurious gets his hands on the third jewel of the Corona Aurora, thanks to Norg. However, he doesn't show gratitude towards the poor Yeti.Two Fallen Foes Flurious uses the jewel to destroy Moltor's lair, then commits fratricide by luring him to his lair and taking the Corona Aurora before freezing him solid, then shattering him. Using the combined power of the blue sapphire and the crown, Flurious was able to locate the rangers' base where the remaining jewels were hidden.Nothing to Lose After an assault on their home Flurious forces the rangers for the rest of the jewels by threatening Mack, Flurious got all the jewels and did not destroy Mack. He then completes the crown and powers up to his ultimate form, a powerful golem/snowman-like monster composed of stone and ice called Flurrex. He then begins to bring a new ice age to the planet. During his fight with the rangers, Flurious grows to gigantic size and destroyed the Rangers' 2 Megazords with his massive, super strength by lifting Drivemax Megazord & its Saber, and also the Battlefleet Megazord (in its Battleship mode), with a powerful single blast without even breaking a sweat. Boasting that no human can stop him, Mack (who is an android) decides to face him alone in Battlizer mode while the others face his army of Chillers. Mack defeats Flurious and separates him from the crown. Flurious was a fool for not destroyed Mack sooner when he had the chance. Before Flurious in his weakened state can put the crown back on, Mack picks him up and Mack kills Flurious for good. He was portrayed by Gerald Urquhart. Norg Norg is a Yeti who lives in the cave that Flurious decided to use as a base. He claims to be the last of the Yeti, but has a cousin named Sasquatch who he hasn't talked to in a long time. Extremely dimwitted, to the point where he thinks penguins are trick-or- treaters in costumes, he sees Flurious as his \\"new friend\\" even after being blasted (although eventually he realized this treatment was not out of friendship, this could have described Norg as Flurious' pet peeve). He assists in the villain's attempts to retrieve the Aurora gems out of coercion, though he does not appear to be evil himself and is more inclined to goof off on his missions. He was guarding Mack while Moltor and Flurious attempted to start the DriveMax Megazord. He told Mack the secrets of both brothers and later on used the secrets against them. He finds the bodies of Mig and Benglo and Flurious tries his new gyros out on them and then they come back to life. Norg ran away from Flurious' lair after Flurious caught Norg on his throne then yelled at him for it. He went to Moltor's lair where he gave him Chillers to use and was told to stay. Moltor also had yelled Norg for catching him on his throne as well too. Norg realized and thought that Flurious missed him and after Moltor and his crew were defeated by the Rangers he kicked Norg out of his lair but not before telling Moltor he was glad Flurious broke his sled. Even Flurious in the end was not glad to see Norg either. He wounded himself and was healed by Tyzonn and Rose; in return, he later used a healing ritual to save Tyzonn's life after the Ranger was wounded by the Fearcats. He proves he is an excellent tracker when he helps the Black Ranger find the Fearcats hideout. Norg tries to prove himself to Flurious by stealing the third jewel from Kamdor. He succeeds, by coincidence, and gives it to Flurious, who despite the efforts of Norg, doesn't thank him or change his perception of him. He then befriends Tyzonn's fiancée, Vella, who sees that he is not like Flurious and his soldiers. Norg also reveals to Vella that he knew Tyzonn. When Flurious completed the corona aurora he instructs his chillers to \\"Take care\\" of Vella and Norg, this sends Norg into a fury causing him to destroy all the chillers left behind. He then managed to escape from Flurious' lair with Vella. He is now living with the Hartfords after Spencer found him eating the flowers.Crown and Punishment He was portrayed by Kelson Henderson. Chillers The Chillers are Flurious' foot soldiers. Flurious' Monsters * Temple Monster \\\\- A temple belonging to the lost city of Atlantis underwater where the Rangers were exploring into for a gem, it was brought to the surface. Flurious interrupted their search and made the temple come to life. * Flurious' Robot \\\\- A large robot Flurious created with an enlarged Gyro as its power source. Originally Flurious was going to pilot it to retrieve the ancient Cannon of Kiamook, but it was stolen by the Fearcats in an act of betrayal. =Moltor= Moltor, like his brother Flurious, was also originally human, but was transformed into a red, fire-elemental dragon- like creature when he attempted to steal the Corona Aurora. When he and Flurious were kids, Flurious broke Moltor's little red sled, resulting in a long-lasting grudge. He considers himself a warrior and is extremely strong, capable of taking on all five Rangers at once. He wields two swords in battle. He is also shown capable of wielding magic, such as turning Tyzonn into a reptilian servant and forcing him to work under him. He's every bit as strong as his brother, having fought him to draw when they first fought (they fight each other in later episodes, but these battles always end in a draw). He is far more direct and aggressive than his brother; when they arrived on Earth, he attacked the Rangers directly and abducted Andrew Hartford to secure the Corona crown. He is responsible for far more attacks and schemes than Flurious and as a result has seen more success – he gained possession of the Corona and once stole the Compass relic right as the Rangers retrieved it. He is vicious and merciless; in his debut, he unleashed a volcanic eruption on San Angeles merely as a diversion, and in later instance killed some of his Lava Lizards just because he was angry. His grudge with his brother has left them bitter enemies. He wishes for his brother to respect him, and tried to achieve this by taking control of the weather and flooding the planet.Weather of Not Moltor agrees to Flurious' suggestion that with Miratrix and Kamdor searching for the crown, the two brothers are better off working together. However, Mack used their own suspicions and hatred of each other to set them fighting again. Despite this failed alliance, he later joined forces with the Fearcats and had much more success with them than Flurious did: constructing a Cybernetic Rex capable of defeating the DriveMax Ultrazord, capturing Ronny to use as a power source, and briefly turning the Sentinel Knight evil. With his volcano lair falling apart due to Flurious' jewel, Moltor decided to lead his lava lizards in an all out attack on the rangers to gain the remaining jewels. Mack arrived to get the crown from Moltor and a vicious battle ensued, which ended when the other rangers came to get Mack out. Barely surviving the battle and the destruction of his lair, Moltor came to Flurious' den with Tyzonn's fiancé, Vella, and the crown. In his weakened state, Flurious was easily able to destroy him and take the crown. Moltor was featured in Power Rangers: Super Legends. He is the villain faced in the Operation Overdrive section of both versions. In the console version, Moltor even becomes giant and fights the Drivemax Ultrazord. He was voiced by Mark Ferguson in the TV series and by David Lodge in Power Rangers: Super Legends. Lava Lizards The Lava Lizards are a group of red lizard men who are Moltor's foot soldiers. The Lava Lizards are known to survive in lava and in hot conditions. Their design is based on the DragonZord. Moltor's Monsters Most of Moltor's monsters are based on dinosaurs and/or dragons whether they were enhanced Lava Lizards or giant pilotable cyborgs: * Giant Sea Creature - A giant cyborg Plesiosaurus monster that emerged from the sea after Andrew Hartford was rescued. * Weather Machine Monster - Moltor created a weather control device that began to malfunction when its alien technology was introduced to human technology without proper configuration. Thus, the weather control device began to turn the entire area into a frozen wasteland and then assumed a monster form before being destroyed by the Drivemax Megazord. * Volcan (voiced by James Gaylyn) - Moltor had his Lava Lizards fight each other to the death until only one was standing. That Lava Lizard was transformed into the Salamander/Lava Lizard monster Volcan. Moltor assigned him the job to obtain the Fire Heart scale that was on its way to Andrew Hartford's mansion. * Moltorzord - A huge dragon/rhinoceros robot that was created and piloted by Moltor. While possessing immense strength, this robot could also fire Gatling gun blasts and chains that can wrap around the enemy. * Dragonizer - A large Pterodactylus/dragon-like robot that was piloted by Flurious during his truce with Moltor. It wields a boomerang in battle. * Scaletex (voiced by Patrick Kake) - An armored Lindworm/Velociraptor-like creature sent by Moltor to hunt down Kamdor and Miratrix. He retrieved the Ancient Parchment from them and brought it back to Moltor. He was last seen caught in a cave-in during a fight with Kamdor and Miratrix. * Tyzonn Monster (voiced by Dwayne Cameron) - Moltor turned a Mercurian named Tyzonn into a Pachycephalosaurus/dragon-like creature upon defeating him and later used him to obtain a parchment from the Rangers. * Bullox (voiced by Will Wallace) - A four-eyed bull/Nāga creature sent to assist Tyzonn in obtaining the parchment. He wields a crescent-tipped scepter in battle and he can breathe fire. * Lavadactyls - A trio of Pteranodon-like that were each piloted by a Lava Lizard. They can shoot lasers from their mouths. * Blothgarr (voiced by Charlie McDermott) - A red Chinese Dragon-like monster who is an old friend of Moltor. He was given a luck-altering compass that Moltor stole from the Rangers. He can breathe fire and bring down red lightning from the skies. * Cybernetic Rex - A robotic Tyrannosaurus/Allosaurus monster in battleship-like armor created and piloted by Moltor. It can bite, shoot lasers from its cannons, and it also has the ability to launch swarms of Lavadactyls. * Magmador (voiced by Mark Wrigth) - A Styracosaurus/dragon-like monster with tentacles for a left hand. This monster accompanied Moltor in obtaining the Tri-Dragon Key in Japan where his tentacles were used to track down the Tri-Dragon Key. He can turn his tentacles into replicates of the Rangers' weapons. =Kamdor= Kamdor is Miratrix's master. He was trapped inside a jewel that Miratrix wore around her neck after he saved her on a distant planet and was eventually released by a device Will stole for Miratrix (while undercover). He wields two swords that can combine to form a double-bladed naginata, and he can create monsters and enlarge them using sutras. He has no foot soldiers, but once brainwashed ninja-garbed stunt men at a movie set into serving him. He battles both the Rangers and other villains in his search for the jewels; he has clashed with Moltor and the Fearcats several times. He has briefly worked with Flurious and was part of Thrax's army (teaming up with Mig to attack Stonehenge),Once a Ranger but his alliances are brief and don't last. He has clashed with Will several times, first when the Ranger was pretending to defect to evil (Kamdor never trusted him), again to steal the third jewel. Finally he accuses Will of constantly failing in the last episode showing a specific contempt of him, and was quite surprised to find how strong Will really was in their final clash. He and Miratrix have had greater success than most of their rival villains in searching for the jewels, mostly due to the fact that they are more covert than the other villains who mostly use brute force. They were able to steal the Parchment left behind by the Ho-Oh bird, the third jewel of the Corona Aurora,One Gets Away and located and gained the fourth jewel (though Ronny used her superspeed to pickpocket it from him). He had a strong partnership with Miratrix. Aside from being imprisoned saving her life, he had shown an amiable working relationship with her. When she was knocked flying by the Fearcats, he sounded genuinely concerned. However, he still didn't view her as an equal and left her out of the details of some of his plans – he organized an alliance with Flurious without her, and he was shown not informing her of the plan in advance and sending her against the Rangers while he searched for the jewel, even though she technically wasn't needed. The relationship had collapsed, and he told her that he was wrong 'to think she could be more than she is', dismissing her as a \\"worthless greedy underling\\". He was shown to be increasingly irate about losing to the Rangers, and angrily beat the Mercury Ranger into unconsciousness; at the end of the 2-parter, he declared to Miratrix he was tired of the failures and \\"it's time to make our final move\\". Later he made his final move in waiting for the Rangers to do the hard work and then attacking with sudden force, successfully stealing the Golden Plate that led to the fifth jewel. He also imprisoned Miratrix in the jewel that had once held him. He used the third jewel to summon a meteor to Earth as a diversionary tactic, and Will had to face Kamdor in a solo duel while the other Rangers handled the meteor. During this, time Kamdor switched to his Duel Mode where his mask parts gave way to reveal his true, gray monstrous face. Kamdor, deliberately taking this battle \\"to the end\\", was eventually destroyed by the Black Ranger, and the Plate was retrieved. He was voiced by Adam Gardiner (though Richard Simpson had been credited as Kamdor in \\"Pirate in Pink\\"). Miratrix Miratrix was first shown in her human disguise of Mira. Faking a monster attack for Dax to save her from, she managed to become his girlfriend and used this position to gain the Sword of Neptune scrolls. She slipped up by mentioning the Rangers' quest for the jewels, about which Dax had never told her; as a result, she was tricked into stealing a fake scroll and her plan was thwarted.Heart of Blue Miratrix has served Kamdor loyally after he was imprisoned saving her life, and together they search for the Corona jewels. She is a dangerous warrior, facing the Rangers with her hand-to-hand and tantō sword skill. She was attracted to Will when he pretended to defect, and was angered when she discovered it had been an act.Both Sides Now She's shown the ability to go undercover – Miratrix disguised herself as an aid from the Mayor of San Angeles' office in order to give them Kamdor's fake medals to immobilize the new Mercury Ranger. She went undercover in Egypt and was able to overhear information the Rangers were given without being noticed. She had a strong partnership with Kamdor and was always at his side, serving him loyally. She seemed very friendly with him, but she was once frustrated by not being let in on his plans and being dispatched against the Rangers while he searched for the fourth jewel. She appeared to have believed she was considered an equal, whereas he actually treated her as a trusted subordinate. Finally after an unsuccessful attempt at reclaiming the Octavian Chalice from the rangers, Kamdor told Miratrix he was tired of her failures and stated she was only an underling and he'd been a fool to believe she could be more. In retaliation, an upset Miratrix interrupted the ceremony the Rangers were holding involving the Chalice, attempting to gain its power. She was transformed into a giant owl-like monster thanks to its energy, and in this form had enough power to take down the BattleFleet Megazord until Tyzonn and Ronny managed to break her connection to the Chalice. After being defeated by the Rangers and reverting to her normal form, Kamdor arrived without warning to exploit the situation. He revealed he had been using her to do just what she had done, and after letting Miratrix have a moment of despair, he imprisoned her in the jewel he had originally been sealed in. Whether Kamdor had the jewel at the time of his eventual destruction is unknown, though Flurious stated that Miratrix was also destroyed. She was portrayed by Ria Vandervis. Kamdor's Monsters Most of the monsters that Kamdor creates look like they are made up of two items: * Ultrog (voiced by Richard Simpson) - A Lock/data disk monster that assisted Miratrix in obtaining the Neptune Scrolls. * Bombardo - An arquebus/factory object monster summoned by Kamdor from an abandoned pirate ship cannon. He was sent alongside Miratrix to obtain the Eye of the Sea. * Big Mouth Monster (voiced by Mark Williams) - A purse/vacuum cleaner monster created by Kamdor from a blue purse that was on a picnic blanket. * Camera Monster - A dark clay/camera monster created by Kamdor from a movie camera. * Amplifier Monster - A fire stove bellow/loudspeaker monster created by Kamdor from a loudspeaker. * Top Hat - A top hat/animal picture book monster created by Kamdor from a silk top hat. He seemed to act and be referred to as a magician. * Generalissimo - A sextant/chalk monster that assisted Kamdor and Miratrix in a museum robbery to steal a gem that they thought was a Corona Aurora jewel. * Datum (voiced by Gerald Urquhart) - A computer/good luck charm monster created by Kamdor from a computer. He created a computer virus that infected the BattleFleet Zords, the Ranger's base computers and Mack himself (who turned out to be an android). * Garbage Monster - A bowling ball-headed monster with a body of multiple other items such as a Japanese war fan, an air conditioner, and other garbage. It was summoned by Kamdor alongside four other monster to fight the Rangers so that Kamdor can retrieve the Star of Isis. He wields a bowling pin in battle. * Golem Monster - A mechanical golem monster that was summoned by Kamdor to fight the Rangers so that Kamdor can retrieve the Star of Isis. * Statue Monster - A samurai statue monster that was summoned by Kamdor to fight the Rangers so that Kamdor can retrieve the Star of Isis. He can shoot beams from his eyes and wields a sword. * Kunoichi Monster - A winged kunoichi monster was summoned by Kamdor alongside other monsters to fight the Rangers while he took the Star of Isis. She wielded two large swords in battle. * Prince Monster - A prince monster with glass slippers on the sides of his head that was summoned by Kamdor to fight the Rangers so that Kamdor can retrieve the Star of Isis. He wielded a rapier in battle. =Fearcats= The Fearcats were the last members of a dangerous race of demonic, feline extraterrestrials running free in the universe. They were malicious, and their debut episode showed that they enjoyed destroying things and hurting people just to show that they could. They also had a personal history with Tyzonn - they deliberately killed his teammates for fun, after Tyzonn had sent them into a mine to rescue the workers from the Fearcats, who he thought were trapped. As natural Fearcats they had the ability to grow by ripping off their skin. Originally Mig and his partner Cheetar came to Earth to find and use the jewels of the Corona Aurora to free their kind from the Prison Mirror, but after becoming impatient they used Ronny's morpher instead. As a result, Benglo was freed before the Prison Mirror itself was destroyed by Tyzonn, which in turn also permanently trapped the remaining Fearcats imprisoned within. Cheetar then sacrificed himself to save the two stronger Fearcats by using the last of his strength to grow and confront the Rangers' Zords in a battle to the death. The two remaining Fearcats would also later be killed when they attempted to use the same tactic, but, unlike Cheetar, they were not completely destroyed when struck down. Norg discovered their lifeless bodies and Flurious revived them as cyborgs using his gyro technology. Using their enhanced powers they almost killed the Rangers in the first few confrontations until Tyzonn stepped in as the Mercury Ranger. Though Flurious originally intended for the Fearcats to serve him, the duo betrayed him by stealing the giant robot he built and struck out on their own. They decided to find the Corona jewels to fulfil their own ambitions and eliminate Tyzonn for the destruction of their Fearcat army. They were stronger than before now that they were cyborgs, and used the very same technology to fashion their own giant robots. The only other remaining Fearcat, Crazar, joined her cybernized comrades in search for the Octavian Chalice; using it in conjunction with three other relics (which they stole from the rival villains), they created the titantic cyborg-golem Agrios and almost succeeded in destroying the Rangers. Agrios eventually fell to combined Zord firepower and all three Fearcats were taken out by the Rangers. Out of all the rangers, (excluding Tyzonn), the Fearcats seem to despise Ronny Robinson, the Yellow Ranger the most due to capturing her twice. \\"Man of Mercury, Part I\\" and \\"Ronny on Empty, Part I\\". Mig Mig was a green and purple cat-like alien who could conjure up a bazooka-like weapon. Mig had a rivalry with Tyzonn, being the one responsible for killing his rescue team. As a cyborg, he was now armed with two pistols that double as short swords, and he possessed far more power. Mig seemed to be the cockier of the two and acted a little immature in battle to Retreat the Rangers, Mig Fights Mercurian in the Forest without backups, Mercurian was Trapped Fighting Mig in the Forest, and was the one most often seen in battle against the Rangers. He once came close to killing Tyzonn, but was beaten back by an Rose. In \\"Once a Ranger,\\" he was impressed with Kamdor's knowledge of Stonehenge when they were sent there to look for the Corona Aurora gems. Following Agrios' defeat, he engaged Tyzonn in a single combat in the Top of the Mountains of the Skilled combat and was destroyed by the Mercurian. He was voiced by Kelson Henderson. Benglo Benglo is a fire- breathing, Bengal tiger-like alien. He was trapped inside the prison mirror until Cheetar and Mig freed him. As a cyborg, his power was great, and he was armed with a sword/shotgun weapon. Benglo seemed to be very serious, acting as a foil to Mig's impulsive nature, and left most of the fighting to Mig while he piloted their various giant robots. After Agrios was defeated, he fought the five main Rangers while Mig battled Tyzonn. After witnessing the demise of his partner Benglo vowed vengeance, but before he could enact it he too met his end when he was destroyed by the Red Sentinel Ranger. He was voiced by David Weatherley. Cheetar Cheetar was a gray cheetah Fearcat, with a short violent temper, who came to earth with Mig to search for the jewels of the Corona Aurora in an attempt to free their army from the prison mirror. Cheetar and Mig kidnapped Ronny and successfully managed to free Benglo from the mirror, only for it to be destroyed by Ronny and Tyzonn, thus destroying the other Fearcats still sealed within. Later on, Cheetar took the hit from the Drill Blaster for Mig and Benglo. He then used the last of his energy to enlarge himself and was killed in battle by the DriveMax Ultrazord. he Is Based On Tor The Shuttlezord From Mighty Morphin Power Rangers He was voiced by James Gaylyn. Crazar Crazar was a female wolf-like Fearcat, who was thought to have been killed in the same cave-in that Mig caused to kill Tyzonn's teammates and fiancé Vella long ago. Tyzonn stated that she was \\"worse than Mig and Benglo\\", and she showed a sadistic delight in tormenting him over Vella's apparent demise.Red Ranger Unplugged Actually, Vella is alive; Crazar had somehow placed her in Moltor's custody, and had developed the ability to replicate the Mercurian's form, seemingly just to use it against Tyzonn. She also had the power to create highly realistic illusions. Upon arriving on Earth she teamed up with Mig and Benglo and helped them obtain the Octavian Chalice. During her fight with the DualDrive Megazord, Tyzonn had attempted to destroy her completely with an ancient Mercurian spell. It failed and Crazar resurfaced. She impersonated Tyzonn's fiancé Vella and created an illusion of Mercuria, trying to convince Tyzonn that everything since the cave-in had been a dream so he had to be kept out of the way of the other Fearcats. Crazar's cover was eventually and unintentionally blown by Spencer and she was destroyed for good in a vicious battle against Tyzonn. She was voiced by Lori Dungey. Fearcats' Monsters Most of the Fearcats' monsters are giant robots that can be piloted by the Fearcats: * Jet Robot - A giant jet-themed robot piloted by Mig and Benglo. * Commando Robot - A giant commando-themed robot piloted by Mig and Benglo. * Centurion Robot - A giant battle helicopter-themed robot piloted by Mig and Benglo. It was powered by the Centurion Torch. * Agrios - A gigantic powerful homunculus monster that was created by the Fearcats after they mixed Minerva's Staff, The Root of Hesper, and The Sands of Sila inside the Octavian Chalice (after stealing each of them from Moltor, Flurious, and Kamdor). The Fearcats were able to harness the monster's abilities like a giant robot after they attached their own robotic armor with their cockpit in it. =Thrax= Thrax is the son of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers villains Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, and the grandson of Master Vile. He appears as the main villain in the \\"Once a Ranger\\" episodes. Thrax inherited most of his appearance from his father, it seems, due to his physical appearance and his Z-Staff. His powers seem to be similar to those of his father. His mother's appearance isn't apparent, except that he has a part humanoid (similar to Grimlord from VR Troopers) face, and torn cloth-like orange ornaments wrapped around his horns. One similarity to his mother is that he too was imprisoned in a space dumpster. His jawbone resembles that of his maternal uncle, Rito Revolto and has a skeletal spinal column, a combination resembling his father and uncle. His shoulder pads and chest armor are similar to Zeltrax from Power Rangers Dino Thunder. Thrax was imprisoned by the Sentinel Knight in a space dumpster, much like Zordon had done to his mother pre-Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. He grew stronger as the Sentinel Knight grew weaker and was able to escape as his mother did on the moon, and now he sought revenge on the Sentinel Knight. Angry at his parents for becoming good and wanting to restore their evil legacy, he united the four Overdrive villain groups into an alliance to destroy the Power Rangers. They managed to defeat the Rangers easily and break their link to the Universal Morphing Grid, stripping them of their powers. When the Sentinel Knight responded by creating a team of veteran Rangers, Thrax decided to seek out the magical sword Excelsior to destroy him – following Mack (Hartford) right to it. However, because of Thrax's evil nature, he was unable to claim the sword and he retreated to continue his rampage. Thrax proved to be a strong fighter in the final battle, managing to overpower the Defender Vest, before being beaten aside by Adam Park. Thrax was finally destroyed by the newly (and fully) restored Sentinel Knight, causing the other villains to retreat and continue their rivalry. His father's Z-Staff was collected by Ryjack in Power Rangers Beast Morphers. He was portrayed by Glen Levy. Vulturus Vulturus is a vulture-like monster created by Thrax. Supposedly according to Thrax, he is invincible or was thought to be. He is grown and sent to attack the Rangers in their Megazords only to be destroyed by Mack using Excelsior. Later, he was found weakened, but in one piece by the villains. Flurious managed to restore his strength and upgrade him with a Gyro into the more human-like Vulturus Maximus. In this second form, he was destroyed by the Mercury Ranger's Drive Detector.

Jungle Fury Rangers The Jungle Fury Power Rangers are the eponymous protagonists. After becoming members of the Pai Zhua (, Pài Zhuǎ) and learning martial arts under the guidance of Master Mao, Casey, Lily, and Theo fight Dai Shi and his disciples the Rinshi Beasts. =Casey Rhodes= Casey Rhodes (portrayed by Jason Smith) was a fairly new member to the Pai Zhua Academy and hence known as a cub and possessed the spirit of the tiger. He has the power to stand up for what he believes in and for others. He doesn't like other people to get picked on. When Casey stood up one day for a fellow cub who was being verbally abused by Jarrod, Master Mao (the leader of the Pai Zhua Academy) dismissed Jarrod. Master Mao saw the potential that Casey had in him and chose him instead of Jarrod, to guard Dai Shi's imprisonment box. After Master Mao was destroyed and Dai Shi escaped, the trio went to Ocean Bluff where they met their new master - RJ - and gave him the powers of the Jungle Fury Red Ranger. Casey still had doubts about himself because his teammates were much more experienced than him and he felt like he had to train twice as hard. At the pizza pallor Jungle Karma Pizza, he was a pro when it came to making pizza. Casey now needed to find out what it takes to become a leader and lead his team. Casey can be overconfident, especially when he tried to go up against Dai Shi alone, but he got himself hurt. After Lily and Theo had received new masters, Casey was eager to meet his new master, but R.J. was not because it is his father Master Finn. When Master Finn saved Casey from Rinshi, Casey became good friends with the master and mastered the shark technique. Casey eventually made up with R.J. that he will always be his master. When Dai Shi beat up the Rangers profusely in a big showdown and sequestered R.J., the Rangers were left Master-less. R.J. told them they knew what to do, which was to go back to basics, which led them back to the Pai Zhua Academy room where Dai Shi was kept. The Rangers noticed the masters' animal spirits etched in the wall and wondered where Master Rilla, Master Guin, and Master Lope are located. They were greeted once more by their fallen teacher Master Mao. He sent them to the Spirit World at Casey's urging to be trained by three fallen masters. They put them through tests, Master Rilla sent Casey to a dimension that resembled his old bedroom and had to face his childhood fear of a monster in his closet. Once he got it over it, he opened the door to find he had passed the test and granted the Claw Boosters, Jungle Master mode, and Gorilla Spirit Zord. He was later able to summon the Shark Spirit Ranger whenever needed. Casey's tiger spirit was stolen by Whiger and he was unable to morph, because if he did, his life would be in danger. Casey was teaching a class of young students at the time and one of his students that was always being picked on, helped in giving more power against a foe. Whiger's Rinzin was taken by Dai Shi and banished for not defeating Casey. Casey helped and befriended the weakened Whiger and Whiger assisted him in saving his friends. Whiger then faded away because his power was running out, but he didn't leave Casey's mind. When Casey battled Master Finn in a test for his Master Stripes, he didn't know what to do and followed what the others did and failed. R.J. later commented to Theo and Lily about this stating that a \\"student follows his master and doesn't ask.\\" He then saw Jarrod save Camille from danger and was convinced that Jarrod was still in Dai Shi, but no one else believed him. He fought Dai Shi in his palace and came back with Jarrod and Camille to join in battle, for this he earned his stripes from R.J. After the final battle against Dai Shi, Casey was teaching a class in Phi Zhua with Jarrod and Camille as students. He even repeated the \\"student follows his master and doesn't ask\\" wisdom to his students. In Super Megaforce besides teaching children his Kung Fu, Casey works as a part-time zookeeper at the local zoo. He trains Emma and Jake in fighting without using weapons in order to battle the magnetic-powered Pacha Chamak. After the battle when the Rangers visit the zoo to thank Casey, they learn from a zookeeper that no one named Casey works at the zoo. Emma and Jake later see Casey in a gazebo before he disappears into thin air. He would later appear-though without removing his helmet as a part of the Ranger army. =Lily Chilman= Lily Chilman (portrayed by Anna Hutchison) is a lively young woman who controls the Cheetah Spirit and is eager to be given the powers of the Jungle Fury Yellow Ranger. She soon learns to control the Elephant Spirit and Jungle Mace after training from Master Phant and the Penguin Spirit from Master Guin in the Spirit World. Lily was long time student at Pai Zuha, and after succeeding in her final test, had been chosen to help guard the spirit of Dai Shi, along with Casey & Theo. After Dai Shi escaped, and Master Mao was destroyed, Casey, Theo & Lily went to Ocean Bluff to find their new master, RJ. Now with the powers of the Yellow Ranger at her command, Lily needs to learn that sometimes things need to be taken a bit more seriously. While she is a greatly skilled fighter, Lily can sometimes not comprehend the full severity of a situation. Once Lily mastered the Elephant Technique from Master Phant, and the others had Mastered their new techniques, the Rangers all thought they were unbeatable. However, Dai Shi had been training with masters as well. When they battled against the new more powerful Dai Shi, the Rangers lost, and would have been destroyed had RJ not intervened and gave himself. The Rangers realized that their over confidence had been their downfall, but they didn't let that get them down. The team journeyed to the Spirit World, with the help of Master Mao. Once there, they met their new Masters. Master Guin sent Lily on her journey to conquer her fear of spiders. Upon completing her journey, Lily not only gained the power to summon the Penguin Zord, but she also gained the power to morph into her Jungle Master Mode. After much of the year had passed, the time finally came to Casey, Theo & Lily to go through their Pai Zuha Masters Test. For her test, Lily had to battle against Master Phant. To two combatants squared off and fought hard. But in the end, Lily won the fight and earned her title of Pai Zuha Cheetah Master. In the final battle against Dai Shi, it took help from Camille & Jarrod to help weaken Dai Shi. But only the chosen three could destroy Dai Shi. Together Casey, Theo & Lily reached a level of power no one had ever achieved before. This powerful attack was able to destroy Dai Shi for good. After the battle was over and won, both Lily & Theo remained at Jungle Karma Pizza working, alongside RJ & Flit. Theo finally managed the courage to ask Lily out on a date, and she said yes. Lily would later appear in Super Megaforce as part of the veteran Ranger army who came to the aid of the Megaforce Rangers. =Theo Martin= Theo Martin (portrayed by Aljin Abella) is a smart and well versed fighter in Pai Zhua who controls the Jaguar Spirit when he is given the powers of the Jungle Fury Blue Ranger. He learns to become a team player, eventually gaining control of the Bat Spirit and Jungle Fans after training from Master Swoop and then the Antelope Spirit after training from Master Lope in the Spirit World. He also has an identical twin brother named Lewin. Theo has a crush on Lily, and he asks her for a date later in the last episode. He would later appear in Super Megaforce where he would join in the final battle with the Warstar Armada. =Robert \\"RJ\\" James= Robert \\"RJ\\" James (portrayed by David de Lautour) is the owner of the Jungle Karma Pizza restaurant and master of the Jungle Fury Power Rangers after Master Mao's loss of his physical body. Years ago, when RJ was young, his father, Master Finn, tried constantly to force RJ to learn the Shark Technique & become a Shark Master. However, RJ decided to set out on his own. RJ left home and found his own master, who instructed him in the ways of the Wolf. Upon mastering his Wolf Spirit, RJ became the new Wolf Master. Sometime later RJ opened Jungle Karma Pizza. After Dai Shi escaped, and Master Mao was destroyed, Casey, Theo & Lily went to Ocean Bluff to find their new master, RJ. Though the group didn't not expect the owner of Jungle Karma Pizza to be their master. RJ is the laid back Zen type, who while on the outside may not look like much of a teacher or threat, is very skilled in the ways of Pai Zuha. It was through his connections that the Jungle Fury Power Rangers were born. He had the Solar Morphers connected into the Morphin Grid, thus allowing the heroes to become Power Rangers. RJ has proven to be quite a powerful warrior. Not only did he use his Wolf Spirit and skills to save his father from Dai Shi, but RJ also sacrificed his freedom to save his Rangers. In battle with Dai Shi, RJ refused to fight, and in doing so, allowed Dai Shi a direct attack on the Wolf Spirit. The attack on RJ's Wolf Spirit had a devastating effect on RJ. It somehow turned RJ into a werewolf causing him to hunger for raw meat, and go into its full form. After three nights of this, and believing that he had attack people in the city, RJ decided to leave until he could regain his spiritual balance and control his Animal Spirit. However, when he was engaged in battle with one of Grizzaka's monsters, RJ's werewolf form came out again, in front of the Rangers. The team had to them battle their own friend for a short time. Once RJ returned to normal, the team went back to the loft. RJ explained that if he couldn't regain control, he'd be stuck in his Animal Form forever. It is thanks to Fran that RJ was able to regain his balance. When he went back into the werewolf state, he was ready to attack Fran, but his friend stood up to him and showed compassion for her boss. Though this friendship, RJ was able to return to normal. After doing so, RJ joined the Rangers in battle, but this time he brought along his Wolf Morpher, which he had kept hidden for some time. Now as the Wolf Ranger, RJ was able to fight alongside his team. He uses his Wolf Morpher as his weapon, and is also able to summon his Wolf Zord. When needed, the Wolf Zord can take the place of the Cheetah Zord in the Jungle Pride Megazord. RJ later watched as his trio of students underwent their mastery exams, only to see Theo and Lily pass and Casey fail due to his lack of confidence in himself. Casey approached him for help, but RJ impressed upon him the fact that he could only become a master when he was sure of his own course. In the final battle against Dai Shi, it took help from Camille & Jarrod to help weaken Dai Shi. But only the chosen three could destroy Dai Shi, so together Casey, Theo & Lily reached a level of power no one had ever achieved before. This powerful attack was able to destroy Dai Shi for good. After the battle was over and won, RJ remained in Ocean Bluff, continuing to run his Jungle Karma Pizza Parlor, with the help of Theo, Lily & Flit. He would later join the other Jungle Fury Rangers in battling the Warstar Armada forces in Super Megaforce. =Dominic \\"Dom\\" Hargan= Dominic \\"Dom\\" Hargan (portrayed by Nikolai Nikolaeff) was a student of Master Mao's sent away before the beginning of the series to find his path in life. After six years, he returns to Jungle Karma Pizza posing as Inspector Fuller of the health department until R.J. came down and recognized him. He is initially rejected by the other Rangers because of his irresponsible acts during the fight with Crocovile, until he saves Fran with the refined techniques he developed in his travels. With control over the Rhinoceros Spirit, Dominic transforms into the Jungle Fury Rhino Ranger and uses the Control Dagger to summon the Rhino Steel Zord, unable to form his Spirit into a Zord. Unlike the other rangers, he does not become a Master in the finale, though it is possible he had already achieved this rank due to being a classmate of RJ's. During the last episode he was seen going traveling, asking Fran to come along. He would later join in the final battle of Super Megaforce as part of the veteran Ranger army. =Spirit Rangers= The Spirit Rangers were created by the Phantom Beasts to battle the Power Rangers by using the Crystal Eyes and controlling the Masters. Once the Masters were freed from the Crystal Eyes, they fought alongside the Rangers by controlling the bodies. They later on gave the Rangers control of the Spirit Rangers by way of summoning their Animal Spirits to fight alongside them. In the Final Beast War, the Spirit Rangers fight alongside the masters that inspired them and the Jungle Fury Power Rangers. Similar to the Titanium Ranger and the S.P.D. A-Squad Rangers, they are exclusive to the series. * Shark Spirit Ranger - The Shark Animal Spirit morphed into a Power Ranger.

She discovers that her co-workers are the Power Rangers when she enters R.J.'s loft and sees them fighting on the monitors. She now serves the Ranger squad by either watching the monitors (a task performed by R.J. until he became a Ranger) or taking over the pizza shop when the Rangers have to go to battle. She has a big crush on Dominic after he saved her life when they first met. After Dai Shi's defeat, Dominic invited her to go on a European backpacking trip with him. Hyperventilating, she accepted. She is portrayed by Sarah Thomson. =Pai Zhua Masters= The founding members of the Pai Zhua battled Dai Shi and sealed his soul at the cost of losing three of their members in the fight. After Mao's death by the released Dai Shi, the Rangers learn under the three surviving Pai Zhua Masters, before the Masters were later brainwashed by the Phantom Beasts to become slave-like mediums for the Spirit Rangers. In the series finale, the four deceased Pai Zhua masters briefly return to even the Rangers' odds against the resurrected army of Dai Shi, finishing them off in their stronger anthropomorphic forms. Master Mao Master Mao is the Rangers' previous master at the Pai Zuha academy who possesses a caracal spirit, able to assume a stronger anthropomorphic cat form. Though he died fighting off Dai Shi while protecting the Rangers, Mao continues to help the Rangers in spirit while attempting to give Jarrod the strength to resist Dai Shi. He returns in physical form to help the Rangers during the Final Beast War when Dai Shi opens the gate to the spirit world to resurrect his beasts. As his students, Casey, Lily and Theo all derive their fighting styles and their animal spirits from Master Mao, thus why their animal spirits are all based on different species of cats.

He was later the first to be captured by the Phantom Beasts and his animal spirit transformed into the Bat Ranger. He was freed by R.J. and the Bat Ranger now fights with the other Rangers when summoned by either Theo or Master Swoop. He is portrayed by Oliver Driver. Master Finn Master Finn is a Pai Zhua master and who possesses the spirit of the Shark, able to assume a stronger anthropomorphic shark form. Being R.J.'s father, he tried unsuccessfully to teach his style to R.J., causing a rift between them that is not mended until R.J. proves his strength by demonstrating his own control over the Wolf Spirit. Master Finn trains Casey to use his Shark Sabers and teaches him how to channel his Animal Spirit. Later, he is captured by the Phantom Beasts along with the other masters and his animal spirit is transformed into the Shark Ranger.

Dai Shi Clan The Dai Shi Clan is the antagonistic group of the series. =Dai Shi= Dai Shi is the primary antagonist of Jungle Fury. He is an ancient evil multi- headed Dragon who attempted for 10,000 years to rid the world of the human race and believed that animals should be the rightful rulers, dealing with the Phantom Beasts when they tried to overthrow him. However, Dai Shi was defeated by the first Pai Zhua warriors that became the Masters, sealing his spirit inside a chest and guarded by generations of Pai Zhua members. However, thanks to Jarrod attacking Mao in anguish of being denied the task of guarding him, Dai Shi was released from the seal by accident, killing Mao before using Jarrod's body to revive his Rinshi and continue where he left off, starting the \\"Beast War\\" anew. But though he picked Jarrod for his impurities, his host still has a bit of control over his actions but is heavily influenced by him the same. However, Scorch noticed this when Dai Shi became their Phantom Beast King, his promoting of Camille and exiling of Whiger, deciding to do something about it. After Grinder's defeat, when Scorch questioned Dai Shi's decision to promote Camille out respect in her power or out of care for her, Dai Shi realizes his hold over Jarrod is beginning to malfunction when he attempted to kill Scorch for questioning him. Eventually, Dai Shi regains total control, until Casey's interference managed to break the spirit's hold over Jarrod and is forced to leave his body before siphoning out both his Rinzin and Camille's. Now without a host, Dai Shi begin the final stages of his war and gather enough fear to resurrect his army. But once his revived army was destroyed, Dai Shi used the masters' animal spirits to restore his physical form - a large, golden multi-headed dragon monster - and was practically invincible. However, when Jarrod attacked Dai Shi from the inside, the monster was weakened enough to finally be destroyed by the three chosen guardians: Casey, Theo, and Lily. He is voiced by Geoff Dolan. Jarrod Jarrod was a student of the Pai Zhua and wielder of the lion spirit, able to assume a black lion/Ranger-like armored form known as the Black Lion Warrior when in battle. Though he was highly skilled enough to earn the chance to become one of the guardians of Dai Shi's prison, Jarrod's arrogance forced Master Mao to dismiss him and select Casey instead. In response, Jarrod attacks Mao, accidentally freeing the evil Dai Shi from his prison. Jarrod flees in the chaos, but is taken over by Dai Shi as he runs away. Although he now serves as Dai Shi's host, Jarrod still retains his memories and emotions, as well as a bit self-control. Blaming Casey for his expulsion, Jarrod eventually shows up in person and demonstrates his superiority to the Red Ranger at the time the Five Fingers of Poison began their attack, easily defeating Casey without breaking a sweat. After the Five Fingers were destroyed, Jarrod undergoes the search for the three Overlords, starting with Carnisoar, to master their dark ways. Upon Carnisoar's revival, the wicked master took Jarrod back through time and altered his past, erasing any good deeds Jarrod had done in an effort to help Dai Shi reach the peak of his evil powers. After mastering Jellica's teachings, Jarrod calls out the Rangers to systematically defeat them until R.J. arrives and surrenders himself to save the Rangers. After defeating R.J., Jarrod challenges the Rangers with R.J. as bait. Though he has the upper hand at first, Jarrod is easily defeated by the Red Ranger in his Jungle Master Mode. After Grizzaka overthrew him, Jarrod began a training to master the power of Zocato like Grizzaka did. During one of his trainings, Master Mao's spirit appeared to try to get through to what's left of Jarrod. It is this encounter that causes him to go on a quest to the Rhino Nexus to enhance his powers. When he did arrive, he couldn't get in due to the force field. When he returned, Jellica captured him and a brief battle with Grizzaka is where Jarrod learned about the Control Dagger needed to get into the Rhino Nexus. Upon Jarrod being imprisoned in the dungeon, Camille went out to obtain the Control Dagger and successfully stole it to give to Jarrod. Passing the Sand Snakes that protect the Rhino Nexus, Jarrod is attacked by Grizzaka until the Jungle Master Megazord intervene. Jarrod and Camille made it through the obstacles while the Overlords were occupied. When Dominic confronted them, Jarrod couldn't get the Control Dagger in and Dominic did so. After Carnisoar's destruction, Dai Shi discovered that his Zocato has enhanced from the effects of the Rhino Nexus. Jarrod then faced Grizzaka again, succeeding in overpowering Grizzaka and reclaiming his throne. Camille informed Jarrod that Dr. Silia Jennings has the other five Crystal Eyes when the time for the Phantom Beasts' revival was drawing near. When Camille gave him the Crystal Eyes that Grizzaka had gathered, Jarrod then fought Casey to prevent him from reclaiming the Crystal Eyes before being forced to fall back after Jellica reclaim the three Crystal Eyes. Later, after a vain overthrow attempt by Jellica that cost her life, the Phantom Beasts swear their loyalty to Jarrod, intent to make Dai Shi their Phantom Beast King. Jarrod didn't initially accept their offer because he had Dai Shi's memories of the Phantoms as his enemies, and told them to bring him the three living masters Phant, Swoop and Finn to prove their loyalty, which they soon did and transformed them into the Spirit Rangers. When the Shark Spirit Ranger was destroyed by the modified Claw Cannon, Jarrod was told that Master Finn was absorbed into the Crystal Eye. Jarrod then had Scorch give orders to Unidoom to get rid of that Crystal Eye. When RJ and Master Finn infiltrated the temple, Jarrod fought RJ after Master Phant's attempt to get Jarrod to break free from Dai Shi. After Unidoom's destruction and the Spirit Rangers' defection, Jarrod uses Whiger in the Phantom Beast Generals' next test of loyalty by having him take Casey's tiger spirit. Once Whiger passed, Jarrod undergoes the change into the Phantom Beast King, endowed with the spirit of the Griffin. However, Scorch became aware of Jarrod's influence over Dai Shi when he strips Whiger of his rank and Rinzin Power. After Grinder's defeat, Scorch's fears are realized as his questioning of Dai Shi recent decisions led to Jarrod attempting to regain control of his body, no longer wanting to be used by Dai Shi. While he regained control of his body, Jarrod managed to save Camille from the last three Phantom Beast Warriors, killing Sonimax and Osiris in the process, explaining to her Dai Shi's true feelings towards her before being controlled again. Eventually Casey battles Jarrod again and manages to reach him; as a result Dai Shi is forced out of his body. He helped Casey fight Scorch and defeat him, but afterward he lost his confidence. Eventually regaining it, he uses the Zocato power to weaken Dai Shi from the inside long enough for Casey, Lily and Theo to destroy it. After the battle, he re-enrolled in the Pai Zhua academy to learn from the beginning. He helped, while Casey was resting he taught the children the way of the lion . He is portrayed by Bede Skinner. =Camille= Camille is the servant of Dai Shi, an ill-tempered user of the Chameleon spirit, which gives her the ability to camouflage into her backgrounds and use her long sticky and wet tongue as a weapon in battle. She can also change into a Chameleon-like warrior for her battle mode, using a pair of sai as her weapons of choice. She remained quietly inside a wall until Dai Shi returned in Jarrod's body, resuming her role as his second in command. She serves Dai Shi out of devoted passion, proving herself by perfecting her abilities by withstanding the Claw Cannon and absorbing a bit of its energy before saving her master from Naja, slicing off his Life Talons for Dai Shi to use in his search for the Overlords. Her other various abilities include boosting the power of the Rinshi Beasts. It is hinted that she may have feelings for Dai Shi/Jarrod as she commented that she found Dai Shi's new body to be attractive and she strives to gain his favor. She was also displeased at Dai Shi's change of personality after Carnisoar's training, deciding to resurrect Jellica to accomplish that. She also openly comments that she cares for him to Lily while she was in disguise. Despite his cold treatment of her, Jarrod may carry the same feelings for her as he saved her twice from Jellica's wrath, though the second time he said it was because she was still of use. She spares Lily's life when given the opportunity to destroy her, showing Camille has good inside of her that she is withholding. Camille is followed, and annoyed by, the tiny fly, Flit. She once fought him as a human and cursed him by changing him into his current form and then swallowed him. As a part of the curse, Flit must stay in Camille's stomach or die. While she normally shows him aggression, she has shown a softer side to him meaning she may care about him. Camille had successfully stolen the Control Dagger from Dominic to give to Jarrod. When at the Rhino Nexus, she was attacked by Sand Snakes only to be saved by Dai Shi. Camille later informed Jarrod/Dai Shi that Dr. Silvia Jennings has five of the Crystal Eyes when the time of the revival draws near. She infiltrated the Research Center and obtained the 5 Crystal Eyes only to fight Casey. The Rinshi that seized Dr. Jennings served as a diversion for Camille to get away with the Crystal Eyes and present them to Jarrod/Dai Shi. Following the destruction of Unidoom, Camille concludes that she needs Rinzin Power and tries to convince some of the Phantom Beast Warriors to give her some, but they act like she is joking and refuse. Camille appeared as a hostess on the TV game show \\"Blow That Dough\\" in a plot to get the Rangers cancelled. This was thwarted when RJ sent Casey's morpher through the TV. Once Dai Shi becomes the Phantom Beast King, he makes Camille into a Phantom Beast General and gives her Rinzin Power. With her suggestion, she receives the spirit of the Phoenix. She would later be referred to, in this new form, by Scorch and Snapper, as Camille Phoenix. She fought with a spiritless Casey and a Rinzin deprived Whiger when they arrived to free the other Rangers, bested by the combined efforts of the two Tiger Spirits. She stole a cloning formula from a scientist named Maryl Snyder and used it on Grinder. Afterwards, Camille begins to become targeted by Scorch as she is unknowingly helping Jarrod regain control over himself due to the fact that it is really Jarrod that has feelings for her, rather than Dai Shi. When Jarrod was being attacked by Dai Shi after separating (because he makes the decision to refrain from destroying Casey), Camille ran in to protect Jarrod, losing her Rinzin powers and immortality in the process. Soon after, she helps the rangers in battling Scorch and destroying Snapper. Then, she helps in the fight against Dai Shi, saving the rangers' lives and proving that she strongly cares for the human Jarrod. After Dai Shi was destroyed, she enrolled in the Pai Zhua academy with Jarrod. She is portrayed by Holly Shanahan. =Flit= Flit was originally a martial artist who fought Camille before she cursed him into the form of an anthropomorphic fly and then swallowed him. While not truly evil, he usually resides in Camille's stomach as a result of his curse otherwise he will fade away. Normally emerging during Zord battles, Flit monitors the Rangers' fight as a Battle Commentator. Regardless of who has the upper hand, Flit maintains a neutral standpoint and unbiased commentary. When R.J. saves his life, Flit returns the favors by helping R.J. get control of his animal spirit before he is forced to return to Camille when the curse's effects manifest from being away from her for too long. After these events the Rangers, especially R.J., see Flit as a friend. Flit also managed to help R.J. by catching the Crystal Eye (containing Master Finn) that Unidoom threw into the ocean. By the series finale, Flit has returned to his human form and now works with the rangers at Jungle Karma. Flit is voiced by Kelson Henderson. =The Five Fingers of Poison= These are special Rinshis who are trained in the art of the poisonous animal that they are based on.

The hood he wears over his head conceals his true face, a coiled centipede's tail. He has the ability to strike up to 1000 times in a few seconds. He issued a challenge to Casey but was met by Lily who battled him. After being defeated, he took off his hood and used the Rangers' fear to enlarge and show his full power.

A cunning shuriken master of surprise attacks, able to attach to any surface as if there were multiple microscopic hairs on his soles. Gakko can shed off his own arm to escape a hold and grow a new one while the discarded arm's surprise attack serves as a distraction. As he is constantly over others' heads, he thinks of the walls as 'his world' and looks down at others. In \\"Can't Win Them All,\\" he broke Theo's confidence during battle. Gakko later overpowered Casey and Lily, until Theo eventually arrived after regaining his confidence thanks to R.J. Theo managed to beat Gakko in his own 'world' before the Rinshi Beast enlarged and was destroyed by the Jungle Pride Megazord. In \\"Pizza Slice of Life,\\" Naja later revived him to help him overthrow Dai Shi, but fled after Rantipede was killed and started attacking the city to gather as much power for himself because he had no other option. He confronted the Rangers and was destroyed by their Claw Cannon. In \\"Now the Final Fury,\\" Dai Shi opened a portal to the Spirit World and brought Gakko back who was defeated by the Rangers and their Masters. Stingerella * First Appearance: \\"A Taste In Poison\\" * Voice Actor: Sarah Somerville A red sash-wearing Rinshi who holds the spirit of the Scorpion and the only female member of The Five Poisons. Her dance and kick combination that earned her the nickname, \\"Queen of the Toxic Dance.\\" She lightly poisoned Casey in their first encounter, once Jarrod defeated him. The dosage was not enough to kill him, but it did make him temporarily suffer massive pain. In \\"Dance the Night Away,\\" she is sent to attack the city with her dancing Rinshi. They trounced the Rangers. The Rangers later responded with a similar dance-based technique. Then, Toady interfered, finally convincing Stingerella that they must join forces to combine their strengths. Stingerella, impressed with Toady's new attitude, she fell in love with him. When Toady was destroyed, she vowed to avenge Toady and grew giant. She unleashed an army of little scorpions on the Jungle Pride Megazord but their Savage Spin shook them off and she was ultimately destroyed by it. In \\"Now the Final Fury,\\" Dai Shi opened a portal to the Spirit World and brought Stingerella back. She and Toady fought side by side and were defeated by the Rangers and their Masters. Toady * First Appearance: \\"A Taste In Poison\\" * Voice Actor: Adam Gardiner A yellow sash-wearing Rinshi who holds the spirit of the Toad. He is able to resist most pain and his ultimate move creates a mucus-based forcefield to block any attack easily.

In \\"Dance the Night Away,\\" he is also extremely protective of Stingerella, as he viciously attacked the Rangers after he mistook Theo making out with Stingerella. Though he survived the Megazord's attack, Toady ran off in shame when Stingerella was gone. After getting advice from Camille, Toady toughens up and convinces Stingerella to join him in creating a deadly combination of their abilities. However, Toady is destroyed when his barrier is penetrated by a shot from the newly pristine Claw Cannon. In \\"Now the Final Fury,\\" Dai Shi opened a portal to the Spirit World and brought Toady back. He and Stingerella fought side by side and were defeated by the Rangers and their Masters. Naja * First Appearance: \\"A Taste In Poison\\" * Voice Actor: Richard Simpson A blue sash-wearing Rinshi that has the spirit of the Cobra. and the leader of the Five Fingers of Poison.

Naja sought to commit mutiny and revealed his intentions to Camille, offering her a place at his side. Naja uses one of his Life Talons to survive her attack before eventually defeating Camille. Soon after, Naja revived Rantipede and Gakko to aid him in defeating Dai Shi while he was meditating. However, Camelle's interference ruined the plan, and she was now able to counter Naja's attack. Though he offered Camille his power over life and death, she sliced off his last three Life Talons before destroying him. In \\"Now the Final Fury,\\" Dai Shi opened a portal to the Spirit World and brought Naja back. He was defeated by the Rangers and their Masters. =The Overlords= The three Overlords were a trio of demon warriors defeated and slain by the forces of good prior to the series, each with a bracelet that holds that Overlord's soul. Each one holds power over the levels of the world, namely sky, sea, and earth. After the 5 Fingers of Poison were destroyed, Dai Shi commands Camille to bring him the three bracelets of the Three Overlords and also to give him three remaining Life Talons she had taken from Naja, intending to resurrect the Overlords and increase his power through their teaching methods. They were all eventually destroyed until they were revived by Dai Shi for the final Beast War, but were destroyed again by the Power Rangers and the Pai Zhua Masters. Carnisoar Carnisoar is the Sky Overlord and the holder of the Hawk spirit, a master of aerial martial arts. He uses a halberd and feather shurikens in his attack. Intending to resurrect the Overlords to become stronger, Dai Shi chooses Carnisoar to be the first to Camille's dismay due to his brutal teaching methods. Upon his revival, Carnisoar took Jarrod into the past to eliminate every good deeds that he did as a child, making him stronger as a result. After this, Carnisoar returned to Dai Shi's hideout to begin the actual training, teaching Jarrod to harness his hatred as power until Jellica was revived. After Jarrod manages to beat Jellica, Carnisoar leaves Jarrod's training to her. He returned to help Jarrod kill the Rangers briefly, reviving the Black Shadow Guard. Carnisoar later sided with Grizzaka upon his revival, setting up the chamber to revive the Phantom Beast Generals after obtaining their Crystal Eyes for Grizaka. Once arriving at the Rhino Nexus with the other Overlords, where they ran afoul of the Power Rangers, Carnisoar fought Casey, Theo, Lily, and RJ in his Illusion Dimension after withstanding the Claw Cannon. When Casey used his Tiger Instincts to find the real Carnisoar and attacked him before Carnisoar grew and fought the Wolf Pride Megazord and the Jungle Master Megazord. Carnisoar managed to overwhelm them until Dominic arrived in the Steel Rhino Zord. Before he was destroyed at the hands of the Rhino Pride Megazord, he tells them that they may defeated him, but the \\"war is far from over.\\" He was revived by Dai Shi for the final Beast War, but was destroyed again by the Power Rangers and the Pai Zhua Masters. Carnisoar is voiced by Cameron Rhodes. =Bai Lai= * First Appearance: \\"Blind Leading the Blind\\" * Voice Actor: Josh Thomson A crow monster with no Rinshi Form. He is the servant of Carnisoar. Carden and him created a vortex that would wipe out the entire city. They grew giant and beat the Jungle Pride Megazord because they could fly and avoid even the Elephant's power. Bai Lai targeted Lily, playing unfair. After learning from Master Swoop, Theo took them down with the Jungle Fan. They grew again, and the Rangers destroyed Bai Lai using the Jungle Pride with Bat Power. His broadsword was the only remnant of Bai Lai left and Carden became attached to the item. =Carden= * First Appearance: \\"Blind Leading the Blind\\" * Voice Actor: Gregory Cooper A crane monster with no Rinshi form.

In \\"Pushed to the Edge,\\" he faced down Lily and was beaten by her. As a giant, he was easily defeated by the Jungle Pride Megazord with Bat Power. Jellica Jellica is the Sea Overlord and the holder of the Jellyfish spirit, a staff wielding mistress who can neutralize her opponents' physical attacks by having them pass right through her as she can turn into water. She is revived by Camille so Dai Shi can train under her instead of Carnisoar. However, at first, she forced Camille to be her student and has her attack the Rangers after she personally defeated the Jungle Pride Megazord without trouble. But when Camille couldn't follow her orders, she attacked her with Lily going to her aid followed by Jarrod, who defeats Jellica in a brief fight. By then, she reveals that her mentoring of Camille was a test to see if Dai Shi truly desired her power, becoming Jarrod's new mentor, teaching him to harness his deceit as power. She helped Jarrod and Carnisoar to try killing the Rangers by reviving the White Shadow Guard. She refers to Camille as \\"Lizard\\". When Grizzaka was revived, Jellica sided with him, probably out of fear. During the events at the Rhino Nexus, Jellica battles Dominic and overwhelms him with her abilities until he made a comeback and forced her to retreat. While Grizzaka was fighting Theo, Lily, RJ, and Dominic, Jellica attempted to steal the Crystal Eyes while Jarrod was preoccupied with his fight with Casey. But after Grizzaka's destruction, Jellica reveals she managed to reclaim the three she and Carnisoar gathered for Grizzaka, reviving the Phantom Beast Generals to take over Dai Shi's throne out of spite for him. However, she ends up being destroyed by the three Phantom Beast Generals instead. She was revived by Dai Shi for the final Beast War, but was destroyed again by the Power Rangers and the Pai Zhua Masters. Jellica is voiced by Elisabeth Easther. Grizzaka In the episode of Bad To the Bone Grizzaka is the Land Overlord and holder of the Grizzly Bear spirit, master of the power of Zocato that makes him the strongest of the Overlords. He also wears gloves that can sprout claws from the back of his hands. After Dai Shi's defeat by the Jungle Master Red Ranger, Carnisoar and Jellica send Camille to revive Grizzaka to increase Dai Shi's power. Carnisoar and Jellica conspire to retrieve Grizzaka from the cave of darkness to their temple. However, being short-tempered, Grizzaka blames Dai Shi for losing the Beast War centuries ago and hates humans even more. Once revived by Camille, whom he attacked until she pleas him to come with her, RJ becomes a Wolf Man as Lily refuses to listen to RJ demands and leave Lily continues to confront Fran to restore Lily back to normal Lily as a biker girl rejoins the rangers to destroy Porcupongo in the Jungle Master Megazord Grizzaka overthrows Dai Shi because of his current status as a human and becomes the new leader with Carnisoar and Jellica switching loyalties out of fear of their well being. While sending out Rinshi Beasts to battle the rangers, Grizzaka attempts gather the Crystal Eyes to release the Phantom Beasts from their prison. After Jellica captured Jarrod, he ended up in a fight with Jarrod where during the fight, he mentioned that the Control Dagger before defeating Jarrod with his Zocato. After Jarrod and Camille escaped to the Rhino Nexus, Grizaka took Carnisoar and Jellica to catch up to the two. Upon running afoul of the Power Rangers, Grizzaka managed to defeat the Jungle Master Megazord, in both Bat Power and Shark Power forms, before ending up occupied by the Sand Snakes that guarded the Rhino Nexus. When Jarrod returned to the temple, Grizzaka was defeated by the man's refined Zocato and forced to relinquish his leadership. Grizzaka left to gather fear in Ocean Bluff so he can return to power. Grizzaka then fought the Power Rangers while Casey tried to reclaim the Crystal Eyes from Jarrod. Grizzaka was overwhelming them until Casey arrived. Casey used a combination of the Claw Booster and Dominic's Rhino Morpher to fight Grizzaka before the Rangers use a Claw Cannon/Wolf Morpher/Rhino Blade combo to take him down. Grizzaka grows and the Rangers form the Jungle Master Megazord and the Wolf Pride Megazord. Grizzaka overwhelmed the Megazords until Dominic brings out the Rhino Pride Megazord. Grizzaka then fights the Rhino Pride Megazord and is taken down. The Rangers then charged him down with their new Jungle Stampede formation.

They battled the Rangers and were able to overwhelm both Lily and Theo. Casey arrived and used a satellite dish to deflect the blast. Casey then used the Jungle Cruiser to attack them, followed by RJ using a double team with Casey. With a combo of the Wolf Beam and the Claw Cannon, the Shadow Guards were defeated. Grizzaka used the power of Zocato to make them grow. The Jungle Master Megazord and the Wolf Zord were having a difficult time defeating them. RJ summoned the Tiger and Jaguar Zords to form the Wolf Pride Megazord. The Wolf Pride Megazord defeated one of the Shadow Guards while the Jungle Master Megazord destroyed the other. In \\"Now the Final Fury\\" Dai Shi opened a portal to the Spirit World and summoned these two Shadow Guards once again to battle the Rangers. =Rinshi= The Rinshi are Dai Shi's army of spear wielding Jiangshi-like foot soldiers used to attack the city and they move by hopping with their arms forward. Rinshi Beasts Certain Rinshi are enhanced by Dai Shi, gaining a new attire and an animal signature on the forehead. These Rinshi can assume the forms of the Rinshi Beasts who fight in the manner of the animal spirit they possess. The Rinshis can grow by gathering fear. After they are destroyed, they normally turn to dust. * Mantor (voiced by Pat Courtenay) - A Rinshi who holds the spirit of the praying mantis. * Buffalord (voiced by Scott Alexander Young) - A Rinshi who holds the spirit of the buffalo. He uses his powerful horns that can bust through thick walls for attacks. * Pangolin (voiced by Charlie McDermott) - A Rinshi who holds the spirit of the animal with the same name.

As a ball, his armour is virtually impregnable, even for the Jungle Pride Megazord's Savage Spin. * Slickagon (voiced by Robert Mignault) - A Rinshi who holds the spirit of the eel. He is an old friend of Camille who she summoned to help her in her attack on the city. In his beast form, he was covered with shiny slime and spread his slippery slime throughout the city. * Crustaceo (voiced by Chris Stewart) - A hermit crab monster with no Rinshi form.

His plan was to 'cancel' all of the Jungle Fury Rangers every time a Rinshi Beast got a question right, or when one of the Rangers themselves got a question wrong. His plans are foiled however, when Casey retrieves his remote and transports him and his teammates back to the real world. His name implies that his animal spirit is that of the mouse. * Fox Monster - A fox monster with no rinshi form.

Though Jellica revives them, the three of them destroy her in an act of treachery to swear their allegiance to Jarrod/Dai Shi offering their warriors to his cause while asking Dai Shi to become their Phantom Beast King. He initially turns them down as they previously been his enemies but orders them to bring Master Phant, Master Swoop and Master Finn to prove their loyalty, creating the Spirit Rangers from the masters' animal spirits. They, along with Camille being made into a Phantom Beast General, have motifs based on the Four Sacred Beasts. They were all eventually destroyed until they were revived by Dai Shi for the final Beast War, but were destroyed again by the Power Rangers and the Pai Zhua Masters. Scorch Scorch is a Phantom Beast who holds the spirit of the Avalon Dragon, emerging from the Crystal Eye that represents it. He kidnapped Master Swoop and used his Rinzin Power and the Crystal Eye to turn Master Swoop's animal spirit into the Bat Spirit Ranger. Scorch joined Jarrod/Dai Shi, Camille, Whiger, and Snapper in fighting the Rangers and easily defeated them. After Whiger was stripped of rank and destroyed, Scorch started to doubt Dai Shi's ability to suppress his human host due to Camille. This led to he and Snapper both secretly scheming to do something about it, from sabotaged Camille's plan with Grinder to sending Sonimax, Osiris, and Lepus to assassinate her. It was after the three failed, that Dai Shi beats Scorch while assuring him he's still in control. When Jarrod breaks free, Scorch is sent by Dai Shi to destroy both him and Camille, only to be defeated by the Jungle Pride Charge with Lion and Chameleon Power. He survived to spearhead Dai Shi's army for the final battle, easily defeating RJ and Dominic, along Masters Phant, Swoop and Finn, before being destroyed by the Rangers' Triple Claw attack. He was revived by Dai Shi for the final Beast War, but was destroyed again by the Power Rangers and the Pai Zhua Masters. Scorch is voiced by Mark Wright. Snapper Snapper is a Phantom Beast General with a Snake/Basilisk-motif who holds the spirit of the Snapping Turtle, emerging from the Crystal Eye that represents it. Snapper possesses Rinzin that alters the gravity around him, using it to render his opponents powerless to its effects. Lily first encountered him trying to kidnap Master Phant and Snapper overwhelmed her. He then made off with Master Phant. Snapper appeared in the battle between the Megazords and Sonimax. Snapper then used his gravitational Rinzin Power to easily defeat the Megazords and he takes his leave with Sonimax. Snapper then used his Rinzin Power and the Crystal Eye to turn Master Phant's animal spirit into the Elephant Spirit Ranger. He alongside Jarrod/Dai Shi, Camille, and Scorch joined Whiger in fighting the Rangers and easily defeated the Rangers. After Whiger had his Rinzin stolen from him, and was stripped of his rank and destroyed, Snapper begins to secretly aid Scorch in his plot against Camille for Dai Shi's sake. Later when Jarrod breaks free of Dai Shi, Snapper aids Scorch in hunting down him and Camille, only to be destroyed by her and the other rangers while Casey and Jarrod battle Scorch. He was revived by Dai Shi for the final Beast War, but was destroyed again by the Power Rangers and the Pai Zhua Masters. Snapper is voiced by Richard Simpson. Whiger Whiger is a chimeric Phantom Beast who holds the spirit of the White Tiger, emerging from the Crystal Eye that represents it. He kidnapped Master Finn and used his Rinzin Power and the Crystal Eye to turn Master Finn's animal spirit into the Shark Spirit Ranger. After the Spirit Rangers were freed from the Phantom Beast Generals' control, Jarrod/Dai Shi noticed that Whiger's spirit is similar to the Red Ranger's. Jarrod/Dai Shi uses him to redeem the Phantom Beast by taking Casey's Tiger Spirit. He succeeded in getting it for Dai Shi after a scuffle with RJ. Whiger proves his victory to Jarrod/Dai Shi by sparring with him (thus allowing Dai Shi to accept the Generals). Whiger called a fight with Casey, but ended up fighting RJ, Theo, Lily, and Dominic until Jarrod/Dai Shi, Camille, and the other Phantom Beast Generals arrive and easily defeat the Rangers. Whiger attacked the city and Casey ran into him. Casey tried to transform without his Tiger Spirit and ended up fighting the other Rangers. Casey finally transforms and joins the fight. With the help of Jimmy, the Rangers charged up the Claw Cannon to use on Whiger. Whiger grows and fights the Wolf Pride Megazord, the Rhino Pride Megazord, and Jungle Master Megazord, losing to them when they form the Jungle Master Stampede. Dai Shi did not take the news of Whiger's defeat lightly. He stripped Whiger of his Rinzin, title, and rank before banishing Whiger from the temple. Whiger tried to kill Casey, for robbing him of his honor only to be saved by the human when he fell off a cliff. Deciding to return his kindness, Whiger lead Casey to where Rammer and Badrat were holding everyone captive, including the other rangers. While battling Camille, Whiger gave Casey back his tiger spirit and the two performed a double attack on Camille (with Whiger manifesting a white version of Casey's Tiger Spirit) forcing her to leave in defeat. However, the fight depleted the last of Whiger's Rinzin causing him to fade out of existence but not from Casey's memory. Whiger is voiced by Jared Turner. =Phantom Beasts= The eight Phantom Beasts were a notorious race of mythology-based monsters back in the \\"Beast War\\", who not only attacked humans but attempted to overthrow Dai Shi. They are able to generate Rinzin, a power that surpasses Zocato. The Pai Zhua masters sealed them away in the Crystal Eyes and these items are what can bring them back to life under a star alignment. Five of the Crystal Eyes were found by Dr. Silvia Jennings and ended up in the possession of the Power Rangers; the generals contained within them were thus never released. The lower-ranking Phantom Beasts are servants of the Phantom Beast Generals and are not in the same category as the Rinshi Beasts. They have motifs based on the Earthly Branches and are modeled after a mythical creature. Sonimax * First Appearance: \\"Fear and the Phantoms\\" * Voice Actor: John Callen A Pig-motif Phantom Beast Warrior who holds the spirit of the Catoblepas. Sonimax uses a sound-based Rinzin attack.

Jungle Master Megazord, Wolf Pride Megazord, and Rhino Pride Megazord were formed. Sonimax was too tough for the Megazords until Lily summoned the Elephant Zord to form the Jungle Master Megazord with Elephant Power. Snapper entered the battle and defeated the Megazords. Sonimax retreated with Snapper. In \\"To Earn Your Stripes,\\" he, Lepus, and Osiris were sent by Snapper and Scorch to kill Camille, making them believe she conspired against Dai Shi and Dai Shi ordered it to be done.

This study has been inspired by Regional Systems Analysis (RSA) and the study of Hierarchical Regional Space (HRC) and Macroregions 宏區域 developed by G. William Skinner 施堅雅. Definition of RRS A preliminary definition is provided in the article by Wu, Tong and Ryavec: A Regional Religious System is a type of spatial formation in which a group of related or unrelated religious institutions are conditioned by physical, geographical, administrative, cultural, or socioeconomic systems and are highly dependent on regionally and locally distributed variables such as economy, transportation, education, culture, ethnicity, and language, etc.Jiang Wu, Daoqin Tong. and Karl Ryavec, “Spatial Analysis and GIS Modeling of Regional Religious Systems in China: Conceptualization and Initial Experiment.” In Chinese History in Geographical Perspective, edited by Yongtao Du and Jeff Kyong-McClain. Lanham: Lexington Books, 2013. pp. 179-196. According to their study, RRS is basically a spatial formation characterized by the geographical distribution of religious sites. The formation of RRS is shaped by regional systems such as William Skinner's Macroregions. Also, the distribution of these sites relies on regionally and locally distributed factors. GIS Modeling of RRS: Methodology and Sources GIS modeling of RRS focuses on the distribution of Buddhist sites in Chinese history because of the persistent presence of Buddhism in Chinese culture and history. This study is based on the assumption that “Chinese Buddhist institutions are fundamentally local institutions and temple-building activities are spontaneous endeavors initiated at the local level by harnessing local resources.” The research team first studied the distribution of religious sites by implementing the kernel density estimation in ArcGIS. A series of density maps were generated based on three major datasets ranging from Buddhist institutions in Han Chinese areas (including Taiwan) from the Tang and Five Dynasties period, the Qing Dynasty period, and the contemporary period. Second, the research team conducted similar analysis in non-Han Chinese areas such as the Tibetan Plateau and Mosques in Muslim areas. Third, these mapping results are compared with Macroregion maps William Skinner created. (These maps are available online at G. William Skinner Map Collection at University of Washington Library. Findings High levels of correlation are found between these density maps and Skinner's Macroregions. First, clusterings of Buddhist sites are found in most of Skinner's Macroregions. Second, density maps create natural boundaries overlapping with those of Skinner's Macroregions. Third, the distribution of transportation routes greatly impacted the distribution of Buddhist sites. Finally, the distribution pattern clearly shows a core-periphery relationship. Based on these initial findings, the Greater China area has been delineated into ten RRSs.

RPM Rangers The RPM Power Rangers (or Ranger Operators) protect the city of Corinth, the last human outpost, from destruction. Each Ranger has an \\"operation number\\" sewn on their jacket, or leg in the case of Gold and Silver. Scott, Flynn and Summer made a cameo in the flashback in Power Rangers Beast Morphers. =Scott Truman= Scott Truman is the Ranger Operator Series Red, alternately referred to as Red Ranger. His operation number is one. His zord is the Eagle Racer which is a combination of a race car and an eagle. He is the confident, stubborn-headed and slightly cocky leader of the RPM team with a love of fast cars. He takes his job as leader of the Rangers seriously, and tends not to trust new recruits until they've made an effort to earn said trust. He does, however, make an effort to help keep the team together if there ever seems to be an issue. Prior to the present day, Scott served as a pilot in the Air Force defenses during the battle for Corinth City, using the code-name Eagle 2.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"The Road to Corinth\\" He was often overshadowed by his more talented and more experienced older brother, Marcus Truman, lost in the battle for Corinth, code-named Eagle 1. His father, Colonel Mason Truman, often wanted him to act as a support to his brother as he believed that Scott was not ready to handle the front lines. During the battle of Corinth, both brothers were shot down. Scott managed to eject in time and was rescued by Summer, but his brother was killed.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Ranger Red\\" At some point during the following year, he was chosen to be a Ranger, using technology designed by Dr. K to keep Corinth safe and stop any assaults by Venjix.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Fade to Black\\" Dillon and Ziggy began associating with the team around this time, to Scott's initial disapproval, as he was at first convinced that Dillon was neither trustworthy nor capable of handling the Series Black tech. After several initial spats, Dillon proved to Scott that he could be trusted,Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Rain\\" but Scott was equally off-put by Ziggy taking the Series Green tech not long after, especially since Ziggy didn't come close to meeting any of the basic physical or skill requirements needed to become a Ranger. However, with the two additional Rangers now being necessary to stop more extravagant plans by Venjix, Scott is, at the very least, accepting of their contributions.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Go for the Green\\" Despite this, or perhaps in compensation for this, Scott has since developed something of a rivalry with Dillon, due to their similarly stubborn, dominating personalities and Dillon's defiant tendencies. The pair are often seen trying to outdo each other, especially when it comes to their cars.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Brother's Keeper\\" However, he seems to have grown a friendship with Ziggy, as the two are often seen together when off-duty. Scott Truman appears in a crossover special of Power Rangers Samurai by himself but only in morphed form, fearing he would not be able to breathe in the atmosphere of the Samurai Ranger's universe. Sometime during the war in Corinth, Scott followed Professor Cog into the Power Rangers Samurai dimension in order to prevent him from polluting Corinth City with the water of the Sanzu River. He saved the Samurai Rangers from Venjix robots causing the Yellow and Pink Samurai Rangers to like him while the Red, Green, and Blue Samurai Rangers are jealous of him. There he assisted the Samurai Rangers in defeating Professor Cog and the massive Mooger army led by General Gut. He also had access to the Samurai Ranger's Shark Attack Mode by putting the Power Disk onto his Nitro Sword. As Darville had joined the Screen Actors Guild since working on RPM (as part of his work on the television series Terra Nova), his voice work in the teamup was credited to the pseudonym Tobias Reiss. After the war, Colonel Truman, finally knowing his son's worth as a leader, offers Scott the leader position of Eagle Squad. He accepts, and recruits Gem and Gemma to join him.Power Rangers RPM: episode \\"Danger and Destiny Part 2\\" He is portrayed by Eka Darville. =Flynn McAllistair= Flynn McAllistair is the Ranger Operator Series Blue, alternately referred to as Blue Ranger and is the second-in-command of the Ranger Operators. His operation number is two. His zord is the Lion Hauler which is a combination of a hauler truck and a lion. A Scotsman, Flynn is generally laid-back in personality. As a mechanic, he often spends time working on his personal vehicle, a Hummer H1, and is proficient at making smoothies. He uses his basic skills and knowledge of devices and appliances to help out with technological tasks if ever need be, even once rivaling Dr. K's understanding of the Ranger technology, as well as creating an entirely new Zord with Gemma's assistance. While Flynn was a mechanic by trade, a skill taught to him by his father, Flynn expressed a strong desire to help others like the superheroes in the comic books he read so much as a child. After graduating high school, he finally got that chance, much to the displeasure of his father, who insisted superheroes didn't exist. Not realizing the full responsibilities of such a line of work, his passion for helping others tended to get in the way as he usually overdid his jobs, (ex. spraying water into a burning building until it received unnecessary water damage, and then wanting to run back into said building to save the plants), and as a result, was fired from all of them. As soon as Venjix attacked, both he and his father fled to Corinth, but Flynn shortly after went to save a bus-full of people still outside the city, and skillfully managed to make it unharmed back to Corinth. His act of heroism earned him acceptance from his father, who finally realized that was what his son was meant to do. His dream of becoming a superhero finally came true when he was selected to become Ranger Operator Series Blue.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Ranger Blue\\" Dillon and Ziggy's arrival resulted in feelings of distrust from Flynn, due to the nature of Dillon's mechanical upgrades, but Flynn was still clearly less antagonistic than Scott over the matter, willing to allow Dillon on board if the group consensus felt it was best. Ziggy joining the team produced quite a bit more incredulity in him, however. Despite any early feelings of doubt, he seems to have since fully embraced the two as members of the team. He also accepts Gem and Gemma when they are added to the team.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Not So Simple\\" Despite his friendly personality, he is also very serious about his role as a Power Ranger always insisting to go out on the field and defeat Venjix. It becomes very tortuous to him when he is unable to be mobilized or is restrained from performing his duties for any reason. After the war, Flynn reveals that he and his father will be building new computer systems for Corinth. He would later travel with his teammates to the dimension of the Super Megaforce Rangers in order to join in the final battle with the Warstar Armada. He is portrayed by Ari Boyland. =Summer Landsdown= Summer Landsdown is the Ranger Operator Series Yellow, alternately referred to as Yellow Ranger. Her operation number is three. Her zord is the Bear Crawler, which is a combination of a bear and an ATV.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"In or Out\\"Power Rangers RPM episode \\"The Dome Dolls\\" She is a skilled combatant and proficient at martial arts. She has a kind personality, willing to trust others and give them the benefit of the doubt, even when no one else is willing to. She isn't above getting down to business when necessary, however. She is also skilled at and enjoys riding motorcycles, but does enjoy riding the boys' cars as well. Summer did not start off kind or caring, as she once was a rich and spoiled heiress, with constantly absent parents; when Venjix forces attacked on her birthday, she was abandoned by her equally-spoiled friends and long-suffering staff during the evacuation.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Ranger Yellow Part 1\\" While wandering aimlessly in search for help, she was found by her butler Andrews, who then helped to escort her to Corinth. Along the way, Summer gained a better understanding and view on what he'd done for her, and she begins to return the favor. Some miles away from Corinth, they were ambushed by Grinders, and Andrews was killed protecting her, forcing her to grow past her formerly spoiled personality. She eventually finds her way to Corinth on her own and reunites with her parents. After hearing a report of a pilot shot down, she decides to go out again to find him.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Ranger Yellow Part 2\\" She found a downed Scott and helped him return to Corinth before the city's shielding went up, making her rescue of Scott her first significant act of goodwill. By the present day, she was serving as the Yellow Ranger alongside Scott and Flynn. Her parents, initially distressed that Summer had accepted the assignment as the Yellow Ranger, eventually acknowledge and accept the person she had become. When Dillon and Ziggy arrived in Corinth and were subsequently jailed, it was Summer who first considered Dillon a suitable operator for the Series Black tech, and decided to trust him even while Scott and Flynn could not. While the three Rangers together were able to convince him to join up, Summer's words in particular later on were instrumental to keeping him from leaving. As time passed, Summer continued to show support for Dillon in his quest to find himself and his sister. When Dillon and Summer became trapped inside a burning building in an attempt to find his sister, they started to realize that they had feelings for one another. They moved to kiss, but were interrupted twice: the first time when the Whale Zord's water spouts drenched them as it put out the fire, and the second time immediately after, when Gem and Gemma burst into the building to find them.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Belly of the Beast\\" After the war, Summer left Corinth with Dillon and Tenaya to explore the world, now no longer tainted by the pollution from Venjix. There they see the fruits of their victory, a newly restored land and the hope that the Earth will be fully restored one day. She would subsequently appear as part of the Ranger army in the finale of Super Megaforce helping the Megaforce Rangers fight the Warstar Armada. She is portrayed by Rose McIver. =Ziggy Grover= Ziggy Grover is the Ranger Operator Series Green, alternately referred to as Green Ranger. His zord is the Tail Spinner zord which is a combination of an orca and a scooter. His operation number is four. He is generally clumsy, wacky, silly, and a bit of a coward, but for what he lacks in skill and physical prowess, he makes up for with heart. He is energetic, enthusiastic, and relentlessly (at times stupid) optimistic, which often leaves him on the receiving end of Dr. K's blunt verbal insults. He usually wants to stay out of trouble, but won't hesitate to help the other Rangers. Before becoming a Ranger, he was an associate of Fresno Bob, the boss of the Scorpion Cartel, a well known crime family. Clumsy even back then, he would often fail missions, but continued to work under Fresno Bob in order to help support an orphanage full of children with \\"child gamma sickness\\". One day, Ziggy and a truck Fresno Bob had entrusted to him disappeared from Corinth, thus giving a reason for many criminals to target him.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Ranger Green\\" Ziggy had discovered the truck was full of $5 million worth of medical supplies, which he secretly diverted to the orphanage. With the help of one of his friends, he then fled Corinth. It was outside that he met Dillon, and after failing to hijack his car, decided to escort him back to the city. Ziggy views Dillon as his best friend and was the first person to help Dillon search for his sister, later joined by Summer. When Fresno Bob's men intensified their search for him, Ziggy started to become more concerned about his well-being. He is later kidnapped by Tenaya 15 and is the ante for a favor with Fresno Bob. Despite that. Ziggy rescues Fresno Bob after he is double-crossed by Tenaya; because of this, Fresno Bob absolves Ziggy of his debt.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Run Ziggy Run\\" Ziggy, unlike the other Rangers, was never tested and is the least capable to use the Ranger tech. His becoming a Ranger was the result of a desperate effort to keep the Series Green morpher from Tenaya 7; he felt that the best way to keep the morpher away from her was to bond with it himself, thus becoming Ranger Green. His unauthorized bonding with the morpher initially did not sit well with Dr. K and the other Rangers, except for Dillon, due to his obvious incompetence at the beginning. Since then, however, he has been steadily showing signs of improvement, proving to be a helpful -though clumsy- ally, able to hold his own quite well in combat situations, morphed or not. He even started bringing his once problematic transportation powers under control, once heroically diving off the top of a skyscraper to save Dillon by way of teleporting both of them mid-descent to ground level safely. Dr. K initially found Ziggy to be quite annoying, and she was openly hostile to him. Even after she begins to open up upon Gem and Gemma's return, she remains frosty to him, often refusing to call him by name as she began to do with the other Rangers. Ziggy, however, seems attracted to Dr. K; in the episode \\"Dome Dolls\\", he admitted to her he had a dream where he was on a date with her. He has also expressed a mild attraction towards Tenaya 7, once stating, \\"When she's not pounding us into the pavement, she's kind of a hottie.\\"Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Beyond A Doubt\\" Soon enough, it becomes obvious that Dr. K does actually think well of Ziggy; she accidentally once called him by his first name in front of Gemma and even named her password after him, which Summer figured out (though she lied to the other Rangers about it to keep Dr. K's secret safe).Power Rangers RPM episode \\"If Venjix Won\\" When Ziggy and Dr. K were teleported to a cave with little oxygen, he managed to get her to smile by doing a shadow puppet show for her. When Venjix took over the city, he immediately got extremely concerned and left the other Rangers to protect Dr. K and stayed with her when the others went after Venjix. After the war, Ziggy and Dr. K announce they are opening a children's school, where Dr. K will teach biofield physics and Ziggy will teach shadow puppetry and cooking. She also finally refers to Ziggy by his first name, saying that since he is no longer a Ranger, she needs to call him something. She also seems to be able to finally admit to her feelings for him, or at least tolerate his feelings for her, allowing Ziggy to put his arm around her. Ziggy later joined his teammates in traveling to the main universe's Earth in Super Megaforce to join an army of Power Rangers who fought against the Warstar Armada. He is portrayed by Milo Cawthorne. =Dillon= Dillon is the Ranger Operator Series Black, alternately referred to as Black Ranger by his peers, and Subject D-44 by associates of Venjix. His operation number is five. His zord is the Wolf Cruiser which is a combination of a police car and a wolf. He is aloof and somewhat withdrawn, a bit of a lone wolf among his fellow Rangers. Despite this, he has a kinder side. He does not hesitate to help whenever anyone is in danger, and has even personally defended Ziggy, Summer, and to some extent, Scott. While distrustful of others, he agrees to help Dr. K and the other Rangers protect Corinth. He drives a black car called the 'Fury' which throws fire from its silencers. He can be gruff and has a bit of a rebellious side, and often criticizes and talks sarcastically to Dr. K and the Rangers, similar to Tenaya 7's defiance of Venjix. In the start of the series, he was seen outside of Corinth, wandering the wasteland-like world in search of the city without any memory of his past, not even knowing his own name. It was there that he was confronted by Ziggy attempting to rob him, and together they drive to Corinth. He and Ziggy were arrested on sight as Dillon was found with Venjix technology in his body, enhancing his physical capabilities to superhuman levels, making him a perfect candidate as Ranger Operator Series Black. Though hesitating at first, he eventually came to terms about what he would be protecting and decided to join the other Rangers. Dillon's past is an absolute mystery. The only clues he has to his former life are his technological enhancements, a musical pocket watch he carries on him at all times, and several strange recurring dreams of a blind, unknown girl who, along with him, is under the custody of Venjix. He even once attempted to leave Corinth in attempt to search out the missing pieces of his past. Upon hearing a distress call from the other Rangers, he decided he needed to stay and dropped his previous plans of leaving in order to help his teammates out. His dreams were proven to be of merit when a Venjix Attack Bot called Sat Bot, who had appeared in one of his dreams, showed up and had claimed to have wiped, and still possess, Dillon's memories. Before being destroyed by Dillon after his initial hesitation to do so, the Sat Bot activated a virus in Dillon's mechanical implants designed to make them grow until they take control of him, and Dr. K says there is no cure.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Blitz\\" Venjix intends to use this virus to eventually bring Dillon under his control. After undergoing hypnotherapy, he finds memories of an area called Kenmore located in Omega City, evacuated after the first Venjix attack. However, it was soon discovered the memories were implanted on purpose so Venjix could lure the Rangers into a trap.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Embodied\\" Dillon later finds out that the blind girl in his dreams is his sister, who had been held prisoner at a Grinder-building factory. After investigating the factory, Summer finds a key matching the one Dillon has for his pocket watch, though to Dillon's dismay, it does nothing.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Prisoners\\" When Dillon and Summer became trapped inside a burning building in an attempt to find his sister, they started to realize that they had feelings for one another. They moved to kiss, but were interrupted twice: the first time when the Whale Zord's water spouts drenched them as it put out the fire, and the second time immediately after, when Gem and Gemma burst into the building to find them. Scott later informs Dillon of the existence of a Venjix prison camp where his captives are being turned into human hybrids like him.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Heroes Among Us\\" Eventually he discovers that the two keys he possesses, when connected, cause his pocketwatch to play a different tune. When he realizes this new tune is the same one that Tenaya 7 whistles, he immediately seeks her out, and upon encountering her in the wasteland, plays the original pocketwatch tune to her. He finds Tenaya remembering it somehow, and Dillon confirms that Tenaya 7 is his lost sister who turned into a hybrid like him.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Key to the Past\\" At this point, he becomes extremely protective of her, having already lost her once to Venjix. After returning from their first fight in the RPM Ultrazord, he sees Kilobyte kidnap Tenaya and get away. Dillon, Flynn, Scott and Summer tried to find Venjix's Palace to save Tenaya, but the tracks Dillon and Tenaya had left from before faded away. However, during the Ranger's fight with Shifter, Dillon thought his sister had returned to him. She attacked Shifter as he had the Rangers on the ropes. However, when Dillon went to Tenaya (who was now Tenaya 15), he found that she only saw him as the enemy, and had no memories of before. Later, Dillon had a chance to try to get Tenaya back with the Control Key the Rangers got from inside Scott, but Dillon used the key to help save his friends instead. Dr. K then informed Dillon that the Venjix Virus inside of him had grown to 40%. Once it reaches 50%, he will lose control to Venjix, and there is no way for Dr. K to stop it.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Control - Alt - Delete\\" As Venjix began his final assault on Corinth, Dillon fought off the activation of his Venjix implants long enough to cure himself with Dr. K's newly developed antidote and subsequently do the same for Tenaya. When Kilobyte attacks Tenaya, he uses his invincibility shield to protect her, only to be overpowered by it. The blast froze his robotic implants, leaving him in a coma like state for the rest of the fight. He wakes up in time to rescue his sister from the destroyed control tower, parachuting both to safety. After the war, Dillon left Corinth with Summer and Tenaya to explore the world no longer tainted by the pollution from Venjix. There they see the fruits of their victory, a newly restored land and the hope that the Earth will be fully restored one day. He also leaves his pocket watch with Dr. K as a souvenir and finally thanks her for helping him. Some time later, he would appear as part of an army of Rangers in Super Megaforce who fought to protect Earth from the final attack of the Warstar Armada. Dillon is portrayed by Daniel Ewing. =Gem and Gemma= Gem and Gemma, twin brother and sister, are Ranger Operator Series Gold and Ranger Operator Series Silver, respectively. Their operation numbers are seven and eight. Gem drives the Falcon zord which is a combination of a falcon and a helicopter and Gemma drives the Tiger Jet which is a combination of a tiger and a fighter jet. They were raised to be test pilots of the Ranger Operator suits and equipment, where they met Dr. K and eventually became her first friends. The twins are a cheery duo, having an abundance of energy and high spirits. Despite their demeanor, Gem and Gemma are highly trained and skilled fighters, and able to very effectively take part in combat. When Alphabet Soup attempted to assassinate Dr. K, Gem and Gemma rescued her by swiftly knocking out her captors, then helped her escape. They attempted to retrieve the classified Ranger Gold and Ranger Silver morphers, but an explosion seemingly killed them in front of Dr. K.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Doctor K\\" Mysterious Gold and Silver Rangers later appeared twice to save the core Rangers from Venjix's new body. Afterward, they all returned to Corinth, where they revealed their identities and were reunited with an excited and teary-eyed Dr. K.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Ghosts\\" Their Rangers suits, being experimental at the time they were created, do not have the same properties that the other Rangers do. For instance, they cannot manipulate their biospheres like the other five, and the suits themselves have a pilot's jumpsuit design to fit their aircraft Zord design. This includes their wing-like cuffs on the suit which, unlike the wheel or gear (in the case of Green and Black) cuff design on the others, does not spin. Before reuniting with Dr. K and meeting the Rangers, Gem and Gemma were out in the wasteland on an offensive campaign against Venjix. Because they were out on this campaign for so long, they have a \\"shoot first, ask questions later\\" type strategy, which greatly disturbs the more passive Colonel Truman, as well as earns them the nickname \\"The Boom Twins\\" by the other Rangers. This makes them trigger-happy, and they take very little time to plan, but more than make up for it with their fighting skills. The twins rarely separate from one another, and it often seems as though they share the same brain, or at least think very similarly, since they always end up finishing each other's sentences, but there have been times where they have had their own individual thoughts. They also have a childlike demeanor, sometimes adding sound effects while explaining their plans, leaving colorful notes and giving maps where the directions are shown as rainbows and unicorns. At some point during their time on the run, they were forced to work in a Grinder-building factory, at which point they met a blind girl they would later learn was Dillon's sister. While the both of them act relatively simple- mindedly and childishly, Gem and Gemma have a genius IQ possibly equal to that of Dr. K as they can easily understand quantum mechanics.Power Rangers RPM episode \\"Three's A Crowd\\" After spending their time with the other Rangers, they eventually grew closer to them and work with the team, rather than just each other, even managing to restrain themselves from simply blowing things up until its necessary. After the war, Gem and Gemma join Eagle Squadron, now under Scott's leadership, obviously recommended for the posting because of their experience with their aircraft Zords. They seem to be quite excited about their new posting, saying that they \\"get to blow things up, and get paid for it.\\" They would later appear as part of the Ranger teams who joined together in the finale of Super Megaforce to help the Megaforce Rangers fight the Warstar Armada. Gemma returned in Super Ninja Steel. Gem is portrayed by Mike Ginn while Gemma is portrayed by Li Ming Hu. Allies=Doctor K= Doctor K is the Ranger's mentor who created their technology and also the Venjix technology. She is extremely sensitive about the Ranger suits, and gets hostile if someone calls them or even refers to the suits as spandex. She is a teenage genius and also musically inclined, using the violin and keyboard when working and even using them in conjunction with some of her equipment. Although her identity was initially obscured by her speaking through a computer screen and distorting her voice (the Rangers referred to K as \\"he\\"), the Rangers later learned that she is actually a teenage girl. It is revealed throughout the series that she was the creator of the Venjix virus when she was abducted by the \\"Alphabet Soup\\" government think tank. As a result of her upbringing, she no longer knows her own name (\\"K\\" is her government code name), rarely ever leaves her base of operations, is socially inept (as demonstrated by her bluntness with others), and initially only refers to the Rangers by their colors instead of their given names. After the arrival of Gem and Gemma, she becomes more emotionally open, tries a more encouraging approach with her methods, and has begun to occasionally refer to each Ranger by name - with the exception of Ziggy, much to his chagrin. But later in the series she becomes closer to him. He also made her smile for the first time in a long time. However, she does still apparently think better of him, as she stated, \\"The five of you are the only family I've ever known. I love you all.\\" It's also repeatedly hinted that, despite how she acts towards him, she does care more for him than she does the others, even making his name her password for her computer. While she is by no means a physical fighter, she can defend herself with her weapons and wits, as well as an enhanced violin. Despite her phlegmatic demeanor, Doctor K has shown an affinity for cute things, as seen by her Zord designs, puppy slippers and pajamas. Ziggy has also stated that she has a sweet tooth especially with Mr Marshmallow, which contrasts from her rather sour personality. After the war, she plans to open a children's school with Ziggy, also calling him by his real name, saying she has to call him something other than Ranger Series Green. Doctor K appears on Power Rangers Beast Morphers as she contacts Devon to discuss any means to separate his father Mayor Daniels from Evox. After learning that Evox and Venjix were one in the same, she briefly travels to the Beast Morphers' dimension to assist Nate before returning back to her dimension to assess the situation of Venjix regaining a foothold within the RPM universe. She did suggest to Devon to use the Split Emitter that was once used on Doomwing and Snide. Doctor K is portrayed by Olivia Tennet. =Colonel Mason Truman= Colonel Mason Truman is Scott's father and the leader of Corinth's defense forces. Truman's relationship with his son is a strained one, as he seemingly favored his late son, Marcus, over Scott. Even after Scott's recruitment as Ranger Red, Truman is still overprotective of him. Although he does not express it openly, Truman is proud of Scott's accomplishments. Colonel Truman's primary strategy in the war against Venjix is a simple defensive one: staying behind the domed shielding while the Rangers as well as his forces take out any Venjix attackbots (Grinders) that breach the shields. Because of this, he often disapproves of any plans requiring going outside the dome, especially if it involves dropping the shields for any reason. However, he does give in under certain circumstances, such as acknowledging Scott's stubbornness or being threatened with a laxative that is ten times worse than the effects of dysentery by Doctor K. This attitude changes as soon as Doctor K reveals that hybrid humans created by Venjix are within Corinth, making him realize that they would not be in their present situation if they had taken a more proactive approach to the war. With this in mind, he assembles his troops to finish off Venjix, but are stopped by the hybrids and meets Venjix face to face where he is imprisoned along with the rest of Corinth. He continues to lead his troops after the war and gives Scott the leadership position in Eagle Squad. Truman later appears in the final episode of Power Rangers Beast Morphers where he alongside Betty and Ben Burke busted Scrozzle in the sewers of Corinth and handed him over to Devon Daniels who then sent Scrozzle to the Grid Battleforce's holding cell. Col. Truman is Portrayed by James Gaylyn. =Corporal Hicks= Corporal Hicks is Colonel Truman's aide-de-camp. While a capable soldier, he is curious and can be a bit clumsy, and is often seen absentmindedly fiddling with Doctor K's equipment. At the end of the season it was revealed that he was a hybrid infected with Venjix technology. His name is a reference to Michael Biehn's character in the 1986 film Aliens. Cpl. Hicks is portrayed by Damien Avery. =Vasquez= Vasquez is female officer working with Colonel Truman. She assisted Dr. K, Summer and Gemma when all of the men were knocked out in the city. At the end of the season it was revealed that she was a hybrid infected with Venjix technology. Her name is a reference to Jenette Goldstein's character in the 1986 film Aliens. Vasquez is portrayed by Mia Koning. =Benny= Benny is a friend of Ziggy's from his Scorpion Cartel days, who helped smuggle him out of the city and later set the record straight about why Ziggy vanished. Benny is portrayed by Murray Keane. Antagonists=Venjix= An aggressive self-aware, self-generating sentient computer virus AGI with an immortality-complex, Venjix was created by Dr. K on behalf of a secret government think tank known as Alphabet Soup. Dr. K eventually chose to release the virus into the Alphabet Soup facility servers as a diversion in the hopes that she would be able to escape her captors, but she was discovered and dragged away before she could install a firewall. Without a firewall to keep him contained in the facility, Venjix quickly spread through the world's computers and within three years had taken over the Earth's defense forces and data networks with the only safe haven being the domed city of Corinth. Lacking a corporeal form in of itself, as computer viruses are purely software based in nature, Venjix is initially seen manifesting his presence in the Venjix Palace through a large rotating technological pillar with a single red optic sensor. Eventually growing tired of the constant defeats, Venjix created a Generation-13 Attack Bot body to upload himself into so that he could personally battle the Rangers. The body itself possessed a calculus theme with protractors on the chest and units of measurement on his sword. Venjix also has a fail-safe in his programming, transferring his data into either the pillar or another standby body when destroyed, allowing his consciousness to survive the Rangers' destructive attacks. After one defeat too many, Venjix orders Shifter to upgrade his body and give him enough firepower to destroy the entire city. Before the process can be completed however, a city gate opens and Venjix orders the download be suspended even though the download is only at eighty percent. Venjix goes out to face the Rangers. Unfortunately, the body doesn't hold up as well as Venjix had hoped it would, and the robotic shell is damaged beyond repair by Scott as Shifter manages to get his master to safety. Following this, Venjix once again resides in his pillar as Shifter constructs the Generation-16 Hyperbot to serve as a new body. However, due to Tenaya's sabotage, the body was rejected and Shifter banished. Later, Venjix commissioned the creation of a new ultimate body, recycling the destroyed remains of Shifter (due to their unique metallic alloys) to complete it. The new body bears a slight resemblance to Shifter as it was recycled from his remains, but it is older looking and has black plating with gold accents. Venjix successfully takes over Corinth when Tenaya 15 activates the Hybrids. He meets Colonel Truman and imprisons him with the rest of Corinth. Venjix makes his way to the Ranger's base and finally meets Dr. K, his creator. After discussing how the machines are perfect in every way, Venjix imprisons Dr. K and Ziggy, and downloads the Ranger data from Dr. K's computer. Downloading this allowed him to personally manipulate the biosphere (aka the Morphin Grid), deleting two Megazords and even deleting Gem and Gemma. Venjix is confronted one last time by the original three rangers. Soon Venjix discovers that Dr. K, with the help of Tenaya, hacked into his system and uploaded a counter virus that deletes his grinders. Shortly after the biofield allows Gem and Gemma to be revived by Dr. K. They then shot down the control tower. The tower falls on Venjix, destroying his ultimate body. All of his factories are then immediately shut down as a result; clearing the air from the polluted wasteland and making the rest of the world habitable once more. Despite the destruction of his ultimate body, the exact fate of Venjix himself was left ambiguous to the viewers' interpretation due to the interaction of his base code interfacing with the Morphin Grid. The final episode of RPM ends with Dr. K securing the morphers inside a metal briefcase while Scott's morpher is shown on screen with one red light lit similar to the optic sensor of Venjix's pillar. It is later confirmed in the alternate reality of the series Power Rangers Beast Morphers that Venjix did indeed survive within the morpher. Through experimentation with the past Ranger teams' tech by a young Nate Silvia to create Grid Battle Force's Ranger tech a portion of Venjix's code is unknowingly released from the morpher. Now combined with Morph-X and the animal DNA of a snake, the portion of Venjix was reborn in the new form of Evox and became the primary antagonist of the Beast Morpher Rangers. In the penultimate episode of Beast Morphers, Evox would reveal his real identity as Venjix to Grid Battle Force as he freed and recombined with the rest of his un-tampered base code from the morpher to become his true self again and remove his dependency on Morph-X; a side effect of the experiment that transformed him into Evox. To regain his connection to manipulate the Morphin Grid, as he had done during RPM as Venjix, Evox attempts to take control over all of the Morph-X Towers in the final episode of Beast Morphers. Before he could succeed however the Beast Morpher Rangers and Grid Battle Force manage to flood the base code of the Venjix computer virus with large amounts of human DNA permanently corrupting it and finally destroying Venjix/Evox for good. Venjix is voiced by Andrew Laing. =Venjix's Generals= The following are Venjix's generals who assist him in his goals: General Shifter A Generation-5 robot and one of Venjix's mechanical generals, General Shifter is more serious and aggressive than his counterpart, Crunch; though he can be just as stupid like the time he believed his own reflection was a secondary head inside a monster, but the incidents vary a bit. Venjix gunned him down in a display of annoyance over the constant failures, though he was later rebuilt. Although he does not get involved on the battlefield very often, he is quite a formidable fighter. However, when he designed the Generation-16 Hyperbot to act as a new body for Venjix, Tenaya 7 had tampered with it causing it to malfunction. Because of this, Venjix exiles Shifter into the wasteland. After this, he decides to go rogue and fight the Rangers on his own using special keys to enhance his Hyperbot. When it was destroyed, he took the key and used it on himself. Also during his fight with Ranger Red, he had shot a key into Ranger Red's body which was clearly affecting him during the battle in the Ultrazord. Shifter later used the key to control Scott briefly. After this plot was foiled Shifter grew to Megazord size and battled the Rangers. He was defeated and damaged by the RPM Ultrazord, but managed to survive. Before he could escape though, he was confronted by Scott. The two had a brief battle before Shifter was finally destroyed. Despite his destruction, the physical remains of his body were still relatively intact due to the metallic alloys that comprised it. Shifter's remains were later collected by some Grinders due to these alloys and they were recycled to become part of Venjix's ultimate body. General Shifter is voiced by Mark Mitchinson. General Crunch Another of Venjix's mechanical generals, General Crunch is less serious than his counterpart, Shifter. He is also quite dim-witted, as he has been seen goofing off at their base and on duty as well as suggesting stupid ideas. Despite his lack of intellect, he is still sinister and capable in a battle with the RPM Rangers. As with Shifter, he was shot down by Venjix, several times, the last shots being for naïvely noting some basic flaws in Venjix's plans (poking fun at Power Rangers' genre conventions), such as asking why he waits until his robots are defeated before growing them into giants. He was rebuilt soon after though. Like Shifter, he too is a formidable opponent. When Tenaya hacks into Venjix's database, Crunch breaks into the control tower and begins to fight with Tenaya, easily overpowering her. However, when Doctor K reverses the deletion of Gem and Gemma, they shoot down the control tower with Crunch still inside. Crunch is destroyed offscreen when it crashes into the ground. General Crunch is voiced by Charlie McDermott. Kilobyte Venjix's most feared general, Kilobyte was thought by Venjix to have been destroyed some time ago. He survived however and was wandering the wasteland on foot for over 4,000 miles to return to Venjix. He is a cold, cool-headed chauvinistic warrior who wields a rifle-like blaster, Plasma Bazooka, and a sword in combat. In his first appearance, he showed an extremely demeaning attitude towards Tenaya 7, going as far as flat out attacking her. Both Kilobyte and Venjix know the true origins of Tenaya 7. Kilobyte was one of the ones responsible for helping recapture Dillon & Tenaya when they first tried to escape the palace years ago. After Tenaya learned of her human past and betrayed Venjix, it was Kilobyte who managed to capture her once more and reprogram her into Tenaya 15. He personally challenged the rangers while his army initiated the plan to set explosive charges around Corinth to destroy it. Though defeated by the RPM Ultrazord, he survived, but his inability disappoints Venjix. He creates a radio signal device that will activate any sleeper hybrids within the radio wave. He tests the device out on Hicks but is soon reprimanded by Venjix. Venjix orders Tenaya 15 to destroy Kilobyte after they take over Corinth saying he is glitched, but Kilobyte overhears this. As Venjix begins his final attack on Corinth, Kilobyte sneaks into Corinth's defense control tower and sets Tenaya's weapons to be deleted. He then arrives to battle Tenaya. Her weapons gone, she summons Grinders to defend herself though Kilobyte destroys them. As he prepares to destroy Tenaya, Dillon appears and battles Kilobyte. Kilobyte holds him off, and just as he is ready for the final strike Rangers Red, Blue, and Yellow arrive and destroy him with the Road Blaster. Kilobyte is voiced by Leighton Cardno. =Tenaya= A Generation-7 cyborg created by Venjix on the assumption of being a gynoid, Tenaya 7 is known for whistling the tune from A-Hunting We Will Go (also the tune to The Farmer in the Dell) before confronting and attacking her opponents. First sent to attend Ziggy's Ranger Green audition to bond with and steal the Series Green powers, Ziggy ended up bonding with the powers in an attempt to protect them. Though she failed, Venjix decides to keep Tenaya active due to her attributes. Though believed to be a machine with a human appearance, Tenaya was actually a human who happened to be Dillon's biological sister, referred to only as \\"Subject G-78\\" at the time. Prior to her conversion and memory wipe, Tenaya was blind until the transformation provided her robotic eyes to see and had parts of her body re-constructed by Venjix robotics, among them her right leg and a detachable hand that she used for infiltration, espionage, and melee sneak attacks. She also used a mechanical visor to protect her face while in battle. Tenaya is depicted as rebellious and patronizing, often criticizing Venjix's plans, talking to it sarcastically, and even attempting to take over after Venjix's supposed demise, but in spite of this, Venjix considers her its most wise and trusted warrior. Though her behavior patterns were much like normal humans, setting her apart from Venjix's creations, Tenaya had a condescending attitude towards humans and took offense to being compared to one. But when Tenaya learned of her origins, she became an ally of the Rangers, helping them to sabotage Venjix and its monsters. Tenaya was subsequently captured by Kilobyte after the battle and reprogrammed into Tenaya 15, a Generation-15 attack bot with no inclination towards or any recollection of being human. This is highly reminiscent of the design by which Karone was brainwashed by way of cybernetic implants to become a colder, more heartless variation of her Astronema alter ego during the events of Power Rangers in Space. Tenaya later makes a deal with Fresno Bob, agreeing to surrender Ziggy in exchange for an unidentified item. While Fresno Bob believes her she double crosses him and gets saved by Ziggy. Later he comes back and that thanks to Tenaya they seem to be even. She is later seen activating the dormant Venjix hybrids and removing all the electricity in the city. Tenaya was eventually ambushed by Kilobyte, who attempted to delete her. She is saved by Ziggy, Dr. K and Dillon, the latter of whom inoculated her with an antidote synthesized by Dr. K, releasing her from Venjix's control. When Dillon's robotics freeze up, she goes to the control tower to upload a virus into Venjix. She is interrupted by General Crunch, who then engages her in battle as the tower is shot down. Dillon wakes up in time to save her from the falling tower and they both parachute out. After the war, Dr. K reports that the robotics allowing her to see might stop working, but she finds that she is okay with this. When Dr. K gives Dillon and Tenaya's pocketwatch back, they insist that she keep it. She goes out into the world with Dillon and Summer and discover that the world has begun to rebuild itself. Tenaya is portrayed by Adelaide Kane. =Grinders= The Grinders are android foot soldiers built when Venjix began its conquest of the world, the Grinders function to support the Venjix Attack Bots as well as pilot the Venjix Drone land/air assault vehicles. Grinders were made by some slaves in a factory. Gem and Gemma were once slaves there as was \\"Subject G-78\\" before becoming Tenaya 7. They are extremely easy to destroy, to the point an unarmed human can singlehandedly destroy scores of them. They make up for this, however, by their seemingly endless numbers. In the Power Rangers Samurai television movie \\"Clash of the Red Rangers,\\" the Grinders accompanied a Venjix general known as Professor Cog to an alternate reality to obtain water from the Sanzu River. The Grinders are shown to transform into motorcycles. Further Grinders would later accompany a rebuilt Cog to this reality again in Power Rangers Super Megaforce only to engage the Warstar Armada's X-Borgs, whom they later teamed up with to battle the Megaforce Rangers before being destroyed. The Grinders made a cameo in flashback in Power Rangers Beast Morphers revolving around Venjix. =Attack Bots= The Attack Bots are highly advanced humanoid combat ready machines designed specifically for infiltrating Corinth to carry out missions and for battling the Rangers. Venjix can remotely initiate a software program to download into the Attack Bot (usually after an Attack Bot is defeated) to make the Attack Bot grow. * Generation 5 Attack Bot - An Attack Bot that resembling an Exhaust system. * Generation 9: Amphibious Attack Bot Water Hoser (voiced by Peter Ford) - A hose-themed Attack Bot that infiltrated Corinth through the city's water supply, through the hydraulic circulatory system. * Subterranean Plutonic Gopher Bot - A Gopher-like Attack Bot designed to tunnel underneath Corinth. * Generation 9: Noz Bot Attack System - An advanced Attack Bot that is based on a spray bottle. * Magnetron - An electromagnet-themed Attack Bot built to disrupt the shields with magnetic fields. * Unnamed Attack Bot #1 - A water bomb/pipe-themed Attack Bot. * Boom Bot - A stereo-themed Attack Bot built mainly as a distraction while Tenaya 7 tried to steal a diamond. * Camera Attack Bot - A camera-themed Attack Bot. He could shoot a blast of energy and take pictures to record data. * Unnamed Attack Bot #2 - A boring machine-themed Attack Bot. His job was to dig into one of the two main fault lines that Corinth City sits on. * Reflect Bot Generation 2 - A pair of mirror-themed Attack Bots. * Gat Bot - A Gatling gun- themed Attack Bot. * Broiler Bot - A water heater-themed Attack Bot. * Sat Bot - A satellite-themed Attack Bot created sometime ago by Venjix. He is voiced by Kelson Henderson. * Lightning Bot - An electric generator-themed Attack Bot. He could attack by using blasts of lightning. * Unnamed Attack Bot #3 - An oil-themed Attack Bot. * Dyna Bot (voiced by Simon McKinney) - A dynamite- themed Attack Bot that accompanied General Shifter and Venjix on a mission in the wastelands. * Vacuum Bot - A vacuum cleaner-themed Attack Bot. * Saw Bot Generation 15 - A saw-themed Attack Bot. * Saw Bot Generation 16 - A chainsaw- themed Attack Bot. * Balloon Bot - A balloon-themed Attack Bot. * Generation 3: Textile Bot - A spinning mule-like Attack Bot. She can unleash streams of yarn strings to immobilize enemies. * Unnamed Attack Bot #4 - A manhole-themed Attack Bot. * Knight Bot - A knight-themed Attack Bot. * Hammer Attack Bot - A hammer-themed Attack Bot. * Generation 3: Chemical Bot - A drinking straw- themed Attack Bot. He uses a biochemical that affects only the XY chromosomes causing the men of Corinth to fall asleep. * Unnamed Attack Bot #5 - An odd dowsing rod-themed Attack Bot. * Series 2 Roto Bot - A drill-themed Attack Bot. * Heat Bot - A heater-themed Attack Bot. * Generation 16 Hyper Bot - A Generation 16 clockwork-powered Attack Bot that resembles a Neanderthal. He was created by General Shifter originally to serve as Venjix's new body. * Unnamed Attack Bot #6 - A dumbbell-themed Attack Bot. * Generation 12 Energy Attack Bot - An Attack Bot that can warp the Rangers' bio-field as well as swallowing and redirect energy-based attacks. * Unnamed Attack Bot #7 - A scrap-metal Attack Bot that is composed of parts of nearly all previous Attack Bots. =Other antagonists= Not all of the RPM Rangers' enemies were associated with Venjix. There were also other enemies of the RPM Rangers that acted on their own. Scorpion Cartel The Scorpion Cartel is one of the five criminal organizations that control the Corinth underworld and are unaffiliated with Venjix. Among its members are: * Fresno Bob - The leader of the Scorpion Cartel. Fresno is known as a criminal to both the Rangers and Colonel Truman, but manages to remain free. After being saved by Ziggy, Fresno Bob decides to let Ziggy off the hook and call them even. He once appeared to have given money to Jungle Karma Pizza. He is portrayed by John Sumner. * Benny - A member of the Scorpion Cartel who was a friend of Ziggy. Alphabet Soup Alphabet Soup (assorted members voiced by Jim McLarty and Cassandra Woodhouse) is a government think tank who abducted Doctor K, Gem, and Gemma to work on secret, complex scientific projects, keeping the children at their facility by making them believe they were ill and fatally allergic to sunlight. They had both the Ranger Series technology and the Venjix virus created, and when Venjix broke free, their primary concern was to ensure nobody knew of their involvement with the creation of the virus by ordering the death of Doctor K, which was thwarted when Gem and Gemma knocked out the facility staffers. However, Colonel Mason Truman and his troops found the facility and found out where Venjix came from. Ronin Ronin (portrayed by Gary Young) is an inmate from an unknown cartel who has a personal grudge with Ziggy. The inmates pin him down on a table as Ronin reminded Ziggy of his past problems with his own lack respect for the people he works with that lead to their incarceration. He points to a tray in the middle of two lime gelatin dessert trays has the only remaining strawberry gelatin desert left and Ronin is only one allowed rights to it because the inmates know better than to anger him. Dillon defies him by taking the last remaining strawberry dessert and it leads to a fight between him and Ronin. He is soon knocked out along with the other inmates by Dillon.

In western Canada, management is a provincial matter, with several associations and societies helping to manage wild horses in British Columbia and Alberta. In Nova Scotia, and various locations in the United States, management is under the jurisdiction of various federal agencies. The largest population of free-roaming horses is found in the Western United States. Here, most of them are protected under the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRH&BA;), and their management is primarily undertaken by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), but also by the U. S. Forest Service (USFS) Because free-roaming horses multiply quickly, able to increase their numbers by up to 20% per year, all North American herds are managed in some fashion in an attempt to keep the population size at a level deemed appropriate. In the western United States, implementation of the WFRH&BA; has been controversial. The law requires that \\"appropriate management levels\\" (AML) be set and maintained on public rangelands and that excess horses be removed and offered for adoption. If no adoption demand exists, animals are to be humanely destroyed or sold \\"without limitation\\" which allows the horses to be sent to slaughter. Since continuous Congressional fiscal mandates have prevented euthanizing healthy animals or allowing sales that result in slaughter, and more animals are removed from the range than can be adopted or sold, excess horses are sent to short- and long- term holding facilities, which are at capacity. The population of free-roaming horses has increased significantly since 2005, triple the AML and at the numbers estimated to be on the range in 1930. History While the horse evolved in North America, it became extinct between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago. There are multiple theories for this extinction, ranging from climate change to the arrival of humans. Horses returned to the Americas beginning with Christopher Columbus in 1493. They also arrived on the mainland with Cortés in 1519. These were mostly Iberian horses now described as \\"Spanish type.\\" The horse also became an important part of Native American culture. The horse population expanded rapidly. Additional European settlers brought a variety of horse types to the Americas, and from all sources, some animals eventually escaped human control and became feral. Modern studies have identified a few modern herds, the Sulphur Springs herd, the Cerbat herd, the Pryor Mountains herd, and the Kiger herd as retaining the original phenotype of horses brought to New World by the Spanish. Eastern Seaboard=Sable Island= Sable Island Horses Since 1960, the horses of Sable Island, unlike those in the rest of Canada, were protected under the Sable Island Regulations section of the Canadian Shipping Act. Following the designation of Sable Island as a National Park Reserve in December 2013, the horses are now fully protected by Parks Canada as wildlife under the Canada National Parks Act and the National Parks Wildlife Regulations. Parks Canada considers the Sable Island horses as 'naturalized wildlife’ and, as such, they are being managed as a taxon equal to other species living on the island. =United States= In the U.S., there are free-roaming herds on some of the barrier islands along the East Coast, notably Chincoteague Ponies, Banker horses and Cumberland Island horses. Most of these herds are managed by the National Park Service with assistance from various organizations. Their populations are held stable through use of contraception and removal and adoption. Western Canada=Management history= In terms of the population of free-roaming horses in historic times, and today, it is estimated to be less than 2,000 horses. Herds are found mainly on the Chilcotin Plateau of British Columbia, the Eastern Slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, and in Saskatchewan's Bronson Forest. There are approximately 800-1000 free-roaming horses in British Columbia. In 2014, the Alberta Government provided an official count of 880 for the horses of the Eastern Slopes of the Rockies and there are thought to be less than 100 horses in the Bronson Forest of Saskatchewan. The free- roaming horses of Western Canada have been subjected to repeated attempts to reduce or eradicate the population. As early as 1896 the Government of British Columbia passed the Wild Horse Extermination Act that made it lawful for anyone licensed by the Government to shoot or otherwise destroy an unbranded stallion over the age of twenty months east of the Cascade Mountains. In the 40 years following implementation of the bounty system in B.C. in 1924, it is estimated that about 15,000 horses were killed. In a 1925 roundup in British Columbia, horses were driven into corrals and offered for sale at $5 a head; the thousands that were left over were shot. At the same time the Government offered a bounty of $2.50 for a pair of horse ears and a scalp. In 1943, an export market developed in Europe and the United States and thousands of free- roaming horses were rounded up in Western Canada and shipped for both food consumption and domestic use. In Alberta, some roundups were done as far back as the 1950s, and a horse permit system was in effect from 1962 to 1972 when about 2000 horses were removed over the span of the ten years. In 1994, the entire herd of over 1,200 horses, which at the time was the largest population of free-roaming horses in Canada, was removed from the Suffield military base on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. In 1993, Alberta introduced the Horse Capture Regulation under the Stray Animals Act which regulates the capture of wild horses, with between 25 and 35 horses being captured each year. However, during the 2011-12 capture season a record 216 horses were captured in Alberta. The Horse Capture Regulation expires on June 30, 2017. =Provincial management= In Canada, except for Sable Island, there is no federal protection for free-roaming horses because Environment Canada considers horses to be introduced foreign animals, not native; therefore they do not qualify for protection under the Species at Risk Act. Instead, they are protected and managed through provincial jurisdiction. Feral horses are considered domestic livestock, not wildlife, under Alberta's Stray Animals Act. In British Columbia horses are controlled for range management purposes through the Grazing Act. In Saskatchewan the one remaining free-roaming herd is protected under The Protection of the Wild Ponies of the Bronson Forest Act (Saskatchewan) =Alberta Mountain Horses or \\"Wildies\\" of Alberta= A small herd of \\"Wildies\\" in the foothills of Alberta in winter. Free-roaming horses on the Eastern Slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta are known locally as the Alberta Mountain Horse or \\"Wildie\\" (). On November 1, 2014, the non-profit advocacy group Wild Horses of Alberta Society (WHOAS) entered into a five-year agreement with the Alberta provincial government's Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development (ESRD). This agreement authorized WHOAS to effectively and humanely manage the feral horse population in a 490 km2 portion of the Sundre Equine Zone on the Eastern Slopes. By November 2017 WHOAS had completed the first three years of a selective contraception program using Zona Stat-H, a form of Porcine Zona Pellucida vaccine, or PZP. WHOAS has vaccinated approximately 82 mares by free-range field darting, some of these mares have received booster shots. With one shot a mare is 70-80% less likely to conceive for the 1st year, depending on the time of year in which she is vaccinated. This increases to 90% with the administration of a booster shot. The contraceptive effects wear off with the chance of conception increasing every year post-vaccination. WHOAS also runs a 20-acre horse rescue facility west of the Town of Sundre for those horses that run into trouble and have to be removed from the wild. The rescue facility will also take in orphaned foals to be raised, gentled and adopted out. In early 2018 the Alberta Government agreed to consider proposals from other not-for-profit groups to conduct PZP contraceptive programs in other areas of concern to maintain the population at manageable levels. If successful, these programs will replace Government captures and culls. =Wild ponies of the Bronson Forest, Saskatchewan= The last known herd of free-roaming horses in Saskatchewan inhabit the Bronson Forest in a remote area of northwestern Saskatchewan about 170 km north of Lloydminster near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. In 2005, the wild ponies of the Bronson Forest numbered around 125 animals, but by 2009 many of the animals had been shot by a person or persons unknown and the herd had been reduced to 37 animals. The shootings brought public attention to the plight of the horses and in the fall 2009 legislative session, Tim McMillan, MLA for Lloydminster, Saskatchewan introduced a private members bill in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. Bill No. 606 received royal assent on December 3, 2009 and The Protection of the Wild Ponies of the Bronson Forest Act (Saskatchewan) came into immediate effect. The Act makes it an offense to \\"in any way willfully molest, interfere with, hurt, capture or kill any of the wild horses of the Bronson Forest\\". It was hoped that the passing of the Act would protect the wild ponies of the Bronson Forest so that they would continue to provide both a living and historical tourist attraction as well as highlight the Bronson Forest for the future and also recognizes the value and unique nature of the wild ponies of the Bronson Forest. Western United States=Introduced vs. Reintroduced Species= In making the determination to protect and manage free-roaming horses on some western Federal lands in 1971 Congress declared them to be \\"living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West (that) contribute to the diversity of life forms within the Nation\\" However, their ecological status in the western landscape is under considerable debate. Some free-roaming horses advocates believe \\"they have a place on the Western landscape as a reintroduced native species.\\" They argue that the horses have reinhabited an ecological niche vacated when they went extinct in North America 10,000 years ago, claiming that the 10,000 year gap is irrelevant. However, the National Academy of Science refutes that claim, stating that because of the large changes that have taken place in the North American environment in the past 10,000 years: \\"It cannot be argued that ecological voids dating back 10 millennia exist and that introduced forms are restoring some kind of earlier integrity.\\" Researchers Jay F. Kirkpatrick and Patricia M. Fazio have publicly advanced the argument that free-roaming horses should be legally classified as \\"wild\\" rather than \\"feral\\" asserting that, due to the presence of Equus ferus on the North American continent until the end of the Pleistocene era, horses were once a native species and that \\"the two key elements for defining an animal as a native species are where it originated and whether or not it coevolved with its habitat.\\" Their position is that E. caballus did both in North America and thus \\"should enjoy protection as a form of native wildlife.\\" In contrast, Bob Garrot, director of the Fish and Wildlife Ecology and Management Program at Montana State University takes the opposite position, explaining, \\"(A)re they native? Are they the same critters that were there 10,000 years ago? Well, no they aren’t. Those horses are not the same horses that were here in the Pleistocene. The Western landscapes are not the same landscapes, neither are the plant and animal communities.\\" The Wildlife Society takes the position that free-roaming horses are an invasive species: \\"Since native North American horses went extinct, the western United States has become more arid and many of the horses’ natural predators, such as the American lion and saber-toothed cat, have also gone extinct, notably changing the ecosystem and ecological roles horses and burros play.\\"http://wildlife.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/Feral.Horses.July_.2011.pdf According to the National Research Council, most free-roaming horse herds are outside of mountain lion and wolf habitat, the two modern species discussed as predators that could potentially control population growth. However a study conducted in 1987-1997 and published in 2001 that is cited in the National Research Council report, indicated that mountain lions could influence the population growth of herds found in mountain lion habitat, but only if there is also a large enough deer population, the lion's natural food source, to maintain a dense lion population. =Management history= Because free-roaming horse populations are not self-limiting, first non-government then government entities have taken on the task of managing their numbers. In 1930, there was an estimated population of between 50,000-150,000 feral horses in the western United States. They were almost completely confined to the remaining General Land Office (GLO) administered public lands and National Forest rangelands in the 11 contingent Western States. Some horses in Nevada originated from escaped Comstock Lode miners, other horses across the west escaped from various settlers or ranch horses that had been turned out to forage when not in use. Some were bred up for use as cavalry horses. A few populations retained centuries-old Spanish horse genetics. Most were managed as \\"mavericks\\" or \\"unbranded stock\\" under estray laws of the various states, and efforts to control their population were left to \\"mustangers\\" and local ranchers. Population control was hampered due to the difficulty of discerning which horses were truly feral and which were owned by ranchers, and in the process, sometimes branded horses were shot. After decades of unregulated cattle, sheep and horse grazing, the range was overgrazed and deteriorating, which led to the passage of the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act. Its purpose was to \\"stop injury to the public lands by preventing over-grazing and soil deterioration; to provide for orderly use, improvement and development; to stabilize the livestock industry dependent upon the Public Range.\\" The U.S. Grazing Service was established to administer the Act. The Grazing Service began establishing grazing fees and determined that the fee for grazing horses would be double that for cattle and sheep. As a result, ranchers, many of whom had gone broke during the Great Depression, frequently ignored the Act and simply released their unpermitted horses on the range. The Grazing Service and the US Forest Service began to pay contractors to assist in rounding up the free-roaming horses. Ranchers were given notice that a roundup would occur in a particular area and to remove their unpermitted horses. They would do so, but after the agencies had swept through and rounded up the horses still estray, the ranchers would return their horses to the range. As a result, most ranges were simply closed to horse grazing altogether. Any horses rounded up were either considered estrays or, if branded, in trespass. A rancher could reclaim his horses if he paid the back fees and fines, but in practice, many were relinquished. The contractors were allowed to take possession of the horses they captured, to dispose of as they saw fit. Tens of thousands of horses were removed from the range between 1934 and 1940. With the outbreak of World War II (WWII), the government efforts to remove the horses stopped. Velma Johnston, \\"Wild Horse Annie'' In 1946, the Grazing Service and the GLO were combined to create the Bureau of Land Management. In the same time period, a surplus of airplanes after WWII made aircraft widely available. The BLM would issue permits for airplane use, and mustangers used them and other motorized vehicles to capture the free roaming horses. In the 1950s, Velma B. Johnston, who became known as \\"Wild Horse Annie\\", led the push for federal protection of the horses and burros. By 1958, there were 14,810 to 29,620 free-roaming horses remaining in the 11 western states. A year later, the first federal feral horse protection law was passed. This statute, popularly known as the \\"Wild Horse Annie Act\\", prohibited the use of aircraft or motor vehicles for hunting \\"wild, unbranded\\" horses or polluting water sources. Passage of the Wild Horse Annie Act did not alleviate the concerns of advocates for free- roaming horses, who continued to lobby for federal rather than state control over these horses. At the same time, ownership of the free-roaming herds was contentious, and ranchers continued to use airplanes to gather them. Federal agencies also continued to try to eliminate horses from areas where they were perceived to be causing resource damage. In 1962, public pressure lead to the establishment of the Nevada Wild Horse Range, and in 1968, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range was established. In 1969, the National Mustang Association, headquartered in Utah, persuaded Senator Frank Moss to introduce a bill (S. 2166) to protect the remaining mustangs of Spanish descent under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966. However, since the bill also called for the removal from public lands of all non-Spanish horses, it came under heavy opposition. Federal protection for all free-roaming horses was ultimately accomplished by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971(WFRHBA). The bill specifically stated: \\"A person claiming ownership of a horse or burro on the public lands shall be entitled to recover it only if recovery is permissible under the branding and estray laws of the State in which the animal is found.\\" This eventually alleviated the problem of horses being rounded up under the auspices of belonging to local ranchers, but right after the law passed, many ranchers claimed all the horses on their allotments, and set about rounding them up. =WFRH&BA; management= The WFRH&BA; called for management of free-roaming horses to be \\"designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands.\\" However, there are few non-anthropogenic means that limit their population growth and keep their numbers in balance. In 1972, the BLM approached Jay F. Kirkpatrick and John W. Turner and requested that they find a contraceptive that could be used to check the population growth of the free- roaming horses. Their efforts ultimately lead to the development of Porcine zona pellucida or PZP, a contraceptive developed from the ovaries of slaughtered pigs.https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi? referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir;=1&article;=1220&context;=thesesdissertations However, the treatment wasn't ready for field trial until 1992.http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context;=sota_2003 so soon after passage of the WFRH&BA;, the agencies began rounding up horses by paying contractors to use saddle horses to chase them into traps for removal. In 1976, the BLM officially established an \\"Adopt-a-Horse\\" program, to place excess horses that had been removed, but had no authority to pass title to the adopters. By 1977, there were 60,000 animals on the range,De Steiguer page 186 the lower end of numbers estimated to be on the range in 1930. In 1976, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLMPA) authorized the agencies to use helicopters to push the horses into traps. Unlike airplanes, helicopters can push horses along at a trot rather than a gallop,Findley, page 8 and the BLM asserts that the helicopter roundups are humane. Using them is still controversial. The American Wild Horse Campaign claims that the helicopter roundups are \\" costly, cruel and inhumane.\\" In 1978, the WFRH&BA; was amended in the Public Rangelands Improvement Act requiring the agencies to set \\"Appropriate Management Levels\\" (AML) and remove excess wild horses. AMLs for each Herd Management Area began to be established through the Land Use Planning Process. The FLPMA required the BLM to manage public lands under the principles of \\"multiple use and sustained yield,\\" thus livestock grazing and wildlife habitat are managed along with free-roaming horses and burros. When the BLM develops land use plans, its official position is that it \\"will consider wild horses and burros in a manner similar to the way it treats other resource values (e.g., cultural, historic, wildlife, and scenic, as distinguished from authorized commercial land uses, such as livestock grazing or timber harvesting).\\" , the current total maximum AML for both horses and burros is 26,715, down from 30,158 in 1986. Advocates for protection of free-ranging horses argued that the AML was set too low, particularly in contrast to the forage allocated for cattle.De Steiguer, pp. 189-190 However, Congress has not suggested that AML be raised, but instead has directed the BLM to look into more effective forms of population control. From 1971 through 2001, the BLM removed 193,000 horses and burros from the federal rangelands, but still could not maintain the populations at AML. The 1978 amendment had provided guidelines for adopting out horses. authorizing passing title to adopters and the BLM managed to place 189,300 of the 193,000 animals in private care. But, in addition to requiring the BLM to set AMLs, the 1978 amendment required that, \\"excess wild free roaming horses and burros for which an adoption demand by qualified individuals does not exist to be destroyed in the most humane and cost efficient manner possible.\\" BLM instead initiated a self-imposed moratorium on destroying excess unadoptable animals in 1982, instead, starting in 1984, placing 20,000 horses with large-scale adopters who took a minimum of 100 horses each. Non-compliance for approving and monitoring those adoptions caused inhumane treatment and death to hundreds of the horses and many adopters sold thousands of them to slaughterhouses after gaining title. BLM terminated the large scale program in 1988 after negative publicity and pressure from the Congress and from 1988 until 2004, Congress prevented the Bureau from destroying excess healthy unadopted animals by stating, in the Department of the Interior's annual appropriations acts, that \\"appropriations herein shall not be available for the destruction of healthy unadopted wild horses and burros in the care of the Bureau of Land Management or its contractors.\\" As an alternative, since 1988, the BLM began sending excess horses to \\"sanctuaries\\". The first sanctuary was the \\"Institute of Range and the American Mustang\\" in the Black Hills, which the BLM paid to maintain 1,650 horses. In 1989, Congress directed the BLM to establish more sanctuaries. Sanctuaries were meant to \\"encourage tourism and economic development in the area as well as public understanding of BLM'S wild horse program\\" but as time went on the concept evolved into \\"long term holding.\\" The long term holding facilities are generally located in the Midwest where conditions are more conducive to the welfare of the horses than the desert ranges, and the life-span of the horses is greatly increased than in the wild. On November 17, 2008, at a public meeting held by the BLM to discuss the fate of horses in long-term holding, Madeleine Pickens announced her plans to buy a one million acre (4,000 km²) tract at an undisclosed location \\"in the West\\" and establish a sanctuary for the horses, which she would adopt and maintain at private expense. However, shortly thereafter she stated that the recession forced many of the donors she hoped would help her pay for the venture backed out, and she requested the BLM pay her a yearly stipend of $500 per horse to maintain the horses. The BLM responded that it was not possible to enter into the contract she requested. However, the BLM did put out invitations for Pickens and others who wished to provide lands to maintain horses for the BLM in \\"Eco_Sanctuaries\\" to submit proposals for evaluation. Pickens did submit a proposal to maintain horses on private and public lands in Nevada, that the BLM agreed to evaluatehttps://www.blm.gov/or/news/files/PublicPrivateLandEcosancPressRel_v8.pdf but evaluation of the proposal stalled after scoping found issues that have yet to resolved. However, there are currently two sanctuaries in Wyoming maintaining horses for the BLM on private lands. In 2001, BLM committed to reducing the population to AML by 2005 by increasing the number of animals removed each year. From 2001 until 2008, over 74,000 animals were removed, but with adoption rates having dropped 36% since the 1990s, only 46,400 were adopted out. In 2004, Congress approved an amendment to the WFRH&BA;, called the \\"Burns Amendment\\" or \\"Burns Rider,\\" which repealed the policy of the preceding 22 years by not including the prohibition against euthanizing healthy horses in the 2005 Interior Appropriations Act and allowed excess wild horses to be sold without limitation if not adopted. This resulted in public outcry.de Steiger p. 201 From fiscal year 2006 through 2009—though there was no restriction on selling or euthanizing excess horses—BLM chose not to exercise either option due to \\"concerns over public and Congressional reaction to the large-scale slaughter of thousands of healthy horses.\\" By FY 2010, implementation of the Burns Amendment was further curtailed by the \\"Rahall Rider,\\" which reinserted into Interior Appropriations the prohibition on money being spent to euthanize healthy horses, while also prohibiting funds from being used to sell horses to parties’ intent on sending them to slaughter.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ88/pdf/PLAW-111publ88.pdf#page=5 Though not directly repealing the Burns Amendment, the Rahall Rider has been added to every appropriations bill from FY 2010 through FY 2018.http://appropriations.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bills-114hr-fc-ap- fy2017-ap00-interior.pdf To comply with these annual restrictions, the BLM purchase contract has a statement prohibiting purchasers from processing horses into commercial products. As a result, the BLM now maintains excess horses in long- and short-term holding facilities. More animals are removed from the range than can be adopted or sold. As a result, by June 2008, 30,088 excess animals were held in captivity, up from 9,807 in 2001. That same year, the BLM predicted that the \\"number of wild horses on the range would reach about 50,000, or about 80 percent over AML, by 2012.\\" In February 2007, BLM estimated it was 1,000 animals over AML, the closest it had ever been, but researchers had found that BLM's census methods \\"consistently undercounted\\" them. After 2008, adoption numbers began to drop. By 2014, just over 2000 animals a year were being adopted. The BLM continued removing large numbers of horses, but by 2013, had no more space in long-term or short term holding facilities for the excess, and removal rates dropped from 8,255 in 2012 to 1,857 in 2014. In a 2014 report by the House Appropriations Committee it was stated \\"The horse and burro management program in its current state is unsustainable and the Committee cannot afford to perpetuate the situation for much longer.\\" In both the 2015 and 2016 budgets the Rahall language to prevent euthanizing and selling without limitation excess horses and to continue to allow funds to be used for long term holding. However, the amount allocated did not allow the BLM conduct sufficient gathers to achieve the Senate's directive, and on September 9, 2016, the BLM Wild Horse Resource Advisory Board (RAC) recommended the BLM be allowed to start euthanizing or selling without limitation horses to \\"alleviate space in the holding facilities to save the BLM more money in which they could use for gathers and start relieving some of these impacted rangelands.\\" In response to the RAC recommendation, the Humane Society of the United States(HSUS) refuted the idea that the BLM should remove horses to achieve AML and instead implement fertility control.http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2016/09/blm- recommendation-090916.html In January 2017, Freedom Caucus member Representative Morgan Griffith from Virginia wanted to implement the Holman Rule, that would slash individual pay of government workers to $1, citing the $80 million cost of administering the free-roaming horse program as one among many examples of misspent government resources. Instead of implementing the RAC recommendation the Rahall language was again included in the budget bill which finally passed on May 5, 2017 to manage spending until the end of the FY2017, but the increased Congressional attention on the costs of the program,https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/244/text The explanatory statement accompanying the budget reflected increased Congressional attention on the costs of the program, and required the BLM to prepare and submit: \\"a plan to achieve long-term sustainable populations on the range in a humane manner\\" giving the agency 180 days, until early November, to submit the plan (hereafter referred to as the \\"report\\"). On May 23, 2017, President Donald Trump released the FY2018 Interior Budget in Brief which, while reducing the free-roaming horse budget by ten million dollars, \\"proposes to give BLM the tools it needs to manage this program in a more cost-effective manner, including the ability to conduct sales without limitation. The budget proposed to eliminate appropriations language restricting BLM from using all of the management options authorized in the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act. The remainder of the funding decrease would be achieved by reducing gathers, reducing birth control treatments, and other activities deemed inconsistent with prudent management of the program.\\"https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/2018_highlights_book.pdf Despite Senate prodding on November 20, 2017, stating: \\"The Committee looks forward to the release of the report...and is hopeful that it will contain a range of humane and politically viable options that can collectively be implemented to drastically reduce on-range populations and a variety of methods to limit unsustainable on-range reproduction\\", the BLM failed to submit the report, so Congress declined to remove the Rahall language from the 2018 budget, stating: \\"Until the Department provides a comprehensive plan and any corresponding legislative proposals to the appropriate authorizing committees, the Committees will maintain the existing prohibitions and reduce the resources available for the program\\" and gave the BLM until April 22, 2018 to submit the report. On April 26, 2017, the BLM submitted the report as required,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2018/04/27/feds-calling-for- massive-roundups-of-wild-horses-on-public-lands-says-report-quietly-slipped- to-congress/ providing several options for Congress to consider, including fertility control as recommended by the HSUS, mostly consisting of the sterilization.https://www.eenews.net/assets/2018/04/26/document_pm_02.pdf In the meantime, the Department of Interior budget request for fiscal year 2019 had again requested that the restrictions of the Rahall amendment not be included in the 2019 budgethttps://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/fy2019_blm_budget_justification.pdf The report stated that at the end of 2017, there was an estimated 83,000 wild horses and burros, or three times AML, on public lands. Congress has yet to act on the information. Horses of Placitas Horses captured under the authority of the WFRH%BA are freeze branded on the left side of the neck by the BLM, using the International Alpha Angle System, a system of angles and alpha- symbols that cannot be altered. The brands begin with a symbol indicating the registering organization, in this case the U.S. Government, then two stacked figures indicating the individual horse's date of birth, then the individual registration number. Mustangs kept in sanctuaries are also marked on the left hip with four inch-high Arabic numerals that are also the last four digits of the freeze brand on the neck. Other Western US herds Since the WFRH&BA; applies only to unclaimed horses that were free roaming on lands managed by the BLM and USFS at the time of passage of the Act, there are a number of other free-roaming horse herds in the west, including: *Placitas Herd (New Mexico) *Virginia Range Herd (Nevada) *Sheldon Herd (Nevada) *Theodore Roosevelt National Park Herd (North Dakota) *Salt River Herd (Arizona) *Herds on Indian Reservations such as those on the Pyramid Lake Paiute, the Uintah and Ouray Ute and the Ute Mountain Ute Reservations. However, horses from the Ute Mountain Reservation are migrating into the Mesa Verde National Park causing a management dilemma for the Park. Herds of free roaming horses on the Navajo Reservation have multiplied to the point that the tribe is considering multiple options, including roundups, adoption, sterilization, sales, and even hunting. =Horses vs. Wildlife and Livestock on Public Lands= Much of the debate as to whether free-roaming horses are an Introduced vs. Reintroduced species is in the context of the priority of use of the resources of public lands the horses should have in relation to wildlife and livestock. The need for more sustainable management is generally agreed upon because of the degradation of the western range in areas inhabited by free-roaming horses, but what and how management occurs is hotly debated. Advocates for free-roaming horses suggest reducing the numbers of sheep and cattle permitted to graze on public lands to allocate more resources for horses, ranching interests hold the opposite, wishing to see horse numbers maintained at AML, while wildlife advocates want to prioritize native species over both domestic livestock and free-roaming horses. Cattle and sheep ranchers and others who support the position of the livestock industry tend to favor a lower priority of feral horses than private livestock for use of public land, and argue that the horses degrade the public rangelands. The numbers of cows that can graze the range decreases as the number of horses increases.http://www.rangemagazine.com/features/winter-16/range-wi16-ignoring- law.pdf However the debate as to how much horses compete with cows for forage is multifaceted. Ruminates such as cattle and sheep, with their multi- chambered stomachs, can extract more energy from their feed, and thus require less, but more high quality forage, such as leaves and forbs. Horses are evolutionarily adapted to survive in an ecological niche dominated by \\"fibrous herbage\\" (i.e. low quality grass forage) due to being \\"hindgut fermenters\\", meaning that they digest nutrients by means of the cecum. Thus, horses are adapted to inhabit an ecological niche characterized by poor quality vegetation.Budiansky, p. 31 While this means that they extract less energy from a given amount of forage, it also means that they can digest food faster and make up the difference in efficiency by increasing their consumption rate, obtaining adequate nutrition from lower quality forage than can ruminants. Because of their consumption rate, while the BLM rates horses by animal unit (AUM) to eat the same amount of forage as a cow-calf pair, 1.0, some studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM.National Research Council, Using Science, p. 207 Horses can, however, cover vast distances to find water and the high fibrous grasses they thrive on;Budiansky, p. 186 they may range nine times as far from water sources as cattle, traveling as much as to from a water source.http://www.equusite.com/articles/behavior/behaviorDrMcGreevy.shtml This means they can reach grazing land that cattle cannot access. Unlike cows, horse incisors allow them to graze plants much closer to the ground increasing recovery time for the plant. Modern rangeland management also recommends removing all livestock during the growing season to maximize recovery of the forage. Allowing livestock, including horses, to graze year-round not only degrades the range, but negatively impacts the wildlife that shares the same area. Another concern is that Feral horses compete for water with other wildlife species, and often are dominant over some, such as the pronghorn, which in drought conditions causes stress that impacts the survival.
