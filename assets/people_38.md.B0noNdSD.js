The route started in 2008 as a Dutch regional initiative in the Arnhem-Nijmegen area and then developed into a transnational route that was officially inaugurated in Arromanches on June 6, 2014, during the Normandy D-day commemorations. The route goes from Southern England, (commemorating the early years of the war), through France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands to Berlin, in Germany and then extends to the Czech Republic and Poland. The southern route starts in Italy. As a form of remembrance tourism LRE aims to unfold these Allied offensives of 1944 and 1945 in one narrative combining the different perspectives and points of view. By combining locations with personal stories of people who fought and suffered there, it gives visitors the opportunity to follow the Allied march and visit significant sites from war cemeteries to museums and monuments but also events and commemorations. In April 2019, Liberation Route Europe became a certified Cultural Route of the Council of Europe.  The Route  Heinkel 111s, which were used in the Battle of Britain = Great Britain = After the fall of France in 1940 and their own defeat on the continent, The Royal Air Force (RAF) defended their island. The action became known as the Battle of Britain.

This operation marked the start of the liberation of Western Europe. The route here comprises the five landing beaches: Omaha Beach (from Sainte-Honorine-des- Pertes to Vierville-sur-Mer), Utah Beach (Sainte-Marie-du-Mont), Gold Beach (between Port-en-Bessin and La Rivi√®re), Juno Beach (from Courseulles to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer), Sword Beach (from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer), along with Pointe du Hoc (Criqueville-en-Bessin) and Ranville (British Airlandings) or Longues-sur-Mer (German Battery). The following Battle of Normandy resulted not only in the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers, but also many French civilians. Almost all of the larger cities in the region were badly damaged.

It became a platinum record in Canada. The album was recorded at Mushroom Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia between December 1987 and March 1988, and was published by Epic Records and CBS Records in 1988. The song \\"Something to Live For\\" became a number one hit in Canada, the band's first top-ten single. Two other songs, \\"House of Love (is Haunted)\\" and \\"Come Back to Me\\", also charted in Canada, and the band became a \\"pop radio fixture\\" in Canada. Gary Fraser, a friend of Barney Bentall, wrote all the album's lyrics. He began writing lyrics for Bentall in 1978, when he sent Bentall poems. Bentall and Fraser prepared a demo tape, produced by Bob Rock. The band hired film students to record a music video for \\"Something to Live For\\", which drew the attention of managers at MuchMusic, who broadcast the video frequently. The video was described by media critic Peter Goddard of the Toronto Star as \\"simplicity itself\\". The success of the album resulted in the band receiving the 1989 Juno Award for Most Promising Group of the Year. The band was considered a favourite to win the award against other nominees 54-40, The Jitters, The Northern Pikes, and The Pursuit of Happiness. They were also nominated for Canadian Entertainer of the Year, which was ultimately awarded to Glass Tiger.

Overview  Make Votes Matter is \\"the cross-party campaign to introduce Proportional Representation to the House of Commons, led by democratically- organised activists in a united movement for electoral reform.\\" It was co- founded by Owen Winter, Klina Jordan and other activists. It advocates for the replacement of the first-past-the-post currently used for elections to the House of Commons. Make Votes Matter advocates a proportional representation system (in line with the rest of Europe), campaigning for it based on the principles established in the Make Votes Matter Declaration. These are that a voting system should ensure: * That those who are entitled to vote have a vote that counts, and counts equally ‚Äì no matter who they vote for, or where they live; * That the share of seats a party gets should closely reflect the share of votes the people give them. The pressure group favours replacing the current voting system in the UK (First Past the Post), with a system of proportional representation where each vote individually counts and correlates to seats in parliament. Activities In the weeks following the 2015 United Kingdom general election a number of online petitions calling for electoral reform emerged, coordinated by individuals and organisations such as the Electoral Reform Society and Unlock Democracy. These petitions received over 477,000 signatures and were delivered to 10 Downing Street by a cross-party group of politicians. Through these petitions, a group of activists formed to continue campaigning for proportional representation. In February 2016, Make Votes Matter organised a cross-party summit to discuss how to achieve a reformed voting system attended by politicians including Chuka Umunna and Natalie Bennett. In May 2016, the organisation orchestrated an open letter to Leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn signed by 7 MPs and over 10,000 members of the public, including 2,000 Labour members. Most recently, the campaign has orchestrated national days of action for Proportional Representation such as Hungry for Democracy on 6 February 2018 in which 407 people joined a 24 hour \\"hunger strike\\". Those that took part in the day of action included public figures, MEPs, and MPs such as Stephen Kinnock. Later on in 2018, the campaign organised a nationwide day of action - Demand Democracy Day - on 30 June as a prelude to the inaugural Cabinet Office- organised National Democracy Week. The action day saw volunteers organise events in over 60 towns and cities across the UK from Truro to Aberdeen. Make Votes Matter is supported by an alliance of organisations and individuals that have endorsed the 'Make Votes Matter Declaration'. This includes the Green Party of England and Wales, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Scottish National Party and UKIP as well as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Michael Sheen, Frankie Boyle, the Electoral Reform Society and others.

Sablan served as the second Lieutenant Governor of Guam from 1975 until 1979 under Governor Ricardo Bordallo. Biography =Early life and education= Sablan was born in Agana, Guam, which is now known as Hag√•t√±a. He graduated from Father Due√±as Memorial School in 1950 as the valedictorian of his class. Sablan received his bachelor's degree in political science from the former Loyola University of Los Angeles, which is now part of Loyola Marymount University. He was hired by a Navy Public Works Center after college before enlisting in the United States Army. Sablan, who was based in Hawaii, served as a U.S. Army intelligence analyst and area studies specialist as part of the Army Psychological Warfare Unit. He returned to Guam after an honorable discharge. Career =Civil service= Once he had returned to Guam, Sablan took a job within the territorial government. He was quickly promoted to administrative positions within government agencies, including the Director of Labor and Personnel by 1961. His work caught the attention of Governor Manuel F.L. Guerrero, who appointed Sablan as both assistant Secretary of Guam and executive assistant to the Governor during the 1960s. The appointments allowed Sablan to oversee much of Guam's executive branch. =Political career= In 1974, Governor Carlos Camacho, a Republican and the first elected Governor of Guam, sought re-election for a second term, together with his Lt. Governor Kurt Moylan. Four Democrats declared their intention to challenge Camacho, including Ricardo Bordallo, former Gov. Manuel Flores Leon Guerrero (who teamed with David D.L. Flores as his running mate for Lt. Governor); Pedro C. Sanchez, the former President of University of Guam (who teamed with Esteban U. Torres), and Joaquin C. \\"Kin\\" Arriola (teamed with school principal, Ted S. Nelson). On the Republican side, a rival team, Senator Paul McDonald Calvo with running mate Tony Palomo, challenged Governor Camacho for the GOP nomination. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ricardo Bordallo chose Rudy Sablan as his running mate for Lt. Governor. The Bordallo-Sablan team won the 1974 Democratic primary election, defeating the three other candidates. Governor Carlos Camacho won the Republican nomination, beating the Calvo-Palomo ticket, but badly dividing Guam's Republican Party. The Republican split worked to the Democrat's advantage, allowing Bordallo to defeat Governor Camacho in the November gubernatorial election. Governor Bordallo and Lt. Governor Rudy Sablan were sworn into office on January 6, 1975. Sablan became the second elected Lt. Governor in Guam's history. However, Bordallo and Sablan frequent, public spats and disagreements on policy issues plagued the Bordallo-Sablan administration throughout their four-year term. The political relationship between the Governor and Lt. Governor broke down by the 1978 general election. In 1978, Rudy Sablan ran against Governor Bordallo in the gubernatorial election. Sablan chose Jose L. \\"Joe\\" Leon Guerrero as his running mate for Lt. Governor, while Governor Bordallo replaced Sablan with Dr. Pedro C. Sanchez, a historian and educator, on his ticket. Governor Bordallo defeated Sablan in the 1978 Democratic primary, taking 34.2% while Sablan-Guerrero placed second with 25% of the vote. Ricardo Bordallo ultimately lost his re-election bid to Republican Paul McDonald Calvo in November 1978. Four years later, Sablan once again announced his candidacy for Governor of Guam in the 1982 gubernatorial election. Sablan again picked his Joe Leon Guerrero, as his running mate for Lt. Governor (Sablan and Guerrero had also run on the same ticket in 1978). However, the Sablan-Guerrero lost a rematch in Democratic primary to Ricardo Bordallo and his new running mate, Edward Diego Reyes. Bordallo defeated Sablan by 35 percentage points in the Democratic primary to win the nomination. Bordallo, in a second political rematch from 1978, then beat Governor Paul McDonald Calvo in the November 1982 general election. (Calvo had previously ousted Bordallo from office in 1978). =Later career and life= Governor Ricky Bordallo appointed Sablan as a member of Commission on Self- Determination, which oversaw the future relationship between Guam and the United States, from 1983 until 1987. Sablan remained a proponent the Guam Commonwealth Act, even after the end of the Bordallo-Reyes administration in 1987. In December 1989, Sablan testified in support of the Guam Commonwealth Act at the sole U.S. congressional hearing on the Act, which was held in Honolulu. In 1983, Sablan was appointed Chairman of the board of directors of the Guam Airport Authority, a territorial government agency which operates the island's international airport (now known as Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport). Under Sablan, the airport's terminals and runways were modernized and expanded to encourage a growing tourism industry. Sablan worked to reconcile the various, often infighting, factions of the Democratic Party of Guam by 1993. He endorsed the 1994 gubernatorial campaign of Governor Carl Gutierrez and Lt. Gov. Madeleine Bordallo and has been credited with helping the Gutierrez-Bordallo team win the 1994 general election. Sablan became an integral advisor to the new Gutierrez administration. Governor Carl Gutierrez appointed Sablan to the Commission on Self-Determination from 1994 until his death in 1995. (Sablan had previously served on the Commission from 1983 to 1987 under Governor Ricky Bordallo). In 1994 and 1995, Gutierrez appointed Sablan as part of a team who represented Guam at the Base Reuse and Realignment Commission hearings in San Francisco, California. Sablan died on July 24, 1995 (equivalent to the early morning of July 25, Guam time) at the age of 63. He was survived by his wife, Esperanza \\"Ancha\\" Cruz San Nicolas; their two children, Rudy and Essie; and three grandchildren, Marie Antoinette, Jessica, and Mario.

He was married to the American ichthyologist Marion Durbin Ellis (1887-1972) in 1909. Early life and career Ellis was the son of Horace and Grace V. Ellis. He was born in Lawrence, Indiana and grew up in West Lafayette, Indiana. He graduated from Vincennes University in 1907 where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity and received his PhD in 1909 from Indiana University. In 1908 he was a delegate to Sigma Pi‚Äôs first National Congress. After graduation he became an Assistant Professor of Biology in charge of the Zoological Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder in Boulder, Colorado. In 1909 he was published in The Journal of Experimental Zoology for his experimentation with tadpoles. As aa young man, Ellis also served in the National Guard for four years for Indiana and then Idaho rising to the rank of sergeant. Gimbel Expedition In 1911 he headed the Gimbel exploration into the regions of the headwaters of the Amazon River. Under the joint auspices of Indiana University and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History this expedition made valuable biological discoveries about the gymnotidae eels and fish of the region. These discoveries were chronicled in his paper Gymnotid Eels of Tropical America which was published in 1913. Mid career In 1913, he and Frank Marion Andrews were published in the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club with an article about the leaf hairs of salvinia natans. His first book, The Amphibia and Reptilia of Colorado, which he co-wrote with Junius Henderson was published in 1913. His second book, Fishes of Colorado, was published in 1914. During this time, he and his wife Marion had their first child, Cornelia Grace, who was born in October 1914. He published many articles about plant and animal life in the American West. He had two articles published in the journal Nautilus. The first in 1916 and the second, with M. Keim, in 1918. He was published twice in the Proceedings of the United States National Museum, first in 1912 and again in 1919. He was also published in Transactions of The American Microscopical Society (1913) and Copeia (1917). In 1917 Ellis became a charter member of the Ecological Society of America. In 1921 Ellis was a member of the faculty of the University of Missouri. U.S. Bureau of Fisheries Beginning in 1925 and through the 1940s Ellis worked in association with the Fairport, Iowa lab of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries on the Mississippi River. His work centered on an effort to propagate mussels, which were then used by the button industry, in the river. Finding a way to increase the number of mussels became a near obsession for him. He had a few early successes. In 1925 he found that ultraviolet rays were fatal to glochidia, which was why mussels fared better in the dark. He also found that the acid- alkali balance of the blood the glochida fed on was important. This led to his use of a nutritive solution in 1926 which became known as the Ellis Method. This method was thought to be a way around the parasitic stage of mussel life and was published in Science magazine that year. However, this process did not transfer well from the laboratory to the field. In the fall of 1927 he took a sabbatical and visited European labs in an attempt to gain further insight. He visited the University of Glasgow where he worked under Dr. D. Noel Paton and with protein chemist Dr. E.P. Cathcart. He also visited the Marine Laboratory on the island of Great Cumbrae, Firth of Clyde where he was able to use the Coates Research Room and Table. With the help of Dr. Paton‚Äôs introductions he also visited several medical labs in England and travelled to the Netherlands, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Switzerland, and Belgium. On his return to the U.S. in 1928 he designed several apparatus to culture mussels. Ellis‚Äô, and other scientists‚Äô, work on the problem lead them to see the problems in broader terms than just the mussel population. Beginning in 1930, they began to study the river as a whole and Ellis was able to prove mussels were sensitive to water quality. His eleven-person team, working out of the University of Missouri School of Medicine in Coumbia, would later develop techniques for water chemistry analysis for river water. They also found that it was better to transport mussels in damp material rather than in ice. In 1932 Ellis was chosen to supervise the Investigations in Interior Waters which combined the mussel propagation study with pollution studies. The study looked at 800 miles of the Mississippi river, streams in 21 states, and mining pollution in Idaho, North Dakota, and Montana. In 1937 he published an article on assay techniques. The pollution study continued until 1940 but Ellis continued to write about the subject with (what in 1940 became) the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service until 1947. In 1932 the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries Fort Worth, TX station began experiments on mussels. He moved his study of mussels there because of the suitable water and relatively warm winters. He continued to refine his method and to study the effect of pollution on mussels needed for the button industry. A portion of his work had been funded by the industry. The program stayed there until the US Fish and Wildlife Service cut funding for it in 1942 Reasons for the cut include the beginning of World War II, Ellis‚Äôs refusal to make a demonstration, and the belief that the button industry was fading away. He was also secretive and did not apply for a copyright for his method because he would have to write it down. Ellis died in Los Angeles, California in 1953. He is described as a careful scientist with a respectable career and reputation. It is doubtful that he would tarnish it with false claims. Lab work since that time has confirmed that some species can skip their parasitic stage. In 1982 Billy G. Isom and Robert G. Hudson published information on a solution they used to attain the same results as Ellis‚Äô group in the 1930s. Lost work In the late 1990s, historian Philip Scarpino had arranged with the University of Missouri to inspect Ellis‚Äôs equipment and papers which had been stored in the attic of a science building. Unfortunately, when he arrived he found that everything had been discarded. Anyone finding more of his records, pertinent to the history of mussels and the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, should contact the D.C. Booth Historic National Fish Hatchery in Spearfish, South Dakota so that the records may be preserved. Patronymi The Knifefish Parapteronotus ellisi is named after Ellis.

It is based on the 1990s television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. Gameplay The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles features side- scrolling platform gameplay with the player controlling Indiana Jones. Weapons include dynamite, daggers, grenades, and guns, as well as Indiana's whip. The player begins only with the whip, which is replaced by the next weapon the player picks up. Weapons, as well as gold and other items, are picked up by destroying boxes. Weapons and items serve as Indiana's health: each time he is hit by an enemy, he loses a possession. If Indiana has no more possessions, he must use his fists to defend himself, and will die if hit again. The game features eight levels played across three locations: Mexico (two levels), France (two levels), and Germany (four levels). The game's early levels are based on episodes of the television series, while later levels feature an original storyline. As Indiana, the player begins by fighting in the Mexican Civil War, and subsequently fights in Europe during World War I. Each level features a boss enemy that must be defeated. Plot Young Indiana Jones arrives in Mexico on vacation, during the country's civil war. Indiana releases peasants captured by General Pancho Villa and his bandits, who are attempting to seize control. After defeating Villa in a battle, Indiana is informed of a person known as the Claw, who has stolen an Egyptian artifact known as the Jackal. Indiana follows the Claw through an abandoned silver mine. From atop a mining scaffold, the Claw uses exploding dynamite sticks to battle Indiana, who uses the falling rocks to defeat the Claw. Indiana then takes a boat to Europe and enlists to fight in World War I. Indiana traverses a dangerous battlefield, fights a large tank, and subsequently learns of a long-range artillery gun codenamed Big Bertha. Indiana scales a high mountainside to locate and destroy Big Bertha in a battle. Indiana is promoted to the rank of Captain and is sent to Germany to stop the German commander, who plans to use poison gas to kill the Allied forces and enslave Europeans. Indiana boards an enemy train and travels across the railway cars, before ultimately battling the engineer at the front of the train. A fighter pilot ally swoops his plane down to pick up Indiana from the train. Indiana shoots down a group of enemy fighter pilots and then battles the Red Baron in his Fokker triplane. Indiana reaches the German High Command, a fortress full of enemies and various security measures. There, Indiana battles the German commander and his battle tank, knocking out the commander and using his grenades to destroy the tank. Indiana reaches the weapons facility and must avoid poison liquid, as well as evil scientists and guards. Indiana reaches the poison gas lab, places a bomb there, and escapes the facility before it explodes. Reception Nintendo Power praised the game's \\"variety of action\\", but wrote, \\"The graphics are mediocre and the character control can be awkward at times. The game doesn't do justice to the show.\\" Christoper Michael Baker of AllGame rated the game two and a half stars out of five and was critical of the difficult gameplay. Baker wrote, \\"Unfortunately, the game's quality falls well short of the series'. [...] Once you get to a rough spot, any enjoyment you may get from the game will eventually result in frustration.\\" Baker praised the graphics and cutscenes, but called the sound and music, \\"Pretty basic\\".

It is owned and managed by Rochford District Council. Hockley Woods are the largest residual area of the wild wood, which covered much of Essex after the Ice Age, 10,000 years ago. Hockley Woods comprise several contiguous named woods including: Great Bull Wood, Great Hawkwell Wood, Beeches Wood, Winks Wood, Little Bull Wood, Whitbred's Wood and Parson's Snipe. Hockley woods extend over parts of the parishes of Hockley, Hawkwell and Rayleigh. The size of Hockley Woods is variously given as 130 hectares, 109 hectares and 91.3 hectares, although the latter is the SSSI only. The woods are on pre-glacial gravels and clay. The wooded areas are an intricate mosaic of various trees, every species developing under appropriate conditions. Oak and sweet chestnut develop on the higher ground; birch on the most acidic soils; hornbeam on the wet soils; willow, and hazel along the streams. Other trees include pedunculate oak, sessile oak and birch. Ground flora include three species of orchid, and there is a stream and area of bog. Other species include the wild service tree, wood anemone, wood spurge and cow wheat that develop on the undisturbed soils of old woods.The protected heath fritillary butterfly is common on the site. Hockley Woods continue to be coppiced and used for timber. It is also the location for Hockley Woods parkrun, a free, weekly, timed 5km running event held every Saturday at 9am. Access to the wooded areas is unrestricted; there is a bus stop on Main Road (SS5 4RN), and also a car park, the site has public toilets. The car park is open from 7am until 6.30pm. A brochure is available from the Council Offices. The woods are said to be haunted by two ghosts. Silas was said to be friendly, while the other entity was accompanied by a feeling of cold which upset the family dog. This ghost is said to have been so friendly that the family dog would run up to the sounds wagging its tail. Another tale states that the ghost of Anne Boleyn has been seen without her head walking the corridors of the house.  Other woods in Hockley  Other isolated woods within the parish of Hockley are as follows. Betts Wood (Ordnance Survey Reference TQ834929), 2.17 hectares, is a rectangular wood principally comprising coppiced Hornbeam and standard Oak with Ash, Hazel and Elm. Ground vegetation consists mainly of brambles. The wood is a public open space bordered by housing, a school and a community centre car park. To the west an abandoned field is now a Hornbeam and Oak wood. Blounts Wood (TQ818929), 3.21 hectares, is a rectangular wood principally comprising Hornbeam, Ash and Hazel. It has a rich flora including Wild Service, Crab Apple, and Hart‚Äôs Tongue Fern. The Shenfield to Southend Railway forms the southern boundary of the wood. Crabtree Wood (TQ833935), 1.55 hectares, a Hornbeam wood around a small steep valley. A large wood bank marks the boundary with Hockley Hall Wood. The flora is quite poor, although bluebells are abundant. Folly Wood (TQ832926), 1.44 hectares, is a rectangular wood of pure Hornbeam and is densely shaded and brambles are abundant. It has a few Oaks. Its boundaries comprise housing and an arable field. Hockley Hall Wood (TQ831935),12.59 hectares and the detached Hockley Hall Wood South (TQ830930), 0.3 hectares. Hockley Hall Wood is a scarp wood mainly comprising Hornbeam, with some Ash and Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). It has a rich flora and is much shaded and with an acid soil, the grass Milium effusum is in profusion. Hockley Hall Wood is privately owned although a public footpath runs through the wood in an East-West direction. Hockley Hall Wood South became detached from Hockley Hall Wood with the construction of the Shenfield to Southend railway in 1888. It has the typical structure of an Oak-Hornbeam wood. It has a rich flora including Wild Service, broom, brambles and bluebells. The railway forms the northern boundary and an arable field the other boundaries. Marylands Wood (TQ837930), 4.79 hectares, is a rectangular Hornbeam wood, with Ash, Maple, Willow and Hawthorn. It has abundant flora including Wild Service, bluebell, and three species of orchid. The railway forms the southern boundary, and housing the eastern boundary. Marylands Wood is distinct from Marylands Nature Reserve (TQ839933). Plumberow Wood (TQ839940), 5.22 hectares, is a privately owned scarp wood with less Hornbeam than neighbouring woods. Timber trees are mainly Ash, the flora is rather poor, but bluebells are abundant.

The FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015 categorized it as a general aviation facility.National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015: Appendix A (PDF, 2.03 MB). Federal Aviation Administration. Updated 4 October 2010. It is also the location of Hulman Field Air National Guard Base of the Indiana Air National Guard. History Originally called Hulman Field, the airport dates to 1943 when ground was broken on a site donated to the city of Terre Haute by businessman Anton \\"Tony\\" Hulman, Jr. The airport was dedicated on October 3, 1944, and had three runways, taxiways, apron area, and a terminal building. In 1953, a new terminal and control tower were completed and the apron expanded. Since 1954, the 181st Intelligence Wing of the Indiana Air National Guard has been stationed at the airport. In 1976 the city of Terre Haute and Vigo County jointly formed an authority to manage the airport. The Terre Haute Regional Airport Authority has six board members, with three members appointed by the mayor of Terre Haute and three members appointed by the Vigo County commissioners. The terminal was expanded in 1977 and 1981. In 1998 the name was changed from Hulman Regional Airport to Terre Haute International Airport - Hulman Field, primarily due to U.S. Postal Service contractor Evergreen Airlines using the airport as a hub which has since closed. Hulman Field used to host the Terre Haute Air Fair. Performers included the USAF Thunderbirds, the Red Baron Pizza Squadron, and Michael Hunter, the world's only insulin-dependent aerobatics pilot. The Air Fair was run almost entirely by volunteers including some from community organizations and school organizations looking for fundraising opportunities. In 2016, the airport received a $3.5 million federal grant to fund repairs to a runway.\\"Terre Haute International Airport gets $3.5 million grant for runway work\\".

The ANG enclave is called Hulman Field Air National Guard Base. The 181 IW is operationally gained by the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA). The unit served in World War II, flying anti-submarine patrol along the East Coast of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico. It was also activated for the Korean War and the Berlin Crisis of 1961. In 1962 it was established as a fighter unit, the 181st Tactical Fighter Group (181 TFG), operationally-gained by the Tactical Air Command (TAC). Initially using the RF-84F Thunderstreak, the unit transitioned to the F-84F Thunderstreak in 1964, the F-100D/F Super Sabre in 1971, the F-4 Phantom II in 1979, and the F-16 Fighting Falcon in 1991. Known as the Racers, the then-181 TFG participated in the first Gulf War from 1990 to 1991. With the disestablishment of TAC in 1992, the unit was redesignated the 181st Fighter Group (181 FG) and operationally-gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC). In 1995, it was redesignated as the 181st Fighter Wing (181 FW) and deployed to Kuwait on two separate occasions in support of Operation Southern Watch. On September 11, 2001, the 181 FW flew combat air patrols over the Midwestern United States less than four hours after the attacks on New York City and Washington, DC. The wing drastically increased its operations tempo, deployed members and equipment to 19 countries, and simultaneously supported seven different military operations, including Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch, Operation Joint Forge, Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Deep Freeze, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2005, concurrent with an Air Force initiative to phase out F-16C/D aircraft Block 30 and older, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) mandated the end of flying operations for the 181 FW. On September 8, 2007, the wing's F-16C Block 30s flew their last training mission out of Terre Haute Regional Airport/Hulman Field Air National Guard Base. The wing's squadrons were redesignated as a Distributive Ground Station (DGS) and an Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS) and on May 3, 2008, the 181st Fighter Wing was re-designated as the 181st Intelligence Wing (181 IW).  Facilities  The airport covers and has two runways: * Runway 5/23: Asphalt * Runway 14/32: Asphalt/Concrete Indiana State University uses Hulman Field for its aviation program. The USAF uses Hulman Field for worldwide command and control of remote control surveillance aircraft.

B. Shemran), from a screenplay by Safinia and Todd Komarnicki based on the 1998 book The Surgeon of Crowthorne (published in the United States as The Professor and the Madman) by Simon Winchester. It stars Mel Gibson, Sean Penn, Natalie Dormer, Eddie Marsan, Jennifer Ehle, Jeremy Irvine, David O'Hara, Ioan Gruffudd, Stephen Dillane, Laurence Fox, and Steve Coogan. The film is about professor James Murray, who in 1879 became director of an Oxford University Press project, The New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (now known as the Oxford English Dictionary) and the man who became his friend and colleague, W. C. Minor, a doctor who submitted more than 10,000 entries while he was confined at Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum at Crowthorne after being found not guilty of murder due to insanity. Shot in Dublin in 2016, the film became part of a legal battle between Gibson, Safinia, and Voltage Pictures, delaying its release until 2019 and resulting in the pair disowning the final product. Plot In London in 1872, William Chester Minor, a retired United States Army surgeon, is found not guilty by reason of insanity for killing an innocent stranger, George Merrett, and is sent to Broadmoor. In Oxford, James Murray interviews for a position as editor of what will become the Oxford English Dictionary. An autodidact, he left school at 14 and has no degree. Some Oxford University Press oversight committee members are contemptuous, but Freddie Furnivall describes their current \\"abject defeat\\", saying that the extraordinary Murray may be what they need. When Max M√ºller haughtily asks for qualifications, Murray reels off the long list of ancient and modern languages in which he is proficientThe list available in the Wikipedia article on Murray. and on demand provides a definition‚Äîand probable origins‚Äîof the word \\"clever\\". Over dinner with the committee, Murray hears opposing views. M√ºller insists that it capture English at its current \\"purest peak\\" and setting strict rules for correct speech. Furnivall says that \\"all words are valid in the language. Ancient or new, obsolete or robust on, foreign born or homegrown. The book must inventory every word, every nuance, every twist of etymology and every possible illustrated citation from every English author. All of it or nothing at all.\\" Murray has a solution to this daunting task: Enlist volunteers from everywhere English is spoken. He writes an appeal to English-speaking people around the world, asking them to send their contributions on slips of paper. Booksellers, librarians and newsagents distribute it. The slips pile up. Meanwhile Doctor Brayne receives Minor, who is tormented by flashbacks to the American Civil War. In a moment of lucidity, he saves a guard's life by amputating his leg. He asks that most of his army pension be given to Eliza Merrett, his victim's widow. Muncie, a guard, delivers it personally. She refuses. Brayne promises to protect him from his pursuer, gives him room to paint and allows him his library of rare books. Eliza turns to prostitution. When Muncie brings Christmas dinner to the family, she asks to see Minor and accepts his support. Muncie and the guards give Minor a book that contains Murray's appeal. Minor tells Brayne that he will be \\"all right\\" with this work and more books. Soon a profusion of slips lines his room. Minor submits 1,000 slips to Murray and offers to take on the most elusive words, giving his address as \\"Crowthorne\\". The correspondence between Minor and Murray continues. Eliza returns to thank Minor. He says his life belongs to her. Murray arrives at Broadmoor unannounced, bringing a fascicle to Minor believing that he is a staff member. Murray eventually sees the shackles but is not daunted. \\"You are not alone‚Äîconsanguineous\\", he says. Brayne encourages his visits. Minor offers to teach Eliza to read and write. \\"It is freedom\\", he says. Brayne has hope, but one day Eliza kisses Minor. That night, crying \\"I have killed him again in your heart\\", Minor cuts off his penis, sends his library to Murray and withdraws, sending even Murray away. Vol. 1 is published. Murray receives an honorary doctorate from Oxford and Jowett and Gell plot to remove him. A newspaper publishes an article about the madman and the dictionary. Murray rushes to Broadmoor to find Minor unresponsive. Eliza brings him out of it. Jowett tells Murray that he will soon lose his post, but Furnivall reassures him: He has some \\"tricks\\" for Jowett and Gell. Eliza asks Murray, \\"If I've forgiven him, why should they go on punishing him?\\" They get a hearing but Minor cannot be released. Furnivall and Murray appeal to the home secretary, Winston Churchill, who has Minor deported to the United States. Murray comes to say good bye. Furnivall has a copy of the dictionary's new cover, bearing a royal seal of patronage, granted to \\"Dr James A. H. Murray\\". \\"The fortunate thing about these awful people is they believe in the divine right of rule ... So we use it against them. Your book is safe, James. You are safe at its helm ...\\" \\"Now? Now Dr. Murray is the dictionary\\", Jowett tells Gell, suggesting he take a trip. The film ends with Murray and his family in the garden,Murray's wife, Ada, vanishes abruptly in the kind of shot that might be used to suggest that she had died. In fact, she outlived her husband by many years, dying in 1936 at the age of 90. over text that describes the fates of the professor, the madman and the book.

On June 19, 2018, Judge Ruth Kwan of the Los Angeles County Superior Court denied Gibson's motion for summary adjudication. The multiple lawsuits were the subject of a confidential settlement in April 2019. Gibson and Safinia issued statements distancing themselves from the project and calling the version released by Voltage \\"a bitter disappointment\\".

Named for colonial governor William Shirley in 1913, the square was developed in the 1870s and 1880s as a major locus of civic development after the city of Roxbury was annexed to Boston in 1868. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history Governor Shirley Square is an X-shaped intersection located southeast of Nubian Square (formerly Dudley Square), at the junction of Dunmore and Hampden Streets with Dudley Street, an arterial roadway through Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. Facing this intersection, and arrayed along the southward block of Dudley Street, are six buildings that make up the historic district. All are masonry structures, built in the 19th century between 1872 and 1896. The most visually striking is the 1873 St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church, built of red brick in the Gothic Revival style. Also facing the square are two mixed commercial- residential apartment blocks on the west side of Dudley Street (built in the 1890s), and the c. 1880 McDermott Block, a five-section building that is in mixed residential and commercial use. Further south on Dudley Street stand two municipal buildings: the 1872 Second Empire-styled Roxbury District 9 police station, and an 1874 fire station. McDermott's Block Before the 1840s, the area that is now Governor Shirley Square was largely undeveloped farmland. Development nearby began to its west, where Mount Pleasant area was developed between then and the 1860s. In 1860, a horse-drawn streetcar line was extended down what is now Dudley Street from the then-Dudley Square area, and development expanded into this area. In 1868 the city of Boston annexed Roxbury, and proceeded to make municipal improvements near the square, building the police and fire stations. The growing Catholic population of the area also prompted the construction of St. Patrick's. The intersection was formally dedicated in honor of colonial governor William Shirley in 1913. (Shirley's mansion, a National Historic Landmark, is located several blocks south of this intersection.)

Griffith Dodson, The General Assembly of Virginia (1940-1960) p. 599 A member of the Byrd Organization, Williams participated in its Massive Resistance to racial integration, but left that political crisis to serve as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board for the three years before his death. Early and family life Williams was born in 1905 on a farm in Cold Harbor in Hanover County, Virginia that had been contested during the American Civil War. His paternal grandfather, George Hugh Williams of Charlotte County, had served in the Confederate Army and was wounded during the Battle of Antietam near Sharpsburg, Maryland. After the war, he became a farmer in rural Hanover county, fathering ten children including this Williams' father and namesake Joseph J. Williams. The younger Williams' family included this J.J. Williams Jr. and seven siblings. J.J. Williams Jr. attended Cold Harbor's public schools and graduated from Washington and Henry High School in 1922. He then attended the University of Richmond, receiving a B.A. in history and teaching that subject in Highland Springs High School for several years. He also played varsity baseball at the University of Richmond and later semi-professional baseball on the Everett-Waddey team that won the Virginia state championship in 1933. Williams also coached the Masonic Orphans Home team that won the American Legion junior state championship in 1930. In that year, Williams also received an LLB degree from the University of Richmond's T. C. Williams School of Law.Robert C. Glass and Carter Glass Jr., Virginia Democracy: A History of the Achievements of the Party and its Leaders in the Mother of Commonwealths, the Old Dominion, vol. II (Democratic Historical Association, Inc. 1937) pp. 605-606 On June 30, 1928, Williams married Nellie Ruth Hoover, daughter of the minister of Newbridge Baptist Church, and they had a daughter Betty Ann. The family joined the Gethsemane Christian Church of Hanover. Career Upon graduating law school and being admitted to the bar, Williams practiced under Charles W. Crowder and helped organize the Federal Savings & Loan Association in Sandston. He later served as director and General Counsel of the Franklin Federal Savings and Loan Association of Richmond. Williams also was active in his Presbyterian church, the Freemasons, Acca Temple Shrine, Odd Fellows, Elks, Eagles and Ruritans social organizations. Throughout his life, Williams was active in Democratic party politics, becoming president of the Young Democratic Club of Fairfield district, a delegate to the state Democratic convention in Norfolk in 1936 and the third district secretary. He was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates on August 3, 1937 from Henrico County and re-elected many times. After Senator Harry F. Byrd declared a policy of Massive Resistance to racial integration of Virginia's public schools, Virginia's legislators including Williams participated in a special section of the Virginia General Assembly called by Governor Thomas B. Stanley in August 1956. The legislation they enacted exceeded the recommendations of the Gray Commission on which State Senator Garland Gray and other Byrd loyalists sat, and for which David J. Mays served as counsel. Seven laws were directed against the NAACP and other organizations challenging racial segregation within the Commonwealth. Legislators overwhelmingly adopted them on September 29, 1956, despite Mays' opinion that courts would declare them unconstitutional, as eventually happened. The Speaker of the House of Delegates appointed Williams (who was then chair of the Court and Justice Committee) and relative newcomer William F. Stone to serve on a new joint committee chaired by veteran delegate John B. Boatwright called the \\"Committee on Offenses against the Administration of Justice.\\" The President of the Senate appointed E. Almer Ames Jr. of Onancock and Earl A. Fitzpatrick of Roanoke, to the committee (the latter becoming Vice-Chairman). As the session began in January 1957, it issued letters requesting information from the NAACP as well as the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties and other segregationist organizations. These activities prompted NAACP motions to quash the subpoenas in Richmond and several Virginia counties. In March 1957, the Boatwright Committee in March opined that various segregationist organizations did not commit the expanded legal offenses of champerty, maintenance, barratry, running and capping, nor the unauthorized practice of law. However, the commission's first report issued November 13, 1957 recommended enforcement of the laws against various named NAACP lawyers.Report of the Committee on offenses against the administration of Justice, pp. 19, 20 The subpoenas and other activities soon reduced NAACP membership in Virginia by half. In the report issued in 1959 Boatwright again complained that the Virginia State Bar was spending $5000 on a Jamestown commemoration and $6350 on a new continuing legal education program, but not \\"punishing those guilty of unprofessional conduct and those engaged in the unauthorized practice of law\\" under the Stanley plan's 1956 ethics law expansion.Robert A.

She advocated for women's rights and adequate educational opportunities, as well, serving with numerous organizations to attain equality for indigenous people. In 2012, she was inducted into the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll by the State of Victoria. Early life Eleanor Nain was born on 24 June 1934 on Erub Island of the Torres Strait Islands in Australia. Her mother, Emma Pitt was of the Meriam Mer people in the Torres Straits and her father Fred Nain, from Cape York, Queensland was from the Kuku peoples. When she was eight years old, her father was killed while working on a pearling lugger and a few years later she was orphaned when her mother died. Her mother's mother, Annai Pitt, brought her from Erub Island to the mainland, where they first lived in Cairns and later moved to Bloomfield, Queensland. By the time she was thirteen, Nain was working as a kitchen helper at Lake Eacham Hotel to earn her own living. The discriminatory laws of Queensland toward aboriginal people were some of the harshest in Australia. In 1956, hoping to find less discrimination, Nain moved to the South Yarra suburb of Melbourne and after a brief time, to the Fitzroy suburban area. She had seven children with three partners: Deborah Deacon, Destiny Deacon, Kerry Deacon, Johnny Harding, Janina Harding, Clinton Petersen (who uses the professional name Clinton Nain, in his visual arts work), and Tommy Petersen, taking the surname of Jack Harding, a white wharf labourer from the Maroubra suburb of Sydney. The community was close-knit, and Harding soon was taking part in a network of neighbors helping each other, visiting prisons, and performing other social services to improve their living conditions. In the 1960s, she joined the Aborigines Advancement League and the local branch of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI) to push for civil rights and equality for Indigenous Australians. Harding was one of the activists who pressed for and achieved the passage of the Aboriginal Australian Referendum of 1967, which amended the Constitution of Australia, which laid the groundwork for later more significant legislation for indigenous rights. As a member of the executive of the National Aboriginal and Islander Women's Council, she took part in women's issues, as well as several protests to focus attention on the problems which colonialism had brought to women and indigenous people. Throughout the 1970s, she worked with victims of domestic violence. In spite of her limited schooling, Harding encouraged all of her children to seek higher education. She supported the Abschol movement which began as a scheme to provide scholarships for Aboriginal students. In addition, she served on the boards of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service and the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service. Into the 1980s, Harding remained active. In 1983, she and other women established the Margaret Tucker Hostel to give young, homeless, Aboriginal women safe housing. Harding died on 14 June 1996, in Melbourne and was returned to Darnley Island for burial. Posthumously, an award, named in her honor, \\"The Aunty Eleanor Harding Memorial Award\\" is granted annually since 1999 by the Indigenous Performing Arts Alliance of Victoria to an emerging talent. In 2002, a pictorial tribute created by Harding's daughter Destiny Deacon, entitled Postcards from Mummy was shown at Documenta 11, in Kassel, Germany. The exhibition later was shown in Australia.

The framework has been translated to many languages and is used by the governments of Japan and Israel, among others. It \\"provides a high level taxonomy of cybersecurity outcomes and a methodology to assess and manage those outcomes.\\" Version 1.0 was published by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2014, originally aimed at operators of critical infrastructure. It is being used by a wide range of businesses and organizations and helps shift organizations to be proactive about risk management. In 2017, a draft version of the framework, version 1.1, was circulated for public comment. Version 1.1 was announced and made publicly available on April 16, 2018. Version 1.1 is still compatible with version 1.0. The changes include guidance on how to perform self-assessments, additional detail on supply chain risk management, guidance on how to interact with supply chain stakeholders, and encourages a vulnerability disclosure process. A security framework adoption study reported that 70% of the surveyed organizations see NIST's framework as a popular best practice for computer security, but many note that it requires significant investment. It includes guidance on relevant protections for privacy and civil liberties. Overview The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is designed for individual businesses and other organizations to assess risks they face. The framework is divided into three parts, \\"Core\\", \\"Profile\\" and \\"Tiers\\". The \\"Framework Core\\" contains an array of activities, outcomes and references about aspects and approaches to cybersecurity. The \\"Framework Implementation Tiers\\" are used by an organization to clarify for itself and its partners how it views cybersecurity risk and the degree of sophistication of its management approach. A \\"Framework Profile\\" is a list of outcomes that an organization has chosen from the categories and subcategories, based on its needs and risk assessments. An organization typically starts by using the framework to develop a \\"Current Profile\\" which describes its cybersecurity activities and what outcomes it is achieving. It can then develop a \\"Target Profile\\", or adopt a baseline profile tailored to its sector (e.g. infrastructure industry) or type of organization. It can then define steps switch from its current profile to its target profile.  Functions and categories of cybersecurity activities  The NIST Cybersecurity Framework organizes its \\"core\\" material into five \\"functions\\" which are subdivided into a total of 23 \\"categories\\". For each category, it defines a number of subcategories of cybersecurity outcomes and security controls, with 108 subcategories in all. For each subcategory, it also provides \\"Informative Resources\\" referencing specific sections of a variety of other information security standards, including ISO 27001, COBIT, NIST SP 800-53, ANSI/ISA-62443, and the Council on CyberSecurity Critical Security Controls (CCS CSC, now managed by the Center for Internet Security). Special Publications (SP) aside, most of the informative references requires a paid membership or purchase to access their respective guides. The cost and complexity of the framework has resulted in bills from both houses of Congress that direct NIST to create Cybersecurity Framework guides that are more accessible to small and medium businesses. Here are the functions and categories, along with their unique identifiers and definitions, as stated in the category column of its spreadsheet view of the core of the standard. =Identify= \\"Develop the organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.\\" * Asset Management (ID.AM): The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to business objectives and the organization's risk strategy. * Business Environment (ID.BE): The organization's mission, objectives, stakeholders, and activities are understood and prioritized; this information is used to inform cybersecurity roles, responsibilities, and risk management decisions. * Governance (ID.GV): The policies, procedures, and processes to manage and monitor the organization's regulatory, legal, risk, environmental, and operational requirements are understood and inform the management of cybersecurity risk. * Risk Assessment (ID.RA): The organization understands the cybersecurity risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals. * Risk Management Strategy (ID.RM): The organization's priorities, constraints, risk tolerances, and assumptions are established and used to support operational risk decisions. * Supply Chain Risk Management (ID.SC): The organization's priorities, constraints, risk tolerances, and assumptions are established and used to support risk decisions associated with managing supply chain risk. The organization has in place the processes to identify, assess and manage supply chain risks. =Protect= \\"Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.\\" * Access Control (PR.AC): Access to assets and associated facilities is limited to authorized users, processes, or devices, and to authorized activities and transactions. * Awareness and Training (PR.AT): The organization's personnel and partners are provided cybersecurity awareness education and are adequately trained to perform their information security-related duties and responsibilities consistent with related policies, procedures, and agreements. * Data Security (PR.DS): Information and records (data) are managed consistent with the organization's risk strategy to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. * Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP): Security policies (that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination among organizational entities), processes, and procedures are maintained and used to manage protection of information systems and assets. * Maintenance (PR.MA): Maintenance and repairs of industrial control and information system components is performed consistent with policies and procedures. * Protective Technology (PR.PT): Technical security solutions are managed to ensure the security and resilience of systems and assets, consistent with related policies, procedures, and agreements. =Detect= \\"Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.\\" * Anomalies and Events (DE.AE): Anomalous activity is detected in a timely manner and the potential impact of events is understood. * Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM): The information system and assets are monitored at discrete intervals to identify cybersecurity events and verify the effectiveness of protective measures. * Detection Processes (DE.DP): Detection processes and procedures are maintained and tested to ensure timely and adequate awareness of anomalous events. =Respond= \\"Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.\\" * Response Planning (RS.RP): Response processes and procedures are executed and maintained, to ensure timely response to detected cybersecurity events. * Communications (RS.CO): Response activities are coordinated with internal and external stakeholders, as appropriate, to include external support from law enforcement agencies. * Analysis (RS.AN): Analysis is conducted to ensure adequate response and support recovery activities. * Mitigation (RS.MI): Activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event, mitigate its effects, and eradicate the incident. * Improvements (RS.IM): Organizational response activities are improved by incorporating lessons learned from current and previous detection/response activities. =Recover= \\"Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event.\\" * Recovery Planning (RC.RP): Recovery processes and procedures are executed and maintained to ensure timely restoration of systems or assets affected by cybersecurity events. * Improvements (RC.IM): Recovery planning and processes are improved by incorporating lessons learned into future activities. * Communications (RC.CO): Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties, such as coordinating centers, Internet Service Providers, owners of attacking systems, victims, other CSIRTs, and vendors.  Online Informative References  In addition to informative references in the framework's core, NIST also maintains an online database of informative references. Informative References show relationships between Framework Functions, Categories, and Subcategories and specific sections of standards, guidelines, and best practices common among Framework stakeholders.

The site is an outcropping of the Whin Sill which gives rise to a distinctive flora particular to the thin soil conditions on this bedrock. Location and natural features Bavington Crags is a field in area situated in the north-east of England in the centre of the county of Northumberland, some north-west of the village of Great Bavington. The crags are situated on gently falling farmland, at above sea level. The crags are an outcropping of the Whin Sill, an igneous rock, dolerite, associated with magma flows from ancient volcanos. It gives rise to areas of thin soils, prone to drought in summer, and having a particular soil chemistry supporting a distinct flora set. The site exposes sections of low vertical crag, as well as dip-slope slabs of the Whin Sill Vegetation Bavington Crags is situated within an area of acid grassland characterised by an abundance of crested dog‚Äôs-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and mat-grass (Nardus stricta). The dip-slope areas of the site provide a habitat for, unusual to Northumberland, chives (Allium schoenoprasum), hairy stonecrop (Sedum villosum) bristle club-rush (Isolepis setacea), changing forget-me-not (Myosotis discolor), field madder (Sherardia arvensis), and early hair-grass (Aira praecox). Maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides) is found in dry soil on ledges. Wetter areas exhibit mat-grass, carnation sedge (Carex panicea), spring sedge (C. caryophyllea), cuckoo flower (Cardamine pratensis), red fescue (Festuca rubra), wild thyme (Thymus praecox), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) and lady‚Äôs bedstraw (Galium verum). The condition of Bavington Crags was judged to be unfavourable-recovering in 2012, due to an unusually wet summer in that year affecting growth on the slabs.

Prior to NBCUniversal, Lack held a series of media executive positions, including as the chairman and CEO of Bloomberg Media Group; chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment; and president and chief operating officer of NBCUniversal. He began his career as a journalist and then producer at CBS, winning 10 Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards as a television producer. He is also known for attempting to cover up NBC News' role in the catch and killing of the Harvey Weinstein story by Ronan Farrow.Farhi, Paul \\"Ronan Farrow overcame spies and intimidation to break some of the biggest stories of the #MeToo era\\", The Washington Post, October 10, 2019. In early May 2020, NBCUniversal announced Lack would be leaving his position as NBCUniversal Worldwide News Group President by the end of the month. Early life Lack was born in New York City to a Jewish family. He attended the Browning School, a private school in New York, before graduating from Connecticut boarding school The Gunnery. He studied at the Sorbonne, University of Paris and graduated from Boston University's College of Fine Arts in 1968. After graduation, he appeared as an actor in numerous television commercials and an off-Broadway production. Career After graduating he worked as a producer of TV commercials, joined CBS News in 1976, following the next year with 60 Minutes and from 1978 until 1985, produced CBS Reports. He also served as correspondent on The American-Israeli Connection in 1982. Lack worked with Bill Moyers during the early 80s, as producer of both Our Times With Bill Moyers (1983) and Crossroads (1984). =CBS= In 1976, Lack was hired by 60 Minutes creator Don Hewitt at CBS News as a producer for the personality- driven television show Who's Who. That led to a job as a producer for 60 Minutes. Lack produced such segments as \\"Inside Afghanistan\\" and \\"Kissinger and The Oil Embargo.\\" He wrote and directed the segment \\"The Real Malcolm X: An Intimate Portrait of the Man.\\" He later became the executive producer for CBS Reports, where he stayed for seven years, followed by a four-year stint starting in 1985 as the executive producer of West 57th hosted by Meredith Vieira, a long-format news program. West 57th was known for mixing new storytelling techniques and topics with the same journalistic standards as 60 Minutes. During the course of the show he conducted an extramarital affair with one of his correspondents, Jane Wallace, who described him as \\"almost unrelenting\\" in his pursuit of her. After the affair ended, she says Lack threatened her career and the network paid her for a non-disclosure agreement; a source close to Lack denied the allegations. His work as a CBS producer includes \\"The Boat People\\" (about Vietnamese refugees), \\"Teddy\\" (about Ted Kennedy) and \\"The Defense of the United States\\" (about the Cold War) with Walter Cronkite. =NBC= Lack was hired as president of NBC News in 1993, in part to restore credibility to the news division, after it was discovered the news program Dateline had faked an explosion during a truck safety segment. By Lack's third year, NBC Nightly News with anchor Tom Brokaw became the number- one rated evening news program, beating World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on ABC News. Lack also greatly expanded Dateline, from once weekly to multiple nights each week. After Bryant Gumbel left the Today show, Lack replaced him with Matt Lauer. Lack also moved Today into a new, $15 million street-side studio, known as Studio 1A. With Lauer as anchor, Today became the highest- rated morning news show for the next 16 years. The cable news network MSNBC was also created under Lack. In 2001, Lack left the news division to become president and chief operating officer of NBC, the television network. =Sony= Lack joined Sony Music Entertainment in 2003 as Chairman and CEO. Amid sharply declining sales in the music industry, Lack cut the staff by 25% to about 6,000 people. In 2004, Lack led a merger with BMG. Lack became CEO of the new Sony BMG, a 50‚Äì50 venture with Germany's Bertelsmann that resulted in the second-largest music company in the world. At Sony BMG, he pushed the company further into video, including television programming, and had to contend with the erosion of sales because of music file-sharing services such as Napster. In 2005, he signed Bruce Springsteen to a $110 million contract. In 2006 he became the chairman of Sony BMG. He later created SonyBMG Films, a division that produced numerous titles including Cadillac Records starring Beyonce. In 2008 he left the company. =Bloomberg= In 2008, Lack returned to broadcast journalism, joining Bloomberg as CEO of its Media Group, running television, radio and digital properties, including 11 television channels internationally. The New York Times reported that he cut losses in half and doubled revenue. He became chairman of Bloomberg Media Group in 2013 and stayed with Bloomberg until 2014. =NBCUniversal (2015‚Äì2020)= Lack rejoined NBC News and MSNBC in 2015 in the aftermath of a crisis generated when NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams was suspended without pay for six months for misrepresenting events which occurred while he was covering the 2003 Iraq War. NBC News also faced a decline in ratings for Today and poor ratings for MSNBC. Lack named Lester Holt as the new anchor of NBC Nightly News to replace Williams. The show became a ratings success, coming in first for the full 2014‚Äì2015 season (four months of which were anchored by Williams). After Williams' suspension was over, Lack decided to bring him back as the breaking news anchor for MSNBC as part of a shift toward hard news in that network's daytime programming. Lack announced closer collaboration between NBC News and MSNBC, cancelled three opinion-based daytime MSNBC shows, and gave Meet the Press host Chuck Todd a daily afternoon program called MTP Daily. MSNBC ratings subsequently improved in the first quarter of 2016, with daytime viewership up by more than 100%. Lack also unified the digital operations of NBC News and MSNBC under a new division head. Today became the first-place morning news show, surpassing Good Morning America in total viewers as of March 31, 2016, following a six-month lead among the 25‚Äì54-year-olds. In January 2017, Lack announced the hiring of Megyn Kelly away from Fox News saying in a memo, \\"She's demonstrated tremendous skill and poise, and we're lucky to have her.\\" Kelly was reportedly being paid between $15 million and $20 million a year at NBCUniversal for both a Sunday evening show and the mid- morning Megyn Kelly Today, along with election coverage. In late October 2018 Business Insider reported that Kelly would depart the network following controversial remarks on the nature of blackface. In 2019, investigative journalist Ronan Farrow reported that Lack downplayed a human resources complaint of rape against Today anchor Matt Lauer in 2014. Lauer was not fired until late 2017. Farrow also reported that Lack had ordered Richard Greenberg to scuttle reporting on the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases because \\"it was an Andy decision.\\" Farrow later published his work in The New Yorker.Aurthur, Kate and Ramin Setoodeh. \\"Ronan Farrow Book Alleges Matt Lauer Raped NBC News Colleague\\", Variety, October 8, 2019. Farrow also reported that NBC News hired a \\"Wikipedia whitewasher\\" who removed references to NBC News's role in the Harvey Weinstein case from several Wikipedia articles, including Lack's.Farhi, Paul. \\"Ronan Farrow overcame spies and intimidation to break some of the biggest stories of the #MeToo era\\", The Washington Post, October 10, 2019. On May 4, 2020, NBCUniversal fired Lack following the backlash over his role in killing Farrow's reporting on Weinstein. Personal life Lack married twice. In 1970, he married Pamela Ann Blafer in a Jewish ceremony at the Temple Emanu‚ÄêEl in Manhattan. Lack is married to Betsy Kenny Lack, head of global brand strategy for Snapchat, with whom he has two sons. He was honored by the UJA-Federation of New York‚Äôs Broadcast, Cable & Film Division on April 9, 2013 for his generous support.UJA-Federation of New York: \\"Andrew Lack Honored at Broadcast Event\\" April 10, 2013 References  External links  * Andrew Lack at NBCUniversal * American media executives American Jews 1947 births Living people The Gunnery alumni Peabody Award winners Businesspeople from New York City NBC executives Bloomberg L.P. people Presidents of NBC News Browning School alumni ","title":"Andrew Lack (executive)"},{"id":"51230323","text":"Gyaritus bangueyensis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

From 1978‚Äì1985 Balanchine-specialist Patricia Neary held the post of ballet director. Starting in 1985, Uwe Scholz, with 26 years the youngest director of a dance company in Europe, took over the management of the Zurich Ballet until 1991. Subsequently, Bernd Roger Bienert led the Zurich Ballet until 1996. Heinz Spoerli, ballet director from 1996‚Äì2012, established the company among the leading European ballet formations. A neoclassical dance style was cultivated with ballets like The Goldberg Variations, A Midsummer Night's Dream or Peer Gynt and great classical ballets such as Giselle or The Nutcracker. The company also presented works of other choreographers such as George Balanchine, Mats Ek, William Forsythe, Jiri Kylian, Hans von Manen or Twyla Tharp. Since the 2012‚Äì13 season Christian Spuck, former choreographer of the Stuttgart Ballet, leads the Ballet Z√ºrich.

In the early years of his artistic activity, he composed music for theater and sound design; he later found its way into a personal relationship between silent cinema and music: by inverting the relationship between images and sounds, in his concerts he offers songs with the accompaniment of silent film sequences that serve as a sort of visual soundtrack. A strong visual element, the fusion of languages used, and the immediacy of the melodies are all peculiarities of his compositions.  Biography  Anzovino was introduced to music at the age of 10, and he soon developed a natural aptitude for writing.Remo Anzovino ‚Äì Essenza Glocal (Locals Magazine, 14/11/12) In eighth grade he founded The Left Hand Band together with his school friends. The singer of the group was his brother Marco, three-years younger, who became a popular songwriter (\\"Radio1 Premio Recanati\\" plaque, 2001) and rhythm guitarist whom he shares each subsequent experience with. He recorded with the band in 1994 an album called Mal√¨a (on cassette), nowhere to be found today. In 1994, while he was still in high school, Anzovino was hired for his first stage music for a theater show from Fabio Scaramucci's Ortoteatro company, finding its way into the instrumental language.La nuova in pantaloni (Il Piave, 24/03/07) In the same year he began to work with some agencies for the music of promotional and commercial films. In 2002 he ventured for the first time with the music for a silent film commissioned by the Cineteca di Bologna. In the period 2002‚Äì2007 he gave a soundtrack to more than thirty silent films, mostly true masterpieces of the period, working with major film libraries and participating in festivals in the area, including the \\"Cinema Ritrovato\\" in Bologna (2004) and \\"Le giornate del Cinema Muto\\" in Pordenone (2003).Immagini da ascoltare ‚Äì musicare un film muto oggi (Wuz, 14/03/07) In 2005 he composed a score for symphony orchestra for the film Nanook of the North: A Story of Life and Love in the Actual Arctic premiered in the charming Piazza San Marco in Pordenone, with the simultaneous screening of the film, receiving more than 10 minutes of applause. The following year, the soundtrack won the Special Audience Award at the Bolzano \\"Rimusicazioni\\" festival. In 2005 he won second place in the Prix dedicated to Maestro Angelo Francesco Lavagnino. In 2007 he received the \\"Moret D'Aur\\" prize by a jury of twenty journalists of Friuli Venezia Giulia, as an Emerging Character in showbiz. In 2011 the same jury, after only four years, rewarded him with the \\"Moret D'Aur\\" as the representative showbiz personality of the region.Servizio del TG3 Friuli Venezia Giulia sulla premiazione avvenuta il 10 ottobre 2011 On 15 June 2006 he released his first album, Dispari (which collects a milonga inspired by Tina Modotti (Que viva Tina!), and some of the themes originally composed for silent movies ‚Äì here reconceived in a completely autonomous way.Comunicato ufficiale della casa discografica romana CNI sull'album Dispari dopo il grande successo dell'anteprima su iTunes The album reached the #1 position in the Italian jazz chart on iTunes, and all subsequent albums would do the same. In March 2007, his composition \\"L'immagine ritrovata\\", taken from Dispari, was chosen by Simone Cristicchi as the main theme opening and closing the docu-movie about asylums \\"Dall'altra parte del cancello\\" (directed by Alberto Puliafito), which was attached to Cristicchi's eponymous album (Sony BMG) published in coincidence with the San Remo Festival victory: Cristicchi also used the composition in his theatrical performance\\"Centro di igiene mentale ‚Äì Storie di matti e di manicomi\\". On 3 September 2007 Anzovino was invited by Ente dello Spettacolo and La rivista del Cinematografo to perform at the 64th Venice Film Festival with a specifically written show. He proposed a new experiment: reversing the usual relationship between music and images accompanying the execution of songs with sequences taken from silent film masterpieces, making each piece match with a completely different movie. The music is the real protagonist, images comment her emotional/psychological content serving as a veritable visual track.Messaggero Veneto 16.9.2007 Le musiche per il cinema di Remo Anzovino On 17 January 2008 he participated in the Maurizio Costanzo Show on Canale 5 channel. On 1 October 2008 he released his second album, Tab√π, a musical meditation on contemporary transgressions. This album established him as the new revelation of the Italian instrumental music. A disc with a strong rhythmic vitality and ideally dedicated to the movement of the body as a tool of liberation of instincts. The rhythm section was headed by U.T. Gandhi and Danilo Gallo; Mauro Ottolini joined the album on trombone.Comunicato ufficiale della casa discografica si Saluzzo Egea music sull'album Tab√π On 26 April 2010 Anzovino released his third album, Igloo ‚Äì Piccola sinfonia per orchestra e duetti contemporanei, on which the encoded symphonic movements ‚Äì entrusted to an orchestra of more than 40 elements ‚Äì are counterpointed by the duets between Anzovino and some of the greatest Italian musicians on the international scene: with Franz Di Cioccio's drums (PFM), with the clarinet of Gabriele Mirabassi, with the bass of Enzo Pietropaoli, with the guitar of Bebo Ferra, and with the two Top Jazz 2009 artists (the annual referendum organized by the historic magazine \\"Musica Jazz\\") Francesco Bearzatti on saxophone and Luca Aquino on trumpet. It is a record that represents a bridge between classical music and the most contemporary jazz music. The cover was created by Davide Toffolo, one of the most important Italian cartoonists as well as leader of the punk rock band \\"Tre Allegri Ragazzi Morti\\". After working for the piano-drums duet of the title track of Igloo, Anzovino and Franz Di Cioccio consolidated their relationship into the project of a live set: Di Cioccio on drums and Anzovino on piano, one against another, to represent the clash between two fires, and the meeting of two generations of musicians and two worlds. In December 2010, he featured as a special guest the album Primitivi del dub (La Tempesta Dischi) by \\"Tre Allegri Ragazzi Morti\\", produced by Paolo Baldini: he played Fender Rhodes and clavinet on the song \\"La rivolta dell'avvocato\\" (literally, \\"The lawyer's revolt\\"), so titled in his honor. In March 2012 he participated together with Dargen D'Amico and Roberto Dellera from Afterhours, as music composer/piano special guest/string director on the album Fili invisibili (Metatron) by DJ Aladyn, in the eight- hands song \\"Mi vuoi bene\\". In June 2012 signed the theme song and deadlifts for LA7 channel's show In Bianco e Nero, an early-evening summer programme of the black and white masterpieces of American cinema, including The Killing and Paths of Glory by Stanley Kubrick, Billy Wilder's Witness for the Prosecution, and The Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin. The theme song chosen for the program was \\"Giostra\\", from the album Igloo. On 8 October 2012Egea Music. Il luned√¨ di Egea n. 364 del 08/10/12 his fourth album Viaggiatore Immobile (Egea Music) was released, produced by sound designer Taketo Gohara, with orchestral arrangements by Stefano Nanni and cover signed by Oliviero Toscani. For the first time one of his discs was also released in LP format. Some principal musicians of the orchestra of La Scala in Milan contributed to the album recordings ‚Äì and with them some prominent musicians such as Vincenzo Vasi, Alessandro \\"Asso\\" Stefana, Mauro Ottolini, Edodea Quartet (directed by Edoardo De Angelis), Achille Succi. The disc ends with the song \\"9 Ottobre 1963 (Suite for Vajont)\\", performed with 42 male voices of the Ruda Polyphonic Choir directed by Fabiana Noro, in memory of the Vajont tragedy. On 18 February 2013, the newspaper\\"Il Fatto Quotidiano published in its first page the incipit manuscript of \\"9 Ottobre 1963 (Suite for Vajont)\\" and the image of Anzovino with the heading \\"Soundtrack of the Week\\", reporting the following thought of the composer: \\"Music can sometimes help memory.\\" On 15 September 2013, the 50th anniversary of the disaster, Anzovino was invited by the Vajont Foundation (which brings together, among others, the municipalities of Longarone, Erto and Casso, Castellavazzo and Vajont) to hold a concert on the dam, in the heart of the landslide in Erto, that drew 2,000 people, in a climate of great emotion. The composition \\"9 Ottobre 1963 (Suite for Vajont)\\", which Anzovino opened and closed the concert with, was recognized by the Vajont Foundation as the official music of the memory of the tragedy. On 7 October 2013, Anzovino won the \\"Premio Anima\\" award \\"to the growth of an ethical conscience ‚Äì music section,\\" for his composition \\"9 Ottobre 1963 (Suite for Vajont)\\", a piece composed by the pianist in memory of the Vajont tragedy. The award is given every year under the patronage of the Presidency of the Italian Republic to enhance the contribution made by the art world personalities and culture that have excelled in their respective categories for the value of content and communicative power of the message and the significant contribution to the growth of the culture of ethics and accountability in the country. The jury ‚Äì chaired by Luigi Abete ‚Äì gave this explanation to the award: \\" \\"9 Ottobre 1963 (Suite for Vajont)\\" is a strong and overwhelming composition showing Anzovino's great human and artistic sensitivity: only a son of that land could compose it.\\" On 2 December 2013, preceded by the single \\"No Smile (Buster Keaton)\\" ‚Äì a homage to the comedian ‚Äì the album Vivo was released. This was his first live album, and the fifth of his discography. It contained the recording of the concert held on 20 December 2013 at the \\"Auditorium Parco della Musica\\" in Rome, the DVD video of the \\"Concerto della Rimembranza\\" concert on the Vajont dam, and a collectible photo booklet with photos from the concert in Rome signed by Gianluca Moro. The album cover is a photo of the band that has accompanied Anzovino in the recordings, formed by Vincenzo Vasi, Marco Anzovino and Alberto Milani, taken in the tent/dressing room a few minutes before the concert on the Vajont dam. In an interview with Ernesto Assante for Repubblica.it, Anzovino explained his choice: \\"I have always felt to be an unconventional pianist, I tried to form a band and put around the piano some new and original sound. I wanted to express a liberating idea of the piano, which becomes as the lead singer of a rock band in a concert that is definitely a party, where the Music changes night after night.\\" On 7 December 2013, the Lelio Luttazzi Foundation invited Anzovino to hold a special concert for piano solo in honor of the great artist from Trieste at the \\"Palazzo delle Esposizioni\\" in Rome, as the event of the exhibition \\"LelioSwing 50 anni di storia italiana\\". On 19 April 2014, Vivo was released in a double LP gatefold 180 gram vinyl edition, with an attached DVD of the historic \\"Concerto della Memoria\\" concert on the Vajont dam, all enriched by a photographic dossier of sixteen full-color pages in collectible vinyl format signed by Gianluca Moro. On Friday 25 April 2014, Anzovino was awarded the Premio San Marco 2014 prize in the Room of the Municipal Council of Pordenone, the highest honor that the city assigns by the hands of the Mayor, on the advice of the prestigious Academy of San Marco and the Propordenone association, \\"to those citizens who excelled so much in the various fields of human activity (arts, humanities, sciences, business, sports, social commitment) as to give prominence to the name of the city and can be offered as an example, particularly for the younger ones\\". The motivation: \\"Composer and pianist, born in 1976, despite his young age he has already demonstrated considerable talent with excellent results in national and international contexts, where he was appreciated for its artistic and human qualities. He composed the music for silent film masterpieces and important plays. Its prestigious concerts have enjoyed considerable success ‚Äì just remember, among all, the one of 2013 at the Vajont dam in the 50th anniversary of the tragedy. He's an extraordinary musician, a master of emotional description, of the same magic of Rota and Morricone. Although more and more successes often lead him out of his city, it remains strongly attached to his land, which he maintains a strong emotional bond with.\\" He was nominated Academician by \\"Accademia San Marco\\", which includes the most prominent citizens in the history of the city such as Lino Zanussi, Aldo Savio, Armando Cimolai and other praiseworthy ones. Anzovino usually gives concerts in special schedules and natural areas. Among others, the list includes the concerts held at dawn on the beach in Cesenatico (15 August 2010), in the reserve of Torre Guaceto (Brindisi) (24 August 2012) and in Pordenone, in the nearbies of the river Noncello, symbolic place of the city (12 July 2014), and the concert at high altitude at about 2,000 meters in Sella Nevea (10 August 2014) for the \\"No Borders Music Festival\\", the awakening concert at 7:30 am in Piazza San Giacomo, Udine (4 July 2015Remo Anzovino, Concerto del Risveglio a Udine ‚Äì Metropolitan, YouTube, 4 luglio 2015), in Vicenza in the consecrated temple of Santa Corona (4 October 2015) (and in the evening of the same day at Ragusa in Piazza della Repubblica), the recital in the function room of the Grand Hotel of Rimini, iconic place of Fellinian imagery, on 20 December 2015. In an interview given on the occasion of the concert at dawn on the Noncello in Pordenone, he declared: \\"Dawn is the time at which something is born and something dies, it is the closest time to the soul. I really like to be the soundtrack of that time.\\" The concert marked the artistic history of Pordenone and ranked among the dawn music events with more participation, establishing ‚Äì as evidenced by Ernesto Assante, music journalist for the newspaper \\"La Repubblica\\" ‚Äì \\"almost a record. I difficultly recall so many people for a sunrise concert\\". The newspaper of the Friuli Venezia Giulia, \\"Il Messaggero Veneto\\", asked Remo Anzovino to write an editor's review of the construction of the dawn concert, published on the front page on 14 July 2014 with the title \\"Sinfonia di una Citt√†\\". He participated in the tribute album to Ces√°ria √âvora and Cape Verdean music with a piano and voice duet with Gino Paoli of \\"Santo me\\", the Italian version of \\"Sao Tom√® no Equador\\", also as producer and arranger.

I loved his music. And so the idea of this \\"tribute\\" ‚Äì which he wrote some very beautiful, well chosen and poignant pieces for ‚Äì came to life\\".Messaggero Veneto 24.10.2015 \\"Quanto ci manca il poeta che fu vittima della politica\\" During the premiere of the recital, the song \\"L'Alba dei Tram\\" (music by Anzovino and verses of Giuliano Sangiorgi, leader of the Italian band \\"Negramaro\\") was performed for the first time.

The photograph shows Pasolini at dawn in his last home in Torre di Chia. The internal notes of the disc were edited by the journalists Tommaso Cerno, Jonathan Giustini, Angela Felice and by Anzovino himself, explaining: \\"The music of \\"L'Alba dei Tram\\" began to grow inside of me two years ago, after a visit by night to the Idroscalo of Ostia, where Pasolini was murdered... The music was born after many months and called Inilosap, thinking about the name of the poet backward, as if rewinding the film of his intellectual and human story the movie could remain even more intact every time... The viscerally popular side of Pasolini has always struck me... So I felt it would be great if the music had become a song and if the author of the verses were my age, somebody whowas born ‚Äì like me ‚Äì after his death... I played to music to Giuliano, who decided to give me such beautiful verses... This little work of mine has no claim to be exhaustive nor even to explain Pasolini... This disc is just a set of images, which I hope will come from the sounds to stimulate to reread (or ‚Äì for the youngest ‚Äì to discover for the first time) pages and universal images fulloof disruptive force, even today, and perhaps even today indispensable\\".Egea Music The album \\"L'Alba dei Tram ‚Äì Dedicato a Pasolini\\" entered for two consecutive weeks in the FIMI ranking of best-selling albums in Italy, reaching #56 position.FIMI On 25 February 2016, Emanuela Audisio's docu-movie Pasolini maestro corsaro, which Anzovino signed the entirely soundtrack for, received the \\"Nastro d'Argento\\" special mention.

They are from Walsall, West Midlands, England. They were formed in early 2013 from the fragments of two local bands, Stone Broken comprises Rich Moss, vocals and guitar, Chris Davis, lead guitar, Robyn Haycock, drums and backing vocals, and Kieron Conroy, bass. The band self-released their debut EP, The Crow Flies, in 2014. Their first album, All In Time, was released independently in January 2016. Having signed to the Frontiers Records label later that year, the contract was subsequently dissolved and Stone Broken signed to the Spinefarm Records label in 2017. In 2018, the band released their second album, Ain‚Äôt Always Easy. In late 2019, the debut album was re-issued on Spinefarm, and included a re- recording of their best known song, \\"Wait For You\\".  History  Stone Broken was formed in early 2013 when Richard Moss and Robyn Haycock decided to start a new band following the death of the guitar player in their previous band, Black Lake, as a consequence of alcohol addiction. They were joined by bass player Kieron Conroy, who had previously been in a band called Black Diamond Bullet. Kieron introduced his new bandmates to guitarist Chris Davis, who had also played in Black Diamond Bullet. The name Stone Broken was decided upon after drummer Robyn noted that the money required to get the band established would in all probability leave them ‚Äòstone broke‚Äô.Will Simpson, \\"Stone Broken\\", Louder, 24 November 2016.

However, it was not until March 2014 that Stone Broken played their first public gig supporting a Motorhead tribute band at the Route 44 venue in Birmingham. The band approached producer Romesh Dodangoda at Long Wave Studios in South Wales to produce a debut EP consisting of five original tracks. This EP, The Crow Flies, was self-released in October 2014, supported by a music performance video for the track \\"Let Me Go\\". The band played further shows in the first part of 2015 and returned to Long Wave Studios with a view to recording a second EP, to feature another five tracks. However, when the new recordings were completed, it was decided to collate an album from the ten songs recorded to date. By October 2015, Stone Broken signed a management deal with Peter Keevil of TMR Band Management. A month later the band announced that their debut album, entitled All In Time, was to be released worldwide on 29 January 2016. All In Time featured 10 tracks, produced and remastered by Romesh Dodangoda. Stone Broken released \\"Stay All Night\\" as the first official single from All In Time on 27 November 2015. It was accompanied by a video produced by Video Ink. The release was named single of the week on Kerrang! Radio and was daytime playlisted on DAB station, Planet Rock.

(BUSC) is an independent theatre company based at the University of Bonn, Germany. It was founded by students of the Department of English, American, and Celtic Studies. The University of Bonn  History  The BUSC was founded in November 1992 by English Studies students Thilo Veenema and Magnus Huber after the previous theatre company at the English Department had broken up. According to ¬ß21 BGB, it is a strictly non-commercial organisation. In 2015, the group had about a hundred active members and nearly two hundred former members. The group's main aim is the promotion of art and culture in Bonn and the area, especially the promotion of the works of Shakespeare, his contemporaries and other English-language authors. The group is particularly interested in cooperating with schools in the area. Furthermore, the BUSC collaborates with Shakespeare scholars like Uwe Baumann (University of Bonn) and Russell Jackson (University of Birmingham), the latter of which has previously worked as an advisor for film adaptations of Shakespeare's work. The company's performance programmes usually contain academic articles on the play performed, written by professors and lecturers at the University of Bonn. Normally, the BUSC performs about two plays per year, one in the summer term and one in the winter term. All plays are performed in the original English version, the only exception being ‚ÄúVell Jed√∂hns w√§√§je n√º√ü‚Äù, a Rhineland dialect translation of Much Ado About Nothing, in the year 2000. For this production the group was awarded the ‚ÄúMartin- Lehnert-Preis‚Äù by the German Shakespeare Society. Most performances take place at the Brotfabrik theatre in Bonn-Beuel, where the plays are performed for six to ten days in a row. The average number of performances per production is seven. The Brotfabrik theatre in Bonn-Beuel Apart from Shakespeare's plays, the group also performs tragedies and comedies by Christopher Marlowe, John Ford, Oscar Wilde or T.S. Eliot. In 2002, the group staged their first musical with Little Shop of Horrors. In 2003 and 2004, the BUSC were invited to perform at the reconstructed Globe Theatre in Neuss, Germany, with their productions of Timon of Athens and ‚ÄúVell Jed√∂hns w√§√§je n√º√ü/Much Ado About Nothing‚Äù. Within Bonn, the group also performed at the Haus der Springmaus theatre, on Bonn's Museumsmeile, and Poppelsdorf Palace. In 2002, the group's ten year anniversary was celebrated with a one-week Shakespeare festival consisting of performances and talks. Every now and then, members of the BUSC have the opportunity to attend workshops with theatre professionals, for example in Shakespeare's home town of Stratford-upon-Avon in 2005.

Historically due to the Roman law principle of Mater semper certa est (the mother is always certain) this action was not available to mothers, but since the introduction of in- vitro fertilisation this has changed. It is an act that confers legitimacy on the child.  Overview  When a child is born the mother is known, but the father is not certain. When the mother is married, the husband is presumed to be the father (see presumption of legitimacy). When the mother is unmarried, some jurisdictions require the father to take extra steps to be recognised as the father, the presumption of paternity does not apply. The laws vary between jurisdictions but common themes are: * the mother must give consent * a child can only be 'recognised' once * if the child is old enough it must also give consent * it can often be done prior to the birth of the child There is no requirement that the recogniser actually be the biological father. In fact, if the child already has a legal father (by the presumption of paternity or by prior recognition) the biological father may not be allowed to recognise their own biological child unless the legal father voluntarily denies fatherhood; a child may only have one legal father. This can happen in cases where the presumed father discovers a child is not their biological child (see paternity fraud). In this case the law holds the rights of the \\"social father\\" above those of the \\"biological father\\". In all cases it is a voluntary act by the father to recognise a child. Recognition is not generally possible in the case of mothers under the principle of Mater semper certa est (The mother is always certain). However, it may be possible in the case of anonymous birth. = History = The Napoleonic Code in 1804 had the concept of recognition (Book 1, Title VII) and was a major influence on the civil codes of much of continental Europe due to the Napoleonic Wars, and throughout the world due to European colonies. It prohibited paternity suits and claims for child support in the case where both the mother and father were unwed. The purpose was to protect the legally married heterosexual reproductive family, there was no room in this system for natural children, mothers outside of marriage, and involuntary paternity. In an era without DNA testing, the discussions often revolved around evidence. In the modern era DNA testing has made definitive proof of paternity possible but also the concept of parenthood has expanded (e.g. same sex parenting). Intersection with the rights of children, state support of children and gender equality means this is a rapidly evolving area of law. = Worldwide = Similar concepts exist in Asian countries for the same reason: the protection of married heterosexual men from paternity suits from unmarried women. However, even there is introduction of DNA testing has changed the situation in recent years.  The Netherlands  Article 199 of Book 1 of the Burgerlijk Wetboek determines that the man who recognises a child becomes the child's legal father. This can be done by a public instrument, or by an act of recognition, completed by an officer of the Register office. It also the lists situations where 'recognition' may be considered invalid. * the blood relationship between the recogniser and the mother is such that it would not be possible to marry. * the recogniser has not reached the age of 16. * the mother has not given consent (if the child has not reached the age of 16). * the child has not given consent (if the child is older than 12) * the child already has two legal parents. The requirement for the mother to consent can be overridden by a court, but only if the recogniser is the biological father, or if the lifelong partner of the mother consented to an act that could have led to the birth of the child, unless it would disrupt the relationship between the mother and the child, or it would not be in the best interests of the child. The act of recognising a child does not automatically grant legal guardianship, this must be applied for separately via court order. Since 2014 the act of recognition is also available to women who wish to be recognised as the mother of a child born to another women, for example if they are in a lesbian relationship. In 2012 over 90% of all children of unwed mothers were recognised before the first year of age. Of the children born in 2000 only 9% remained unrecognised in 2012.Kinderen van niet gehuwde ouders vaker erkend. CBS 2012. = Denial of fatherhood = Denial of fatherhood is possible, but only if the presumed father is not the biological father. This procedure can be initiated by any of the father, the mother or the child. * the mother within one year of the birth of the child * the father within one year of when he becomes aware that he is not the biological father * the child within three years of becoming aware of who the biological father is, or before three years after the age of majority.  Belgium  Recognition in Belgium is set out in Article 315 and subsequent articles of the Belgian Burgerlijk Wetboek. * A child born to a married woman or within 300 days of divorce has the husband as legal father (presumption of paternity) * The presumption does not apply if the presumed parents were not (formally) living together 300 days prior to the birth, unless the presumed parents make a declaration at the registration of the birth. * The recognition can occur at birth, or later via any legal instrument, with the exception of a testament. * A child can be recognised only once, subsequent acts of recognition are invalid as long as the previous acts are valid. ** If there is no mother on the birth certificate, and act of recognition can be done by a woman. ** If there is no legal father, another women may recognise the child. The child will then legally have two mothers, the second mother is then referred to as 'meemoeder' (\\"co-mother\\"). If the man/woman recognising a child is married to someone other than the legal mother of the child, then the act of recognition cannot be enforced until the spouse has been notified. A challenge to the presumed legal fatherhood can be started: * by the mother, within one year of the birth; * by the legal father, within one year of discovering they are not the biological father; * by the biological father, within one year of discovering they are the biological father; * by the child, no earlier than the age of 12 and no later than the age of 22, or within one year of discovery the legal father is not the biological father. A challenge cannot succeed if the legal father is the social father; that is, they act as a father toward the child, and they are considered the father by others (in possession of status ‚Äì ').  France  Whether the parents are married or not, maternal affiliation is automatically established once the name of the woman is on the birth certificate. By contrast, if the parents are not married to each other, the presumption of paternity does not apply. By article 312 and the following articles of the Civil Code, paternity may be assumed in this case by a man wishing to recognise the child, by a declaration made in a public instrument before: * a registrar, recognition is inserted into the birth certificate if it is made simultaneously with the declaration of birth, otherwise by explicit act. * a notary, by deed, for example a valid testament. * a court (the statement is inserted in the minutes of hearing). Recognition can be done before birth (\\"d√©claration sur le ventre\\"), during the declaration of birth or afterwards. France recognises the possibility of anonymous birth for unwed women, in which case the mother's name does not appear on the birth certificate. In this case recognition by the mother after the fact is also possible.  Germany  The legal framework for the recognition of paternity is defined in section 1594 of the German Civil Code. A child has in certain circumstances (initially) no legal father. This is always the case where no legal presumption of paternity exists, for example if at the time of birth the mother is unmarried or divorced or the marriage is legally annulled, or if the husband is deceased more than 300 days before the child's birth. The same applies to a child whose origin is unclear (a foundling) or if the previous paternity in the context of paternity fraud was excluded. In these cases, an recognition of paternity by a man together with the consent of the child's mother results in the legal paternity of the child. Whether the recogniser is also the biological father of the child is irrelevant; the legislature intended to create with the process of the recognition of paternity the possibility for legal paternity for men that fill an actual father role (\\"social father\\"), in the absence of a biological father (for example in blended families). The act of recognition is not an assertion by a man that he is in fact the biological father of the child.  Poland  Family and Guardianship Code in art. 72 indicates that the recognition of paternity can occur if * there is no presumption that the father of the child is the husband of the mother (such presumption exists if the child was born during the marriage or before three hundred days after the divorce). * the presumption has been rebutted (this can only occur as a result of an action for denial of paternity). In the case of any of the above two situations, paternity can occur by the acknowledgement of paternity by the father or by judgement of a court. The statement necessary to establish paternity may be submitted by a person if they are at least 16 years of age and there are no grounds for legal incapacitation. If a man having recognised paternity does not have full legal capacity, he may make a statement necessary for the recognition of paternity only before a court guardianship. The recognition is unallowed if a child is major.

While there is no provision in the Dhammathats that a Buddhist woman cannot marry another religious man, in this period, the Buddhist woman who married a non-Buddhist man almost lost her rights to divorce, inheritance, succession and their child's legal status. Almost all matters of divorce, inheritance, succession, partition and guardianship of children were decided by a foreign judge. To protect Buddhist women who married non-Buddhist men, the Legislative Council passed that relating Act in 1939 Myanmar Law Act No.24 of 1939). The Act came into force on 1 April 1941, but it was ineffective because of the 2nd World war. After independence, The Parliament of union padded the Myanmar Buddhist Women's Special Marriage and Succession Act, 1954(Myanmar Act No.32 of 1954) which repealed the former 139 Act. However, when the Myanmar Buddhist Women's Special Marriage and Succession Act, 1954 was passed, Myanmar Buddhist women who were married to non-Buddhist men did not receive relief from it because it had a lot of weaknesses. In order to provide effective legal protection to Myanmar Buddhist Women, Pyidaungsu Hluttaw passed Myanmar Buddhist Women Special Marriage Law, 2015 (PyiDaungSu Hluttaw Law No.50 of 2015) in 2015. Marriage to non-Buddhist Having dealt with marriages in cases where both man and woman are Myanmar Buddhist, it is further necessary to examine the law as a Union in which one of the parties is of that nationality and faith. Under the Myanmar regime all persons, whatsoever their race or creed, were governed by the Dhammathats, and since, by international law, marriage is decided by the law of the place where it is celebrated, it follows that the legal marriage according to Myanmar custom could have been contracted in Myanmar, before the annexation between Buddhist and adherents of other religions, and if the marriage was valid when contracted, it cannot have become invalid by any subsequent change of law, unless there had been a statuary provision invalidating such marriage.1 Ma Chain vs Ma Nyein case Ma Chain vs Ma Nyein case was the first case of Myanmar Buddhist women who marry with Non- Buddhist men. In Thibaw regime, Myanmar Buddhist woman and Christian man married. While these two people were staying married, Myanmar was colonized by British. In 1872, The Christian Marriage Act was published by British. The Christian husband died after the Christian Marriage Act, 1872 was published. And his sister filed a suit that the Buddhist women was not unlawful wife according to the Christian Marriage Act, 1872 and she should not receive the right of ownership of the brother's property. But, the court decided that she was the legal wife because they married before the Christian Marriage Act, 1972 and she got the right of ownership of her husband's property.3 After considering this case, the various decisions as regards mixed marriages has been to place Myanmar Buddhist women in a highly disadvantageous position. Religious marriage acts In 1872, the British passed Christian Marriage Act, Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Marriage Act, Mohammedan Marriage Act and so on. And, the court was decided by this laws. So, Myanmar Buddhist women who marry with Non-Buddhist men was highly disadvantaged position. According to Hindu Marriage Act, a Hindu cannot contract a legal marriage with any woman unless she belongs to his own caste; hence a Hindu of the Brahmins, Kshatriya, and Vaishya or Oudra caste cannot contract a valid marriage in the orthodox style with a Myanmar Buddhist.4 If Myanmar Buddhist women want to marry with Mohammedan husband, their marriage is invalid unless the latter embraces the Mohammedan faith or any other revealed religion believing in one God and the marriage is celebrated according to the rites of the Mohammedan faith.5 And, Myanmar Buddhist women was also suffered in Sino-Myanmar marriage. A Chinese Buddhist can contract valid marriage with a Myanmar Buddhist as regard the requisites of such a marriage the law has passed through different stages. At first the law required that the marriage should be celebrated not only according to Myanmar custom but also according to Chinese custom. If the Chinese custom could not celebrate while they married, their marriage is invalid. But, Myanmar Buddhist women can marry freely with her consent according to the Myanmar customary law but other religious customary laws restricted their marriage. Thus, most of Myanmar Buddhist women came into unlawful wives and lesser wives. The Myanmar Buddhist Women's Special Marriage and Succession Act, 1939 In 1939, there was a races conflicts because of political, economic and religious. And the nationalist aware Myanmar Buddhist Women suffering. The Buddhist woman who married non-Buddhist man almost lost her rights of divorce, inheritance, succession and their child's legal status. All matters of divorce, inheritance, succession, partition and guardianship of children were mostly decided by the foreign judge. It was unequitable and injustice to Buddhist women. To protect those matters of Buddhist woman who enter into contract to marry with non-Buddhist man, the Legislative Council passed that relating Act in 1939 Myanmar Law Act No.24 of 1939). The Act came into force on 1 April 1941 but it was unaffected because of the existence of the 2nd World war. The Myanmar Buddhist Women's Special Marriage and Succession Marriage Act, 1954 However, The Myanmar Buddhist Women's Special Marriage and Succession Marriage Act, 1939 was enacted by Legislative Council, it was unaffected. So, the position of non- Buddhist husband's Myanmar Buddhist wife was still very unfavorable to her. War and military occupation prevented the Act from coming into full play in Myanmar, and a new Act was drafted and passed in Myanmar language by Parliament in 1954. Certain improvement were also introduced into the Act to provide for the better interest of the Buddhist woman. According to The Buddhist Women's Special Marriage and Succession Act 1954, it determined to govern the marriage between Myanmar Buddhist and non-Buddhist man to safeguard the rights of Buddhist women's entitled under Myanmar Customary Law in the case of a marriage i.e. between Myanmar Buddhist. And proprietary rights, rights of inheritance, divorce, partition on Divorce and Guardianship of Children all are governed by Myanmar Customary Law. One of the most important question of law occurred regarding the status of wives to establish under the Act in the case of Mrs.Marry Wain vs. Daw Kyi Kyi6 is that U Htin Wain, Christian, having two wives, one wife a Christian and another wife a Buddhist living together over ten years as husbad and wife. In that case U Htin Wain and Mrs.Marry Wain are Christians married under the Christian Marriage Act. When U Htin Wain expired, Daw Kyi Kyi filed as suit that she is the legal wife of U Htin Wain and had a right to inherit together with the first wife, Mrs.Marry Wain. Mrs.Marry Wain contended that under the Christian Marriage Act, there is only a monogamous marriage tie subsisted, so that Daw Kyi Kyi has no right to inherit as a legal wife. But the Chief Court decided that Daw Kyi Kyi has the right to inherit together with Mrs.Marry Wain from the deceased U Htin Wain's property. According to Myanmar Customary Law, the share to be inherited by Daw Kyi Kyi is one-half of the \\"Lettetpwa\\" property during their marriage and one-third of the \\"Atetper\\" property during the marriage of U Hitn Wain and Mrs.Marry Wain. Thus, the status of wives of non-Buddhist husband under the 1954 Special Act was almost equaled footing among themselves. But, some of the wives of non-Buddhist husband was still very unfavorable because of the weakness of law. Myanmar Buddhist Women's Special Marriage Law, 2015 However Myanmar Buddhist Women's Special Marriage and Succession Act (1954) had affected, most of the Myanmar Buddhist Women did not know it.7They thought that if they married non-Buddhist man, they needed to change their husband religion. In that of doing so, they may be legal wife. So, a group of nationalist monk group called \\"The Association for the Protection of Race and Religion\\" and their followers demanded to protect Myanmar Buddhist Women. To give effective of legal protection for Myanmar Buddhist Women, PyiDaungSu Hluttaw passed this law in 2015. This law came into force on 26 August 2015. It was written for Myanmar Buddhist Women who marry man from other religions so they have equal rights in marriage, divorce, inheritance and taking care of children as well as have effective protection.

Roger Hilsman, later to become Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, was a veteran of the efforts to form partisan anti-Japanese resistance fighters among the various ethnic groups within Myanmar. Hilsman's experiences in these efforts instilled within him a penchant for guerrilla warfare, as well as for the importance of popular mobilization during counterinsurgency operations, both of which would influence his approach to the later Vietnam war.  Cold War  According to released documents from the National Security Archive, the United States continuously worried about communist influence in Myanmar during the Cold War. A main concern was over economic warfare. Since the country was a major exporter of rice, the United States worried that communist control of Myanmar could result in manipulation of price and distribution of Myanmar rice to the detriment of nearby United States allies, such as India, Ceylon, Malaysia, and Japan.Jeffrey T. Richelson, The Soviet Estimate: U.S. Analysis of the Soviet Union, 1947-91 (Washington, D.C.: The National Security Archive, 1995), SE 00081, ‚ÄúThe Communist Influence in Burma,‚Äù January 11th 1950, pp. 5-6. = Kuomintang in Myanmar = Lieutenant General Li Mi, a Chinese nationalist general but, in reality, Commander of the large Anti-Communist National Salvation Army guerrilla force. At the close of the Korean War, one of the final operational theaters involving the CIA was in northern Myanmar. This operation was a strategic attempt to diminish attacks against General MacArthur's forces in the north. Li Mi, a Chinese nationalist general, had roughly 1500 soldiers trapped in northern Myanmar. The CIA trained nationalist Chinese soldiers in Thailand, armed them, and dropped them into northern Myanmar. Maoist forces awaited them, easily slaughtering many of them, thanks to a communist informant in Bangkok. CIA officer Desmond Fitzgerald attempted to correct the situation by dropping more weapons and ammunition into the area. The soldiers, however, refused to fight, and instead settled in the area, growing poppies, and intermarrying with locals. This blunder by the CIA resulted in Li Mi running a major heroin operation, which the CIA saw fit to eradicate twenty years later.Tim Weiner. (2008). Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA. New York: Anchor Books. pages 60-61. In 1952, in an effort to bolster Li Mi's forces, 700 men were airlifted from Taiwan. Over the course of 1952 and 1953, flights carrying weapons and ammunition arrived in Mong Hsat in the Shan State of Myanmar on nearly a daily basis. Several tons of medical supplies and communication equipment were flown in as well. General Li Mi reported that such numbers were exaggerated, however, suggesting that there had only been 20 deliveries to Mong Hsat in 1952, and that each plane could only carry ten people and one ton of payload.Jovan ƒåavo≈°ki.

Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. =Chemical Weapons Allegations= A CIA document from 1988 suggests that Burma had a small chemical weapons production facility, supposedly built with the help of West Germany in the early 1980s. The document claims that the facility had produced mustard gas in the past, but had ceased production. The document also goes on to state that ethnic insurgents in Burma have claimed that the Army was importing chemical weapons from China, but the CIA was unable to verify such claims.http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb423/docs/11.%20special%20weapons.pdf Post-Cold War On 10 September 2007, the Myanmar government accused the CIA of assassinating a rebel Karen commander from the Karen National Union who wanted to negotiate with the military government. According to media reports citing documents published by Germany's Der Spiegel in 2010, the Embassy of the United States in Yangon is the site of an electronic surveillance facility used to monitor telephones and communications networks. The facility is run jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) through a group known as Special Collection Service. In 2011 the Guardian newspaper published WikiLeaks cable information regarding Myanmar. The cables revealed that the US funded some of the civil society groups in Myanmar that forced the government to suspend the controversial Chinese Myitsone Dam on the Irrawaddy river.

Route, geography and landscapes  The endless widths in Vojvodina The railway line between Budapest and Belgrade passes mainly the B√°cs-Kiskun County and the Serbian Province of Vojvodina. The landscape is characterised by countless fields, dead straight highways and endless widths.  Track condition, modernization  The outdated railway between Belgrade and Budapest will be modernised. The travel time should be decreased from eight hours to three and a half hours, and the maximum speed of the track is designed to be . Train speed will be however limited to 160 km/h, due to signalling, so the line will not be high-speed at all.

The section Stara Pazova-Novi Sad is being reconstructed by the Russian RZD International, financed with Russian credit. The reconstruction of the section Novi Sad-Subotica is set to begin in 2019, with estimated cost of ‚Ç¨943 million, built by CCCC and a duration of 33 months, during which this section will be closed.  Criticism  In Hungary, the project is criticized for its unclear economic viability, debt to China, the fact that this is the most expensive infrastructure investment in the country's recent history, the proposed trajectory, and possible corruption. While the Hungarian government classified its analysis for the economic viability of the project for 10 years, estimates in the non-government-owned media estimate the return around 130 to 2400 years based on the current and expected traffic on the line. The track avoids all major Hungarian cities after Budapest, while an alternative route via Kecskem√©t and Szeged would benefit a ten-times bigger population. Only two consortia bid for the work.

Lord Shiva (popularly known as Puttur Mahalingeshwara) is the main deity. Legend The most common story for the creation of the temple is that in the past, three old and learned Smartha-cult Sthanika Brahmins were travelling through southern India, Worshipping a Shiva Linga that they got from the Hindu holy ‚ÄòKshetra of Kashi‚Äô. The three were ardent devotees of Shiva. One day they arrived at a place called ‚ÄòGayapada Kshetra‚Äô now known as Uppinangady in Puttur Taluk, Dakshina Kannada. At Uppinangady, one of the three decided to move towards Puttur leaving behind the other two. He reached Puttur one evening, carrying the ‚ÄòShiva Ling‚Äô with him. He got up early the next morning and after a holy bath went to the palace of the Banga King to collect flowers and other essential poojaTamarapu Sampath Kumaran. \\"Pilgrimage to Temples in Dakshina Kannada\\" (PDF). Retrieved 22 February 2015. materials for the worship of Shiva. That day was a Monday, which was considered auspicious for the worship of Lord Shiva. At that time the Banga King did not pay attention to the arrival of this Brahmin, as he was much worried about the labor-pain of his loving sister. However, the minister of the Banga-King, looking at the Divine Brightness in the face of the Brahmin, made an appeal regarding the King's problem. The Brahmin worshipped the Linga and blessed the King's sister assuring him that she would safely deliver a baby boy. Later to the astonishment of all, she gave birth to a boy child. The King felt happy over the event and thanked the Brahmin and arranged for the worship of the Lord. Later on that particular day, the Brahmin, knowingly or otherwise, kept the Shiva-Linga on the ground without a stand or seat and worshiped it. After the pooja, he lifted the Linga from the ground, in order to keep it again in the container box (samputa), but it could not be lifted from the ground. The Brahmin used all his force to lift the Linga, but all efforts were in vain. The linga remained in place. The King's army men applied force unsuccessfully. The King's elephant was summoned to lift the linga. As the elephant struggled, the linga grew to huge size and became Mahalinga, shattering the elephant into pieces. The animals' body parts spread out in different direction. The place where its horn (Khombu) fell came to be called ‚ÄòKombettu‚Äô, Kari fell ‚ÄòKariyala, legs fell (kalu) ‚ÄòKarjala‚Äô, hand(Kai) fell ‚ÄòKaipala‚Äô tail fell ‚ÄòBeedimajalu‚Äô, head(Tale) fell ‚ÄòTaleppady‚Äô and back (Beri) fell ‚Äò Beripadavu‚Äô. These place names survived in the surroundings of Puttur. And since the elephant fell dead into the temple tank, a strong belief grew that elephants cannot survive drinking the tank water.

He made major, multifaceted contributions to the creation and development of the State of Israel, related primarily to the facilitation of the construction and import of Uzi submachine guns into then British-Mandated Palestine. He played a central role in the founding of the Weizmann Institute of Science; he provided initiatives for the practical application of science research there, and was a pioneer of a science-based industrial complex in Rehovot, adjacent to the Weizmann Institute, which was the first of its kind in Israel. A man of great reserve throughout his career, Levine disclaimed public acclaim for his contributions and avoided public disclosure of them during his lifetime. Personal life Harry Levine was born on August 1, 1895 in New York City to Samuel and Sarah Levine. He was educated in the public schools of New York and at the College of the City of New York. He married his first wife, Hannah, in 1919; she died in 1941. He had three children with Hannah: Irwin (killed in World War II), Morton and Barbara, and had six grandchildren. He married his second wife, Leona, in 1942. Levine served in the U.S. Navy during World War I, working on a minelayer ship in the North Sea. Levine was elected President of New England Plastics and Commonwealth Plastic in 1946, as well as President and Chairman of the Board of the U.S. Plastic and Chemical Company in 1952. In 1949, he founded the Serafon Plastics Company in Rehovot, Israel. He died on May 1, 1977, at age 82. Zionism Levine was introduced to Zionism in 1935 by Elihu D. Stone of Boston. Once pledged, Levine felt it was his responsibility to act on the tenets of Zionism, no matter what the sacrifice. This concept of duty expressed itself in a singular and dramatic role; providing the means for self-defense through underground networks for both Palestine, prior to statehood, and Israel, following statehood. Levine was a member of the original group of thirteen who, years before Jewish statehood, grasped Dr. Chaim Weizmann‚Äôs vision of the potential for science to grow the resources of Palestine. They gave to science research pioneering support and formed the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science. The Weizmann Institute of Science emerged to take its place as a principal instrument for the advancement of human progress, and as a cornerstone of Israel‚Äôs survival and development. Harry and his wife Leona donated the Institute of Applied Science as a feature of the Weizmann Institute to be a platform for scientists to develop their results of fundamental research in different branches of science. As early as 1945, Levine financed research at Harvard University on the purification of brackish water in the Negev, a desert in Southern Israel. His gifts to the Weizmann Institute include, in addition, a $1 million pledge to expand the Harry and Leona Levine Institute of Applied Science, to make possible mission oriented research; endowment of the Abba Eban Professorial Chair in international relations in 1966, and two mathematics prizes in 1970, each at $1,000, to encourage studies in the field. Levine felt that the Weizmann Institute could be a showcase for the world to see what dedicated scientists are capable of, not just for Israel, but for all of humanity. He stated that \\"because Israel has limited natural resources, it must depend on brain power, and brain power reflected in science research and applied sciences will go a long way in developing the economy of the country. The know-how of the Weizmann Institute could be applied with equal effectiveness to the Mideast region, once there is peace with Israel's Arab neighbors.\\"  Camp Young Judaea  Levine was introduced to Justice Louis D. Brandeis by Dr. Shlomo Berdin. Brandeis commissioned Levine to organize youth activities throughout the New England area, and to start a summer camp with the program, directed by the national headquarters of the Zionist Organization of America. The then-called Zionist Youth Camp began on 165 acres at Mont Vernon, New Hampshire in 1939. Starting with 50 children, from ages 8 to 15, the camp now runs programs for Jewish youth in grade 2-12. It is the oldest Zionist youth camp in the United States. Contribution to Armaments Factory In 1942, Jewish leadership had determined to seek Jewish Statehood in Palestine at the end of the war. That resolve was fortified by the full disclosure of the decimation of European Jewry by Adolf Hitler, and by the refusal of the British to permit the survivors to enter Palestine. Levine's specific task was to secure the design of a powerful, versatile automatic weapon; the assembly of the machinery for making it; and the smuggling of this machinery into Palestine. Later, the task also included plans for making ammunition for the gun and the acquisition of war surplus materials. Levine was, presumably, selected for the task because of his industrial knowledge and connections, as someone who had been in the Navy and worked in the plastics and chemical industry for most of his adult life. Levine bought the York Lock & Key Company in 1942 or 1943 and sold the interest after World War II. During the war, York Lock & Key manufactured weapons; much of the whole plant was turned over for the war effort. In 1945, Chaim Slavin visited the United States and arranged a visit to Levine's office. Slavin was an engineer from Russia who worked with Pinhas Rutenberg on building a power station at Naharayim, and managed the clandestine arms industry Ta'as in Mandatory Palestine from 1937-1952. Slavin was sent to meet with Levine as a representative of a group of Zionists working to establish Israel as a state, and as a collective they decided that Jews in Palestine should set up their own plant for producing guns and ammunition, including the Thompson machine gun. Levine and Slavin met in Levine's plastics factory where Slavin proposed this important project and requested Levine's involvement. At that point, all weaponry was purchased in Europe for three or four times the price than the actual value. Slavin needed blueprints for the machine gun and requested Levine's aid in acquiring them as soon as possible. It was a dangerous endeavor as they couldn't get the blueprint without explaining why they needed it, thus revealing the plan to arm Jews in Palestine. Slavin and Levine had trouble finding a location in the United States where they could develop a plant to make weapons and acquiring the necessary tools, jigs and fixtures. Levine and Slavin eventually found a cooperating factory and rented space; they did not inform the property owner of details, they only said they were using the space to do research in connection with the Weizmann Institute. Slavin, Levine and their team set up an engineering department, made individual blueprints of component pieces of the weapon, and distributed those to approximately 20 machine shops in Toronto to ensure that the project remained a secret. In 1947, the FBI became interested in the operation and the Royal Canadians filed to extradite Levine, as the plant in Canada was under his name. As a result, Levine was persona non grata in Canada and wasn't permitted to enter Canada for at least 10 years. At that point, some of the machine components had been sent to Levine's plastics warehouse in the Bronx. From there, Slavin and Levine bought boilers, took the tubes out and filled them with all of the tools, jigs and fixtures so that it appeared that they were shipping over boilers. They had a proper export license and were connected to a factory in Palestine that had the import license, and they clandestinely shipped the boilers. The boilers got through to Palestine and were placed in underground plants. Workers in the machine shops began working on the tools, jigs and fixtures and then began to buy machinery and producing weapons. Leonard Slater, the man who conducted an interview with Levine regarding his role in the American underground movement that helped arm the unborn state of Israel for its war of independence, used the interview in his book The Pledge in 1971. The Pledge, made up of first-hand correspondence and interviews, is a narrative of a little-known subplot to the story of the state of Israel's birth. Legacy Harry Levine understood early on that a primary prerequisite of modern and viable statehood is basic and all-encompassing applied scientific research, which allows a society to be able to anticipate and serve the country's economic and industrial needs at all times and on many levels. The achievements of the Weizmann Institute are world-renowned. As of 2016, there are 238 research groups, 172 staff scientists, 700 PhD students, 300 MS students, 380 postdoctoral fellows, $100M in research grants for scientific investigations, and 1,000 active grants. Further, Levine's role in the development of armaments factories in Israel prior to established statehood quietly contributed to a well-established paramilitary organization known as the Haganah, which became the core of the Israel Defense Forces. Haganah was initially a clandestine paramilitary organization; after 'having gotten the Jews of Palestine and of elsewhere to do everything that they could, personally and financially, to help Yishuv,' Ben-Gurion successfully transformed the Haganah into a true army. The IDF uses weapons manufactured by Israel Military Industries (IMI), previously referred to as Ta'as before statehood; their small arms are some of the most popular in the world. The Uzi submachine gun is one of the most popular machine guns in the world. The reliance on locally manufactured military equipment has also greatly increased. Today, the overwhelming majority of Israel's military equipment is either manufactured in the United States (and often modified in Israeli workshops), or is developed and manufactured locally, with an increasing emphasis on advanced technology, including aerospace and electronics. Ultimately, Levine ran a risk by participating in the development of armaments factories in Palestine as a highly respected business man. He felt it was his duty, regardless of the outcome, to help protect the small number of Jews in Palestine prior to statehood in the name of Zionism: moving to build a safe, national home, and protecting it.

As of 2015, there were 474,777 licensed professional engineers in the U.S. The first Professional Engineers Day was celebrated on August 3, 2016.  History  The idea for Professional Engineers Day came from Tim Austin, PE, a professional engineer from Kansas who served as president of the National Society of Professional Engineers in 2015‚Äì16. While promotion of engineering in the US is common, such as the attention given to STEM fields and events such as the USA Science and Engineering Festival and National Engineers Week (U.S.), which was also founded by NSPE in 1951, Austin believed attention should be paid specifically to the contributions of licensed professional engineers because of NSPE's core principle which states, \\"Being a licensed professional engineer means more than just holding a certificate and possessing technical competence. It is a commitment to hold the public health, safety, and welfare above all other considerations.\\" Of course, an idea is just an idea unless actions are taken to turn that idea into something tangible. Led by then Executive Director, Mark J. Golden, CAE, Communications Director David Siegel, and Public Relation & Outreach Manager Stacey Ober, the NSPE staff created the celebratory event known today as PE Day, which is mostly a virtual event across social media platforms. The success of PE Day and the efforts of NSPE staff was recognized by the Association of Media & Publishing in the category \\"Promotional Content: Social Media Campaign\\" in June 2018 Licensing of professional engineers in the US began in 1907, when Clarence Johnston, the state engineer of Wyoming, presented a bill to the Wyoming legislature that would require registration for those representing themselves to the public as an engineer or land surveyor. The bill was later enacted, making the state the first in the US to register engineers and land surveyors. On August 8, 1907, Charles Bellamy of Wyoming received the first professional engineering license. Professional Engineers Day is held the first Wednesday in August to mark that occasion. Incidentally, Bellamy's wife, Mary Godot Bellamy, is also known for a first: the first woman elected to the Wyoming legislature. Charles Bellamy founded Bellamy & Sons Engineers in 1913. The Bellamy Chapter of the Wyoming Society of Professional Engineers is named in his honor. Today, for the purpose of protecting the public, all US states and territories license professional engineers. Professional Engineers make contributions in virtually all areas of society, industry, and economy including, among other things, energy, transportation, manufacturing, communications, environment, mining, building, defense, education, medical, and consumer products.

Its primary attraction is a limestone cave with a pool of blue water and unusual cave formations. These have suffered from vandalism, causing the cave to be closed until measures to protect it could be implemented. Location The Gruta da Lagoa Azul State Park is in the municipality of Nobres, Mato Grosso. It has an area of . The blue lagoon cave holds a pool of blue water formed from underground water of the Saloba River. The main entrance is filled in part by the water. The hall contains columns over in size and in diameter. There may be archaeological remains in the cave. The park has several other limestone caves. It is covered with deciduous forests, and is home to howler monkeys, tapirs, jaguars and macaws. History The Gruta da Lagoa Azul State Park was created by decree 1.472 of 13 December 1999 with an area of about , including the former Gruta Lagoa Azul Reserve. On 30 May 1999 an ordinance prohibited public visits until a management plan had been prepared for the purpose of preserving the cave while allowing tourism. Law 7.369 of 20 December 2000 confirmed the decree creating the park. The Speleological Management Plan for the cave was approved on 10 February 2014. The consultative council was created on 15 December 2014. Threats The main threat comes from damage by tourists and local agriculture. The cave has a very fragile ecosystem, dependent on constant temperature and humidity. Increased CO2 from the visitors' breath and heat from their lights can encourage fungus and lichens to attack the speleothems. Damage includes broken speleothems, carvings and writing on the walls. Local residents are aware that the cave has been quite badly vandalised, and that it is a valuable tourist attraction. They were in favour of closing the cave until a plan could be prepared to prevent further management.

Built on a site starting in 1979, it is the largest steel mill in Nigeria, and the coke oven and byproducts plant are larger than all the refineries in Nigeria combined. However, the project was mismanaged and remains incomplete 40 years later. Three-quarters of the complex have been abandoned, and only the light mills have been put into operation for small-scale fabrication and the production of iron rods.  History  The construction project was first awarded to the British, and later undertaken by the Soviet Union under a cooperation agreement with Nigeria. In 1967, Soviet experts recommended prospecting for iron ore in Nigeria, as the known deposits were of poor quality for steelmaking. In 1973, iron ore of the required quality was discovered in Itakpe, Ajabanoko, and Oshokoshoko. The Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited was incorporated in 1979, and the steel mill reached 98% completion in 1994, with 40 of the 43 plants at the facility having been built. To supply the Ajaokuta Steel Mill with raw materials and connect it with the world market, a contract was awarded in 1987 for the construction of Nigeria's first standard gauge railway, from the iron mines at Itakpe to the steel mill at Ajaokuta and continuing to the Atlantic Ocean at Warri. However, both projects have been mismanaged. The Ajaokuta Steel Mill was still unfinished four decades after construction began. After several failed attempts at privatisation, the Nigerian government took back control in 2016. The Ajaokuta Steel Mill still had not produced a single sheet of steel by December 2017. The light mills were finally put into operation in 2018 for small-scale fabrication and the production of iron rods. However, three-quarters of the plant have been abandoned, including the large-scale equipment and the internal railway. The Itakpe‚ÄìWarri Railway fell into disrepair, and part of the track was vandalised. In 2016, the Nigerian government awarded contracts to the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation and Julius Berger to repair and complete the railway. Test runs began in November 2018, and the railway is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.

Traub (born April 6, 1945) is an American photographer and educator, known for his ironic real world witness color photography. He was chair of the photography department at Columbia College Chicago, where he established its Museum of Contemporary Photography (MOCP) in 1976, and became a director of New York's Light Gallery in 1977. Traub founded the MFA program in Photography, Video, and Related Media at the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 1987, which was the first program of its kind to fully embrace digital photographic practice. He has been Chairperson of the program since. Traub has published many books of his photographs and writings on photography and media. Early life and education Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, Traub earned his BA in English literature at the University of Illinois, where both his mother and father had also attended. In 1967, during his last semester of his senior year in college, he took his first photography class with the landscape photographer Art Sinsabaugh using the camera left to him by his recently deceased father. His family roots in both central Illinois and Kentucky gave inspiration for his early photographic work. After college, Traub joined the Peace Corps in Ethiopia. He married a fellow Peace Corps member, who died shortly after arriving in Ethiopia. Traub himself was injured and returned home where he met fellow Kentuckian, Ralph Eugene Meatyard, who became an important inspiration and friend. Although he enrolled in a graduate program in humanities at the University of Louisville, he was drafted into the United States Army as an infantryman but was subsequently discharged for medical reasons incurred during his time with the Peace Corps. After service in the United States Army in 1969, Traub decided to pursue photography at the Chicago Institute of Design. There he earned his Master of Science studying under Aaron Siskind, Arthur Siegel and Garry Winogrand. During this time, he began to experiment with different formats and processes in his landscape photographs of Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois. He has said \\"You probably recognize the similar sentiment that exists in all of those earlier pictures; they all share a certain kind of Southern Gothic, dark, and maudlin sensibility.\\" His thesis of haunting, abstracted black-and-white positive and negative landscapes, \\"Edge to Edge\\", was widely exhibited, and featured in a solo show at the Art Institute of Chicago (1975). Career Following his landscape work Charles Traub made three well-known series of black-and-white photographs: Street, Parties, and his first monograph, Beach, all used an innovative vignette on a Rolleiflex SL66. In 1971 Traub began teaching full- time at Columbia College Chicago, and was responsible of developing new curriculum for the growing public interest in the medium. He was instrumental in developing the school's Contemporary Trends Lecture Series that celebrated renowned international photographers and image-makers. Subsequently, he became chairperson of the department and founded the Chicago Center for Contemporary Photography, which became the Museum of Contemporary Photography (MOCP). In 1973, along with his colleague Douglas Baz, Traub went on a sabbatical to make the Cajun Document, extensive look at the culture of the Louisiana bayous. Traub's first major body of work in color, Street Portraits, began in 1976, continued after his move to New York City shortly thereafter, and culminated in his monograph Lunchtime. His move to New York was followed by his first solo exhibition of photographs at the Light Gallery. Its owner, Tennyson Schad, then hired Traub to become director of this prestigious gallery. Traub curated numerous exhibitions there, including The New Vision: Forty Years of Photography at the Institute of Design; Aaron Siskind's Harlem Document; Designed for Photography; and The Color Work of the FSA. Traub also showcased major photographers new to the gallery: William Klein, Luigi Ghirri, Ray Metzker, Mario Giacomelli and Louis Faurer among others. During this time, he attempted to connect the communities of photographers and artists working in other media. After leaving the gallery in 1980 he continued his personal work and formed the Wayfarer partnership with Jerry Gordon‚Äîa specialized editorial and corporate photography agency. Their work was featured in many magazines, including Life, Time, Forbes, Fortune, Business Week, New York and Avenue as well as annual reports for Fortune 500 companies. Throughout the 1980s Traub traveled to Italy, Brazil, Haiti, Morocco and the Far East for his personal work. Dolce Via and In the Still Life are compendiums of photographs from that period. In 1987 Traub was asked to design a graduate studies program for the School of Visual Arts, which became the MFA Photography, Video and Related Media Department. Since its inception, the program has been distinguished for its innovative use of digital technology, the inclusion of all aspects of the lens and screen arts and its internationally celebrated faculty. As an early advocate of the power of digital photography, Traub adapted it to his own practice. His philosophy about the importance of digital thinking is reflected in the manifesto Creative Interlocutor and the textbook In the Realm of the Circuit. Creative projects that highlight Traub's integration of new technologies include the interactive website Still Life in America and the iBook No Perfect Heroes: Photographing Grant. Here is new york: a democracy of photographs was co-founded by Traub and three others. This living memorial to the tragedy of 9/11 received the Brendan Gill Award as well as the ICP Cornell Capa Infinity Award. It is considered one of the seminal examples of crowdsourcing, digital production and online distribution of universally produced imagery. The exhibition traveled to 42 venues worldwide, and with its Web presence is considered to be one of the most widely viewed exhibitions of all time. Traub has dedicated himself to photographic education, and has been a chairperson at the School of Visual Arts for 30 years. He has served on a number of non-profit educational boards, and is the president of the Aaron Siskind Foundation. He has had more than 60 major exhibitions in galleries and museums throughout the world, including one-person shows at the Art Institute of Chicago, The Speed Museum, Hudson River Museum and Historic New Orleans Collection. Traub's work is in the permanent collections of more than two dozen major museums worldwide.

The series comprises 18 \\"chapters\\" that document individual bloodlines. The chapters are investigations of fate, blood, psychological inheritance and what the artist refers to as \\"a relentless persistence of birth and death, and an endless collection of stories in between.\\"  Background  Each \\"chapter\\" has three parts: image, text, and footnotes. The first part is composed of a rigorous system of images in which the subject, their ascendants, and descendants are photographed after being interviewed on a plain, off-white background, stripped from any cultural context. The images are then placed in rows alongside one another in a chronological order to represent the bloodline. Some of the subjects were not able to attend the shoot because of military service, dengue fever, a conflicting event, and women not being able to be photographed for religious or cultural reasons. In these cases, Simon leaves the space blank to represent a \\"gap\\" in the bloodline. The second part is the text, a panel composed of Simon's research about the bloodline she is documenting. The final part is what Simon calls \\"footnotes\\". Unlike the first part, these images do not have an orderly system of representation, and are presented in a more rhizomatic structure with the intention of representing information similarly to how it would be obtained in the digital age. The work incorporates elements of photography, text, design, and sculpture. A Living Man Declared Dead And Other Chapters, I ‚Äì XVIII was exhibited in Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, Germany (2011), Tate Modern in London, England (2011), The Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, California (2012), Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York (2012), Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (2013), The Pavilion Downtown, Dubai, United Arab Emirates (2013), Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, China (2013), and Le Point du Jour, Cherbourg, France (2015).  Chapter I  The title of the exhibition A Living Man Declared Dead is derived from Chapter I, in which Simon documents the bloodline of Shivdutt Yadav. Yadav, his two brothers, and his cousin were declared dead by state officials in Uttar Pradesh, India. The documents are a result of bribery in which city officials accept money in exchange for official death documents that result in the inheritance of hereditary land.  Chapter II  The subject of Chapter II is the bloodline of Arthur Ruppin, an official sent by the Zionist Organization to study the Jewish community in Palestine in the early 1900s, and to scope out potential for Jewish settlements. In 1908, he moved to Palestine where he was delegated the task of acquiring new land and developing urban and rural autonomous Jewish settlements which were financed by Zionists. Ruppin's actions are seen as fundamental in the inauguration of the State of Israel.  Chapter V  As part of Chapter V, Simon worked to document the bloodline of South Korean Choe Jangguen. Choe was an engineer aboard the ship Tongyeong in 1977 when captured amidst a conflict with the North Korean armed forces. Choe is one of the 500+ reported South Koreans abducted by North Korea after the Korean war who remain against their consent. In the footnotes of this chapter Simon photographed a VHS tape of Pulgasari, a film produced by director Shin Sang-ok, later captured by North Korea in order to utilize his film-making talents to improve the film industry in North Korea. The footnotes also include Megumi, a graphic novel about the abduction of Megumi Yokota, as a photograph of Tongyeong Port, where Cheo Jangguen was last seen leaving for a mission, as well as Choe's identity documents and photographs of his ship returning after his abduction by North Korean armed forces. In 2013‚Äì2014, A Living Man Declared Dead series was exhibited at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. Exhibition of the text panels for Chapter V was not allowed. In response, Simon exhibited the censored panels as black bars at Ullens alongside the rest of the exhibition. This rendition of Chapter V proposed a dialogue of censorship and political allegiances newly a part of the exhibition. The censored rendition of Chapter V entered the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2013.  Chapter XV  In Chapter XV, Simon asked the State Council Information Office (SCIO) of the People's Republic of China in 2009 to choose a family to represent China. The SCIO selected the Su Qijian bloodline, a middle-class family from Beijing, with no particular reasoning provided. This chapter is one of the few of the series in which all members of the family were present for the photography shoot. In the footnotes Simon photographed a media tower, which was a request of SCIO, as well as a gift bag provided by SCIO. The text panel describes SCIO's role in circulating both internal and external media regarding Chinese national affairs. The bloodline of Chapter XV demonstrates the evolution of the one-child policy, which was adopted by China between 1978 and 1980. The chapter was also acquired by the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2013.

Plot The first part follows K√°ƒçko during his criminal career in the Czech Republic. K√°ƒçko is a gangster in Ostrava who is known for that he doesn't kill his rivals but has them shot in the leg. He decides that Ostrava is too small for him and departs to Prague. The Prague criminal world is dominated by Milota and Siv√°k. K√°ƒçko starts a business with them and steals them 260 million crowns as a result. Milota decides to not take revenge yet. K√°ƒçko then gains more influence and earns millions of crowns during variable frauds and plans to overtake the ƒåepro company, which owns all fuel resources in the country. This plan fails when he is betrayed by one of his associates. K√°ƒçko is arrested and taken in custody awaiting trial. Milota and Siv√°k use it to revenge and try to steal money from his accounts. This fails because K√°ƒçko gave pin codes to his father and account numbers to his pregnant wife Sandra. K√°ƒçko's father dies during torture but doesn't give those codes. Sandra who was abducted by Siv√°k is then released but loses the baby as a result an abduction. K√°ƒçko is released from custody thanks to a murder of an investigator and thanks to his lawyer. He leaves the prison as a different person and decides for revenge against Milota. He decides to spare Siv√°k because he was just obeying Milota's orders. K√°ƒçko gives Siv√°k a list of people he is supposed to murder. Siv√°k kill people on the list one by one and gains a nickname \\"Butcher\\". Klein meanwhile tries to negotiate more money from K√°ƒçko but K√°ƒçko slaps him and threatens to destroy him if he doesn't obey. Klein is scared and asks Milota for help. Milota has materials that can be used as evidence of K√°ƒçko's crimes. He gives the material to L√°nsk√Ω an investigator who wants to get K√°ƒçko behind bars. Police raids K√°ƒçko's mansion and arrest him but K√°ƒçko escapes when he asks for toilet. K√°ƒçko then flees from the Czech Republic. Milota is meanwhile murdered on Klein's orders. =African= K√°ƒçko escapes to Seychelles where he only drinks and lies on a Sunshine. Meanwhile, Siv√°k takes over Milota's business and starts to work with Klein. Klein wants to get K√°ƒçko back to the Czech Republic because K√°ƒçko has evidence that can compromise Klein. L√°nsk√Ω starts to investigate Klein but his wife is killed in a murder attempt ordered by Klein which devastates him. L√°nsk√Ω starts reopening his investigation of K√°ƒçko. K√°ƒçko at the time \\"sobered up\\" and made money on selling imported Toilet Paper in Seychelles. K√°ƒçko becomes influential in Seychellois politics and helps local politician Dr. Martier during his campaign with hope of getting Seychellois citizenship. L√°nsk√Ω organizes another plan to take down K√°ƒçko and puts agents on him. Agents are later revealed and K√°ƒçko angrily reveals his association with Klein to media which leads to fall of government. K√°ƒçko then moves to South Africa because his friend Darda starts to work with L√°nsk√Ω. K√°ƒçko gains a fugitive status in South Africa and creates connections in South African crime world. He forms a business partnership with local mob boss Uncle Cyril. K√°ƒçko later murders Cyril and takes over his place. K√°ƒçko becomes the most powerful mobster in South Africa but starts to have problem with public and is threatened by possible loss of fugitive status which would lead to his extradition to the Czech Republic. K√°ƒçko decides to sell drugs which is against his principles. His plan to sell drugs in Australia fail when his associate John Greengrass betrays him and drugs are stolen by Pakistani mafia. K√°ƒçko then leads group of criminals in Pakistani quarter with intention to get drugs back. It results in shootout and Dardan is shot and dies which strucks K√°ƒçko. K√°ƒçko is arrested when L√°nsk√Ω gets a map that marks graves of Kraviec's victims.

It is \\"a framework for describing the nuclear many-body problem as a relativistic system of baryons and mesons\\". Quantum hadrodynamics is closely related and partly derived from quantum chromodynamics, which is the theory of interactions between quarks and gluons that bind them together to form hadrons, via the strong force. An important phenomenon in quantum hadrodynamics is the nuclear force, or residual strong force. It is the force operating between those hadrons which are nucleons ‚Äì protons and neutrons ‚Äì as it binds them together to form the atomic nucleus. The bosons which mediate the nuclear force are three types of mesons: pions, rho mesons and omega mesons. Since mesons are themselves hadrons, quantum hadrodynamics also deals with the interaction between the carriers of the nuclear force itself, alongside the nucleons bound by it. The hadrodynamic force keeps nuclei bound, against the electrodynamic force which operates to break them apart (due to the mutual repulsion between protons in the nucleus). Quantum hadrodynamics, dealing with the nuclear force and its mediating mesons, can be compared to other quantum field theories which describe fundamental forces and their associated bosons: quantum chromodynamics, dealing with the strong interaction and gluons; quantum electrodynamics, dealing with electromagnetism and photons; quantum flavordynamics, dealing with the weak interaction and W and Z bosons.

It aims to minimize environmental harm by comparing multiple potential solutions in the context of a specific problem, design goal, or policy objective. It is intended to inform decision-making in situations with many possible courses of action, a wide range of variables to consider, and significant degrees of uncertainty. Alternatives assessment was originally developed as a robust way to guide precautionary action and avoid paralysis by analysis; authors such as O'Brien have presented alternatives assessment as an approach that is complementary to risk assessment, the dominant decision-making approach in environmental policy. Likewise, Ashford has described the similar concept of technology options analysis as a way to generate innovative solutions to the problems of industrial pollution more effectively than through risk-based regulation. Alternatives assessment is practiced in a variety of settings, including but not limited to green chemistry, sustainable design, supply-chain chemicals management, and chemicals policy. One prominent application area for alternatives assessment is the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, also known as chemical alternatives assessment.  Methodology  Generally, alternatives assessment involves considering a number of possible options to achieve a specific objective, and applying a principled comparative analysis. The objective is usually to improve the environmental performance or safety of a specific product, material, process, or other activity. Potential alternatives considered in the analysis may include different chemical substances, materials, technologies, methods of use, or even extensive redesign to enable new ways of achieving the objective while avoiding the problem. Understanding the consequences of each available option is central to the process and goals of alternatives assessment, because this helps avoid decisions that substitute one problem with another (unknown) problem. The comparative analysis can involve any number of criteria for evaluating options, and these are typically focused on environmental health and sustainability. There is no single protocol that dictates how options should be identified, evaluated, and compared in an alternatives assessment. Rather, a number of different alternatives assessment frameworks exist, which serve to structure decision-making and to enable systematic consideration of the key factors. Jacobs and colleagues identify six major components of alternatives assessment: evaluation of hazard, exposure, life cycle impacts, technical feasibility, and economic feasibility; and an overall decision- making strategy. One major framework, the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production Alternatives Assessment Framework, conceives of alternatives assessment very broadly, as a reflexive problem-solving process that recognizes the social and technical complexity of environmental problems. It emphasizes aspects such as stakeholder participation, transparency of the process, and open discussion of values in decision-making. Most other frameworks are more narrow and primarily focused on technical aspects. = Chemical alternatives assessment = Chemical alternatives assessment (or substitution of hazardous chemicals) is the use of alternatives assessment for finding safer and environmentally preferable design options to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances. Safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals may simply be other chemical substances, or may involve deeper changes in material or product design. Chemical alternatives assessment aims to provide the basis for well-informed decision-making by thoroughly characterizing chemicals and materials (and other design options) across a wide range of environmental and health impact categories. The rationale for this is to avoid shifting environmental health burdens from one category of impacts to another (e.g., substituting a carcinogenic chemical with a neurotoxic one), and to minimize the unintended consequences of decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and ignorance‚Äîin other words, to prevent \\"regrettable substitutions\\", where an alternative appeared better based on limited knowledge, but turned out to be worse or equally bad. An array of methodologies and tools for chemical alternatives assessment have been developed worldwide and have been deployed in a variety of industry sectors. Chemical alternatives assessment frameworks include chemical hazard assessment methods that consider a wide range of hazard endpoints, such as those defined in the Globally Harmonized System or the GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals. = Examples = * The Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute has conducted alternatives assessments for the substitution of hazardous substances like lead and formaldehyde. * The San Francisco Department of Environment has conducted alternatives assessments to identify environmentally and economically preferable alternatives to conventional dry cleaning technology. * Electronics manufacturer Hewlett-Packard uses the GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals chemical hazard assessment method in product R&D.;  Practice of alternatives assessment  Scientists from a variety of government agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and firms have contributed to developing the practice of alternatives assessment. = In the United States = Scientific research in the US federal government has contributed to alternatives assessment frameworks and practices. In 2014 the US National Research Council released a chemical alternatives assessment framework developed by an expert working group. Prior to this, the US Environmental Protection Agency ran a program called Design for the Environment (now called Safer Choice), which developed chemical alternatives assessment methodology and created partnerships to undertake numerous alternatives assessments for chemicals of concern in products. Alternatives assessment has featured in some state-level chemicals policies and regulatory activities. The Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute has provided public technical assistance for \\"toxics use reduction planning\\", which includes alternatives assessment. More recently, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control is implementing new regulations that require firms to undertake alternatives assessments for selected priority chemicals in products. The Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse, an association of state governments, has also produced its own guide to alternatives assessment. Some US-based companies have begun to use chemical alternatives assessment to address chemical safety issues in supply chains. For example, firms that participate in the Business- NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials have produced their own guidance for chemical alternatives assessment. = In the European Union = The Sweden-based non-governmental organization ChemSec has been active in developing resources and tools for the substitution of hazardous chemicals.

It opened in 1978. EOYDC works to develop the social and leadership capacities of youth and young adults (ages 5 to 24) to prepare them for employment, higher education, and leadership. EOYDC describes itself as a community-based solution for solving social injustice and inequality, and a national model for youth development.  History  EOYDC was founded in 1973 and opened its doors in 1978 by Robert B. Shetterly, then-CEO of Clorox. Although Shetterly was a prominent businessman and a long-time resident of Orinda, he also had ties in Oakland, and he encouraged a number of businesses to move to Oakland over other local cities. Clorox helped fund EOYDC in its early years and later on. Since it opened, it began providing free programs five days a week for people in the Elmhurst District of East Oakland. Since 1994, EOYDC has been under the leadership of Regina Jackson.  Mission  The mission of EOYDC is to develop the social and leadership capacities of youth so that they succeed in education, career, and service to their communities. EOYDC works to incorporate relationship building, youth and community involvement, and skill building. It also aims to lessen the risks faced by youth, increasing protection. EOYDC tries to fulfill this mission by offering educational, cultural, artistic expression and recreation programs.  Programs  The four core programs of EOYDC are art, education, jobs, and wellness. These departments are structured to encourage self-sufficiency and responsibility. Of primary concern at the EOYDC is teaching youth to embrace their cultures and to live and work responsibly and cooperatively with other communities. EOYDC offers three education programs: After School Leadership Academy, Pathway to College and Career, and Education Empowerment. The After School Leadership Academy is an after school program for students in kindergarten to 8th grade. The program provides homework help, tutoring, and enrichment activities. Pathway to College and Career is a readiness program to prepare students in 9th to 12th grade for post-secondary life, with an emphasis on college persistence and completion. The program has workshops, SAT prep, and discussion forums. From 2010 to 2016, the program had a 96% college graduation rate among alumni. Education Empowerment is for students ages 17.5 and up who have not completed high school. The program prepares students to take the High School Equivalency Test (HiSET, previously known as the GED).  Funding and sponsors  EOYDC receives some government funding, while most funding comes from private grants and donors, and some from corporate grants and individuals. The largest donors include: U.S. Bank, Clorox Company Foundation, Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation, SD Bechtel Jr. Foundation, Northern California Community Loan Fund, Lexus,http://www.coliseumlexusofoakland.com/blog/coliseum-lexus-of-oakland- supports-the-83770?referrer=https://www.google.com/ SouthWest Airlines,https://www.southwestaircommunity.com/t5/Southwest-Stories/Southwest- Celebrates-Black-History-All-Year/ba-p/43065 Apple, the musician Prince,http://www.sfgate.com/aboutsfgate/article/It-s-possible-Prince- donated-34-million-to-the-8339408.php#photo-1888158 the San Francisco Foundation,http://sff.org/the-san-francisco-foundation-makes-34-million- investment-in-oakland/ and others.

Early life and education Corral was born in Ciudad Cuauht√©moc in the northern state of Chihuahua. She earned a degree in industrial chemical engineering from the Chihuahua Institute of Technology, a master's degree in mathematics from CINVESTAV, and a Ph.D. in materials science from the Center for Advanced Materials Research (CIMAV) in Chihuahua. She also completed postdoctoral work at CIMAV's Monterrey campus. Career Corral is a research professor at the National Technological Institute of Mexico and the Institute of Technology of Ciudad Cuauht√©moc. Her current research focuses on astrophysics, particularly the mathematics of general relativity, black holes and wormholes, the origins of the universe, and Sir Roger Penrose's theories of cosmology. She presented a paper titled \\"Matem√°ticas Aplicadas a los Materiales\\" at the School of Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering in Dublin in 2003, and \\"Modelling heat transfer in work rolls of a continuous hot strip mill, Part I\\" in 2005 at City, University of London. The latter was published as a chapter of the book Mathematical Modelling: Education, Engineering and Economics. In Istanbul in 2012, she presented research conducted with three generations of mechatronics students at the Institute of Technology of Ciudad Cuauht√©moc, titled \\"Dise√±o de un robot mecatr√≥nico para dar terapia y remover tumores\\". She received the 2013 Chihuahua Award in Technological Sciences for this work. In 2009, the Scientific Committee of the 5th International Conference on Diffusion in Solids and Liquids gave her the Joseph Fourier Award for her research on heat transfer into black holes. Since then, she has published several articles on Penrose's cosmic censorship hypothesis; on energy transfer and fluid flow around massive astrophysical objects; and on modelling the structure of wormholes, virtual particles from the Big Bang, and mass transfer in the Higgs boson. Her research on the Higgs boson, which she presented in Vilamoura, Portugal, in 2011, predicted with high accuracy the mass of the Higgs boson. Her prediction was identical to the value later reported on July 4, 2012, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider. At Imperial College London on July 2, 2015, Corral presented a model that, using relativistic equations, predicted very low entropy at the Big Bang. Her theory disagreed with the phase-space volume posited by Stephen Hawking, who, Corral said, did not take into account the asymmetrical component of time when calculating the entropy in the Big Bang singularity. However, it matched Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis, which does take that into account. As such, she is a supporter of the cyclic model of the Universe, in which the initial conditions match the final ones.  Awards  Corral received various awards for her contributions to science including, notably, the Joseph Fourier Award in 2009, for her scientific contributions in the understanding of solid and liquid diffusion.

The bridge was built in 1924, originally with a span and a width of . It was widened to in 1939 because of increasing traffic loads. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The state of Minnesota, in 1921, established a trunk highway system. Trunk Highway 1 was one of the longest routes, starting on the border of Iowa and going through Albert Lea, Minneapolis, Duluth, Two Harbors, and Grand Portage before ending at the border with Canada. The portion of Highway 1 along Lake Superior was exceptionally scenic, located on a rocky ledge cut by cascading streams. A travel writer in the 1920s wrote this about the highway: > Beyond argument, the drive on this northern shore of Lake Superior between > Duluth and Port Arthur [Canada] is a natural classic. This is the land of > the sky-blue water and the cathedral red rocks, where the prophetic Indian > voice of Gitchie Manitou booms to the joyous loneliness amid the million sea > gulls flying like snow. A most satisfying road clings to the shore, now > streaming with light, now cut through somber jungle of blue-black trees. The rock-rimmed river gorges were more economically bridged with concrete arch bridges, since the footings could be formed directly from the exposed bedrock. The bridge is notable for its Classical Revival detailing. Usually, the Minnesota Highway Department devoted more detailing to urban bridges than rural bridges, but the scenic location on a popular tourist route lent itself to a more architecturally-detailed approach. As a result, the bridge was designed with open-balustrade railings, an emphatic archivolt, and monumental pilasters with recessed panels accented by contrasting concrete finishes. The original bridge was finished in 1924. By 1934, so many travelers were using the highway that the highway department proposed widening the bridge. Funds were not available until 1939, at which point the bridge was widened. The cost of widening the bridge was $12,793, and the widening respected the bridge's original design.

Location and natural features Beltingham River Shingle refers to a section of the River South Tyne comprising a coarse-grained shingle island and southern riverbank covering an area of situated in the south-west of Northumberland some north-west of the village of Beltingham and south-east of Bardon Mill. The site lies at above sea level on a river which drains a watershed including parts of the Northern Pennine Orefield. High levels of heavy metal have built up in the river sediment forming the site's island and riverbank, and on this thrive a community of metal-tolerant plants able to cope with the sediment's poor water retention characteristic. Vegetation The vegetation of the Beltingham River Shingle is a sparse mix of spring sandwort (Minuartia verna), alpine pennycress (Thlaspi alpestre), mountain pansy (Viola lutea), thrift (Armeria maritima), common scurvy grass (Cochlearia officinalis) and sea campion (Silene maritima), with meadow oat- grass (Avenula pratensis), wild thyme (Thymus praecox), biting stonecrop (Sedum acre) and harebell (Campanula rotundifolia). Lichens found at the site include dog lichen (Peltigera canina) and reindeer lichen (Cladonia rangiformis). A woodland has developed on finer alluvial deposits containing alder (Alnus glutinosa) and willow (Salix spp.) with some birch (Betula sp.), elm (Ulmus glabra) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Scot‚Äôs pine (Pinus sylvestris). Wooded areas exhibit ground-cover of dog‚Äôs mercury (Mercurialis perennis), wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), red campion (Silene dioica), hedge woundwort (Stachys sylvatica), moschatel (Adoxa moschatellina) and wood sage (Teucrium scordonia). The river margin is marked by himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), lesser burdock (Arctium minus) and monkey flower (Mimulus guttatus). The narrow-lipped helleborine (Epipactis leptochila), more common on the chalk downs of southern England, is found in this and other the metalliferous shingle sites in the county.

Early life Shekleton was born in Dundalk, Ireland, around the year 1795. He was one of 10 children: five boys and five girls. His mother was Margaret Pentland from County Louth and his father was a merchant named Joseph Shekleton. Shekleton's grandfather held property at Pepperstown in Ardee in County Louth. Shekleton attended primary school in Dundalk. Career As the age of 15, Shekleton began training in medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland under Abraham Colles. He graduated on 27 August 1816 and moved to Paris, France, to continue his studies. Shekleton returned to Ireland in 1817 and was appointed as anatomy demonstrator at RCSI. He was elected to membership of RCSI on 1 February 1819. On 1 May 1820, RCSI established a museum with a budget of ¬£200 per year, overseen by a five-member committee. Candidates for the position of curator were required to demonstrate examples of their anatomy specimens. Shekleton presented a mercury injection of the lymph system of the lower limb and was appointed as curator with a salary of ¬£30 per annum. On 17 February 1821, Shekleton received an increased salary of ¬£40. In 1823, he was promoted in title to conservator. As of 2014, Shekleton's winning specimen remains on display in the RCSI anatomy department. By 1822, Shekleton has amassed over 600 specimens, which he increased to more than 1,300 by December 1823. The collection included natural history specimens in jars, partial and complete skeletons, and stuffed and mounted examples from nature. Shekleton discovered the muscle compressor venae dorsalis penis. After Shekleton's sudden death at the age of 29, he was succeeded as curator by his apprentice John Houston. Death Shekleton's death on 18 May 1824 was attributed to sepsis from a needlestick injury acquired while performing an autopsy 11 days beforehand.

It is consistently ranked as one of the top programs in Neurobiology and behavior in the world. The Department is part of the Basic Research Program at Harvard Medical School, with research pertaining to development of the nervous system, sensory neuroscience, neurophysiology, and behavior. The Department was founded by Stephen W. Kuffler in 1966, the first department dedicated to Neurobiology in the world. The mission of the Department is ‚Äú to understand the workings of the brain through basic research and to use that knowledge to work toward preventive and therapeutic methods that alleviate neurological diseases‚Äù.  History  Prior to moving to Boston, while at Johns Hopkins University, Kuffler recruited Torsten N. Wiesel, David Hubel, David Potter, and Edwin Furshpan to work on various aspects of nerve physiology. As Hubel later recounted, Wiesel, Hubel, and Kuffler \\"...represented central nervous system physiology; Furshpan and Potter (and of course Steve) represented synaptic physiology; and Ed Kravitz, representing neurochemistry, arrived soon after our move to Harvard.\\" The group moved to Harvard Medical School in 1959 as a sub-department within the Department of Pharmacology, headed by Otto Krayer. In 1966, Kuffler came up with the term neurobiology to unite these sub-disciplines into the first-ever Department of Neurobiology, an independent department at Harvard Medical School. Hubel later said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be absolutely certain how the term neurobiology originated, but I believe Steve Kuffler invented it when we had to think up a title for our department when it was founded on 1965. That he almost single-handedly invented the field of neurobiology, I think few would dispute.‚Äù Early on, the founders of the Department worked to recruit students and researchers to work in their laboratories, and paid special attention to recruiting with a social conscience. According to David Potter, \\"There‚Äôs another fact of the department that interests me personally, [that] has to do with our involvement in acceptance of medical students who were minorities‚Ä¶ it was something new, and it was a political struggle and that made it very interesting. I spent a lot of time there, time that I should have been spending in the lab doing science and research, on admissions and recruiting, and I got kind of devoted to that. I don‚Äôt regret that at all, it was an education for me.\\" Wiesel chaired the department from 1973, and was succeeded by David Potter in 1982, Gerald Fishbach in 1990, and Carla Shatz in 2000 (the first female to chair such a department). In 2008, Michael E. Greenberg assumed the position of Department chair, a position he currently holds. Under his leadership, he has integrated Harvard Neurobiology with neuroscience in the Harvard-affiliated hospitals, such as Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, Dana- Farber Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. To further facilitate the interaction and collaboration of neuroscientists at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA and Harvard Medical School, the Harvard Brain Initiative, co-chaired by Michael Greenberg and Joshua Sanes, funds collaborations and research initiatives specifically between members of the Department faculty and other neuroscientists at Harvard University. In October 2016, current and past faculty, students, and researchers will gather in Boston to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the Department.  Notable Contributions to Neurobiology  * Receptive fields in visual cortex: Pioneering work on the selective responses of retinal ganglion cells by Kuffler * Discovery of critical periods, ocular dominance columns, and orientation selectivity: Hubel and Wiesel discovered that experience can shape the brain‚Äôs circuitry, but only during early life, a period of time they call the ‚Äòcritical period‚Äô. This work in the visual cortex earned the duo the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981. * Development of electrodes: Hubel developed an electrode for recording of single neurons in awake cats. * Kravitz, Potter, and colleagues define GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter * Activity-dependent transcription in neurons during development of neural circuits, and in neurodevelopmental disorders * Central sensitization in pain * Processing of sub-modalities of vision in primates * Cortical area specifically dedicated to face recognition * Fundamental principles of olfactory processing * Characterization and modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and discovery of rapsyn * Molecular and biophysical analysis of auditory hair cells * Novel GABAergic pathway from basal ganglia to cortex * Discovery of enhancer RNA, RNA transcribed at enhancer sites in the genome * The molecular impact of the ketogenic diet in epilepsy * Blood brain barrier development and regulation * Real-time 3D imaging of mouse behavior to phenotype and analyze mouse behavior * Timing of neurotransmitter release from synapse and asynchronous release from synapses * Role of CRY1 and CRY2 in mammalian circadian clock * New treatment target for glioblastoma * Pain receptor specific local anesthesia  Current Research and Academic Staff  The Department currently has 38 faculty members and close to 300 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and other research staff. The Department‚Äôs current research generally encompasses the following areas: * Development and plasticity of the brain * Characterization of GABA and other amine neurotransmitters * Sensory neuroscience and processing in Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and nonhuman primates * Ion channel physiology * Neurobiology of Behavior * Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders * Neuropsychiatric disorders * Development of technologies to activate and monitor neuronal activity * Regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms The Department's faculty also participates in the Program in Neuroscience PhD Program offered by Harvard University.

Its headwaters seem to have been in the ravine that contains Glen Davis Crescent, because residents report small springs breaking out. In the 19th century Tomlin's Creek, a smaller creek, with no name, and a larger creek that came to be known as Small's Creek, lay on a large parcel of land owned by Charles Coxwell Small, a gentleman farmer, and prominent public official, in Upper Canada. Just north of the present location of Queen Street, Small had a dam built, to create a millpond, to power sawmills. That millpond came to be known as Small's Pond. Tomlin's Creek, and the other tributaries to Small's Pond remained clean, until the end of the 19th century. The pond had become popular for swimming and fishing, in the summer, and slabs of ice were harvested, during the winter. But the surrounding area was annexed into the growing city of Toronto, and with increased urbanization the creeks were quickly polluted, and the decision was made to bury the creeks, and convert them to sewers. Residents who live near the spring outcroppings fear the development of dangerous sinkholes.

The company creates and licenses music for use in television, film, advertising, and online media. Their library consists of music in a wide variety of genres. It includes music from artists and composers such as Quincy Jones, Hans Zimmer, George Martin, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Junkie XL, Labrinth, Ramin Djawadi, Timbaland, Ricky Reed, Brian Tyler, Blues Saraceno, Rodney Jerkins, Eddie Kramer, John Debney, and Dweezil Zappa. Extreme Music is headquartered in London, with its creative operations based in a 7,500 square-foot production compound in Santa Monica, California. History Extreme Music was founded in London by Russell Emanuel and Dolph Taylor in 1997. Emanuel had played bass with a punk band, Class Ties, and worked a day job as a studio assistant at MCA Music Publishing and Abbey Road Studios. After leaving MCA, Emanuel worked at Bruton, a production music library which produced sound-alike music that was recorded, produced, and licensed inexpensively. He recorded one sound- alike album for Bruton, and financed his band‚Äôs touring through the royalties the album generated. Emanuel also managed bands, including Stiff Little Fingers. After beginning a job at a third production library, MatchMusic, Emanuel and Stiff Little Fingers drummer Dolph Taylor began to compose music for MatchMusic together. They built a MIDI suite, and when not on tour, they recorded original tracks that reflected their own musical sensibilities. \\"We were forever knocking our heads against old-school attitudes and being told that 'This is what the marketplace likes.' But we were seeing a new generation of editors coming into the industry and going to clubs and hearing all these thumping records, and they wanted to know why production music didn't sound like that,\\" Taylor said in a 2003 interview. Taylor and Emanuel decided to approach commercial artists, some of whom they already knew, and ask them to record production music tracks. With a $100,000 investment from angel investor Mark Levinson, Extreme Music was founded in 1997. The company was positioned to reflect the punk rock ethos of its founders; for example, they mailed condoms to 1,000 music industry executives with packaging that read \\"Extreme Music: The Only Safe Thing You'll Ever Get From Us.\\" With a focus on production, they \\"upped the industry ante by using professional recording studios and top-notch musicians.\\" By keeping the library's emphasis on quality over quantity, they streamlined the process of selecting music for advertising agencies and music supervisors. In August 2005 Extreme Music was bought by Viacom, the then-parent company of CBS, UPN, and Paramount Pictures for $45.1 million, and in 2008 it was acquired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing. The terms of the sale were not disclosed. In January 2013, Extreme introduced Customix, a web application created specifically for music supervisors to quickly customize songs from its library. Extreme Music tracks have been licensed by editors, music producers and music supervisors at production companies, networks and advertising agencies, including A+E, Fox, BBC, HBO, the NFL and Apple. Among other productions, music from the Extreme library has been used in Mad Men, Ray Donovan, Dancing with the Stars, Birdman, Creed and It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia. In August 2013, Extreme partnered with composer Hans Zimmer and his business partner, Steve Kofsky, to launch Bleeding Fingers Music. A joint venture, it creates show-specific libraries and scores for unscripted, reality, documentary and light drama television shows. In 2017, it was ranked as the leading custom music scoring company in the industry.

At the 2013 European Junior Championships in Rieti Weber took gold with a fifth- round throw of 79.68 m, a personal best and the best in the world by a junior that year; he narrowly defeated Ukraine's Maksym Bohdan, who also threw beyond the previous world junior leading mark. Weber broke 80 meters for the first time in 2014 (80.72 m), winning silver behind Thomas R√∂hler at that year's national championships. In 2015 he improved his best to 81.15 m and placed fifth at the European U23 Championships in Tallinn. Weber reached a new level in 2016, throwing beyond 82 meters in four spring meets; at the national championships he again placed second behind R√∂hler (with a personal best 83.79 m), but was still left out of the German team for the European Athletics Championships in Amsterdam. Weber broke his personal best twice more on 29 June 2016 with throws of 84.45 m and 86.83 m at the Paavo Nurmi Games in Turku; the three-meter improvement marked his breakthrough to the world elite, though he was still overshadowed by R√∂hler, who won the competition with a world-leading 91.28 m and also had a second throw beyond 91 meters. A week and a half later Weber threw 88.04 m in Offenburg, moving him to fourth place on the 2016 world list. He was selected to represent Germany at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, together with R√∂hler and Johannes Vetter.

His death became the first recorded mountaineering fatality in North America.  Biography  Abbot was a graduate of Harvard (1889), and of Harvard Law School (1893). He practiced law until 1894 with Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis of Boston. He then went to Milwaukee, where he was employed as assistant attorney for the Wisconsin Central Railroad (1871‚Äì99), of which his father, Edwin Hale Abbot, was president. The original family home was at 1 Follon Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts the now renowned Edwin Abbot House; but the family in 1896 were at Bar Harbor, Maine.Cambridge Tribune_1896-08-08_0001.pdf Mountaineer Philip S. Abbot was considered an experienced mountain climber, in the United States; one who had made expeditions to the Alps and ascended the Matterhorn and Weisshorn; with Swiss guide Peter Sarbach. In 1893, Philip S. Abbot published, \\"An Ascent of the Weisshorn\\".\\"An Ascent of the Weisshorn\\", Author Philip S. Abbot In 1895, with Professor Charles Ernest Fay of Tufts College, and Charles Sproull Thompson, General Agent for the Illinois Central Railroad, the three climbers failed in two ascents of Mount Lefroy in the Bow Range near Lake Louise, Alberta; but managed to make the first Ascent of Mt. Hector. The next year, Professor George Little, Librarian of Bowdoin joined the trio for the 1896 Expedition. Catastrophe and death  On Aug. 3, 1896 Philip Stanley Abbot slipped from the rock precipice while free climbing Mount Lefroy in the Bow Range near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada. As described by Charles E. Fay, \\"The unfortunate Philip S. Abbot fell past us and landed within 15 feet; while tumbling the remaining distance, to a rocky projection, one thousand feet below our perch\\". It took the three survivors most of the afternoon to descend to where the body rested; each depending on their own skill with an ice axe for safety. Upon their arrival, Mr. Abbot was still breathing but unable to speak; and he died soon thereafter. As it was impossible to carry the body down the slippery descent the party was compelled to leave the body, and return the next Tuesday with a rescue party. The rescue party was led by outfitter Thomas Edmonds Wilson and included George Little, Willoughby Astley, and Professor Charles Ernest Fay.Glenbow Museum, Call No.: NA-673-11, Title: Search party on Victoria Glacier, Alberta, Date: 1896The Canadian Rockies: Pioneers, Legends and True Tales, By Roger W.

He converted 17 drop kicks into field goals in a game between the Bobcats' freshman team and Billings Polytechnic Institute. The Bobcats won the game by a score of 64‚Äì0. The Bobcats helped him set up his drop kicks by falling short of the goal line instead of scoring. Peters also made 15 drop kicks in a game once. Montana State athletic director Schubert Dyche said that \\"We agreed that every time we got inside the 30-yard line. Frosty would drop kick one.\\" He transferred to play for the Illinois Fighting Illini of the University of Illinois in 1925, where he was a part of the Illini freshman football team. He was heralded by some to be a potential successor to Red Grange. Peters lettered in football for the Illini in 1926, 1928 and 1929. He sat out the 1927 season due to a knee injury. He helped lead the Illini to the outdoor national championship as a member of the 1927 track and field team. Peters played in the 1930 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game.

He is known for a Latin poem on Genesis in hexameters and a letter to the abbot Salomon against the moral degradation of his age. Biography Evidence for Claudius's life comes from Gennadius of Massilia.Gennadius de Marseille, De Viris Illustribus, 61, NPNF2-03. Theodoret, Jerome, Gennadius, & Rufinus: Historical Writings Christian Classics Ethereal Library. He was born in the second half of the fourth century and died during the reign of Theodosius the Younger and Valentinian III, around 446. Works Gennadius of Massilia assigns a poem on Genesis, the Aletheia (i.e. Ancient Greek ·ºÄŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±, 'truth'), to Claudius Marius Victor, orator Massiliensis ('an orator from Marseille'). This 1020-line hexametrical poem, intended for the instruction of the young, survives in one ninth-century manuscript and dates from the first or second quarter of the fifth century CE. It contains a prayer and three books which retell Genesis, from the creation of the world to the ruin of Sodom.O. J. Kuhnmuench, Early Christian Latin Poets (Chicago, 1929), pp. 331-46 (at p. 331), https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001058147. The author was inspired by Lucretius, Virgil and Ovid and transposes Christian content into a Classical literary form, the epic. Victorius's other known work is a letter to the abbot Salomon. Here he argues that if the Sarmatians, from Central Asia, have devastated the country, if the Vandals, a Germanic people, have burned it, and if the Alans, who were Sarmatian, have completed that destructions, it is because men have committed errors, and it is sexuality which he blames. Significance Gennadius's view of Victorius was not flattering: > Victorinus, a rhetorician of Marseilles, wrote to his son Etherius, a > commentary On Genesis, commenting, that is, from the beginning of the book > to the death of the patriarch Abraham, and published four books in verse, > words which have a savour of piety indeed, but, in that he was a man busied > with secular literature and quite untrained in the Divine Scriptures, they > are of slight weight, so far as ideas are concerned.Gennadius de Marseille, > De Viris Illustribus, 61, NPNF2-03. Theodoret, Jerome, Gennadius, & Rufinus: > Historical Writings Christian Classics Ethereal Library. However, Victorius's work fits into the tradition of Christian writers of the first centuries CE, such as Juvencus, Sedulius Arator, Cyprianus Gallus, and Avit. Indeed, the transposition of the divine word and/or the celebration of the deeds of saints thrives in the Classical epic form.Marta Cuenca-Godbert, 'L‚Äô√©pique re-cycl√©', Acta Fabula, 8.2 (March‚ÄìApril 2007), http://www.fabula.org/revue/document2767.php. His letter has historical interest, particularly for alluding once or twice to the tribes of Gaul and the barbarians. It also mentions the Alans (III, V 192) and Leuques (III, V. 207-209).

From 1945 to 1987, Ross worked largely with the US Navy, making developments in reduction of submarine detection and underwater noise. Ross is credited with discovering that low-frequency ocean ambient noise is largely determined by shipping, and that ocean ambient noise has been steadily increasing due to human activities. He also made the first detailed measurements of the noise characteristics of nuclear submarines. Early life Ross was born in 1922, in New York City. Originally interested in Egyptology in his years of high school (as well as knowing the ancient Egyptian alphabet), Ross attended DeWitt Clinton High School before transferring to Riverdale Country School; both in the Bronx. He was accepted to the University of Chicago as an Archaeology major in 1939, on the eve of WWII. Ross' headmaster at Riverdale persuaded him \\"in view of the world situation\\" to apply to Harvard as a Physics major instead. From there, he graduated in 1942 with a BS in Physics,http://acousticstoday.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/11/Ross.pdf going on to complete his PhD in Applied Physics & Engineering Science from Harvard in 1953. Career = Harvard Underwater Sound Lab and the Ordnance Research Lab, Penn State = Upon completion of his undergraduate degree, Ross received a teaching fellowship in Harvard's Physics department. Edwin C. Kemble, head of the department for the duration of Ross' time there worked at the Harvard Underwater Sound Lab (HSUL), where he sought ways to design quiet propellers for acoustic homing torpedoes. In late 1944, with the end of the war approaching, the torpedo project arranged with Penn State to move at war‚Äôs end to the new Ordnance Research Lab (ORL). Kemble realized he would not be going to Penn State and needed a successor for the project. Kemble asked Ross to join him for several months at HUSL with the intention of carrying on the propellor work at Penn State. In his senior year of college, Ross had specialized in nuclear physics before the classification of the field during the war. Recruiters for the Manhattan project arranged for him to be sent to Los Alamos as an army sergeant, but in the process of the medical examination, his right eardrum was punctured, thus disqualifying him. Ross stayed in Cambridge for the remainder of the war. While on the HSUL staff before making the move to Penn State, Ross first learned about propeller cavitation, the main source of propeller noise. In his studies during this time, he developed an index to be used by naval architects in predicting the degree of cavitation for ship, submarine and torpedo propellers. He was able to explain why the propellers of American submarines produced cavitation at speeds much lower than those that had been predicted by their designers, as well as developing an explanation for the \\"anomalous depth effect.‚Äù These insights lead to the creation of the Garfield Thomas Water Tunnel. = Bell Labs = Shortly after completing his PhD in 1952, Ross was requested by Bell Telephone Labs (BTL) to join them as the hydrodynamicist on a Navy program to design and construction a system of underwater sensors (SOSUS sound surveillance system) intended to provide an early warning of the approach from a distance of any Russian missile-carrying submarine. The system used a signal processor called LOFAR, which detected low-frequency tonal components radiated by ships and submarines. Ross was assigned part-time to the small BTL group helping the Navy evaluate performance and developing target classification guides. Each SOSUS station had LOFAR equipment for forty directional beams and in the beginning records were kept of all the (mostly) merchant ship detections. It soon became apparent that some beams held many more ship contacts than others. It was also confirmed that the ships detected on these ‚Äúhot beams‚Äù were more distant than those detected on other beams. Using a globe and following great circle routes Ross, in partnership with Larry Churchill, found that the hot beams originated on the other side of the ocean, at such places as Gibraltar and the English Channel, where ships transited between shallow water and deep water. Originally called the ‚ÄúMegaphone Effect‚Äù these long-range detections were explained by the phenomenon of down-slope propagation, by which sound from a near-surface source is reflected by a sloping bottom into the deep sound channel, where it can propagate long distances with minimum loss. Low- frequency ambient noise and sound propagation were both measured by the SOSUS system. Invariably, ambient noise levels were found to be significantly lower than would have been expected from extrapolating levels that had been measured at higher frequencies during WWII. Ross was one of the first to connect this finding with information that undersea noise caused by rain and similar sources had been found to peak at frequencies between 500 and 1000 Hz and was significantly lower at the frequencies used by SOSUS. From this observation and some measurements made by Woods Hole shortly after WWII, Ross developed the first set of ambient noise spectra for which the amplitudes at low- frequencies depended on shipping densities. These curves, developed in 1954, were the first that recognized that only above about 300 Hz was the ambient controlled by noise from wind and waves, and at lower frequencies the noise was independent of sea conditions, and instead was due to shipping. Until he left BTL in 1958, Ross worked actively to quiet the , the US Navy's first nuclear submarine. He also worked closely with the Navy to confirm, through sound signature, that the Russians had developed their own nuclear submarine (November-class submarine) only two years after the Nautilus was built. It was later discovered that a spy had stolen the plans for the Nautilus and given them to the Soviets. = Bolt, Beranek and Newman, ONR London, and Naval Ship Research & Development Center = In 1958, Ross began work at the fledgling acoustic consulting firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge. Here, he wrote reports on a wide variety of topics related to submarine noise, some of which contributed directly to the Navy‚Äôs ability to build quiet nuclear submarines. He remained a SOSUS consultant in this time. From 1964 to 1965, Ross and his family lived in London. Ross, for a year, was given a prestigious position at the Office of Naval Research as their Acoustics Liaison Scientist. His job was to interview acoustians in the UK and Europe and to report back to the ONR on their research. Ross and his family returned to the states in 1965, and by 1967 Ross was selected as the third Head of the Ship Acoustics and Vibrations Laboratory (SAD) of the Naval Ship Research and Development Center (NSRDC) (formerly David Taylor Model Basin - DTMB) at Carderock, MD. In this time, Ross participated in about a dozen nuclear submarine noise trials. The most notable of the incidents Ross was involved in during this time there were the \\"Crazy Ivan\\" special op attacks. = \\"Crazy Ivan\\" = The special missions of attack class submarines took the US Navy into Soviet waters, and collisions with Russian submarines were occurring. At DTMB this was suspected, as they were sometimes asked to analyze pieces of rubber coating or samples of paint that came from Soviet submarines. What they didn‚Äôt know was that reports of these collisions were interfering with high-level disarmament talks. The situation got so bad that at the end of April 1970, then President Nixon suspended all special operations, at least until he could be assured that collisions could be avoided. On Saturday May 2, Admiral Dennis Wilkinson called a group from several organizations to his office in Norfolk and explained the problem. They were to find and fix the cause of the collisions. Wilkinson assigned three Sturgeon-class submarines to Ross and his lab for two weeks. In his position as head of the lead lab, he was given operational control. On Sunday, he called a meeting of key personnel to organize the trial team and to plan the test agenda for what soon would become known as Operation Herman, in memory of former Bell Labs team member Herman Straub. That same day, the , the , and a third sub, left New London for Charleston, which was to be the project‚Äôs home base. There, the USS Whale was outfitted with special equipment to allow her to mimic the acoustic signature of a Soviet sub, and the USS Sunfish was prepared to act as the trailer. The third sub was to remain in port to be a backup should either of the other two have a problem. After two days, the Whale and Sunfish set sail to a remote location in the Bahamas for five days of simulated trailing encounters. The spherical sonar array was equipped with an auto-tracking system which gave the vertical as well as the horizontal direction of the strongest signal. Invariably the sonar was pointing up, implying that the listening sub was deeper than the sub being tracked . The problem was caused by surface reflections. The strongest signal was not coming directly from the contact, but was coming from the surface. What they did in their tests was to confirm the problem and then to develop a procedure to overcome it. On May 16, exactly two weeks after the original assignment, Ross was flown to Norfolk in the Admiral‚Äôs plane to present the test results and to help write a new operation order correcting the problem. That afternoon, Admiral Wilkinson flew to Washington and briefed President Nixon at the White House, and the President approved the resumption of special operations. In 1971, Ross received the Navy's highest civilian honor for his service, the Distinguished Civilian Service Award, and was made a life member of the Naval Submarine League. = Tetra Tech = In 1972, Ross began work at Tetra Tech in Rosslyn, Virginia under the premise that he and his family would be moved to San Diego after completion of a study for the Navy regarding a proposed cruise missile submarine. A computer model, SubSim, was to be used to simulate encounters between the new sub and a postulated Soviet submarine. The only problem was that these encounters would all involve sonars detecting the opponent‚Äôs radiated noise and Ross was to be the only person on the staff who had background knowledge in such matters. The simulations needed characteristics of Soviet submarines ten years in the future. The Navy had an official threat document; but that assumed that the Russians would just copy the quiet subs of the US, lagging at least five years. Dick Robinson and Ross designed their own threat and presented it to a Navy group headed by Admiral Ed Waller. After his 15-minute talk, the Admiral said he had heard many threat presentations and he could never tell which were based on hard intelligence, which were based on engineering calculation, and which were political. ‚ÄúWhich is yours?‚Äù he asked Ross, who responded with ‚Äúall three, Admiral‚Äù After which he repeated the talk giving the source type of each item. And, finally ‚Äúthe 35 knots speed is because Rickover wants to build a new 35-knot submarine.‚Äù The Admiral was so pleased that he invited Ross to present his talk to a senior group in the Pentagon. And soon their threat was adopted as the Navy‚Äôs official threat. In 1973, Ross and his family made the official move to San Diego. Ross served as the VP of Tetra Tech systems, and continued to do so until 1983. From 1976 to 1979, Ross also served as the Deputy Director of the SACLANT ASW Research Centre in La Spezia, Italy. In 1976, he authored Mechanics of Underwater Noise.Ross, Donald. Mechanics of Underwater Noise. New York: Pergamon Press, 1976.  Post career  Ross spent his retired years as a dedicated volunteer and public servant. He was a five-year volunteer with the San Diego Police Department Domestic Violence Unit, a member of the Catfish Club, and involved with the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of San Dieguito. He immersed himself in the study of cardiology, and studied the impact of statins on the elderly. He also studied and lectured on climate change. Personal life Ross married his first wife Harriet May Murphy in 1942. They had three sons (Franklin, Bill, and Andy) before divorcing in October 1972. Ross married Nancy Martin in November 1972. They remained together until her death in May 2010. Awards He received the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award for ‚Äúsolution of numerous urgent and important submarine operational problems.‚Äù Ross was a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America.

In 2019, he was the unanimous selection for Saskatchewan Roughriders Most Outstanding Canadian, and was named a finalist for CFL Most Outstanding Canadian. After the CFL canceled the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Judge chose to opt-out of his contract with the Roughriders on August 28, 2020. Personal life He is the second-oldest child of actor and former Oregon Ducks' safety Christopher Judge and former Wilhelmina and Folio runway and print model Margaret Judge, known for her work as a Virginia Slims model. He is the brother of Christopher Jordan Judge, who played as an outside linebacker for the UCLA Bruins, Catrina Judge, a fitness trainer and half-sister Chloe Judge.

Facts Mr Ruiz was employed by Zenith, Inc in Harvey, Louisiana. Zenith had a contract with Shell Oil Co to do welding, removing a dent in a metal tank that separated oil and water on one of Shell's barges. The tank was made by the National Tank Company, and it contracted with Shell to supervise tank repair, providing an employee named Mr Crowley. NTC had no contract with Zenith. Mr Ruiz was injured when a 30-ton hydraulic jack struck him after being dislodged on the barge. He sued Shell and NTC in negligence for the barge being unseaworthy, and Shell claimed damages from NTC. A jury awarded Mr Ruiz $50,000, and found only NTC's negligence was a proximate cause of injury. Judgment The Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit held that NTC was liable to Ruiz, although on the facts it did not count as an employer. Relevant to that question would be which employer had more control, whose work was being performed, whether there were agreements in place, who provided tools, had a right to discharge the employee, or had the obligation to pay.

Thomson Summit and Thomson Glacier are named in her honor. She was a 2001 recipient of the British Antarctic Survey's Fuchs Medal, and in 2003, she was the recipient of the Polar Medal. Biography Janet Wendy Thomson was born in 1942 in Staffordshire, England. She attended Bedford College and later the University of London. Thomson began working for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in 1964, but was barred from participating in actual trips to Antarctica because policy forbade women, because of the hardship it would impose. For eighteen years, Thomson pressed to have the restriction lifted. Not making headway with the British team, Thomson joined an American expedition in 1976, becoming the first British woman to conduct fieldwork in the Antarctic. In 1983, Thomson became the first British woman scientist working inside the Antarctic Circle on a British team, when the BAS finally lifted their gender barrier. Peter D. Rowley who led the United States Antarctic Research Program geological survey during the 1984 to 1985 season, suggested that Thomson Summit, a peak in the Behrendt Mountains of Palmer Land, be named in Thomson's honor in 1986. Thomson Glacier, is also named for her. Thomson served as head of the Mapping and Geographical Information Center (MAGIC) prior to her 2003 retirement. She then worked on a topographic map of Antarctica with the Committee on Antarctic Research Digital Topographic Database. In 2003, she was awarded the Polar Medal for her outstanding service to polar research. Thomson and other noted British scientists were interviewed in an oral history project for the British Library in 2013.

Da Corte often uses surreal imagery and everyday objects in his practice and explores ideas of consumerism, pop culture, mythology, and literature. He has shown internationally at Bodega, Gi√≥ Marconi, Josh Lilley Gallery, Maccarone, Herning Museum of Contemporary Art, Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, and Institute of Contemporary Art. Da Corte has worked on a number of collaborative projects with other visual artists, writers, and musicians including Jayson Musson, Dev Hynes, Sam Mckinniss, and Annie Clark.  Early life and education  Da Corte was born in Camden, New Jersey, in 1980. He spent his formative years growing up in Venezuela. In 2001, he studied Film/Animation and Fine Arts at the School of Visual Arts in New York City and then went on to receive his BFA in Printmaking/Fine Arts, from The University of the Arts in Philadelphia in 2004. He graduated from Yale University with an MFA in 2010.  Work  Since 2013, Alex Da Corte has mounted shows from New York commercial galleries like Luxembourg & Dayan to international museums like The Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark. In 2014, Da Corte had a solo exhibition at the White Cube Gallery in London titled \\"White Rain\\". In 2015, Da Corte's solo show Die Hexe at Luxembourg & Dayan Gallery (NYC) was reviewed by art critic Roberta Smith of The New York Times. In a piece on the exhibition she wrote of Da Corte's previous work, \\"last year's show dazzled at every turn, weaving confounding narratives about innocence and decadence, mass production and eccentricity...\\" In 2016, Da Corte's opus was the subject of an exhibition entitled Free Roses at Mass MOCA in North Adams, Massachusetts which is the largest of his career so far. In the arena of hip hop, Da Corte directed the 2013 video for the track \\"Hush BB\\" by the rapper Le1f. He also contributed the cover art for the second studio album by the hip hop group Spank Rock 2013's \\"Everything Is Boring and Everyone Is a Fucking Liar\\". In the recent past Da Corte has taken to taking on the persona of the rapper Eminem which was the crux of his solo exhibition \\"Bad Land\\" at the Josh Lilley gallery in London which ran from November 2017 until February 2018. Da Corte's work is included in the 2019 58th edition of the Venice Biennale \\"May You Live in Interesting Times\\" curated by Ralph Rugoff and appears in both main sections with 57 Varities in the arsenale and The Decorated Shed in the giardini.  Collaborations  Throughout Da Corte's career, he has collaborated with other artists, including Borna Sammak, Sean Fitzgerald, Jayson Musson and Dev Hynes. Da Corte's collaborative installation, Easternsports (2014), is two and a half hours of atmospheric video on four channels, and a disjointed essay-poem of tens of thousands of words running through the subtitles. The work was created with Jayson Musson and scored by Dev Hynes. After the completion of Easternsports Da Corte and Hynes worked together to create a video for GAP's \\"Play Your Stripes\\" campaign. Alex Da Corte's most recent collaboration opened on September 3, 2016 at the Herning Museum of Contemporary Art in Herning, Denmark. The exhibition titled, 50 Wigs showcases original sculptures by Da Corte alongside a collection of objects from Andy Warhol's personal estate. Working closely with the Andy Warhol Museum to bring the show to life, Da Corte \\"transforms Warhol's personal belongings to art objects\\" In 2017, Da Corte directed the music video for the musician St. Vincent's song \\"New York\\". In 2018, the duo reunited for a second pairing, whereby the artist/director employed the artist/musician in another video this time as part his exhibition \\"C-A-T Spells Murder\\" at the Karma gallery in New York City (February 18 ‚Äì March 18, 2018); where in an 11-minute video Da Corte shows St. Vincent holding a one eyed feline while the performer makes a series of facial expressions ending in terror while this film looped was played within an instillation which also featured an eleven foot high sculpture of a cat.

Life and career Davis was born October 22, 1992 in Los Angeles. She grew up in California and started taking riding lessons at the age of five. She grew as a rider and was supported by her family, who had some equestrian background, as her grandfather, Robert Barron Frieze, was a jockey's agent, and her mother rode casually. Davis accompanied her mother to the barn a few times a week and quickly became interested in horses. Her early riding career was with trainer Chacha Levinson at the Sullivan Canyon Preservation Association. She later moved to train with Archie Cox at Middle Ranch to compete in the hunters and equitation on the A and AA levels. During her time with Cox, Davis won many national championships in the equitation and hunters which include World Champion Hunter Rider in 2007. Davis showed in the pony and junior hunters competitive divisions before convincing her mother to let her compete in the jumper ring when she was fourteen. From then on, she advanced from the Low Junior Jumpers (1.20m) on her first junior jumper, Mister Mind. Growing up, Davis also played soccer, but she later dropped the sport at age sixteen to pursue equestrian competition full-time. Davis went to her first international competition when she attended the North American Junior and Young Rider Championships (NAJYRC). In 2009, she was the Individual Silver medalist with True Love, and in 2010 was on the Zone 10 Gold Medal winning team. Davis graduated from Stanford University (California). She is now based in Europe and travels the Western European circuit while still making frequent appearances in the United States show circuit. Davis is now in the upper levels of show jumping and was selected to be a member on the 2016 US Olympic Show Jumping Team that competed in Rio de Janeiro. She was selected to compete with her top mount, Barron, whom she has competed with in Nations Cups, World Cup Finals, and the 2014 World Equestrian Games. Davis placed tenth at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials but did not make the Olympic team that year. Davis and her teammates earned a bronze medal in team jumping at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.

Although Grimalkin was a polydactyl cat with seven toes on each front paw, the Smiths felt that five toes appeared more normal and patented the \\"toy animal figure\\" in October 1892. The design was sold by the Smiths for one cent a yard to Arnold Print Works, which then sold the printed pattern as \\"The Tabby Cat\\" on half a yard of muslin for ten cents each in late 1892. Nearly 200,000 were sold that first holiday season. The toy was very successful nationwide, making appearances at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and in the windows of Wanamaker's department store in Philadelphia. The toy's success led to other stuffed animals, including kittens, dogs, and bunnies. The Ithaca Kitty was especially known for its lifelike appearance and was allegedly used by farmers to scare away birds and by the Central Park police station to scare mice. Writer Eugene Field has said that the calico cat in his poem The Duel was inspired by the Ithaca Kitty.

Mass balance  A mass balance, also called a material balance, is an application of conservation of mass to the analysis of physical systems. It is the simplest governing equation, and it is simply a budget (balance calculation) over the quantity in question: \\\\text{Input} + \\\\text{Generation} = \\\\text{Output} + \\\\text{Accumulation} \\\\ + \\\\text{Consumption} Differential equation =Physics= The governing equations in classical physics that are lectured at universities are listed below. * balance of mass * balance of (linear) momentum * balance of angular momentum * balance of energy * balance of entropy * Maxwell-Faraday equation for induced electric field * Amp√©re-Maxwell equation for induced magnetic field * Gauss equation for electric flux * Gauss equation for magnetic flux = Classical continuum mechanics = The basic equations in classical continuum mechanics are all balance equations, and as such each of them contains a time-derivative term which calculates how much the dependent variable change with time. For an isolated, frictionless / inviscid system the first four equations are the familiar conservation equations in classical mechanics. Darcy's law of groundwater flow has the form of a volumetric flux caused by a pressure gradient. A flux in classical mechanics is normally not a governing equation, but usually a defining equation for transport properties. Darcy's law was originally established as an empirical equation, but is later shown to be derivable as an approximation of Navier-Stokes equation combined with an empirical composite friction force term. This explains the duality in Darcy's law as a governing equation and a defining equation for absolute permeability. The non-linearity of the material derivative in balance equations in general, and the complexities of Cauchy's momentum equation and Navier-Stokes equation makes the basic equations in classical mechanics exposed to establishing of simpler approximations. Some examples of governing differential equations in classical continuum mechanics are * Hele-Shaw flow * Plate theory ** Kirchhoff‚ÄìLove plate theory ** Mindlin‚ÄìReissner plate theory * Vortex shedding * Annular fin * Astronautics * Finite volume method for unsteady flow * Acoustic theory * Precipitation hardening * Kelvin's circulation theorem * Kernel function for solving integral equation of surface radiation exchanges * Nonlinear acoustics * Large eddy simulation * F√∂ppl‚Äìvon K√°rm√°n equations * Timoshenko beam theory =Biology= A famous example of governing differential equations within biology is * Lotka-Volterra equations are prey- predator equations  Sequence of states  A governing equation may also be a state equation, an equation describing the state of the system, and thus actually be a constitutive equation that has \\"stepped up the ranks\\" because the model in question was not meant to include a time-dependent term in the equation. This is the case for a model of an oil production plant which on the average operates in a steady state mode. Results from one thermodynamic equilibrium calculation are input data to the next equilibrium calculation together with some new state parameters, and so on. In this case the algorithm and sequence of input data form a chain of actions, or calculations, that describes change of states from the first state (based solely on input data) to the last state that finally comes out of the calculation sequence.

Nielsen with his partner, Carl Johnson, founded the firm Johnson and Nielsen. Nielsen was influential in the construction of many important structures in Southern California, including the Discovery Cube in Orange County, the Coussoulis Arena in San Bernardino (notable for its \\"spider-like\\" exterior frame work) and, most famously, the Forum in Inglewood, CA, which was the first structure of its kind to be built without support pillars. The engineering of the Forum was quite a feat as the structural design allowed no obstructed seats in the entire arena. Within the City of Riverside, three separate structures have been declared City Landmarks, including the Set Free Thrift Store on 14th Street, the Riverside Office Supply Store on 14th Street (refaced in 2013) and a garage on Market Street (demolished for redevelopment in 2012). All of these structures feature Mid Century Modern style architecture that was indicative of Nielsen's Danish influences. Nielsen also designed and engineered the Danish Lutheran Church and Cultural Center located in Yorba Linda, California, the Bachelor Quarters for the U.S. Naval base in Long Beach and over 5,000 other buildings. In addition to his work in architecture and engineering, Nielsen was one of the founding members of the California Seismic Review Board, which would generate the guidelines that would later become the foundation for Chapter 34, of the existing building and structures code. Most recently, Nielsen's own home in Riverside, California has been named a City of Riverside City of Riverside Landmark (City of Riverside Landmark #134). The unique home, fully designed and constructed by Nielsen himself, was completed in 1966 and is considered to be quintessentially representative of Mid Century Modern Architecture. Built on to a slope overlooking a lake on the 12th hole of the Victoria Country Club Golf Course, the home features large concrete columns, some as high as 20 feet, which support the home above the slope. However, the most notable feature of the home is its design, in which it is built entirely around an indoor swimming pool. The swimming pool room is over 2,000 square feet and features 20' tall ceilings and a retractable roof that opens to the sky. 440x440px References 1919 births 2013 deaths American architects People in building engineering American people of Danish descent Modernist architects from the United States ","title":"Svend Nielsen (architect and engineer)"},{"id":"51232841","text":"Profile of Terumi Tanaka is a Japanese anti-nuclear and anti-war activist and former professor.

The company is the second largest company in Egypt by revenue. It is the largest General Motors dealer in the world, and the fifth largest distributor of Caterpillar Inc. products globally. It also has contracts in Egypt to represent a range of international brands, including McDonald's, Chevrolet, Red Bull, UPS and Imperial Brands. It operates Egypt‚Äôs largest supermarket chain, Metro Markets, and the Kheir Zaman discount chain. The company also has a private investment firm, Man Capital, based in London. The company reported 2016 revenues of $6B US, with 60,000 employees and operations in 120 countries. The company is privately held and managed by the Mansour brothers Mohamed, Youssef and Yasseen, who are board members. History Mansour Group started as a cotton business founded in 1952 by Loutfy Mansour, one of the first Egyptians to graduate from Cambridge. The business was nationalized by Gamel Nasser in the 1970s, forcing Mansour to Sudan and eventually Switzerland, where he continued to work in the cotton business. His sons attended school in the United States while he was working. Eventually, when Egypt returned to a market economy in the early 1970s, Mansour and his sons were able to return. At that time, General Motors was looking for Egyptian partners to help them expand, and were connected with the Mansour family. The family set up a GM dealership and obtained Egyptian sales rights in 1975. The company was called Al-Mansour Automotive. In 1984, GM opened its first factory in Egypt, and 1985 the first GM vehicle was produced in the country. Al-Mansour Automotive gained rights to sell GM cars in Africa, and eventually became the largest GM dealership in the world. In 1977, Mansour Group secured rights to sell and distribute Caterpillar digging equipment in Egypt. The Mantrac subsidiary was formed to manage the Caterpillar business, and Mantrac eventually secured Caterpillar rights to Sub-Saharan Africa, Russia and Iraq. As of 2015. Mantrac was the fifth largest Caterpillar dealer in the world. 1n 1992, Mansour Group created an autonomous company, Mansour Financial, formally the Al-Mansour Holding Company for Financial Investments (MHCFI) to manage a license agreement with Philip Morris International (PMI) to produce and distribute PMI‚Äôs brands in Egypt. The Al-Mansour International Distribution Company (AMIDC) was created underneath Mansour Financial to manage the tobacco business. When the Philip Morris partnership ended in 2014, AMIDC partnered with Imperial Brands, then called Imperial Tobacco. Manfoods was created in 1994 to manage McDonald's franchises in Egypt. In 2000, the company launched Metro Markets, the first Egyptian-owned supermarket chain. The company launched its first discount store in 2006, called Kheir Zaman, which translates to \\"The Good Old Days\\". In 2010, Mansour Group founded Man Capital (aka Mancap), a private investment subsidiary. The family transferred its entire net worth to the new standalone entity incorporated in London. Subsidiaries =Man Capital= Man Capital (aka Mancap), the Mansour Group's private investment subsidiary, is based in London and is run by Loutfy Mansour, son of Mohamed Mansour.

Biography  Nihat Hatipoƒülu was born in Diyarbakƒ±r on 11 May 1955. He completed his primary education in Malatya and Kayseri. He studied in an Imam-Hatip High School and graduated from Ankara University.  Criticism  It was claimed that Nihat Hatipoƒülu was receiving 600,000 monthly for his program, which was broadcast on ATV during Ramadan in 2014, and lived in a villa with a pool. Hatipoƒülu responded to the rumors by saying, \\"I have been living in the same house in Ke√ßi√∂ren for 20 years. I have neither a villa, nor a pool, nor a pit in front of my house that can get filled with water during rainfall. The claim that I received 600 thousand per month from ATV is a lie.\\" In August 2014, Turkey's first atheism association Ateizm Derneƒüi filed a criminal complaint with allegations of inciting hatred and hostility and marginalization against Hatipoƒülu following his remarks on an ATV program, during which he said: \\"The greatest father to atheists is the devil, meaning that the devil is actually much cleaner than they are.\\" Hatipoƒülu stated in his defense that he had in fact \\"displayed an embracing attitude towards atheists\\". The prosecutor's office rejected the case on the grounds that the statements were not intended for individuals but for ideas. In May 2019, Hatipoƒülu made a 13-year-old Christian Armenian child a Muslim during the iftar program on ATV. Hatipoƒülu claimed that he had the permission of the child's family for this, while the family's friends said that the children were supposed to go to an outdoor program to eat dinner. The incident sparked reactions and criticism about violating children's rights.

Service Mohawk was a French privateer launched in 1805 that the British captured on 17 March 1806. The citizens of Saint Christopher Island purchased her and presented her to the Navy,. On 15 August 1806 Lieutenant John Tancock was promoted to Commander into Saint Christopher.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 3 pp.28-29. He commissioned her that month in Antigua. He would remain her commander until late in 1808. At some point, probably in December, Lieutenant Andrew Hodge took temporary command of St Christopher. At daylight on 2 January 1807, Saint Christopher was under Hodge's command and about three miles off Saint Bartholomew's when she encountered and gave chase to three French privateers. They separated, with the result that she could only capture one. The prize turned out to be the sloop Entreprenante, of one small gun and seventeen men. The two other privateers escaped into Great Bay, St. Martin's. Tancock had returned to command of Saint Christopher by 18 July when she captured the schooner Henrietta Adelaide, Lind, master. Then on 12 September St Christopher captured the schooner Julia and Sally, De Gasy, master. On 6 October St Christopher captured the Danish schooner Speculator. Next, St Christopher served in the squadron under Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, in , that was sent to occupy the Danish West Indies. The actual occupation of the Danish West Indies did not occur until 7 December, after receipt of news of the second battle of Copenhagen. Late in 1808, a bad attack of yellow fever forced Tancock to return to Britain. A biography credited him with having captured several small Spanish vessels, detained a Danish ship that was condemned as a droit of admiralty, and recaptured a British vessel that had been carrying bale goods from Glasgow to St Thomas's. Lieutenant Francis Alexander Halliday received promotion to Commander on 29 August 1808,Marshall (1832), Vol.3, Part 2, p.369. and took command of St Christopher in September. He was her captain on 27 November when she captured Exchange. In September 1809, Commander Smith replaced Halliday. However, Admiral Cochrane appointed Henry Nathaniel Rowe acting commander of St Christopher on 19 December; the appointment was confirmed in May 1810.O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 3, p.1010. In May Rowe transferred to Asp, then under the command of Commander William M'Culloch.Winfield (2008), p 318.

Chuckwagon racing is a family affair. Sutherland was inspired by his father, who was an amateur racer and other members of the family who competed.  Career  He has been competing in chuckwagon racing since 1967. Sutherland was 14 when he started racing. He was 22 when he won his first race. He can recall being on stage for the first time for an audience of 40,000. \\"When you're in the sport, you only dream about getting the opportunity to win and I was fortunate when I was young.\\" He was an outrider for the first year, then began driving in 1968. His rookie season in the WPCA was 1969. He competed in the 2016 Calgary Stampede Rangeland Derby. In 2010, Sutherland won the chuckwagon championship for the 11th time, breaking the world record. He was almost 60 years old when he won his final and 12th world championship. He also has a dozen championships from the Calgary Stampede, nine championships from the Ponoka Stampede, and one from his hometown of Grande Prairie. He won his 12th and final world championship not long before his birthday in 2017. The year 2017 was his last year competing, as the event has a mandatory retirement age of 65.

It is located about 2,020 light-years (620 parsecs) away from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. The planet was previously proposed in 2012 when reports of its host star recorded drops in its luminosity varying from 0.2% to 1.3%, which indicated a possible planetary companion rapidly disintegrating. In 2015, the planetary nature of the cause of the dips was finally verified. It is expected to disintegrate in about 40‚Äì400 million years. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= The mass of Kepler-1520b is unknown however modeling of the mass loss rate of the planet indicates that the planet cannot be more massive than about 2% the mass of the Earth (less than double the mass of the Moon). According to calculations, it may have lost 70% of its original mass; we may be currently observing its naked iron core. From attempts to measure the secondary eclipse the radius of the planet is constrained to be less than one Earth radius (4600 km) for an albedo of 0.5. It has a surface temperature of , far hotter than the surface of Venus. =Host star= The planet orbits a (K-type) star named Kepler-1520. The star has a mass of 0.76 and a radius of 0.71 . It has a temperature of 4677 K and is 4.47 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 16.7. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Orbit= Kepler-1520b orbits its host star with about 14% of the Sun's luminosity with an orbital period of slightly over 12 hours and an orbital radius of about 0.01 times that of Earth's (compared to the distance of Mercury from the Sun, which is about 0.38 AU). This is one of the closest orbital periods detected yet. Remaining lifetime Kepler-1520b orbits so close to its host star that it is essentially evaporating into space via sublimation, losing about 0.6 to 15.6 Earth mass's per billion years. Based on predictions made by scientists, Kepler-1520b will cease to exist in about 40‚Äì400 million years. Calculations of mass loss rates show that the planet probably had a mass slightly smaller than Mercury in size when it first formed, since the calculations show that planets with masses larger than 7% the Earth's barely lose any mass over billion year time-scales. This discovery helps shed light on how the Earth will interact with the Sun when it becomes a red giant, roughly 5‚Äì7 billion years from now. Discovery =2012 detections= The existence of the planet was first evidenced in data collected by the Kepler spacecraft in 2012. However, the light curve of the star, a graph of its stellar flux versus time, showed that while there were regular drops in stellar flux approximately every 15 hours, the amount of light being blocked covered a wide range, from 0.2% to 1.3% of the starlight being blocked. Saul Rappaport and collaborators proposed various possible phenomena which may have caused the anomalies in the light curve, including two planets orbiting each other, and an eclipsing binary orbiting the star in a larger triple-star system. However, the authors found the hypothetical binary planet system to be unstable and the latter scenario to be poorly supported by the data collected by Kepler. Therefore, the authors posited that the most likely cause of the observed light curve was a closely orbiting planet, about twice the mass of Mercury, which was rapidly emitting small particles into independent orbits around the star. Exactly the cause of this phenomenon could be the direct sublimation of the planetary surface and its emission into space, the intense volcanism caused by the tidal effects of orbiting extremely close to the host star, or both processes mutually reinforcing the strength of each other in a positive feedback loop. =2016 confirmation= Following a campaign of observations using William Herschel Telescope, another group of astronomers was able to detect color dependence of the transit depth, providing independent, direct evidence in favor of this object being a disrupting low-mass rocky planet, feeding a transiting dust cloud. In the new database released by Kepler in May 2016, the planetary nature of then-KIC 12554578 b was confirmed, and was then upgraded to the name Kepler-1520 b.

Down in Houston discusses the African-American musical culture that was established in Houston, Texas, particularly that of the Third Ward and Fifth Ward. Larry Willoughby of Austin Community College described the book as \\"an oral history, a socio-cultural study, a beautifully photographed pictorial, and a musicologist's primary source bonanza.\\"Willoughby, p. 491. Development Wood, who taught English classes at Houston Community College (HCC) Central College since his relocation to Houston in the early 1980s, \\\\- See index for volume 4 issue 1 decided to study blues music when he decided that, in his words, \\"formed the primal headwaters of a cultural river that I had been swimming in for years\\" (page 5). His interest was piqued when he read a 1982 Houston Chronicle article about the death of musician Lightning Hopkins and realized that the church which held the funeral was in proximity to his workplace. Therefore the time from the conception of the idea to publication of the book was about twenty years. The work on the book itself took around ten years,Beeth, p. 208. Wood began partnering with Fraher in 1995. There were about 150 hours worth of interviews used in researching the book. Contents The book, printed on glossy paper, uses a large page format and has photographs of various Houston musicians and musical venues; there are over 100 photographs, many of them black-and-white,Willoughby, p. 491-492. and some of them period pieces. The book does not have footnotes. It chronicles how different kinds of Blues music resulted from class differences, and the book discusses blues performers of both genders.Willoughby, p. 492. Houston natives and people from other cities who moved to Houston and developed their music there are described in the book.Cunningham. There are a total of seven chapters. The opening of the book discusses Lightnin' Hopkins, and other artists such as Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, Gatemouth Brown, Albert Collins, Johnny Copeland, Clifton Chenier, Miss LaVelle, and Katie Webster are discussed. It also tracks the evolution of Houston blues and the national prominence of the Duke-Peacock recording company and head Don Robey; the book argued that Robey's abilities to record and sell blues music helped establish rock and roll music in the United States. Bill Cunningham of Texas Books in Review stated that \\"the most entertaining portion\\" of Down in Houston was the discussion of contemporary blues musicians, even though blues music had declined in Houston and throughout the U.S. by then. Reception Howard Beeth of Texas Southern University concluded that the \\"richly textured\\" Down in Houston \\"is in the tradition of valuable documentary work pioneered by John A. Lomax\\" and that the book \\"is a substantial addition to the good, hard work\\" done on the cultural history and music of African-Americans in Texas.

It was constructed in the years 1855 through to 1859, by John Brown of Thorold, Ontario, under the authority of the Province of Canada and is recognized as one of the six Imperial Towers. Virtually identical, they were completed in 1858-1859 on Lake Huron and Georgian Bay and are among the few lighthouses on the Great Lakes made of cut limestone and granite (not brick, metal, wood or concrete). This lighthouse was planned in about 1850 because underwater shoals of massive granite boulders made navigation in the area dangerous. There are many accounts from the 1800s on of disasters and lost lives in this area of Lake Huron. The first beacon on the island (1857) was provided by a temporary fixed light which was replaced by the tower. The actual lighthouse was first lit on 1 April 1859. Valuable in its day, it still emits a bright beam, but now, buoys and modern navigational tools are more important for safe navigation. The tower and the keeper's dwelling have been extensively restored. The dwelling is listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places while the Lightstation Tower is listed on the National Historic Sites of Canada. However, because the island is a bird sanctuary, only one company has a license to offer tours of the property and only on a limited basis. All other access to the island is prohibited. History and design The origin of the Imperial designation is not certain, but some historians speculate that because the towers were public construction built under the colonial administration while Canada was a self-governing colony of Britain, the name would assure at least some funding from the British Empire's Board of Trade. All six Imperial towers on Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, along with a limestone lightkeeper's dwelling, were constructed by John Brown, a contractor and stonemason from Thorold, Ontario. The Chantry tower's Fresnel lens The tower on Chantry Island is tall, with a focal plane height of . It is made of limestone reinforced with lumber, and the top section is made of granite for extra rigidity. There are 115 steps from the bottom to the lantern room. According to the Heritage Character Statement from the Government of Canada, the tower's design is very strong. The report discusses the \\"magnificent twelve-sided polygonal lantern\\" and the various ornate features. The gallery at the top is a round tapered and corbelled base that houses the 12-sided polygonal Fresnel lantern, which includes three rows of rectangular glass panes. The Fresnel lens was originally developed for lighthouses by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. All of the lenses for the Imperial Towers were manufactured by the Louis Saulter Company of Paris. The powerful (second-order) lens was installed by specialist workmen from France. In 1859, Sperm oil was burned to illuminate the lamps but in 1860, a switch was made to colza oil since it was less expensive and more reliable in the coldest weather. The light was fully automated in 1954; the second-order Fresnel lens remained in use and emits a single white flash every four seconds. Currently, the light is solar powered and operates under the control of the Canadian Coast Guard. The Government of Canada is the owner of the light station. The lightkeepers The keeper was required to maintain the property, clean and whitewash the tower as required, and maintain the light. In the years before electricity and automation, he was also required to carry the fuel up the stairs in buckets, and, twice a day, to wind up the clockwork- like mechanism‚Äîwith weights and pulleys‚Äîthat enabled the weights to rotate the lens. In 1875, the Chantry station's keeper was paid a salary of $400, according to House of Commons records. The following individuals were the keepers of the lightstation over the years: * Duncan McGregor Lambert, 1858‚Äì1880 * William McGregor Lambert, 1880‚Äì1907 * Malcolm McIver, 1908‚Äì1916 * John Klippert, 1917‚Äì1937 * Clayton Knetchel, 1937‚Äì1941 * Alfred Huber, 1941 * Cameron Spencer, 1942‚Äì1954 Before the lightstation's completion and opening, Robert Mills cared for the temporary fixed light for the previous season. In August 1892, William McGregor Lambert, the son of the first lightkeeper, was recognized by the Canadian Government for his lifesaving efforts after the schooner Nettie Woodward capsized. He was credited with the rescue of 20 people, was awarded a gold watch and a bronze medal for his heroic efforts. After he became the keeper, Lambert developed Chantry Island Lightstation Tower and the island as a visitor showplace with one of the first marine museums on the Great Lakes. On retiring, he received the Imperial Service Medal. Historic designation Chantry Island lighthouse and keeper's cottage, after the renovations, from the licensed tour boat The Chantry lighthouse is a significant landmark. It was built at a time when commercial shipping traffic was increasing on the Great Lakes between Canada and the U.S. because of new trade agreements and the opening of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal locks in 1855. The Bruce Peninsula was also open to settlement by 1850, making the lighthouses timely. The other Imperial Towers were also built in the same era, including the nearby Point Clark Lighthouse, to act as navigational aids for the ships. Like those, the Chantry tower was made primarily of cut stone with a functional design that is simple but elegant and pleasing to the eye. The tower first became one of the National Historic Sites of Canada on 14 November 1991, when it was designated as a Classified Federal Heritage Building in the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations. The relevant documents discuss its historical, architectural and environmental value. It was formally listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places, (reference # 4463), on 22 July 2005. The restored lightkeeper's dwelling, resembling a traditional Scottish stone cottage, was recognized as historic in 2009 and formally listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places on 12 February 2014. Like the three other lighthouses in Saugeen Shores, Ontario, this station was nominated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. The other three were subsequently designated as protected under the Act in 2012. The Chantry Island site has yet to be designated. The Act requires ownership of a light station to be first transferred from the federal government to another entity, such as the Town, which did take over ownership of the other lighthouses. That transfer has not occurred because of the uncertainty created by First Nations land claims to islands in the Lake Huron basin.http://www.turtleisland.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?p=2116 In the meantime, the Chantry Island light station is leased to the Town and sublet to the Marine Heritage Society. The lightkeeper's cottage The lightkeeper's dwelling is considered a familiar landmark on its own merits, while being a supportive functional role to the lighthouse tower. The -storey 19th-century residence has a slate-clad gable roof, stone walls, parapet roof ends and stout chimneys and stands adjacent to the tower. The building had a simple interior design featuring a symmetrical three-bay facade, with a central door, flanking windows with two smaller gable end windows, a small vestibule, with interior doors to both the left and right, a wooden staircase that leads directly upstairs to two loft bedrooms positioned on the right, with a single large room with living area and kitchen, to the left a parlour with a small bedroom which reflected the Classic British influence. This design was more spacious than most frontier homes, which showed the importance of the occupants; the dwelling provided a good example of the traditional Scottish cottage of the 18th and early 19th century. After automation of the lighthouse in 1954, the keeper's dwelling collapsed. Between 1997 and 2001 the dwelling was restored by the Marine Heritage Society; the craftsmanship and materials for the restoration are considered very good. To complete restorations, 31 giant hemlock trees were harvested, milled and transported to the island as commercial wood was not available. The walls of the dwelling were rebuilt by mason Bill Robinson, hemlock lumber was used to construct new floors, the loft and the roof. Included in the restoration was the rebuilding of the boat house, restored privy and the planting of historic gardens. The site has evolved from a keeper's home to a farmstead to a tourist attraction; the dwelling changed through restoration and construction with the removal of building additions. In August 2001, a grand opening for the restored lightkeeper's dwelling was held on the island recognizing over 300,000 hours of labour and over 250 volunteers for their dedication and work. Associated with the establishment of the Southampton village in Ontario, the lightstation played a key role in the growth of the port, with the keeper's dwelling recognized as a heritage asset by the municipality of Saugeen Shores. In the years after work on the cottage was completed (2001), subsequent restoration work was done on the property. Volunteers restored the stairs inside the lighthouse tower as well as the keeper's privy and have added a boathouse and a replica boat. Tourism Because Chantry Island is a Federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary, only a single company, the Marine Heritage Society, has a permit to operate tours of the lighthouse and the keeper's dwelling; such visitors must not leave the lightstation property. The tours run several times a week (using a small boat) from late-May to mid-September, leaving from the ticket office by the fishing boat docks. Otherwise, no access to the island is permitted. The Bruce County Museum and Cultural Centre in Southampton, Ontario has some artifacts and archival material about the Chantry lightstation in its collection. Some of it is included in a permanent exhibit, Captivating Coastline.

Shortly after a tweet was sent by President Donald Trump on July 14th telling four female, minority, first-term Congressional representatives to ‚Äúgo back‚Äù to their countries of origin, Mitchell called a fellow House GOP leader and asked him to persuade Trump to cease his rhetoric.

Later, when he was removed from power by the Ottomans, he fled to Safavid Iran, where he served at the Safavid court until his death, and continued to claim the title of atabeg of Samtskhe. Biography Manuchar was the son of Kaikhosro II Jaqeli by his wife Dedisimedi, and served as the regent of Samtskhe between 1576‚Äî1578. He was married to a daughter of Simon I of Kartli, named Elene (fl. 1583‚Äì1609). During his regency, he sided with the Ottomans. Manuchar II was present at the Battle of √áƒ±ldƒ±r, where he watched the Ottomans win from a nearby mountaintop. After the battle ended, Manuchar descended, and handed over the keys of the nearby castles, while at the same time he looked on the thousands of captured men of the combined Safavid- Georgian army being executed on the spot. Subsequently, the Ottomans took the rest of Samtskhe, and divided it into eight sanjaks. Manuchar II was appointed head of one these sanjaks, that of Khakhuli. Later, when the Ottomans found themselves stalled in Kartli due to the fierce resistance of Simon I (Shahnavaz Khan), Manuchar and the rest of his family were brought to Erzurum by Lala Mustafa Pasha. There, Manuchar offered the Ottomans his support if they were to take Shirvan, as long as Samtskhe would be kept semi-autonomous. The Ottomans however refused, and appointed Manuchar's brother Kvarkvare IV as the new atabeg of Samtskhe. Manuchar subsequently travelled to the Ottoman court in Istanbul, converted to Islam, adopted the name Mustafa, and was appointed pasha of Akhaltsikhe in 1579 by the Ottomans, though he was not yet in control of it. In 1581, he drove his older brother Qvarqvare IV away, who had been ruling Samtskhe as a puppet of his \\"imperious\\" mother Dedisimedi since his father's death in 1573, and ruled eastern Samtskhe as pasha of Childir. Even though Manuchar, now known as Mustafa Pasha, chose to support the Ottomans, he had a double agenda, and maintained secret communications with the Georgian nobility, and especially with Simon I, who, after his initial struggle against Safavid Iran, actively fought against the Ottoman encroachment and expansion in Georgia. At the Mukhrani Field, an Ottoman force aided by Manuchar as well as men from Guria, Mingrelia and Imereti, fought the Safavid-Georgian force of Simon I and Ali-Qoli Khan, and were defeated. Manuchar was subsequently blamed for the catastrophe, and a military council discussed the option of having him executed. Aware of the dangerous situation, Manuchar got involved in a deadly skirmish while asking for new orders in the tent of the pasha of Tbilisi, who had taken refuge in Samtskhe. The pasha was badly wounded, and the Ottomans retreated from Samtskhe to Kars shortly after. Manuchar subsequently renounced Islam and joined Simon I's anti-Ottoman efforts. Dismayed, the Ottomans appointed another Muslim Georgian to rule Samtskhe, but soon after the Ottoman sultan sent apologies to Manuchar, and re-confirmed him as atabeg in 1582, which he were to stay till 1585. In the ensuing years, Manuchar assisted Simon in several battles against the Turks, including the battle near the Khrami river. In 1587, the Ottoman sultan planned to deal once and for all with the issue related to Simon I and Manuchar II of Samtskhe; one of his armies took Akhaltsikhe, which Manuchar was unable to defeat. Manuchar subsequently fled to Iran, where he served at the Safavid court until his death in 1614. In 1590, in order to buy time, the Safavids decided to recognize all of Georgia as an Ottoman possession, which therefore also sealed Samtskhe's fate for the time being. When in 1608 Luarsab II of Kartli gained the Iranian approval to attack the Ottomans in Samtskhe, the war was prompted by Manuchar II's wife Elene. She hoped to see her son become the next atabeg of Samtskhe, with Iranian and Kartlian help. This would eventually be accomplished, and their son succeeded as Manuchar III.

Haney was nominated as U.S. Ambassador to Costa Rica by President Barack Obama on July 8, 2014, and was confirmed by the full Senate on May 23, 2015. He served until July 15, 2017, having been the only Obama- appointed political ambassador in the world allowed to stay under the Donald Trump administration. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Haney grew up in Naperville, Illinois, and graduated from Georgetown University, earning a B.S. in international economics and an M.S. in international business and diplomacy from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, Washington, D.C., 1986-1991.  Early years  Haney was born in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1986, he graduated from Naperville Central High School. Haney received his B.S. in international economics in 1990 and his M.S. in international business diplomacy in 1991, both from Georgetown University. After graduating, Haney moved to Latin America to work for a number of U.S. multinationals in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Central America, and Brazil. After nearly a decade in Latin America, he moved to Israel, where he met his future wife, Rabbi Andrea Haney. The couple moved back to the United States in 2002 and settled in Englewood, New Jersey.  Latin America and strategic marketing  Haney started his professional life working for Procter & Gamble in San Juan, Puerto Rico in what was then called the brand management (marketing) department. Haney spent three years at P&G; Puerto Rico working in the laundry and food & beverage sectors. He left P&G; in 1994 as an assistant brand manager. In 1994, Haney moved to PepsiCo Restaurants International, where he worked as a marketing manager for Puerto Rico. In 1995, the company moved him to Mexico City to become the marketing manager for Mexico and Central America. During his time in Mexico, Haney was part of the team which developed a new line of lower cost pizzas, Pizza Mia, in response to the currency and economic crisis. The line has since been launched globally. In 1996, Pepsico Restaurants promoted Haney to be marketing director for Brazil. He was responsible for marketing and strategy for the entire PepsiCo Restaurants business in the country covering both brands, Pizza Hut and KFC, as well as franchise relations. Haney relaunched both brands, revamped business strategy and was successful in turning the businesses around. In 1997, Haney became the vice president of marketing and strategic planning for Citibank Mexico in Mexico City. He was charged with developing a strategy for what was then Citibank's third largest consumer business in the world and largest in Latin America after the bank's acquisition of Banco Confia. Haney managed 192 people and a marketing budget of US$31 million.  Conversion to Judaism  Haney was raised Catholic and attended Catholic grade school. At Georgetown University, he participated in Catholic retreat programs and regularly attended mass. Upon moving to Mexico for the second time, Haney started studying Judaism one-on-one with an Orthodox rabbi. After 18 months of study, Haney decided to take a leave of absence from Citibank and move to Israel to participate in the WUJS (Worldwide Union of Jewish Students) program in Arad, Israel. Prior to moving to Israel, Haney spent time in his hometown of Chicago, where he attended the Anshe Emet Synagogue, eventually converting to Judaism under Conservative Judaism auspices. Once in Israel, Haney continued to study Judaism, both at WUJS in Arad and at the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies, eventually re-converting this time under Orthodox Judaism auspices. Haney has been active in Jewish organizations and served as treasurer, secretary, and co-chair of the Foundation for Jewish Culture, board member of Ayecha (Resource Organization for Jews of Color), member of a modern orthodox synagogue, Kesher, in Englewood/Tenafly, New Jersey and was appointed by President Obama as a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.  Israel and venture capital  After finishing his studies at WUJS (Worldwide Union of Jewish Students), Haney moved to Jerusalem and began working as a senior associate at Israel Seed Partners, then the largest seed-stage venture capital firm in Israel. He managed deal flow and investment analysis for $240 million seed capital fund and was involved in strategy, marketing, and fund-raising activity for $200 million fourth fund. He was the lead investor in Cyota, Inc., and managed the company through subsequent rounds until it was acquired by RSA Security for $145MM, as well as having managed the investment, business development, and subsequent acquisition of location-based services portfolio company NomadIQ by Omnisky (NASDAQ:OMNY).  New York and financial services  In 2002, Haney was recruited to join the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) in New York City as the Director of Strategy and New Business Development. In 2006, Haney began a stint as Senior Vice President of Ethnic Consumer Products at IDT Corporation in Newark, New Jersey. From 2007 to 2015, he was a Principal and Director of Business Development and Client Service (Europe, Middle East and Africa) at Pzena Investment Management in New York City, London and Middle East.  Ambassadorship  On July 8, 2014, President Obama announced his intention to nominate Haney as U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Costa Rica. Haney presented testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 25, 2014 with Senator Tim Kaine presiding over the hearing. He was voted out of committee on September 18, 2014, and his nomination was forwarded to the full Senate. The Senate failed to act on the nomination and it languished to the end of the session. At the end of the session, the nomination was returned to the White House. On February 5, 2015, President Obama once again forwarded Haney's nomination to the Senate. Haney presented testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (for the second time) on March 10, 2015. On May 23, 2015, Haney was confirmed by the full Senate via voice vote, becoming one of only a few nominees confirmed by the Senate. Haney was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Costa Rica on June 1, 2015. and had an official ceremony at the State Department on June 25, 2015. He arrived in San Jose, Costa Rica on June 28, 2015, and presented his credentials to Foreign Minister Manuel Gonzalez on June 30, 2015, and to President Luis Guillermo Solis on July 8, 2015. In January 2017, it was announced that the new Trump administration would require all ambassadors politically-appointed by outgoing President Barack Obama to vacate their posts upon President Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2017. On January 18, 2017, it was announced that Haney had received approval to remain at his post in San Jose, thereby becoming the only politically-appointed ambassadorial holdover from the Obama to the Trump administrations. On July 13, 2017, Haney was awarded the Grand Silver Cross of the National Order of Juan Mora Fern√°ndez by the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica for his meritorious service to the country during his time as US ambassador. Haney ended his service as ambassador on July 15, 2017.  Dancing with the Stars in Costa Rica  On July 28, 2017, it was announced that Haney would be one of the contestants on the fourth season of Dancing with the Stars in Costa Rica (DWTS-CR). DWTS-CR is consistently ranked as the number one non-sports or news related show on Costa Rican television. Haney, known as \\"Mr. Fitz\\" on the show, was paired with Lucia Jimenez, winner of the third season of DWTS-CR (2016) and a global salsa champion. Haney made it to the show's finale, coming in second place with nearly 30% of the public vote. The fourth season of DWTS broke records as to number of votes cast with more than a million votes cast for the finale.  Viola  On November 27, 2017, Haney joined Viola, an Israeli technology- focused investment group with assets under management approaching $3B USD, as a Partner and Head of Strategic Development. Personal life In July 2000, Haney married Andrea Dobrick, who was in 2000 ordained a Conservative Rabbi by the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the American Jewish University (University of Judaism). The couple has four children.

However, by 1978, historians had begun to reexamine the fundamental assumptions of the decline thesis.Howard, Douglas A. \\"Genre and myth in the Ottoman advice for kings literature,\\" in Aksan, Virginia H. and Daniel Goffman eds. The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping the Empire (Cambridge University Press, 2007; 2009), 143. After the publication of numerous new studies throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, and the reexamination of Ottoman history through the use of previously untapped sources and methodologies, academic historians of the Ottoman Empire achieved a consensus that the entire notion of Ottoman decline was a myth ‚Äì that in fact, the Ottoman Empire did not stagnate or decline at all, but rather continued to be a vigorous and dynamic state long after the death of Suleiman the Magnificent. The decline thesis has been criticized as \\"teleological\\", \\"regressive\\", \\"Orientalist\\", \\"simplistic\\", and \\"one-dimensional\\",Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, 4. *Abou-El-Haj, Formation of the Modern State, pp. 3‚Äì4. *Karen Barkey, Bandits and Bureaucrats: The Ottoman Route to State Centralization, (Cornell University Press, 1994), ix. and described as \\"a concept which has no place in historical analysis\\". Scholars have thus \\"learned better than to discuss [it].\\" Despite this dramatic paradigm shift among professional historians, the decline thesis continues to maintain a strong presence in popular history, as well as academic history written by scholars who are not specialists on the Ottoman Empire. In some cases this is due to the continued reliance by non- specialists on outdated and debunked works, and in others to certain political interests benefiting from the continued perpetuation of the decline narrative.Dana Sajdi refers on the one hand to nationalists in post-Ottoman regions of the world, and on the other, to the supporters of imperialistic intervention in the Middle East among some politicians in the West.  Origins of the decline thesis  Sultan Suleiman I, whose reign was seen as constituting a golden age. = In the Ottoman Empire = The first attributions of decline to the Ottoman state came from Ottoman intellectuals themselves.Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, 3. Beginning much earlier, but greatly expanding during the seventeenth century, was the literary genre of nasihatname, or \\"Advice for Kings.\\"Howard, \\"Genre and Myth,\\" pp. 137‚Äì139. This genre had a long history, appearing in earlier Muslim empires such as those of the Seljuks and Abbasids. Nasihatname literature was primarily concerned with order and disorder in state and society; it conceptualized the ruler as the embodiment of justice, whose duty it was to ensure that his subjects would receive that justice. This was often expressed through the concept of the Circle of Justice (). In this conception, the provision of justice by the ruler to his subjects would allow those subjects to prosper, strengthening the ruler in turn.Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, pp. 283‚Äì84. Should this break down, society would cease to properly function. Thus, many Ottomans writing in this genre, such as Mustafa √Çl√Æ,Cornell Fleischer. Bureaucrat and Intellectual in the Ottoman Empire: The Historian Mustafa √Çli, 1541‚Äì1600, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986). described the reign of Suleiman I as the most perfect manifestation of this system of justice, and put forth the idea that the empire had since declined from that golden standard. These writers viewed the changes which the empire had undergone as an inherently negative corruption of an idealized Suleimanic past. However, it is now recognized that rather than simply describing objective reality, they were often utilizing the genre of decline to voice their own personal complaints. For instance, Mustafa √Çli's belief that the empire was declining was in large part motivated by frustration at his own failure to achieve promotions and court patronage.Fleischer, Bureaucrat and Intellectual, 103. The primary goal of the nasihatname writers, then, may have simply been to protect their own personal or class status in a rapidly changing world.Douglas Howard, \\"Ottoman Historiography and the Literature of 'Decline' of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century,\\" Journal of Asian History 22 (1988), pp. 52‚Äì77.Abou-El-Haj, Formation of the Modern State, pp. 20‚Äì40. = In Western Europe = The notion of an all-encompassing Ottoman decline did not enter Western historiography until the early nineteenth century, with the works of historians such as Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall,Joseph von Hammer- Purgstall, Geschichte des Osmanisches Reiches, (in German) 10 vols. (Budapest: Ca. H. Hartleben, 1827‚Äì35). who knew Ottoman Turkish and adopted the idea directly from Ottoman nasihatname writers. Internal decline was thus thought of as an appropriate means of explaining the Ottomans' external military defeats, and acted also as a justification for European imperialism.Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, pp. 3‚Äì4. The notion of a declining Ottoman/Islamic civilization was thus used as a foil for Western Civilization, in which the \\"decadent\\" Ottomans were contrasted with the \\"dynamic\\" West. Islam (as an all-encompassing civilizational category) often came to be portrayed as the polar opposite of the West, whereby Western societies valued freedom, rationality, and progress while Islam valued servility, superstition, and stagnation. Such depictions were perpetuated in the mid-twentieth century above all by the works of H.A.R. Gibb and Harold Bowen, and Bernard Lewis, who adhered to a civilizational conception of Islamic decline while modifying it with the new sociological paradigm of Modernization Theory. These views came under increasing criticism as historians began to reexamine their own fundamental assumptions about Ottoman and Islamic history, particularly after the publication of Edward Said's Orientalism in 1978.Howard, \\"Ottoman Advice for Kings,\\" pp. 143‚Äì44; Edward Said, Orientalism, (New York: Pantheon, 1978).  Tenets  Bernard Lewis, one of the decline thesis' most famous proponents. The most prominent writer on Ottoman decline was the historian Bernard Lewis,Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, 2. who argued that the Ottoman Empire experienced all-encompassing decline affecting government, society and civilization. He laid out his views in the 1958 article, \\"Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire,\\"Bernard Lewis, \\"Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire,\\" Studia Islamica 1 (1958) 111‚Äì127. which developed into the mainstream opinion of Orientalist scholars of the mid- twentieth century. However, the article is now highly criticized and no longer considered accurate by modern historians.Tezcan, Second Ottoman Empire, 242n. * Hathaway, \\"Problems of Periodization.\\" * Darling, \\"Another Look at Periodization.\\" * Quataert, \\"Ottoman History Writing.\\" * Suraiya Faroqhi, Approaching Ottoman History: An Introduction to the Sources, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) 180. Lewis' views were as follows: The first ten sultans of the Ottoman Empire (from Osman I to Suleiman the Magnificent) were of excellent personal quality, while those who came after Suleiman were without exception \\"incompetents, degenerates, and misfits,\\" a result of the Kafes system of succession, whereby dynastic princes no longer gained experience in provincial government before coming to the throne. Faulty leadership at the top led to decay in all branches of government: the bureaucracy ceased to function effectively, and the quality of their records worsened. The Ottoman military lost its strength and began to experience defeats on the battlefield. They ceased to keep up with the advances of European military science, and consequently suffered territorial losses. As the Ottoman state and society was geared towards constant expansion, their sudden failure to achieve new conquests left the empire unable to adapt to its new relationship with Europe. Economically, the empire was undermined by the discovery of the New World and the subsequent shift in the economic balance between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Europe, as well as the voyages of discovery which brought Europeans to India, and led to a decline in the volume of trade passing through Ottoman ports. In addition, the Price Revolution led to the destabilization of Ottoman coinage and a severe fiscal crisis, which proved disastrous when paired with the rapidly rising costs of warfare. As the cavalry army of the Ottomans became obsolete, the Timar System of land tenure which had sustained it fell into obsolescence, while the corrupt bureaucracy was unable to replace it with a functional alternative. Instead, tax-farming was introduced, leading to corruption and oppression of the peasantry, and agricultural decline. Ottoman economic and military backwardness was extenuated by their closed-mindedness and unwillingness to adopt European innovations, as well as an increasing disdain for practical science. Ultimately, the Ottoman Empire \\"reverted to a medieval state, with a medieval mentality and a medieval economy ‚Äì but with the added burden of a bureaucracy and a standing army which no medieval state had ever had to bear.\\"Lewis, \\"Some Reflections,\\" pp. 112‚Äì127. Significantly, explanations of Ottoman decline were not limited to the empire's geopolitical position among world empires or to its military strength. The decline thesis was rooted in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century conception of distinct \\"civilizations\\" as units of historical analysis, and thus explained Ottoman weakness with reference not only to its geopolitics but also defined it in social, economic, cultural, and moral terms. This all-encompassing notion of the decline of Ottoman (and more widely, Islamic) civilization became the framework within which Ottoman history from the sixteenth century onward was understood.  Criticism of the thesis  =Conceptual issues= Dana Sajdi, in an article summarizing the critiques of the decline thesis written since the 1970s, identifies the following as the main points that scholars have demonstrated: \\"1. The changing nature and adaptability of Ottoman state and society; 2. indigenous or internal social, economic, and/or intellectual processes displaying signs of modernity prior to the advent of the West; 3. the comparability of Ottoman state and society with their counterparts in the world in the same period; and 4. a logic, or a framework, alternative to decline and the Eurocentrism implied therein, that takes into account the phenomena of the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries.\\" The first two points pertain to the decline thesis' depiction of Ottoman state and society as being backward-looking, static, and essentially incapable of innovation prior to the 'impact of the West'; the third concerns the degree to which the Ottoman Empire was taken to be totally unique, operating according to its own rules and internal logic, rather than being integrated into a wider comparative framework of world history; while the fourth addresses the degree to which the decline thesis overlooked the local processes actually occurring in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in favor of emphasis on the grand narrative of Ottoman decay and European superiority. In line with these points, a common criticism of the decline thesis is that it is teleological: that is to say that it presents all of Ottoman history as the story of the rise and fall of the empire, causing earlier historians to over-emphasize the empire's troubles and under-emphasize its strengths. According to Linda Darling, \\"because we know that eventually the Ottomans became a weaker power and finally disappeared, every earlier difficulty they experienced becomes a \\"seed of decline,\\" and Ottoman successes and sources of strength vanish from the record.\\"Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, pp. 4‚Äì5. The corollary of decline is the notion that the empire had earlier reached a peak, and this too has been problematized. The reign of Suleiman the Magnificent had been seen as a golden age to which all of the rest of the empire's history was to be compared. Such comparisons caused earlier researchers to see transformation and change as inherently negative, as the empire shifted away from the established norms of Suleiman's romanticized and idealized age. According to Jane Hathaway, this focus on the \\"golden age\\" had a distorting effect on its history: \\"a massive empire that lasted for over six centuries cannot have had an ideal moment and an ideal permutation by which the entire chronological and geographical span of the empire can be judged.\\"Hathaway, \\"Problems of Periodization,\\" 26. Instead, modern scholars take change to be a natural result of the empire's adaptation to the world around it, a sign of innovativeness and flexibility rather than decline. = Political = In reexamining the notion of political decline in the Ottoman Empire, historians first examined the nasihatname texts which had formed the backbone of the decline thesis. Many scholars, among them most notably Douglas HowardDouglas Howard, \\"Ottoman Historiography,\\" pp. 52‚Äì77. and Rifa'at Ali Abou-El-Haj,Abou- El-Haj, Formation of the Modern State, pp. 23‚Äì26. pointed out that these Ottoman writers' critiques of contemporary society were not uninfluenced by their own biases, and criticized earlier historians for taking them at face value without any critical analysis. Furthermore, \\"complaint about the times\\" was in fact a literary trope in Ottoman society, and also existed during the period of the so-called \\"golden age\\" of Suleiman the Magnificent.Cemal Kafadar, \\"The Myth of the Golden Age: Ottoman Historical Consciousness in the post-S√ºleymanic Era,\\" in S√ºleyman the Second [sic] and His Time, eds. Halil ƒ∞nalcƒ±k and Cemal Kafadar (Istanbul: ISIS Press, 1993), pp. 44. For Ottoman writers, \\"decline\\" was a trope which allowed them to pass judgement on the contemporary state and society, rather than a description of objective reality. Thus, these works should not be taken as evidence of actual Ottoman decline.Rhoads Murphey, \\"The Veliy√ºddin Telhis: Notes on the Sources and Interrelations between Ko√ßu Bey and Contemporary Writers of Advice to Kings,\\" Belleten 43 (1979), pp. 547‚Äì571.P√°l Fodor, \\"State and Society, Crisis and Reform, in a 15th‚Äì17th Century Ottoman Mirror for Princes,\\" Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 40 (1986), pp. 217‚Äì240. Other tropes of political decline, such as the notion that the sultans ruling after the time of Suleiman I were less competent rulers, have also been challenged.Metin Kunt, \\"Introduction to Part I,\\" 37‚Äì38. The reigns of such figures as Ahmed I,B√∂rek√ßi, \\"Factions and Favorites.\\" Osman II,Tezcan, Second Ottoman Empire. and Mehmed IVMarc Baer, Honored by the Glory of Islam: Conversion and Conquest in Ottoman Europe, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008) (among others) have been re-examined in the context of the conditions of their own respective eras, rather than by inappropriately comparing them with a mythical Suleimanic ideal. Indeed, the very notion of whether Suleiman's reign constituted a golden age in the first place has come into question.Kafadar, \\"The Myth of the Golden Age\\", 37‚Äì48.Kaya ≈ûahin, Empire and Power in the Reign of S√ºleyman: Narrating the Sixteenth-Century Ottoman World, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013) The fact that sultans no longer personally accompanied the army on military campaigns is no longer criticized, but seen as a positive and necessary change resulting from the empire's transformation into a sedentary imperial polity.Hakan T. Karateke, \\"On the Tranquility and Repose of the Sultan,\\" in Christine Woodhead eds. The Ottoman World, (Routledge, 2011), 116. * Leslie Peirce, The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire, (Oxford University Press: 1993), 185. Leslie Peirce's research on the political role of women in the Ottoman dynasty has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the assumption that the so-called Sultanate of Women, in which female members of the dynasty exercised an unusually high degree of power, was in some way either a cause or a symptom of imperial weakness. On the contrary, Ottoman Valide Sultans, princesses, and concubines were successfully able to fortify dynastic rule during periods of instability, and played an important role in dynastic legitimization.Peirce, The Imperial Harem, pp. 267‚Äì285. Furthermore, the importance of the rapidly expanding bureaucracy is now particularly emphasized as a source of stability and strength for the empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, drawing particularly upon the work of Linda Darling.Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, pp. 200‚Äì306.Hathaway, The Arab Lands, 9 Based largely on the work of Ariel Salzmann, the empowerment of regional notables in the eighteenth century has been reinterpreted as an effective form of government, rather than a sign of decline.Donald Quataert, \\"Ottoman History Writing\\", 5. = Military = One of the most enduring claims of the decline thesis was that of the weakness of the Ottoman military in the post-Suleimanic period. Supposedly, the once-feared Janissary Corps became corrupted as they increasingly earned privileges for themselves, gaining the right to marry, sire children, and enroll those children into the corps. Rather than maintaining strict military discipline, they began to take up professions as merchants and shopkeepers in order to supplement their income, thus losing their military edge. However, it is now understood that janissary participation in the economy was not limited to the post-Suleimanic period. Janissaries were engaging in commerce as early as the fifteenth century, without any apparent impact on their military discipline.Cemal Kafadar, \\"On the Purity and Corruption of the Janissaries,\\" Turkish Studies Association Bulletin 15 (1991): 273‚Äì280. Furthermore, far from becoming militarily ineffective, the Janissaries continued to remain one of the most innovative forces in Europe, introducing the tactic of volley fire alongside and perhaps even earlier than most European armies.G√ºnhan B√∂rek√ßi, \\"A Contribution to the Military Revolution Debate: The Janissaries' Use of Volley Fire During the Long Ottoman-Habsburg War of 1593‚Äì1606 and the Problem of Origins.\\" Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 59 (2006): 407‚Äì438. Even greater attention has been given to the changes experienced by the Timar System during this era. The breakdown of the Timar System is now seen not as a result of incompetent administration, but as a conscious policy meant to help the empire adapt to the increasingly monetized economy of the late sixteenth century. Thus, far from being a symptom of decline, this was part of a process of military and fiscal modernization.Tezcan, Second Ottoman Empire, pp. 22‚Äì23.Metin Kunt, The Sultan's Servants: The Transformation of Ottoman Provincial Government, 1550‚Äì1650, (New York: Columbia University Press, 1983) 98.Ariel Salzmann, \\"The Old Regime and the Ottoman Middle East,\\" in Christine Woodhead eds. The Ottoman World, (Routledge, 2011), 412. The army of cavalry which the Timar System had produced was becoming increasingly obsolete by the seventeenth century, and this transformation allowed the Ottomans to instead raise large armies of musket-wielding infantry, thereby maintaining their military competitiveness.Halil ƒ∞nalcƒ±k, \\"Military and Fiscal Transformation in the Ottoman Empire, 1600‚Äì1700,\\" Archivum Ottomanicum 6 (1980): 283‚Äì337. By the 1690s, the proportion of infantry in the Ottoman army had increased to 50‚Äì60 percent, equivalent to their Habsburg rivals.G√°bor √Ågoston, \\"Firearms and Military Adaptation: The Ottomans and the European Military Revolution, 1450‚Äì1800\\". Journal of World History.' 25 (2014): 123. In terms of armament production and weapons technology, the Ottomans remained roughly equivalent with their European rivals throughout most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.Jonathan Grant, \\"Rethinking the Ottoman \\"Decline\\": Military Technology Diffusion in the Ottoman Empire, Fifteenth to Eighteenth Centuries.\\" Journal of World History 10 (1999): 179‚Äì201.G√°bor √Ågoston, \\"Ottoman Artillery and European Military Technology in the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Centuries,\\" Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae 47/1‚Äì2 (1994): 15‚Äì48. The theory that Ottoman cannon foundries neglected mobile field guns by producing oversized siege cannon at a disproportionate rate has been debunked by the military historian G√°bor √Ågoston.G√°bor √Ågoston, Guns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the Ottoman Empire, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) pp. 195‚Äì98. Despite the Orientalistic claim that an inherent conservatism in Islam prevented the Ottomans from adopting European military innovations, it is now known that the Ottomans were receptive to foreign techniques and inventions, and continued to employ European renegades and technical experts throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.√Ågoston, \\"Military Transformation,\\" pp. 286‚Äì87.√Ågoston, Guns for the Sultan, pp. 192‚Äì195. In terms of productive capacity, the Ottomans were even able to surpass their European rivals during the seventeenth century. They maintained full self-sufficiency in gunpowder production until the late eighteenth century, and with rare and brief exceptions were continually able to produce enough cannon and muskets to supply their whole armed forces as well as surplus stockpiles.√Ågoston, Guns for the Sultan, pp. 199‚Äì200. According to G√°bor √Ågoston and Rhoads Murphey, Ottoman defeats in the 1683‚Äì99 and 1768‚Äì74 wars with the Habsburgs and Russia are best explained by the strain on logistics and communications caused by multi-front warfare rather than Ottoman inferiority in technology and armaments, as such inferiority, insofar as it existed at all, was far less significant than had formerly been believed.√Ågoston, Guns for the Sultan, pp. 200‚Äì201.Rhoads Murphey, Ottoman Warfare: 1500‚Äì1700, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1999), 10. It is now believed that the Ottoman military was able to maintain rough parity with its rivals until the 1760s, falling behind as a consequence of a long period of peace on its western front between 1740 and 1768, when the Ottomans missed out on the advances associated with the Seven Years' War. * = Economic and fiscal = Early critiques of the decline thesis from an economic standpoint were heavily influenced by new sociological perspectives of dependency theory and world-systems analysis as articulated by scholars such as Andre Gunder Frank and Immanuel Wallerstein in the 1960s and 1970s. These theories provided an influential critique of the prevailing theory of modernization which was then popular among economists and political analysts, and had been the framework within which Ottoman economic history had been understood, exemplified above all by Bernard Lewis' 1961 The Emergence of Modern Turkey. Modernization theory held that the underdeveloped world was impoverished because its failure to follow Europe in advancing along a series of distinct stages of development (based on the model provided above all by France and Britain), which were assumed to be uniformly applicable to all societies. Historians seeking to identify the factors which prevented the Ottomans from achieving \\"modernization\\" turned to the stereotypes which formed the basis of the decline thesis: an Ottoman penchant for despotism and lethargy which inhibited their entry into the modern world and brought about economic stagnation. Dependency theory, in contrast, viewed modern-day underdevelopment as the product of the unequal global economic system gradually established by Europeans beginning in the early modern period, and thus saw it as the outcome of a historical process rather than a simple inability to adapt on the part of the non-Western world. Dependency theory, introduced into Ottoman history by Huri ƒ∞slamoƒülu-ƒ∞nan and √áaƒülar Keyder, thus allowed historians to move beyond the concepts which had previously dominated Ottoman economic history, above all the notion of an \\"Oriental despotism\\" which supposedly inhibited economic development, and instead to examine the empire in terms of its gradual integration into the periphery of a newly emerging Europe-centered world system. Subsequent provincial studies highlighted the degree to which the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire was undergoing its own capitalist transformation independent of European economic penetration, which in turn facilitated the empire's integration into the world economy. Even following the empire's peripheralization, Ottoman manufacturing, long assumed to have collapsed in the face of European competition, is now understood to have grown and even flourished during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, benefiting from the strength of the Ottoman domestic market. In earlier periods, Ottoman economic and fiscal downturn was associated above all with the catastrophic effects of the price revolution of the late sixteenth century. However, this economic downturn was not unique to the Ottomans, but was shared by European states as all struggled with the diverse pressures of inflation, demographic shifts, and the escalating costs of warfare. By placing the Ottomans in comparative context with their neighbors, scholars have demonstrated that the multiple crises experienced by the Ottomans in the late sixteenth and early-to-mid seventeenth centuries can be seen as part of a wider European context characterized as the 'general crisis of the seventeenth century', rather than a sign of uniquely Ottoman decline. The assumption that the Ottoman economy was unable to recover from these crises was rooted both in the poor state of the field's knowledge of the Ottoman economy in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and also in how easily it seemed to fit with pre- existing ideas about Ottoman decline. However, subsequent research demonstrated that, in the words of ≈ûevket Pamuk, the eighteenth century \\"was in fact a period of recovery for the Ottoman monetary system,\\" indicating that \\"the old thesis of continuous decline cannot be sustained.\\" Far from declining, the first half of the eighteenth century was a period of significant expansion and growth for the Ottoman economy. * Other supposed manifestations of Ottoman economic decline have also been challenged. The establishment by European merchants of new maritime trade routes to India around the Cape of Good Hope, bypassing Ottoman territories, had a far less significant impact on the Ottoman economy than had once been assumed. While earlier scholarship depicted the Portuguese as having established a near- monopoly on the movement of luxury goods, particularly spices, to Europe, in fact the Portuguese were only one of many actors competing in the Indian Ocean commercial arena. Even in the late sixteenth century, Asian merchants utilizing the traditional Red Sea trade routes through Ottoman territory transported four times as many spices as those of Portuguese merchants, and until the early eighteenth century more silver specie continued to be imported into India via the traditional Middle Eastern routes than through the European-dominated Cape route. The loss of revenue which did occur was made up for by the rise in the coffee trade from Yemen during the seventeenth century which, along with strong commercial ties with India, ensured the continued prosperity of Red Sea trade and of Cairo as a commercial center.Faroqhi, \\"Crisis and Change,\\" 507; Jane Hathaway, \\"The Ottomans and the Yemeni Coffee Trade,\\" Oriente Moderno 25 (2006): 161‚Äì171. Historians such as the above- mentioned Bernard Lewis once referred to the supposed fall in the quality of the empire's bureaucratic records as an indication of stagnation in the Ottoman administrative apparatus.Lewis, \\"Some Reflections,\\" 113. Historians now recognize that no such decline ever occurred.Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, pp. 299‚Äì306. This change in record-keeping was attributable not to loss in quality, but to a change in the nature of land assessment, as the empire adjusted to the increasingly monetized economy characteristic of the seventeenth century. The assessment methods in use under Sultan Suleiman were well-suited to ensuring proper distribution of revenues to the army of feudal cavalry that then made up the bulk of Ottoman forces. However, by the turn of the century, the need for cash to raise armies of musket-wielding infantry led the central government to reform its system of land tenure, and to expand the practice of tax farming, which was also a common method of revenue-raising in contemporary Europe. In fact, the seventeenth century was a period of significant expansion in the Ottoman bureaucracy, not contraction or decline.Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, pp. 81‚Äì118.Michael Ursinus, \\"The Transformation of the Ottoman Fiscal Regime, c. 1600‚Äì1850,\\" in Christine Woodhead eds. The Ottoman World, (Routledge, 2011) 423‚Äì434.Tezcan, Second Ottoman Empire, pp. 19‚Äì23. These changes, contrary to the claims of earlier historians, do not seem to have led to widespread corruption or oppression to a degree greater than that observable among the Ottoman Empire's European contemporaries.Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, pp. 246‚Äì80. The Ottomans, like other European states, struggled throughout the seventeenth century to meet rapidly rising expenses, but by its end were able to institute reforms which allowed them to enter the eighteenth century with a budget surplus. In the words of Linda Darling, \\"Ascribing seventeenth-century Ottoman budgetary deficits to the decline of the empire leaves unexplained the cessation of these deficits in the eighteenth century.\\"Darling, Revenue- Raising and Legitimacy, 239.  21st-century scholarly consensus  Having dispensed with the notion of decline, today's historians of the Ottoman Empire most commonly refer to the post-Suleimanic Period, or more widely the period from 1550 to 1700, as one of transformation.Faroqhi, Crisis and Change, 553.Carter Vaughn Findley, \\"Political culture and the great households\\", in Suraiya Faroqhi eds., The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603‚Äì1839, volume 3 of The Cambridge History of Turkey. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 66. The role of economic and political crises in defining this period is crucial, but so too is their temporary nature, as the Ottoman state was ultimately able to survive and adapt to a changing world.Hathaway, Arab Lands, 59.Faroqhi, \\"Crisis and Change,\\" 411‚Äì414. Also of increasing emphasis is the place of the Ottoman Empire in comparative perspective, particularly with the states of Europe. While the Ottomans struggled with a severe economic and fiscal downturn, so too did their European contemporaries. This period is frequently referred to as that of The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century,Geoffrey Parker, Global Crisis: War, Climate Change & Catastrophe in the Seventeenth Century, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013) and thus the difficulties faced by the Ottoman Empire have been reframed not as unique to them, but as part of a general trend impacting the entire European and Mediterranean region.Darling, Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy, pp. 8‚Äì10.Ursinus, \\"The Transformation of the Ottoman Fiscal Regime,\\" 423. In the words of Ehud Toledano, \\"In both Europe and the Ottoman empire, these changes transformed states and the ways in which military-administrative elites waged and funded wars. Coping with these enormous challenges and finding the appropriate responses through a sea of socio-economic and political changes is, in fact, the story of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Ottoman history. A remarkable adaptation to new realities, rather than decline and disintegration, was its main feature; it reflects the resourcefulness, pragmatism and flexibility in thought and action of the Ottoman military- administrative elite, rather than their ineptitude or incompetence. Thus, per Dana Sajdi: \\"Regardless of what one may think of an individual revisionist work, or a particular method or framework, the cumulative effect of the scholarship has demonstrated the empirical and theoretical invalidity of the decline thesis, and offered a portrayal of an internally dynamic Ottoman state and society. It has also established the comparability of the Ottoman empire to other - mainly European - societies and polities, and concomitantly revised the existing scheme of periodization.\\" The 21st-century scholarly consensus on the post-Suleimanic period can thus be summarized as follows:  See also  * Gaza Thesis * Renegade thesis Notes  References   Bibliography  * Abou-El-Haj, Rifa'at A.

System information models are digital representations of connected systems, such as electrical instrumentation and control, power, and communication systems. The objects modelled in a SIM have a 1:1 relationship with the objects in the physical system. Components, connections and functions are defined and linked as they would be in the real world.  Origins  The concept of SIM has existed since the mid 1990s. It was first proposed in 1994 by an Australian instrument, electrical and control system engineering company ‚Äì I&E; Systems Pty Ltd. Like many technological innovations the idea for SIM was born out of necessity. Since the mid-nineties, the complexity of power, control and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems has been growing exponentially due to rapid advances in technology; this has rendered the traditional paper-based methodologies and applications used for system design to become obsolete. The cost of design related activities can be up to 70% of the total project expenditure in an electrical instrumentation and control system (EICS) engineering project. Analyses revealed that the limited nature of paper-based methods/workflows had significant contributions to the high design cost which required duplication of information on multiple documents resulting in design errors and omissions and therefore increasing the cost of labour. With this in mind, the company realized there is a need to shift away from the traditional paper-based methods to a more efficient systematic digital modelling approach. The term 'System Information Modelling' was first published in a technical report in 2012 by Peter E.D. Love and Jingyang Zhou.Love, P.E.D., and Zhou, J. (2012). Documentation Errors in Instrumentation and Electrical Systems: Toward Systems Information Modelling. School of Built Environment for I&E; Systems, SoBE 100/2012, Curtin University, July, Perth, Australia. The report presented empirical evidence to demonstrate that the use of a SIM could potentially improve productivity and reduce the cost to produce EICS documentation. The research examined a set of electrical engineering drawings of an Iron Ore Stacker Conveyor system; errors and omissions identified from the drawings have been classified and quantified. The report concluded that the use of traditional Computer-Aided- Design (CAD) methods to produce electrical engineering design is ineffective, inefficient and costly. Since 2013, a number of scholarly research papers have been published that have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of using a SIM instead of CAD to design and document EICS in a variety of projects (e.g., iron ore processing plant, FPSO safety control system, copper smelter plant, oil refinery, and a geothermal power plant).Love, P.E.D., Matthews, J. and Zhou, J., (2014). Systems Information Model for Asset Management of Electrical, Control, and Instrumentation Systems. BIM Journal 11, pp.10-13  Definition  System Information Modelling can be defined as the process of digitally modelling a complex connected system. A System Information Model is a shared information resource of a system forming a reliable basis of knowledge during its life-cycle.  Throughout the life- cycle  A SIM containing all the project information can be applied throughout the entire life-cycle of the project. = Design = Engineering design and documentation can be undertaken simultaneously when using a SIM. A SIM can be created as the design of an EICS progresses. Draftsman and modellers are no longer required. When a SIM is applied to the design of a connected system, all physical equipment and the associated connections to be constructed can be modelled in a relational database. Components are classified according to 'Type' and 'Location' attributes. The 'Type' attribute is used to define equipment functionalities. The 'Location' attribute is used to describe the physical position of equipment. Connections between equipment are modelled as 'connectors'. To facilitate the design, attributes, such as a device module, specifications and vendor manuals can be assigned and attached to each individual object. When the design process is complete, a read only copy of the model is created, exported and made available to other project team members. The users can access all or part of the design information within the SIM regarding to their respective authorization levels. Private user data can be established and attached to the model. = Procurement and construction = When the design is approved for construction, a SIM, which is a digital realization of the design, can be issued to different parties such as the procurement team and construction contractors. Information management can be achieved digitally and the role of paper drawings is eliminated. The procurement plan and construction schedule can be created for each individual object in the SIM. Construction activities can be assigned to objects or work- packs with weighting factors defined. This enables the managers to be able to track the progresses of the procurement and construction detailed to individual object level and make informed decisions. = Asset management = A SIM is specifically useful for asset managers, as it enables information to be stored in a single digital model. In a traditional CAD-based environment paper drawings are typically handed over to the asset owner in the form of 'As Built' drawings, which reflect, in theory, the actual construction of every system, component and connection of a project. If an asset manager wants to maintain, repair or upgrade any portion of the asset, then the 'As Built' drawings need to be used. However, recovering information contained on an array of drawings is a tedious and time consuming task. Any error or omission contained within the drawings will potentially hinder the interpretation of the design. When engineering is undertaken using a SIM it can be stored in a digital format whereby a 1:1 mapping is undertaken. Operations such as test, calibration, inspection, repair, minor change and isolation can be defined and scheduled within the SIM. The SIM data can also be conveniently exported and input into other third party asset management applications to comply with the owners' asset management strategy. In addition, the SIM can act as a training tool, which can be used regularly to assist operators to become familiar with the design.  Software  A commercial proprietary software package, Digital Asset Delivery (DAD), has been developed based on the concept of System Information Modelling (SIM) by I&E; Systems Pty Ltd. The initial version of DAD was released in 1997 which was primarily a modelling tool used to design and document the electrical engineering system. Since it was born, DAD has been tested and applied to many projects including but not limited to greenfield and brownfield, power, control and ICT systems. The DAD software has been continuously maintained and upgraded to cater for complex and rapid changing EICS projects. The latest release of DAD is version 13. DAD provides several facilities to capture the complexities of today's systems including: LAYERS (e.g. Assembly (Physical): How is it built?, Control (Functional): How does it work? etc.), RELATIONSHIPS - links between components on different layers, GROUPS - components and connectors with common features. DAD works closely with its partner application ActivityExchange which builds upon the power of the digital model to allow users to define, organise, track and exchange work to be done on any project. Once completed, each distinct record of work can be appended in to the digital model for future reference and historical continuity. ActivityExchange manages real-time workflows of all human interaction with system components including design review, procurement, construction, commissioning and finally maintenance.  International development  The concept of SIM has been applied and verified in a number of international projects. = Australia = There are a number of Australian- based organisations in various industry sectors benefitting from SIM technology. A few examples: Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) based in Western Australia has adopted SIM for all their projects built since 2010. These projects include the large scale Solomon Iron Ore project, the expansion of their export port facility and the North Star magnetite project. FMG acknowledges that using SIM on these projects resulted in large savings and more efficient project execution and that it continues to provide benefits for the operation of these facilities. Opticomm builds, owns and operates a large fibre optic communications network which connects tens of thousands of residential and commercial properties. Their network is totally modelled using SIM and all their construction and operations activities are based on the information in their SIM based information model. In 2016, Perth International Airport adopted the SIM and they had their power distribution network modelled using this technology. The electrical components and cable objects in their SIM are linked to the objects in their geographic information system (GIS). This seamlessly provides full system technical and geographical information about all their electrical system components and cables. Perth Airport has plans to expand the use of SIM to their other connected systems like runway lighting systems, and communication networks. = China = SIM has been applied to model and manage the electrical and communication systems of the Wuhan Metro Stations in China in 2014. In 2016, a SIM model was created to digitize the distributed control system (DCS) of the Wuhan International Expo Centre. Since 2014, a number of research projects have been undertaken by the BIM Centre of Huazhong University of Science and Technology including SIM application, linking SIM to BIM and linking SIM to Engineering Information Modelling (EIM). = Saudi Arabia = In 2015, SIM was applied by a large Japanese Engineering and Construction company to model the electrical and instrumentation systems on a very large new oil refinery project in Saudi Arabia. The SIM was used as the basis for management of all procurement and construction activities through Procurement and Construction Portals. = Europe = In 2018, SIM was applied by a large logistics company in Ireland to model their entire ICT Infrastructure in advance of a significant hardware and software refresh. SIM was used to map the high level business processes of the organisation down to the specific and individual records held in each system by the organisation, assuring migration success to a new ERP as well as providing compliance and assurance on GDPR requirements. The SIM was used as the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) to facilitate the ongoing project activities required to upgrade the organisations technologies and will become an inherent part of their IT operations.  SIM and BIM  System information modelling is different from building information modeling, though both focus on sharing knowledge and information. The process of BIM has been defined as: Building information modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. A BIM is a shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions during its life-cycle; defined as existing from earliest conception to demolition. A SIM is akin to BIM; 'Building' is replaced with 'System' to represent the process of modeling complex connected systems, such as electrical control, power and communications, which do not possess geometry. Essentially, a SIM takes a discipline specific perspective to model complex connected systems, but can be integrated with a building information model when a single point of truth is formed. The traditional way of documenting the design of the connected system is to use 2D drawings that are created by draftsmen and consist of various views that must be used jointly to form an integrated design. As the drawings are created manually and the information for a component could be represented on several different drawings, the propensity for errors, omission, conflicts and duplications to materialize significantly increases. Since the mid 1970s, there has been a trend to replace the traditional manually drafted drawings with computer aided digital drawings. Though efficiencies in creating drawings has been improved since the introduction of CAD, there remains an over reliance on the production of paper based documentation despite the emergence of 'digital' engineering. With the introduction of SIM, productivity benefits can be achieved, particularly during the operations and maintenance of assets for EICS. SIM is not restricted to the EICS, power and communication systems. It can be used to model a variety of connected systems such as network topology, causal loop and interactions between people and organizations. The application scope of SIM is beyond the 'physical facility' that has been defined for BIM, which enables the SIM to be applicable to model both the physical and virtual networks of the connected systems.  Extended applications  A SIM can be linked to Geographical Information Systems to support the management of spatial information. For example, a SIM model with components assigned by coordinates can be linked to Google Earth to show the real physical locations of the components. A SIM can also be linked to third party 3D models, using applications such as Autodesk Navisworks, to gain spatial support and also provide detailed system data to the third parties. Interoperability can be achieved between SIM and a variety of technologies such as image modelling, Google Maps, virtual reality, augmented reality, Quick Response code, and radio-frequency identification.

As Secretary of State, Ashcroft has pushed for stricter voter ID laws. Early life Ashcroft is the son of politician John Ashcroft. Ashcroft attended the United States Merchant Marine Academy, but did not graduate. He earned his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees from Missouri University of Science and Technology. He then worked as an engineer. Ashcroft attended law school, earning his Juris Doctor from Saint Louis University. Political career Ashcroft ran for the Missouri Senate in 2014, losing to Jill Schupp. He ran for Missouri Secretary of State in the 2016 elections. He defeated State Senator Will Kraus in the Republican Party primary election, and former KMOV anchor Robin Smith in the general election. = Voter ID laws = Ashcroft is a staunch supporter of stricter voter ID laws. Ashcroft's claims about voter fraud, as well as the need for photo ID laws to combat voter fraud, were a central aspect of his 2016 campaign for the office of Missouri Secretary of State. He has asserted that voter fraud is common enough to have \\"changed elections.\\" There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Missouri or anywhere else in the United States. The type of voter fraud that would be addressed through Ashcroft's preferred legislation, which critics say suppresses turnout, is extremely rare. In defending a push for stricter photo- ID laws, Ashcroft cited one instance where a couple illegally voted, but omitted that the photo-ID laws that Ashcroft was advocating for would not have prevented the couple from voting. According to the Kansas City Star, \\"there has never been a reported case of voter impersonation fraud in Missouri.\\" In June 2018, Ashcroft said that voter fraud was \\"an exponentially greater threat than hacking.\\" On July 3, 2017, Ashcroft said that he would comply with the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity's request for Missourians voting data. At the time, Missouri became one of only three states to comply with the commission. He said he would give out voters‚Äô names, addresses, birthdates, where they voted and when. =Investigation of Josh Hawley= In December 2018, Ashcroft, who as Secretary of State does not have the power to issue subpoenas, asked Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway, who can issue subpoenas, to cooperate in an investigation of Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley for using public resources in the 2018 United States Senate election in Missouri. This investigation has since ended. = Ballot initiatives = Ashcroft has backed a number of Republican proposals to reduce the number of Missouri ballot initiative petitions and make it harder for ballot initiatives to win approval in elections.

The combo possessed a more polished and professional style than much of their regional contemporaries, reflecting upon influences from gospel and barbershop music. In the Four Fellows' recording career, they underwent multiple line-up changes with lead singer Jimmy McGowan remaining the sole consistent member of the group until it disbanded in 1956. The group released several singles, but their one and only national hit came in 1955, with the distribution of \\"Soldier Boy\\", a Top 10 song on the Billboard R&B; charts. History The group came together in 1953 when David Jones (tenor) and Larry Banks (bass), both of whom had recently returned from combat in the Korean War, convinced Jimmy McGowan (second tenor) to resume his singing career. McGowan had prior time spent with the vocal group the Four Toppers, but was forced to break up the band when he was hospitalized with an illness. With Jimmy Beckum (lead vocalist) also involved, the group formed the Schemers. The band members came from varying backgrounds and influences in the music industry: Beckum sang in the gospel group the Brooklyn Crusaders and Jones and Banks spent time in barbershop acts. After a few public appearances, Beckum left the Schemers, but was soon replaced with Teddy Williams, who McGowan had worked with during his stint with the Four Toppers. Thereafter, the group adopted a style inspired by the Mills Brothers, which emphasized collective vocalization rather than an identifiable frontman backed by harmony singers. By 1954, their manager Jimmy Johnson renamed the Schemers to the Four Fellows, the belief that the changed moniker would sound more professional for their upcoming performance on Ralph Cooper's television program Spotlight on Harlem. Later in the year, Johnson orchestrated a recording contract with Derby Records, leading to the Four Fellows debut single \\"I Tried\\" paired with \\"Bend on the River\\". The single was a commercial disappointment, which lead to the swift ousting of Johnson from his managerial role to be replaced by Teddy \\"Cherokee\\" Conyer, a former saxophonist for Buddy Johnson. An agreement between Conyer and record producer Phil Rose placed the Four Fellows on Rose's newly established label Glory Records. In 1955, the Four Fellows released a paired of singles, \\"I Wish I Didn't Love You\\" and \\"So Will I\\", the latter of which partnered the combo with blues singer Bette McLaurin. Finally, a breakthrough came for the group when Rose, who rejected every other song the Four Fellows offered, choose Jones's composition \\"Soldier Boy\\". In July 1955, \\"Soldier Boy\\" was released, and became a smash R&B; hit, reaching number four on the Billboard R&B; charts, where it lingered for 15 weeks. Following the single's success, the band made regular appearances at the Apollo Theatre and Brooklyn Paramount Theatre, sharing the bill with the Moonglows, the Nutmegs, and Bo Diddley. A tour in the Midwest followed, reaching its peak with a performance at the Regal Theater in Chicago. More singles were released in 1955 and 1956, including \\"Angels Say,\\" \\"In the Rain,\\" \\"Darling You,\\" and \\"Please Play My Song\\", but none of the records neared the commercial success of \\"Soldier Boy\\". For the Four Fellows' final single, \\"You're Still in My Heart\\", the group was accompanied by singer Bessie White, who Banks married. In April 1956, Jones left to work with Hal Miller, and was replaced by Jimmy Mobley in time to appear on the \\"Please Play My Song\\" single. By the end of 1956, McGowan stood alone as the only original member, recruiting Gordon Payne and Alvin Scott to record an album with Josh White before disbanding in 1957. Banks enjoyed success in the music industry as a record producer and songwriter, penning the song \\"Go Now\\" for Bessie White. Although it was not a big hit, a cover version by the Moody Blues reached national audiences in the United States and England. The \\"Soldier Boy\\" line-up performed for the last time together at a benefit for the United in Group Harmony Association (UGHA) in May 1979. In 1980, the UGHA released a live version of \\"Soldier Boy\\" on its own independent label. At the eighth annual UGHA hall of fame event in 1998, McGowan represented the Four Fellows to perform \\"Soldier Boy\\" with the cappela group the Sheps.

He died as a volunteer in the Russian campaign.  Family  After the death of his first wife, Prince Louis of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken married on February 28, 1787 Catherine Kest, former handmaiden of his past mistress Baroness Amalie of Dorsberg. Of middle-class origin, he had been his mistress from 1774. He had her raised in 1774 to the peer status of \\"Lady of Ludwigsberg\\", in 1781 to Baroness and then in 1784 to \\"Countess of Ottweiler\\". To the opposition of the rest of the House of Nassau, Louis had coat of arms ceremoniously conferred upon Catherine, along with the title \\"Princess of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken\\". From their morganatic relationship before 1787 was born six children. Adolph, the seventh, was born their only legitimate child. Prior that year, in April 1789, Prince Louis acquired for her the Duchy of Dillange from King Louis XVI of France. As such, the Saarbr√ºcken baptismal record for Adolph reads \\"Prince of Nassau and Duke of Dillingen\\". The Principality of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken was occupied by French revolutionary troops during the First Coalition War in 1793, and incorporated into the French Republic. The princely family moved to Mannheim and then to Aschaffenburg, where Prince Louis died in exile in 1794. The Hereditary Prince Henry Louis followed him in 1797, leaving no offspring. Only eight years old, Adolph, while the last male survivor of the Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken line, could not inherit the principality, as stipulated in the 30 June, 1783 Nassau Family Pact. Thus the pretension to the principality fell to Charles William, Prince of Nassau-Usingen, his father's cousin. Duchess Catherine and her son resided in Paris from 1802-5. There she attempted to regain their Revolutionary- controlled territories. Childhood portraits of Adolph are located in the Old Collection of the Saarland Museum in Saarbr√ºcken.  Education  In Paris, Adolph studied a Classical education and fencing under a private tutor. At 16, he attended the University of Heidelberg, studying cameralism. He was very active in Heidelberg student life and was initially a member of the Palatia Corps, and then on 25 November, 1805 a member of the Corps Suevia. By March 1807, he had joined the Corps Rhenania and challenged Georg Kloss, member of the Corp Suevia to two games in early 1808. After several university penalties, he received on August 13, 1808 the consilium abeundi. He thus transferred to the University of G√∂ttingen, where he joined George Kloss as co-founder and senior of the Corps Hannovera. He received a suspension in 1809 in the course of the Police Affair, in which many G√∂ttingen students clashed with the police of the Kingdom of Westphalia on 17 August, 1809. From his mother's residence at Mannheim, he continued to correspond with the officially defunct Hannoverians. He continued studies during the summer semester of 1810 at the University of Jena. By winter 1810, he was studying at the University of Erlangen. He joined the Corps Onoldia in November and from January 1811 to his departure in March 1811, he was Consenior of the fraternity. The Corpshaus Hannovera, where Adolph resided as founder of the fraternity  Military career  In March 1811 he joined as a cadet in the army of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg and first attended the Military Academy in Ludwigsburg. In August 1811 he was promoted to Second Lieutenant of the \\"Foot Guards\\" and on February 19, 1812 promoted to Lieutenant of the so-called \\"K√∂nig\\" Jager Battalion. In March he volunteered to Napoleon's Invasion of Russia. On 16 August 1812, during the Battle of Smolensk he was severely wounded by a shot to the shoulder. The ball could be removed after about forty days. He arrived by ambulance on December 9, 1812 to Vilna, where in front of the Gate of Dawn he was run over by a cannon. In temperatures as low as -39 degrees, he was brought to the house of Rabbi Aron, where died of his injuries and frostbite the following night. With his death, the family of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken was extinguished in the male line; He was survived by his mother, two married sisters, wife and daughter. His mother the Duchess Catherine refused to acknowledge his death for years to come. Only when many years later the Tsar invited her to his court in Moscow to inform her that his imperially-ordered investigation had turned up a grave, she resigned herself to the truth.

The book was first published in the United States on October 7, 2014 through Berkley Books and centers around a group of vampires living underground in New York City. In 2016, IM Global announced their intent to develop a television series based on the novel.  Synopsis  The book is told from the viewpoint of Joey Peacock, a self-described unreliable narrator and vampire living in New York City during 1978. Joey was turned into a vampire when he was fourteen years old during the 1930s, by his parents' ex-cook Margaret, who turned him as an act of revenge for framing her for theft and getting her fired. While vampires do not age, their natural state resembles that of a corpse, making it necessary for them to use glamour-esque charm to project the image of life and health to humans and each other. For about the last decade Joey has been living in an abandoned underground part of the city that connects to the subway system with Margaret and several other vampires such as Cvetko, an older looking vampire that is chronologically about the same age as Joey but occasionally treats him like a surrogate son. The group generally works together and lives by a set of rules created by Margaret, who serves as their leader. Joey goes about his undead life in a semi-regular pattern, which includes visiting the skeleton of a young girl he names Chloe in a small passage, that leaves him feeling a little bored with his existence until he witnesses a vampiric child charming a subway patron into leaving with him. He and the others soon discover that there are several such children, all of whom have a hunger for blood that is far larger than that of any of the other vampires. This causes Joey to question if the children are a different type of vampire entirely and the identity of the person who turned them, as turning children is heavily frowned upon by the vampires Joey is aware of. The group suspects that the children were turned by a long lived vampire known as the Hessian, who lives in seclusion elsewhere in the city. A few vampires living in the city, a Hispanic gang that owes obedience to Margaret, launches an unsuccessful attack on the Hessian, only for it to end with the death of almost every gang member. Meanwhile, many of the group's members begin to pity the children, as they're led to believe that they were turned for pedophilic purposes, and secretly feed them their own blood, including Joey. It is eventually revealed that the children have been lying about their past and are far older than they've been leading the others to believe. The children are so old that their true forms are mummified corpses whose stomachs are riddled with holes, making it harder for them to feed, thus explaining their need to constantly feed. The children lied in order to cause chaos within the group and make it easier to kill them in order to take over their lair, a process that they've done on at least one other occasion, per some graffiti found within the lair that says \\"don't trust the children\\". The children kill or chase off every member of the group and initially try to enlist Joey to their side, as he still looks childlike and they only allow children to join their group, but are unsuccessful. Joey manages to escape and travels to Chloe's skeleton in response to a letter from Cvetko saying that he left some of Joey's belongings there, which he can use to escape the city, despite Joey suspecting that the letter was written under duress and that Cvetko is likely dead. Shortly after his arrival Joey is chased by the children, who drain him and ritualistically entomb Joey with Chloe. The book then shows Joey getting rescued by Cvetko, who explains that he became aware of the children's plans to drain and entomb Joey after seeing evidence of this in their belongings, especially as the evidence showed that Chloe was the victim of a similar ritual. The two travel to Boston, where they live together for a period of time until Joey meets a female vampire that looks young like him, with whom he travels the United States. The book ends with an epilogue written by Cvetko, who reveals that he wrote the book based on Joey's journals. Joey was never rescued, as that portion was one that he added in order to give the book a happy ending. Cvetko has been caring for the children for a long time, as he sees them as a surrogate for the child he lost when he was still alive. He has also been infiltrating various vampire nests in order to find proper living environments and to discover any weaknesses that the children can exploit in order to more easily eliminate them. He then chastises the reader for potentially ignoring subtle signs that the work was written by him, that he was part of the children's plans, and that his given history and accent were false. He closes the book out by saying that he has assumed Joey's personality and that the book was written in order to make this process easier, so he can better trick others.  Reception  The Lesser Dead was reviewed by Booklist and Publishers Weekly, the latter of which marked it as a starred review. Tor.com wrote a favorable review, closing it with the statement \\"If your idea of fun includes being seriously discomfited, grab up The Lesser Dead as soon as you can.\\" = Awards = * ALA Best Horror Novel of the Year (2015, won) References Fiction set in 1978 2010s horror novels 2014 American novels American horror novels American vampire novels Works set on the New York City Subway ","title":"The Lesser Dead"},{"id":"51234260","text":"Mantra pushpam is a Vedic hymn that is sung at the time of offering of the flowers to the Hindu deities at the very end of the Pujas.

Description A close-up of the flower, taken near Peterborough in the United Kingdom in 2018 Astragalus danicus is a perennial herb. It grows to about tall with pinnate 3‚Äì7 cm compound leaves having 13‚Äì27 5-12mm long hairy leaflets. Its flowers are usually in shades of blue and purple, rarely white, long and clustered in short, compact racemes, looking like a single composite flower. They are followed by dark brown, fruit pods long, with white hairs. There is some evidence that seeds persist in the soil seed bank, but seed dispersal is poor (generally only 50 cm).BSBI Species Accounts ArchivePlant Life International - Species Fact SheetFolia Geobotanica Habitat and distribution Astragalus danicus ranges across Europe from Ireland and subarctic Russia south to the Alps and central Ukraine. It grows on short, unimproved and dry grassland, usually over limestone or chalk, but can also be found on sand dunes, sandstone sea cliffs, machair and over mica-schist. Rarely it has been found on woodland rides and firing ranges. It grows to an altitude of just 710m. It is very unable to compete with taller plants and this seems to be the main reason it is not found in habitats with acidic or fertilised soils.Online Atlas of the British and Irish Flora Ecology Astragalus danicus flowers provide nectar and are visited by many insects. This species is considered to be mainly pollinated by bees.Folia Geobotanica In the UK the grasslands where A. danicus is found are predominantly Festuca, Bromopsis and Brachypodium grasslands. The species is non-toxic and its common name in English comes from the popular belief in history that cows fed with purple milk-vetch yielded more milk. Conservation Astragalus danicus has protected status. It is considered endangered by the IUCN. In the United Kingdom it has vulnerable status and has been a Biodiversity Action Plan priority species since 2007. Astragalus danicus has declined since the start of the enclosure farming system in the 18th Century, however declines accelerated in some parts of its range since the 1930s, due to agricultural improvement and in some cases due to land going without grazing (the species can only grow in short vegetation). Herbal medicine Astragalus danicus has been indicated to have a number of beneficial medicinal effects, particularly in combatting high blood pressure, however health supplements labelled as 'milk-vetch' may contain extracts from a different species in the genus Astragalus.Pharmacognosy Review Some other species in the genus Astragalus are known to be toxic to animals and referred to in the US as 'locoweed'.USDA Poisonous Plant Research Etymology There are a few explanations for the meaning of the genus name Astragalus. Some say it comes from the Ancient Greek 'astragalos' meaning neck vertebra or ankle joint, either because the shape of the flower clusters is similar to a vertebra or because the shape of the seeds is similar to an ankle bone.Merriam Webster Dictionary - AstragalusFlora of Wisconsin Others say that 'astragalus' is an amalgamation of the Ancient Greek words 'aster' and 'gala' meaning 'star' and 'milk' respectively.A Dictionary of Common Wildflowers of Southern Texas & the Southern Great Plains The species epithet danicus is Latin for 'Danish', presumably it was first identified in Denmark.Latin Dictionary - danicus The English common name comes from the popular belief in history that cows fed with purple milk-vetch yielded more milk.

Facts The JI Case Co complained that it had not committed an unfair labor practice, when it refused to bargain with a new union belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations, because it had made individual contracts with its employees at the Rock Island plant in Illinois. There was no allegation of coercion when these individual contracts were made. JI Case Co contended it should be able to abide by the contracts, and not bargain in good faith to change them in favor of employees through a new collective agreement. Nevertheless, the National Labor Relations Board stated that these contracts were no justification for refusing to engage in collective bargaining. Judgment Jackson J, for a unanimous Supreme Court, held that JI Case Co had committed an unfair labor practice, because the policy of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 required bargaining regardless of individual contracts. Terms of individual contracts would be replaced, for the benefit of the employee, by terms of a collective agreement. Jackson J said the following in the course of the Court's judgment.

Biography Sussman was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941.https://www.lifeposts.com/p/milestone/511/robert- sussman-memorial/lifestory/ He earned undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, and he completed a Ph.D. in anthropology at Duke University in 1972 under John Buettner-Janusch. After teaching briefly at Hunter College in New York, he became a member of the faculty at WUSTL. Sussman's interest was in the evolution of behavior in primates, and he was known for his work with lemurs from Madagascar. He said that studying the behavior of primates would enhance the understanding of human behavior. In the 1990s, he was editor-in-chief of the journal American Anthropologist. He was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2000, and he later chaired AAAS Section H (Anthropology). In 2015, Sussman wrote The Myth of Race: The Troubling Persistence of an Unscientific Idea. In this book, he described race as a social construct rather than an entity based on science. An earlier book, Man The Hunted: Primates, Predators and Human Evolution (co-authored with Donna Hart), made the case that early man evolved as prey rather than as hunters. Sussman died at his home on June 8, 2016, not long after being released from the hospital after a stroke. He was survived by his wife Linda, who was a medical anthropologist and research associate in WUSTL's anthropology department. In 2018, the AAAS established the Robert W.

It is inspired by a true story in the aftermath of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 12 months beginning January 2004. Logline Sabina, a divorced mother of two small children, falls in love with an old friend from the Bosnian war. The two plan to marry, but things go terribly wrong. Short Synopsis The film follows Sabina, a divorced Muslim woman, and Sa≈°a, a Catholic man. The two meet, fall in love, and become engaged, however the society around them is not overly favorable towards their relationship, as they live in post-war Bosnia. Their only true champion is Ankica, whose son was killed in the war and who offers to host a wedding for them on the island of Korƒçula. In the spring Sabina travels to the island and awaits Sa≈°a's arrival, only for the man to never appear. She travels home, where she discovers that Sa≈°a has moved out of their shared apartment without explanation. Weeks pass and Sabina discovers she's pregnant. Her friends and family pressure her to get an abortion, which she refuses to get. Her life grows progressively worse until she's left homeless and jobless. Long Synopsis Sabina K. is inspired by a true story set in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The \\"Sabina\\" of the title plans to marry Sa≈°a (with whom she served during the Bosnian War), but there is a problem. Sabina is Muslim and Sa≈°a a Catholic, and their respective families disapprove of the marriage. Their only ally is an older woman, Ankica, whose son - killed in the war - had been their close friend. \\"Aunt\\" Ankica thinks of Sabina and Sa≈°a as her own children and invites them to her home on the island of Korƒçula to get married. Springtime comes and Sabina travels to Korƒçula where she is reunited with Ankica and where the two women wait for Sa≈°a to join them from Zagreb. The days pass... Sa≈°a never arrives... and with a heavy and troubled heart, Sabina returns to Sarajevo. She discovers that Sa≈°a has taken all his things from her apartment and moved out. There is no note; no explanation. Sabina goes to Sa≈°a's mother for answers, but the deeply embittered woman treats her harshly and calls the police. Mysteriously, inexplicably, the love of Sabina's life is gone and she doesn't know where or why. A few weeks later, Sabina passes out on the job. She goes to the doctor and learns that she is pregnant. Her parents and friends counsel her to have an abortion and put the past behind her, but she refuses. As her pregnancy advances and winter approaches, Sabina loses her job and when her ex-husband tries to shake her down for money by threatening to take the children away permanently, she comes to a breaking point. Love has failed her, and she decides to take her life. The suicide attempt is unsuccessful and Sabina spends several days in the hospital. While there, she is visited by her landlady, who informs her that since her lease will end in another week, she has decided to rent out Sabina's apartment to another family. Feeling abandoned by family and friends, and with no help from social services, Sabina wanders the streets of Sarajevo in the bitter cold of winter. There are no solutions... there is no refuge... and Sabina again makes plans to take her life. She sells the last of her jewelry and surreptitiously buys three times the amount of sleeping pills used in her previous suicide attempt. She checks into a room at a motel and begins swallowing the pills, slipping into unconsciousness. What happens next is subject to opinion... But one thing becomes clear. Sabina will never be the same.

Camozzi led a dissolute life as a widow and a soldier's mistress before she became a nun and adopted a life of total repentance. Her beatification received confirmation from Pope Gregory XVI on 19 September 1834 after the pontiff acknowledged the late nun's 'cultus' (or longstanding and popular devotion). Life Agostina Camozzi was born in 1435 in Como to the well- known doctor Giovanni Camozzi. Camozzi married a stonecutter - despite the protests of her parents - but was widowed not long after their marriage. She soon became the mistress to a Milanese soldier and bore his child - her sole child - though this child died as an infant. She became widowed once more after her second marriage when a jealous rival killed her farmer husband from Mantua competing for her affections. This prompted Camozzi to realize that her life had spun out of control and caused her to experience a religious conversion circa 1450; she henceforth decided to enter the religious life and became a member of the Order of Saint Augustine where she assumed the religious name of \\"Cristina\\". She moved to Verona around this time. Her time in the order became noted for the severe austerities that she imposed upon herself as penance for her earlier life and she lived in a number of convents where she became known as a miracle worker until settling in Spoleto. She clothed herself in a habit that was made from sown-together rags and meditated deep on the passion of Jesus Christ. Camozzi travelled on a pilgrimage to both Assisi and Rome as well as international to Jerusalem in 1457 during the Lenten season but on the return trip died in Spoleto in 1458 due to fever. She received a vision of the Blessed Mother before her death. Her remains were interred at the order's church of Saint Nicholas but re-interred at the Chiesa di San Gregorio Magno in 1921 until 2015 when the remains were moved back to her hometown. In 1999 her remains were examined and the report suggested that she was obese and was 1.45 meters. The report was allowed at the invitation of Monsignor Giampiero Ceccarelli and the Bishop of Spoleto Riccardo Fontana. The examination reported all her teeth were present and the thorax was well preserved while there was the total absence of all internal organs. Beatification Tomb. The confirmation of the late nun's 'cultus' (or popular devotion) on 19 September 1834 allowed for Pope Gregory XVI to approve the nun's beatification. In 1521 she was chosen as the patron of Calvisano.

Later, he was a member of the Jewish Consistory of Bulgaria. He took an active role in the struggle for the restoration of the rights of the Jews after the Second World War.  Biography  Israel Moshe Calmi was born in Ruse, Bulgaria. He acquired his high school education at the Hristo Botev School in the city of his birth. He then went on through a scholarship from the Rothschild family to study law at the Faculty of Law in Berlin, Germany, where he completed his studies with a Ph.D. in law from Heidelberg University.see Israel Calmi, Die v√∂lker- und staatsrechliche stellung von Bulgarien, Heidelberg, H. D√∂rr, 1908. Between the World Wars  Calmi worked as a commercial attorney. He took part in the public activity; he was a member of the Jewish Court of Family Law and a member of the philanthropic Association \\"Malbish Arumim\\" (Clothing the Needy). The Second World War  Starting in the mid-1930s, the Bulgarian government began to undertake activities to get closer to Germany, with the aim of thereby regaining those parts of Bulgaria lost to it following its defeat in the First World War. As part of its conciliatory measures toward Nazi Germany, legislation was passed on 23 January 1941. Known as the Law for the Protection of the Nation, this legislation significantly restricted the rights of Jews. In 1943, as part of its anti-Jewish activity, the government moved to the deportation of Jews from the territories of Bulgaria to the extermination camps in Poland. In February 1943 an agreement was signed between Bulgaria and Germany, under which the Jews of Trakia and Macedonia (‚Äúthe liberated territories‚Äù) would be deported to Poland. At the same time that the transfer of Jews to temporary camps began, Calmi and others acted to reduce the number of Jews who were transferred to the camps.Benjamin Arditi, The Bulgarian Jews during the Nazi Regime, p. 140. In May 1943, Sofia Jews were exiled to provincial towns in order to facilitate their collection by trains and their dispatch to the extermination camps. Calmi and his family were exiled to the town of Cherven Bryag. The attempt to deport Jews to Poland from Bulgaria itself was thwarted thanks to the struggle conducted by the leaders of Bulgaria‚Äôs Jewish community with the support of Dimitar Peshev, the Vice President of the Sobranie ‚Äì Bulgaria‚Äôs Parliament, Metropolitan (Bishop) Stefan, the Head of the Sofian Church, and Metropolitan Cyril, the Head of the Bulgarian Church in Plovdiv, as well as thanks to the opposition of Bulgarian public figures, writers, the Association of Lawyers, the Medical Association, and citizens from across the political spectrum. On 31 May 1944, a new government was established, under the leadership of Ivanov Bagryanov, who was considered to hold pro-Western views. In a meeting between Bagryanov and Jewish public figures, the Consistory was brought back to life, headed by Colonel Avraham Tadjer. Calmi was appointed a member of the Consistory.Haim Keshales, The History of the Jews of Bulgaria during the Holocaust, Vol. III, p. 220. Bagryanov met with members of the Consistory. It was proposed to prepare a proposal for a law under which the rights of Jews would gradually be reinstated. Bagryanov announced his intention to act to annul the Law for the Protection of the Nation and its provisions. For this purpose, Bagryanov sought assistance by a legal expert of stature and accepted Colonel Tadjer‚Äôs recommendation to be assisted by Calmi, who Bagryanov knew to be a skilled and talented jurist Benjamin Arditi, Notable Bulgarian Jews, 1971, VIDNI EVREI V BULGARIA, vol. 4./ On 20 June 1944, Calmi sent Bagryanov a well-structured, reasoned letter,Benjamin Arditi, The Bulgarian Jews during the Nazi Regime, p. 276. via the Red Cross, in which he noted a number of restrictions that should be revoked immediately and various requests: removal of the requirement to wear the Yellow badge, allowing freedom of movement, the right to visit Sofia, the capital city, the reinstatement of the right to work, opening of the Jewish schools, synagogues and rabbinical courts, the granting of allowances for food and clothing, government support of public kitchens, liberation from the work camps, cancellation of the curfew hours, cancellation of the order forbidding Jews to enter shelters, and the restoration of the right of residence, anywhere. Following on from the letter, the two met two or three days after 20 July 1944. At the meeting CalmiBenjamin Arditi, The Bulgarian Jews during the Nazi Regime, p. 276. was asked to travel to various cities in Bulgaria where there were Jewish communities and to present the intention of Bagryanov to annul the Law for the Protection of the Nation and comply with the demands to restore civil rights to Jews, as had been presented by Calmi. The local Jewish committees in Pleven, Shumen, Razgrad, Lukovit, Provadia and Targovishte, organized public meetings, where Calmi lectured. In Russe, the local committee did not approve a meeting with him on the ground that he had not filed a preliminary summary of the matters he was about to address. On 5 September 1944, the Law for the Protection of the Nation was annulled. On 9 September 1944 the Soviet Army entered Sofia, and pro-Communist forces seized power.Michael Bar-Zohar, The Trains Went Out Empty, p. 215. A government formed by the Fatherland Front, a resistance movement that fought against the pro-German government, set up a People‚Äôs Tribunal.

Purely functional programming may also be defined by forbidding state changes and mutable data. Purely functional programming consists of ensuring that functions, inside the functional paradigm, will only depend on their arguments, regardless of any global or local state. Difference between pure and not-pure functional programming The exact difference between pure and impure functional programming is a matter of controversy. A program is usually said to be functional when it uses some concepts of functional programming, such as first-class functions and higher- order functions. However, a first-class function need not be purely functional, as it may use techniques from the imperative paradigm, such as arrays or input/output methods that are not purely functional programs. In fact, the earliest programming languages cited as being functional, IPL and Lisp,The memoir of Herbert A. Simon (1991), Models of My Life pp.189-190 claims that he, Al Newell, and Cliff Shaw are \\"commonly adjudged to be the parents of [the] artificial intelligence [field]\\", for writing Logic Theorist, a program which proved theorems from Principia Mathematica automatically. In order to accomplish this, they had to invent a language and a paradigm which, which viewed retrospectively, embeds functional programming. were both \\"impure\\" functional languages by the current definition. Purely functional data structures are persistent. Persistency is required for functional programming; without it, the same computation could return different results. Functional programming may use persistent non-purely functional data structures, while those data structures may not be used in purely functional programs. Properties of purely functional programming = Strict versus non-strict evaluation = Each evaluation strategy which ends on a purely functional program returns the same result. In particular, it ensures that the programmer does not have to consider in which order programs are evaluated, since eager evaluation will return the same result as lazy evaluation. However, it is still possible that an eager evaluation may not terminate while the lazy evaluation of the same program halts. An advantage of this is that lazy evaluation can be implemented much more easily; as all expressions will return the same result at any moment (regardless of program state), their evaluation can be delayed as much as necessary. =Parallel computing= Purely functional programming simplifies parallel computing since two purely functional parts of the evaluation never interact. =Data structures= Purely functional data structures are often represented in a different way than their imperative counterparts.Purely functional data structures by Chris Okasaki, Cambridge University Press, 1998, For example, array with constant- time access and update is a basic component of most imperative languages and many imperative data-structures, such as hash table and binary heap, are based on arrays. Arrays can be replaced by map or random access list, which admits purely functional implementation, but the access and update time is logarithmic. Therefore, purely functional data structures can be used in languages which are non-functional, but they may not be the most efficient tool available, especially if persistency is not required. In general, conversion of an imperative program to a purely functional one also requires ensuring that the formerly-mutable structures are now explicitly returned from functions that update them, a program structure called store-passing style.  Purely functional language  A purely functional language is a language which only admits purely functional programming. Purely functional programs can however be written in languages which are not purely functional.

Inside the preserved example at Doniford Halt The archetypal Pagoda Platform Shelter was a distinctively-shaped corrugated iron structure used by passengers waiting at railway stations in Wales and southern England. Origins In Britain Pagoda shelters are associated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) who introduced them in 1907 and erected a patchwork of them across their network. They were manufactured by an outside supplier and delivered in kit form. They could therefore be assembled offsite, delivered on standard well wagons and craned into position, or assembled onsite, according to circumstances. The GWR opened its first \\"Haltes\\" on 12 October 1903, anglicising the name to \\"Halt\\" in 1905. They were prime candidates for Pagoda shelters, but the market was crowded: finance, tradition, knowledge, skills and materials to hand meant that some lines had pagodas aplenty, some one or two and others none at all. The Bala to Ffestiniog Line in upland Wales, for example, had six halts erected at remote, virgin sites between the World Wars, and had pagoda shelters, but , , and had shelters with other designs. Opening halts and standardising cheap to install and cheap to buy infrastructure in the face of competition firstly from trams, then buses and ultimately cars overlapped with other initiatives such as the railmotor. Spread Pagoda shelters were generally associated with branch lines, but many were erected next to regional arteries and some were erected next to main lines; being an example on what was and remains a high speed route out of . Specifications Although they were renowned for their shape, their greatest virtues were their cost, simplicity and durability, coupled with the fact that the GWR \\"took them seriously\\". They were built to precise working drawings with materials to exact engineering specifications. The example installed at the remote , for example, had a roof made of \\"No. 18 SWG Galvanised 3 inch Corrugated Sheeting [...] with a floor of specially prepared timber.\\" Suitability Many small halts used wooden platforms on a timber frame, rather than masonry or earth. The pagoda shelter could be used for these because of its light weight. Platform configurations A pagoda shelter was typically provided for each platform, as, for example, at . As the halts where they were used were mostly on single-track lines, there was only one shelter, though had only one platform with two pagoda shelters. Stations such as and Ruislip Gardens with two platforms, had two, one on each platform, as did . and had two platforms but a pagoda shelter opposite the masonry station building only. Perivale Halt had several on each platform. Defiance Halt (later Defiance Platform) had one on each platform initially, but two more were added to the Up platform during the station's life. had three platform faces with a pagoda shelter only on the most southerly. Variations Most pagoda shelters were simple structures with one doorway leading into one room. At , however, the station building was a \\"Pagoda Building\\", with three doors and four windows facing the platform and rooms inside for different purposes. still has a pagoda shelter which used to incorporate a \\"lean-to\\" staff cabin at the Aberdyfi end. The lean-to appears to have been incorporated into the overall building since it was de-staffed. The shelter differs from most pagodas in that it is either built of or clad with timber. Although the standard pagoda shelter measured by , they could be erected to different dimensions, occasionally at the same location, such as . Uses The shelters were mainly used by passengers waiting for trains, but at least two - at and - were \\"Pagoda lamp huts\\", whilst one at was a shed. and each had a \\"Pagoda bike shed\\". Pagoda huts existed next to Weymouth Junction signalbox, and in station goods yard, neither was for passenger use. A Pagoda shelter was erected at right angles to the track next to the down platform at , unsigned and painted black; research continues into its purpose. It was still there in 1989, 28 years after the station closed and long after all other buildings had been demolished. Other railways' pagoda shelters The GWR did not have a complete monopoly of pagoda shelters; , and on the former LSWR branch near Bodmin in Cornwall had one each.

Described as 'perhaps the greatest of all time' in the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers biography of him, An Unassuming Genius, he was an extraordinary talent in the field of peal composition. Life Albert J Pitman, in his thirties. Born in Bridgend, Glamorgan in 1887, two years later he moved with his family some twenty miles west, to Baglan, Neath Port Talbot. He had very little education, leaving school at the age of twelve, but with his teacher telling him ‚Äòthere‚Äôs nothing more I can teach you.‚Äô This was perhaps an early sign of an unusual talent. In 1903 at the age of sixteen he joined the Great Western Railway Company and worked for them until his compulsory retirement at sixty- five. He learned to ring bells the year he left school, probably from his father, who was a member of the bell-ringing band at St Catharine's Church, Baglan. Only eleven years later, in 1910, he rang and conducted his own peal, of 5040 Grandsire Triples at St Mary‚Äôs Church, Aberavon, 'a highly unusual step for a ‚Äòfirst-timer.‚Äô Later, his daughter Dolly, who, with her siblings, inherited his mathematical genius, was paid a silver threepenny piece to check his compositions for ‚Äòfalseness'Falseness means not repeating any of the rows of figures in the peal. None was found to be so then, nor since. Many of his compositions appeared to have been inspired by challenges thrown down by editorials, letters and articles in The Ringing World. The first peal containing more than one Triples method was composed and conducted by him in 1925. Four years later he composed and conducted the first peal of Forward Major, and one of his peals was rung during the celebrations of the Silver Wedding anniversary of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He continued to compose throughout the 1940s; a decade capped by him being accorded the unusual privilege of writing the leading article in The Ringing World.The Ringing World - Spliced Surprise Major, A J Pitman, 4 March 1949 p89 However, it was during the 1950s that he produced what many regard as his masterpieces; a ground-breaking peal of 5280 Spliced Surprise Major, followed by a composition of 5472 or 5408 changes - in The Ringing World it was described as a ‚Äòweek of ringing history‚Äô. His major achievement in 1961 was the publication of two compositions, numbers 1 and 2 of 13440 Spliced Surprise Major in six methods, yet another challenge for serious bell-ringers. Less well known, but nonetheless important, are his compositions of ‚ÄòSunday Service‚Äô touches; shorter pieces rung prior to church services, which he continued to produce right up to the year of his death. Throughout his life Pitman was convinced that a major feature of composition was to produce the best music, and his compositions have often been regarded as amongst the most musical. Indeed, the issue of the musical nature of bell ringing was raised by a leader in The Times on the 1st of February 1927An Unassuming Genius p49 Pitman died on August 16, 1966 and was buried at St Catharine‚Äôs Church, Baglan, in the grave of his late wife, Evelyn, who had died in 1953, and close to the grave of his parents. Bell-ringers mark the death of a colleague by ringing a peal or quarter peal, often rung ‚Äòmuffled‚ÄôMuffled - muffles are leather pouches which are strapped to one side of the clapper of each bell, so that when that side of the clapper strikes the bell, the sound is muffled. the first being rung on the day of his funeral at St Catharine‚Äôs. On the day, and in the following weeks, memorial peals were rung in Cheshire, Yorkshire, Surrey, Monmouthshire and Westminster.An Unassuming Genius - p151 Legacy  A current copy of The Ringing World is unlikely not to contain a reference to him. S4C, the Welsh- language television channel (the equivalent of Channel 4), broadcast a piece on him in their Christmas Eve 1984 documentary on bell-ringing in Wales, C√¢n y Clychau. The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers estimate the number of his published compositions to be ‚Äòover a hundred‚Äô email from Alan Glover, CCCBR Librarian 29-07-2016 with many more unpublished, some of which he sent directly to conductors he felt could ‚Äòdo justice‚Äô to the piece. His name lives on in Wales through a competition for the Pitman Trophy. His compositions are regularly rung throughout the now-global bell-ringing world. A search on Bellboard shows compositions of his rung over 600 times in the UK alone since 2000. To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, members of the Llandaff and Monmouth DACBR rang his composition of Grandsire Doubles, as was rung on the same bells at St Catharine's Church, Baglan, immediately after his funeral. Prior to the peal, prayers were said at the graveside, followed by a ringing of hand-bells.

When the time was up, the panel voted for which two contestants (one man & one woman) should be the best together. In the two panelist era, the panel chose which girl they liked the best and then after asking one question to the fellas, choose whom to be with. The woman also won a $250 bonus if her choice matched the panel's. The newly-formed couple then went into what's called \\"The Love Machine\\".

Origins The line through the future station site opened in 1883, replacing the narrow gauge Festiniog and Blaenau Railway which had run along the same route since 1868. Teigl Halt was one of the 198 opened by the Great Western Railway (GWR) between 1927 and 1939, spurred by rising competition with buses and, to a lesser degree, cars. Description The unstaffed halt's single platform edge was made of sleepers, the platform itself being infilled with ash and cinders. It was a mere long, so drivers had instructions to stop ensuring the guard's compartment was alongside. The amenities provided were a Pagoda platform shelter and an oil lamp, with a rough farm occupation crossing at the southern end. Neighbouring infrastructure Just south of the crossing, from Bala, was a very short siding, physically unconnected to and at right angles to the track. This was for storing Engineering Department's motor trolleys. Staff wishing to make use of this would contact \\"Control\\" (the line's controllers and signallers) from Hut No. 19 which stood on the opposite side of the tracks from the platform. This hut contained a telephone and key apparatus enabling staff to take safe possession of the line. When they were given permission to do so they manhandled the trolley onto the \\"main line\\", returning it the same way in due course. A short distance south of the trolley siding, in plain view from the station when looking along the sharply curved track, was the Pont Llefraith bridge over the Afon Teigl.Halt and bridge Jaggers Heritage This was replaced in the 1970s.Bridge replacement near Teigl Halt Alan Hayward With a radius of just the curve and a cutting obscured a northbound (\\"Down\\") driver's view of an occupation crossing a short distance north of the halt, so a bell operated by a treadle warned road users of a train's approach. Services The September 1959 timetable shows * Northbound ** three trains calling at all stations from Bala to Blaenau on Monday to Saturday ** an extra evening train calling at all stations from Bala to Blaenau on Saturday ** a Monday to Friday train calling at all stations from Bala to Trawsfynydd *** The journey time from Bala to the halt was around 69 minutes. * Southbound ** three trains calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala on Monday to Saturday ** two extra trains calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala on Saturday ** an extra train calling at all stations from Blaenau to Trawsfynydd on Saturday evening ** a Monday to Friday train calling at all stations from Blaenau to Bala, except Llafar, Bryncelynog and Cwm Prysor Halts *** The journey time from Blaenau to the halt was around 11 minutes. * There was no Sunday service. In 1935 the Ministry of Transport stated that the halt was used by 70 passengers per week. After the Second World War at the latest most trains were composed of two carriages, with one regular turn comprising just one brake third coach. At least one train along the line regularly ran as a mixed train, with a second between Bala and Arenig. By that time such trains had become rare on Britain's railways. Workmen's trains had been a feature of the line from the outset; they were the Festiniog and Blaenau Railway's biggest source of revenue. Such a service between Trawsfynydd and Blaenau Ffestiniog survived to the line's closure to passengers in 1960.1960 Working timetable, via 2D53 Up to 1930 at the earliest such services used dedicated, lower standard, coaches which used a specific siding at Blaenau where the men boarded from and alighted to the ballast.Blaenau Ffestiniog (GWR) track layout Signalling Record Society The line from Bala north to Trawsfynydd was designated in the restrictive \\"Blue\\" weight limit, with the section from Trawsfynydd to Blaenau limited even more tightly to \\"Yellow\\". The literature conjectures on overweight classes being used on troop trains, but no solid claim or photograph has been published. Only two steam age photos of the line show anything other than an 0-4-2 or 0-6-0 tank engine, they being of GWR 2251 Class 0-6-0s taken in the 1940s. As the 1950s passed \\"5700\\" and \\"7400\\" 0-6-PTs stole the show, exemplified by 9610 at Festiniog in the 1950s. 0-4-2T engines \\"..suffer[ed] from limited tank capacity and power.\\" The halt in film A mirror continuity sequence showing a train crossing the Teigl and reaching the halt features very briefly in an early Cold War spy film starring Elizabeth Taylor.\\"The Conspirator\\", MGM 1949, 26 minutes from start  Closure and reopening  By the 1950s the line was deemed unremunerative. A survey undertaken in 1956 and 1957 found that the average daily numbers of passengers boarding and alighting were: *Blaenau Ffestiniog Central 62 and 65 *Manod Halt 7 and 4 *Teigl Halt 5 and 5 *Festiniog 28 and 26 *Maentwrog Road 8 and 6 *Trawsfynydd Lake Halt 1 and 1 *Trawsfynydd 28 and 24 *Llafar Halt 2 and 2 *Bryn-celynog Halt 2 and 2 *Cwm Prysor Halt 3 and 3 *Arenig 5 and 5 *Capel Celyn Halt 7 and 8 *Tyddyn Bridge Halt 4 and 6 *Frongoch 18 and 15 *Bala 65 and 58 Freight traffic was not heavy, most arriving and leaving Bala did so from and to the south and that to Blaenau could be handled from the Conwy Valley Line northwards. In 1957 Parliament authorised Liverpool Corporation to flood a section of the line by damming the Afon Tryweryn. Monies were made available to divert the route round the dam, but it was decided that improving the road from Bala to Llan Ffestiniog would be of greater benefit. Road transport alternatives were established for groups such as schoolchildren and workers. The plans afoot for rail serving Trawsfynydd nuclear power station were to be catered for by building the long-discussed cross-town link between the two Blaenau standard gauge stations. The estimated financial savings to be made were ¬£23,300 by withdrawing the passenger service and ¬£7000 in renewal charges. The halt closed in January 1960 but freight trains continued to pass the site for a further year. In 1964 the line, but not the halt, reopened from Blaenau southwards through the site of the halt to a siding near the site of where a large (\\"Goliath\\") gantry was erected to load and unload traffic for the then new Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. The main goods transported were nuclear fuel rods carried in nuclear flasks. The line was also used during the late 1980s for freight traffic to a siding at serving the explosives factory in Penrhyndeudraeth. Passenger trains briefly returned to the line in 1989, passing through to a temporary platform at . These trains ran for one summer in an attempt to encourage tourism at the power station. Few people used the service to visit the power station, most riders travelled \\"for the ride\\", so the following year tourist trains drove to the line's terminus then reversed, with no-one getting on or off.Tourists trains to the station 2D53 This service lasted until the end of the 1990 Summer season. Rail enthusiasts' special trains traversed the line from time to time. Notable examples were two \\"last trains\\". The first ran from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog and return on 22 January 1961Last train ticket Michael Clemens and in the post-1964 era the \\"Trawsfynydd Lament\\"The Trawsfynydd Lament Penmorfa ran southwards to the limit of line at the power station loading point on 17 October 1998, the line having become redundant following removal of nuclear material from the power station. The station site in the 21st Century Geograph-5166981-the site of the halt in October 2016 In 2011 part of the platform edge remained. By October 2016 even that had disappeared, with only a low mound remaining under undergrowth to suggest the halt had ever existed, although the mothballed line still ran through the site to the former nuclear flask loading point. The future Between 2000 and 2011 there were at least two attempts to put the remaining line to use. In 2011 there were proposals to use the rails as a recreational velorail track. Neither this nor the earlier idea came to anything. The possibility remains that the surviving line could see future preservation or reuse by the nuclear industry. To considerable local surprise fresh moves to reopen the line from Blaenau as far south as Trawsfynydd began in September 2016, with the formation of The Trawsfynydd & Blaenau Ffestiniog Community Railway Company. On 21 September at least one regional newspaper reported that \\"Volunteers are set to start work this weekend on clearing vegetation from the trackbed between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd.\\" The company was quoted as saying \\"We have been given a licence by Network Rail to clear and survey the line.\\" By mid-October 2016 the company had achieved six working days of track clearance.

The site's name Cave of Bridges hints to the many limestone arches (or bridges) that remain after the partial collapse of the cave's vault. Although excavations are still in progress, at least three distinct levels of ancient human occupation are already documented. At the site's deepest layers, around 5 meters below the ground, primitive flaked stone tools were unearthed, dating back to around 71,000 years BP.David Chandler, A History of Cambodia (Westview Publishers: Boulder Colorado, 2008) p. 13. Of great interest are above layers that contain records of the Hoabinhian (11,000 to 5,000 years BP) whose stratigraphic and chronological context has yet to be defined. Future excavations at Laang Spean might help to clarify the concept and \\"nature of the Hoabinhian\\" occupation and provide new data on the Pleistocene/Holocene transition in the region Documentation Roland Mourer and C√©cile Mourer- Chauvir√© working for the Royal University of Phnom Penh undertook the first excavations from 1965 to 1969 and almost immediately brought to light evidence of prehistoric human occupation in Laang Spean from as long ago as 6.240 years BP. Objects found included tools made of hornfel, pottery, burnt animal bones, carbonized matter, shells of mollusks and a great variety of micro fauna remains. In a deeper middle layer they found artifacts and tools, that \\"showed similarities with [] so-called Hoabinhian sites that had been uncovered in Southeast Asia, suggesting the possibility of a common cultural bedrock for a group of humans stretching from Burma to Vietnam.\\" Thirty years of war and ten years of mine clearing prevented further excavations. The French-Cambodian Prehistoric Mission - a team of Cambodian and French archaeologists and students - has resumed archaeological work since 2009 in room no. 2 (central part of the cave) over a surface of nearly that provides new stratigraphic, chronocultural and archaeo-zoological results. Currently, 20 stratigraphic units are recorded on a ground surface of to a depth of 5 meters without reaching the bed rock.

The film stars four pairs Aditya Om, Ankitha, Nandamuri Harikrishna, Bhanupriya, Suman, Rachana, Vineeth and Sanghavi in the lead roles. Veteran actress Lakshmi played the main villain role in this film. This film is a hit at the box-office.  Plot  Nani (Aditya Om) and Bala (Ankitha) study in the same college. The story begins with Nani arranging a marriage for his friends Veera Venkata Satya Narayana (Chitram Srinu) and Naga Venkata Ratna Kumari in Annavaram with the help of his classmate John David (Venu Madhav). Bala also joins the marriage. She gets to know that Nani is an orphan and starts liking Nani's attitude and behaviour. Nani also has same feelings towards Bala but he doesn't reveal them to her. After the marriage, John David tells her that he and Nani have arranged this marriage as part of their business A-1 Match Fixing Centre and Nani is actually a marriage broker who arranges marriages for making money. She gets upset when Nani bids her good bye saying that there is hardly any friendship between them. Indu (Bhanupriya), Chandu (Rachana) and Sindhu (Sanghavi) are three daughters of Rama Krishna (Ranganath) and nieces of Ammayiamma (Rama Prabha). Indu is obsessed with cleanliness, Chandu is scared of lizards and Sindhu is a sincere worshipper. Rama Krishna lost his wife and his brother in law (Ammayiamma's husband) in a car accident and he believes the reason to be not believing in astrology. He strongly decides to get his three daughters married to three brothers only with whom their horoscopes match perfectly. Ammayiamma approaches Nani for finding suitable matches for her nieces. Nani suggests Ammayiamma the three sons of Balaramaiah Naidu (K. Viswanath) and Sathyapriya of Ramapuram village - Krishnama Naidu (Nandamuri Harikrishna) for Indu, Chandrama Naidu (Suman) for Chandu and Srinivasa Naidu (Vineeth) for Sindhu. Nani goes to Ramapuram as the younger brother of Indu, Chandu and Sindhu for Dasara festival celebrations and all four stay in the house of Punju Raju (K. Chakravarthy) which is exactly opposite to Balaramaiah Naidu's house. Nani plans to create love between the couples and get them married. In his efforts to unite the three couples, he bumps into Bala again who is the only younger sister of the three brothers. Both exchange their love for each other but are scared to reveal it to her family. From then, the story takes a twist with the entry of Achamamba (Lakshmi) who was once in love with Balaramaiah Naidu and is waiting to take revenge on him for not marrying her. By winning in the village cockfight, she convinces Balaramaiah Naidu for getting his daughter Bala married to foreign returned son of her brother (Jaya Prakash Reddy). The rest of the plot is all about how Achamamba's evil plans are destroyed by Krishnama Naidu and the four couples got married.

Feminist theology and inclusive language Since 1990, Aldredge-Clanton has been writing, speaking, and preaching on feminist theology and specifically on including female language for the Divine as a foundation for equality, justice, and peace. In her introduction to Changing Church: Stories of Liberating Ministers she writes: ‚ÄúMy vision is for the Divine Feminine to shine forth in all Her glory in multicultural visual imagery and in the language of worship, supporting equal partnership of women and men. My vision is of a church where the Divine Feminine and women ministers don‚Äôt have to be defended or marginalized, but are fully and equally included throughout every worship service and every activity of the church. My vision is for the Sacred Feminine to be worshipped not only in Christian congregations, but in every religion all over the world, and for women to share equally in the leadership of every religion. My vision is for girls to believe they are equal to boys because they hear and see the Supreme Being worshipped as ‚ÄòShe‚Äô as well as ‚ÄòHe.'‚Äù Aldredge-Clanton, Jann. Changing Church: Stories of Liberating Ministers. Cascade Books, 2011. Many traditionalists are critical of Aldredge-Clanton's views.

One of the conservative critics of inclusive theology and language, Russell D. Moore, warns that the children's musical by Aldredge-Clanton and composer Larry E. Schultz, Imagine God! A Children‚Äôs Musical Exploring and Expressing Images of God is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù because ‚Äúfeminist theologians are correct indeed that it is easier to transform the imaginations of children in thinking about God.‚Äù Moore continues his critique writing, ‚ÄúWhat is at stake here are [sic] not whether the church will accommodate more ‚Äògender-inclusive‚Äô language, but instead the doctrines of God and revelation‚Äîand indeed the gospel itself.‚Äù ‚Äú‚ÄôMother God‚Äô Goes to Children‚Äôs Church,‚Äù SBC Life: Journal of the Southern Baptist Convention (August 2004), (http://www.sbclife.net/Articles/2004/08/sla9) Aldredge-Clanton is one of the founders of the New Wineskins Community in Dallas, Texas.

Her beatification was celebrated on 10 October 1993. Life Elisabetta Maria Satellico was born in the Republic of Venice on 31 December 1706 to Piero Satellico and Lucia Mander. Satellico - and her parents as well - lived in the home of her priest maternal uncle who instilled in her a moral and cultural education. Satellico was often frail during her childhood but made up for her poor health in her musical and singing abilities. She cultivated a deep religious faith as a child and was determined to enter the religious life at the earliest time possible as part of the Capuchin Poor Clares and she often said: \\"I want to become a nun and if I succeed I want to become a saint\\". She was a student at the Poor Clare convent at Ostra Vetere where she used the organ and sang songs. The order received her into their ranks in Senigallia in 1720. She was later elected as the abbess of her convent in 1742. Due to her age the Bishop of Senigallia did not grant her permission to be vested in the habit though the new bishop Bartolomeo Castelli allowed her to do so on 13 May 1725; this enabled her to commence her novitiate until her profession which she made on 19 May 1726 in the name of \\"Maria Crocifissa\\" into the hands of the vicar general of the diocese. Her spiritual directors were Angelo Sandreani and Giovanni Battista Scaramelli (her first biographer). Satellico died of tuberculosis on 8 November 1745 and she was buried at the Chiesa di Santa Lucia in Ostra Vetere. Beatification The beatification process opened in an informative process that commenced on 18 August 1752 in the Diocese of Senigallia that was later suspended though resumed in 1826 under Pope Leo XII before stalling once more. Pope Pius X later resumed the cause in 1914 before his death. One more process followed this as well as the approval of her writings while the two previous processes received validation from the Congregation of Rites. The beatification process commenced - on an official level - when she was titled as a Servant of God on 22 February 1806 under Pope Pius VII. The postulation later submitted the Positio to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints decades later in 1985 which allowed for a team of theologians to approve the cause on 27 November 1990 and for the C.C.S. to follow suit on 9 April 1991. On 14 May 1991 she was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late religious had led a life of heroic virtue. The miracle needed for her beatification was investigated in a diocesan process in the Italian diocese of its origin and received the validation of the C.C.S. on 4 October 1991 while a medical board met and approved the healing to be a miracle on 1 April 1992; theologians followed on 9 October 1992 and the C.C.S. gave their approval to it as well on 12 January 1993. John Paul II provided the final approval needed on 2 April 1993 and beatified Satellico on 10 October 1993.

It was first published in the United States on June 7, 2016 through Berkley Books and is about a nomadic band of vampires and the lone survivor of their blood lust. The book ties into Buehlman's prior novel The Lesser Dead via the character Clayton, who is repeatedly referenced by The Lesser Dead's main characters.  Synopsis  The book is set in the 1960s, where a group of nomadic vampires drive across America in muscle cars in search of victims. They attack Judith Lamb and her family, killing her husband and son. Judith herself almost dies but manages to survive and join a convent in the hope that it will bring her peace. In the convent she's approached by The Bereaved, a group of vampire hunters seeking the destruction of all vampires.  Reception  The Suicide Motor Club received reviews from the Library Journal, Booklist, Locus Online, and Publishers Weekly. Creative Loafing Tampa Bay and The A.V. Club also reviewed the book, the latter of whom felt that while the book had some weaknesses the work's pacing made the book \\"easily [breeze] by those weaknesses\\".

He could not afford any formal education and is perhaps the only convict-turned-Rickshaw puller who has penned a dozen novels and over a hundred short stories, apart from non-fiction essays.  Early life  Byapari was born into Namasudra caste at Barisal in Bangladesh. His family migrated to West Bengal when he was three years old. The family was first resettled in Bankura, Shiromanipur Refugee camp. Later they were forced to move to Ghutiyari Sharif, Gholadoltala Refugee Camp, South 24 Paraganas and they lived there until 1969. However, the young Byapari had left his home at the age of fourteen and undertook a number of low-paid informal sector jobs in various cities in Assam, Lucknow, Delhi and Allahabad. After spending two years in Dandakaranya, he shifted to Kolkata in 1973. He had a brief stint with the Naxals in central India. It was during his prison term, he educated himself to read. He was closely associated with the famous labour activist Shankar Guha Niyogi.  Life as an author  He came to prominence with the publication of his influential essay Is there a Dalit writing in Bangla?, translated by Meenakshi Mukherjee, in the journal Economic and Political Weekly. While working as a rickshaw puller, he had a chance meeting with Mahasweta Devi, and she asked him to write for her 'Bartika' journal He has pointed out that how the upper Caste refugees from East Bengal are given preferential treatment while being resettled in Kolkata, as favoured by the Upper Caste officials in the West Bengal. Rajya Sabha TV has made a documentary on his life. = Books = He wrote a memoir ‡¶á‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶ö‡¶£‡ßç‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶≤ ‡¶ú‡ßÄ‡¶¨‡¶® in Bengali, translated into English by Sipra Mukherjee as Interrogating my Chandal life: An Autobiography of a Dalit (Sage-Samya) which won The Hindu Prize.https://www.thehindu.com/lit-for-life/names-audiences- trolls-the-hindu-lit-for-life-2019-had-it-all/article26048649.ece/photo/1/ The book records the experiences of oppression and marginalisation that Dalits face in Bengal which is otherwise known as a 'casteless society', as claimed by many a bhadralok. Being a Dalit is central to his writing. As he says, \\"I‚Äôm a Dalit by birth. Only a dalit, oppressed by social forces can experience true dalan (oppression) in life. There should be that dalan as a dalit in Dalit writing. Dalit literature should be based on dalit life. Some of my writings deal with dalit life; some to be judged neutrally, without any preconceived estimation\\". He says he is a chandal in two ways, by birth and by rage (krodha chandal).  Award  In 2014 he was honoured with Suprabha Majumdar prize awarded by Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi. He received the Sharmila Ghosh Smriti Literary prize in 2015.

Their ostensible purpose is to strengthen the respiratory musculature by making it work harder. There is some evidence that they may improve endurance capacity (VO2 max) and power output, but research into their benefits has so far generally proven inconclusive.  Training masks  Training masks allow users to actively work on their respiratory muscle fitness. Originally designed to simulate training at altitude, the concept failed to deliver in multiple research trials. Training in hypoxic (low oxygen) environments increases red blood cell mass and improves oxygen transport, giving athletes a measurable performance boost when competing at sea level.Gore, C.J., Clark, S.A., Saunders, P.U. (2007). Nonhematological mechanisms of improved sea-level performance after hypoxic exposure. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2007 Sep;39(9):1600-9. The use of training masks, however, has no measurable effect on haemoglobin, hematocrit levels and oxygen transport in athletes, as they do not alter the oxygen concentration of the air taken in. However, they appear to add resistance to the respiratory muscles by limiting air supply, thus triggering an adaptive physiological response.Klusiewicz, A., Borkowski, L., Zdanowicz, R., Boros, P., & Wesolowski, S. (2008). The inspiratory muscle training in elite rowers. Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness, 48(3), 279. The muscles of respiration, from the diaphragm and the intercostals to the assisting musculature, need to be trained like any other muscles to increase resistance to fatigue and maximize performance. Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT) is a training method developed to condition the muscles of respiration specifically. RMT has been shown to markedly improve strength, speed, power and endurance in athletes.McConnell, A (2013). Functional benefits of respiratory muscle training. in: Respiratory Muscle Training: Theory and Practice. Elsevier Preoperative Respiratory Muscle Training (RMT), or Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT), is also used in the patients who are scheduled to undergo cardiac or abdominal surgery aiming to reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Training masks allow athletes to strengthen their respiratory muscle fitness without having to be confined to stationary devices or special facilities. By restricting the user's breathing, the devices may improve cardiorespiratory fitness, leading to better sport performance.HajGhanbari, B., Yamabayashi, C., Buna, T.R., Coelho, J.D., Freedman, K.D., Morton, T.A., Palmer, S.A., Toy, M.A., Walsh, C., Sheel, A.W., Reid, W.D. (2013). Effects of respiratory muscle training on performance in athletes: a systematic review with meta-analyses. J Strength Cond Res 2013 Jun;27(6):1643-63. This is especially relevant to elite athletes, where the pulmonary system may become a limiting factor.McKenzie, D. C. (2012). Respiratory physiology: adaptations to high-level exercise. British Journal of Sports Medicine. During a 6-week high-intensity training program, moderately trained subjects using training masks were found to have improved their endurance capacity (VO2 max) and power output significantly. While observing that the respiratory muscle loading improved performance across multiple metrics, the researchers speculated that the performance increases may also have been attributable to the re-breathing of expired air, which would mean at least some of the positive results were due to improved CO2 tolerance.Porcari, J.P., Probst, L., Forrester, K., Doberstein, S., Foster, C., Cress, M.L., Schmidt, K. (2016). Effect of Wearing the Elevation Training Mask on Aerobic Capacity, Lung Function, and Hematological Variables. J Sports Sci Med 2016 May 23; 15(2): 379‚Äì86 There is conflicting research on the performance benefits of RMT, some challenging the assumption that an increase in inspiratory muscle fitness translates to better work capacity and athletic performance.Inbar, O., Weiner, P., Azgad, Y., Rotstein, A., & Weinstein, Y. (2000). Specific inspiratory muscle training in well-trained endurance athletes. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 32(7), 1233-1237.Williams et al (2002). Inspiratory muscle training fails to improve endurance capacity in athletes. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2002 Jul;34(7): 1194-8 A comprehensive review of the literature by Gigliotti et al. (2006) concluded that RMT does improve relevant performance markers in well-controlled and rigorously designed studies, but the mechanisms behind these improvements are not fully understood and require further research.Gigliotti, F., Binazzi, B., Scano, G.

Biography  The son of a goldsmith, abbot Rive was gifted with a vast memory, a penetrating mind and the immense erudition that can give an infinite reading. He began to raise his literary treasures barely fourteen years old. After embracing the ecclesiastical state, he first taught philosophy at St. Charles College of Avignon. He then resigned in 1767 the cure of Moll√©g√®s which he had been provided, and came to live in Paris. The following year he became librarian of the Duke de la Valliere, a position he held until the death of the Duke in 1780, who bequeathed him 6000 pounds. Although he increased the library which he had charge of with large number of rare and valuable books, he did not participate in drafting the catalog of the collection for the duchess of Ch√¢tillon, heir to the Duke of La Valliere commissioned Debure and Vanpraet to catalog the rare books of the library. This preference offended Rive who revenged himself by bitter criticisms against the two scientists. His pride and his irascible and annoying nature quarreled with those caring like him of bibliography, and whom he stigmatized with insulting epithets, to the point that his career was punctuated by continual disputes and debates, even if he was said to have been, in his interior, good parent and friend, and excellent master.In his Dictionnaire raisonn√© de Bibliographie, Gabriel Peignot wrote about him that \\"He might have been entitled to the rank of first bibliographer of his time, had his pride and his penchant for satire not tarnished his glory. \\" When the Marquis de M√©janes bequeathed a considerable library to the , the archbishop of Aix proposed, on behalf of his fellow Proven√ßaux, that abbot Rive be the librarian of the biblioth√®que M√©janes. Rive accepted this post, but his exorbitant claims gave rise to endless disputes, that his presence at Aix, where he had returned, made even more difficult to close. Meanwhile, the R√©volution broke out and put an end to this project. Abbot Rive then founded in the Proven√ßal capital, the faction of the Fr√®res Anti-Politiques (Anti-Political Brethren), gathering little people who were sowing terror. Their misdeeds lead to the in which was notably murdered lawyer , of which Rive was even accused of causing death. No one knows where he would have stopped had he not died in 1792 of a stroke at age 62.

However, in Tirunelveli, Perumal Pichai's men, who were discussing what happened to him, assume that he might be in Colombo with his second wife (Sudha Chandran) and three sons: Mahendra Pichai (O. A. K. Sundar), the eldest; Devendra Pichai (John Vijay), the second- eldest; and Raavana Pichai (Bobby Simha), the youngest. In Colombo, Raavana, after consulting his mother regarding his father's whereabouts, leaves for Tirunelveli and finds out that Saamy killed his father. Raavana begins to hunt down men who turned approver against his father and takes back his father's mantle. Saamy applies for a transfer to Tirunelveli to stop Raavana, which is approved. After 28 years, where Ramsaamy (Vikram) lives in New Delhi, working as a front office manager for Union Minister G. Viswanathan (Prabhu). He is post-doc in Law and intends to pursue IAS as per the wishes of his grandparents (Delhi Ganesh and Sumitra), who have raised him in a Brahminical and non-violent manner so that he does not end up as a police officer like his father. One day, Ram meets Viswanathan's daughter Diya (Keerthy Suresh), who has returned from London after completing her studies and who constantly disagrees with him. Later, when Raavana asks Viswanathan for the pending commission amount to be paid for transferring the party fund secretly, he simply replies to ask the party directly and not him. Irritated, Raavana kidnaps Diya for immediate settlement of payment. Ram rescues her from Raavana's goons and drops her home. She is impressed by his diplomatic nature and falls in love with him. Soon after, Ram accidentally happens to seize a van containing black money being transferred by Raavana on a commission basis. He hands the money over to the President of India without revealing his identity, which once again frustrates Raavana. Diya constantly proposes to Ram, which he rejects initially but gives in later. Ram succeeds in the UPSC exam and leaves for Mussoorie for one-year training. After his return, his grandparents are shell shocked to see that he has opted for IPS and that he has been posted as probationary ACP in Tirunelveli. When Ram asks the reason for their reaction, his grandfather tells the truth that in fact, his father Aarusaamy has been a DCP in Tirunelveli. Ram's grandfather begins to explain what happened 28 years ago. When Saamy and Bhuvana were on their way to Tirunelveli, they were hacked to death by the Pichai brothers to avenge their father's death. Before dying, Saamy manages to open his dead wife's uterus and prematurely deliver his child (Ram). Bhuvana's parents take Ram and escape to Delhi, while the rest of their family is killed by a truck accident planned by Raavana. Agitated by hearing his tragic past, Ram decides to go Tirunelveli and get justice for his parents' death. Ram's grandparents accept his decision, and he leaves for Tirunelveli and decides to take on the Pichai brothers. He initially warns Raavana and vows to bring the Pichai brothers before the law for killing his parents. Ram later razes Perumal's statue, which had been illegally placed at an intersection by Raavana and caused a lot of traffic problems. A cat-and-mouse game ensues between Ram and Raavana, with both of them trying to get rid of each other. Per the president's orders Sammy is transferred to Tirunelveli and by this Raavan gets surprised as they were not able to make transfer elsewhere. Meanwhile, Viswanathan initially disapproves of Ram and Diya's love, but he later accepts it. Ram kills Devendra and Mahendra after an accident caused by them in Devendra's cracker factory to prevent Ram from seizing illegal extortion money of Raavana, which kills many innocent workers, as well as pregnant women. Sammy challenges Raavana to take revenge for this incidence. Raavan's goons hit the car of Sammy's colleague. Sammy threats Perumal to kill by 10 pm. Sammy kills perumal with a gun. Raavana's goons continue to kill people of Tirunelveli. Viswanathan makes a plan to resign from politics. In retribution, Raavana and his henchmen orchestrate a train accident which kills Viswanathan. Ram finds out that Raavana is planning to go to Pakistan via Gujarat and Rajasthan, so he tracks him down. After a bitter fight, Ram subdues Raavana but decides to leave him to his fate in the middle of the Thar Desert with no man, town, village, or water source for several hundreds of kilometres. As the credits roll, Ram lies to the media that Raavana had left to Sri Lanka due to fear of being killed. There is a record of Raavana, going to Sri Lanka, but there is no record of coming back to India. Whereas, Raavana dies after 17 days in the desert. Soon, Ram and Diya marry.

It is headquartered in Scourie, Sutherland in north-west Scotland and has just over 100 employees. The company owns and operates eight sea sites and two hatcheries in Sutherland and the Outer Hebrides. Sales, marketing and finance departments are located in Montrose and a French sales and marketing office in Lorient, Brittany. The company harvests approximately 5,000 tonnes of fresh salmon annually. Following a ruling in 2019 by the Advertising Standards Authority, Loch Duart Ltd agreed to drop the \\"sustainable\\" claim from their marketing. Loch Duart has teamed up with New Zealand-based firm Oritain to fight the illegal food fraud trade. By using technology which takes trace elements from the loch in which it's farmed, they can match salmon taken from any market in the world and work out whether it is Loch Duart salmon.  Background  The company established in 1999 by three founders, Nick Joy, Alan Balfour and Andy Bing. The company took over some of Scotland‚Äôs oldest sea sites in Badcall Bay and nearby, formerly operated by J. Johnston & Sons, with an initial production capacity of 1,800 tonnes p.a. the company produces 5,000 tonnes of fresh salmon annually, generating annual sales of over ¬£25 million.  Farming system  Loch Duart worked with the RSPCA to develop a Freedom Food farmed salmon approval scheme, becoming the first farm to be approved. = Husbandry = A lower than standard stocking density for salmon at sea. Peak density is 1.5% fish and 98.5% water*. Handling of fish (known to cause stress) is minimised, especially at harvest when humane methods are used. The Swimthrough. Nets are raised for natural cleansing, avoiding the use of anti-foulants = Feed = Proprietary feed formulation with high fish and fish oil content (salmon are carnivores) from the Icelandic capelin fishery and other sustainable sources, GM free and rigorously tested for contaminants. = Antibiotics = Total avoidance of antibiotics and minimal use of other medicines. = Fallowing = Each site is left fallow for a period of 5 to 12 months after each cycle. The pens are removed, as are all traces of farming, allowing natural regeneration of the seabed. This results in production levels roughly half the capacity possible under more intensive regimes but creates a near pristine environment for the smolt when they are brought to sea. Example of pens having been removed during a fallow period = Anti-foulants = No use of chemical anti-foulants on pens and nets by using a swim-through system. This allows a fouled net to be pulled up while the fish swim through to the next net and allowed to dry so that marine organisms (seaweed, mussels etc.) dry out and fall back into the water. This reduces production capacity by 5 ‚Äì 8% according to site configuration. = Sea lice control = A proprietary drum filtering system removes lice and eggs during grading and harvesting. A variety of methods to control sea lice have been researched and implemented including the breeding and deployment of cleaner fish (wrasse and lumpfish) which feed on sea lice. Chemical treatments have been used frequently in the past. With all information being available on SEPA's Scottish Pollutant Release Inventory.  Farming issues  Playthings for young salmon Like every sea farm, Loch Duart has had its lessons to learn. There were several escapes during the early years, the result of storm damage and seal attacks, which have required improvements to moorings and net materials and construction. Vulnerability to human activities and nature is unavoidable. This was underlined in 2009 when a massive oil spill in Loch Carnan resulted in the loss of close to one million fish and in 2014 when a giant shoal of jellyfish got through nets in Loch Maddy, leading to the death of 300,000 young salmon. Seal predation caused significant losses for a number of years, especially as the seal population grew, but, where sea currents and pen shape allow, a box- style anti-predator net is deployed. This has had the unexpected secondary effect of creating a safe haven for sea life ‚Äì especially small mackerel, saithe and herring, which can now be seen in the predator-free areas created by the double-netting system. Fin nipping by young fish, the result of boredom and bullying in hatchery tanks, has threatened the quality of life of the salmon population and is being solved by the development of artificial reefs and playthings. Farmers both at sea and on land refer to this as ‚Äòenvironment enrichment‚Äô. The company entered the smoked salmon market by acquiring the Salar Smokehouse on South Uist in the Outer Hebridesin 2014 the smokehouse was returned to local ownership.  Markets  A Loch Duart salmon box The company exports over 60% of its production to France where it maintains its own office, the USA via Cleanfish Inc, the San Francisco ‚Äì based distributor which has made provenance and quality its major issues, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Austria, Spain, Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong. Strand Foods, an LA based company also distributes Loch Duart Salmon. Loch Duart has achieved the unusual feat of establishing a primary (and unprocessed) food product ‚Äì whole fresh salmon ‚Äì as a premium international brand*. Celebrity and Michelin-starred chefs, such as Gordon Ramsay, Raymond Blanc and Rick Stein, have featured the Loch Duart brand on their menus. Loch Duart salmon was served at the dinner at Buckingham Palace following the Royal Wedding in 2011 and at the Queens‚Äô Jubilee Luncheon in the City of London. In 2014, the company announced a deal to sell waste products to a London-based nutrition company.

Laura abandons her medical studies, goes to work in a factory and accepts a marriage proposal from Felix Shaw on the understanding that he will also look after her sister. But Felix is an attention-hungry tyrant with a lack of empathy who sets out to belittle, gaslight and demean the two sisters at every opportunity.

In 1921 she became an activist in the matter of a plebiscite about Upper Silesia joining the rest of a newly independent Second Polish Republic.

During World War II, Rosa Bailly organised assistance for Polish prisoners of war and soldiers in France. She continued her Polish contacts after the war and well into retirement, but the intensity and the welcome had waned with the advent of Polish communism. She visited there one last time in 1959 and wrote a history of Warsaw. She was also a great lover of the Pyrenees and finally settled in that region. She died in Pau in 1976, aged 86.

Voters rejected the ballot question by a margin of 77% to 23%. Ballot question The ballot question reads: > Do you approve amending the Constitution to permit casino gambling in two > additional counties in this State? At present, casino gambling is allowed > only in Atlantic City in Atlantic County. Only one casino in each of the two > counties would be permitted. Each casino is to be located in a town that is > at least 72 miles from Atlantic City. The amendment would allow certain > persons to apply first for a casino license. The proposed New Jersey Casino Expansion Amendment resulted from an agreement among Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic state legislators. State legislators were in deadlock over who would be allowed to own new casinos and tax revenue sharing. The measure does not say where the casinos would be allowed. Location and other matters such as tax rates would be determined by enabling legislation to be passed by the state legislature. A law passed by popular vote in 1976 gives Atlantic City a monopoly on casino gambling in New Jersey. Current holders of casino licenses in Atlantic City would have six months to draft proposals for two casinos in the northern area of the state. Each casino proposal would have to include an investment of at least $1 billion. If the state failed to receive proposals under those guidelines within six months, license holders outside of Atlantic City would be permitted to submit proposals Economic impact An analysis by Fitch, a credit-rating agency, determined that as many as four of Atlantic City's eight casinos would be bankrupted by expanding casino gambling outside the city. Supporters of gambling in North Jersey say that the measure would help Atlantic City by redirecting as much as $200 million a year in tax revenue to the city. Opponents say that it is unlikely that much revenue would be generated and that it would not make up for the losses due to new competition. In recent years four Atlantic City casinos have closed, causing severe economic problems. Reception =Opposition= Don Guardian, Atlantic City's mayor, said, \\"People don't just come to Atlantic City for gambling. ... They come for the spas, the restaurants, the nightclubs. If you cut half the casinos out, you would lose half the tax revenue that's going to the state.\\" Debra DiLorenzo, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Southern New Jersey, said, \\"If you vote for this, 23,000 to 30,000 families are going to be out of work. ... How does that help our state? That's a punch to the gut\\" Jim Whelan, a state senator, said that he was disappointed with the final version amendment and that the new casinos would damage casinos in Atlantic City. He expressed frustration that the companies most likely to benefit from the amendment were two out-of-state concerns, MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment. Bob McDevitt, local president the Unite-HERE casino workers union, said, > We're not asking for their stadiums, office parks, chemical plants or big > pharma to be brought to south Jersey. ... We just want to be left alone. > We've gone through a decade of crisis after crisis, from casino competition > in neighboring states to the collapse of the economy to Superstorm Sandy to > the casino closings in 2014 to the proposed state takeover. I don't know how > many more of these we can stand. In an editorial The Star-Ledger said of state legislators who support the amendment, > They are pushing parochial interests, moving to lure casinos to their home > counties even as experts warn that the market is close to saturation. They > are charging ahead without nailing down plans to protect Atlantic City. And > they are not close to settling on a rational tax scheme for the new casinos. The governing bodies of Freehold Borough and Oceanport announced their opposition of the amendment because it will prevent the Freehold Raceway and the Monmouth Park Racetrack from having casino gambling in their facilities. Jay Coffey, Oceanport's mayor, said, > Other states have gaming facilities at racetracks and New Jersey doesn't. > Instead of emulating what these states are doing (smaller, numerous, more > conveniently located venues with multi-faceted revenue streams), our state > legislators have decided to double down on the business model (Atlantic > City's) that isn't working and they want to do it on a grand scale. =Support= After numerous polls showed that Question 1 had no chance to pass, Jeffrey Gural and Paul Fireman pulled their financial support for the measure. Bill Cortese, the leader of Trenton's Bad Bet, a group opposed to the question, said, \\"Trenton's Bad Bet will not be distracted by billionaire developers throwing temper tantrums because they don't get what they want.\\" Gural blamed the failure of Question 1 on the general political climate and said that he might sponsor a similar ballot measure in 2018. Gural and Fireman, through companies they control, were the sole financial backers of Our Turn NJ, a political committee formed to support the amendment. Both donated about $5 million. Our Turn NJ spent about $8.5 million before abandoning its campaign. =Polling= Poll results announced by Stockton University on September 30, 2016 showed that 68 percent of likely voters opposed the question, 27 percent supported it, and 5 percent were undecided.

The father of Jamshyd Godrej, the Managing Director & Chairman of Godrej & Boyce, Naval was the youngest son of Pirojsha Burjorji Godrej - an Indian industrialist who was the younger brother of Ardeshir Godrej, the founder of the Godrej Group. The Godrej Group is celebrating Naval‚Äôs Birth Centenary year from 3 December 2016 ‚Äì 2 December 2017. Driven by the dream of India‚Äôs industrial self-reliance, and an ardent believer of Make in India even before the phrase became popular, Naval pioneered the all-Indian manufacture of a number of products including typewriters, machine tools, forklift trucks and refrigerators. A self-taught man, Naval was a mechanical genius. His natural affinity for machines led him to develop the Godrej Tool Room and to initiate the manufacturing of indigenous products that would go on to make Godrej a trustworthy, household name. He was also instrumental in setting up the Indian Machine Tools Association and established an international exhibition of machine tool manufacturers, IMTEX. He was the President of IMTMA from 1971 to 1973. It was his forward-thinking and vision that led to Godrej partnering with ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). With the expertise of the tool room and Naval‚Äôs support, Godrej got its first order to manufacture satellite components from ISRO in 1986 and since then there has been no looking back. In keeping with the Godrej family‚Äôs deep commitment to social welfare Naval played a leading role in setting up the Industrial garden township of Piroshanagar. He also initiated the Foundation for Research in Community Health, the Foundation for Medical Research (that focused on leprosy treatment) and supported hospitals, clinics and schools in Mumbai and elsewhere. In recognition of his service to society and to the nation, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan in 1976.  Early life  Naval was just three years old when his mother passed away. Soonabai was affected by the Asian Flu and was admitted to Cottage Hospital in Mussoorie where she succumbed to her illness on 13 June 1920. All the Godrej children were schooling in Mussoorie at that time with the oldest, Sohrab, being just 8 years old. When their mother died, the children were sent to Karachi to be looked after by their grandmother. Naval studied at St. Patrick‚Äôs School in Karachi, followed by St. Mary‚Äôs High School - once they moved back to Mumbai (then Bombay). Naval had an extremely curious mind and few things thrilled him more than taking apart a watch and putting it together again. Pirojsha noticed this mechanical aptitude and asked Naval to come and see the factory during his holidays, after his matriculation. Naval joined the business straight out of high school. Even though Naval never had any formal college education, he was willing to learn and had a keen sense of observation, and a flair for machines. He was hardly ever seen at his desk, preferring to be on the shop floor with his people. By working shoulder to shoulder with his factory workers, he not only picked up the nuances of engineering and manufacturing, but also earned the respect of his peers and workers.  Career  Naval's interest in machines led him to develop the Godrej Tool Room, and to initiate the typewriter and refrigeration lines of business. He guided the Machine Tool Association through its formative years and was its President from 1971-73. He also established the pioneering international exhibition, IMTEX where the Machine Tool industry showcases products. He was involved with the construction of the Godrej Industrial garden township in Vikhroli.  Personal life  Naval had two children, Jamshyd and Smita Crishna-Godrej. He died on 8 August 1990 at his residence in Bombay (now Mumbai), aged 73.  Naval‚Äôs Personality  Simple in attire and demeanor, Naval was a true Gandhian. Blessed with a winsome smile, he was known to be very humble, extremely approachable, and friendly. His gentle charisma and clarity shone through in his interactions with people from all walks of life. Learning skills from the shop floor upwards led Naval to support a hands-on approach in tackling problems, never expecting others to do what he would not undertake himself. Naval had no interest in partying and idle conversation. He was a family man who had a love for the sea. His passion for sailing made him establish the Godrej trophy, which is awarded every year by member clubs of the Yachting Association of India. He also helped set up a boating station for Sea Cadet Corps dedicated to the training of young boys and girls. In 1967, Naval accompanied by his wife Soonu and a few others sailed to Karachi and back. For this feat, Naval‚Äôsname was inscribed on the prestigious Scovell Challenge Shield.  Awards  He received the Padma Bhushan award in 1976, in the field of Trade & Industry.  Professional Achievements  = The Tool Room and Machine Tools = Much importance has been given to the country‚Äôs industrialisation even before freedom was won (1947), but credit must be given to Naval for taking the initiative in manufacturing machine tools nearly a decade earlier. The opportunity came during the war years when the machines required by Godrej could no longer be imported. Naval rose to the challenge and in the 1940s, he created a path- breaking line of machines including the first 35 tonne power press. He also pioneered the indigenous manufacture of machine tools & metal forming and machine cutting machines. = The First All-Indian Typewriter = Before Naval‚Äôs efforts, typewriters had never been made anywhere in Asia. Typewriter manufacturing required highly specialised machinery and deft workmanship. Even though Naval conceived the idea of typewriter manufacture as early as 1946, production started only in the early 1950s due to raw material restrictions and wartime considerations. The first all-Indian typewriter was introduced in 1955. However, mastering the manufacture of typewriters was no easy task. It took several models before Naval was satisfied with the soft touch of the keys ‚Äì a feature that made the typist‚Äôs job easier. In so much, the success of Godrej typewriters led to foreign competition downing their shutters in Indi(c) = The Refrigerator Manufacture = Having been the first to make typewriters, Naval was keen to help Indian households access other modern conveniences. After overcoming many teething problems, Godrej was successful in producing the first 230 Volt Model 9 refrigerator, having a capacity of 7.3 cubic feet, in 1958. For more than a decade, several different models were introduced. In 1962, Godrej, which had been using the imported GEC compressor unit, began manufacturing hermetically sealed compressors in India. = IMTEX and IMTMA = With his experience in manufacturing the largest number of sheet-metal machines, Naval was the obvious choice to guide the Indian Machine Tools Manufacturing Association (IMTMA) through its formative years. When Naval became its President (1971-1973), he established the pioneering International Machine Tool Exhibition known as IMTEX. Naval not only donated the land for the purpose of hosting the exhibition but was involved in every aspect of its planning, projection and execution. The first exhibition was held in 1965 with ten exhibitors while the last one (1989) in his lifetime had 400 participants. The 50th edition of IMTEX is slated to be held in two years from now. = Manufacturing of Indigenous Forklift Trucks = For Godrej, as for India, the 50s and 60s were a period of transformation ‚Äìwhere Godrej not only introduced new products locally but was keen to tap global markets. Among the new products that were added to the Godrej portfolio during this phase, were forklift trucks. With production beginning in 1961, forklift trucks of 2.25 tonne capacity were ready to be marketed by 1963. The first major breakthrough came in 1977 when Godrej bagged the first export order for forklift trucks from Russia with Naval himself signing the agreement. = Partnering with ISRO = The Process Equipment Division (PED) for fabricating equipment for process industries was established in 1976. With the expertise of the tool room and Naval‚Äôs support, PED actively began considering the idea of venturing into the space arena. In 1986, PED got its first order to manufacture satellite components from ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). This order lead to the establishment of the Precision Components Group (PCG) that was then solely dedicated to the manufacture and design of satellite components. The following year, Godrej received the first order for the Dummy Motor Casing for PSLV. The success of the project led to the creation of a dedicated business unit, Godrej Aerospace, that began the fabrication and supply of the Vikas Engines in its entirety. The first delivery of the Vikas engine was done in 1994. Since then Godrej Aerospace has regularly and successfully supplied mission-critical components for ISRO‚Äôs ambitious, indigenous space programme. Later, once we have the facts, we must include the point about taking on foreign competition and beating the global majors.  Social Welfare  Naval‚Äôs contribution to India was in line with the concept of trusteeship of wealth initiated by his uncle Ardeshir who donated a sum of Rs 3 lakhs to the Tilak Swaraj Fund way back in 1921. Mahatma Gandhi was so touched by the gesture that he wrote effusively about it (Collected Works, Volume 20). Naval initiated the Foundation for Research in Community Health (FRCH) ‚Äì a part of the Pirojsha Godrej Foundation. A regular visitor to Mandwa, Naval saw the problems of the locals first hand and initiated the Mandwa Project which included a Primary Health Care Centre. Naval would personally visit the Centre every weekend and sit under a tree spending several hours discussing with the villagers what improvements could be made to the centre and the village. Naval also initiated the Foundation or Medical Research (FMR) with the goal of eradicating leprosy. The fledgling project grew from modest beginnings to a well-equipped laboratory and educational institute. While he supported clinics, schools and hospitals in Mumbai and elsewhere, his other philanthropic contributions included a crematorium for pets and a Disaster Centre. = Pirojshanagar - The Industrial Garden Township = Naval was deeply involved in the conceptualization and development of the Godrej Industrial Garden Township at Vikhroli in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Instead of taking the easy way out and getting an established contractor, Pirojsha Godrej decided to entrust the entire work to Naval. Initially confined to planning, by 1972 Naval was involved in the total execution of the project. Emphasis was laid on the adoption of quality systems from residential construction and industrial to infrastructure, gardens and forestry. Right from its inception, Naval laid down an ‚ÄòEnvironmental Policy‚Äô that governed all aspects of construction, waste management and landscaping. In the attention they gave to environmental concerns, Godrej was well ahead of other industries at that time. As regards housing for workers, Naval would sit with architects himself and look into even the smallest of points such as adequate cross ventilation. Nearly 1,800 acres of land are preserved mangrove swamps managed by the Soonbai Pirojsha Godrej trust. The elegantly laid out Pirojshahnagar is today as much a garden as an industrial township and incorporates many facilities for workers and families such as the Udayachal Schools among others. = The Parsi Punchayat = Naval joined the Parsi Punchayat in February 1985. Naval was convinced that with the sizeable resources at its disposal, the Punchayat could do much more for the Parsi community. Housing, education and the upliftment of Mobeds (priests) were of prime importance to him as was the growing rate of unemployment. One outcome of Naval‚Äôs joining the Parsi Punchayat was the community managed to get a Godrej Baug at Peddar Road, Mumbai which fulfilled one of the community‚Äôs most dire need - housing.

His series are considered among the best of those written to oppose adoption of the proposed constitution.Ann Stuart Diamond, \\"The Anti-Federalist \\"Brutus,\\" Political Science Reviewer 6 (Fall 1976). p. 249 They paralleled and confronted The Federalist Papers during the ratification fight over the Constitution. Brutus published 16 essays in the New-York Journal, and Weekly Register from October, 1787, through April, 1788, beginning shortly before The Federalist started appearing in New York newspapers. The essays were widely reprinted and commented on throughout the American states. All 16 of the essays were addressed to \\"the Citizens of the State of New York. The true identity of Brutus is unknown, but modern scholarship has suggested both Melancton Smith of PoughkeepsieZuckert and Webb. The Anti-Federalist Writings of the Melancton Smith Circle p. xxviii-xxix (2009). and John Williams of Salem.Johnson, Joel. \\"'Brutus' and 'Cato' Unmasked: General John Williams's Role in the New York Ratification Debate\\",(American Antiquarian Society, 2009). A computational analysis of the known writings of Smith suggests that either he or an associate was the author of the Brutus papers, though there are strong similarities between the works of Williams and Brutus. The pen name is in honor of either Lucius Junius Brutus who led the overthrow of the last Roman King Tarquinius Superbus or else Marcus Junius Brutus, who was one of Julius Caesar's assassins. Arguments against the Constitution =The people's liberties= Like other Anti-Federalist writers, he argued that a bill of rights was necessary to protect the people from the government. He urged the people of New York not to ratify the Constitution and therefore give up powers to the government because \\"when the people once part with power, they can seldom or never resume it again but by force.\\" In his view, Americans believe ‚Äúthat all men by nature are free‚Äù and the new Constitution requires them to give up too many rights which ‚Äúcounteracts the very end of government.‚Äù To alleviate this issue, a bill of rights that considers criminal rights, free elections, and freedom of press must be included. =Legislative branch= Powers Brutus writes that Congress possesses far too much power, especially over the states. He prefers a true confederation, which would be: a number of independent states entering , for conducting certain general concerns, in which they have a common interest, leaving the management of their internal and local affairs to go and their separate governments.‚Äù He believes the power to hold a standing army in peacetime as evil and highly dangerous to public liberty. Congress‚Äô unlimited power to collect revenue and to ‚Äú\\"borrow money on the credit of the United States‚Äù as well as the Necessary and Proper Clause, are highly dangerous to the states, and Brutus believes they will eventually be dissolved if the Constitution is adopted. Representation Brutus argues that a free republic cannot exist in such a large territory as the United States. He uses the examples of the Greek and Roman republics that became tyrannical as their territory grew. He states that a true free republic comes from the people, not representatives of the people. With the population and geographical size of the United States, he warns that citizens ‚Äúwill have very little acquaintance with those who may be chosen to represent them; a great part of them will, probably, not know the characters of their own members, much less that of a majority of those who will compose the federal assembly; they will consist of men, whose names they have never heard, and whose talents and regard for the public good, they are total strangers to.‚Äù He also sees danger in giving Congress the power to modify the election of its own members. Brutus also questions the validity of the Three Fifths Compromise and asks ‚Äú‚ÄúIf [slaves] have no share in government. why is the number of members in the assembly, to be increased on their account?‚Äù He sees this as one example of the corruption of the branch. The fact that each state, regardless of size, will have the same number of senators \\"is the only feature of any importance in the constitution of a confederated government\\" and, is one of the few aspects of the legislature that Brutus approves of (16). He disagrees with the method of electing senators as well as the six- year term they are given as he believes spending that much time away from his constituents will make him less in touch with their interests (16). He advocates for a rotation in government to avoid the problem of men serving in the Senate for life. He also objects to Congress taking part in appointing officers and impeachment as it gives them both executive and judicial powers and he deems such blurring of the branches as dangerous (16). Judiciary branch Brutus argues that the power given to the judiciary will: * Extend legislative authority * Increase jurisdiction of the courts * Diminish and destroy both the legislative and judiciary powers of the states. He believes that their ability to declare what the powers of the legislature will lead to extension of legislative power, especially because the Supreme Court can interpret the Constitution according to its \\"spirit and reason\\" and will not be bound by its words alone. Like in Britain, this will allow them to \\"mold the government into almost any shape they please.\\" Also, their ability to deem the validity of state legislation overrides the state judiciaries and will eventually make them so \\"trifling and unimportant, as not to be worth having.‚Äù He also thinks there should be more checks on the branch and judges should not only be removed on the basis of crime. He writes \\"no way is left to control them but with a high hand and an outstretched arm.‚Äù Notes External links * Writings of Brutus scan * Writings of Brutus html 18th-century American writers Anti-Federalists Anti-Federalist Papers ","title":"Brutus (Antifederalist)"},{"id":"51236000","text":"The Quaker City; or, The Monks of Monk Hall is a city mystery novel by Philadelphia writer George Lippard, first published in 1845. Plot summary The Quaker City describes four main characters during the course of three days and nights. The story is set mostly in a Philadelphia mansion named \\"Monk Hall\\", which serves as a private gentlemen's club and is also secretly a brothel and opium den patronized by some of the city's most respected citizens. The main characters engage in various acts of debauchery, including the attempt at deflowering a young maiden. Devil-Bug, one of the book's most memorable characters, serves as the hall's caretaker and doorman. Inspiration The Quaker City is based partly on the March 1843 New Jersey trial of Singleton Mercer.Cleman, John. \\"Irresistible Impulses: Edgar Allan Poe and the Insanity Defense\\", collected in Bloom's BioCritiques: Edgar Allan Poe, edited by Harold Bloom. Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2001: 67 Mercer was accused of the murder of Mahlon Hutchinson Heberton aboard the Philadelphia-Camden ferry vessel Dido on February 10, 1843. Mercer alleged that Heberton, only five days before he shot him, had lured his sixteen-year old sister into a brothel and raped her at gunpoint. He entered a plea of insanity and was found not guilty. The trial occurred only two months after Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", a story based on other murder trials employing the insanity defense; Mercer's defense attorney acknowledged the \\"object of ridicule\\" which an insanity defense had become. Nonetheless, a verdict of not-guilty was rendered after less than an hour of jury deliberation, and the family and the lawyer of young Mercer were greeted by a cheering crowd while disembarking from the same Philadelphia-Camden ferry line on which the killing occurred. Lippard employed the seduction aspect of the trial as a metaphor for the oppression of the helpless. Publication history The Quaker City was the best-selling novel in America before Uncle Tom's Cabin.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 211. When it appeared in print during 1845, it sold 60,000 copies during its first year and at least 10,000 copies throughout the next decade.Reynolds, David.

Lippard took advantage of the popularity of his novel The Quaker City to establish his own weekly periodical, also named The Quaker City. He advertised it as \\"A Popular Journal, devoted to such matters of Literature and news as will interest the great mass of readers\\".Streeby, Shelley.

American Sensations: Class, Empire, and the Production of Popular Culture. University of California Press, 2002: 44. Analysis In The Quaker City; or; The Monks of Monks Hall, Lippard intended to expose the hypocrisy of the Philadelphia elite as well as the darker underside of American capitalism and urbanization. Lippard's Philadelphia is populated with parsimonious bankers, foppish drunkards, adulterers, sadistic murderers, reverend rakes, and confidence men, all of whom the author depicts as potential threats to the Republic. It is considered the first muckraking novel.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 205. Critical response Many people were offended by the story's lurid elements. The book may also have prompted new laws, such as New York's 1849 enactment of an anti-seduction law. The Monks of Monk Hall outraged some readers with its lingering descriptions of \\"heaving bosoms\\" but such descriptions also drew readers and increased book sales. A stage version was prepared but banned in Philadelphia for fear of riots.

He was the spokesperson for Boko Haram before it pledged allegiance to ISIL. Early life He is the eldest surviving son of the founder of Boko Haram, Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram On 27 January 2015, he released a propaganda video as the spokesman for Boko Haram. Islamic State On 7 March 2015, Abubakar Shekau released an audio message in which he pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the Islamic State. Abubakar Shekau was reaffirmed as the leader of the branch in an ISIL video released in April 2016. On 21 June 2016, Reuters reported Marine Lieutenant General Thomas Waldhauser as saying \\"Several months ago, about half of Boko Haram broke off to a separate group because they were not happy with the amount of buy-in, if you will, from Boko Haram into the ISIL brand,\\" Shekau ignored ISIL orders to stop using children as suicide bombers. \\"He's been told by ISIL to stop doing that. But he has not done so. And that's one of the reasons why this splinter group has broken off,\\" he said, adding Islamic State was trying to \\"reconcile those two groups.\\" On 3 August 2016, the Islamic State reported in the 41st issue of its newspaper al-Naba, that Abu Musab al-Barnawi had been appointed as the new leader of their West African branch. In response, Shekau declared that he and his followers were in the right, and that \\"[they] will not accept any emissary except the one we can attest he is sincere and truthful for Allah and His cause\\". Al-Barnawi promised in an interview with al-Naba that he would not target mosques or markets in northern Nigeria. The difference in these approaches is due to Barnawi considering the general population in the region to be Muslim whereas Shekau considered them to be non-believers. On 27 February 2018, he was made a 'Specially Designated National' by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control. In March 2019, rumours began to circulate according to which Abu Musab had been replaced by Abu Abdullah Idris ibn Umar al-Barnawi as the governor of the West African province. Neither the Islamic State's top leadership, nor members of its West Africa branch officially commented the claims, resulting in speculations about the reported dismissal. Some argued that he had possibly been overthrown as part of an internal power struggle, while the Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF) claimed that he had been fired by the Islamic State's top command due to a number of defeats of his forces at the hands of MJTF.

It was written by Banks, Jesse Rogg, Tim Anderson, Dacoury Natche, Aron Forbes and it was produced by the latter three. Some of the song's lyrics were initially written when Banks was fourteen. \\"Trainwreck\\" garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. To promote the song, an accompanying music video for the track was released on January 18, 2017. Composition Banks wrote the verses for \\"Trainwreck\\" when she was fourteen. During an interview for Idolator, she said: \\"They stayed in my head! It was like a chant. I do remember writing it‚ÄîI wrote it down in a notebook. I always remember those lyrics, though. There are some lyrics that I've written that I always will remember.\\" The song is an electropop song with rap influences, and she described the lyrics as a \\"stream of consciousness\\". According to Kellan Miller of Drowned in Sound, \\"Banks is hardly stuck in the victim role, as many songs feature her spoon‚àífeeding hard doses of perspective and truth down her ex‚àílovers' throats.\\" Critical reception \\"Trainwreck\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Pitchfork Media said that \\"Trainwreck\\" evokes, to great effect, the particular darkness that was all over pop radio in the early '10s [...] blown‚àíout vocals, big menacing synth pads, barely concealed panic. Shahzaib Hussain of Clash described the song as \\"a dizzying, trap‚àíesque affair abiding more by pop conventions‚Äîintentional or not, it's a track that melds breakneck rhythm, vocal malleability and production value seamlessly, a template the LA artist should have utilised more of.\\" Jamie Milton from DIY labeled the song as \\"a hit-and-miss-but-nice-one-for-trying rap verse\\". Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic described \\"Trainwreck\\" and \\"This Is Not About Us\\" as exciting hip‚àíhop moments that pop and rumble. Kellan Miller of Drowned in Sound said that \\"Trainwreck\\" finds her even more self‚àídeprecating, partly blaming herself for a relationship gone awry. Andrew Paschal of PopMatters said that \\"Banks crams rapid‚àífire syllables into verses, seeming to almost emulate the poetic style of Ani DiFranco or Joni Mitchell but lacking entirely the stripped down candidness of those artists, sounding more like a Meghan Trainor throwaway instead.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Maura Johnston expressed that \\"Trainwreck\\" combines rapid‚àífire lyrics about escaping a bad‚àínews boyfriend, with hand claps, as if she's at the center of a supportive drum‚àímachine circle, and the emancipation‚àíminded. Sputnikmusic labeled the song as \\"the most immediate song on the album\\", also adding \\"Banks' delivery is almost rap‚àílike, and she goes head to head with some major league electropop hooks. There is a gravity to the production here that maybe was lacking on Goddess\\". Promotion =Music video= The video for \\"Trainwreck\\" was directed by Marie Schuller. It was released on January 18, 2017, via Banks' VEVO channel. The video starts with various black-and-white footages of Banks on a TV screen and three unknown men in suits. In the next scenes, Banks is seen at a table with a raven on her head. She starts eating a peeled egg and she spits it out into a milk glass while the three unknown men are filming her. The music video ends with Banks' on top of one of the unknown men, she stomps on his head and it deflates, making a squeaky toy noise. DIY called it \\"an uncomfortable, fast‚àípaced nightmare, and Banks' most conceptual video to date.\\" Gabriel Aikins from Substream Magazine described it as \\"darkly weird and memorable\\", while Kirsten Spruch from Baeble Music said that \\"although it's creepy as hell, Banks' artistic vision is very real and true\\".

He played college basketball for University of South Dakota and Buena Vista University. He was previously an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns from 2015‚Äì2017 and the Toronto Raptors from 2018‚Äì2020. Early life and college career Bjorkgren was born in Storm Lake, Iowa on June 20, 1975. When Bjorkgren started playing basketball in college, he first began by playing for the University of South Dakota in 1994. After a couple of seasons playing there, he decided to transfer to Buena Vista University in his hometown. During his time there, Bjorkgren helped Buena Vista out in gaining the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Championship in their 1996‚Äì97 season. At the time, it was the university's first conference championship earned since 1976. He eventually graduated in 1998 with a degree in Exercise Science. Coaching career =High school coaching career= Began his high school coaching career at Linn-Mar High School in Marion, IA, under head coach Mark Hutcheson as a head coach of the Sophomore team and assistant to the varsity team in 1998 until moving to Arizona.https://www.thegazette.com/subject/sports/former-linn-mar-assistant- nate-bjorkgren-enjoying-life-in-nba-20191206 Four years after graduating from Buena Vista University, Bjorkgren moved out to Phoenix, Arizona. It was there that he began his tenure on coaching basketball. From 2004 to 2007, Bjorkgren began his coaching career with Cactus Shadows High School in Cave Creek, Arizona. During each of his three seasons with Cactus Shadows, he led the Falcons to the Cactus 4A State Tournament. In addition, he also was named both the Regional Coach of the Year during the 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 seasons and the Arizona State High School Coach of the Year for the 2005‚Äì06 season. =Professional coaching career= D-League After his third and final season at Cactus Shadows High School, Bjorkgren was called up in 2007 for an assistant coach role under Nick Nurse's coaching staff for a new expansion D-League team with his home state's Iowa Energy. During his last season as assistant coach for Iowa, Bjorkgren made his coaching debut in the D-League under an overtime victory for the Energy. Under his last season as assistant coach for the Energy, the team won their first ever D-League championship with his assistance at hand. That led to the Dakota Wizards to call upon Bjorkgren's service as the team's new head coach. During the Wizards' last season under the Dakota name, he coached the team to an improved 29‚Äì21 record after having a 19‚Äì31 record the previous season before losing in the first round to the Bakersfield Jam. After that, the Dakota Wizards changed their name to the Santa Cruz Warriors due to the Golden State Warriors gaining complete control over the franchise by that point. Under their first season with the Warriors name, Bjorkgren improved the team even further, managing the team to the point where they made it to their first D-League Finals as the Warriors, before eventually losing to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers 2-0. Before trying again with the Warriors, Bjorkgren signed a new deal to return to the Iowa Energy as their head coach. In his only season there, Bjorkgren improved the Energy from a 14‚Äì36 record to a more improved 31‚Äì19 record, which helped him gain recognition by scouts as a potential NBA head coach someday. After losing out to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers once again, Bjorkgren signed up to a new deal to coach the Bakersfield Jam. During his only season coaching the Jam, he also improved the team, managing to go from an average 24‚Äì26 record to a more improved 34‚Äì16 record. While he helped his players earn multiple honors that season, the Jam ultimately lost in the playoffs 2-1 to the Austin Spurs in the first round. NBA On July 30, 2015, Bjorkgren got promoted to the NBA by being named both an assistant coach and the leading player development coordinator for the Phoenix Suns under head coach Jeff Hornacek. Before being officially hired, though, he took on the head coach role for the Phoenix Suns' Summer League team in the 2015 NBA Summer League, where he led the team to a 5-2 record, making it to the Las Vegas Finals before losing to the San Antonio Spurs. Under his debut season, he went from being both an assistant head coach and player development coordinator to a full-time assistant coach after both assistant coaches Jerry Sichting and Mike Longabardi were fired by December 28, 2015. With the coaching staff undermanned and the Suns performing poorly due, at least in part, to injuries involving some of their key players, it ultimately led to Jeff Hornacek being fired by February 1, 2016, after finishing the month of January with a 2-12 record. Bjorkgren was immediately considered a prime candidate to take over the vacant coaching spot before the position was ultimately given to Earl Watson. However, despite performing under one of the worst seasons in franchise history, Bjorkgren continued to remain as a part of Earl Watson's newest coaching staff, being one of only two members of Earl Watson's original staff to remain there after the 2015-16 NBA season ended. Bjorkgren also took on the role of the Suns' Summer League coach once again for the 2016 NBA Summer League, this time recording a 4‚Äì2 record, with the team missing out on their third Las Vegas Finals showing after losing to the #24 seeded Minnesota Timberwolves. After his second season with the Suns saw some minor improvements, Bjorkgren was removed from the team alongside player development coaches Mehmet Okur and Jason Fraser on October 22, 2017 after some poor performances led to a 0‚Äì3 start for the team's 50th anniversary season. He then became a part of the Toronto Raptors under their advanced scouting department for the rest of the season onward. In July 2018, Bjorkgren was announced as one of the newest assistant coaches for the Toronto Raptors under new head coach Nick Nurse, whom he had previously worked with under the Iowa Energy from 2007 until 2011. During his first season with Toronto, Bjorkgren reached the 2019 NBA Finals, where the Raptors bested the Golden State Warriors 4‚Äì2 in a best of seven series. He became the first assistant coach to win both an NBA Finals and NBA D-League (now NBA G League) Championship throughout a coaching career, winning both under Nick Nurse as head coach. On October 20, 2020, the Indiana Pacers hired Bjorkgren as their new head coach.

According to the Baltimore County Police Department, officers sought to serve Gaines a warrant in relation to an earlier traffic violation. She had refused to vacate her vehicle or show her driver's license, and resisted arrest. Immediately after the first officer entered her home to serve the warrant, Gaines pointed a shotgun at him, prompting him to withdraw without shots being fired. The Baltimore County SWAT team responded and a standoff began. Portions of the standoff were filmed by Gaines and posted to social-media networking sites where she can be seen loading the shotgun, announcing to all the police officers outside her house that she was attempting to protect her son and they had no right to break into her home. Upon her refusal to let them in, police got a key from the rental office but found the chain lock blocked their entry. An officer then kicked in the door. Police say Gaines pointed a shotgun at an officer, telling him to leave. Upon police request, Facebook deactivated Gaines' Facebook and Instagram accounts, leading to criticism of the company's involvement in the incident. In 2018, an all female jury awarded the Gaines family $38 million in damages after finding that the first shot, fired by Royce Ruby and killing Gaines, was not reasonable, and thus violated their civil rights. That verdict was overturned in February 2019 by Judge Mickey Norman who ruled that physical evidence suggests Gaines' was raising her weapon when shot, thus posing a threat to Ruby and his team. Judge Norman described Ruby's actions as 'objectively reasonable'.https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-county/bs-md- co-gaines-overturned-20190215-story.html Background Korryn Shandawn Gaines Korryn Gaines; findagrave.com Retrieved July 20, 2017 was a 23-year-old woman from Randallstown, Maryland, and was employed as a hairstylist.
