Ferries connect the islands to Waingapu on Sumba, Ende on Flores, and Kupang in West Timor. Flying to Savu through Susi Air from Kupang, Ende, and Waingapu is also possible.  Geography  The Savu Islands (Indonesian: Kepulauan Sawu) include Rai Hawu (or Savu), Rai Jua, and Rai Dana. The three islands are fringed by coral reefs and sandy beaches. Rai Hawu is the principal island. Rai Jua is a smaller island west of Rai Hawu. Rai Dana is a small, uninhabited island, situated 30 km southwest of Rai Jua. From April to October, deep ocean swells pound the southern coastlines. The land is covered for the most part by grassland and palms. The climate is dry for much of the year because of the hot winds which blow from Australia. The main rains fall between November and March. Between 82 and 94% of all rain falls during the west monsoon with little or no rain falling between August and October. The mean annual rainfall for Savu Island is 1,019 mm. During the dry season, many streams run dry and local inhabitants must depend on wells for their water supplies.  Vulcanism  The Savu Islands are situated in a tectonic subduction zone, where the Indo-Australian Plate is moving northward, sliding under the Eurasian Plate. The islands lie on a ridge that was created by volcanic eruptions caused by the plate movement. Sediments carried into the Earth's crust heat up and rise in plumes of magma, which cool and solidify to form igneous rock. The Sumba Ridge is no longer volcanically active, but active volcanoes are on the island of Flores, to the north. The compression of the two tectonic plates is causing the Savu Islands to rise at a rate of about 1 mm per year.Vorkink, M.W. & Harris, R.A. (2004) Tectonic Development of the Incipient Banda Arc-Continent Collision: Geologic and Kinematic Evolution of Savu Island, Indonesia. 2004 Denver Annual Meeting Occasionally, however, the tectonic plate suddenly slips a much greater distance, resulting in an earthquake. The 8.3 Sumba earthquake struck 280 km west-southwest of Rai Jua in August 1977. The shock triggered a destructive tsunami which swept across the coastal plain at Seba, reaching as high as the airport. No one was reported missing on Savu or Rai Jua. However, on the neighbouring islands of Sumba and Sumbawa, the death toll reached 180.Pararas-Carayannis, G. (1977) Indonesian Earthquake and Tsunami of August 19, 1977. Abstracted article in Tsunami Newsletter, Vol. X, No. 3. (Sept. 1977). International Tsunami Information Center ReportInteractive map showing major earthquakes in East Nusa Tenggara between 1970 and 2005 (requires Flash Player)  Society  The population is 91,870 (2009 estimate). Savu has strong historical ties with Hinduism in Java and the people consider themselves of Hindu origin. The society still performs traditional animistic beliefs, known as Djingi Tiu. Dutch missionaries introduced Protestantism which remains on the islands today. The Savunese have a traditional greeting, done by pressing one's nose (at the same time) to another person's nose at an encounter. It is used in all meetings among Savu's people and on major ceremonies, and serves a similar purpose to a formal handshake in modern western culture, and indeed is often used in conjunction with one, similar to the Hongi in New Zealand.  Administration  The group of three islands was formed (in 2008) into the Sabu Raijua Regency within East Nusa Tenggara province.  Agriculture  Savunese culture is ecologically fitting for such an arid environment. The traditional clan agreements on land control and water distribution ensure that the land is carefully managed and not overexploited. Their gardens form a well structured ecology, emulating a tropical forest with diverse species of trees and shade plants. Agricultural production on Savu includes corn, rice, roots, beans, livestock (meat/milk), and seaweed, which was introduced by Japanese interests, in the early 1990s. Pigs, goats, and chickens are commonplace in the villages. Those farmers who depend on mixed-crop gardens or on mung bean fields are generally better able to manage during times of poor rain, but are seemingly less successful when the rains are good. Corn, as a single crop, remains the predominant staple on Savu, though most farmers try to plant several different fields to increase their chances of at least one successful harvest. Cotton is the main crop on Rai Jua, where the standard of living is below that of Savu. It is used to make traditional textiles. Corn is planted in late November, December, or early January and harvested from February through March; rice and mung beans are planted later, usually in January, after soils are well saturated with rain. In El Ni√±o years, farmers are frequently misled by initial rains, which offer promise, but then cease. Most farmers keep some seed reserves if they are forced to plant a second time during the wet season. Rarely do farmers have sufficient seed reserves for a third attempt at planting, and by the time such a third planting seems necessary, little likelihood of success remains. By mid-March, the rains begin to diminish and planting corn with any expectation of a good harvest is no longer possible. Prior to the corn harvest, the poorer segments of the population survive on reserve foods, primarily cassava, some sweet potato, forest yams, and sugar supplies from tapping lontar palms. This period is known as the time of \\"ordinary hunger\\". However, during periods of drought, when the planting and subsequent harvest of the corn crop is delayed, the period of ordinary hunger is extended and \\"ordinary hunger\\" becomes \\"extraordinary hunger\\". Most families manage on one meager meal a day. Livestock, suffering from the same conditions as the human population, are consumed or sold to buy emergency foods. People turn to green papaya, eaten as a vegetable, and tamarind seeds. In the dry season, drinking water becomes difficult to obtain and is often polluted by animals seeking water. Women and younger girls spend more time than ever carrying water for their families. A strong indicator of the \\"extraordinary hunger\\" period is a sharp increase in gastrointestinal diseases. Children are particularly vulnerable. Sawu Marine National Park According to Keputusan Menteri Kelautan dan Perikanan Nomor: 38 tahun 2009 tgl 18 Mei 2009, Marine National Park (MMAF) Laut Sawu is established with MPA Code: 75 and Area Wide: 3,521,130.01 hectares which consists of: 567.170 hectares Marines of Sumba Regency, West Sumba Regency, Central Sumba Regency, Southwest Sumba Regency, Manggarai Regency, West Manggarai Regency and Marine areas of Timor-Rote-Sabu-Batek with 2,95 million hectares in East Sumba Regency, Rote Ndao Regency, Kupang Regency, South Central Timor Regency and City of Kupang. In this park are 63,339,32 hectares coral reefs with 500 species of corals, 5,019.53 ha of mangroves, 5,320.62 ha of sea grass beds, and 1,769.1 ha of estuaries. Five of six turtle species in the world also can be found in Savu Sea ecosystem, as well as 30 species of marine mammals (whales and dolphins), including the endangered sperm whale and blue whale, which are easy to find in the area and are pelagic and demersal species.  Early European contact  Initial contact was with the Dutch Vereenigde Oost-Indische Companie in 1648. References to Savu from the period invariably concern Savunese soldiers, mercenaries, or slaves. In 1674, the crew of a Dutch sloop was massacred in East Savu, after their vessel ran aground. The Dutch responded by forming an alliance with the raja of Seba, so troops could be sent in to retaliate. However, they failed to enter the fortress of Hurati, in B'olou Village of Eastern Savu, as it was ringed by three defensive walls. To save face, the Dutch force accepted payment in the form of slaves, gold, and beads. In 1770, Captain James Cook visited Savu, staying three days before continuing on to Batavia. It was the first European voyage to have scientists on board. During the three-year expedition, botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander collected over 3,500 plant species along with specimens of animals, minerals, and ethnographic materials that on their return fascinated Europeans. Cook's visit to Savu was brief, and though Banks and he produced detailed records of the island and its people, their accounts were based for the most part on information provided by Mr Lange, the German representative of the Dutch East India Company, who was stationed on Savu at the time.

Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks wrote most of the music, with the help of Peter Gabriel. Lyrically, the song tells the section of the album's story whereby Rael, the lead character, finds himself in a red carpeted corridor surrounded by kneeling people slowly crawling towards a wooden door. Rael dashes by them towards the door and goes through it. Behind the door is a table with a candlelit feast on it, and behind that, a spiral staircase that leads upwards out of sight. The song was released in April 1975 as the album's second single under the title \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\". In 1995, Genesis re-recorded the song with producer Trevor Horn that featured Gabriel and Collins sharing lead vocals, released as \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\". This marked the last time both singers recorded with Genesis, as Gabriel had left the band in 1975 and Collins quit in 1996. Releases \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" reappears on the 1976 Genesis: In Concert with Bill Bruford on drums, and on Seconds Out, Genesis's 1977 live album, with Chester Thompson on drums. It was also played on subsequent tours in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1998, 2007, and the Six of the Best reunion concert with Peter Gabriel. It was also performed once during the 1992 tour. A re-recorded version, called \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\", was released on the compilation album Turn It On Again: The Hits; this is the last recording to date by the 5-man line-up of Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford, and is also the last studio recording by any configuration of Genesis to date. Gabriel and Collins share the role of lead vocals, ultimately harmonizing toward the end of the song. Collins contributes percussion programming as well, under a more contemporary drum and bass influence. The song's final verse was planned on being sung by Genesis' third singer Ray Wilson, but he left the band so the plan was dropped and the final verse was left out. The B-sides of the 1999 single were \\"Turn It On Again\\" and \\"Follow You Follow Me\\". The song is also included as the final track of the 2007 live album Live Over Europe 2007 and on the live DVD When in Rome 2007. Performance variations On the 1974 studio version, Peter Gabriel sang an introductory verse beginning with \\"There is lambs' wool under my naked feet...\\", while from 1976 onwards Phil Collins omitted the introduction, and started the song with \\"The crawlers cover the floor...\\". This later live version omitting the introductory verse is simply referred to as \\"The Carpet Crawl\\", as it is listed on Seconds Out. The song as sung by Collins was a fixture through the 1981/1982 tours, and was played as the final encore for each date of the 2007 Turn It On Again Tour.

It operated from 1953 to 1973. History JWA under Rikid≈çzan (1953‚Äì1963) Rikid≈çzan, a former rikishi (sumo wrestling practitioner) who had debuted as a Western-style professional wrestler in 1951, decided in 1953 to establish a territory that would represent the National Wrestling Alliance in Japan. In those early days, Japanese professional wrestlers came from out of the sumo or judo ranks; former sumotori usually used their shikona (Rikid≈çzan, Azumafuji, Toyonobori, etc.) while former judokas usually used their real names or modifications of them (Masahiko Kimura, Michiaki Yoshimura, etc.) Rikid≈çzan pushed himself as the top star of the promotion, first battling other Japanese wrestlers such as Kimura and Toshio Yamaguchi, but found a strong niche in feuds with American wrestlers such as Lou Thesz, The Destroyer and Bobo Brazil. In 1957 he defeated Thesz to win the title that would be the JWA's top title thereafter, the NWA International Heavyweight Championship. As a newly found hero to the war-weary Japanese masses, Rikid≈çzan expanded into several business ventures. Sadly it would result in his murder at the hands of a gangster in 1963, at the peak of his fame. JWA after Rikid≈çzan (1963‚Äì1973) After Rikid≈çzan‚Äôs death in 1963, the company continued to operate as the nation‚Äôs premier (and only male) wrestling circuit until challenged in the late 1960s by International Wrestling Enterprise, which featured the first major World heavyweight championship based in Japan, the IWA title. The JWA's top stars, Giant Baba and Antonio Inoki left to form their own promotions (All Japan Pro Wrestling and New Japan Pro Wrestling, respectively) in 1972. With its top drawing cards gone, the JWA was therefore out of business the following year.

The 1973 edition was not held as JWA folded that year. Wrestlers from all over the world participated in the various editions of the tournament, as it was meant since its beginning to be a world tournament. It had been one of the most important pro-wrestling tournament of its time, because it was one of the very few (and for some years after its creation the only) pro-wrestling tournaments of its time to be considered representative of the entire pro-wrestling world. In 1970 JWA created a tag team counterpart of the World Big League, known as World Tag League.

World Tag League World Tag League, also known as NWA World Tag League was a professional wrestling tournament annually held by Japanese Wrestling Association from 1970 till 1972. The 1973 edition was not held as JWA folded that year. Wrestlers from all over the world participated in the various editions of the tournament, as it was meant to be a world tournament. It was created in 1970 as the tag team counterpart of World Big League. Its prestige led Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba to create in their respective promotions, New Japan Pro Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling, tournaments which were presented as the direct followers to the JWA World Tag League. Therefore, respectively, the G1 Tag League for the NJPW and the World's Strongest Tag Determination League for the AJPW are the indirect descendant of the original World Tag League. In fact, in 2012, NJPW renamed the G1 Tag League the World Tag League. The following is a list of the winners of each edition:http://www.puroresu.com/jwa/results/ * 1st World Tag League (1970): Antonio Inoki and Kantaro Hoshino by defeating Nick Bockwinkel and Big John Quinn. * 2nd World Tag League (1971): Antonio Inoki (2) and Seiji Sakaguchi by defeating Killer Kowalski and Buddy Austin. * 3rd World Tag League (1972): Seiji Sakaguchi (2) and Akihisa Takachiho by defeating Larry Hamilton and Joe Hamilton.

Marianne Wilson, is a citizen of Sweden who was the subject of a widely publicised and highly controversial case in international family law decided in the Tokyo High Court in 1956, Sweden v. Yamaguchi. Vaughn became the ward of the Swedish Ambassador to Japan, Tage Gr√∂nfall and later Frederick Almquist, and resided in the Swedish Embassy in Tokyo.  Birth and ancestry  Vaughn was born the only child of James A. Vaughn (May 7, 1925- February 3, 2003) and Vivienne Joy Wilson (November 2, 1929 ‚Äì August 5, 1950), in Bluff Hospital in Yokohama, Japan, on April 17, 1949. Her father was a US national employed under contract with the United States Military Administration of Occupied Japan. Her mother was a Swedish national, of three generations of Swedish citizens resident in Japan. She was descended from John Wilson and Sophia Wilson, former Naka Yamazaki, her grandparents, and Professor John Wilson. Vivienne Wilson had been weakened by the privations of World War II, and contracted tuberculosis during James Vaughn's absence to the United States, during which Mary Ann was cared for by a nanny, Fumi. Vivienne died on 5 August 1950, the very day of passage of private legislation permitting her to immigrate to the United States. She was buried in the Geijin Boche, the Foreign Cemetery overlooking the port in Yokohama, Japan.  Early life  After the death of her mother, Vaughn was placed under the guardianship of Professor John Wilson, with nanny Fumi Kaneko (later Fumi Yamaguchi) in custodial care. Due to the privations of the postwar period, John Wilson sailed to Sweden with his wife and children in 1952. Vaughn was to accompany them, but due to an outbreak of whooping cough, she was to sail on the next ship. However, Yamaguchi absconded with Vaughn, and Yamaguchi destroyed the child's records, raising her under claim of an abandoned American orphan in the slums of Yokohama.  Media  The story of Mary Ann Vaughn has been extensively covered by the popular press, and is of considerable interest to organizations such as the Japan Children's Rights Network ( Non-Japanese Awarded Custody of a Child in Japan).The Japan Children's Rights Network  References  Category:1947 births Category:Living people ","title":"Mary Ann Vaughn"},{"id":"4519286","text":"Part of an illustration from Gilpin's treatise The Cosmopolitan Railway was a proposed global railroad network advocated by William Gilpin, formerly the first territorial governor of Colorado (1861‚Äì62), in his 1890 treatise Cosmopolitan Railway: Compacting and Fusing Together All the World's Continents.

She was the wife of Abraham Serfaty, a Moroccan dissident. In 1974 Abraham Serfaty was sentenced to life imprisonment.Christine Daure- Serfaty It was in September 1999 that the new Moroccan king, Mohammed VI permitted Abraham Serfaty‚Äôs return to Morocco.Letter from Morocco Biography Christine Daure arrived in Morocco in 1962. In 1972, in Casablanca, she hid two political dissidents wanted by the Moroccan police: Abraham Serfaty who ended up sentenced to life in prison in 1974, and Abdellatif Zeroual, who died under torture after his arrest. During these years, she fought to save Abraham Serfaty from the same fate. She finally obtained the right to marry him in jail in 1986 and settled in Rabat. She was the first person to denounce the existence of the secret prison of death Tazmamart, which was denied for years by the Moroccan authorities. The following year, the book \\"Notre ami le roi\\"(\\"Our friend, the King\\") by Gilles Perrault, a book she helped to write though her name didn't appear, mentioned the prison at a political level, radically changing the image of Hassan II's regime in the western world and contributing to its evolution in the following years. As a result, many prisoners were, one after the other, saved from certain death. Her husband Abraham Serfaty was released from jail in 1991, after seventeen years of imprisonment, torture and isolation, and was immediately expelled (to France). Christine Daure-Serfaty was also expelled, without any explanation, after being arrested and detained at a police station for one night. It was only after eight years of exile and two months after Hassan II's death, in September 1999, that the couple was authorized by King Mohamed VI of Morocco to return to Morocco. She was previously married to the French politician Pierre Aguiton, with whom she had a son Christophe Aguiton, a left-wing trade-unionist born in 1953, and a daughter, Lise Aguiton-Moro. Christine Daure-Serfaty died on 28 May 2014 in a hospital in Paris.

Adventures of the Little Wooden Horse, written while expecting her first child, remained in print throughout her life from its publication in 1939. Her classic stories often involved brave creatures who overcome trials and cruelty in the outside world before finding a loving home. They included The Good Little Christmas Tree of 1943, and Gobbolino, the Witch's Cat first published the previous year. It immediately sold out but disappeared until re-issued in abridged form by Kaye Webb at Puffin Books twenty years later, when it became a best-seller. Life Williams was born in Petersfield, Hampshire, by ten minutes the younger of identical twins. She and her sister Barbara √Årnason were talented artists and for six years from the age of ten wrote and illustrated books for each other's birthdays and at Christmas. Both were enthusiastic Girl Guides, attending some of the movement's first camps, and some of Ursula's early books were collections of stories she had told to her own Brownie pack. The girls were also keen riders ‚Äì on hobby horses at first. To save for a pony they kept goats, selling their milk which they refused to drink themselves. Thanks to their uncle, the publisher Stanley Unwin, the twins visited the Alps, which later inspired some of Ursula's most vivid writing, most notably the trilogy that began with The Three Toymakers. Its final volume, The Toymaker's Daughter, was among her finest and most moving creations. Williams' greatest source of ideas, however, was the extraordinary house in which she spent her teenage years, North Stoneham House, a large, dilapidated mansion set in woodland north of Southampton. Events from her remarkable childhood recur repeatedly in her fiction, with North Stoneham described at greatest length in the 1941 A Castle for John-Peter and depicted in Faith Jaques‚Äô illustrations for Grandpapa's Folly and the Woodworm-Bookworm of 1974. In many regards, her life was as remarkable and inspirational as that of her fictional heroes. She was a friend of Puffin Books editor Kaye Webb, and organised riotous parties for the Puffin Club, of which she was made the first honorary member. She worked with illustrators like Shirley Hughes, Faith Jaques and Edward Ardizzone. Much of her later writing included disruptive, but essentially good-hearted children, and was influenced by her work as a juvenile magistrate and as a highly involved school governor. Locally she was greatly admired for her many acts of kindness and an instinctive Christian faith. Personal problems including her brother's threatened suicide, family crises, the death of her husband, the loss of an eye, and her near death to cancer, interrupted her work, but the indomitable author went on writing until the age of 80, and achieved the longest published career of any children's writer of her generation. She married Conrad Southey \\"Peter\\" John in 1935. They lived at Hampton, near Kingston upon Thames, then Esher, before moving to Gloucestershire in 1942, and Beckford, Worcestershire, in 1945. Peter died in 1971. They had four sons, three of whom survived her. She died in 2006 at Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire.Davison (2011) Many of Williams' manuscripts and further correspondence are held at Seven Stories, the Centre for Children's Books in Newcastle.

Biography She was born in 1853 in Providence, Rhode Island. She grew up in Boston, taught at elementary school there and went on into journalism. She wrote for the Boston Home Journal, the Boston Journal and the Boston Herald. She started the short-lived The Mahogany Tree in 1892. In 1898, she moved to France, and, while there, became a friend of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. She worked as a foreign correspondent and translator. Aldrich moved to Huiry, near Paris, in 1914, only months before the outbreak of the First World War. Her house there overlooked the Marne river valley, and her experiences during the First Battle of the Marne, as detailed in her letters to friends in the U.S., constitute her first book, A Hilltop on the Marne (1915). Following the success of that work, Aldrich produced three more collections of her wartime letters. On the Edge of the War Zone (1917) contains letters dating from the aftermath of the Marne battle until the entry of the U.S. into the war, The Peak of the Load (1918) details most of the final year of the war, and When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1919) describes her experiences in the months immediately following the war's end. Aldrich also produced one novel, Told in a French Garden, August 1914 (1916), and in 1926 completed an autobiography entitled Confessions of a Breadwinner, which resides in the collections of the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University, but has never been published (although digital images of the typed manuscripts are displayed on the Harvard University website). Aldrich received the French Legion of Honor 1922 for her war work and her influence on behalf of the US entry into the war.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, eds (London, Batsford, 1990), p. 15. . In February 1928, she suffered a heart attack and died a few days later at the American Hospital in Neuilly. She is buried at the Church of St Denis in Quincy-Voisins.

The label was founded in 1990 by Zalman Fishman, owner of the nightclub FIFTH COLVMN, located in Washington D.C.Ordering Info The label's first release was Chemlab's debut EP Ten Ton Pressure. Jared Hendrickson of Chemlab also became the general manager for the label. Chemlab later played several dates with Nine Inch Nails, eventually attracting a distribution deal for their next release, Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar, with Metal Blade Records. The band Thud was the next artist to join the label. Heavy, loud and unrelenting, Thud became very popular amongst Metal fans and critics alike luring Eli Janney from Girls Against Boys to contribute to their debut record Life & Death and earning co-headling performances with Stone Temple Pilots. After the re- release of Ten Ton Pressure with some new songs and remixes the label's release strategy turned more aggressive and sharply focused on growth. In 1994 the label signed a distribution deal with Caroline Records, which covered all releases except Chemlab, who were still governed by their deal with Metal Blade Records. Three new developing artists saw their debut albums released by Fifth Colvmn forming a solid foundation upon which the label could be built. These artists were Haloblack, Acumen (now Acumen Nation) and electronic/ambient project Perceptual Outer Dimensions. The following year brought explosive growth as the label established itself as the U.S. home for two cutting edge European Industrial Rock labels; Hard Records and Cyber-tec Records. Cyber-tec Records was exclusive to FCR. Hard Records' agreement with FCR saw the release of two Luc van Acker solo albums as well as the Max M Corporation. Cyber-tec Records' exciting brand of EBM/Industrial Rock was exposed to American audiences through the release of the bands New Mind and a unique side-project of Jean-Luc DeMeyer of Front 242 entitled the Cyber-tec Project. Other projects of note that saw the light of day included a trippy, dream-pop album from Die Warzau members Jim Marcus and Van Christie with Jane Jensen on vocals, a project from Black Rain that also served as the score to the European version of the film Johnny Mnemonic based on the William Gibson short story of the same name and a spooky voudou/goth-rock project led by Rodney Orpheus of goth-rock pioneer Cassandra Complex. Through its network of musicians and studio techs throughout Chicago, FCR connected with John Elliott of the band Dessau. Originally signed to Carlyle Records, an early industrial- dance label, Dessau's latest demo included guest spots from Paul Barker of Ministry and Richard Patrick formerly of Nine Inch Nails. Along with the Cyber-tec Project, Dessau's \\"Details Sketchy\\" release would help buoy the label to a very solid first full year. 1996, saw the label release some very strong follow-up records including the long awaited \\"East Side Militia\\", Chemlab's follow-up to their debut full-length \\"Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar\\" originally released in 1993. In addition to Chemlab, Acumen released \\"Territory = Universe\\" a follow-up to \\"Transmissions from Eville\\" and Haloblack released \\"funkyhell\\" following their debut entitled \\"Tension Filter\\". There were new artists joining the fold in this year as well. Death Ride 69, a project involving members of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, Trust Obey a creation from John Bergin, a co-creator of The Crow comic book and James Ray, a contemporary of Andrew Eldritch's from the Sisters of Mercy who re-issued a selection of his collaborations with Eldritch, all released debut records on FCR in 1996. Also new to the FCR fold was Final Cut. At one point Final Cut called Nettwerk Records home and regularly toured with My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. \\"Atonement\\" was released by Final Cut on FCR in the Fall of 1996 and helped build the label's credibility amongst musicians. While trying to build upon a shaky distribution deal, the label entered 1997 supporting Chemlab on tour with art-metal visionaries GWAR and a selection of artists including The Shining, artists from the Italian label sub/mission and an assortment of electronic, drum and bass and dance records on the Full- Contact Records imprint.

The basic plan for the record was to get the Eddies into a studio to record their own versions of some of the day's top CCM hits. The disc starts off with The Eddies version of the DeGarmo & Key song \\"God Good, Devil Bad,\\" which finds Camarillo singing as if he's just received a severe blow to the head. Towards the end of the song, Camarillo adds his own touches to the lyrics including the lines \\"Knife Sharp, Spoon Dull\\" and \\"Sun Hot, Snow Cold.\\" Next up on the chopping block is Amy Grant's early 1990s hit \\"Baby Baby.\\" The Eddies perform the song as if they are performing it during karaoke night at the local Ramada. Dc Talk's \\"I Luv Rap Music\\" sounds as though it is performed by a cheesy lounge act. In order to hit the girlishly high vocals of Stryper's \\"Sing A Long Song,\\" The Eddies actually slowed the tape down and recorded the song at that speed. Then, once the tape was sped back up to the regular speed, Camarillo ends up sounding like a long lost Sweet brother on steroids. The reaction to the album was mixed. Some fans loved it, others absolutely hated it and returned their CDs smashed into tiny pieces. Some tracks, like the Eddies cover of DC Talk's \\"I Luv Rap Music\\" found a considerable amount of radio play in various markets. Reactions from the songs' original artists were generally positive. Eddie DeGarmo commented about how he knew that D&K; should never have recorded \\"God Good, Devil Bad\\". Amy Grant later referenced the album jokingly in a video tribute to Terry Taylor which was played before a Lost Dogs concert in Chatsworth, California.

Biography He was born at Kristiansand in Vest-Agder, Norway. He attended the Technical School at Porsgrunn. He graduated from the Norwegian Naval Flight School (Marinens Flygeskole) at Horten in 1919. He was promoted to lieutenant in the Royal Norwegian Navy during 1922. Marinens Flygev√•pen 1912-1914 (in Norwegian) (Hafsten, Arheim) In 1923 with Roald Amundsen he tried to fly from Wainwright, Alaska to Spitsbergen across the North Pole. Amundsen and Omdal's aircraft was damaged and they abandoned the journey. In 1925, Omdal was a mechanic on Lincoln Ellsworth and Roald Amundsen's attempted flight to the North Pole. Roald Amundsens mislykkede polferd (Norgesglasset NRK)Roald Amundsen (Store norske leksikon) Disappearance Omdal took off on December 23, 1927 from Curtiss Field on Long Island, New York with Frances Wilson Grayson, navigator Brice Goldsborough and engineer Frank Koehler headed for Harbor Grace in Newfoundland. This flight was in preparation for Grayson's planned crossing of the Atlantic Ocean to set the record for the first woman to cross. The twin- engine air-craft Dawn, an amphibious Sikorsky S-36, and its crew never arrived. No trace of the plane or the four aviators was found.Oskar Omdal (Store norske leksikon) Legacy Oscar Omdal street in Stavanger and Oscar Omdal terrace in the Hamresanden district of Kristiansand are both named after him. In 1928, the Ontario Surveyor General named a number of lakes in the northwest of the province to honour aviators who had perished during 1927, mainly in attempting oceanic flights. p 14.

Its fossils have been found in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, northern Germany. Emausaurus is the only known Toarcian thyreorphoran and it is also the only dinosaur from the Ciechocinek Formation with a formal name.Haubold, H. (1991). Der Greifswalder Dinosaurier ‚Äò‚ÄòEmausaurus‚Äô‚Äô. Fundgrube, 27(2), 51-60. Discovery and naming The type and only species, E. ernsti, was named and described by Harmut Haubold in 1990.Haubold, H. 1990. Ein neuer Dinosaurier (Ornithischia, Thyreophora) aus dem Unteren Jura des n√∂rdlichen Mitteleuropa. Revue de Paleobiologie 9(1):149-177. [In German] The generic name is composed of an acronym of Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald and Greek sauros/œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ (lizard). The specific name is derived from the name of geologist Werner Ernst, who acquired the fossil, holotype SGWG 85, in the summer of 1963 from foreman Werner Wollin at a loampit near Grimmen, in strata dating from the Toarcian.Pereda-Suberbiola, X., D√≠az-Mart√≠nez, I., Salgado, L., & de Valais, S. (2015). S√≠ntesis del registro f√≥sil de dinosaurios tire√≥foros en Gondwana. Publicaci√≥n Electr√≥nica de la Asociaci√≥n Paleontol√≥gica Argentina, 15(1).Martill, D. M., Batten, D. J., & Loydell, D. K. (2000). A new specimen of the thyreophoran dinosaur cf. Scelidosaurus with soft tissue preservation. Palaeontology, 43(3), 549-559. It is known by the right side of the skull, the right lower jaw, caudal vertebrae, neural arches, a radius, a metatarsal, a claw, fragments of ribs, scutes and plates, known as EMAU SGWG 85. http://www.paleofile.com/Dinosaurs/Armor/Emausaurus.asp Description Restoration of Emausaurus being attacked by an unnamed theropod belonging to the Orionides Emausaurus was probably a semibipedal to quadrupedal animal, being covered on a armor of osteoderms across the body. Like other thyreorphora, probably was hervivore, concretely a low dwelling one, with a diet more related with ground flora, such as Cycads and Bennnetitales. The body length of the holotype of Emausaurus has been estimated at around 2.5 m, with a weight of 70-90 Kg. This was based on a juvenile individual though; adult length has been estimated at three to four metres, with a weight up to 240 Kg. Most of the reconstruction has been based on Scelidosaurus, although it is possible that Emausaurus was a more bipedal animal, as some of the young specimens of Scelidosaurus were thought to be. Adult forms probably where more quadrupedal.Probst, E. (2010). Dinosaurier in Deutschland: von Compsognathus bis zu Stenopelix. GRIN Verlag. Armor includes three conical scutes and one tall, spiny element. David Norman in 2019 examined the morphology of Scelidosaurus, comparing it with Emausaurus. In Emausaurus the maxilla has, overall, a similar morphology to that seen in Scelidosaurus. The disarticulated maxilla of Emausaurus exhibits an anteromedially directed robust process with which it met its counterpart in the midline, creating a wedge-like structure, with no obvious offset between the alveolar margins. In Emausaurus the structure of the frontals is not well preserved. In outline, its proportions resemble those of Scelidosaurus, but the same is true of many Ornithischia. The lacrimal bone of Emausaurus is incomplete, but includes a long, curved jugal process that evidently wrapped itself around the anterior tip of the jugal.Norman, D. B. (2019). Scelidosaurus harrisonii from the Early Jurassic of Dorset, England: cranial anatomy. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. doi:10.1093/zoolinnean/zlz074 So little is known of the postcranium Emausaurus, recovering parts like a multipartite odontoid (sutured to the axis centrum), similar to that of Scelidosaurus.Norman, D. B. (2019). Scelidosaurus harrisonii from the Early Jurassic of Dorset, England: postcranial skeleton. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. doi:10.1093/zoolinnean/zlz078 Emausaurus has a series of assigned Osteoderms, but lacks like Scutellosaurus ‚Äòscapular osteoderms‚Äô. The major series of osteoderms foun appear to come from the tail or the dorsal section.Norman, D. B. (2020). Scelidosaurus harrisonii from the Early Jurassic of Dorset, England: the dermal skeleton. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. doi:10.1093/zoolinnean/zlz085 Classification Cladistic analyses showed that Emausaurus was a basal member of the Thyreophora, more derived than Scutellosaurus, but less than Scelidosaurus.Sereno, P. C. (1997). The origin and evolution of dinosaurs. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 25(1), 435-489. Scelidosaurus, Emausaurus and Scutellosaurus cluster at the base of most trees because they can be scored for only a restricted number of anatomical characters.Sereno PC. 1999. The evolution of dinosaurs. Science 284: 2137‚Äì2147Butler RJ, Upchurch P, Norman DB. 2008. The phylogeny of the ornithischian dinosaurs. Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 6: 1‚Äì40. The cladistic status of the specimen is relatively controversial due to its young nature. Clearly it is a member of the Thyreophora, but its position can change by the time, if an adult specimen is found.Porro, L. B., Witmer, L. M., & Barrett, P. M. (2015). Digital preparation and osteology of the skull of Lesothosaurus diagnosticus (Ornithischia: Dinosauria). PeerJ, 3, e1494. Emausaurus can be more derived than Scelidosaurus, or even be a sister taxa to Stegosauria.Stumpf, S., & Meng, S. (2013). Dinosaurier aus Nordostdeutschland: Verschleppt. Biologie in unserer Zeit, 43(6), 362-368. The major consensu has put Emausaurusnon- eurypodan stem thyreophoran, along with Scutellosaurus and Scelidosaurus reinforced by almost all subsequent systematic reviews of ornithischian‚Äìthyreophoran relationships.Coombs WP, Marya≈Ñska T. 1990.

Vickaryous et al. (2004), did the default phylogenetic analysis for ingroup ankylosaurs, due to including cranial and postcranial characters, a wide range of taxa and made no ingroup relationships, altrougth this analysis used the holotype Lesothosaurus and Huayangosaurus as outgroups, ignoring Scelidosaurus and Emausaurus.Vickaryous MK, Marya≈Ñska T, Weishampel DB. 2004. Ankylosauria. In: Weishampel DB, Dodson P, Osm√≥lska H, eds. The Dinosauria, 2nd edn. Berkeley: University of California Press, 363‚Äì392. On 2020, Norman et al. by studing Scelidosaurus found that along Scutellosaurus and Emausaurus both are positioned on the stem of Ankylosauria, rather than on the stem of Thyreophora, with Emausaurus as the basal sister-taxon to Scelidosaurus.Norman, D. B. (2020). Scelidosaurus harrisonii (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) from the Early Jurassic of Dorset, England: biology and phylogenetic relationships. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. doi:10.1093/zoolinnean/zlaa061 This is because Emausaurus posesses a dorsal margin of the dentary sinuous in lateral view and neither elongated nor squat proportions of metacarpal 1 ‚Äòmedium‚Äô. Alternatively, Emausaurus can be basal sister-taxon to Scutellosaurus, but taking the similarities between Emausaurus and Scelidosaurus is more unlikely. The Norman study is resumed on: Paleoecology Emausaurus has a sinuous jaw profile, more advanced in ankylosauromorphans, unlike the rectilinear morphology seen in the more basal genus Scutellosaurus.Norman, D. B. (2020). Scelidosaurus harrisonii (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) from the Early Jurassic of Dorset, England: biology and phylogenetic relationships. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. doi:10.1093/zoolinnean/zlaa061 The changes on the jaw is considered a series of modifications due to changes on the Diet and evolution of the food procesation of this dinosaurs, where it seems to be adapted to eat Coriaceous flora, such as Bennetites and Cycads, abundant on the Ciechocinek Formation Lublin Coal Basin.Szyde≈Ç, Z., & Szyde≈Ç, R. (1981). Profil utwor√≥w liasu na obszarze Lubelskiego Zag≈Çƒôbia Wƒôglowego. PrzeglƒÖd Geologiczny, 29(11), 568-571. The rest of the skeleton of this genus is poorly presented, with for example the vertebrae showing no evidence of the proportional changes in the height of the neural arches and spines seen on stegosaurs. The animal was covered on Osteoderms, altrougth the few found give no indication of how extensively they were distributed across the torso. Emausaurus, based on the proportions of the preserved metacarpals that the forelimb shows adaptations for weight support, rather than grasping, having ungulal phalanges that are conical and only slightly decurved. The partial known proximal pedal phalanges are short and block-like, with near the same proportions seen in the pes of Scelidosaurus. A series of characters that together are suggestive of graviportality and quadrupedality, maling Emausaurus a low roaming herbivore. Pseudo-Bipedality isn¬¥t discarded, with the genus able to reach sligthly taller flora. Paleoenvironment The holotype of Emausaurus was found on the so-called \\"Emausaurus type site\\", from the Ciechocinek Formation dating from the Lower Toarcian (Tenuicostatum).Ernst, W. E. R. N. E.

Is is a boundary composed by bituminous shale, that represents an ancient seashore environment, probably lagoonal, and it is contemporaneous of the Posidonia Shale of Southern Germany. Fossil wood has been found on the same location, including driftwood and other related to the Araucariaceae, present in other European environments of Toarcian age. Of the invertebrate fauna insects, bivalves, sea snails and ammonites (Genus Tiltoniceras, Eleganticeras and Lobolytoceras) have been found.

The term was coined by author Alissa Quart, who used the term in her review of the film Happy Endings (2005) for the film journal Film Comment in 2005. Film critic Roger Ebert popularized the term when reviewing the film Syriana in 2005. These films are not hypermedia and do not have actual hyperlinks, but are multilinear in a more metaphorical sense. In describing Happy Endings, Quart considers captions acting as footnotes and split screen as elements of hyperlink cinema and notes the influence of the World Wide Web and multitasking. Playing with time and characters' personal history, plot twists, interwoven storylines between multiple characters, jumping between the beginning and end (flashback and flashforward) are also elements. Ebert further described hyperlink cinema as films where the characters or action reside in separate stories, but a connection or influence between those disparate stories is slowly revealed to the audience; illustrated in Mexican director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's films Amores perros (2000), 21 Grams (2003), and Babel (2006). Quart suggests that director Robert Altman created the structure for the genre and demonstrated its usefulness for combining interlocking stories in his films Nashville (1975) and Short Cuts (1993).Ebert, Roger (2006). Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2007. Andrews McMeel Publishing. p. 100. However, his work was predated by several films, including Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game (1939)Ten Classic Hyperlink Films - CinemaCatharsis, Satyajit Ray's Kanchenjunga (1962), Federico Fellini's Amarcord (1973), and Ritwik Ghatak's Titash Ekti Nadir Naam (1973), all of which use a narrative structure based on multiple characters. Quart also mentions the television series 24 and discusses Alan Rudolph's film Welcome to L.A. (1976) as an early prototype. Crash (2004) is an example of the genre,‚ÄúCrossing Over‚Äù and Hyperlink Cinema-IFC as are Steven Soderbergh's Traffic (2000), City of God (2002), Syriana (2005) and Nine Lives (2005). Some video games Octopath Traveler (2018) has been called hyperlink cinema. Analysis The hyperlink cinema narrative and story structure can be compared to social science's spatial analysis. As described by Edward Soja and Costis Hadjimichalis spatial analysis examines the \\"'horizontal experience' of human life, the spatial dimension of individual behavior and social relations, as opposed to the 'vertical experience' of history, tradition, and biography.\\" English critic John Berger notes for the novel that \\"it is scarcely any longer possible to tell a straight story sequentially unfolding in time\\" for \\"we are too aware of what is continually traversing the story line laterally.\\" An academic analysis of hyperlink cinema appeared in the journal Critical Studies in Media Communication, and referred to the films as Global Network Films. Narine's study examines the films Traffic (2000), Amores perros (2000), 21 Grams (2003), Beyond Borders (2003), Crash (2004; released 2005), Syriana (2005), Babel (2006) and others, citing network theorist Manuel Castells and philosophers Michel Foucault and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. The study suggests that the films are network narratives that map the network society and the new connections citizens experience in the age of globalization.

The character was created by Kevin Williamson and is portrayed by Canadian actress Neve Campbell. She first appeared in Scream (1996) followed by four sequels: Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000), Scream 4 (2011) and Scream (2022).Reel Views 2: The Ultimate Guide to the Best 1,000 Modern Movies on DVD and Video by James Berardinelli, Roger Ebert; Published by Justin, Charles & Co., 2005; , . The character appears in the Scream films as the target of a series of killers who adopt the Ghostface persona, a ghost mask and black cloak, to pursue her. In each film, the Ghostface killers often murder people close to Sidney and taunt her by phone with threats and intimate knowledge of her life or the murder of her mother, leading to a final confrontation where the true killer is revealed.The Movies That Make You Scream! by R. David Fulcher; Published by AuthorHouse, 2007; , 9781425994273. The killers that target Sidney have varying motivations ranging from revenge in Scream to the fame that will come from killing her in Scream 2, due to the fame she herself has obtained as a survivor of the murder spree in the original film. She first becomes the focus of her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and his friend Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard), Billy seeking revenge for his mother's abandonment following his father's affair with Sidney's mother Maureen Prescott. Scream 3 later reveals that Billy learned of this affair through Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), Sidney's half-brother, himself seeking revenge for his abandonment and rejection by Maureen, sparking the chain of events that permeate each film. Drew Barrymore was originally cast as Sidney Prescott but scheduling conflicts led to her taking a smaller role, with the lead being offered instead to Campbell, who at the time was starring in the TV show Party of Five. She was hesitant to take another horror role after finishing work on The Craft (1996) but took the opportunity as it would be her first leading role in a feature film. Campbell reprised the role in Scream 2 and Scream 3 though her own scheduling conflicts meant she could only film for a short period of time while the third film was in production. This resulted in her character's role being reduced significantly from prior installments and focus was shifted onto the series' other lead characters, Gale Weathers and Dewey Riley. Campbell initially refused requests to return for Scream 4, with scripts written with her character's absence in mind, but ultimately agreed to return. The character is depicted as an intelligent, resourceful young woman who slowly becomes stronger over the course of the series as she attempts to overcome the threats and deaths around her.Wes Craven: The Art of Horror by John Kenneth Muir; Published by McFarland, 2004, , . Neve Campbell's role as Sidney Prescott has received significant critical praise throughout the series, earning her the title of Scream Queen in the 1990s and won her the Saturn Award for Best Actress in 1997 for Scream and the MTV Award for Best Female Performance in 1998 for her role in Scream 2. Appearances Sidney Prescott first appeared in the 1996 film Scream as a teenager attending the fictional Woodsboro High School. After a series of brutal murders occur on the anniversary of her mother's death, the killer begins targeting Sidney herself with attacks and taunting phone calls. Her character has appeared in each successive film in the series, her role initially that of the victim but growing into heroine where she personally confronts each killer and defeats them. Films Sidney Prescott's first cinematic appearance was in the film Scream as a 17-year-old high school senior in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California. During a spree of grisly murders, she begins to receive taunting and threatening phone calls from Ghostface, who claims to have knowledge of the brutal rape and murder of Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother, which occurred one year prior to the events of the film, a murder that is blamed on Cotton Weary. Suspicion falls on several characters before both her boyfriend Billy Loomis and his friend Stu Macher are revealed to both be the killer. Billy states his motivation as revenge following his mother abandoning him over his father's affair with Maureen. With help from Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), Sidney is able to kill Stu and Billy and survive the events of the film. Sidney's second appearance was in Scream 2 which takes place two years later as student at the fictional Windsor College where a new series of Ghostface murders occur. The killers again taunt Sidney and murder her friends including Randy Meeks before her friend Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) reveals himself as the killer and murders her new boyfriend, Derek, in front of her. Mickey states his motivation as the fame that will come from his exploits including the murder of Sidney and reveals his accomplice, Mrs. Loomis (Laurie Metcalf), seeking revenge against Sidney for the death of her son Billy. Mrs. Loomis betrays and kills Mickey, intending to disappear without trace after killing Sidney, but before she can enact her plan, Cotton intervenes and shoots her, saving Sidney, who then shoots Mrs. Loomis in the head, killing her. The third appearance of Sidney occurred in Scream 3 three years later where another murder spree begins in Hollywood, with the killer leaving photos of a young Maureen Prescott at the crime scenes. Sidney, now a crisis counselor for women, has been in hiding following the events of Scream and Scream 2 but is drawn to the set of \\"Stab 3\\", the film within a film based on Sidney and her experiences, after the new Ghostface discovers her location. Ghostface claims responsibility for the murder of Maureen Prescott and is unmasked as the director of \\"Stab 3\\", Roman Bridger, Sidney's previously unknown half-brother. Roman reveals that their mother was gang raped and impregnated with him during a two-year period where she moved to Hollywood to become an actress, before she met Sidney's father. After being given up for adoption, an adult Roman sought her out only for her to reject him. Roman began stalking Maureen, filming her adulterous liaisons with other men, including the father of Billy Loomis, and used this footage to convince Billy to murder Maureen, unknowingly setting in motion the events of Scream and Scream 2. Sidney manages to defeat Roman, with Dewey Riley's (David Arquette) help and finally move on with her life. Sidney's fourth appearance was in Scream 4 set ten years after the events of Scream 3. After returning to the town of Woodsboro to publicize her new book, \\"Out of Darkness\\" - a self-help book about overcoming the events of her life - a new Ghostface begins attacking the town and leaves evidence in Sidney's car. Becoming a suspect in the murders, Sidney stays in town with her cousin Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts) and aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell) but the family becomes embroiled in the Ghostface murder spree. Sidney tries to save Jill from being attacked only to discover that Jill is the killer with her accomplice Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin), Jill hoping to recreate the events of Billy and Stu's murder spree to make herself the Sidney of a \\"new generation\\" with all the associated fame. Jill betrays and kills Charlie, and stabs Sidney, before brutalizing herself to appear the \\"sole survivor\\", but after arriving at hospital she discovers Sidney has survived. When Jill attempts to finally kill her cousin, Sidney manages to shoot Jill in the heart, killing her. Casting The role of Sidney Prescott was initially given to actress Drew Barrymore after Barrymore herself approached the production, having read the script, to request the role and was signed to the film before a director had even been found. Wes Craven, after being hired as director, commented that he was able to have bigger actors in the film than his budget allowed because of Barrymore's desire to be involved, which he believed helped attract other big names to the production. While early development on the film took place, however, Barrymore's schedule commitments meant she was no longer able to remain in the demanding leading role, but still wishing to take part she volunteered to play the smaller role of Casey Becker, who dies early in the film, with her scene being filmed in five days. Following Barrymore's abdication of the role, actresses Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the part. The production also offered the role to Reese Witherspoon although she ultimately never auditioned. It was Canadian actress Neve Campbell who was given the lead of Sidney Prescott after Craven saw her in the television series Party of Five, believing she could best embody a character who was \\"innocent\\" but also able to handle herself while dealing with the demanding physicality and emotions of the role. Campbell herself was reluctant to undertake a role in another horror film so soon after taking part in The Craft (1996), but agreed to Scream as it would be her first leading role and she \\"adored\\" the character saying \\"She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie.\\" Campbell and her on-screen boyfriend Skeet Ulrich had previously starred together in The Craft which they believed helped make their performance of the relationship between Sidney and Ulrich's character, Billy Loomis, more natural. On how she approached the leading role in the series, Campbell stated: Kevin Williamson had submitted treatments for two possible sequels to Scream before the film was even released and so Campbell had been contracted for Scream 2 when she signed on to the original film as she played the only character guaranteed to survive the film. However, scheduling became an issue for Campbell and the production as, at the time, she was still starring in Party of Five. For Scream 3, Craven insisted that convincing Campbell and the other principal cast to return was not a problem, but scheduling Campbell's availability with the film's production again became an issue, with Campbell starring not only in Party of Five but three other feature films. Her availability was limited enough that she was only available for 20 days of filming which resulted in a significantly reduced role for her character and a shift in focus to Cox and Arquette's characters of Gale Weathers and Dewey Riley respectively. When production of Scream 4 was announced, nearly ten years after the last installment of the series, Campbell initially refused offers to reprise her role as Sidney, forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her absence while again shifting focus on to Cox and Arquette's roles. However, by September 2009, Campbell was confirmed as reprising her role in the film. Early versions of Williamson's Scream 4 script involved Campbell's character being attacked in the opening, a key point of contention for Bob Weinstein, head of Scream developer Dimension Films, who had it removed. Reception On her character of Sidney Prescott, Neve Campbell spoke positively, saying she \\"adored\\" the character and \\"She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie.\\" In 1997, the Scream role won Campbell the Saturn Award for Best Actress and an MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance nomination. The following year, she went on to win the 1998 Best Female Performance for Scream 2 and received a second Best Actress nomination from the Saturn Awards, losing to Jodie Foster for Contact (1997). She received a third and final Best Female Performance nomination from MTV in 2000 for the character in Scream 3 but lost to fellow Scream alum Sarah Michelle Gellar for Cruel Intentions (1999). John Muir, author of Wes Craven: The Art of Horror, praised the development of Sidney Prescott in Scream 2 labeling her character, amongst others, \\"beloved\\". Roger Ebert, heavily critical of the cast and film of Scream 3, singled out Campbell's role for praise saying \\"The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute\\". Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News was considerably less complimentary of Campbell, saying \\"She adds ZERO coolness. Zero talent. And Zero charisma to [Scream 3].\\" Bryan Enk and Adam Swiderski of UGO ranked Neve Campbell as the 8th greatest Scream Queen for her role as Sidney Prescott, saying \\"in the 1990s, Neve was pretty much the number-one scream queen around.\\" See also *Laurie Strode *Nancy Thompson *Final girl References Category:Scream (franchise) characters Category:Scream (film series) Category:Wes Craven characters Category:Film characters introduced in 1996 Category:Fictional characters from California Category:Fictional writers Category:Final girls Category:Teenage characters in film Category:Fictional college students Category:Fictional characters with post-traumatic stress disorder Category:Fictional fratricides ","title":"Sidney Prescott"},{"id":"4519547","text":"Tatisaurus is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur from the Early Jurassic from the Lower Lufeng Formation in Yunnan Province in China. Little is known as the remains are fragmentary. The type species is T. oehleri. Discovery and species In 1948 and 1949 Father Edgar Oehler, a Catholic priest working for the Fu Jen Catholic University at Beijing, excavated fossils near the village of Da Di in Yunnan. Among them was the jaw bone of a herbivorous dinosaur. In 1965 David Jay Simmons named and described it as the type species Tatisaurus oehleri. The generic name is derived from Da Di, then more usually spelled as \\"Ta Ti\\". The specific name honours Oehler.Simmons D.J. (1965), The non- therapsid reptiles of the Lufeng Basin, Yunnan, China. Field Geol 15; 1-93. The holotype, FMNH CUP 2088, was found in the Zhangjiawa Beds of the Lufeng Formation, dating from the Sinemurian. It consists of a partial left mandible with teeth. The lower jaw bone fragment is, lacking the tip, six centimetres long. The teeth are eroded. It is the only specimen known of the species. Simmons assigned Tatisaurus to the Hypsilophodontidae, though this group was seen by him as an evolutionary grade of \\"primitive\\" Ornithopoda, ancestral to several ornithischian groups. He felt that Tatisaurus' affinities were with Scelidosaurus or the Ankylosauria. Later, in 1990, the specimen was reviewed by Dong Zhiming, who noted it had similarities with Huayangosaurus. He placed the two genera in the same subfamily, the Huayangosaurinae, within the Stegosauria.Z. Dong. (1990). \\"Stegosaurs of Asia\\". In: K. Carpenter and P. J. Currie (eds.), Dinosaur Systematics: Perspectives and Approaches, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp. 255-268 Later still, in 1996, Spencer Lucas reclassified Tatisaurus oehleri as a species of Scelidosaurus, S. oehleri, in order to use Scelidosaurus for a biochron.Lucas S.G.

They instead found Tatisaurus to be a dubious basal thyreophoran, showing a single thyreophorean synapomorphy; a ventrally deflected mesial end of the dentary. If considered a thyreophoran, it would be one of the oldest known members of the group.

Life Affleck was born on 19 April 1725 the ninth son of the politician Gilbert Affleck (1684?‚Äì1764) of Dalham Hall. Affleck entered the navy at an early age, and during reign of George II, served in the several capacities of lieutenant, master and commander, and post captain. In 1778 was given command of the 74 gun and he briefly joined Vice- Admiral John Byron in North America before having to return for repairs. Affleck was with Sir Charles Hardy the following year before he was sent to relieve Gibraltar under the command of Sir George Rodney. Affleck's ship was noted for its ability to take the lead when attacking the Juan de L√°ngara's Spanish squadron during the Battle of St Vincent in 1780.J. K. Laughton, ‚ÄòAffleck, Sir Edmund, baronet (1725‚Äì1788)‚Äô, rev. Roger Morriss, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 June 2013 In 1781 he became a commodore and was briefly employed in New York, then being threatened by American rebels under George Washington. Surviving correspondence indicates Sir Edmund and General Washington to have been in contact regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. It was not, however, until the year 1782 had become ‚Äî as it might be historically stated ‚Äî a memorable epoch in the maritime annals of England, and that valour, ability, and boldness in battle, had retrieved for the nation its naval name, that opportunity had been afforded to Affleck to acquire celebrity and establish his professional fame. About this period, his broad pennant (the commodore's symbol of office) was flying on board , attached to the fleet then employed in the West Indies, under the orders of Sir Samuel Hood. In the cautious and somewhat speculative encounter which took place in Basse-terre Roads, between Hood and the celebrated Count de Grasse, it fell to the lot, or ‚Äî as he would have said himself ‚Äî good fortune of Affleck, who each day commanded the rear division of the British line, to sustain the brunt of the enemy's attack. His conduct on this occasion drew from the commander-in-chief, a public expression of praise. :\\"The enemy,\\" says Sir Samuel, in his official dispatches, \\"gave the preference to Commodore Affleck, but he kept up so noble a fire, and was so well supported by his seconds, Captain Cornwallis and Lord Robert Manners, that the loss and damage sustained in those ships were very trifling, and they very much preserved the other ships in the rear.\\" In furthering the fond aspirations of Affleck, time was any thing but tardy. On the 9 and 12 April ensuing, opportunity was again afforded him to increase his laurels. In the well-known conflicts that took place on those different days between Rodney and the Count de Grasse, and particularly in the memorable battle of the 12th, the commodore, in bringing up the rear of the centre division of the British fleet, manifested the noblest bearing. Fingringhoe Hall For the services rendered to his country in this glorious achievement, his sovereign conferred on him in 1782 the dignity of baronet of Britain; and out of compliment to his gallantry and general conduct, the electors of Colchester returned him the same year to represent that borough in parliament, which he did until his death. In turn, he attained his flag rank (in 1784), but in the capacity of admiral was never employed afloat. In 1784 he bought Fingringhoe Hall in Essex. He died at his London house on 19 November 1788. He had married twice; firstly widow Hester Creffeild (n√©e Hester Ruth) and secondly widow Margaret Smythies. He had only a daughter Charlotte and thus Fingringhoe Hall passed to the 2nd Baronet, Gilbert. See also *Philip Affleck, his brother, the admiral. *HMS Affleck, named after Sir Edmund Affleck.

The documents date from the 1980s through the post- Saddam period. In March 2006, the U.S. government, at the urging of members of Congress, made them available online at its Foreign Military Studies Office website, requesting Arabic translators around the world to help in the translation. In early November 2006, the entire set of documents was removed. Media reports stated that the website was taken offline because of security concerns regarding the posting of sophisticated diagrams and other information regarding nuclear weapon design prior to the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Origins The Ba'athists were said to be \\"meticulous record-keepers.\\" The documents were found in government offices in Iraq and Afghanistan. A debate ensued inside the government regarding whether these documents should be released to the public. Because the documents were not being made public through the normal channels, certain documents began to leak out through unconventional channels. The first set of documents was released to an online media outlet called Cybercast News Service. A second set of documents was released to The Intelligence Summit, an international intelligence conference that resulted in an ABC story on some of the audiotapes of Saddam Hussein talking to his top officials. A spokeswoman for John Negroponte, the Director of National Intelligence, noted that \\"Intelligence community analysts from the CIA and the DIA reviewed the translations and found that while fascinating from a historical perspective, the tapes do not reveal anything that changes their postwar analysis of Iraq's weapons programs, nor do they change the findings contained in the comprehensive Iraq Survey Group report.\\" Congressman Pete Hoekstra, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, described the rationale for the public disclosure of the documents as follows: :\\"We're hoping to unleash the power of the Internet, unleash the power of the blogosphere, to get through these documents and give us a better understanding of what was going on in Iraq before the war\\". Negroponte at first tried to delay the release of the documents, but softened his opposition to releasing after conversations with Hoekstra. President Bush directed Negroponte to release the documents and they were slowly being made available until they were taken offline in November 2006 due to security concerns (see below). The website issued a warning that: :the US Government has made no determination regarding the authenticity of the documents, validity or factual accuracy of the information contained therein, or the quality of any translations, when available. While the government has made an effort to keep known forgeries out of the set of documents posted to the web, a senior intelligence official observed that \\"the database included 'a fair amount of forgeries,' sold by Iraqi hustlers or concocted by Iraqis opposed to Mr. Hussein.\\" A congressional inquiry covered many of the accuracy concerns on April 6, 2006 and while the multiple reviews aimed at keeping forgeries out do not rise to the level of a guarantee of authenticity, a good faith effort has apparently been made to clean out forgeries. According to Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, the release of the documents \\"looks like an effort to discover a retrospective justification for the war in Iraq.\\"Internet Archived page of the Los Angeles Times report from March 17, 2006 The Pentagon cautioned that the government \\"has made no determination regarding the authenticity of the documents, validity or factual accuracy of the information contained therein, or the quality of any translations, when available.\\" The Los Angeles Times notes that \\"the documents do not appear to offer any new evidence of illicit activity by Hussein, or hint at preparations for the insurgency that followed the invasion.\\" The Republican-controlled Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded in a report released in September 2006 that \\"The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which is leading the exploitation effort of documents (DocEx) uncovered in Iraq, told Committee staff that 120 million plus pages of documents that were recovered in Iraq have received an initial review for intelligence information. [...] DIA officials explicitly stated that they did not believe that the initial review process missed any documents of major significance regarding Iraq's links to terrorism. During an interview with Committee staff, the lead DIA analyst who follows the issue of possible connections between the Iraqi government and al- Qa'ida noted that the DIA 'continues to maintain that there was no partnership between the two organizations'\\". Analysis of the approach Releasing the documents over the Internet to gain the help of translators around the world was an idea pushed by Congressman Pete Hoekstra. The Associated Press quoted Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists government secrecy project saying it's a \\"radical notion\\" that \\"members of the public could contribute to the intelligence analysis process. ... That is a bold innovation.\\" The AP also quoted Glenn Reynolds, the blogger at Instapundit.com: \\"The secret of the 21st century is attract a lot of smart people to focus on problems that you think are important.\\" After the documents were taken offline, however, Representative Hoekstra blamed the administration for following this advice: \\"Well, you know, we have a process in place. It looks like they screwed up.\\"\\"GOP rep. Faults White House on Iraq Site\\", Associated Press (November 5, 2006). John Prados, author of the book Hoodwinked: The Documents That Reveal How Bush Sold Us a War, said \\"I would bet that the materials that they chose to post were the ones that were suggestive of a threat.\\" Prados, an analyst with the National Security Archive, a non-governmental research institute, said the documents would have little WMD-related use: \\"The collection is good material for somebody who wants to do a biography of Saddam Hussein, but in terms of saying one thing or the other about weapons of mass destruction, it's not there.\\" Former CIA and State Department counterterrorism expert Larry C. Johnson said, \\"It's like putting firearms in the hands of children. The problem is that the documents without context aren't going to tell you a lot.\\" Johnson also noted that \\"it's also an indictment of the intelligence community. They don't have the resources ... they haven't got the time to go through this stuff.\\" Other experts have suggested that the problem is that bloggers will cherry-pick information from the documents to solidify their own perspectives without putting the tidbits they find in an overall historical context. Former CIA terrorism specialist Michael Scheuer pointed this out in an interview with the New York Times: \\"There's no quality control.

Rush Limbaugh will cherry-pick from the right, and Al Franken will cherry-pick from the left.\\" According to history professor Fritz Umbach, the document archive has been seeded \\"with suggestive jihadist materials\\" unrelated to the war in Iraq, and cites specific examples. In a Salon.com article, Umbach claims to have identified \\"approximately 40 files that are either completely unrelated to Iraq, or that are related only through jihadist elements of the insurgency that began after Saddam's fall.\\" He also notes that the archive website was linked \\"to an entirely unrelated database of al-Qaida materials\\", the Harmony database, creating confusion over documents suggestive of a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda. Umbach writes, \\"Whether intentional or not, the conflation and confusion of materials has been more than sufficient to convince bloggers on the political right that there were, as Bush officials insisted, operational links between Saddam's Iraq and al-Qaida.\\" Iraqi Perspectives Project After the fall of Baghdad, the United States Joint Forces Command commissioned a study of the inner workings and behavior of Saddam's regime, referred to as the Iraqi Perspectives Project. The study authors drew on many of the Iraqi Freedom documents, together with interviews with dozens of captured senior Iraqi military and political leaders, and summarized the study's key findings in a Foreign Affairs article, and have also made their full reportBroken link: available. The study's findings represent the analysis of many of the Iraqi Freedom documents and related interviews. In particular, the project concluded that: # Saddam's secretive and authoritarian government, together with his paranoia, rendered the Iraqi army grossly unprepared for conflict with coalition forces; # Saddam grossly miscalculated the ability of his contacts with the Russian, French, Chinese and other governments to prevent military action against Iraq, and # although Iraq almost certainly did not possess weapons of mass destruction, Saddam's desire to preserve ambiguity on the issue, together with his government's secrecy and previous attempts to deceive UN inspectors made it difficult for Iraq to convince the world that it had disarmed. For more information, see Iraqi Perspectives Project. The study also cites documents demonstrating that key evidence presented by Colin Powell to the United Nations in February 2003 had been severely misinterpreted by the U.S. government. Audiotapes played by Powell during his presentation, cited by Powell as evidence of Iraqi attempts to circumvent U.N. regulations on WMD, were reexamined in light of the new documents. According to the authors of the study: :Ironically, it now appears that some of the actions resulting from Saddam's new policy of cooperation actually helped solidify the coalition's case for war. Over the years, Western intelligence services had obtained many internal Iraqi communications, among them a 1996 memorandum from the director of the Iraqi Intelligence Service directing all subordinates to \\"insure that there is no equipment, materials, research, studies, or books related to manufacturing of the prohibited weapons (chemical, biological, nuclear, and missiles) in your site.\\" And when UN inspectors went to these research and storage locations, they inevitably discovered lingering evidence of WMD- related programs. In 2002, therefore, when the United States intercepted a message between two Iraqi Republican Guard Corps commanders discussing the removal of the words \\"nerve agents\\" from \\"the wireless instructions,\\" or learned of instructions to \\"search the area surrounding the headquarters camp and [the unit] for any chemical agents, make sure the area is free of chemical containers, and write a report on it,\\" U.S. analysts viewed this information through the prism of a decade of prior deceit. They had no way of knowing that this time the information reflected the regime's attempt to ensure it was in compliance with UN resolutions. What was meant to prevent suspicion thus ended up heightening it. Website closure In November 2006, the documents were removed from the Internet by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The U.S. government had already received warnings about the site's content from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who was specifically concerned about sensitive documents about the pre-1991 Iraqi nuclear program, but the documents were not removed until the New York Times informed the government that it would be publishing an article about the sensitive material. The New York Times called the material a \\"nuclear primer\\" because it included about a dozen documents in Arabic that contained \\"charts, diagrams, equations and lengthy narratives about bomb building that nuclear experts who have viewed them say go beyond what is available elsewhere on the Internet and in other public forums. For instance, the papers give detailed information on how to build nuclear firing circuits and triggering explosives, as well as the radioactive cores of atom bombs.\\" The fear was that these documents would give Iraq's nuclear secrets to Iran and thus aid the Iranian WMD program. Some criticized the Times for publishing the article. But Joseph Cirincione, director for nonproliferation at the Center for American Progress, pointed out that the Times had not put the documents online: \\"The journalists are the heroes. They got the stuff pulled down. This is what we want our journalists to be doing, to exposing these kind of abuses of power. Its Chairman Hoekstra and Chairman Roberts who insisted, against all the evidence, against everything we know, against what David Kay has told us, what the Iraq survey group has told us, there was no nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in Iraq. They were desperate to try and prove that case, somehow justify this extremely costly and catastrophic war. It's their zealotry that's caused the harm, not investigative journalism.\\" About select documents Several news stories about some of the documents were published after their release. *Document BIAP 2003-000654 was translated by Joseph Shahda and generated an article in the Weekly Standard. The document is a memo from the commander of an Iraqi Air Force base requesting a list of \\"the names of those who desire to volunteer for Suicide Mission to liberate Palestine and to strike American Interests.\\" *Document IZSP-2003-00001122, signed by a Ba'ath Party official, indicates that the Iraqis were worried about the Americans smuggling in and planting weapons of mass destruction (specifically, mobile weapons labs) in order to justify the invasion. *Document ISGZ 2004-019920 is a letter from Iraqi Intelligence in 2002 warning agents to be on the lookout for Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The letter warns that Zarqawi and another individual are in Iraq and states that apprehending them is a \\"top priority\\". According to the Associated Press (16 March 2006), \\"Attached were three responses in which agents said there was no evidence al-Zarqawi or the other man were in Iraq.\\" ABC notes that \\"The document does not support allegations that Iraq was colluding with al Qaeda.\\" * A series of \\"Sheen 27\\" documents show Saddam's regime was very involved in training fighters in the use of \\"improvised explosive devices\\" or IEDs. In a news report by Laurie Mylroie, several documents are discussed that speak of \\"Arab Fedayeen\\" (i.e. non-Iraqis) and the use of \\"of the people\\" bombs. Mylroie asserts that one of the documents that was posted was then taken down. The authors of the Iraqi Perspectives Project discussed these documents both in the report and in a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives (6 April 2006), indicating that Saddam was training a secular pan-Arab army. They wrote in the Foreign Affairs article about the documents, \\"In the years preceding the coalition invasion, Iraq's leaders had become enamored of the belief that the spirit of the Fedayeen's 'Arab warriors' would allow them to overcome the Americans' advantages. In the end, however, the Fedayeen fighters proved totally unprepared for the kind of war they were asked to fight, and they died by the thousands.\\" In the House hearing on this matter, defense analyst Lieutenant Colonel Kevin M. Woods noted that Saddam began recruiting foreign fighters into this army in the mid-1990s, and he described them as part of an \\"Arab liberation movement\\" that had been \\"part of Baath political philosophy going back to the beginnings of Saddam's regime.\\" * Other documents concern election laws in France, including correspondence from Iraqi intelligence \\"ordering the translation of important parts of a 1997 report about campaign financing laws in France.\\" ABC claims that these documents suggest Saddam's \\"strong interest in the mechanics and legalities of financial contributions to French politicians.\\" * One Iraqi document purportedly details a meeting on February 19, 1995, in which a representative of Iraq met in Sudan with Osama Bin Laden, who suggested \\"carrying out joint operations against foreign forces\\" in Saudi Arabia. Eight months later, al-Qaeda operatives killed five U.S. military advisors in Saudi Arabia. There has been no evidence or suggestion of Iraqi complicity in that attack or linkage to the February meeting. ABC News, who reported on this document, further notes that \\"The document does not establish that the two parties did in fact enter into an operational relationship.\\" ABC also cautions that \\"this document is handwritten and has no official seal.\\" *Another document claims that Russia had a mole inside the U.S. military who gave the Russians information regarding U.S. troop movements, information that was then forwarded to the Iraqi military. The Russians deny the story and some of the information the Russians reportedly passed to the Iraqis was incorrect. According to ABC, \\"A Pentagon study released today concludes, however, that the information didn't do Saddam Hussein any good because he never acted it on though it proved to be accurate.\\" * Another document suggests that the Iraqi government planned to respond to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq with \\"camels of mass destruction\\"‚Äîcamels fitted with suicide bombs that would meet the invading army. In another document, Saddam's son Qusay orders captured Kuwaitis to be used as \\"human shields\\" against the invaders. * Document 2RAD-2004-601189-ELC,Broken link to document 2RAD-2004-601189-ELC is given the synopsis: \\"Abu-Zubaydah Statement on the Capability of al-Qaidah to Manufacture and Deliver Nuclear Weapons to the U.S.\\" Abu Zubaydah was captured in Pakistan in March 2002 and is believed to be the highest-ranking member of al-Qaeda to be held. There is no indication that this document links Abu Zubaydah to Iraq in any way. Professor Fritz Umbach notes, \\"the 'statement' itself is nothing more than an Arabic summary of a 2002 CBS News story on Zubaydah's claims. It has no identifiable link to Iraq, other than the odd fact that it appears on a U.S. government site billed as Operation Iraqi Freedom Documents.\\" * Many of the documents seem to make clear that Saddam's regime had given up on seeking a WMD capability by the mid-1990s. As AP reported, \\"Repeatedly in the transcripts, Saddam and his lieutenants remind each other that Iraq destroyed its chemical and biological weapons in the early 1990s, and shut down those programs and the nuclear-bomb program, which had never produced a weapon.\\" At one 1996 presidential meeting, top weapons program official Amer Mohammed Rashid, describes his conversation with UN weapons inspector Rolf Ekeus: \\"We don't have anything to hide, so we're giving you all the details.\\" At another meeting Saddam told his deputies, \\"We cooperated with the resolutions 100 percent and you all know that, and the 5 percent they claim we have not executed could take them 10 years to (verify). Don't think for a minute that we still have WMD. We have nothing.\\" References External links * Foreign Military Studies Office Joint Reserve Intelligence Center * U.S. House of Representatives.

Having been a founding member of Lega Nord, along with Umberto Bossi, Franco Castellazzi, Giorgio Conca, Gipo Farassino, Riccardo Fragassi, Marilena Marin, Bruno Ravera, Francesco Speroni and Carla Uccelli, in 1989, Rocchetta led Liga Veneta into Lega Nord, which became a federation from a confederation, in 1991. During the party's founding federal congress, he was elected federal president, a role he would keep until 1994.

Post-Lega Nord activity Having left the Italian Parliament following the 1996 general election, Rocchetta, while continuing to be an active spokesman for Venetian nationalism, focused on pacifism and antimilitarism. In particular, in 1999 he went to Belgrade for what he described as a \\"mission of peace\\", along with some left-wing pacifists, notably including Luca Casarini, Gianfranco Bettin and Vitaliano Della Sala. With his \\"Center for International Studies\\" dedicated to Paolo Sarpi, Rocchetta organised several initiatives with representatives of minorities, notably including those with Ibrahim Rugova in favour of a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Kosovo. In 1999 Rocchetta was instrumental in the awarding to Rugova of the honorary citizenship of Venice by then-mayor Massimo Cacciari. Between the 1990s and the 2000s Rocchetta was honorary consul of the Republic of Macedonia in Venice. In 2013 Rocchetta returned to active politics after virtually 20 years of absence from the political scene as a member of Plebiscite 2013, a cross-party committee which organised the 2014 referendum on Veneto's independence, which saw the participation of 63.2% of eligible voters and the support of 89.1% among them.

She reigned from 1688 to 1699, being the fourth and last ruling queen (sultanah) in succession. Background When the old sultana Inayat Zakiatuddin Syah died in October 1688, Sultana Zainatuddin Kamalat Syah succeeded to the throne. There is no contemporary evidence about her relationship to the previous queens. According to a manuscript preserved at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, she was the daughter of Syekh Muhammad Fadlil Syah Teungku di Kedirian, son of Abdullah Fadlil, son of Muhyuddin Fadlil, son of Sultan Sri Alam.Hasjmy (1977), pp. 35-36. Alternatively she is alleged to be a daughter of Raja Umar bin Sultan Muda Muhammad Muhidudin; see Herman RN, Empat Sultanah Aceh Berdaulat . This would need further verification. Not all the orang kayas (grandees of the kingdom) supported the choice. Some wanted a king rather than a female ruler. Four orang kayas marched against the capital with considerable forces; however, the opposition soon receded and the queen was acknowledged.Djajadiningrat (1911), p. 190-1. Reign After almost six decades of female rule there was increasing pressure for a male sultan. A Dutch visitor. Jacob de Roy, reported in 1696 that the sultana formally held unlimited powers and convened the assembly of grandees; however, she had to await the approval of the majority of the counselors.Khan (2009), p. 179. He also wrote that groups of people sometimes gathered in the capital Kutaraja and performed demonstrations in favour of a king. The syahbandar (harbour master) entertained plans to arrange a marriage between the queen and his son, a captain of the guard who stood in high regard with Zainatuddin Kamalat Syah. He asked Jacob de Roy to mediate in the affair since he realized that a marriage would evoke the envy of the orang kayas. Another Dutch writer, Francois Valentijn indicates that the marriage was eventually concluded. In 1699 a purported fatwa arrived from Mecca, issued by the qadi Malik al-Adil. Whether it was genuine or if the authority of Mecca was employed to make an impression is debatable. The fatwa deemed that the rule of a woman was contrary to the principles of Islam. Upon this the sultana was replaced by an Arab of sayyid descent, Badr ul-Alam Syarif Hasyim Jamaluddin.Djajadiningrat (1911), p. 191. It is sometimes speculated that he became her husband. Zainatuddin died one year later, in 1700.

Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in the area of redistricting and racial gerrymandering. The court ruled in a 5-4 decision that redistricting based on race must be held to a standard of strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause. On the other hand, bodies doing redistricting must be conscious of race to the extent that they must ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The redistricting that occurred after the 2000 census, as required to reflect the population‚Äôs changes, was the first nationwide redistricting to apply the results of Shaw v. Reno. Decision Factual background  North Carolina's congressional districts (1993‚Äì1998); the 12th district in pink. The case involved the redistricting of North Carolina after the 1990 census. North Carolina submitted to the Department of Justice a map with one majority-minority black district--that is, a district with a black majority. The Department of Justice believed that the state could have drawn another such majority-minority district in order to improve representation of black voters rather than including them all within one district. The state revised its map and submitted a new plan, this one with two majority-minority districts. The proposed 12th district was long, winding through the state to connect various areas having in common only a large black population. Litigation and Supreme Court opinion A federal District Court dismissed a lawsuit by some North Carolina voters on the grounds that they had no claim for relief under a standard set by a previous Supreme Court case, United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh v. Carey. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court, which reversed that of the District Court. She described the shape of the new district as \\"bizarre\\" and said such a district \\"bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid.\\" The Court found that if a redistricting map is \\"so bizarre on its face that it is 'unexplainable on grounds other than race',\\" that a claim for relief under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is available to plaintiffs. Such redistricting will be held unconstitutional if it is found to be intended to segregate voters by race and this segregation cannot be justified under a standard of strict scrutiny. Actions subject to this standard must satisfy three conditions: a compelling government interest, narrowly tailored to achieve that goal, and the least restrictive means for achieving that interest. Dissents The dissenters noted: :(1) That the case was brought by white voters challenging the district. Its boundaries had enabled the district's majority of black voters to elect the majority-white state's first black representatives to Congress since 1898, when George Henry White was re- elected to his second term in Congress from North Carolina's 2nd congressional district. (In 1899, after North Carolina Democrats passed a new state constitution to disenfranchise blacks, White chose not to seek a third term in Congress. He told the Chicago Tribune, \\"I cannot live in North Carolina and be a man and be treated as a man.\\" He moved to Washington, DC.) :(2) that the holding citing the 14th Amendment perversely made redistricting that advantaged blacks subject to more rigorous scrutiny than redistricting advantaging other non-racial groups, though the 14th amendment was intended to provide for equal protection for blacks after emancipation and abolition of slavery, and; :(3) that allowing race-based voting blocs is distinct from other forms of affirmative action, insofar as allowing race-based blocs does not deny another person her rights and privileges, as for example, race-based hiring and retention practices do. Impact Subsequent decisions on similar issues have made use of Shaw and refined it, though the four dissenters have held fast in their belief that no cause of action exists. For instance, Miller v. Johnson, , which concerned a similarly irregular district in Georgia, was also decided 5-4, with the majority comprising exactly the same five justices as in Shaw. See also * Hunt v.

In August 1947 in what was the final cynical act of a collapsing empire, the British left old India divided. Arbitrary lines were drawn on the map of India, dividing not only the country but also provinces, in particular the old Punjab Province (British India). The results of partition were catastrophic. All in the name of religion and nationalism, people who had lived together in harmony for centuries committed mindless acts of violence against each other resulting in over one million deaths that included Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus. An estimated 75,000 women were raped and over twelve million people were uprooted. Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India and Muslims to Pakistan. During these troubled times, there were a select few who did not give in to the acts of barbarism. One such person was a young Muslim man who refused to participate in the fires of hate and destruction burning around him. During the hostilities, he found a young Sikh girl who had been separated from her family. Risking the anger of the mobs, he brought her home and offered her sanctuary. As the fires of hate began to burn out, families began to come to terms with their loss of the loved ones on both sides. Those who could not be found were presumed dead. The young girl was touched by the way the boy had protected her against the ruthless mobs, risking his own life. Eventually they fell in love. She converted to Islam and they married. Years later, this girl becomes a dying grandmother herself and her last wish is to meet her family, back in India. Having made some enquires, she discovered that her family had migrated to Chandigarh, India. Knowing her family would disown her, if they discovered that she had converted to Islam, she contacts her sister, pretending to be a long lost Muslim friend and invited her and her family to come to Lahore for a religious pilgrimage to 'Nankana Sahib' a highly revered Sikh Temple, where thousands of Sikhs travel to visit it every year. The Sikh family comes to Lahore where the two sisters live together as friends, not knowing about their real relationship as sisters. During their stay with the Muslim family, history began to repeat itself. Preetam, daughter of the Sikh family started to get friendly with Shamil Khan, the son of the Muslim family. When the Sikh family discovers that a relationship was blossoming, they quickly return to Chandigarh, however, the young couple keep in touch on the telephone and the Internet and their love grows stronger. Preetam's family, realizing the potential problems, send her off to Malaysia to marry her fianc√©. Shamil is heart broken at suddenly losing contact with Preetam. Shamil's family, watching his despair, persuade him to travel to Malaysia to complete his education. As fate would have it, Shamil sees Preetam in Kuala Lumpur, only a few days before she is due to marry. What can they do? Run away together and face the wrath of their families ? Or accept the decision of their elders and sacrifice their love for each other? Can their love, cultural barriers survive the pressures of culture, tradition, inbred hatred and religion of their elders? As in fables, will love conquer all or will the harsh realities of life suffocate the young lovers into submission? Film business The film did an average amount of business at the box office.

Sonnenschein in the 1970s. It states that the excess demand curve for a market populated with utility-maximizing rational agents can take the shape of any function that is continuous, has homogeneity degree zero, and is in accordance with Walras's law. This implies that market processes will not necessarily reach a unique and stable equilibrium point. More recently, Jordi Andreu, Pierre-Andr√© Chiappori, and Ivar Ekeland extended this result to market demand curves, both for individual commodities and for the aggregate demand of an economy as a whole. This means that demand curves may take on highly irregular shapes, even if all individual agents in the market are perfectly rational. In contrast with usual assumptions, the quantity demanded of a commodity may not decrease when the price increases. Frank Hahn regarded the theorem as a dangerous critique against mainstream neoclassical economics. History of the proof The concept of an excess demand function is important in general equilibrium theories, because it acts as a signal for the market to adjust prices. If the value of the excess demand function is positive, then more units of a commodity are being demanded than can be supplied; there is a shortage. If excess demand is negative, then more units are being supplied than are demanded; there is a glut. The assumption is that the rate of change of prices will be proportional to excess demand, so that the adjustment of prices will eventually lead to an equilibrium state in which excess demand for all commodities is zero. In the 1970s, mathematical economists worked hard to establish rigorous microfoundations for widely used equilibrium models, on the basis of the assumption that individuals are utility-maximizing rational agents (the \\"utility hypothesis\\"). It was already known that this assumption put certain loose restrictions on the excess demand functions for individuals (continuity and Walras's law), and that these restrictions were \\"inherited\\" by the market excess demand function. In a 1973 paper, Hugo Sonnenschein posed the question of whether these were the only restrictions that could be placed on a market excess demand function. He conjectured that the answer was \\"yes,\\" and made preliminary steps toward proving it. These results were extended by Rolf Mantel, and then by G√©rard Debreu in 1974, who proved that, as long as there are at least as many agents in the market as there are commodities, the market excess demand function inherits only the following properties of individual excess demand functions: *Continuity *Homogeneity of degree zero, *Walras's law, and *A boundary condition assuring that, as the price approaches zero, demand does not diverge to infinity. These inherited properties are not sufficient to guarantee that the excess demand curve is downward-sloping, as is usually assumed. The uniqueness of the equilibrium point is also not guaranteed. There may be more than one price vector at which the excess demand function is zero, which is the standard definition of equilibrium in this context. Further developments In the wake of these initial publications, several scholars have extended the initial Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu results in a variety of ways. In a 1976 paper, Rolf Mantel showed that the theorem still holds even if the very strong assumption is added that all consumers have homothetic preferences. This means that the utility that consumers assign to a commodity will always be exactly proportional with the amount of the commodity offered; for example, one million oranges would be valued exactly one million times more than one orange. Furthermore, Alan Kirman and Karl-Josef Koch proved in 1986 that the SMD theorem still holds even if all agents are assumed to have identical preferences, and the distribution of income is assumed to be fixed across time and independent of prices. The only income distribution that is not permissible is a uniform one where all individuals have the same income and therefore, since they have the same preferences, they are all identical. For a while it was unclear whether SMD-style results also applied to the market demand curve itself, and not just the excess demand curve. But in 1982 Jordi Andreu established an important preliminary result suggesting that this was the case, and in 1999 Pierre-Andr√© Chiappori and Ivar Ekeland used vector calculus to prove that the Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu results do indeed apply to the market demand curve. This means that market demand curves may take on highly irregular shapes, quite unlike textbook models, even if all individual agents in the market are perfectly rational. Significance In the 1982 book Handbook of Mathematical Economics, Hugo Sonnenschein explained some of the implications of his theorem for general equilibrium theory: A possible market demand curve according to the Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu results In other words, it cannot be assumed that the demand curve for a single market, let alone an entire economy, must be smoothly downward-sloping simply because the demand curves of individual consumers are downward-sloping. This is an instance of the more general aggregation problem, which deals with the theoretical difficulty of modeling the behavior of large groups of individuals in the same way that an individual is modeled. Frank Ackerman points out that it is a corollary of Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu that a Walrasian auction will not always find a unique and stable equilibrium, even in ideal conditions: L√©on Walras' auction model requires that the price of a commodity will always rise in response to excess demand, and that it will always fall in response to a glut. But SMD shows that this will not always be the case, because the excess demand function need not be uniformly downward-sloping. The theorem has also raised concerns about the falsifiability of general equilibrium theory, because it seems to imply that almost any observed pattern of market price and quantity data could be interpreted as being the result of individual utility- maximizing behavior. In other words, Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu raises questions about the degree to which general equilibrium theory can produce testable predictions about aggregate market variables. For this reason, Andreu Mas-Colell referred to the theorem as the ‚ÄúAnything Goes Theorem‚Äù in his graduate-level microeconomics textbook. Some economists have made attempts to address this problem, with Donald Brown and Rosa Matzkin deriving some polynomial restrictions on market variables by modeling the equilibrium state of a market as a topological manifold. However, Abu Turab Rizvi comments that this result does not practically change the situation very much, because Brown and Matzkin's restrictions are formulated on the basis of individual-level observations about budget constraints and incomes, while general equilibrium models purport to explain changes in aggregate market-level data. The Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu results have led some economists, such as Werner Hildenbrand, to abandon the project of explaining the characteristics of the market demand curve on the basis of individual rationality. Instead, these authors attempt to explain the law of demand in terms of the organization of society as a whole, and in particular the distribution of income. Explanation In mathematical terms, the number of equations that make up a market excess demand function is equal to the number of individual excess demand functions, which in turn equals the number of prices to be solved for. By Walras's law, if all but one of the excess demands is zero then the last one has to be zero as well. This means that there is one redundant equation and we can normalize one of the prices or a combination of all prices (in other words, only relative prices are determined; not the absolute price level). Having done this, the number of equations equals the number of unknowns and we have a determinate system. However, because the equations are non-linear there is no guarantee of a unique solution. Furthermore, even though reasonable assumptions can guarantee that the individual excess-demand functions have a unique root, these assumptions do not guarantee that the aggregate demand does as well. There are several things to be noted. First, even though there may be multiple equilibria, every equilibrium is still guaranteed, under standard assumptions, to be Pareto efficient. However, the different equilibria are likely to have different distributional implications and may be ranked differently by any given social welfare function. Second, by the Hopf index theorem, in regular economies the number of equilibria will be finite and all of them will be locally unique. This means that comparative statics, or the analysis of how the equilibrium changes when there are shocks to the economy, can still be relevant as long as the shocks are not too large. But this leaves the question of the stability of the equilibrium unanswered, since a comparative statics perspective does not tell us what happens when the market moves away from an equilibrium. Extension to incomplete markets The extension to incomplete markets was first conjectured by Andreu Mas-Colell in 1986. To do this he remarks that Walras's law and homogeneity of degree zero can be understood as the fact that the excess demand only depends on the budget set itself. Hence, homogeneity is only saying that excess demand is the same if the budget sets are the same. This formulation extends to incomplete markets. So does Walras's law if seen as budget feasibility of excess-demand function. The first incomplete markets Sonnenschein‚ÄìMantel‚ÄìDebreu type of result was obtained by Jean-Marc Bottazzi and Thorsten Hens. Other works expanded the type of assets beyond the popular real assets structures like Chiappori and Ekland. All such results are local. Finally, Takeshi Momi (2003) extended the approach by Bottazzi and Hens as a global result.

The club fields a team in both the Men's and Women's NBL1. The club is a division of the overarching Border Basketball Club, the major administrative basketball organisation in the Albury‚ÄìWodonga region. The Bandits play their home games at the Lauren Jackson Sports Centre. For sponsorship reasons, the two teams are known as the Southern Vale Homes Bandits. Club history Men's team In 1984, a team known as the Wodonga Border Bulldogs entered the South Eastern Basketball League (SEBL). Based out of the Victorian city of Wodonga, the Bulldogs' home venue was the Wodonga Sports and Leisure Centre. The Wodonga stadium was the original home court in 1984 before the venue split games with the newly constructed Albury Sports Stadium the following year. The Bulldogs' final game they hosted at the Wodonga Sports and Leisure Centre was on 25 August 1985 before changing their name to the Albury Wodonga Bandits in 1986 and re-locating to nearby Albury. Not a lot of success came for the Bandits over their first 17 seasons in the SEBL/SEABL/CBA/ABA. That changed in 2001 when coach Leigh Gooding and players Allen McCowan, Matt Sheehan, Russell Hinder, Nick Grylewicz and Nick Payne helped lead the Bandits to championship success in the ABA's East Conference. The Bandits next tasted success in 2012 when they not only won the SEABL's South Conference title, but took home the SEABL National Championship after defeating the East Conference champion Dandenong Rangers in the grand final. In 2015, the Bandits returned to the SEABL Grand Final after winning the East Conference Championship, but couldn't claim National Championship honours after losing to the Mount Gambier Pioneers. Women's team In 2006, an Albury Wodonga Bandits women's team entered the SEABL. After missing the playoffs in each of their first three seasons, the Lady Bandits qualified for the post-season for the first time in 2009 behind coach Kennedy Kereama and star import duo Lisa Wallbutton and Toni Edmondson. Heading into the 2014 season, the Lady Bandits had a 39‚Äì153 win/loss record.

He is best known for his work in the areas of marching percussion, drum & bugle corps, and marching band. Raised in Casper, Wyoming, Fred followed his older brother Ken, also a drummer, into the Casper Troopers Drum & Bugle Corps at the age of 12 in 1959. He was a member of the Troopers for ten years until he aged out following his 21st birthday in 1968. Although he attended school at California State University in Fullerton and taught the newly organized Anaheim Kingsmen from 1965-1967, each summer he would return to teach and perform with his hometown corps. In 1968, Fred moved to northern California where he attended San Jose State and studied percussion with Tony Cirone. During this time he also began to instruct and write for another new drum corps ‚Äì the Santa Clara Vanguard, with whom he would work for 12 seasons. During his tenure there, the Vanguard drumline won an unprecedented five national DCI \\"high drums\\" titles; years 1973, 1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979. Following his graduation from San Jose State in 1970, he taught high school music programs in Bergenfield, New Jersey where he met Dennis DeLucia. \\"Fred Sanford made his mark on the world of percussion with his extraordinary arrangements for the Santa Clara Vanguard,\\" recalls DeLucia. \\"For the first time in drum corps, percussion charts were magnificent orchestrations that beautifully captured the style and elegance of the music and made the horn line sound much better than it would have sounded by itself! My personal favorite ‚Äì \\"Young Person‚Äôs Guide to the Orchestra\\" (1974) ‚Äì was a landmark in voicing, rhythmic interest and accompaniment that featured the drumline in the most musical way imaginable.\\" The ‚Äò70s also saw Fred begin his association with the Slingerland Drum Company where he was instrumental in designing the TDR snare, Cut-a-way tenor drums, Tonal bass drums and fiberglass vest/harnesses to carry marching percussion. He also began another important aspect of his career, teaching educational clinics on marching percussion around the country and eventually around the world. During that decade, Sanford also worked with the Madison Scouts, the Alberta All-Girls Drum & Bugle Band, and The Blue Devils. During the early 1980s, Sanford joined the Ludwig Drum Company as a Product Development Manager and Staff Clinician. In addition to his drum & bugle corps experiences, Sanford was the percussion coordinator for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles and also worked with the McDonald‚Äôs All-American Band at various national parades. Since 1985, he served as a marching percussion consultant for the Yamaha Corporation of America and developed the SFZ marching snare drum and the Power Lite Marching Series. Fred developed the Yamaha Sounds of Summer band camps which each summer attracted over 10,000 students who studied under Fred‚Äôs direction. Fred Sanford was also active in the Percussive Arts Society, serving on the PAS Marching Percussion Committee as well as being the \\"voice\\" of the Marching Percussion Festival for almost two decades. Sanford is a member of the DCI Hall of Fame. He died in 2000. The Percussion Championship trophy at the Drum Corps International World Championships is named in his honor. References *P.A.S.

It is located on a point on the northern bank of the Brisbane River. The triangular shaped area is bounded by the Brisbane River to the east, south and west. The point, known at its tip as Gardens Point, slopes upward to the north-west where the city is bounded by parkland and the inner city suburb of Spring Hill to the north. The CBD is bounded to the north-east by the suburb of Fortitude Valley. To the west the CBD is bounded by Petrie Terrace, which in 2010 was reinstated as a suburb (after being made a locality of Brisbane City in the 1970s).  Geography  Skyline of the central business district from Mount Coot-tha 2017. The Brisbane central business district is an area of densely concentrated skyscrapers and other buildings, interspersed by several parks such as Roma Street Parklands, City Botanic Gardens and Wickham Park. It occupies an area of 1.367 km¬≤. The City is laid out according to a grid pattern surveyed during the city's early colonial days, a feature typical of most Australian street patterns. Most central streets are named after members of the House of Hanover. Queen Street (named in honour of Queen Victoria) is Brisbane's traditional main street and contains its largest pedestrian mall, the Queen Street Mall. Streets named after female members (Adelaide, Alice, Ann, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Mary) run parallel to Queen Street and perpendicular to streets named after male members (Albert, Edward, George, and William). The CBD's squares include King George Square, Post Office Square and ANZAC Square (home to the city's central war memorial). The Brisbane central business district was built on a spur of the Taylor Range with the highest spot in the suburb being Wickham Terrace. North Quay is an area in the CBD that was a landing point during the first European exploration of the Brisbane River.  Petrie Bight  Petrie Bight is a reach of the Brisbane River (), which gives its name to the small pocket of land centred on the area under the Story Bridge's northern point, around the Brisbane River to Admiralty Towers II. The location was originally known as Petrie Gardens and was an early settlement farm, one of two that provided food for the colony. The site was named after Andrew Petrie and has been the base for water police and in earlier times wharves. The location of Customs House and the preference for wharves was due to site being directly downstream from the central business district.  History  On 2 April 1860 the Queensland Government opened its first school, the Brisbane National School in Adelaide Street under headmaster John Rendall with an initial enrolment of 50 boys and 8 girls. The Brisbane City Library opened in 1965, moving into Brisbane Square in 2006.  Buildings and precincts  The Albert Street Uniting Church Soleil building under construction Up until 1964, a Brisbane City Council regulation limited building heights to . Some of the first skyscrapers built in the CBD include the SGIO building (now Suncorp Plaza) in 1970 and AMP Place in 1977. In the last few decades the number of apartment buildings that have been constructed has increased substantially. Brisbane is home to several of Australia's tallest buildings. Brisbane's tallest buildings are Brisbane Skytower at 270 metres, One William Street at 260 metres, Soleil at 243 metres, Aurora Tower at 207 metres, Riparian Plaza at 200 metres, One One One Eagle Street at 195 metres, and Infinity at 249 metres, which was completed in 2014. The Brisbane CBD is one of the major business hubs in Australia. The City contains many tall office buildings occupied by organisations, businesses and all three levels of government that have emerged into a number of precincts. The areas around the Queen Street Mall and Adelaide Street is primarily a retail precinct. A legal precinct exists around the various court buildings located around the intersections of George Street and Adelaide and Ann Streets. The government precinct is an area centred on the Executive Building that includes many Queensland Government offices. 111 George Street, Mineral House, and Education House are also located here.  Schools  High rise view of the CBD at night. The city is serviced by a number of schools in the surrounding suburbs including the Petrie Terrace State School in Paddington and The Albert Park Flexi School in Petrie Terrace.  Rental prices  Like most other Australian capital cities, Brisbane has experienced dramatic rises in rental prices for residential and office space before the global financial crisis. At the beginning of 2008, the Brisbane central business district contained 1.7 million square metres of office space. High demand in the office market had pushed vacancy rates in the Brisbane CBD to 0.7% by January 2008, the lowest in Australia. Premium grade office space was even less vacant with an occupancy rate of 99.9%. By the end of 2009 the situation had reversed. In mid 2013 the market for office space had declined to its worst position in two decades with a vacancy rate of just under 13%.  Attractions  Brisbane City Hall houses the Museum of Brisbane and offices of the Brisbane City Council. Major landmarks and attractions in the CBD include City Hall (including the Museum of Brisbane), the Story Bridge, the Howard Smith Wharves, ANZAC Square, St John's Cathedral, the Brisbane River and its Riverwalk network, the City Botanic Gardens, Roma Street Parkland, Queensland Parliament House, Old Government House and Customs House.  Heritage listings  The National Australia Bank Building, located on Queen Street, was heritage listed in October 1992. Brisbane has many heritage-listed sites, including: * a number of properties in Adelaide Street, Brisbane * a number of properties in Albert Street, Brisbane * a number of properties in Alice Street, Brisbane * a number of properties in Ann Street, Brisbane * Boundary Street: Howard Smith Wharves * a number of properties in Charlotte Street, Brisbane * Coronation Drive: Coronation Drive retaining wall * 15 Countess Street: Roma Street railway station * a number of properties in Creek Street, Brisbane * 118 Eagle Street: Mooney Memorial Fountain * 118A Eagle Street: Eagle Street Fig Trees * a number of properties in Edward Street, Brisbane * a number of properties in Elizabeth Street, Brisbane * a number of properties in Margaret Street, Brisbane * 20-30 Market Street: Wenley House * a number of properties in Mary Street, Brisbane * a number of properties in North Quay, Brisbane * a number of properties in Queen Street, Brisbane * Skew Street: First Brisbane Burial Ground * Skew Street: William Jolly Bridge * 168 Turbot Street: Brisbane Dental Hospital and College * 224 Turbot Street: King Edward Park Air Raid Shelter * 436 Upper Roma Street: Hellesvere * a number of properties in William Street, Brisbane  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 9,460 people in Brisbane City. 32.2% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 8.9%, South Korea 8.3%, England 3.7%, Taiwan 3.2% and Brazil 2.8%. 43.7% of people only spoke English at home.

Transport  By road, four road bridges connect the CBD with the southern bank of the Brisbane River: the Captain Cook Bridge, the Victoria Bridge, the William Jolly Bridge and the Go Between Bridge. The Story Bridge connects Fortitude Valley with Kangaroo Point and provides access to the city from the southern bank. The Captain Cook Bridge connects the Pacific Motorway, south of the river, with the Riverside Expressway which runs along the south western edge of the city. Heading under and bypassing the CBD is the Clem Jones Tunnel. By bicycle and foot, the Goodwill Bridge allows cross river access to South Bank. The Kurilpa Bridge allows cross river access from North Quay to South Brisbane. Cyclists and pedestrians may also cross while using the Victoria, William Jolly, Go Between and Story road bridges. The Brisbane central business district is the central hub for all public transport services in Brisbane. Bus services are centred on the Queen Street bus station and King George Square busway station. Suburban train services pass through Central railway station, and Roma Street railway station. Roma Street also serves as the terminus for long distance and country services. The central business district is served by various city ferries. Brisbane's CityCat high speed ferry service, popular with tourists and commuters, operates services along the Brisbane River between the University of Queensland and Northshore Hamilton, stopping at several CBD wharves. The Brisbane Riverwalk, a pedestrian and cyclist pathway adjoins the central business district along the river bank. underground bus station  In popular culture  The Brisbane CBD has featured in a number of films, including: * Inspector Gadget 2, the sequel to Inspector Gadget, featured many scenes showing the Brisbane CBD, South Bank and Kangaroo Point. * The Marine, a film featuring John Cena, featured the Golden Triangle district of the CBD, during a scene in which an explosion occurred. * Fool's Gold, a 2008 film featured the CBD primarily the Botanic Gardens throughout the beginning of the film. * One of Jackie Chan's films, Jackie Chan's First Strike, featured the city in many scenes to the end of the film from Fortitude Valley, east of the CBD. * The Brisbane CBD was used in Powderfinger's 2009 music video \\"All of the Dreamers\\". * The 2009 vampire film Daybreakers was filmed in Brisbane. * In the 2015 film San Andreas starring Dwayne Johnson, several streets of the CBD were used to portray San Francisco. * In the 2017 film Thor: Ragnarok, Mary Street was used in a scene with Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston to portray New York City.

In addition to serving in academia and as adviser to political administrations, he was a distinguished fellow in International Diplomacy and later executive vice president at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C from 2001-2018Brookings: MARTIN S. INDYK. He took leave from the Brookings Institution to serve as the U.S. Special Envoy for Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian Negotiations from 2013 to 2014. He is currently a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign RelationsCouncil on Foreign Relations: Martin S. Indyk\\". Indyk served twice as United States ambassador to Israel and also as Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs during the Clinton Administration. He is known as the framer of the U.S. policy of dual containment in that period, which sought to 'contain' Iraq and Iran. These were viewed as the United States' two most important strategic adversaries at the time. He is the author of Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peacemaking Diplomacy in the Middle East (2009). Biography Martin Indyk was born in 1951 in London, United Kingdom, to a Jewish family who had immigrated from Poland.Haaretz: \\"Former 'Meet the Press' host David Gregory writing book on his Jewish faith\\" by Anthony Weiss August 24, 2014 His family moved to Australia, where he was raised, growing up in the Sydney suburb of Castlecrag. His older brother is the Australian academic and publisher Ivor Indyk. He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1972. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Indyk spent time volunteering in a kibbutz in southern Israel, an experience he has called \\"a defining moment in my life.\\"Nathan Guttman, \\"Mideast Mediator Martin Indyk Draws Ire From Both Sides of Israeli Spectrum\\", Jewish Daily Forward (August 2, 2013). He returned to graduate school and received a PhD in international relations from the Australian National University in 1977. He married Jill Collier, with whom he had two children, Sarah and Jacob. They have divorced. Indyk emigrated to the United States by 1982 and started work with a lobbying group in Washington, DC. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993.Al Kamen, Inside: State, Washington Post (February 2, 1995). Indyk is a Reform Jew. Political and diplomatic career In 1982, Indyk began working as a deputy research director for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington. From 1985 Indyk served eight years as the founding Executive Director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research institute specializing in analysis of Middle East policy.Mearsheimer, John J.; Walt, Stephen M., The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, Macmillan, September 4, 2007. Cf. p.152 He has been an adjunct professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, where he taught Israeli politics and foreign policy. Indyk has also taught at the Middle East Institute at Columbia University, the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University, and the Department of Politics at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Indyk has published widely on U.S. policy toward the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli peace process, on U.S.‚ÄìIsraeli relations, and on the threats to Middle East stability posed by Iraq and Iran. He served as special assistant to President Bill Clinton and as senior director of Near East and South Asian Affairs at the United States National Security Council. While at the NSC, he served as principal adviser to the President and the National Security Advisor on Arab‚ÄìIsraeli issues, Iraq, Iran, and South Asia. He was a senior member of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's Middle East peace team and served as the White House representative on the U.S. Israel Science and Technology Commission. He served two stints as United States Ambassador to Israel, from April 1995 to September 1997, and from January 2000 to July 2001. He was the first and so far, the only, foreign-born US ambassador to Israel. He has served on the board of the New Israel Fund. Indyk currently serves on the Advisory Board for DC based non-profit America Abroad Media. On July 29, 2013, Indyk was appointed by President Barack Obama as Washington's special Middle East envoy for the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas favored his appointment. He resigned from this position June 27, 2014, returning to the Brookings Institution as its vice president and director for foreign policy. In 2018, he left Brookings for the Council on Foreign Relations.Brookings: MARTIN S. INDYK Controversy In 2000, Indyk was placed under investigation by the FBI after allegations arose that he improperly handled sensitive material by using an unclassified laptop computer on an airplane flight to prepare his memos of meetings with foreign leaders. There was no indication that any classified material had been compromised, and no indication of espionage. Indyk was \\"apparently ... the first serving U.S. ambassador to be stripped of government security clearance.\\" The Los Angeles Times reported that \\"veteran diplomats complained that Indyk was being made a scapegoat for the kinds of security lapses that are rather common among envoys who take classified work home from the office.\\" Indyk's clearance was suspended but was reinstated the next month, \\"for the duration of the current crisis,\\" given \\"the continuing turmoil in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza [Strip] and for compelling national security reasons.\\"  Criticism   Receiving donations from Qatar In 2014, Indyk came under scrutiny when a New York Times investigation revealed that wealthy Gulf state of Qatar made a $14.8 million, four-year donation to Brookings Institution, in order to fund two Brookings initiatives, the Brookings Center in Doha and the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World. The Times investigation found that Brookings was one of more than a dozen influential Washington think tanks and research organizations that \\"have received tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments in recent years while pushing United States government officials to adopt policies that often reflect the donors' priorities.\\" A number of scholars interviewed by the Times expressed alarm at the trend, saying that the \\"donations have led to implicit agreements that the research groups would refrain from criticizing the donor governments.\\" The revelation of the think tank's choice to accept the payment from Qatar was especially controversial because at the time, Indyk was acting as a peace negotiator between Israel and the Palestinians, and because Qatar funds jihadist groups in the Middle East and is the main financial backer of Hamas, \\"the mortal enemy of both the State of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party.\\" Hamas political chief Khaled Meshaal, who directs Hamas's operations against Israel, is also harbored by Qatar. Indyk defended the arrangement with Qatar, contending that it did not influence the think tank's work and that \\"to be policy-relevant, we need to engage policy makers.\\" However, the arrangement between Qatar and Brookings caused Israeli government officials to doubt Indyk's impartiality. Of views on Israel Indyk's career has \\"featured two abiding, and at times competing, characteristics: his support for Israel, and his disdain for Israel's West Bank settlement activity.\\"Nathan Guttman, How Martin Indyk Went From AIPAC Man To Blaming Israel for Talk's Failure, Jewish Daily Forward (May 14, 2014). Indyk's views \\"have irked both Israel and the Palestinians at various times.\\" Isi Leibler criticized Indyk in a 2010 Jerusalem Post op-ed, calling him a \\"anti-Israel apologist.\\"Isi Leibler, From pro-Israel to anti-Israel apologist, Jerusalem Post (April 29, 2010). In 2014, Ha'aretz reported that \\"Indyk is being identified in Jerusalem as the anonymous source\\" in an article by Nahum Barnea of the Yedioth Ahronoth, 'in which unnamed American officials blamed Israel for the failure of the peace talks.\\"'US envoy to resign after blaming settlements for talks failure', Jewish Telegraphic Agency & Times of Israel Staff (May 5, 2014). The anonymous source in Yediot Acharonot was quoted as saying: \\"The Jewish people are supposed to be smart; it is true that they‚Äôre also considered a stubborn nation. You're supposed to know how to read the map: In the 21st century, the world will not keep tolerating the Israeli occupation. The occupation threatens Israel's status in the world and threatens Israel as a Jewish state...The Palestinians are tired of the status quo. They will get their state in the end ‚Äì whether through violence or by turning to international organizations.\\" The remarks angered Israeli officials. Media appearances While promoting his book, Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy, on 8 January 2009, Indyk engaged in a discussion of Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace negotiations with Norman Finkelstein of Democracy Now!. Indyk indicated he felt \\"sandbagged\\" by not being informed \\"that I was going to be in some kind of debate with Norman Finkelstein. I‚Äôm not interested in doing that.

It was a stegosaur found in China. Discovery Shoulder spine The first fossil was found in 1985 by Ouyang Hui at Pengtang near Jinquan and was reported upon in 1986 by Gao Ruiqi and colleagues, mistaking it for a specimen of Tuojiangosaurus.Gao, R., Zhu, S. & Huang, D. 1986. [Chinese] [The discovery of some stegosaurian shoulder spines in Zigong Municipality]. Vertebrata PalAsiatica 24: 78-79 The type species, Gigantspinosaurus sichuanensis, was described and named by Ouyang in 1992 in an abstract of a lecture. The generic name is derived from Latin gigas or giganteus, \\"enormous\\", and spina, \\"spine\\", in reference to the gigantic shoulder spines. The specific name refers to Sichuan. The name was generally considered a nomen nudum in the West, until in 2006 it was disclosed that the abstract contained a sufficient description. Despite its uncertain nomenclatural status, images of Gigantspinosaurus had appeared in several sources. Public awareness of this animal was increased in early 2006 when Tracy Ford, considering it a validly established taxon, published a short article on reconstructing it. Ford suggested that earlier reconstructions of Gigantspinosaurus attached the shoulder spines upside-down, and his new reconstruction shows the spine extending somewhat upwards, ending higher than the top of the animal's back. Susannah Maidment and Wei Guangbiao in 2006 concluded that G. sichuanensis was a valid taxon in their review of Late Jurassic Chinese stegosaurs, but did not redescribe it because at that time it was under study by Zigong Dinosaur Museum staff. In fact, a Chinese redescription by Peng Guangzhao and colleagues in 2005 would predate Maidment's publication.Peng, G., Ye, Y., Gao, Y., Shu, C.-K., & Jiang, S., 2005, Jurassic Dinosaur Faunas in Zigong, Zigong, Sichuan Scientific and Technological Publishing House, 236 pp The holotype, ZDM 0019, was found in layers of the Upper Shaximiao Formation of Zigong (Sichuan province), which date to the Oxfordian. It consists of a partial skeleton of a probably subadult individual missing the skull (though the lower jaws are present), hind feet, and the tail end. Apart from skeletal elements also plates, spines and scutes have been found. At the left shoulder an impression of the skin had been preserved. The specimen is part of the collection of the Zigong Dinosaur Museum and has as a mounted restored skeleton been on display since 1996. In 2005 Peng e.a. reported a second specimen, ZDM 0156, a pelvis found at Chenjia near Fuquan. Description Restoration of Gigantspinosaurus (middle) and other dinosaurs from the Shaximiao Formation Gigantspinosaurus was described by Peng and colleagues as a \\"medium-sized stegosaur\\". It was estimated by Gregory S. Paul in 2010 to have been about long and in weight.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 222 Gigantspinosaurus has a distinctive appearance with relatively small dorsal plates and greatly enlarged shoulder spines, spinae parascapulares, twice the length of the shoulder blades on which they rested via large flat bases. The plates on the neck are small and triangular. The head must have been relatively large with thirty teeth in each lower jaw. The hips are very broad and the low neural spines of the four sacral vertebrae and the first tail vertebra have been fused into a single plate. It also had robust forelimbs. The skin impressions were described by Xing Lida and colleagues in 2008. They cover a surface of and show rosettes with a central pentagonal or hexagonal scale surrounded by thirteen to fourteen ridged smaller square, pentagonal or hexagonal scales with a diameter of .Xing, L.D., Peng, G.Z. & Shu, C.K. 2008. \\"Stegosaurian skin impressions from the Upper Jurassic Shangshaximiao Formation, Zigong, Sichuan, China: a new observation\\". Geological Bulletin of China 27: 1049-1053 Classification Lower jaw A study by Maidment indicated that Gigantspinosaurus is the most basal known member of the Stegosauria. Peng and colleagues, however, placed it in the Huayangosaurinae. A 2018 redescription by Hao et al clarified aspects of the anatomy and found that it was an intermediate basal stegosaur, sharing basal traits with huayangosaurines as well as somewhat more advanced traits with other stegosaurs. Nevertheless, this analysis found that it was not the most basal stegosaur, as the huayangosaurids Chungkingosaurus and Huayangosaurus were considered more basal.

Delia Delfina Degliuomini was born to Italian Argentine parents in Ingeniero Luiggi, a small La Pampa Province town, in 1913. Her family relocated to Buenos Aires in 1917 and lived in modest circumstances. She was able to attain secondary education, however, and shortly afterwards met Juan Carlos Parodi. The couple operated a small business and in 1944, Delia Parodi was hired as a stenographer in the Department of Labor by its new appointee, Colonel Juan Per√≥n. Parodi assisted Per√≥n in his fundraising efforts dealing with the devastating 1944 San Juan earthquake, and became close to Eva Duarte (who would soon be Per√≥n's fianc√©e and most influential adviser). Following Per√≥n's election to the Presidency in 1946, Parodi was transferred to the Province of San Luis, where she participated as an enumerator during the 1947 Census. The experience earned her a promotion as a local ombudsman in the Las Ca√±itas section of Palermo (today an upscale ward in Buenos Aires).C√°mara de Diputados de la Naci√≥n: Proyecto de resoluci√≥n The enactment of female suffrage in Argentina in 1949 and Parodi's neighborhood work earned her a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1951 as one of the first 22 women in Congress. The first woman to make a formal speech in the Argentine Congress, she was active in intellectual property and consumer rights. Following the First Lady's death in 1952, she was elected titular head of the Peronist Women's Party, and represented her country in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. On April 25, 1953, she was unanimously elected First Vice President of the Chamber, becoming the first Argentine Woman to hold an elected leadership position in any branch (to date, she remains the highest-ranking woman in Argentine Congressional history). Parodi was imprisoned on Per√≥n's September 19, 1955, overthrow, and she remained in custody until March 1958, shortly after a new election. Pardoned by the newly elected President Arturo Frondizi (who had won with Per√≥n's endorsement), Parodi remained in exile in neighboring Uruguay and separated from her husband; she returned to Argentina in secret to attend her husband's funeral (from which she was forced to flee after police recognized her). Parodi relocated to Madrid, where Per√≥n had lived since 1961. Undeterred, she helped organize the aging leader's planned return to Argentina in December 1964. Posing as \\"Delia and Juan Sosa\\" and sporting Paraguayan passports, she and Per√≥n were intercepted in Rio de Janeiro by Brazilian Intelligence. The fiasco resulted in an Interpol arrest order against her and her detention in Paris. She remained in contact with Per√≥n, however, and joined his entourage on the leader's June 20, 1973, return to Argentina. Per√≥n died in office a year later, and Parodi's own, worsening health (as well as a violent dictatorship) kept her in a low profile in subsequent years. Following a return to democracy in 1983, she took part in numerous interviews and seminars, and published an autobiography. Parodi died in Buenos Aires on May 13, 1991, at age 78. Her casket was displayed in Congress' Hall of Lost Steps, and the main press conference room of the Chamber of Deputies was named in her honor in 2003.

It was first published by Bantam in hardcover in 1990. Fade to Black is set in the advertising world, and as such is a nice counterpoint to Stout's Wolfe novel Before Midnight (1955). Whereas the earlier book centres on jealousies within a large and established agency, and a nationwide perfume contest, the Goldsborough book is concerned with a mid-sized boutique agency coping with issues such as idea theft between ad agencies and television spots for the Super Bowl, which was still ten years in the future when Before Midnight was written. Plot summary Nearly all the principals in the book have something to hide, and therefore something for Archie and Wolfe to inquire about, but not every secret is criminal, and the balance between private lives (including a passionate but commercially meaningless liaison between two hostile principals) and responsible disclosure is handled adroitly, and far better than in most Rex Stout novels. Just as in Before Midnight the agency partners have strong personality clashes, but this is seen in this book as a price that is paid for complementary talents in a boutique firm. Genesis Wolfe's right-hand man and amanuensis Archie Goodwin is attending a Super Bowl party thrown by his good friend Lily Rowan at her East Side penthouse in Manhattan. During the game, there is a spectacular commercial involving parachutists, acrobats, and more promoting a cherry-flavored soft drink call Cherr-o-kee. One of the partners of the ad agency that put on that stunt, Rod Mills, is also at the party, and takes Goodwin aside to say that he'd like help with a problem. Later, all three partners of Mills/Lake/Ryman meet at Wolfe's office discuss an acute problem of industrial espionage they've been having lately: their best ideas being discovered and used by a larger agency representing another cherry-flavored soft drink. Development The problem as presented by M/L/R is simple: to find the spy within the agency: the source of the industrial esponiage. Therefore, Goodwin has to look into possible links between members of the firm and its rival. While this remains elusive, it becomes clear that the executive of the rival drink's campaign is the recipient of the information, but it isn't long before he is found dead in his apartment (by Archie, who else?). This prompts the owner of Cherr-o-kee, a reclusive part-Cherokee billionaire named Acker Foreman to pay Wolfe a visit, along with his two adult sons, Arnold and Stephen. Despite the tense situation, Wolfe gains Acker Foreman's respect with his knowledge of his career and of Cherokee history, especially the Trail of Tears (documented poignantly by de Tocqueville in Democracy in America). Arnold, however, displays the same hostility as he has to M/L/R personnel. D√©nouement After further investigation, Wolfe gathers the interested parties at his brownstone to lay out his proposed solution, this time without enough evidence to please law enforcement. However, since his mandate is simply to stop industrial espionage, he can (arguably) collect his fee. The rest is left for the reader to discover.

Other sources place it to Oxfordian - Albian stages (163 - 100 mya). The genus was formalized by Zhao Xijin in 1986.

The fragmentary condition of this single skeleton places doubt on the validity of this genus, some studies concluding it is a nomen dubium. Monkonosaurus was about five metres long. The ilium has a length of 905 millimetres. The sacrum consists of five sacral vertebrae. Zhao placed Monkonosaurus in the Oligosacralosauroidea.

Comencini started his political career in the Italian Social Movement (MSI), for which he was elected to the Regional Council of Veneto in 1985 and 1990. In the early 1990s, during his second term in the Council, he switched to Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord. In 1994 he was elected secretary of the party and in 1995 he was re-elected to the Council. During his tenure as leader, Lega Nord had its best electoral result so far in Veneto and in any other region, scoring 29.7% of the vote at the 1996 general election. In 1998 Comencini broke with Umberto Bossi in the name of Venetian nationalism as opposed to Padanian nationalism. Although he commanded a majority of Liga Veneta's regional councillors (7 out of 9: Ettore Beggiato, Alessio Morosin, Mariangelo Foggiato, Alberto Poir√®, Michele Munaretto, Franco Roccon and himself), Comencini was not supported by the majority of Liga Veneta who supported Gian Paolo Gobbo instead. He thus resigned as national secretary and formed a new party called Liga Veneta Repubblica (later Veneti d'Europa, Liga Fronte Veneto and finally, again, Liga Veneta Repubblica). Most recently, Comencini ran in the 2015 regional election for Independence We Veneto (in support of Luca Zaia's second term as President), but was not elected.

To control costs, he has the work done in the late Pussy's body shop, now run by his widow Angie. Phil demands repairs for non-existent defects. Tensions rise in New York. Little Carmine's yacht is holed, and sinks. His crew attempt to recruit Tony B through Angelo, his old prison buddy. Angelo and Rusty offer him \\"a chance to earn\\": in retaliation for Johnny's hit on Lorraine, \\"someone has to go\\". Tony B, knowing that Tony wants to keep his family out of New York hostilities, refuses. But he is short of money, and his young sons envy the Sopranos' standard of living. He agrees. His assigned target is Joey Peeps. Tony B finds him in his car outside a New York brothel where he has just collected a payment, and shoots him along with the girl, a prostitute, he is giving a lift to. Tony B's foot is injured when Peeps's car rolls over it, and he hobbles back to his own car. Carmela is planning a surprise party for her father Hugh De Angelis's 75th birthday. Nudged by her mother Mary, she tells Tony that, because of the separation, it would be better if he did not attend. Tony is taken aback, but consents. Mary does not want him there because she thinks his vulgar behavior will embarrass her in front of an old friend, Russ Fegoli, who will be attending with his wife. Mary has enormous respect for Fegoli, who had a modest career in the Foreign Service. Junior tells Hugh about the party, intentionally ruining the surprise. Hugh insists that the \\"man of the house\\" attend. Carmela reluctantly invites Tony at short notice. At the party, Mary is duly embarrassed by Tony's behaviour. Tony presents Hugh with a Beretta Giubileo shotgun, but Fegoli observes that the best ones are not exported. At the end of the evening, Tony roughly puts the now-devalued shotgun in the trunk of the car. As the Fegolis are leaving, Mary apologizes to them for Tony's conduct. Carmela is furious at her mother's snobbery, commending Tony for his gift to her father and his courtesy to the guests. As Artie leads the younger guests in a game of Marco Polo, Tony and A.J. grab Carmela and throw her into the pool. Eventually, Tony and Carmela find themselves alone. They kiss in the pool, and spend the night together. He leaves in the morning before she wakes.

This article is about the music of the region of Lazio excluding Rome, itself. For that, see Music of Rome.) Lazio is surrounded by music. Besides the province of Rome, the other provinces in the region of Latium are Frosinone, Latina, Rieti, and Viterbo. Generally speaking, the Lazio Symphony, which has its base in Rome, itself, \\"plays the provinces,\\" so to speak, and puts on regular concerts throughout Latium. Other than that, the provinces offer: *Frosinone: this is the historic region that recalls the presence of Cicero and Pope Boniface VIII.

Folk tradition Latium shares the ottava rima folk tradition with nearby Tuscany and Abruzzo. Ottava rima (also poeti contadini) is a kind of vocal music that can be competitive and improvised, thoughtful, articulate and political, and is sometimes based on the work of Ariosto, Dante and Homer. Latium is also home to the saltarello, a 4/4 dance that is most closely associated with Alta Sabina. The folk music of Latium was recorded as part of the Italian roots revival in the 1960s, by groups like Canzoniere del Lazio. References *Surian, Alessio. \\"Tenores and Tarantellas\\". 2000.

It was a herbivore that lived in what is now China. The type species is Yingshanosaurus jichuanensis. Discovery and naming In 1983, a stegosaurian skeleton was excavated in Sichuan by team led by Wan Jihou. In 1984, the find was reported by Zhou Shiwu. In 1985, Zhou used the name Yingshanosaurus jichuanensis during a paleontological congress in Toulouse. Though his lecture was published in 1986,S. Zhou, 1986, \\"De l'origine et de l'√©volution syst√©matique des Stegosauria √† la lumi√®re des fossiles connus\\", Les Dinosaures de La Chine √† La France, Colloque International de Pal√©ontologie, Toulouse, France, 2-6 Septembre 1985, Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle de Toulouse, Toulouse pp 31-38 it was assumed that the name remained a nomen nudum due to an insufficient description. In 1994 however, Zhu Songlin fully described the animal.Zhu Songlin, 1994, \\"ËÆ∞ÂõõÂ∑ùÁõÜÂú∞Ëê•Â±±Âéø‰∏ÄÂâëÈæôÂåñÁü≥ [Record of a fossil stegosaur from Yingshan in the Sichuan Basin]\\", Sichuan Cultural Relics, 1994(S1): 8-14 This fact escaped most Western researchers who considered the taxon invalid until well into the twenty-first century. The generic name is derived from the county of Yingshan. The specific name refers to the location of the site, Jichuan. The holotype, CV OO722, was found in a layer of the late Upper Shaximiao Formation, probably dating from the early Kimmeridgian. It consists of a partial skeleton including a fragmentary skull, of an adult individual. It contains a number of individual dorsal vertebrae, a series of dorsal vertebrae found in articulation with the sacrum and pelvis, seven tail vertebrae, ribs, seven chevrons, a left scapulocoracoid, a left humerus, a left radius, a left second metacarpal, a left thighbone, a left shinbone, a left fibula, metacarpals, a phalanx, several back plates and a left shoulder spine. The main lacking parts are the neck and the tail end. The skull bones found are so fragmentary that they provide little relevant information. A 2006 paper by Susannah Maidment states that the only fossil specimen could not be located. Description Like all stegosaurians, Yingshanosaurus was an herbivorous dinosaur. It was about four to five metres long. The thighbone has a length of 675 millimetres, the shinbone of forty-six centimetres. The humerus is forty centimetres long. Four vertebrae of the sacrum (S2-S5) were solidly fused to the ilia of the pelvis, the spaces between the sacral ribs being almost closed, reduced to oval depressions pierced from below by small openings, no more than a centimetre in cross-section. The neural arches are of medium height. The neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae are plate-like in side view and have a transversely expanded top. Yingshanosaurus had a pair of about eighty centimetres long wing-like spines on its shoulders, similar in shape and relative size to those of Gigantspinosaurus. The shoulder spine has a large flat trapezoidal base; after a sudden kink, a more narrow straight shaft, flat but with a protruding ridge on the outer side, projects to behind from the lower base edge. The bony plates on its back were rather small and relatively low, triangular or fin-shaped. The largest plates, about fifteen centimetres high and with a base length of twenty centimetres, are similar in profile to those of Hesperosaurus, though of a more reduced relative size. They were not \\"splates\\", i.e. featuring a thickened middle section, but almost uniformly flat, with a rough and veined surface. Phylogeny Zhu placed Yingshanosaurus, within the Stegosauridae, in the Stegosaurinae.

The parish, which includes the villages of Hunstrete and Stanton Prior, has a population of 397.  History  Stantonbury Camp is the site of an Iron Age hillfort near Stanton Prior. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The hillfort, which is at the top of an isolated outcrop of Oolitic Limestone, close to the A39 road is on the route of the Wansdyke. In 926 √Üthelstan gave the manor, then spelled Merkesburie, to his son. It was later gifted to Glastonbury Abbey and in one of the Danelaw wars was taken by Danish troops. It was restored to the abbey again after the victory of Edgar the Peaceful. Marksbury was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Mercesberia. The name of the village is thought to come from Old English either as ‚ÄòM«£rec‚Äôs or Mearc‚Äôs stronghold‚Äô (from an Old English male personal name + burh ‚Äòstronghold‚Äô, ‚Äòfortified place‚Äô, dative byrig), or as ‚Äòstronghold on a boundary‚Äô (from mearc ‚Äòboundary‚Äô, possibly a reference to the Wansdyke, + burh, byrig). The parish of Marksbury was part of the Keynsham Hundred, The village has a primary school.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. Marksbury is part of the Farmborough Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census, the Farmborough Ward (which includes Compton Dando, Woollard, Hunstrete, Chewton Keynsham, Saltford and Stanton Prior) had 1,111 residents, living in 428 households, with an average age of 44.5 years. Of these 71% of residents describing their health as 'good', 21% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.0% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 22,100 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Church  The Church of St Peter, is an ancient structure, with a tower containing six bells. It is believed to be late 12th century in origin but mainly from the 15th century. The tower has three stages; the first stage has diagonal buttresses, a canted stair turret in the return of tower and nave and a very small west door with a canted flat arch under a 2-light, chamfered mullion window dated 1634. The second stage has a cusped 2-light window with heavy louvres to the north, a blocked single light to the east and 2-light chamfered, vaguely pointed windows south and west, contemporary with third stage which has one enormous, round headed window with raised architrave and louvres per side, thin, embattled parapet dominated by four pyramidal pinnacles with vanes. The nave has two 2-light windows under hoodmoulds flanking a blocked, moulded round- headed door under a plaque dated 1627. The buttressed, off-centre chancel has to north one window as elsewhere, 3-light east window of 1875. There are several monuments in the chancel including those to Counsell, 1671, and Wadden, 1682. In the nave is a monument to Boulter 1782, by Brewer of Box. Reverend William Counsell was the rector (1662‚Äì74). The church is a Grade II* listed building. An unidentified monument in the churchyard is also listed. On Wingsbury Hill are remains of an ancient chapel, probably belonging to a monastery, which formerly existed here.

The music of Genoa includes a number of important musical venues. Genoa, a major port, is the capital of the region of Liguria and in the 19th century aspired to recognition as a cultural center more in keeping with its role as a major city in the history of the Risorgimento, the political, social, and military movement that eventually led to the unification of the modern nation state of Italy. Venues The Teatro Carlo Felice was built in 1828 and named for the monarch of the then kingdom of Sardinia (which included the present regions of Sardinia, Piedmont, Savoy, and Liguria). The theater was the center of music and social life in the 1800s. On various occasions in the history of the theatre, presentations have been conducted by Mascagni, Richard Strauss, Hindemith and Stravinsky.

One of the warning signs prohibiting swimming or wading in Emerald Pool Emerald Pool at flood stage, May 2006 Silver Apron at flood stage, May 2006 Yosemite Emerald Pool is a small, shallow lake, with an area of less than one acre. It is located about 80 meters above Vernal Fall in Yosemite National Park. It is named for its deep green color, which is caused by algae living on the rocks at the bottom of the pool. In the summertime during diminished water flow, the Silver Apron (a smooth granite slope over which the Merced River flows into the Emerald Pool) is frequently (albeit illegally) used by hikers as a water slide. Swimming or wading in the Emerald Pool or entering the Silver Apron is prohibited by the National Park Service since waders or swimmers have been swept over Vernal Fall and killed, and people sliding down Silver Apron risk collision with hidden rocks at its lower end. This prohibition is clearly marked with signs. Yuba River There also is an Emerald Pools destination in California along the Yuba River. The South Yuba River flows down a waterfall into a sheer rock canyon with two pools. The walls around the first pool measure from around to in height with a length of around and width of around . The crystal-clear water is deep, near the middle of the pool, and many people jump off the cliffs for enjoyment. A second pool nearby is nearly as large. Despite the cool water temperature it is a popular swimming spot, particularly among young adults. Yellowstone National Park Emerald Pool, a hot spring named for its emerald green color, is one of the main attractions at Black Sand Basin in Yellowstone National Park. Its temperature is 154.6 ¬∞F and its dimensions are 27x38 feet with a depth of 25 feet. The color is due to growth of yellow bacteria and algae. Cooling, the result of objects thrown into the pool and natural debris, has affected the growth of the bacteria and algae, making the pool appear orange and brown around the edges.Geysers - Black Sand, Yellowstone National Park Others Other locations named Emerald Pool are in Morne Trois Pitons National Park in Dominica, and in Zion National Park in Utah.

Prior to that, he was Minister of Agriculture in Silvio Berlusconi's fourth cabinet from May 2008 to April 2010 and Vice President of Veneto from 2005 to 2008.  Political career  Luca Zaia joined Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord in the early 1990s, after having met Gian Paolo Gobbo, and was first elected to public office in 1993, when he became municipal councillor of Godega di Sant'Urbano. Two years later, in 1995, he successfully ran for provincial councillor and, after the election, was appointed provincial minister of Agriculture.http://www.regione.veneto.it/static/www/giunta/Presidente/BiografiadiLUCAZAIA.pdf In the 1998 provincial election, Zaia was elected President of the Province of Treviso with 60.0% of the vote in the second round, after arriving ahead in the first round with 41.4% and refusing to accept the support of any other party other than his own. At the time, he was the youngest provincial president of Italy. In 2002 he was re-elected with a landslide 68.9% of the vote in the second round and continued to govern the province with the sole support of his party. In May 2005, Zaia was appointed Vice President of Veneto and regional minister of Agriculture and Tourism in Galan III Government, but left in May 2008 in order to take office as federal Minister of Agriculture in Berlusconi IV Cabinet. In December 2009, The People of Freedom (PdL) determined that the coalition candidate in the 2010 regional election would be a member of Lega Nord. Subsequently, the national council of Liga Veneta (LV) nominated Zaia for President of the region. President of Veneto In March 2010, Zaia was elected President of Veneto in a landslide, winning 60.2% of the vote against 29.1% of his foremost opponent, Giuseppe Bortolussi of the Democratic Party (PD). The election was a triumph for the LV, which was by far the largest party in the region with 35.2% of the vote, up from 14.7% of five years before, and won 20 seats in the Regional Council, up from 11. Zaia also gained the highest proportion of votes for President of Veneto since direct election was introduced in 1995. In 2012, Zaia polled as the most popular regional president in Italy. In May 2015 Zaia was re-elected President of Veneto with 50.1% of the vote in the 2015 regional election. In September 2020 Luca Zaia was re-elected President of Veneto with 76.8% of the vote becoming the most voted regional President ever in Italy. Social issues In early times of his administration, Zaia tried to limit the abortive pill RU-486. However, the AIFA (\\"Italian Agency of Medicine\\") declared that his position was unconstitutional in view of how the question is regulated by the Law 194 of 1978. In 2011, during the abrogative referendums, he voted \\"4 Yes\\". He called for more transparency and demanded more citizens' supervision of public administration. In 2013, Zaia spoke against the LGBT adoption, saying: \\"I have nothing against gays, but the possibility of adoption seems to me to be an extreme measure with unpredictable effects.\\"(\\"Io non ho nulla contro i gay, ma la possibilit√† dell‚Äôadozione mi pare un‚Äôestremizzazione dagli effetti imprevedibili\\"). Economic issues In August 2010, an anti-globalization group demonstrated in Vivaro against the planting of genetically modified organisms. The demonstration was supported by Zaia, who demanded a \\"return to legality\\", even though his predecessor Giancarlo Galan, a member of his coalition, was in favour of GMOs. After a flood in 2010, Zaia and his coalition changed a regional law to permit the reconstruction of rural ruins up to 800 cubic metres. The Democratic Party claimed that this was an attempt at \\"cementification\\". The National Association of Building Constructors (\\"Associazione nazionale costruttori edili\\", ANCE) also called the law a \\"bad choice\\". Zaia was criticized when, after the flood, he asked for more funds for the reconstruction, saying, \\"It's a shame spending ‚Ç¨250,000,000 for four stones in Pompei.\\" Venetian independence In March 2014, Zaia supported the plebiscite on Venetian independence. Zaia has compared the status of the Veneto within Italy to that of Crimea within Ukraine, which voted to secede from Ukraine following a plebiscite. 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus outbreak controversy In February 2020, Zaia apologized after criticizing China over the Coronavirus outbreak and claiming that Chinese people \\"eat live mice\\". Zaia has anyway emerged strengthened from the crisis, widely praised for keeping hospital admissions down, in contrast with the neighbouring region of Lombardy. Personal life Luca Zaia was born on 27 March 1968 in the Province of Treviso. In 1993, he received a degree in the science of animal production at the veterinary college of the University of Udine before attending a managerial course. In 1998, Zaia married Raffaella Monti. The couple has no children. In August 2006, when was Vice President of Veneto, Zaia saved an Albanian citizen who was wedged in a burning car. He refused the title of \\"hero\\".

Surrounding area Toshiba owns the land beneath the station and the surrounding portion of the Tsurumi Line, and JR East operates both under a long-term lease. Because of the surrounding scenery, and its status as \\"the station which you can never leave\\", Umi-Shibaura has been featured in several books and television programs and has gained some popularity as a day-trip destination.

Originally named the Triton Times, it is published once a week during the regular academic year, usually Mondays. Although The Guardian is officially a university department, it is funded solely by advertising. Unlike many college newspapers, The Guardian has no faculty advisor and is not formally tied to any academic program.  Staff structure  The Guardian's editorial staff consists of UCSD undergraduates. The Editor in Chief is elected in the late spring by a vote of the current year's staff; the Editor in Chief-elect then selects new senior editors, who make up the paper's Executive Board, which is ratified by the outgoing editors. In contrast, the paper's business side is operated by several longtime university employees. A Business Oversight Board, which includes the paper's general manager, Editor in Chief, and managing editors, is responsible for setting long-term policies for the business and overseeing their implementation.  University relationship  Though The Guardian is technically a self- supporting enterprise under the university's Student Affairs department, it operates with complete independence and autonomy from the university. Under the paper's constitution, the Executive Board operates as the sole publisher of the paper. The newspaper's student editors have formally resolved to cease its production and operations in the case of any university interference.  Recent history  In recent years, the paper has undergone a series of crises and resulting restructurings. Between 2001 and 2004, The Guardian saw its annual revenue plunge, from above $400,000 to less than $320,000. The resulting budget deficits nearly wiped out the paper's financial reserves and resulted in page reductions for its editorial operations. As part of an effort to stop the bleeding, the paper's general manager implemented a strict 50-50 division between editorial content and advertising. The Executive Board of the paper responded to the crisis by carrying out a reorganization of the business department and a reduction in the compensation of its student staff.  Editorial success  Throughout the years, The Guardian has won many local, regional, statewide, and national awards. In 2006, The Guardian won nearly a dozen and a half awards from the California College Media Association, in categories ranging from design and illustration to writing and photography. Shortly after, the paper was also named an honorable mention in the competition to be named Newspaper of the Year by the Associated Collegiate Press. In 2020, The Guardian won several awards from the San Diego Society of Professional Journalists, including second place for Best College Newspaper, first place for Best Arts & Entertainment Story in a College Publication, and second place for Best Column in a College Publication.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wfRN9CQNiacMehgmMTbiy9Ya1sY7eWde/view While UCSD does not have a journalism program, many former Guardian writers and editors have launched journalism careers. The Guardian alumni have worked or currently work for major newspapers (including The Wall Street Journal, the Orange County Register, Kansas City Star, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, The San Diego Union-Tribune, the Riverside Press-Enterprise, The Torrance Daily Breeze, The Christian Science Monitor, Investors Business Daily, LA Weekly, SF Weekly and the Los Angeles Times), magazines (including Newsweek, Vanity Fair, Flaunt and Macworld), and television news stations (KGTV-San Diego). In 2006, an alumnus was nominated for the Academy Award in the Documentary Short category.documentary film  Change in frequency  During fall quarter 1990, The Guardian published three issues a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Due to a lack of advertising revenue and the increased production and distribution costs of a third issue of the newspaper, the paper reverted to a twice-weekly schedule during winter quarter 1991. The Guardian was published twice weekly, on Mondays and Thursdays, until winter quarter 2017, when the switch to a weekly schedule was made. At the beginning of spring quarter 2020, The Guardian temporarily ceased its print publication and made the transition to release all content on its website and in a weekly newsletter. This change was made due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state could not limit pharmacists‚Äô right to provide information about prescription drug prices.Va. State Pharmacy Bd. v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, . This was an important case in determining the application of the First Amendment to commercial speech.  Background  The Commonwealth of Virginia had a statute which prohibited pharmacists from advertising prescription drug prices, providing that those who did would be guilty of ‚Äúunprofessional conduct‚Äù. Drug prices varied throughout the state, as the District Court found. The law was challenged by an individual consumer and consumer groups, who brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Public Citizen's Litigation Group argued and won the case before the Supreme Court.  Majority opinion  Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority, began his opinion by giving a brief overview of the Virginia pharmacy regulation statutes, and then distinguished previous challenges to such regulations, explaining that such previous cases had been based on economic due process under the Fourteenth Amendment rather than on free speech grounds. Blackmun reasoned that this case concerned not only commercial regulation, but the free flow of information. This case was just as much about the consumers‚Äô right to receive information as it was about the pharmacists‚Äô right to provide it, and that the right to free speech is just as much about the ‚Äúlistener‚Äù as it is about the ‚Äúspeaker‚Äù.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 753-54. Justice Blackmun, the author of Court's opinion. Blackmun further described how the court had whittled down the ‚Äúcommercial speech‚Äù exemption through past precedent; for example, Bigelow v. Virginia,. in which the Court struck down a Virginia statute prohibiting the advertisement of out-of-state abortion procedures.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 759. He also distinguished commercial speech from such ‚Äúunprotected‚Äù categories of speech such as ‚Äúfighting words‚Äù and obscenity. Nor does having a purely economic interest in the content of speech deprive the speaker or listener of the protection of the First Amendment. This is especially true for the consumers in this case, as the poor, elderly, and infirm needed access to such information to make informed decisions about how to get their prescriptions filled inexpensively. For such people in need, Blackmun reasoned, such information was more than simply a convenience. Furthermore, he stressed the importance of price advertising in a free market economy, because they serve to provide the underlying information for citizens to make private economic decisions.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 765. The Commonwealth of Virginia justified its enactment of the regulation on the grounds of maintaining the professionalism of pharmacists, asserting that aggressive price competition among pharmacists would make it difficult for pharmacists to provide the proper professional services. Blackmun responded that while regulation of the pharmacy profession was both necessary and within the prerogative of the several States through their police power, the statute promoted consumers‚Äô ignorance, effectively keeping them in the dark about prescription drug prices. Blackmun dismissed this rationale as paternalistic, saying that if consumers had sufficient access to information regarding drug pricing and availability, it would only serve to aid them in their decisions about choosing a prescription drug supplier.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 770. Blackmun concluded his opinion by explaining that states still retained the power to regulate some commercial speech, via content-neutral time, place, and manner regulations. Likewise, states retain the power to prohibit false or deceptive advertisements. However, he held that the states could not suppress truthful information about a lawful economic activity, simply out of fear of potential consequences.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 771-73.  Burger's concurrence  Chief Justice Burger concurred on largely practical grounds, citing the fact that since 95% of the prescriptions being filled required prepackaged medications, prepared by their manufacturers to be sold immediately. These drugs had a large enough market to be sold in such a manner, so the state‚Äôs justification based on professionalism carried little weight. Burger instead concentrated on limiting the scope of Blackmun‚Äôs majority opinion, stating that it did not extend to professional services such as medicine or law. Burger reasoned that since regulation of these professions governed a different set of risks, and since the services involved were unique and personalized to the client, the holding of this case should not apply to them.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 773-74 (Burger, C.J., concurring).  Stewart's concurrence  Justice Stewart wrote a concurrence explaining how the holding of this did not limit the states‚Äô ability to restrict deceptive or false advertising. He cited various libel cases to demonstrate that while the press cannot be harshly restricted for fear that journalists may occasionally get their facts wrong, an advertiser is much more likely to know whether or not the material he was publishing was true. Thus, states should have greater latitude in regulating the content of advertisements for the veracity of their content. Even though commercial advertising and ideological expression are clearly different, advertisements which convey truthful information are worthy of First Amendment protection, and the elimination of deceptive claims serves to further the goal of the free flow of accurate and reliable information.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 774-81 (Stewart, J., concurring).  Rehnquist's dissent  Justice Rehnquist, the author of the dissenting opinion. Justice Rehnquist was the lone dissenter in this case. He lamented the majority‚Äôs decision to elevate the advertisement of products to the level of the ideological ‚Äúmarketplace of ideas‚Äù, feeling that this was an overextension of First Amendment doctrine. He used a type of slippery slope argument to describe the potential consequences of this decision; specifically, he worried that this ruling would allow the promotion of consumption of liquor, cigarettes, and other products which states had traditionally tried to discourage.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 781 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). He indirectly hearkened back to the Lochner era economic due process cases, accusing the court of writing its own economic policy into the law, when such a regulation should be within the police power of the state. He pointed to the potentially misleading nature of commercial speech, and suggested that consumers who truly needed such information could easily seek it out themselves. He concluded by arguing that the majority has not only failed to accord proper weight to the judgment of the Virginia State Legislature, but that the protection of the First Amendment ought to be limited to political and social issues.Va. State Pharmacy Bd., 425 U.S. at 784-90 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).

The show was so popular that a magazine about it was published in 1989. Format Produced by Dixie Duncan and directed by Spencer Wilson, Ray McKenna and Bob Loxton, the Early Bird Show was hosted by Australian rock singer Darryl Cotton Marie Van Maaren and Marty The Monster. The Early Bird Show, an extremely popular family and children's variety show, was a live, five-hour production on air from 7am - 12pm every Saturday. The show included many popular regulars including, Roy Hampson ( Good Morning Melbourne co-Host with Annette Allison) as the 'professor' Liane Scurrah-Jonas VFL/AFL injury prevention fitness trainer, Author, breakfast announcer& talkback radio, Pilates and Aerobics trainer) 'fun & fitness', Simon 'pancake breakfasts', Frits Maaten (Animal nature park owner) and his animals, Rosemary (Dance School owner and teacher) and her EBS dancers, Colin Beaumont, (entertainer & Musician) remote control car segment, puppets Mr and Mrs Timms. Many big names in music, TV, radio and sport appeared regularly to take a part of the fun and games. In 1989, the show was shortened to two hours and renamed Club 10. This version lasted ten weeks before being replaced with Video Hits, a music video show. The Early Bird Show was forward thinking Creation for families by Dixie Duncan which is still remembered with such enthusiasm today. It gave the chance for many children to express their talents or just be a part of a TV family. It was a platform where those who were regulars could support many charities. The Early Bird Show lives on in the memories of all those who either watched or was a part of it. Incident A 1987 episode featured Rags the Kangaroo beating up Marty the Monster. It garnered international attention outside of Australia. Other versions An earlier version of the show had aired from 1977 until 1980. Shown on weekday mornings, The Early Bird Show featured hosts Mike McCarthy and Marie Van Maaren. The show was replaced in 1981 by the long- running Good Morning Australia (breakfast TV). A similar, but unrelated, show named Early Birds was broadcast by SAS10 in Adelaide in the early 1970s. The show was hosted by Veronica Overton and Fat Cat. \\"Early Birds\\" was a mix of cartoons, competitions and music clips. During one telecast, Overton resigned on camera, saying \\"Goodbye children. Fat Cat will be back on Monday, but I won't\\". Occasional stand-in, DiDi James, took over the show for a short while and later Jane Reilly became host. TVW 7 Perth (TVW Enterprises owned TVW 7 Perth and SAS 10 Adelaide in the 70s) also had a very popular Earlybirds show in the 1970s and 1980s from 7 to 9 am. It featured Fat Cat and another character Percy Penguin, plus puppets, Wilbur Worm, who had a sarcastic streak, in the early days, and Sunny Sandgroper, who always told appalling jokes. There were two hosts, one male and one female, and those who appeared over the years on the Perth version were Keith Geary, Ian Teasdale, Sandy Baker (n√©e Palmer), Carolyn Noble, Sharon Dale, Peter Dean, Ann Sanders and others. It was made at TVW Tuart Hill Studios and often presented outdoor broadcasts at shopping centers and other establishments. It ran mainly during each school holiday initially and then each weekday toward the end, when networking pushed it out of the schedules in favour of Agro's Cartoon Connection and ultimately new shows. TVW did a Saturday version of Earlybirds, calling it Fat Cat's Funtime Show. It ran throughout the late 1970s and 80s years until Saturday Disney brought about its demise. In New Zealand, TV3 have also alternated and created their very own version of the show which went from 1989 to 1992. It originally aired on weekday mornings from 7:00am to 9:00am before shifting to weekend mornings (same timeslot). Also known as E.B.S., it was presented by Suzy Cato and a puppet character named Russell Rooster along with another puppet character, Aunty Kiri Kea and her family of Rubber Ducks. This version of the show contains a few different segments which include local skits, competitions, games, interviews, jokes with Kiri and the Rubber Ducks, how to draw cartoon monsters with Mark, cooking with Annabel Langbein, Hollywood gossip with David Hartnell and also a variety of cartoons from overseas such as The Super Mario Brothers Super Show, The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, Beetlejuice, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Garfield and Friends, Kissyfur, Super Friends, Dinosaucers, Camp Candy, Dennis the Menace, Voltron: Defender of the Universe, The Real Ghostbusters (as well as its spin-off Slimer! And the Real Ghostbusters), The Wuzzles, Sylvanian Families and DuckTales. Cato later went on to host other television programmes such as Suzy's World, 3pm and You and Me. She then later ran a company called Treehut Productions which produces shows dedicating to share \\"Blue Light\\" safety messages.

Chevy Chase and Demi Moore star as yuppies who are taken to court for speeding in the bizarre, financially bankrupt small town of Valkenvania. Dan Aykroyd co-stars as the town's 106-year-old judge, Alvin Valkenheiser, who holds a personal grudge against financiers, and John Candy has a supporting role as Valkenheiser's grandson, chief of police Dennis Valkenheiser. The film's tone was compared by critics to films such as Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, as well as The Munsters. The film's humor was described as being derived from sketch comedy and gross-out humor. Production commenced in 1990 under the title Git, which was changed in production to Valkenvania. Subsequently, prior to the film's release, Warner Bros. changed the title to Nothing but Trouble; in a press statement released in December 1990, director Dan Aykroyd said that he preferred the title Valkenvania. The film was noted for its strongly negative reception, with criticism directed at its humor, screenplay, tone, and direction. Aykroyd would go on to receive a Worst Supporting Actor Razzie at the 12th Golden Raspberry Awards.  Plot  While hosting a party in his Manhattan penthouse, financial publisher Chris Thorne (Chevy Chase) meets lawyer Diane Lightson (Demi Moore) and agrees to escort her to consult a client in Atlantic City on the following day. Thorne's clients, obnoxious but wealthy Brazilian siblings Fausto and Renalda Squiriniszu (Taylor Negron and Bertila Damas), meet up with them and invite themselves along. Chris takes a detour off of the New Jersey Turnpike, ultimately ending up in the run-down village of Valkenvania. After running a stop sign and subsequently attempting to escape pursuing officer Dennis Valkenheiser (John Candy), the group is captured and taken before Dennis's 106-year-old grandfather Judge Alvin Valkenheiser (Dan Aykroyd). After Chris offends the judge, the yuppies are locked in a hidden room under the courthouse to be judged the next day, and they overhear the judge violently executing a group of convicted drug dealers in a deadly roller coaster nicknamed \\"Mr. Bonestripper\\". Chris, Diane and the Brazilians attend the judge's dinner, learning that the Judge is holding them there out of revenge for a coal deal which the Valkenheiser family blames for their poverty. The group attempts an escape, but Chris and Diane are captured by Alvin's mute granddaughter Eldona (Candy, in a dual role). Meanwhile, being chased by Dennis' trigger-happy cousin, Miss Purdah, the Brazilians escape by cutting a deal with Dennis, who decides to escape with them. The Judge holds Chris and Diane hostage, but they eventually escape, get lost through hidden hallways and slides and become separated. Diane makes it out of the house and into the property's salvage yard; here, she meets two troll-like creatures by the names of Bobo (played by Aykroyd) and Lil' Debbull (played by John Daveikis), the judge's severely deformed grandchildren. Earning the creatures' friendship, Diane catches glimpses of Eldona destroying Chris's BMW 733i. Chris sneaks into the Judge's personal quarters but is quickly caught. Valkenheiser punishes him according to house policy, which decrees that Chris must marry Eldona. Meanwhile, in the court room, Digital Underground is being held on charges of speeding, but the Judge releases them after being charmed by an impromptu rap performance. He also asks them to stay as witnesses for the wedding, which Chris reluctantly goes through with in exchange for his life, but is later caught pleading the band to help him escape. The band leaves without understanding him, and a furious Alvin sentences Chris to die in \\"Mr. Bonestripper\\". The machine breaks down the instant before Chris is fed into it, and he escapes. The Judge nearly kills Diane with another claw contraption, but Chris retrieves her at the last second and the two jump on a freight train back to New York. After the two report their plight to the authorities, the Judge's courthouse is raided by local and state police. Chris and Diane are asked to accompany the officers to the site, only to find out that the officers involved are fully aware of and in league with the Judge. The couple escapes when the area's underground coal fires cause a collapse, destroying the town. Chris and Diane return to New York, but Chris sees the judge on television, brandishing Chris's driver's license, announcing that he and his family plan to move in with his new grandson-in-law in New York causing Chris to comically flee for his life.  Cast   Style and interpretation  Entertainment Weekly, Vibe and Den of Geek described the film as a horror comedy. The Los Angeles Times critic Peter Rainer wrote, \\"The intention seems to be a slap-happy cross between Psycho and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\\". Lou Cedrone, writing for the Baltimore Sun, said that the film \\"plays like a comedy version of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films.\\" Candice Russel, writing for the Sun-Sentinel, called Nothing but Trouble a \\"variation on The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\". The film's humor was described by critics as deriving from gross-out humor and sketch comedy. Nathan Rabin interpreted the film's plot as \\"[tapping] into a fear common among wealthy Manhattan yuppies: that once they leave the cozy confines of the five boroughs, inbred hillbillies will try to kill them for being wealthy Manhattan yuppies.\\" Production The film marked comedian, writer and actor Dan Aykroyd's debut as a director. The story was developed after a screening of the 1987 film Hellraiser that producer Robert K. Weiss attended with Dan and Peter Aykroyd. Weiss had a fractured rib and suggested the three attend a film to take his mind off his injury, but that it couldn't be a comedy because it hurt him to laugh, which is why the Aykroyd brothers chose a horror film. Once the movie started and the three saw the audience laughing at the film, Weiss suggested that they make a horror-comedy together, since audiences wanted to laugh and be scared at the same time. Peter Aykroyd related an event in which Dan had been pulled over for speeding in upstate New York and was taken to the justice of the peace to stand trial in what Dan referred to as a \\"kangaroo court\\", and after he was fined $50, the justice of the peace invited Dan to stay for tea, and he ended up staying there for four hours. It was suggested that a horror story be developed based on this event, and Aykroyd spent 6 months writing it as a screenplay titled Git, which was later changed to Road to Ruin; Dan Aykroyd described the script as \\"a monster movie\\" and compared it to Beetlejuice and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Much of the script's bizarre characters and events, such as the giant mutant babies, were based on a series of dreams Aykroyd was having, and he set the story in the fictional town of Valkenvania, which was based loosely on the town of Centralia, Pennsylvania. Aykroyd offered the script to John Hughes, who was interested in the story, but ultimately turned it down because he only directed his own scripts. John Landis disliked the script and immediately turned it down. The script caught the attention of Warner Bros., who wanted John Candy to costar. Aykroyd wanted to play the parts of Judge Valkenheiser and Chris Thorne, but the studio wanted Chevy Chase to play Thorne, and Aykroyd agreed. With no director attached, Aykroyd said he would direct the film to secure the deal, even though he didn't want to direct the film. Aykroyd later agreed to play the giant adult baby Bobo as well, after no one else wanted to play the part, and found it stressful to play two parts in heavy makeup while simultaneously directing and producing. Warner Bros. had faith in Aykroyd, and gave him a $40 million budget. The film commenced production on May 7, 1990 in Los Angeles, California, under the title Trickhouse. On July 12, the title was changed to Valkenvania, and a release date was scheduled for Christmas 1990.Starlog #161, December 1990, p. 9 The \\"Valkenheiser\\" mansion, Town Hall, and other environments were constructed on two soundstages at Warner Bros. Studios; one of the set pieces, dubbed \\"Autohenge\\", was a garden constructed of scrap metal. Designer William Sandell was inspired by his previous experience as a kinetic sculptor. The production designers acquired props and decorations from ‚Äúevery prop resource in town,‚Äù as well as Aykroyd's personal collection. The Greystone Mansion in Los Angeles was used to shoot the scenes depicting Chris Thorne's New York City apartment. Exteriors were also shot in the Lehigh Valley, 60 miles North of Philadelphia; second-unit photography occurred in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York City. During filming, Chevy Chase was demeaning or verbally abrasive to members of the cast and crew, telling Demi Moore that her costume was too revealing and yelled at Aykroyd, saying that he had more worth than Aykroyd because Chase's paycheck was higher than Aykroyd's, despite him being the director. The film went $5 million over budget.  Soundtrack  Nothing but Trouble (Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released in 1991 through Warner Bros. Records. It is composed of ten songs. ;Other songs There are four additional songs that appeared in the film but were not released on the soundtrack album: *\\"A Garden in the Rain\\" performed by Blue Barron *\\"She's a Great, Great Girl\\" performed by Jack Teagarden *\\"Wabash Cannonball\\" performed by Doc Watson *\\"Helen Claire\\" performed by Michael Kamen  Release  In December 1990, Warner Bros. changed the film's title to Nothing but Trouble. On December 20, Dan Aykroyd stated in a press release that he would always think of the film as Valkenvania. A promotional illustration by Boris Vallejo was commissioned in 1991. The film's release was delayed to recut the film for a PG-13 rating, removing the film's over the top violence, and the studio rescheduled The Bonfire of the Vanities to the Christmas 1990 release date originally held by Nothing but Trouble. The film was released on February 15, 1991. According to Box Office Mojo, the film opened at #8 in 1,671 theaters, grossing $3,966,240 opening weekend. The site lists its total gross upon completed release as $8,479,793, with a 50.5% drop-off in its second week of release. In 1992, at the 12th Golden Raspberry Awards, Aykroyd received a Worst Supporting Actor Razzie. It also took home Worst Picture at the 1991 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. Chevy Chase later expressed dislike for the film, saying he only accepted the role of Chris Thorne because of his friendship with Aykroyd.Fruchter, Rena. I'm Chevy Chase and You're Not. London: Virgin Books Ltd., 2007, p. 158. Critical reception Nothing but Trouble' was poorly reviewed by critics. Chris Hicks, writing for the Deseret News wrote, 'though Aykroyd seems to be having the time of his life as the judge, Chase, Candy, and Moore appear much less animated than usual [and] downright embarrassed in some scenes'. Writing for The New York Times, Vincent Canby criticized Aykroyd's script, believing its narrative had 'loose ends', and said 'the movie looks less funny than expensive'. The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film's comedy, considering it to be 'skit-level'. The Los Angeles Times critic Peter Rainer wrote, 'if you're in the mood to be clobbered with stale jokes, it might seem fitfully amusing. Occasionally, the talents of the cast burn through the haze of misfires and remembered routines'. Lou Cedrone, writing for the Baltimore Sun, said that 'if there is a laugh here, it goes by unnoticed'. http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-02-19/features/1991050149_1_dan-aykroyd- texas-chainsaw-chainsaw-massacre Chicago Tribune critic Dave Kehr wrote that \\"Valkenvania bids fair to become one of the legendary disasters of the movie business, a movie so unfunny, so distasteful and so painful to watch that you can't take your eyes off it'. Jay Boyar, writing for the Orlando Sentinel wrote: 'The problem is that the neophyte director appears to believe that being gross, in itself, is enough. Even John Waters, in his Pink Flamingos period, realized that wit was also necessary. Besides, Waters was genuinely outrageous in a startlingly original way. The grotesquerie of Aykroyd's film reminded me of a disturbed child trying to gross out a friend on the playground.' Candice Russel, writing for the Sun-Sentinel, wrote that 'this mean-spirited effort by Aykroyd proves that he cannot write an effective comedy; if he's acting, he should leave the direction to someone else'. Washington Post writer Hal Hinson called the film 'nothing but trouble and agony and pain and suffering and obnoxious, toxically unfunny bad taste; it's nothing but miserable'. Entertainment Weekly critic Michael Sauter wrote: '[Aykroyd and Candy] generate approximately four laughs. Chase adds maybe two. In movie-ticket terms, that‚Äôs less than one laugh per dollar; as a video rental, it‚Äôs a slightly better deal.' The same publication printed a second review by Owen Gleiberman, writing: 'Most of the jokes are so lame that Chevy Chase can‚Äôt even be bothered to look nonchalant. A sadder excuse for a movie would be hard to imagine.' Writing for People, Ralph Novak wrote that 'after a few minutes, it‚Äôs clear that this comedy is not enigmatic‚Äîjust hopelessly confused'. Empire writer Jo Berry wrote: 'Unfortunately this isn't even half as fun as the shortest bumper-car ride, with the cast lost in a sea of unfunny situations and badly executed antique jokes on loan from The Munsters all obviously puzzled about why they are actually there.' A staff review in Variety opined, 'it's a good bet a film is in trouble when the highlight comes from seeing John Candy in drag'; while TV Guide stated, 'Aykroyd's film has a relentless imbecility that allows it to stand with films such as Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla, John Goldfarb Please Come Home and Which Way to the Front? as one of the worst attempts at comedy ever filmed'. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 5% based on reviews from 22 critics. The site's consensus states: 'There's nothing good in Nothing But Trouble, a grotesque comedy that is more likely to make audiences ill than make them laugh'. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"D+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Nathan Rabin, in his My Year of Flops segment for The A.V. Club, wrote: 'Aykroyd here has lovingly, meticulously created a hideous, grotesque nightmare world nobody in their right mind would want to visit the first time around, let alone return to.'Rabin, Nathan. My Year of Flops. New York: AV Club., 2007 IGN named Nothing but Trouble as Dan Aykroyd's worst film. The film has also received praise, with Complex listing Nothing but Trouble as one of \\"25 Underrated 90s Comedies\\"; staff writer Matt Barone called it 'a strangely magnetic cluster-fuck of a high-concept comedy'. IFC listed Nothing but Trouble as one of \\"10 '90s Comedies That Really Need Sequels\\".

It promotes the rediscovery of the Republic of Venice's heritage, traditions, culture, and language, and demanding more autonomy or even independence from Italy for Veneto. According to journalist Paolo Possamai, Venetism is \\"the strain of Veneto and Venetians toward the recognition of their identity and autonomy\\".Francesco Jori, Dalla ≈Åiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti, Marsilio, Venice 2009, p. 98 Venetism is a broad movement, which definitely includes Venetist parties, notably Liga Veneta, but also encompasses people from all the political parties. In 1982 Goffredo Parise, a writer and journalist, wrote: \\"Veneto is my fatherland. [...] Even if a Republic of Italy exists, this abstract idea is not my Fatherland [...]. We Venetians have travelled throughout the world, but our Fatherland, that for which we would fight if it were necessary to fight, is Veneto. [...] When I see \\"River sacred to the Fatherland\\" written on the bridges spanning the Piave, I am moved, not because I think of Italy, but rather because I think of Veneto.Goffredo Parise, Corriere della Sera, 7 February 1982http://www.raixevenete.com/il-veneto-e-la-mia-patria Most Venetists consider Veneto a nation distinct from Italy and often refuse the validity of the result of the referendum with which Veneto (or, better, Venetia, see below) was united with Italy in 1866. Some, as the members of the Venetian National Party/Veneto State and those of Venetian Independence, have long proposed a re-edition of that referendum and campaign for the independence of Venetia, a country that would be composed of all the territories of the historical Venetian Republic, covering current Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, large chunks of Lombardy (the provinces of Brescia and Bergamo, the area around Crema and a portion of the province of Mantua), and Trentino, which was never fully part of the Republic of Venice, but is broadly culturally Venetian. The proposal, regarding to Veneto alone, has more recently gained the support of Liga Veneta, the Government of Veneto, and the majority of the Regional Council of Veneto, which endorsed a bill aimed at organising the referendum in 2014. The Constitutional Court ruled that referendum out as contrary to the Constitution, but authorised an autonomy referendum, which took place on 22 October 2017. 57.2% of Venetians participated in the referendum and 98.1% voted \\"yes\\". Consequently, President of Veneto Luca Zaia started a negotiation with the Italian government. Although it usually refers to the whole Venetian autonomist movement, the term \\"Venetism\\" is sometimes used to identify specifically culture-oriented Venetists, hardline Venetists or those Venetists who refuse the concept of Padania, a proposed country by Lega Nord, of which Liga Veneta (the most successful Venetist party so far) is the \\"national\\" section in Veneto. Alberto Gardin, a pro-independence publisher and later self proclaimed 121st Dogehttps://www.miglioverde.eu/venezia- suo-121-doge-eletto-alberto-gardin/ who supports the boycott of Italian elections, offers another interpretation by considering \\"Venetism\\" a \\"partisan concept, that is part of the Italian political system (Venetists, as Socialists, Communists, PD, PdL, etc.)\\". Background and history Annexation of Veneto by Italy The Venetian Republic existed for 1100 years from 697 to 1797 (submitted to Byzanthium until the 9th century), and was the one of the first modern republics of the world. After defeating the Republic of Genoa in a series of wars, it became the most powerful Mediterranean maritime power, and at its height, extended its rule from large parts of the Po Valley to the coastal regions and islands of present-day Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, and Greece. Venice was a leading power of the Western world in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1797, after a long decline, through the Treaty of Campo Formio, Napoleon traded what remained of the Republic with Austria in exchange for other territories. In 1848, Venetians, led by Daniele Manin, rebelled against Austrian rule and established the Republic of San Marco. Manin, who opposed the proposed unification by some Venetians with the Kingdom of Sardinia, resigned, but returned to lead again the opposition against Vienna in 1849. Venetian territories with the former Duchy of Mantua and Friuli were annexed to Italy in 1866, five years after the Italian unification and the creation of the Kingdom of Italy under the House of Savoy in 1861. The unification of Veneto with Italy was the result of the Austro-Prussian War, won by the Prussians, Italy's allies. In the Italian unification process, the conflict is known as Third War of Independence. Austria lost Venetia, ceded to Napoleon III of France, who in turn ceded it to Italy. Austria refused to give Venetian territories directly to Italy because the Austrians had crushed the Italians during the war, defeating the Italians on land during the Battle of Custoza (24 June) and on sea during the Battle of Lissa (20 July). Giuseppe Garibaldi's Hunters of the Alps had some success against the Austrians at the Battle of Bezzecca (21 July), but the Italian government ordered Garibaldi to withdraw when Prussia and Austria concluded an armistice. With the Peace of Prague (23 August), Austria agreed to the incorporation of Venetia in the Kingdom of Italy. The same point was repeated in the Treaty of Vienna (12 October), achieved through the mediation of France. The Venetian territory was first ceded by Austria to France (under a treaty signed by General Karl Moering, on behalf of Franz Joseph I of Austria, and General Edmond Le B≈ìuf, on behalf of Napoleon III) as a compensation for French neutrality during the war. According to the treaty, France ceded Venetia to Italy \\"under the reservation of the consent of the people duly consulted\\". Whether an option other than becoming Italian was available was unclear, nor was the treaty any more precise on how to consult the people. Venetia was already under Italian control after the French government renounced to it on 19 October.La Gazzetta di Venezia, 20 October 1866 This increases doubts on the real importance of the plebiscite and leading historians suggest that the referendum in Venetia was held under military pressure,Genova Giovanni Thaon di Revel, La cessione del Veneto. Ricordi di un commissario piemontese incaricato alle trattative, Lumachi, Florence 1906 as a mere 0.01% of voters (69 out of more than 642,000 ballots) voted against the annexation and a mere 0.1% (567 ballots) was null, and that it was ultimately rigged.Gabriele Riondato, Storia del Veneto , 2000 Some historians, who investigated into the historical archive of the Austrian foreign ministry, also suggest that the referendum was a mere administrative affair to Italy, just to formalise the sovereignty on a territory already under its possession, and that no real choice nor free vote was granted to the local population.Jaromir Beran Plebiscit in razmejitev v Beneƒçiji (1866 e 1867) (Il plebiscito e la definizione dei confini nel Veneto, 1866 e 1867 ‚Äì The plebiscite and the definitions of the borders of Venetia, 1866 and 1867), 1979 The plebiscite could have been a mere demonstrationSreƒçko Vilhar Jadranski koledar (Calendario adriatico ‚Äì Adriatic calendar), 1966, p. 86 to gain legitimacy after the bad conduct of Italy during the so-called Third War of Independence. The Kingdom of Italy adopted Italian as the official language. Venetians, similarly to several other regional communities, largely rejected that and continued to use their own Venetian language, often dubbed as dialect. Linguistic nationalism soon started to be part of Venetian culture, and during the last decades of the 19th century, also some revolts against Southern Italian bureaucrats occurred. After its incorporation to Italy, Venetia was so poor that millions of Venetians had to emigrate toward the Americas, especially Brazil and Argentina (nationalists claim that three millions left their homeland from 1870 and 1910), without losing their heritage, so even today, many Venetian descendants in Latin America, most notably in two Brazilian southern states, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, speak Venetian as their mother tongue. World Wars and the Italian Republic Right after World War I, the economic and political situation in Veneto was critical, so that a former Prime Minister and native of Venice, Luigi Luzzatti, wrote to Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando and told him there could be a \\"Venetian Ireland\\", in parallel to the simultaneous Irish War of Independence, while the prefect of Treviso signalled the risk that a separatist movement aimed at separating Veneto from Italy might flourish in the province of Treviso. Precursors of the present-day Venetist movement date back to before World War II and were both left- and right-wing. In 1920 La Riscossa, a Venetian newspaper close to the Socialists and the Republicans, espoused the need for a \\"united elective governorate with autonomous and competent technical and administrative organs\\" as an alternative to the \\"central political rule\\"Corriere del Veneto, 20 December 2009, p. 21 Guido Bergamo, a Republican member of the Chamber of Deputies elected in Veneto, wrote that \\"the Venetian problem is so acute that from today on we will preach the rebellion of Venetians. Citizens, let's not pay taxes, not recognise the central government in Rome, chase away prefects, retain the money from direct taxes in Veneto\\".Francesco Jori, Dalla ≈Åiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti, Marsilio, Venice 2009, p. 41 Shortly after Italico Corradino Cappellotto, a member of the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian People's Party, launched the first Venetist party forth of the 1921 general election: the Lion of Saint Mark won 6.1% of the votes in the province of Treviso.Francesco Jori, Dalla ≈Åiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti, Marsilio, Venice 2009, pp. 35, 41Ezio Toffano, Short History of the Venetian Autonomism , Raixe Venete After the takeover of Benito Mussolini, who among other things promoved to eradicate the local languages in favour of Italian language widespread, the rise of Fascism, World War II, and the birth of the Italian Republic, Venetist ideas lost ground, in an era in which the \\"myth of the indivisibility and the unity\\" of the country was strong even in Veneto. However, the campaign of Mussolini to eradicate regional languages was largely unsuccessful in the region, which soon became a stronghold of the Christian Democracy (DC) party due to the leading role of the Catholic Church in the region.Piergiorgio Corbetta; Maria Serena Piretti, Atlante storico-elettorale d'Italia, Zanichelli, Bologna 2009 In the 1948 general election Christian Democrats won 60.5% of the vote in Veneto. Since 1919, Venetia plus the newly annexed territories from Austria, which included Trentino and South Tyrol, were called the Three Venices (Tre Venezie, whereof Triveneto), meaning Venezia Euganea (the current Veneto plus large chunks of Friuli), Venezia Giulia (the eastern part of current Friuli-Venezia Giulia) and Venezia Tridentina (Trentino and South Tyrol). However, under the Constitution of Italy adopted in 1948, only Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia were granted of the status of special-statute autonomous region and the connected special privileges, mainly including fiscal autonomy. Hence, the proposals by some groups of unifying Veneto with the two regions cited above (or with Trentino alone) or giving also Veneto an autonomous statute. Comeback of Venetist ideas Venetist ideas made a comeback in the 1960s, when the Venetian Regionalist Autonomous Movement (MARV) campaigned for the institution of the ordinary regions (including Veneto), prefigured by the Italian Constitution.Francesco Jori, Dalla ≈Åiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti, Marsilio, Venice 2009, p. 35 The ordinary regions were finally instituted in 1970. Since the 1970s, Veneto experienced a dramatic economic boom due to a new production model based on small enterprises. The high burden of taxes and bureaucracy, associated with the increasing frustration with the inefficient and overstaffed Italian government in Rome, that continued to channel northern taxes as massive development aid to the corrupt and backward southern regions, was the key element, along with linguistic and historical claims, that led to the formation of Liga Veneta (LV) in January 1980. The opening speech of the first congress of the party in December 1979 recited: \\"Today for Venetians the moment has come, after 113 years of Italian unitary colonisation, to take their natural and human resources back, to fight against the wild exploitation that has brought emigration, pollution, and rooting out from their culture\\". European integration through the European Union (EU) was seen as an opportunity to give back to Veneto its autonomy. One of the regional leaders of Christian Democracy (DC), Antonio Bisaglia, early understood Veneto's demand of more autonomy and that his party, the dominant force in Venetian politics since 1946, would have been the main victim of the rise of LV as both parties competed for the support of the middle class. He thus proposed the evolution of the DC into a regional party on the model of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria. In 1982, Bisaglia tellingly declared, \\"Veneto would be mature for a federalist state, but this state, centralist and bureucratic [as it is], will never concede autonomy to my region\\". Opposition from Rome and Bisaglia's sudden death in 1984 stopped the plan of a regional DC on the \\"Bavarian model\\".Francesco Jori, Dalla ≈Åiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti, Marsilio, Venice 2009, pp. 46-47, 50-51 Giancarlo Galan, regional leader of Forza Italia and President of Veneto from 1995 to 2010, made a similar proposal in 2008, taking example mainly from the South Tyrolean People's Party,Giancarlo Galan, Il Nordest sono io, Marsilio, Venice 2008 but his \\"Forza Veneto\\" remained just an idea. The LV, whose leader in the 1980s and early 1990s was Franco Rocchetta, made its main electoral debut in the 1983 general election, when it garnered 4.3% in Veneto, resulting in two elects to the Italian Parliament. The party suffered many splits in its first decade of life and became a large political force only after its federation with other regional leagues, notably including Umberto Bossi's Lega Lombarda, which resulted in Lega Nord (LN) in 1991: in the 1996 general election, the party was Veneto's largest with 29.3%. However, clashes between Bossi and hardcore Venetists led to several splits; in 1994, Rocchetta left in protest, but more damaging was the 1998 split led by Fabrizio Comencini and Alessio Morosin, who launched Liga Veneta Repubblica (LVR). As a result, in the 2001 general election, the LV garnered a mere 10.2% of the vote, its worst score since 1987, while the LVR gained 4.9%. As the latter faded, the LV returned to gain ground in the 2005 regional election, despite the meteoric success of North-East Project (PNE). More recently, a string of separatist parties, notably including Venetian Independence (IV), emerged. Both in 1992 and 2000 the Italian Constitutional Court rejected proposals for an autonomy referendum, brought forward by the Regional Council of Veneto.http://www.forumcostituzionale.it/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2015/07/nota_118_2015_conte.pdf In the 2010 regional election the LV, in steady rise since 2001, was by far the largest party in the region with 35.2% of the vote, while its leader Luca Zaia was elected President of Veneto by a landslide 60.2%. The combined result of Venetist parties was 37.6%, the highest so far. In the 2015 regional election, the LV set another record by winning 40.9% of the vote (combined result of party list, 17.8%, and Zaia's personal list, 23.1%) and Zaia was re-elected President of Veneto with 50.1% of the vote and a more coherently Venetist coalition. Separatist parties (Venetian Independence, Independence We Veneto and Veneto Confederal State) obtained 5.4% of the vote, while other regionalist and/or Venetist parties (Tosi List for Veneto, LTV's sponsored Il Veneto del Fare list, North-East Union, and Autonomous Veneto Project) another 8.0% of the vote. Consequently, a majority of regional councillors adhered, at least to some extent, to Venetism. Recent developments 2012‚Äì2015 opinion polls on independence While support for a federal system, as opposed to a centrally administered state, receives widespread consensus in Veneto, support for independence is less favoured. Recent polls show a rise of independentism. According to an opinion poll made in December 2011, 50% of Venetians support the independence of Veneto. More strikingly, an opinion poll published on Il Gazzettino in January 2012 put those favoring independence at 53.3% (with the support from foreign-born Venetians at 55.0%).Veneto indipendente, il 53% sarebbe favorevole, Il Gazzettino, 20 January 2012Veneto, anche gli immigrati favorevoli all'indipendenza , L'Indipendenza, 20 January 2012 According to the same pollster, the support for independence rose to 56.7% in January 2013. According to a February 2014 poll by Ix√®, in a hypothetical referendum on independence, 47% of Venetians would vote yes and 26% no. According to a March 2014 poll by Ilvo Diamanti's DemosŒ†, 55% of Venetians favoured independence, 39% opposed it and the remaining 6% did not answer. According to a similar poll conducted by Istituto Piepoli, 64% of Venetians would vote in favour of more autonomy with 19% against, and 51% would vote for independence with 32% against. According to a DemosŒ† poll taken in October 2014, 53% of Venetians favoured independence, thus making Veneto the most separatist region in Italy, followed by Sardinia (45%) and Sicily (44%). In March 2015 DemosŒ† found that 57% of Venetians (including 83% of Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord's voters) favoured independence. Resolution 44/2012 on self-determination In 2012 Venetian Independence (IV), notably including Lodovico Pizzati, Gianluca Busato and Alessio Morosin, collected more than 20,000 signatures in support for a referendum on independence and presented them to President Luca Zaia. Zaia informed the Regional Council and its President Clodovaldo Ruffato asked an opinion to the legal office, which explained that such a referendum was not legal under the Constitution of Italy. On 6 October IV organised a march in Venice, during which it proposed a resolution (44/2012) for a consultative referendum on independence to be approved by the Regional Council: the text of the resolution was given to Giovanni Furlanetto, LV regional councillor, who supported the proposition. Another Council member, Mariangelo Foggiato of North-East Union (UNE), officially presented the resolution in the Council. On 17 October a total of 42 regional councillors out of 60 officially asked a discussion on the issue. On 28 November the Council approved the resolution, in which \\"independence\\" was replaced by \\"self-determination\\", with 29 votes in favour, 2 against and 5 abstentions. Those in favour included Foggiato, LV's entire group, most councillors of The People of Freedom, Pietrangelo Petten√≤ of the Communist Refoundation Party‚ÄìFederation of the Left, Diego Bottacin of Toward North and independent councillor Sandro Sandri, who had expounded the resolution at the start of the session, while the entire group of the Democratic Party left the floor in protest, but proclaimed their support for a special statute for Veneto. The document required Zaia and Ruffato to urgently open talks with the European Union (EU) and the United Nations in order to come up with a referendum proposal that will establish the will of the Venetian people on its self-determination. To achieve this goal, the two Presidents would have benefited from the help of a special commission of jurists. Petition to the EU and international support On 10 January 2013 a delegation of IV submitted to the European Commission in Brussels a petition, signed by 50,000 European citizens, mainly Venetians, to endorse the referendum on self-determination. The collection of signatures for the petition was also supported by Dom√† Nunch in Lombardy. According to IV leaders, the EU should support the referendum and guarantee its result, a notion which was contradicted by the attitudes of EU institutions toward the 2014 Scottish referendum. In March an appeal by international academics in support of resolution 44 was issued. The declaration, promoted by Marco Bassani, was signed by Frank Van Dun, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Donald Livingston, Ralph Raico, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, and Pascal Salin, along with Paolo Bernardini, Carlo Lottieri and Alessandro Vitale. According to the appeal, \\"the self-determination process\\" of Veneto \\"will be an important step toward a better Europe and men of goodwill have to do everything possible to ensure that the electoral process leading to the independence referendum takes place without tension and with respect for all the people involved\\". In Lombardy Bassani, Lottieri and several intellectuals around L'Indipendenza newspaper formed the Lombard Committee for Resolution 44. Further steps toward a referendum After a hunger strike by two members of IV, in March 2013 Zaia and Ruffato implemented the first step mandated by resolution 44 by appointing the special commission of jurists who would examine the referendum issue. The commission was composed of six experts, including IV's Luca Azzano Cantarutti. On 2 April Stefano Valdegamberi, floor leader of the Union of the Centre, who had abstained on Resolution 44 in November 2012, introduced a bill (342/2013) in order to call a referendum on independence by the end of the year. By 7 June the bill was endorsed by more than 15 regional councillors, sufficient to convene a special session of the Council on the issue. The Council discussed it on 30 July and 17 September, but in both cases no decision was taken. On 5 April Castellavazzo, Belluno (mayor: Franco Roccon, The People of Freedom) was the first municipality to pass a motion in support of bill 342. Since then, more than 180 comuni (out of 581), led by mayors of different parties and representing about 1,800,000 Venetians (out of approximately 4,860,000), expressed their support for it; they notably include Verona, Rovigo, Bassano del Grappa, Castelfranco Veneto, Vittorio Veneto, Arzignano, Legnago, Montebelluna, Jesolo, Montecchio Maggiore, Oderzo and Cittadella. Among provinces, Padua, Verona, Treviso and Venice, for a total of about 3,510,000 inhabitants, endorsed the bill. In February 2014 Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord launched its own campaign for a referendum on independence. On 1 April 2014 a committee of the Regional Council put forward bills calling for a referendum on independence and on more autonomy for the region. The move was supported by the representatives of Liga Veneta, Forza Italia (the minority faction), New Centre-Right, Popular Future, Union of the Centre and North-East Union, with the opposition of the Democratic Party, Italy of Values and the Federation of the Left. The day after, all the floor leaders of the parties (but the federation of the left) represented in the council officially asked the Italian government to give Veneto the status of a special-statute autonomous region and fiscal autonomy. The final document was approved by Liga Veneta, Forza Italia (both fations), New Centre Right, Union of the Centre, Italy of Values and North-East Union. On 10 June the Regional Council discussed and passed a law concerning five referendum questions concerning special autonomy. On 12 June the same legislative assembly passed Valdegamberi's bill 342/2013 in order to hold a referendum on the independence (question: \\"Do you want Veneto to become a sovereign and independent republic?\\") with 30 yeas, 12 nays and 3 abstentions. A year later the Constitutional Court ruled the independence referendum out as contrary to the Constitution, but authorised one of the five autonomy referenda (\\"Do you want the Region of Veneto to be granted of further forms and special conditions of autonomy?\\"). The event was unique as the Court had previously rejected proposals for similar referenda brought forward by the Regional Council of Veneto. Online referendum on independence Plebiscite 2013 (P2013), a non-partisan committee organised Plebiscito.eu, an online independence referendum, with no official recognition, for 16‚Äì21 March. P2013 had been launched by a group of splinters from IV, led by Lodovico Pizzati and Gianluca Busato, in July 2013. According to Plebiscito.eu's staff, 2.36 million Venetians (63.2% of all eligible voters) participated in the online referendum and 89.1% of them (that is to say 56.6% of all eligible voters) voted yes. This was enough for P2013 to proclaim Veneto's independence from Italy in Treviso on the night of 21 March. Voters approved also the adoption of the Euro (51.4% yes), EU membership (55.7% yes) and NATO membership (64.5% yes). The event was covered by several international media. During an interview with foreign journalists on 19 March, President Zaia announced that he too had voted (yes) in the poll, promised that he would bring bill 342 again to the discussion of the Regional Council and explained that he would seek \\"total independence\\" for Veneto. On 28 April, during a visit in Veneto, Minister of Interior Angelino Alfano acknowledged that \\"there is a Venetian question, which will be central in the government's relation with regions\\". In reference to what he called \\"Agenda Veneto\\", he said: \\"We think that Veneto could be the laboratory for a form of strong and advanced federalism. [...] We cannot close our eyes in front of independentist risings. [...] The answer is dual: enhancing autonomy and improving the government's services\\". For his part, Zaia explained to Alfano the \\"legitimate request of Venetians\\" for autonomy and independence, and that \\"the issue of autonomy and the desire of independence of Venetians cannot be resolved with an aspirin\\", concluding that \\"if Rome continues to sleep, it is inevitable that Veneto will organise by itself\\". Autonomy referendum and negotiation In March 2016 President Zaia announced that he had written to Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in order to start the negotiation both on the organisation of the referendum on autonomy and the devolution of further powers to Veneto according to article 116 of the Constitution. Zaia proposed the referendum to be held on the very same day of the 2016 constitutional referendum (which would reduce the regions' powers‚Äîarticle 117, while expanding the powers that can be devolved to regions according to article 116 and creating a regionalised Senate), a notion deemed legally impossible by undersecretary Gianclaudio Bressa, and the negotiation started in May. According to an opinion poll taken in June, 78.5% of Venetians would take part to the autonomy referendum, 78.4% would vote yes, 3.5% no and 18.1% did not know. According to the same poll, 70.7% of voters would participate also in the constitutional referendum, 41.3% would vote yes, 22.2% no and 36.5% did not know. Contextually, two bills calling for an independence referendum were introduced in the Regional Council, one by Liga Veneta's Marino Finozzi, Gabriele Michieletto, Alessandro Montagnoli and Luciano Sandon√†, with the support of Roberto Ciambetti (President of the Council), and the other by Antonio Guadagnini. In April 2017 Zaia announced that the autonomy referendum would take place on 22 October, along with a similar referendum in Lombardy. 57.2% of Venetians participated in the referendum and 98.1% voted \\"yes\\". Consequently, President of Veneto Luca Zaia started a negotiation with the Italian government. People and movements Prominent Venetists have included Goffredo Parise, Franco Rocchetta (founder of Liga Veneta), Ettore Beggiato (who wrote a book titled 1866: la grande truffa, meaning \\"1866: the great swindle\\"), Sabino Acquaviva (who perfaced the book by Beggiato), Gian Paolo Gobbo, Fabrizio Comencini, Alessio Morosin, Fabio Padovan, Giorgio Lago, Flaminio De Poli, Giampaolo Borsetto, Ivone Cacciavillani, Manuela Dal Lago, Luca Zaia, Flavio Tosi, Giorgio Vido, Giorgio Panto, Lodovico Pizzati, Antonio Guadagnini, Patrik Riondato, Loris Palmerini, and, to some extent, Giancarlo Galan, Massimo Cacciari and Mario Rigoni Stern. In November 2009 the Corriere del Veneto, the regional edition of the Corriere della Sera in Veneto, published a broad overview of what it described as \\"Venetist galaxy\\". The newspaper counted around 20 notable Venetist organisations: along the four major Venetist parties of the time (Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord, Liga Veneta Repubblica, North-East Project and Venetian National Party), a large variety of minor political parties, movements, cultural associations and trade unions were listed.Corriere del Veneto, 7 November 2009, p. 2 (a shortened version of the article is available here ). A prominent Venetist cultural association is Raixe Venete (Venetian Roots), which organises every year the well-known Festa dei Veneti in Cittadella.Francesco Jori, Dalla ≈Åiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti, Marsilio, Venice 2009, p. 143 The association has strong links with separatists from all over Europe and especially from the Basque Country. At the Festa dei Veneti, Venetists of every political colour, politicians of different political parties (including non-Venetist, both right and left), Venetist associations, actors, comedians, flag-wavers, musicians (notably including Herman Medrano), rock bands, and many people meet at the beginning of September every year. In November 2009 Raixe Venete organised a demonstration in Venice in support of the teaching of Venetian in schools: a wide range of people took part, from Roberto Ciambetti, leader of Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord in the Regional Council of Veneto, to Luca Casarini, a former far-left anti-globalisation activist and leader of the Tute Bianche in Veneto. The European Federalist Free Entrepreneurs (LIFE) was formed in 1994 by a group of Venetist entrepreneurs (Fabio Padovan, Diego Cancian, etc.) who opposed the \\"fiscal and bureaucratic oppression\\" of the \\"Venetian people\\" by Italy and demanded fiscal federalism and autonomy for the region. In particular, they decided to organise themselves as a trade union, saying that they were the most oppressed workers in Italy. Another notable association is Venetians Movement and was founded in 2006 by Patrik Riondato. Initially it presented itself as a cross-party political movement which aimed to promote independence in a democratic and nonviolent way. However, in 2010 it took part to the founding of the Party of the Venetians, a coalition of Venetist parties ranging from the centre-right to the far-left, which was later merged into Veneto State. Among the youth, the strongest organisation is Independentist Youth, whose most representative figures are Giacomo Mirto and Stefano Danieli. Other six leading although small groups are the self-proclaimed Venetian Most Serene Government (VSG), whose main leaders include Luigi Faccia and late Bepin Segato, Self-Government of the Venetian People led by Loris Palmerini, Venetian State of Vittorio Selmo, the Venetian National Liberation Movement (MLNV) led by Sergio Bortotto, the Venetian National Government of Gabriele De Pieri, and Self-Government of Venetia of Daniele Quaglia.Francesco Jori, Dalla ≈Åiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti, Marsilio, Venice 2009, pp. 105‚Äì111, 141‚Äì144 On the cultural side, it is worth of mention the Milizia Veneta (Venetian Militia), in practice a corp of people who perform historic representations of the Venetian army (including flag-raising at the Festa dei Veneti), Europa Veneta, Par San Marco and Veneti Eventi. The Venetist movement has also several publications, notably including Quaderni Veneti and Rivista Veneti. In the midst of the above-mentioned campaign for a referendum on independence, two non-party committees were launched: Plebiscite 2013 and Let Veneto Decide (later supplanted by United for Independent Veneto/We Independent Veneto/Independence We Veneto, which in turn became an electoral coalition of parties). A string of new parties was founded before and after the 2015 regional election and in the run-up of the 2017 autonomy referendum. Political parties \\"We are a nation, Veneto is not Italy\\", a campaign for the 2009 local elections. The first Venetist party in Veneto was Lion of Saint Mark, active from 1921 to 1924. It was succeeded by the Venetian Regionalist Autonomous Movement (MARV), a cultural-political association, which was active in the 1960s. The first organised Venetist parties were started only after the institution of Veneto as Region and the direct election of the Regional Council in 1970. Some Venetian parties campaign for federal reform, others for autonomy or a special statute for Veneto, others for an autonomous North-East region including Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol, some others for outright independence. Since the late 1970s many regional parties were founded in Veneto, covering all the ideological spectrum: *Liga Veneta (LV ‚Äì started in 1979, part of Lega Nord since 1991) *Liga Federativa Veneta (LFV ‚Äì started in 1983, merged into MVRA in 1987) *Liga Veneta Serenissima (LVS ‚Äì started in 1984, merged into UPV in 1987) *Venetian Most Serene Government (VSG ‚Äì started in 1987, still active) *Veneto Autonomous Region Movement (MVRA ‚Äì started in 1987, merged into LVR/VdE in 2000) *Union of the Venetian People (UPV ‚Äì started in 1987, merged into LV in 1995) *Lega Autonomia Veneta (LAV ‚Äì started in 1991, merged into MNE in 1997) *Liga Nathion Veneta (LNV ‚Äì started in 1994, disbanded) *North- East Union (UNE ‚Äì started in 1996, briefly merged into LVR/VdE in 1999, disbanded) *North-East Movement (MNE ‚Äì started in 1997, merged into The Democrats in 1999) *Liga Veneta Repubblica / Venetians of Europe (LVR/VdE ‚Äì started in 1998, merged into LFV in 2002) *Veneto Padanian Federal Republic (VRFP ‚Äì started in 1999, disbanded) *Liga dei Veneti (LdV ‚Äì started in 1999, merged into PNE in 2004) *Future Veneto (VF ‚Äì started in 1999 as part of ApE, merged into LVR/VdE in 2000) *Fronte Marco Polo (FMP ‚Äì started in 1999, merged into LFV in 2002) *Liga Fronte Veneto / Liga Veneta Repubblica (LFV/LVR ‚Äì started in 2002, merger of LVR/VdE and FMP, joined NVI in 2014) *Bellunese Autonomist Party (PAB ‚Äì started in 2003, joined PdV in 2009) *Free Veneto (VL ‚Äì started in 2004, joined PdV in 2010) *North-East Project (PNE ‚Äì started in 2004, merged into UNE in 2010) *Venetian Land (TV ‚Äì started in 2006, disbanded) *Venetians Movement (MV, started in 2006, joined PdV in 2009) *Venetian State (SV, started in 2007, joined PdV in 2009) *Party for Independent Veneto (started in 2007, disbanded) *Venetian Agreement (IV ‚Äì started in 2007, merged into UNE in 2010) *Venetian National Party (PNV ‚Äì started in 2007, joined VS in 2010) *Independentist Youth (started in 2008, still active) *Venetian People's Movement (MPV ‚Äì started in 2008, disbanded) *Venetian People's Unity (UPV ‚Äì started in 2008, briefly joined PdV in 2009) *Forum of the Venetians (FdV ‚Äì started in 2008, disbanded) *Lega Lombardo Veneta (LLV ‚Äì started in 2008, disbanded) *Venetian National Liberation Movement (MLNV ‚Äì started in 2009, still active) *Venetie for Self-Government (VpA ‚Äì started in 2009, disbanded) *Veneto Freedom / Party of the Venetians (VF/PdV ‚Äì coalition, started in 2009, merged into VS in 2010) *Party of Venetians (PdV - started in 2010, merged into VS in 2010) *Liga Veneto Autonomo (LVA ‚Äì started in 2010, disbanded) *Veneto State (VS ‚Äì started in 2010, joined NVI in 2014, disbanded) *Community Democratic League / Venetian Project (LDC/PV ‚Äì started in 2011, merged into VS in 2012) *Venetian Independence (IV ‚Äì started in 2012, joined the PdV of 2019 in 2019) *Plebiscito.eu / Veneto Yes (both started in 2012) *Veneto First (PiV ‚Äì started in 2013, joined the Greath North) *Venetian Left (Sanca Veneta ‚Äì started in 2013) *Independent Venetians (VI ‚Äì started in 2014, joined NVI/INV in 2014, disbanded) * We Independent Veneto / Independence We Veneto (NVI/INV ‚Äì coalition, started in 2014, disbanded) *Venetian Left (Sinistra Veneta ‚Äì started in 2015, merged into Italian Left in 2017) *Tosi List for Veneto (LTV ‚Äì started in 2015, disbanded) *We Are Veneto (SV - started in 2016, joined the PdV of 2019 in 2019) *Venetian Centre-Right (CDV ‚Äì started in 2017) *Veneto for Autonomy (VpA ‚Äì started in 2017, joined Forza Italia) *Party of Venetians (PdV ‚Äì coalition, started in 2019) Achievements Venetian language and culture Venetian is a non-standardised Romance language, that comes from Latin, not Italian. It has undergone Italian influences over the years, which have raised doubts on its identity, and includes several local varieties. The Venetian language is protected by some private institutions, such as the Academia de≈Ça bona creansa and the Venetian Language Institute. The United Nations includes in its website a Venetian translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. UNESCO gives to Venetian the status of not endangered language, as it is usually spoken in Veneto, Trentino, Friuli- Venezia Giulia (mainly in the provinces of Pordenone and Trieste), Croatia (mainly in Istria), Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina in Brazil, and Chipilo in Mexico. Venetian is a recognised language by UNESCO, Brazil and the Veneto region with the ISO 639-3 \\"vec\\" identifier, the same used by the Venetian-language Wikipedia, but not by Italy. In 2007 Veneto recognised Venetian as official language of the region, alongside Italian, instituted an official website for standard Venetian and proclaimed a yearly \\"Day of the Venetian People\\" (Festa del Popolo Veneto) on 25 March, anniversary of the foundation of Venice. In 2011 the Regional Council officially requested to the Italian Parliament to protect Venetian as a minority language under Italian law. Soon after the 2010 regional election, Daniele Stival (LV), new regional minister for Venetian Identity, appointed a commission of experts which will fix the rules of standard Venetian language and the official Venetian names of all 581 municipalities of Veneto. The commissioners included: Davide Guiotto, president of Raixe Venete; Gianfranco Cavallin, writer and linguist close to Raixe Venete; Sabino Acquaviva, sociologist and avowed Venetist; Rodolfo Delmonte, linguist; Michele Brunelli, linguist; Lodovico Pizzati, economist and secretary of Veneto State (later of Venetian Independence). Statute of Veneto (1971 and 2011) Most notably, the Statute of Veneto, first approved in 1971 and rewritten in 2011, cites the \\"Venetian people\\". In article 1 it proclaims Veneto as \\"an autonomous region\\" and in article 2 that \\"the self- government of the people of Veneto is implemented in forms corresponding to the features and the traditions of its history. The Region contributes to the enhancement of the linguistic and cultural heritage of its individual communities\\". Resolution 42/1998 on self-determination In April 1998 the Regional Council of Veneto approved resolution 42 concerning the \\"self- determination\\" of the \\"Venetian people\\". The resolution read: \\"The Venetian people [...] invokes its right to a democratic and direct referendum for the free expression of its right to self-determination\\". In 2006 the Regional Council officially asked to reform the Constitution of Italy in order to allow Veneto to be an autonomous region like its neighbours Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol. Acts 10/1998 and 28/2017: display of the Venetian flag Also in April 1998 the Regional Council approved a bill, signed into law as act 10/1998, which mandated the display of the Venetian flag outside regional institutions and offices, provincial institutions and offices, municipal institutions and offices, schools, universities and polling stations, besides Italian and European Union flags. In September 2017 the Regional Council approved a bill, signed into law as act 28/2017, reinforcing the provisions of act 10/1998. Among other things, the law extended compulsory display of the Venetian flag to Italian governmental offices in Veneto and \\"every time Italian and European Union flags are displayed\\". This part of the law was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court in October 2018, after that the challenge posed by the Italian government. Act 28/2016: Venetians as \\"national minority\\" In December 2016 the Regional Council approved a bill, signed into law as act 28/2016, aimed at recognising Venetians as a \\"national minority\\" (under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities), protecting Venetian language and opening the way to its teaching in public schools. Also this law was challenged by the Italian government and finally overturned by the Constitutional Court in April 2018. Controversies St Mark's Campanile assault The Tanko, the improvised armoured vehicle with which the Serenissimi \\"assaulted\\" Piazza San Marco on 8 May 1997. During the night between 8 and 9 May 1997 a group of armed Venetist separatists, the so-called Serenissimi, occupied Piazza San Marco and the St Mark's Campanile in Venice in order to proclaim the \\"independence of Veneto\\". After eight hours barred in the Campanile, the Carabinieri entered and arrested the group. The members of the group, including the two leaders of the Venetian Most Serene Government (Veneto Serenissimo Governo), Luigi Faccia and Bepin Segato, who did not take part to the action itself, were all jailed, tried and sentenced to prison.Alvise Fontanella, 1997: Il ritorno della Serenissima, Editoria Universitaria, Venice 1997.Francesco Jori, Dalla ≈Åiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti, Marsilio, Venice 2009, pp. 54, 105‚Äì111 The effort, which was more symbolic than anything else, was criticised by Umberto Bossi and Roberto Maroni, leaders of Lega Nord, at that time proponents of the independence of Padania, while it was praised by Gianfranco Miglio, a former senator of the League who was then elected as an independent for the centre-right Pole of Freedoms. The Serenissimi soon became a sort of \\"heroes\\" for many Venetists and the \\"tank\\", the improvised armoured vehicle with which they reached Piazza San Marco on that night is usually an exhibit at the yearly Festa dei Veneti and at other rallies of that kind, also outside Veneto. Segato was a candidate of Liga Veneta Repubblica in the 2001 general election and came short of election to the Italian Senate, having received 9.8% of the vote in the constituency of Schio. Representatives of most political parties in Veneto, including centre- left figures, defended the Serenissimi: Claudio Rizzato of the Democrats of the Left praised the \\"noble ideals\\" of the group, while Massimo Cacciari, the Democratic mayor of Venice, and Gianfranco Bettin, a Green former deputy mayor of Venice, campaigned for the pardon to those in jail, along with Liga Veneta and the regional section of Forza Italia. Some of them were not embarrassed in taking part to a rally, the Festa dei Veneti, where the tanko was on exhibit. More recently also Lega Nord founder Umberto Bossi and Roberto Calderoli, praised them and another leghista, Roberto Castelli, as minister of Justice in 2003, proposed a pardon for Faccia, who refused it. The MLNV and the \\"Venetian Police\\" In November 2009 some members of the Venetian National Liberation Movement, who had proclaimed themselves \\"National Liberation Movement of the Venetian People\\", were prosecuted with the charge of having built a paramilitary organisation. The Italian police seized arms and uniforms of the so-called Polisia Veneta (Venetian Police) led by Sergio Bortotto in the headquarters of the movement in Treviso. According to the police, the group had planned an aggression to Luca Zaia, a leading member of Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord, during the Festa dei Veneti of 2009, because he would have betrayed Venetist ideals by accepting to become minister of Agriculture in Berlusconi IV Cabinet. However the attack did not take place also because Zaia failed to show up in Cittadella on that occasion.Corriere del Veneto, 7 November 2009, p. 3 The day after Zaia declared: \\"Maybe those people confuse Venetism with something different. Being a Venetist, for me, means defending our heritage, promoting the language and the literature of this region\\".Corriere del Veneto, 8 November 2009, p. 5 (available as pdf ). In September 2017 all members of the MLNV were completely acquitted.Corriere del Veneto, 8 September 2017 Cancellation of the annexation of Veneto On 8 February 2011, the Corriere del Veneto reported that the act by which the Kingdom of Italy annexed the remaining portion of the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia (including current Veneto, Friuli, and the province of Mantua) in 1866 was cancelled by a decree that came into force on 13 December 2010, most likely by government mistake. It is unclear whether this will have any real and direct consequence, or will only be used by independentist groups to pursue a lawsuit in favour of an independent Venetian state (perhaps in front of the European Court of Justice) as previously done. The debate began a day later, with independentist and autonomist groups declaring that Veneto is no longer part of Italy. Political and juridical opinion are conflicted on whether Veneto still belongs to Italy or not, and a regional inquiry is due. On the following day, ministerial staff explained that the annexation act was cancelled because it had already been superseded by the Constitution of Italy, which ensures national unity. However, independentist groups were quick to point out not all legal opinions agree with this interpretation.http://www.doveneto.org/images/stories/PAPER%2020110210%20-%20Abrogata%20annessione.pdf In particular, the Treaty of Osimo, signed in 1975 by Italy and Yugoslavia, formally transferred the sovereignty of Italian \\"Zone-B\\" to Yugoslavia without any changes to the Constitution. This precedent show that the borders of the Italian Republic (hence the territory subject to the Italian Constitution) are established by means of international treaties, not the Constitution itself. Independentists have also argued that Italy can't determine its territorial extent in its own Constitution, as this would suggest it's legal for a state to unilaterally annex the territory of another state. Garibaldi's effigy burning controversy During the night between 28 February and 1 March 2011, at a Venetian New Year's Day's bruxamarso (a party which traditionally includes the stake of the passing year), a group of Venetists put at stake a shape of Giuseppe Garibaldi with a banner around the neck reading \\"l'eroe degli immondi\\" (\\"the hero of the unclean\\"), instead of \\"l'eroe dei due mondi\\" (\\"the hero of the two worlds\\"). The party was organised by Raixe Venete, Independentist Youth, Bortolino Sartore (leader of Liga Veneto Autonomo) and Patrick Riondato (leader of the Venetians Movement and leading member of Veneto State) and was attended by assorted Venetists, including several members of Liga Veneta. Luca Zaia, President of Veneto and leading member of Liga Veneta, while criticizing Garibaldi, dissociated from the act: \\"I love Veneto. I consider myself a Venetist, but burning a shape is a signal to be wary of\\" when \\"behind a shape there is a person\\". Also Luca Schenato, then leading member of Veneto State and contributor of Press News Veneto, a news website close to the party, criticised the act by saying that it \\"reminded me other latitudes where it is common to burn puppets of political enemies of the flags of Israel and the United States\\": \\"I do not see any need for that because my message is not of hate or war. My message and my thought are joyful, proactive and forward-looking. Raixe Venete, for its part, precised that it organised the party but not the burning itself. Alleged terrorist plot Franco Rocchetta in 2013. On 2 April 2014 a group of separatists, notably including Luigi Faccia and Flavio Contin of the Venetian Most Serene Government, LIFE's president Lucio Chiavegato and Franco Rocchetta, were arrested for suspected crimes including criminal association for terrorism and subversion of the democratic order. According to prosecutors, the group, which benefited from the collaboration by Venetists from the province of Brescia and separatists from other regions (including a group of Sardinians and Roberto Bernardelli, leader of Padanian Union), were preparing a remake of 1997's assault to St Mark's Campanile in Venice and a violent pro-independence demonstration in the run-up of the European Parliament election. A scraper turned tank, which was allegedly to be deployed in Piazza San Marco, was confiscated by Carabinieri. In jail Faccia proclaimed himself \\"war prisoner\\" and answer to questions (as Contin, in house arrest, and Lovato), Chiavegato started a 17-day hunger strike, while Rocchetta declared his innocence and pacifism. Many politicians, notably including President of Veneto Luca Zaia, and intellectuals called for an immediate release of the detained Venetists. Lega Nord organised a demonstration in Verona, Plebiscite 2013 compared Rocchetta to Nelson Mandela and other Venetists offered similar views. Also Clodovaldo Ruffato, President of the Regional Council, and Maurizio Sacconi, both of the New Centre-Right, expressed doubts on the investigation. On the left, Massimo Cacciari, Gianfranco Bettin and Beppe Caccia wrote a plea and remarked Rocchetta's pacifism: \\"In all the occasions in which we confronted ourselves with him, his idea of independence was a whole with the European perspective and the recognition of the rights of citizenship founded on jus soli and residence. [...] He is a world away from 'secessionisms' and the politics of exlcusion and racist closedness. With him we shared initiatives in the Balkans aimed at intercultural and interreligious dialogue, in terms of total opposition to the savagery of war and ethnic cleansing. [...] For how we knew him, we feel we can exclude his involvement in 'terroristic or subversive' activities [...]\\". Also the network of the far-left social centres expressed their sympathy for Rocchetta, with whom they shared some initiatives in the late 1990s, and the other Venetists; Tommaso Cacciari, one of the leaders of the movement, said that \\"we are without hesitation on the side of those who seek autonomy and independence against a state which is able to respond to these demands only with the inquiries of the judiciary and Carabinieri\\" and talked about the \\"signals of a national sovereignty in crisis\\". On 18 April Rocchetta and Chiavegato were released from prison as the tribunal of Brescia did not uphold the accusations of criminal association for terrorism and subversion of the democratic order. Most of the detained Venetists had been released earlier or were released right after, with the notable exceptions of Faccia and Contin, who refused to ask to be released. On 25 April, Feast of Saint Mark and Liberation Day, the released prisoners were celebrated in Venice. The rally was not approved by police authorities and criticised by the leader of the Venetian section of the National Association of Italian Partisans. Rocchetta, who wrote a letter to Corriere del Veneto to explain how the two anniversaries were not conflicting and that he was going to celebrate both, was hugged by Tommaso Cacciari. All the defendants were determined not guilty of any wrongdoing and completely acquitted in July 2018. However, seven of them, notably including former Serenissimi Faccia and Contin, were later sentenced to various years of prison in July 2020.https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2020/07/22/secessionisti- veneti-7-condannati-e-8-assolti-per-la-costruzione-di-un-tanko-stavano- fabbricando-due-cannoncini-pronti-a-sparare/5876725 See also *Politics of Veneto *List of political parties in Veneto *Republic of Venice *Triveneto References External links *it.Wiki article on the Serenissimi *it.Wiki article on the Festa dei Veneti Category:Veneto Category:Politics of Veneto Category:Separatism in Italy Category:Independence movements Category:Nationalist movements in Europe ","title":"Venetian nationalism"},{"id":"4520200","text":"Harry Woodson in 1885 Harry Woodson (1852 - October 15, 1887) was a professional boxer, nicknamed The Black Diamond, who was active during the 19th century in the Cincinnati area.

He was Governor of the Indies (Hispaniola) from 1502 until 1509, sent by the Spanish crown to investigate the administration of Francisco de Bobadilla and re-establish order. His administration subdued rebellious Spaniards, and completed the brutal \\"pacification\\" of the native Ta√≠no population of Hispaniola.Noble David Cook, \\"Nicol√°s de Ovando\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol.4, p. 254. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Early life Nicol√°s Ovando y C√°ceres was born in Brozas, Extremadura, in 1460. Born into a noble and pious family, second son of Diego Fern√°ndez de C√°ceres y Ovando, 1st Lord of the Manor House del Alc√°zar Viejo, and his first wife Isabel Flores de las Varillas (a distant relative of Hern√°n Cort√©s), Ovando entered the military Order of Alc√°ntara, where he became a Master (Mestre or Maitre) or a Commander-Major (Comendador- Mayor). This Spanish military order, founded in 1156, resembled the Order of Templars, with whom it fought the Moors during the Reconquista. His elder brother was Diego de C√°ceres y Ovando.  His Selection as Governor As Commander of Lares de Guahaba, Ovando became a favourite of the Spanish Catholic Monarchs, particularly pious Queen Isabella I of Castile. Thus, on 3 September 1501, in response to complaints from Christopher Columbus and others about Francisco de Bobadilla, Isabella appointed Ovando to replace Bobadilla. Ovando became the third Governor of the Indies, the Islands, and the Province of Tierra Firme.  His Expedition to the Americas  On 13 February 1502, he sailed from Spain with a fleet of thirty ships.D. H. Figueredo,\\"Latino Chronology: Chronologies of the American Mosaic\\", pg 14, 2007 It was the largest fleet that had ever sailed to the New World. The thirty ships carried around 2 500 colonists.\\"Latino Chronology: Chronologies of the American Mosaic\\" Unlike Columbus's earlier voyages, this group of colonists was deliberately selected to represent an organized cross-section of Spanish society. The Spanish Crown intended to develop the West Indies economically and thereby expand Spanish political, religious, and administrative influence in the region. Along with him also came Francisco Pizarro, who would later explore western South America and conquer the Inca Empire. Another ship carried Bartolom√© de las Casas, who became known as the 'Protector of the Indians' for exposing atrocities committed by Ovando and his subordinates. Hern√°n Cort√©s, a family acquaintance and distant relative, was supposed to sail to the Americas in this expedition, but was prevented from making the journey by an injury he sustained while hurriedly escaping from the bedroom of a married woman of Medell√≠n.Ovando made Hern√°n Cort√©s a notary and awarded him a land grant nonetheless. This started Cort√©s' career as a conquistador. The expedition reached Santo Domingo in April 1502, and included Diego de Nicuesa and Lucas Vazquez de Ayllon. Also on board were 13 Franciscans, led by Friar Alonso de Espinar, bringing the total on the island to 25.  His Administration  Island Hispaniola with Captaincy General of Santo Domingo When Ovando arrived in Hispaniola in 1502, he found the once-peaceful natives in revolt. Ovando and his subordinates ruthlessly suppressed this rebellion through a series of bloody campaigns, including the Jaragua Massacre and Hig√ºey Massacre. Ovando‚Äôs administration in Hispaniola became notorious for its cruelty toward the native Ta√≠no. Estimates of the Taino population at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards in 1492 vary, with Anderson C√≥rdova giving a maximum of 500 000 people inhabiting the island. By the 1507 census, according to Bartolom√© de las Casas, battlefield slaughter, enslavement and disease had reduced the native population to 60 000 people, and the decline continued. In 1501, Ovando ordered the first importation of Spanish-speaking black slaves into the Americas. Many Spanish aristocrats ordered slaves to work as servants in their homes. After the conquests made by his lieutenants including Juan Ponce de Le√≥n and Juan de Esquivel, Ovando founded several cities on Hispaniola. He also developed the mining industry, introduced the cultivation of sugar cane with plants imported from the Canary Islands, and commissioned expeditions of discovery and conquest throughout the Caribbean. Ovando allowed Spanish settlers to use the natives in forced labour, to provide food for the colonists and for ships returning to Spain. Hundreds of thousands of Ta√≠no died while forced to extract gold from the nearby mines. Pursuant to a deathbed promise he made to his wife Queen Isabella I, King Ferdinand II of Aragon recalled Ovando to Spain in 1509 to answer for his treatment of the native people. Diego Columbus was appointed his successor as governor, but the Spanish Crown permitted Ovando to retain possession of the property he brought back from the Americas. Ovando died in Madrid on 29 May 1511. He was buried in the church of the former monastery of San Benito de Alc√°ntara, which belonged to his military order and which sustained significant damage in later centuries.

The recent trend of the History of the Ryukyus Sai On (Gushi-chan Bunjaku) Three representative statesmen were described. They were given posthumous court ranks at the enthronement of Emperor Taish≈ç, and Iha gave a lecture about them at the Okinawa Normal School. They were Sai On, Haneji Choshu (Sh≈ç Sh≈çken (ÂêëË±°Ë≥¢)) and Giwan Ch≈çho. They managed to govern Ryukyu between Satsuma and China. Iha regarded them as the most important figures in Ryukyuan history. Sai On's advice to the King: Negotiations with China are not difficult. If difficulties will arise, Kume people can manage to handle them. But Japan is not so. On one day, with only a piece of paper, a King may lose his position and it is definitely from Japan. Okinawa's stand: to Okinawa, who will rule in China does not matter. Okinawa is not allowed to stick to justice. Okinawan people endure everything in order to live, or eat. An Okinawan saying says that who will let us eat, whoever it is, is our master. This is the fate of Okinawan people until the day of the placement of Okinawa Prefecture. To Japan, namely to the Shimazu clan, it did not know how to treat Okinawa soon after the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture. Seven kinds of Omoro S≈çshi Omoro S≈çshi is a collection of songs, 1553 poems and 1267 poems(when the same songs are excluded) in 22 volumes, starting in the middle of the 13th century and ending in the middle of the 17th century. It may be called the Man'y≈çsh≈´ of Okinawa. Omoro is the abbreviation of Omori uta, or songs sung in the sacred places of Ryukyu. The themes of the Omoro include the origin of Ryukyu, Kings, Heroes, Voyages, Poets, Sceneries, Heaven and Stars, very rarely Romance. Omoro is the primary source for studying the Ryukyuan languages and ideologies. The problem of students studying in China (Kansho) China allowed Ryukyuan princes and others to study in China; at first, Ryukyuan students did not get good achievements. The great king Sh≈ç Shin started to allow the people of the town of Kume, who had come from China only 128 years before, to study in China. They spoke Chinese of course, and got high achievements. Four students from Kume who studied in Nanjing came back seven years later. Four others on the next turn, came back seven years later. The people of Kume eventually came to believe that students only came from Kume. Toward the end of the 18th century, the Ryukyuan government, based in Shuri, realized that education and politics went hand in hand and thought students should be also from Shuri. The people of Kume resisted with strikes. This is called the Kansho Problem or Soudou. The P sound in Okinawan dialects The changes of the sound of P ‚Üí F ‚Üí H in Ryukyuan dialects suggest the changes from P through F to H in the languages of historical Japan proper. Take care that this is in Ko Ryukyu.Ko Ryukyu, 2000. p375-386 {|border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacina\\"0\\" |+On the sound of P in Ryukyuan dialect !item!!Shuri!!Kunigami!!Yaeyama!!Miyakojima!!Amami oshima |- !Leaf |fa||pa||pa||pa||ha |- !Tomb |faka/haka||paka||paka||paka||haka |- !Flower |hana||pana||pana||pana||hana |- !Fire |fi||pi||pi||(umatsu)||(umatsu) |- !Sun |tiida||pi||pi||pi||hi, hyuru |- !sail, canvas |fu||pu||pu||pu||fu |} In Late Middle Japanese it is written that although Proto-Japanese had a *[p], by Old Japanese it had already become […∏] and subsequently [h] during Early Modern Japanese where it remains today.

Mythologies in Okinawa. Okinawaology Okinawaology is not an independent field of science, but a general term of various aspects of Okinawa studies. Okinawaology originated from Iha's Ko Ryukyu (Old Ryukyu). In General Since Ryukyu was annexed by Japan, the Okinawan people tried to Japanize themselves, while there was a tendency that they were treated as an inferior people at that time. With this as the background, Iha studied the culture of both Japan and Okinawa, especially, the languages, history of Okinawa, and proposed the Okinawan people and Japanese people had the same ancestors. His studies started from Omorosoushi, and covered the study of history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, study of religions, mythology, the study of civilization, ethnology and literature. Using the Okinawan language, he tried to raise the pride of Okinawans in their land. His proposals have been established as the basis of Okinawaology. Those who study Okinawaology are not restricted to scholars. Okinawaology covers many other branches, such as politics, economics, laws, and natural circumstances. Tomb His tomb is at Urasoe Castle showing the following epitaph.

It is one of the nine 2600 launch titles Atari, Inc. published when that system was released in September 1977. The cartridge is a collection of games from Atari's popular arcade Pong series. A similar collection in arcade machine form called Tournament Table was published by Atari in 1978. Video Olympics was rebranded by Sears as Pong Sports. Gameplay The games are a collection of bat-and-ball style games, including several previously released by Atari, Inc. as arcade games. The games use the Video Computer System's paddle controllers, and are for one to four players (three or four players requires a second set of paddles). Games The Hockey variation Video Olympics includes 50 games and variations: * Pong - The classic table tennis simulation. * Super Pong - A Pong variation where each player has two paddles. * Robot Pong - A solitaire Pong variation. * Pong Doubles * Quadrapong - A four-player, four-wall Pong variation. * Foozpong - Based on Foozball, this Pong variant has the players control a vertical three-paddle column. * Soccer * Handball - A handball simulation. * Ice hockey * Hockey III - An ice hockey simulation where players can catch and shoot the puck at the opposing goal. * Basketball - A basketball simulation. * Volleyball - A volleyball simulation where the traditional (Pong-style) left-right volley is swapped for a top- bottom volley. Players can volley or spike. Reception The cartridge and its individual games were reviewed twice in Video magazine. In the Winter 1979 issue of Video, the cartridge was reviewed as part of a general review of the Atari VCS where it received a review score of 8.5 out of 10, and its constituent games were characterized as \\"old standbys\\" but \\"still lots of fun\\". A more thorough review appeared in Video's \\"Arcade Alley\\" column in the Summer 1979 issue where the release was generally praised for \\"tak[ing] Atari's Pong concept and explor[ing] it to the limit.\\" Individual games were singled out as well, with praise for Volleyball and Robot Pong (described as \\"astonishingly good\\"), and criticism for Handball (for its use of a visually disturbing blinking paddle rather than an absent paddle to indicate inactive players), and Basketball (described as primitive compared to Atari's own 1978 version of Basketball).

It was first published in United States in March 2006 and was released in the UK and Ireland on 1 June 2006. The paperback edition was released in the UK on 5 July 2007. It has also been adapted as a television series starring Marcus Nash & Rory Elrick, aired on the BBC from January 2009. Plot summary Fletcher Moon (often called \\"Half-Moon\\" due to his short stature) is a natural born investigator. Knowing this, April, a girl from his school comes to him for help in finding a lock of hair that she believes to have been stolen. Fletcher agrees to help her and starts off by investigating all suspects which eventually gets him threatened by a thirteen-year-old named Red Sharkey. Fletcher is a graduate from the Bernsteins Academy, so he is a \\"certified\\" detective. While Fletcher is investigating the stolen lock of hair he has a hurling stick thrown at him and is seriously injured. Fletcher holds Red as a prime suspect as the hurling stick had 'Red' embossed on it and comes to the conclusion that it was Red who attacked him. Fletcher then goes to visit April‚Äôs cousin May to photograph this newfound evidence but ends up at the wrong house where he catches sight of somebody setting fire to May‚Äôs lucky dancing costume. He passes out in the yard due to the anesthetic from the hospital and later awakens to find a torch in his hand and all evidence for the arson pointing to him. Following an interrogation by the police, Fletcher is rescued by Red Sharkey. Red claims he was framed for the hurl assault. Half-Moon and Red team up to solve the chain of mysteries within 24 hours. Following a suspicious story to April's house, the boy detectives discover the truth behind Les Jeunes Etudiantes, the girls club, their true goal being to get rid of all the boys ruining their education. Three recent expulsions can be attributed to these girls, and the boys feel they need to be stopped. Unfortunately, they are found out, and the girls manage to imprison the boys in the cellar. They are, however, saved by May, April's cousin. Fletcher and Red previously heard the girls practicing the lines that they planned to use to accuse Red's brother, Herod of assault. Red is able to send a text message to the present police officer informing him of the lines they would use. The police officer puts two and two together and exposes the girls as liars, and Herod Sharkey is found innocent, saving him from expulsion. April, being caught, attempts to escape in her father's car but promptly crashes into the police cruiser. However, Fletcher is informed (by text from the officer) that this still does not solve the mysteries that included his assault so he meets a secret informant, and in exchange for the password of the police account he hacked earlier in the story, receives the information that he desires. He finds that the link between the crimes ended up being the upcoming talent show at his school and it turns out that the victims each had a part in the show in some way. After trying to protect May from becoming involved with the criminal Fletcher at last finds the answer he had been looking for all along. All the victims of these crimes had been ranked higher than May in the talent show. So, Red suggests that May was behind all this. However, on stage, Fletcher proves that it was May's father, Gregor Devereux who was the culprit. In the epilogue, Red and Fletcher decide to form a detective group. Red suggests \\"Moon Investigations\\" while Fletcher replies by saying \\"You're half right\\", referencing his nickname and the title of the book. Critical reception Newsround called the book \\"really exciting\\" and said \\"Once you've read page one you'll be hooked to Eoin Colfer's Books\\". Sequel In a September 27, 2007 interview Colfer admitted he had a rough idea for a second Half Moon book in which Moon goes undercover with a group of goths and listens to Kate Bush and Metallica. He said would find it interesting to expand on the history of Hazel - Moon's sister. Television adaptation In 2008, BBC announced a series called Half Moon Investigations to replace Grange Hill. A single 13 episode series later aired.

The name of the College is derived from the Aboriginal word for the Sydney Cove area, \\"Warrang\\", highlighting the recognition by Warrane and UNSW of Australia's indigenous people as original inhabitants of land on which they are located.[Jose Manuel Cerda, Like a bridge over troubled waters in Sydney: Warrane College and the student protests of 1970, Studia et Documenta 4(2010) 147‚Äì181 http://www.isje.org/setd/2010/SetD%204-2010-6.pdf]  History  The prehistory of Warrane can be traced to the 1950s, when the Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Sir Norman Thomas Gilroy, first came into contact with members of Opus Dei and a sample of their educational initiatives in Europe. Around that time, the Archdiocese had the desire to establish a Residential College at UNSW under Catholic auspices. Opus Dei, an institution of the Catholic Church, provided the opportunity for this desire to become a reality[Cited in Walker, Church, College, pp. 434‚Äì435] and was invited to operate the college. Education Development Association (EDA), a not-for-profit company and a registered charity, was set up to represent Warrane College and future initiatives of similar nature. Pastoral care is entrusted to Opus Dei. Evening shot of Warrane College Warrane began operating at its present site in 1971 in an eight-storey building on Anzac Parade, Kensington, in the south-western corner of the UNSW campus. Warrane was officially opened by Sir Roden Cutler. Its five residential floors each provide accommodation for groups of 25 residents, two of whom are residential tutors. Since 2002 all bedrooms and bathrooms as well as dining and kitchen facilities, common areas and offices have been renovated. The College has had three Masters since 1971. Four staff members assist the Master in the running of the College: the Dean, two Assistant Deans and Bursar. Staff members live in College and make themselves available to assist students. Two residential tutors live on each residential floor. Tutors are mentors to the students, providing academic and personal support. Several academic tutors and residential fellows live in College. They are distinguished academic staff or students of UNSW who conduct the academic program of the College, including formal tutorials and consultation times for different university subjects.  Student life  The majority of students are undergraduate, with about a third in first year. While residents are from all university faculties, a large proportion belong to the faculties of Engineering, Medicine and to the Australian School of Business. There are normally several residents undertaking higher degree programs at UNSW such as Masters and Doctoral programs and younger students benefit from their experience. One of the main features of college life is the weekly formal dinner, which normally features guest speakers, including politicians, sportsmen, academics and business leaders. The college hosts several faculty nights during the year with guest speakers in specific fields talking to residents about career options and the \\"big picture\\" of their profession.  Sport  Warrane fields teams for all sports of the UNSW Inter-College sports shield. The competition is staged over both sessions and includes a number of major sports, such as Rugby Union, Soccer, Basketball, Hockey and Tennis. The competition also includes several carnival days for various sports, including Australian Football, Rugby League, Cross Country, Touch Football, Water Polo and Cricket. The College has won the Inter College Sport Shield several times and are the current holders, having won every year since 2012. Social sporting events are also organised within the college, including the \\"Warrane Wimbledon\\" tennis tournament and inter-floor touch football competitions.  Social life  Warrane's Activities Committee organises a wide range of social activities. Traditional events include trivia nights, movies, televised sporting events, beach barbecues, ski trips and bushwalks. The annual social calendar includes harbour cruises and informals organised with colleges from UNSW and the University of Sydney. The highlight of the college's social calendar is the Harbour Cruise, informally dubbed Boat Party. The Warrane Ball is a close second.  Cultural activities  Residents recognise the rich cultural diversity represented in the College by celebrating national days such as St Patrick's Day, Chinese New Year, Anzac Day and Autumn Moon Festival with special cuisine and entertainment. The Warrane play or musical has become a yearly fixture and during each session residents perform at the College Variety Night and at several musical nights. Residents also often form a college band and musical performances are a regular feature of birthday celebrations. The Activities Committee organises regular visits to cultural events such as concerts at Sydney Opera House, exhibitions at Art Galleries and museums and intra-College debating nights.

Considered the first true English novel, it serves as Richardson's version of conduct literature about marriage. Pamela tells the story of a fifteen-year-old maidservant named Pamela Andrews, whose employer, Mr. B, a wealthy landowner, makes unwanted and inappropriate advances towards her after the death of his mother. Pamela strives to reconcile her strong religious training with her desire for the approval of her employer in a series of letters and, later in the novel, journal entries all addressed to her impoverished parents. After various unsuccessful attempts at seduction, a series of sexual assaults, and an extended period of kidnapping, the rakish Mr. B eventually reforms and makes Pamela a sincere proposal of marriage. In the novel's second part Pamela marries Mr. B and tries to acclimatize to her new position in upper-class society. The full title, Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded, makes plain Richardson's moral purpose. A best-seller of its time, Pamela was widely read but was also criticized for its perceived licentiousness and disregard for class barriers. Two years after the publication of Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded, Richardson published a sequel, Pamela in her Exalted Condition (1742). He revisited the theme of the rake in his Clarissa (1748), and sought to create a \\"male Pamela\\" in Sir Charles Grandison (1753). Since Ian Watt discussed it in The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding in 1957, literary critics and historians have generally agreed that Pamela played a critical role in the development of the novel in English.Watt, Ian (1957). The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding. Berkeley: University of California Press. Plot summary Volume 1 A plate from the 1742 deluxe edition of Richardson's Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded showing Mr. B intercepting Pamela's first letter home to her mother. Pamela Andrews is a pious, innocent fifteen- year-old who works as Lady B's maidservant in Bedfordshire. The novel starts after Lady B has died, when her son, the squire Mr. B, begins to pay Pamela more attention, first giving her his mother's clothes, then trying to seduce her in the Summer House. When he wants to pay her to keep his failed attempt at seduction a secret, she refuses and tells Mrs. Jervis, the housekeeper, her best friend at the house. Undaunted, he hides in her closet and pops out and tries to kiss her as she undresses for bed. Pamela debates returning to her impoverished parents to preserve her innocence, but remains undecided. Mr. B claims that he plans to marry her to Mr. Williams, his chaplain in Lincolnshire, and gives money to her parents in case she will let him take advantage of her. She refuses and decides to go back to her parents, but Mr. B intercepts her letters to her parents and tells them that she is having a love affair with a poor clergyman and that he will send her to a safe place to preserve her honor. Pamela is then driven to Lincolnshire Estate and begins a journal, hoping it will be sent to her parents one day. The Lincolnshire Estate housekeeper, Mrs. Jewkes, is no Mrs. Jervis. She is a rude, \\"odious\\", \\"unwomanly\\" woman who is devoted to Mr. B; Pamela suspects that she might even be \\"an atheist!\\". Mrs. Jewkes constrains Pamela to be her bedfellow. Mr. B promises that he won't approach her without her leave, and then in fact stays away from Lincolnshire for a long time. Pamela meets Mr. Williams and they agree to communicate by putting letters under a sunflower in the garden. Mrs. Jewkes continues to maltreat Pamela, even beating her after she calls her a \\"Jezebel\\". Mr. Williams asks the village gentry for help; though they pity Pamela, none will help her because of Mr. B's social position. Sir Simon even argues that no one will hurt her, and no family name will be tarnished since Pamela belongs to the poor Andrews family. Mr. Williams proposes marriage to her to escape Mr. B's wickedness. Mr. Williams is attacked and beaten by robbers. Pamela wants to escape when Mrs. Jewkes is away, but is terrified by two nearby cows that she thinks are bulls. Mr. Williams accidentally reveals his correspondence with Pamela to Mrs. Jewkes; Mr. B jealously says that he hates Pamela, as he has claimed before. He has Mr. Williams arrested and plots to marry Pamela to one of his servants. Desperate, Pamela thinks of running away and making them believe she has drowned in the pond. She tries unsuccessfully to climb a wall, and, when she is injured, she gives up. Mr. B returns and sends Pamela a list of articles that would rule their partnership; she refuses because it means she would be his mistress. With Mrs. Jewkes' complicity, Mr. B gets into bed with Pamela disguised as the housemaid Nan, but, when Pamela falls into a fit and seems likely to die, he seems to repent and is kinder in his seduction attempts. She implores him to stop altogether. In the garden he implicitly says he loves her but can't marry her because of the social gap. Volume 2 A gypsy fortuneteller approaches Pamela and passes her a bit of paper warning her against a sham-marriage. Pamela has hidden a parcel of letters under a rosebush; Mrs. Jewkes seizes them and gives them to Mr. B, who then feels pity for what he has put her through and decides to marry her. She still doubts him and begs him to let her return to her parents. He is vexed but lets her go. She feels strangely sad when she bids him goodbye. On her way home he sends her a letter wishing her a good life; moved, she realises she is in love. When she receives a second note asking her to come back because he is ill, she accepts. Pamela and Mr. B talk of their future as husband and wife and she agrees with everything he says. She explains why she doubted him. This is the end of her trials: she is more submissive to him and owes him everything now as a wife. Mr. Williams is released. Neighbours come to the estate and all admire Pamela. Pamela's father comes to take her away but he is reassured when he sees Pamela happy. Finally, she marries Mr. B in the chapel. But when Mr. B has gone to see a sick man, his sister Lady Davers comes to threaten Pamela and considers her not really married. Pamela escapes by the window and goes in Colbrand's chariot to be taken away to Mr. B. The following day, Lady Davers enters their room without permission and insults Pamela. Mr. B, furious, wants to renounce his sister, but Pamela wants to reconcile them. Lady Davers, still contemptuous towards Pamela, mentions Sally Godfrey, a girl Mr. B seduced in his youth, now mother of his child. He is cross with Pamela because she dared approach him when he was in a temper. Lady Davers accepts Pamela. Mr. B explains to Pamela what he expects of his wife. They go back to Bedfordshire. Pamela rewards the good servants with money and forgives John, who betrayed her. They visit a farmhouse where they meet Mr. B's daughter and learn that her mother is now happily married in Jamaica; Pamela proposes taking the girl home with them. The neighbourhood gentry who once despised Pamela now praise her.  Characters  *Pamela Andrews: The novel's fifteen-year-old pious, na√Øve protagonist who narrates the novel.

Genre Conduct books and the novel Richardson began writing Pamela after he was approached by two book sellers who requested that he make them a book of letter templates. Richardson accepted the request, but only if the letters had a moral purpose. As Richardson was writing the series of letters turned into a story. Writing in a new form, the novel, Richardson attempted to both instruct and entertain. Richardson wrote Pamela as a conduct book, a sort of manual which codified social and domestic behavior of men, women, and servants, as well as a narrative in order to provide a more morally concerned literature option for young audiences. Ironically, some readers focused more upon the bawdy details of Richardson's novel, resulting in some negative reactions and even a slew of literature satirizing Pamela, and so he published a clarification in the form of A Collection of the Moral and Instructive Sentiments, Maxims, Cautions, and Reflexions, Contained in the Histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison in 1755. Many novels, from the mid-18th century and well into the 19th, followed Richardson's lead and claimed legitimacy through the ability to teach as well as amuse. Epistolary Epistolary novels‚Äînovels written as series of letters‚Äîwere extremely popular during the 18th century. Fictional epistolary narratives originated in their early form in 16th-century England; however, they acquired wider renown with the publication of Richardson's Pamela.Traversa, Vincenzo (2005), transl. Traversa, Vincenzo. Three Italian Epistolary Novels: Foscolo, De Meis, Piovene : Translations, Introductions, and Backgrounds, p. xii. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc. Retrieved 30 April 2014. Richardson and other novelists of his time argued that the epistolary form allowed the reader greater access to a character's thoughts. Richardson stressed in his preface to The History of Sir Charles Grandison that the form permitted the immediacy of \\"writing to the moment\\":Sage, Lorna, et al., eds. (1999). The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, p. 224. Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 30 April 2014. that is, Pamela's thoughts were recorded nearly simultaneously with her actions. In the novel, Pamela writes two kinds of letters. At the beginning, while she decides how long to stay on at Mr. B's after his mother's death, she tells her parents about her various moral dilemmas and asks for their advice. After Mr. B. abducts her and imprisons her in his country house, she continues to write to her parents, but since she does not know if they will ever receive her letters, the writings are also considered a diary. In Pamela, the letters are almost exclusively written by the heroine, restricting the reader's access to the other characters; we see only Pamela's perception of them. This makes the reader to see Pamela's character development over the duration of the novel.Flynn, Carol. Samuel Richardson: A Man of Letters. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982. In Richardson's other novels, Clarissa (1748) and The History of Sir Charles Grandison (1753), the reader is privy to the letters of several characters and can more effectively evaluate the characters' motivations and moral values. Literary significance and criticism Reception Illustration from a 1741 pirated edition Considered by many literary experts as the first English novel, Pamela was the best-seller of its time. It was read by countless buyers of the novel and was also read in groups. An anecdote which has been repeated in varying forms since 1777 described the novel's reception in an English village: \\"The blacksmith of the village had got hold of Richardson's novel of Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded, and used to read it aloud in the long summer evenings, seated on his anvil, and never failed to have a large and attentive audience.... At length, when the happy turn of fortune arrived, which brings the hero and heroine together, and sets them living long and happily... the congregation were so delighted as to raise a great shout, and procuring the church keys, actually set the parish bells ringing.\\"Fysh, Stephanie (1997). The Work(s) of Samuel Richardson, p. 60. University of Delaware Press. . The novel was also integrated into sermons as an exemplar. It was even an early ‚Äúmultimedia‚Äù event, producing Pamela- themed cultural artefacts such as prints, paintings, waxworks, a fan, and a set of playing cards decorated with lines from Richardson's works.Fysh (1997), p. 58. Given the lax copyright laws at the time, many unofficial sequels were written and published without Richardson's consent, for example, Pamela's conduct in high life, published 1741 and sometimes attributed to John Kelly (1680?‚Äì1751). There were also several satires, the most famous being An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews by Henry Fielding, published under the pseudonym \\"Mr. Conny Keyber\\". Shamela portrays the protagonist as an amoral social climber who attempts to seduce \\"Squire Booby\\" while feigning innocence to manipulate him into marrying her. In this version, the author works to invalidate Pamela by pointing out the incongruities between characters and the overall plot of the story. This version suggests that she was not really as virtuous as she may have seemed to be. Another important satire was The Anti-Pamela; or Feign‚Äôd Innocence Detected (1741) by Eliza Haywood. Although not technically a satire, the Marquis de Sade's Justine is generally perceived as a critical response to Pamela, due in part to its subtitle, \\"The Misfortunes of Virtue\\". At least one modern critic has stated that the rash of satires can be viewed as a conservative reaction to a novel that called class, social and gender roles into question. by asserting that domestic order can be determined not only by socio-economic status but also by moral qualities of mind. Richardson's revisions The popularity of Richardson's novel led to much public debate over its message and style. Richardson was of the artisanal class, and among England's middle and upper classes, where the novel was popular, there was some displeasure over its at times plebeian style. Apparently certain ladies of distinction took exception to the ways in which their fictional counterparts were represented. Richardson responded to some of these criticisms by revising the novel for each new edition; he also created a \\"reading group\\" of such women to advise him. Some of the most significant changes he made were alterations to Pamela's vocabulary: in the first edition her diction is that of a labouring-class woman, but in later editions Richardson made her more linguistically middle- class by removing the working-class idioms from her speech. In this way, he made her marriage to Mr. B less scandalous as she appeared to be more his equal in education. The greatest change was to have her his equal too in birth‚Äîby revising the story to reveal her parents as reduced gentlefolks. In the end Richardson revised and released fourteen editions of Pamela, the last of which was published in 1801 after his death. Original sources A publication, Memoirs of Lady H, the Celebrated Pamela (1741), claims that the inspiration for Richardson's Pamela was the marriage of a coachman's daughter, Hannah Sturges, to the baronet, Sir Arthur Hesilrige, in 1725. Samuel Richardson claimed that the story was based on a true incident related to him by a friend about 25 years before, but did not identify the principals.Keymer, Thomas, and Sabor, Peter (2005). Pamela in the Marketplace: Literary Controversy and Print Culture in Eighteenth-Century Britain and Ireland, pp. 100‚Äì02. Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 30 April 2014. Shirin and Pamela Pamela has significant similarities to the famous Persian tragic romance of Khosrow and Shirin by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi. In both tales a rich, famous, and hedonistic man is trying to seduce the main female character of the story. Even though the female character is truly in love with the male counterpart, she resists his seductions and requests a proper marriage. At the end the male character gives in to an official marriage with the woman he loves and this love causes a gradual and positive change in the male character. The moral of both stories is the triumph of patience, virtue and modesty over despotism and hedonism.  Feminism in Pamela  Some believe that Richardson was one of the first male writers to take a feminist view while writing a novel. Pamela has been described as being a feminist piece of literature because it rejects traditional views of women and supports the new and changing role of women in society. One of the ways in which feminism is shown in the text is through allowing readers to see the depths of women (i.e. their emotions, feelings, thoughts) rather than seeing women at surface level. The letters allow readers to see how Pamela feels about the events occurring in her life and how she chooses to handle these events. She is seen as an independent intellectual who can think for herself rather than a working housewife who depends completely on her husband. Adaptations Paintings Pamela Fainting by Joseph Highmore (April 1743) Around 1742 Francis Hayman also produced two paintings drawing on scenes and themes from the novel for supper boxes 12 and 16 at Vauxhall Gardens. The painting for Box 12 is now lost but showed the departure scene from Letter XXIX, whilst the one for Box 16 shows Pamela fleeing to Mr B.'s coach after revealing her marriage to Lady Davers and Mr B.'s servant Colbrand forcibly defending her from two of Lady Davers' servants.Leigh G. Dillar, 'Drawing Outside the Book ‚Äì Parallel Illustration and the Creation of a Visual Culture', in The latter was bought from the Gardens in 1841 by William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale, whose heirs sold it in 1947 to Henry Hornyold-Strickland, who in turn donated it to the National Trust as part of the house, collections and gardens of Sizergh Castle in 1950. Soon afterwards, in 1743, Joseph Highmore produced a series of twelve paintings as the basis for a set of engravings. They are a free adaptation of the novel, mainly focusing on the first book. They are now equally divided between Tate Britain, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Fitzwilliam Museum, each of which has four of the series. Stage Its success also led to several stage adaptations in France and Italy. In Italy, it was adapted by Chiari and Goldoni. In France, Boissy put on a Pam√©la ou la Vertu mieux √©prouv√©e, a verse comedy in three acts (Com√©diens italiens ordinaires du Roi, 4 March 1743), followed Neufch√¢teau's five-act verse comedy Pam√©la ou la Vertu r√©compens√©e (Com√©diens Fran√ßais, 1 August 1793). Appearing during the French Revolution, Neufch√¢teau's adaptation was felt to be too Royalist in its sympathies by the Committee of Public Safety, which imprisoned its author and cast (including Anne Fran√ßoise Elisabeth Lange and Dazincourt) in the Madelonnettes and Sainte-P√©lagie prisons. Mademoiselle Lange's straw hat from the play launched a trend for Pamela hats and bonnets which were worn well into the second half of the nineteenth century. Pamela was also the basis for the libretto of Niccol√≤ Piccinni's comic opera La buona figliuola. Playwright Martin Crimp uses the text as a \\"provocation\\" for his stage play When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other: 12 Variations on Samuel Richardson‚Äôs Pamela, opening at the Royal National Theatre in 2019 starring Cate Blanchett and Stephen Dillane directed by Katie Mitchell. Novels The success of Pamela soon led to its translation into other languages, most notably into French by abb√© Pr√©vost. It was also imitated by Robert-Martin Lesuire in his own novel la Pam√©la fran√ßaise, ou Lettres d‚Äôune jeune paysanne et d‚Äôun jeune ci-devant, contenant leurs aventures. More recently, Bay Area author Pamela Lu's first book Pamela: A Novel evokes Richardson's title and also borrows from Richardson the conceit of single-letter names to create a very different type of \\"quasi-bildungsroman,\\" according to Publisher's Weekly.

Its most popular car in the 1950s was the US sourced badge engineered trio: Plymouth Cranbrook, Dodge Kingsway and De Soto Diplomat, each based on the 1954 US Plymouth.The Australian Chrysler Royal, Plainsman, and Wayfarer Retrieved from allpar.com on 18 September 2008 A coupe utility variant was also developed by Chrysler Australia and this was marketed in nine different versions; the Plymouth Cranbrook, Savoy & Belvedere, the Dodge Kingsway Custom, Kingsway Crusader & Kingsway Coronet and the De Soto Diplomat Custom, Diplomat Regent & Diplomat Plaza.Plymouth, Dodge & De Soto Coupe Utilities Retrieved from www.roadkillontheweb.com on 18 September 2008 The Plymouth sedan was a popular choice for taxicab usage however the rise in popularity of the Holden during this decade led to the decline of this range of cars. The Dodge Phoenix was produced by Chrysler Australia from 1960 (pictured) to 1973 In 1957, Chrysler Australia consolidated each of the badge- engineered marques in one car‚Äîthe Chrysler Royal. This was a facelifted version of the 1954 Plymouth, and it was to continue in production until 1963. The Royal was an automotive curiosity. Starting life as a side-valve 6-cylinder manual, with 3-speed manual column gearchange, it was progressively modified, with the addition of US sourced engineering features such as power steering, the push button \\"Powerflite\\" automatic transmission and an OHV V8. On the styling front US \\"Forward Look\\" style tailfins were grafted on the rear of the car, while the front end gained dual (vertically stacked) headlights. These changes failed to arrest the slide in sales, as General Motors-Holden came to dominate the Australian market, and the Royal was viewed as being outmoded and expensive. Production ceased in 1963. The saving grace for Chrysler at this time was the French Simca Aronde‚Äîa popular 4-cylinder compact car which Chrysler Australia assembled from CKD kits at their Forestville factory. Local engineers developed an Aronde station wagon unique to Australia, with a then-novel wind-down rear window and tailgate. (Chrysler USA had acquired an interest in Simca in 1958, the basis for sourcing of this car). The assembly and marketing of Simca Aronde and Vedette models by Chrysler Australia was announced on 1 July 1959.Now it's Chrysler-Simca, Australian Motor Sports, July 1959, page 271 In both 1958Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 74 and 1959 Chrysler Australia released Plymouth Belvedere, Dodge Custom Royal and DeSoto Firesweep models which were imported from the US in CKD form and assembled at Chrysler's Adelaide facilities.News Review, Three Chryslers, Australian Motor Sports, August 1959, Page 314 The Plymouth was fitted with a 318-cubic-inch V8 engine and the Dodge and de Soto models featured a 361-cubic-inch V8. Assembly of the three models was discontinued in 1960 and they were replaced by a single model, the Dodge Phoenix,Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, 2010, page 77 which was produced by Chrysler Australia through to 1973.The Macquarie Dictionary of Motoring, 1986, pages 120-121 In 1964New Plant Built in Record Time, The Advertiser, Friday, 2 October 1964, page 26 Chrysler opened its Tonsley Park assembly plant located in the Adelaide suburb of Clovelly Park. An engine manufacturing plant was opened at Lonsdale in November 1967.Gavin Farmer, Great Ideas in Motion, A History of Chrysler in Australia 1946‚Äì1981, pages 359 to 361 These new factories replaced facilities at Keswick, Mile End and Finsbury. During this time, Chrysler Australia established its position as the third of the \\"Big 3\\" Australian motor manufacturers behind General Motors-Holden and Ford Australia. Valiant years 1960s The Chrysler S Series Valiant. The Valiant was produced by Chrysler Australia from 1962 to 1980 Beginning in 1962, Chrysler Australia assembled the American Plymouth Valiant, marketed as the Valiant by Chrysler.1962 Valiant by Chrysler sales brochure Retrieved on 5 September 2010 By 1963, they had developed a local version, the AP5 Valiant, with distinctive styling giving the car a separate identity from the US Plymouth and Dodge variants. The reason for developing different styling was concern that the local manufacturer could not afford to make substantial styling changes as quickly as in the US. Hence, a modified appearance would minimise the risk of accusations that Australia was selling \\"last year's model\\". Through the 1960s, Chrysler expanded the Valiant range, with 2-door hardtop, long wheelbase (VIP) and sporty (Pacer) variants. Also, in 1966, with the Chrysler USA acquisition of the British Rootes Group, Chrysler Australia took over the Rootes Australia as well as the operation of their Port Melbourne factory. The principal Rootes model sold in Australia was the Hillman Hunter and this car became a steady seller for Chrysler until 1973. 1970s Prototype of the \\"Hemi\\" 245-cubic-inch engine In 1970, they introduced the unique-to-Australia \\"Hemi\\" 6-cylinder engine‚Äîlaunched with an endorsement from Stirling Moss. Billed as being \\"Right‚Äîfor all the right reasons\\", this engine went on to become the most powerful 6-cylinder engine produced in Australia (equipped with triple Weber carburettors). Though this engine was based on a US engine design for trucks, it was never produced in North America. The Valiant was a good seller, but never quite gained the level of market acceptance as its major competitors‚Äîthe Holden and the Falcon. In 1971, Chrysler Australia released the Valiant VH model (still based on the US A-Body platform), it was significantly wider than earlier Valiants, with the lineup including the memorable Valiant Charger. This was a short-wheelbase (105-inch) two-door hardtop version of the standard Valiant. The car had distinctive sporty styling, including an integrated rear spoiler. The base model Charger was A$2750, and the range extended upwards with high-performance and luxury models. Charger won the \\"Wheels\\" magazine Car of the Year award in 1971. It was also a winner in the sales stakes, capturing the imagination of the Australian public in the same way as the Ford Mustang did in the US and the Ford Capri did in the UK. By the mid-1970s, sales of the Valiant range stalled, as a combination of factors worked against Chrysler Australia: #The Oil Crisis led to the rise of smaller economical 4-cylinder cars; #Japanese competitors made significant inroads into the Australian marketplace, and 4-cylinder cars were their forte; #Valiant was increasingly perceived as being outmoded‚Äînotwithstanding a major facelift in 1971 (billed as an \\"all-new\\" model) with a new body surrounding the existing mechanicals‚Äîthe styling rapidly dated compared with other new cars, and the body was only lightly facelifted in 1973 and 1975. A significant facelift in 1976 arrested the slide in sales, and the Valiant continued to sell steadily until 1981. Chrysler KB Centura In 1975, Chrysler introduced the Centura with a choice of a 2-litre (4-cylinder) and 3.5-litre or 4-litre (6-cylinder) engines, and two equipment levels, XL and GL. This was a medium-sized competitor for the Holden Torana and the Ford Cortina. The 'KB' Centura was based on the European Chrysler 180 (which had been introduced in Europe in 1970), with facelifted front and rear styling (reputedly based on the intended design for a Sunbeam version of this car, which never reached production). The launch of the Centura was delayed by several years as a result of embargoes placed on French imports, due to France conducting Pacific nuclear bomb tests, which impeded the supply of parts. By the time the car arrived in Australia, its appearance was dated and, as a result, the Centura did not generate significant market interest. A mild 'KC' Centura update in GL and GLX variants combined with a simplified choice of two versions of the 4-litre engine arrived in 1977, but the car then quietly disappeared from the market by the end of 1978. Relationship with Mitsubishi Motors Australia Chrysler CM Regal Wagon. Production of CM series Valiants and Regals was continued by Mitsubishi after its takeover of Chrysler Australia Chrysler Australia's parent company began working closely with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation after they acquired a 15 percent interest in the company in 1971, with the result that Chrysler Australia began building the Mitsubishi-designed Chrysler Valiant Galant. The association with Mitsubishi also gave Chrysler Australia another winner‚Äîthe 1977 Chrysler Sigma. With a range of 4-cylinder \\"Silent Shaft\\" engines, competitive pricing, \\"Japanese\\" style and the availability of a luxurious \\"SE\\" version, with optional leather trim (an innovative sales approach in its era), the Sigma marked Chrysler's sales comeback. Sigma soon became market leader in its class. In 1979 Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation each acquired a one sixth equity in Chrysler Australia and in April 1980 the two companies purchased the remaining shares in the company from the US Chrysler Corporation,The Macquary Dictionary of Motoring, 1986, page 310 which was in bailout negotiations with the US government. The company name was changed to Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited on 1 October 1980. Mitsubishi continued to build the Valiant models with Chrysler badging until August 1981Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 155 and production of the Sigma range continued under the Mitsubishi name until 1987. Colt, Magna, Verada and 380 models were subsequently produced before production of passenger vehicles was discontinued in March 2008.Mitsubishi Motors Australia Media release announcing closure of factory The company continues to operate today as one of Australia's major importers of road vehicles. Chrysler return to Australian market Chrysler returned to Australia in 1994, initially imported the Jeep Cherokee, then expanding the range to include the Chrysler Neon (discontinued in 2002) Grand Cherokee, Jeep Commander, PT Cruiser, Crossfire, 300C, Voyager and Dodge Caliber. Initially, the attraction of the Jeep range was \\"value for money\\" although the first cars became known for poor quality of construction. In the 2000s, a range of vehicles was imported from the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Austria. The Chrysler 300C found a successful niche as an alternative to Australian prestige cars‚Äîgenerally extended-wheelbase versions of traditional Australian family cars‚Äîthe Holden Statesman/Caprice and Ford Fairlane/LTD.

Morgan became the first winner to resign, and the second (after Marjorie Wallace) not to finish her reign as Miss World. Biography Born in Walsall, she worked in a bank. Entering modelling competitions on a part-time basis, she won the Miss Wales and Miss United Kingdom titles in 1974. Morgan represented Wales in the Miss Universe 1974 pageant, where she finished first runner-up to Amparo Mu√±oz of Spain. When Mu√±oz resigned as Miss Universe before the end of her reign, the crown was not offered to Morgan or any other runner-up. Miss World 1974 Winning Miss United Kingdom earned Morgan the right to represent the United Kingdom in Miss World. She had originally been reluctant to enter the Miss Wales competition, and was eventually paid ¬£30 as a last-minute stand-in when another competitor dropped out. Morgan became the second Welsh woman and the fourth UK representative to win the competition in 1974. However, she was forced to resign only four days after winning the pageant, upon the media creating extremely negative and lurid headlines as she was an unwed mother with an 18-month-old son. This had never been hidden from the time she was crowned Miss Wales, but the lurid headlines in the hours immediately following her win at Miss World, particularly interviews given by the wife of the child's father, created extreme pressure on Morgan and the Miss World organization. Although this did not violate any of the competition rules (which stipulated only that entrants must be unmarried), pressure was placed on her by the Miss World Organisation that she should resign to save them from further potential embarrassment. The first runner-up, Anneline Kriel of South Africa, succeeded her. Morgan became the first winner to resign, and the second Miss World titleholder not to finish her reign. The first case was that of Miss World 1973, Marjorie Wallace, who, according to pageant officials, was stripped of the crown for \\"failing to fulfill the basic requirements of the job\\" a few months into her reign. After Miss World Threatened with being a named party in a divorce ‚Äì an action which was later dropped ‚Äì Morgan was allowed to keep her other titles. She resigned from the bank, and undertook a career in modeling, TV and films. After modelling Morgan married and moved to Surrey in the 1980s, and had two more children, Poppy and Ben. She later left the UK, and now lives in Spain with her husband Ronny Lamb and family. In 2004, Morgan agreed to judge the 2004 Miss Wales competition in Swansea, the 30th anniversary of her competition win, won by Amy Guy.

Justice of the Peace (9 September 1887), was an English soap manufacturer of great prominence in Australia. He was also a Director of Aberdare Collieries Co. Ltd., and the Chairman of the board of management for its railways.The Daily Telegraph, Sydney, 30 April 1904, p.10. Family & background Charles Upfold was born in Grove Street, Walworth Common, (both now gone), Surrey (today Walworth, London), then a prosperous middle-class district. His father, John Upfold, was a fellmonger. Charles was baptised in Sir John Soane's new St.Peter's Church of England at Walworth, on 7 January 1835. An excellent photograph of this splendid church can be found on page 206 of London's Churches by Christopher Hibbert. Charles Upfold served his apprenticeship as a soap maker with John Knight & Co.\\"The Story of John Ambrose Kitchen\\" in The Unilever Australia Reporter, September 1956, p.21. at their Wapping soapworks in London, just across the river from the parishes where Charles's father resided and worked. Knight's Castile soap is still sold today. His sister, Eliza, married James Knight. Charles was later a Director of Knights. Charles appears on the UK 1851 Census Return, with his parents and married sister Eliza Knight at 11 Brandon Street, parish of St.Mary Newington, London, (then in Surrey), where he is described as a \\"soap maker\\". Business in New South Wales In 1860 he was already engaged in business in New South Wales and upon his marriage at West Maitland, New South Wales in 1864 (to Sarah, n√©e Blundell, from Finchley), he was described as a \\"soap maker\\". When his first son, John, was born in 1865 at Morpeth, New South Wales, Charles was described as a soap-boiler, aged 27 years and born at Walworth, London, England. When his son Robert was born in 1869, Charles was described as a \\"soap manufacturer\\". That year Charles Upfold purchased the soap and candle factory of Frederick Nainby at Wickham and Honeysuckle Point, Newcastle, and in the Newcastle Chronicle of 16 May 1869 there is a reference to the \\"Great Northern Soap and Candle Works, proprietor, Charles Upfold.\\" By the following year Upfolds plants were producing 9,420 hundredweight of soap and 600 cwt of candles. By 1872 soap production had increased to 21,000 cwt. Most was exported, much to China. That year Upfold expanded his Australian trading links by establishing a Sydney office at 50 Clarence Street. In 1877 Charles Upfold had been back in London and visiting factories in England. The following year he is listed under Wickham, in Newcastle, \\"Charles Upfold, soap manufacturer\\". Also in Wickham were Charles's three brothers-in-law, Albert, James, and John Blundell, who came from Finchley, Middlesex, (north London), and were clearly all working for Charles as their occupations are given as soap-boilers.Official Post Office Directory, New South Wales, Government Printer, p.621. Expansion In 1885 Charles Upfold was rapidly expanding his industrial base, having purchased further land at Newcastle, this time from Peter Crebert, a wine merchant, whose daughter Elizabeth would later marry Charles's eldest son, John. Upfold's company called for tenders for the building of a new works costing ¬£50,000, and the installation of machinery valued at a further ¬£83,000, on a twenty two acres site at Port Waratah, close to the Ferndale Colliery at Tighe's Hill, whence cheap coal was expected. The soap making equipment was the 'newest American' but English manufacturers had supplied the candle making plant. These works were the largest in Australia. A journalist wrote in 1886: \\"A representative of this journal called at the Tighe's Hill Soap Works on Saturday last to see what progress was being made. There are four distinct departments: 1. The manufacture of soap ‚Äì toilet, household and soft, 2. Stearine and parafine candles, 3. Refining glycerine, 4. Making all kinds of lubricating oils and machinery grease. The soap department is very nearly in full swing. Toilet soap was started last Saturday. Large quantities of candles are being turned out, which have to be pronounced up to the highest standard, imported or colonial. Preparations are in full swing for exhibiting the works in the fullest manner on the occasion of Lord & Lady Carrington's visit. At the Wickham works plant is being erected for the manufacture of blue, blacking and grocer's sundries. Altogether, this is one of the most gigantic undertakings of its kind in Australia.\\"Newcastle Morning Herald, 23 March 1886. He eventually controlled the colony's largest soap industry ‚Äì The Sydney Soap and Candle Company, in which John Ambrose Kitchen, who had a small factory at Melbourne, had a minority interest, was registered 25 July 1885. As the name implies, the registered office, along with a smaller factory at Botany, was at Sydney, the capital city of the colony, but the biggest works by far were at Tighes Hill, Newcastle. Probably their most famous product, one which stood the test of time, was Siren soap, which was later renamed Velvet. It was still being marketed in N.S.W., by Unilever in the latter part of the 20th century. Many argued that it was superior to Lever Bros famous Sunlight soap. In the 1888 Official Post Office Directory for New South Wales, Newcastle District, (p. 424), there appears \\"Upfold, Charles, soap factory\\". On 6 April 1895 the Newcastle Morning Herald carried a large article entitled \\"Departure of Mr Charles Upfold ‚Äì Citizen's Send-off\\". Charles was about to depart for England, Europe and America, and a large function was given in his honour at the Centennial Hotel in Newcastle, with an impressive guest list of local worthies. He returned from that overseas trip at the end of September and another large article describing his tour appeared in the same newspaper on 3 October 1895. In 1895 the Port Waratah works employed over 500 people. In 1898 his son, Robert Wallace Upfold, now manager of the soap & candle factory, was married to Clara, daughter of John Scholey, (a local landowner and colliery proprietor from Leeds; described in the 1901 Federal Directory as a \\"gentleman\\"). Charles Upfold, the father, is described on the certificate as \\"Managing Director ‚Äì Soap Works\\". Robert had a residence in Woodstock Street, North Waratah, and the 1901 Federal Directory of Newcastle & District records him as a \\"manufacturer\\". On 21 October 1899, Charles Upfold was mentioned as being on the committee of the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce.The Daily Telegraph, Sydney, 21 October 1899, p.10. The late professor John Turner wrote: \\"the modern technology and large scale of the Sydney Soap and Candle Company made it the outstanding industrial establishment of its kind. Upfold had wide experience of colonial conditions and constructed his Port Waratah works on recent British and American lines, in a location which gave unequalled access to tallow and coal.\\" He appears to have taken an additional interest in mining. In 1897 he was part of a syndicate which was proposing to purchase a gold mine at Barraba, New South Wales.Newcastle Morning Herald, Thursday, 22 April 1897, p.5. In 1904 he was also a Director (along with his friend John Scholey) of Aberdare Collieries Co.Ltd., and the Chairman of the board of management for its railways.The Daily Telegraph, Sydney, 30 April 1904, p.10. On 2 September 1899 he left Sydney on board the Oceanic Steamship Company's RMS Alameda for Samoa to arrange for purchases of shipments of copra.Newcastle Morning Herald, Tuesday 5 September 1899, p.4. Civic, family, and death In 1871 Charles Upfold was an Alderman on the Wickham Municipal Council, Newcastle.Newcastle Morning Herald, Thursday, 29 June 1871, p.2. and he was still there in 1878 when he held Tighe's Hill Ward.Newcastle Morning Herald, 21 January and 28 March 1878, p.2.

In March 1893 Upfold and his eldest son Robert contracted serious food poisoning after eating tinned meat on a picnic. They were reported as being in a \\"very bad way\\" in Newcastle Hospital.The Australian Star, Sydney, Monday, 6 March 1893, p.3. In 1899 he is mentioned as a Vice-President of the Newcastle Agricultural, Horticultural, and Industrial Association (Patron, Lord Beauchamp), more commonly known as the Newcastle Show Society, when it was negotiating with the Australian Agricultural Company for land for a showground.The Daily Telegraph, Sydney, Thursday, 20 April 1899, p.6. On 26 February 1900 Upfold laid the Foundation Stone of the Tighe's Hill School of Arts, Newcastle. The stone remains in situ today. He was involved in the Victoria Theatre Company which erected, in 1890, Newcastle's first theatre of an international standard. For many years he was also a member of the committee of the Newcastle Jockey Club.Newcastle Morning Herald Obituary, Saturday 15 March 1919 p.7. Charles Upfold built a large mansion on a piece of land in Crebert Street, North Waratah (now Mayfield), given to him by his friend John Scholey. It was later sold to the famous biscuit manufacturer William Arnott who sold it in 1898 to Isaac Winn, owner of the big Newcastle department store. It is today a home for the aged, owned by the Methodist Church. Charles Upfold subsequently purchased a small estate, 'Orange Grove', near Raymond Terrace, containing extensive orchards, vineyards, and a dairy farm,Evening News, Sydney, Saturday 28 November 1891, p.7. where he built another fine country residence.Sydney Evening News, Saturday 28 November 1891, p.7. He subsequently retired and moved to Chatswood, Sydney, where he died.Newcastle Morning Herald, Obituary, Saturday 15 March 1919, p.7. Upfold and his wife, Sarah Ann Temperance (n√©e Blundell) (b. 1843, Finchley Common, ‚Äì d.1921, Cronulla, Sydney) had ten children: four sons and six daughters.NSW Registry of Births Deaths & Marriages, Sydney, Death Certificates list all children living and deceased. Following his death the Upfold shares were bought by Lever Bros who were busy acquiring the paid up capital of Kitchen & Co., of Melbourne, Victoria, who had merged during The Great War with the Sydney Soap & Candle Co. John H. Kitchen, Managing Director of the Sydney Soap & Candle Company, testified in an Inquiry in Sydney on Friday 7 December 1917 that in 1914 Lever Brothers in England had acquired one-fifth of the company shares.Newcastle Morning Herald, Saturday 8 Dec 1917, p.6. This new amalgamated firm later became Lever & Kitchen.'The Story of John Ambrose Kitchen' in the Unilever Australia Reporter, September 1956, pps:20/23. Eventually, Levers gained full control & dropped the 'Kitchen' altogether. With the decline in candle-making, the Sino-Japanese war (much of Charles Upfold's exports went to China ‚Äì he had warehouses in Canton and his son Robert spoke Cantonese), coupled with the now ageing plant, the Newcastle factory was closed down just before World War II, a great blow to the city.The date of closure is unclear. It was still operating in January 1939. Newcastle Morning Herald, 20 Jan 1939, p.10. A new factory for the Australian Wire Rope Works was built upon its site. A very long street in the suburb of Mayfield is named Upfold Street after the great man himself. Although buried in the Gore Hill Congregational Cemetery, Sydney, his funeral service was conducted by a Church of England minister, Rev. Alfred G.Perkins.Death Certificate. There were numerous notices and obituaries in the newspapers following his death.Sydney Morning Herald, Monday 17 March 1919, p.10.Newcastle Morning Herald, Saturday 15 March 1919, p.7.The Maitland Daily Mercury, Friday 14 March 1919, p.5.

Eurotel was founded in 1990 as a joint venture between SPT Telecom (51%) and the American joint venture Atlantic West (initially between US WEST International, Inc. and Bell Atlantic International Inc.; later acquired by AT&T; Wireless and Verizon). At launch, it received an exclusive five-year licence to operate a public data network and a 20-year licence for the 450 MHz band to operate an analogue NMT mobile phone network and also, automatically, a right to buy a licence to the future GSM network. The name Eurotel was used for the Czechoslovak network. After the country's division in 1993, the company also separated into a Slovak Eurotel Bratislava and a Czech Eurotel Praha. The Slovak branch was rebranded to Telekom (formerly T-mobile) in 2005, the Czech branch to O2 in 2006.

The school was established in 1984, as a non-selective school and currently caters for approximately 880 students from Year K to Year 12. History Georges River Grammar was founded in 1984, initially as a primary school based at St Paul's Anglican Church in Bankstown. In 1986, a secondary school, Bankstown Grammar School was commenced as a joint venture of the Anglican and Uniting churches in Bankstown. In 1988, the Uniting Church withdrew from the partnership and the Bankstown Grammar School became an independent, coeducational, Anglican school. The name of the school was officially changed in early 2011 from Bankstown Grammar School to Georges River Grammar to reflect the reality that it draws broadly from the Georges River area, and that the school had outgrown its local name and drawing area of Bankstown.Bugg, Laura, and Nicole Gurran. \\"Urban planning process and discourses in the refusal of Islamic Schools in Sydney, Australia.\\" Australian planner 48, no. 4 (2011): 281-291. It also reflected a unified identity after the amalgamation of St Paul's Choir School and Bankstown Grammar School in 2004. According to researchers, the school's outgrowing of its local area is a pattern common with religious and other independent schools in Australia, as growing enrolment in Australian non- government schools confirm that parental desire to provide the ‚Äòbest‚Äô schooling for their children will often override factors such as the school location. The school currently has four houses ‚Äì Wood, Jackson, Rossiter and Chamberlain ‚Äì named for the founders of the school. Previously, it had six ‚Äì Wood, Jackson, Rossiter, Chamberlain, Broughton and Barker. In the mid-1990s, the school participated in a psychological research study conducted on the topic of self-concept. 395 students participated in the research.Marsh, H. (1994).

This decrease in vertical load on the rear tires causes a decrease in the lateral force they generate, so that their lateral acceleration (into the corner) is also decreased. This causes the vehicle to steer more tightly into the turn, hence oversteering. In other words, easing off the accelerator can cause the rear tires to lose traction, with the potential for the car to leave the road tail first. Dynamics The graphs to the right show the simulated effect of lifting off the throttle in the middle of a left turn. The transients in the first couple of seconds are due to the test, in which a step steer input (wheel angle) is applied at 0 s and held constant throughout. The steady state cornering is at constant speed, with a lateral acceleration of 0.45 g approximately until the throttle is released at 6 s. The yaw rate plot shows the oversteer due to the rear wheels losing traction - after an uncomfortable jerk at 20 deg/s, the vehicle spins sharply in the direction of the turn. The lateral acceleration also spikes to 0.6 g and levels at about 0.55 g, meaning that the radius decreased (i.e., the turn tightened). The side forces on the outside wheels increase and the inside rear (LR) wheel even lifts off the ground, a common occurrence. Snap oversteer is induced when the throttle is lifted while midway through a corner (lift-off oversteer), often by inexperienced drivers trying to reduce speed after braking too little. Moment of inertia Snap oversteer is most common with mid-mounted engine, rear wheel drive (MR) vehicles. Mid-mounted engine vehicles have a much lower rotational inertia than vehicles with a front-mounted or rear-mounted engine. The lower rotational inertia of mid-mounted engine vehicles causes the vehicle to spin much faster than a front or rear mounted engine vehicle. If unexpected, it can catch the driver off guard when cornering, ultimately leading to loss of control of the vehicle. Recovery As in all situations where the vehicle experiences loss of rear tire traction on the road surface, the proper maneuver to recover is to turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction of the spin (Countersteering). e.g. If the front of the vehicle is spinning to the left, countersteering to the right will help recover control. More specifically aiming the wheels in the desired direction of travel. In the case of a very violent spin the safest thing to do is turn the wheel so the tires are pointing straight forward with respect to the vehicle. This is often easier to accomplish for inexperienced/panicked drivers.Belknap pg 46 In popular culture In the 1940s, the Nazis described the Skoda 15A automobile as the Czech secret weapon due to its treacherous and deadly lift-off oversteer handling characteristics. Attorney and consumer protection activist Ralph Nader described this type of handling in his 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed. Lift-off oversteer is often exploited in motorsportparticularly on loose surfaces (e.g. in rallying)as a method of cornering faster as, when controlled, it has the effect of turning the nose into the apex and the car slightly sideways which allows early application of power on exiting the corner. Formula One driver Jim Clark's late-braking technique exploited the lift-off oversteer characteristics of mid-engined race cars to attain higher cornering speeds. It became standard competition driving technique as an enhancement of the four wheel drift technique that preceded it. The 1989-1999 Toyota MR2 (SW20) is notorious for snap oversteer characteristics, after initial liftoff oversteer, when improper steering inputs were made attempting to correct this non-power-on oversteer, the rear of the MR2 would swing one way, then wildly (and quickly) the other. On April 10, 2010, Consumer Reports magazine rated the 2010 Lexus GX 460 SUV a \\"Don‚Äôt Buy: Safety Risk,\\" as their panel of test engineers determined the vehicle was subject to excessive lift- off oversteer during a standardized evaluation for emergency handling. The test simulates scenarios such as transiting a highway exit ramp while traveling with excessive speed. On April 19, Toyota recalled the GX 460 and the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado for a software update to the electronic stability control to correct the issue.

Personality Godfrey was born in 1871, and is a gentle, mild-mannered and kindly old gentleman, though more complex than at first evident. He is the only member of the platoon who has retired. In the episode \\"Branded\\" it is revealed that he was a conscientious objector in the First World War. This revelation initially makes him a pariah. However, during a training exercise, he risks his life to rescue Captain Mainwaring. Later, his sister reveals to the platoon that, far from avoiding service, he earned the Military Medal during the Battle of the Somme, where he served with distinction as a stretcher bearer with the Royal Army Medical Corps, and heroically saved several men's lives while under fire, an accomplishment he plays down modestly. This earns him the respect of the platoon, and leads to him being appointed as First Aid supervisor.Webber, Perry, Croft, p.36 Arnold Ridley actually served during the First World War with the Somerset Light Infantry, and fought in the Battle of the Somme, where he was severely wounded.Webber, Perry, Croft, p.179 These injuries gave a practical reason for his role: it was much easier for Ridley to carry the first aid bag than a heavy rifle. Godfrey is a long-standing friend of Sergeant Wilson, and in the episode \\"High Finance\\" he lends Wilson a large sum of money when Mrs Pike is blackmailed by Hodges. He lives in picturesque Cherry Tree Cottage with his hard-of-hearing spinster sisters, Dolly and Cissy. He is clearly very fond of them, and often brings them up in conversation. When provisions are needed, his sister Dolly often provides upside-down cakes.Webber, Perry, Croft, p.81 He is immensely loyal to Captain Mainwaring, who often feels quite guilty whenever he has criticised Godfrey: :Mainwaring: \\"If you're not fit for active service, perhaps you shouldn't come at all.\\" :Godfrey: \\"I didn't want to disappoint you, sir.\\" :Mainwaring: \\"Well done Godfrey.\\" ::from the episode \\"Everybody's Trucking\\".

An aspect of his old age is his weak bladder, which lets him down and postpones all platoon activity, hence his catchphrase, \\"May I be excused, sir?\\", and his tendency to fall asleep can be similarly categorised: \\"I must have dropped off!\\".Webber, Perry, Croft, p.81.

Web. http://www.istanbul.com/en/explore/info/constitutional-period-in-the-ottoman- empire The era ended with the suspension of the Ottoman Parliament and the constitution by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, with which he restored his own absolute monarchy. The first constitutional era did not include any party system. At the time, the Ottoman Parliament (known as the General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire) was seen as the voice of the people but not as a venue for the formation of political parties and organizations. The elections for the Parliament were held in accordance with the provisional electoral regulations. The Parliament (General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire; ) was composed in two stages. The lower house of the bicameral legislature was the Chamber of Deputies (), while the upper house was the Senate (). The initial selection of deputies was made by administrative councils in the provinces (also called \\"Meclis-i Umumi\\"). After the establishment of the General Assembly in the provinces, the members selected the deputies from within the assembly to form the Chamber of Deputies in the capital. The Chamber had 115 members and reflected the distribution of the millets in the empire. In the second elections, there were 69 Muslim millet representatives and 46 representatives of other millets (Jews, Phanariotes, Armenians). The second body was the Senate, and the members were selected by the Sultan. The Senate had only 26 members. It was designed to replace the porte, and the Grand Vizier become the speaker of Senate. The two elections happened between 1877 and 1878. First term, 1877 Ziya Pasha, member of the first Ottoman Parliament. The members' reactions to the approaching war were very strong, and Sultan Abdul Hamid II asked for new elections citing the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878). Second term, 1878 Vaso Pasha, member of the first Ottoman Parliament. The life of the second term of the parliament was merely a few days, as after the initial speeches by the members from Balkan vilayets, Abdul Hamid II closed the parliament, citing social unrest.

He is of Afghan Japanese heritage. While he is inherently Japanese due to his name, Sagara grew up in Helmajistan, a region in Afghanistan that was caught up in political strife. At age 8, he joined a guerrilla movement to survive, and was eventually recruited by Mithril. Sousuke only knows military life and as a result he does not handle the everyday occurrences of civilian life very well. He also has a tough time integrating into high school life as his social skills are not quite up to par. His military bearing and encyclopedic knowledge of weapons earns him the nickname 'Military Maniac'. The basic problem this causes is, for instance, how he blows up the shoes lockers if there is any clue that someone has tampered with them. Sousuke can be quite insensitive at times, for example in volume 7 he bought a pregnancy test while out with Kaname and did not understand what was wrong, though his intentions are always in the right place. His deep feelings for Chidori Kaname are unavoidably clear by the beginning of TSR when he punches his fist through a laptop with the message of his direct order to not contact her anymore. Sousuke eventually decides to give up his life as a soldier and retires from Mithril, deciding that he wanted to be with Chidori instead. Upon his return, Sousuke confirms his feelings for Chidori and the two share a kiss in the school court yard. Also, he was formerly known as 'Kashim' according to Gauron. Kaname Chidori is the heroine of the series. She is often described as, 'The kind of girl everyone looks up to, but not even a boy wants as their girlfriend', as a fellow male student put it. She's very much the loud mouth, speak your mind kind of girl; a trait she picked up when she studied abroad in the United States. Until then, she feels like she must protect Sousuke from the harsh, cruel world of high school - a place where he doesn't quite fit. Sousuke is assigned to guard her as she is one of the \\"Whispered\\". People that have in their subconscious very technologically advanced knowledge that numerous governments and other groups want to use for their own means. She often uses a paper fan to hit Sousuke, besides berating him on how the kinds of weapons he uses are not exactly proper for a high school student. While she criticizes Sousuke for being too militaristic and overprotective, she appreciates it under life or death situations. Chidori develops serious feelings for Sousuke and is dejected when he is so obtuse in such matters. Eventually Chidori confesses her love to Sousuke and the latter reciprocates it. Teresa \\"Tessa\\" Testarossa is the Captain of the Mithril's submarine Tuatha de Danaan. She is a young girl of 16 who has a crush on Sousuke and bears the weight of Mithril's mission - to make the world safer by destroying terrorist organizations and drug facilities. Tessa is young, and therefore, hasn't lost that optimism that she can make a difference. She is also stubborn and will try her hardest to prove wrong those who tell her she can't do something. Still, most of her crew sees her as weak and frail - someone who never got her hands dirty on the battle field and therefore can't defend herself. Kurz Weber Kurz first appears to your typical lady's man, yet he is often the one giving Sousuke advice about life and love. He's a laid back kind of guy who won't dodge responsibility if it comes his way, and is one of the finest snipers in Mithril. Kurz is shot down by his mentor Casper in Volume 13 of the Manga. Later on it was found out that he survived. Melissa Mao is the superior officer of both Sousuke and Kurz and demands respect for her role. She is also a spunky woman who loves beer, smokes a lot, and wishes she could be free spirited and optimistic like Tessa. She was originally a member of the Marines, signing her recruitment contract on the day she was supposed to marry a businessman her father had pushed onto her. Eventually, she left the Marines and joined Mithril, where she met Kurz and Sousuke as new recruits. The two were downplaying their skills intentionally, Kurz pretending to be a terrible shot and Sousuke purposefully scoring low on written exams. Eventually, she realized what they were doing and picked them out of the camp to be her new teammates. Gauron is Full Metal Panic's main antagonist. He's an especially twisted and violent mercenary deeply involved in the black market and global terrorism. Despite possessing an extremely vile personality, his ruthless cunning and mastery of the Lambda Drive system make him a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. In combat, his vehicle of choice is the super AS called Venom. Mithril  Andrei Sergeivich Kalinin Andrei Sergeivich Kalinin () is Sagara's commanding officer and one of Tessa's military strategists with the rank of Lieutenant Commander, fulfilling the role of Operations Director. He is also the foster father of Sagara. He and Sousuke were once enemies, as mentioned in a two-part episode by Sagara himself. The foster father status may be on the school's official papers only but Kalinin is certainly a very fatherly figure to Sagara. Kalinin was formerly of the Soviet special forces - Spetsnaz - and was the leader of the team that found a crashed Japanese airliner. There was only one survivor: a three-year-old child by the name of Sagara Sousuke. His wife is deceased Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid OVA and the whereabouts and status of the rest of his family is unknown. There is speculation that Kalinin has betrayed Mithril to Amalgam, due to his meeting with Leonard Testarossa at the end of the book 'Dancing Very Merry Christmas' and also due to his mysterious disappearance and attitude during the raid by Amalgam on M√©rida Island. Kalinin later appears in 'Tsudou Make My Day' at Leonard's villa, apparently as one of Leonard's subordinates. He later shoots Leonard in the chest before Leonard could detonate the TARTAROS system along with M√©rida Island. In a final knife-battle with Sousuke, he is mortally wounded by Sousuke just before the nuclear missile hits the island. Kalinin mentioned that he had difficulty maintaining family ties, mostly with his wife, due to his time spent with the Spetsnaz. He seems to be of a family man sort and loves his wife so much that he made the Borscht (that Sousuke avoids at all costs) that his wife made him as he returns from missions.Andrei: \\"My wife and I were often at odds over the amount of time I would have to spend away from home on missions.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid OVA) He operates under the codename Perth 1.Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid MITHRIL Report included on Volume 3 (Act III, Scece 10 + 11) Richard Mardukas Richard Mardukas is an overly protective aide of Tessa's who insists on guarding her with his life. He holds the rank of Commander and is in charge of Mithril's TDD-1 when the Captain, Testarossa, is not on board; appropriate, given that Mardukas' position is that of Executive Officer. Mardukas is often seen wearing a hat bearing the name of HMS Turbulent, a real British submarine. Prior to joining Mithril, Mardukas was the Commanding Officer of HMS Turbulent, and a graduate & instructor of the Royal Navy's \\"Perisher\\" course: the submarine equivalent to the US Navy's famed \\"Top Gun\\" Fighter Weapons School. According to the FMP novel A Dancing Very Merry Christmas, Mardukas was known to the submarine community as a genius of submarine warfare, leading to his nickname \\"Duke\\"; he also served on HMS Conqueror when it sank the General Belgrano, and while commanding the Turbulent saved Tessa's father and his submarine on a secret mission. Many of his peers in the submarine community, such as Commander Killy B. Sailor, CO of the USS Pasadena, believe Mardukas to be working in a shipping firm after his retirement. A running gag throughout the series is that he usually ends up giving sermons to lower officers on deck. Belfangan Clouseau (Ben) SRT team's current team leader, callsign Urzu-1, first appearance in the novel 'End of Day By Days' and the 2nd anime series Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, replacing Captain Gail McAllen after his death near the end of the novel 'Rocking into The Blue' (and subsequently, the 1st anime series). Pilot of the M9D Falke and was a part of MITHRIL's Mediterranean Sea Fleet.Belfangan: \\"I come to you fresh from the Mediterranean Sea Fleet. Lieutenant Belfangan Closeau. (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 8: Jungle Groove) His first introduction into the team was kind of unorthodox, ticking off Kurz Weber and Sousuke Sagara by saying McAllen was a coward after sitting on the chair he used to sit on while in reality, McAllen was one of his most trusted teammates and a good friend.Belfangan: \\"No one needs to know that McAllen and I used to be war buddies.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 8: Jungle Groove) Proved himself to be an expert martial artist by incapacitating Kurz with just one move In the TSR OVA, Closeau is an expert in melee combat when he uses a broom stick to block a projectile from Kurz's single shot grenade pistol. and defeating Sousuke and the Arbalest during the 'test' which he conducted. He also proved to be a capable leader when he made Sousuke understand why he lost and told him that it wasn't his skill as they were actually evenly matched in that aspect but rather his hatred for the Arbalest Belfangan: \\"Skill doesn't have a thing to do with it. You have a problem that's going to kill you unless you deal with it.\\" Sousuke: \\"Oh really, what do you know?\\" Belfangan: \\"Well, it's obvious to me that you hate the Arbalest. I can see it as soon as we started. In your footwork, in your mechanics, and in every single one of your attacks. You were rushing your moves, full of self-doubt.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 8: Jungle Groove) and tells him that an Arm Slave is like a part of their own bodies.Belfangan: \\"Sagara, listen. The AS system that we use is more than just a lifeless machine. A properly trained soldier makes it an extension of his entire body. And your ability to handle it says a great deal about you. And when the stakes are highest, your lack of heart will get you killed.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 8: Jungle Groove) Since then Kurz and him don't really see eye-to-eye, though they have developed a grudging respect for each other's abilities. It is also known that he & Melissa Mao have known each other since way back. His nickname from Mao was 'Ben'. He was also one of the few remaining survivors of the attack on Melida island, along with Melissa Mao, Kurz Weber, Richard Mardukas, Teletha Testarossa and most of the crew of the Tuatha de Danaan at the end of the novel 'Continuing on My Own'. In the TSR OVA, it is revealed that he is an anime otaku in his spare time. His surname is also known as Grouseaux.This is only used from Japanese anime sources. In the Ending of Day by Days novel, Belfangan states to the bartender in M√©rida Island that he was a Muslim. Vincent Bruno An American Melissa (Disguise): \\"I guess you're American, aren't you?\\" Vincent: \\"So how do you know that?\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 5: Beautiful Sicily) MITHRIL officer in Intelligence with the rank of Captain, he was supposedly responsible for communications maintenance in the Nanjing hostage rescue operation.In Full Metal Panic Sigma, a woman who had the same surname Bruno was the Secretary of MITHRIL's Human Relations Department, who was indirectly responsible for the TDD-1 incident. However, she was in Sicily hiding in her father's mansion, unlike Vincent's relation with Barbara, who was his friend. Also, the woman was portrayed as a lesbian. He, however, leaked it to Gates and several Amalgam commandos, using the information to ambush SRT/PRT members, killing some of them. In return, Admiral Borda allowed a snatch operation to take place, which resulted in his capture and some strains in the relationship between the Tactical and Intelligence divisions.Admiral Borda: \\"But it seems like that they're bent out of shape that we went in and got him without their say-so.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 6: Edge of Heaven.) During his interrogation in Sydney, Vincent confesses that Amalgam had hired him to botch the Nanjing operation.Vincent: \\"All they said was they were from... Amalgam, yeah, Amalgam!\\" Interrogator: \\"Amalgam?\\" Vincent: \\"They didn't let me in on any more than that.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 6: Edge of Heaven.) He previously operated under the codename Ogma-1. His surname can also be spelt as Blueno. Vincent speaks Italian aside from English.See Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 5: Beautiful Sicily. Gavin Hunter A supposed native of Hong Kong and an officer in MITHRIL Intelligence's Hong Kong division, he was responsible for providing tactical support for Melissa, Sousuke and other SRT/PRT personnel deployed in Hong Kong to locate a rogue Amalgam Codarl Arm Slave that went berserk in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Gavin is also married and has a family.Ending Day by Days novel. He's known to the Hong Kong public as a businessman with multiple businesses in operation, such as the Hunter Cleaning Company Ltd. that Gavin used when he provided Melissa's squad with Hunter Cleaning Company Ltd. Toyota Hiace vans and uniforms to infiltrate Hong Kong and Kowloon without being caught by the North and South Chinese army and police.Melissa: \\"Man. Hunter sure has his hand on a lot of businesses around here.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 10: Two Hong Kongs) He can be considered to be MITHRIL's humor character as Gates is to Amalgam's since he always smile and almost never gets angry, except when he was instructed by General Amit to cease Intelligence operations in Hong Kong territory.See Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 11: His Issues. Nora Lemming An engineer based in M√©rida Island with the rank of Second Lieutenant,In the Full Metal Panic: The Anime Mission Fan book, it said that Nora's rank was ensign. Nora has worked on the Lambda Driver, particularly on its potential continuous application after MITHRIL realizes that Amalgam's Arm Slaves has the ability to continuously use their own Lambda Driver. Previously, Nora had conducted some studies on the Chodarl Arm Slave when it was captured from Gauron. She is a graduate of MIT and was responsible for the Arbalest after Bunny Morauta had died. It is hinted at in the novels that she is in an intimate relationship with Lieutenant Commander Kalinin. Jerome Borda The leader of Mithril's Operations department with the rank of admiral. He was the one to order Sousuke to give up his position as a high school student at Jindai High in The Second Raid and the book 'The End by Day by Day'. He is presumed dead after an explosion rocked through Operations Headquarters in Sydney following the beginning of Amalgam's attack on Mithril, however it was eventually revealed he survived and is intending to rebuild Mithril. Borda is intended to be an homage to the late Admiral Jeremy Michael Boorda, the 25th Chief of Naval Operations of the US Navy. His surname can also be spelt as Boda or Voda. Tessa calls him \\"Uncle Jerry\\" in the Second Raid, hinting Borda's familiarity with Tessa and her family as Borda was the superior to Tessa's late father.Tessa: \\"I apologize, uncle. Everyone here is important to me. I can't consider leaving.\\" Admiral Borda: \\"If Leonard were here, I think that he would probably take half of the responsibility that you're feeling right off your shoulders.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 5: Beautiful Sicily). Roy Seals A retired NAVSPECWAR officer, Seals was one of the founding members of Mithril. His role in the organization is unknown, but he was one of the few members of Mithril's inner circle to survive assassination. He acquires an M6A3 Dark Bushnell, a USSOCOM M6, for Sousuke to use in his assault on Leonard's lair. Sousuke describes Seals as \\"...like Kurz, fifty years old, and more perverted.\\" Mayer Amit The leader of Mithril's Intelligence department with the rank of General and of Israeli descent. He was the one to order Wraith to discreetly observe and passively protect Kaname Chidori. Before joining MITHRIL, Mayer was supposedly a top agent for Mossad. Wraith Voiced by: Sayaka Ohara (Japanese, real voice); Christopher Ayres (voice changer), Elizabeth Maxwell (real voice) (English) A North Korean ex-spy, who is also a master of disguise. As a member of the Intelligence Department, she was ordered to watch Kaname and protect her from serious threats. Although appearing cold at first, following her 'rescue' by Kaname from Leonard Testarossa, she has opened up slightly and secretly meets with Kaname. She also saved Sousuke and Kyoko's lives from Amalgam members on the Jindai High School rooftop and aided in the defusing of the bomb planted on Kyoko. She even went as far to perform emergency surgery on Kyoko after a piece of shrapnel embedded itself inside her diaphragm and then took her to the hospital. Showing further compassion, she also allowed Kaname Chidori to give herself up to Leonard so Sousuke's life would be spared, despite violating her orders. After the events in \\"Continue On My Own\\", she is still helping Mithril, helping Gavin Hunter to complete the construction of ARX-8 Laevatein at the end of the novel 'Burning One Man Force', and has actually helped to transport the completed Laevatein to Sousuke in the progress of \\"Get Together and Make My Day\\". Though serious about her duties, she seems to enjoy making Sousuke react by putting him on edge, like pointing a laser sight at Kagurazaka-sensei as \\"revenge\\" for having to watch over Kaname during the winter while Sousuke gets to stay indoors. Lord Mallory The current head of MITHRIL's General Council. He is also responsible for overseeing MITHRIL's day-to-day operations. During the Second Raid series, he was the one who gave the order to MITHRIL officers to devise anti-infiltration countermeasures when he learned of Vincent Bruno's defection after the Nanking disaster. Based on his mannerisms, his clothing (monocle on right eye) and his title, it is safe to assume that Lord In the Ending Day by Days novel, his title was also addressed as Earl. Mallory is of British descent. Amalgam  Leonard Testarossa A child prodigy and Whispered like his younger twin sister, Teletha, he is known as \\"Mr. Silver\\" in the executive circle of the Amalgam organization. He also claims to be in love with Kaname Chidori, and has earned her contempt by stealing her first kiss.See Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 9: Her Issues. In The Second Raid he is chaperoned by two miniature ASs. It is speculated that his special Whispered knowledge has allowed the creation of the Codarl and Codarl-m (Mithril codename Venom) type AS types (as Bunny Murata was to the Arbalest), the miniature Alastor types and the Leviathan-type underwater fighter/AS hybrids. In the novel, Continuing On My Own, he is seen piloting the near invincible Belial type AS, and shows the strength of the machine and himself as a pilot by completely obliterating the Arbalest (Sousuke managed to survive with minor injuries),\\"Continuing On My Own\\" Novel and taking away Kaname. In Always, Stand By Me part II, Kalinin kills him before he can detonate the TARTAROS system along with M√©rida Island. Admiral Borda is familiar with him, aside from Tessa and their parents. However, Admiral Borda doesn't know about Leonard's ties to Amalgam.Admiral Borda: \\"If Leonard were here, I think that he would probably take half of the responsibility that you're feeling right off your shoulders. You know, I wonder what he's up to these days?\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 5: Beautiful Sicily). Xia Yu Lan A Chinese-born assassin, raised by Gauron alongside her twin sister Xia Yu Fan.In the novel version, the original role belonged to a boy named Fei Xiu. It's assumed that he was taken out during production of the Second Raid for fanservice. She and her elder sister, Xia Yu Fan, were ordered by Gauron to finish off Kaname Chidori in order to mentally break down Sousuke since Gauron knew that he was attached to her ever since Sousuke was assigned to be Kaname's bodyguard. Later in Japan, she was killed by Leonard's man-size Arm Slave bodyguard named Alastor by strangling her to death, her corpse being used by Gates to mock Xia Yu Fan. She wears a vest with red linings on it. Early on, Yu Lan raises her disgust with Gates, the earliest in Balic when Gates shoves the barrel of his CZ-75 pistol on her mouth when Yu Lan mocked his sympathy for a dead Amalgam commando when he shot him in the head without a second thought.See Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 2: Scenes Underwater. In combat, she used dual machetes. Aside from this, she is an expert in using throwing knives and is fairly proficient in the use of small arms. She is sixteen years old.Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid MITHRIL Report included on Volume 4, Scene 06+07 Xia Yu Fan Another Chinese-born assassin raised by Gauron and the \\"eldest\\" with the Xia siblings.In the novels, her role was done to replace a boy named Fei Won. Like Yu Lan, Yu Fan was in the Second Raid for fanservice. She and Xia Yu Lan were given the last orders by Gauron to finish off Kaname after being crippled by Sousuke's Arbalest. Yu Fan is a proficient Arm Slave pilot, using a Zy-98 Shadow Arm Slave before using a stolen Chodarl in central Hong Kong. However, she is also good in using small arms and is an expert in unarmed combat. She wears a trench coat with green linings on. In the last episode, Yu Fan reveals that the Xia siblings were at odds with Amalgam, mostly for wiping out their town in China during the Second Chinese Civil War.Xia Yu Fan: \\"I know that Amalgam has caused the civil war that destroyed our hometown.\\" (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 13: Continuing Day by Day) She is sixteen years old. Gates An original character for the television animation 'Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid'. He takes over the character Mr K from the light novels. An Amalgam agent and the head of Amalgam's Execution Squads,This was said by Gauron in Episode 12 of The Second Raid. Gates seems to have two personalities. He is known to kill his subordinates whenever he messes up an operation, hears that an Amalgam- sponsored mission is a failure and (for the most part) when he is angry. Gates kills through a variety of methods including shooting an Amalgam commando in the head when he back talked and crushing Xia Yu Fan's Shadow Arms Slave with extreme ferocity. He is also shown to be highly abusive of his subordinates with him kicking his second in command off a helicopter and nearly drowning him in a pool. Despite such brutality, Gates showed his intelligence by being able to deduce accurately the tactics that MITHRIL's Special Response Team utilised in their intervention of the Balic civil war. At one point, Gates began to sing Ave Maria while Xia Yu Lan and a group of Amalgam commandos began to kill every armed Balic soldier. One light side about Gates is that he is protective about himself, especially about being bald since the front of his head shows no hair present.Gates: \\"But helmets make you go... bald. (Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 3: The Dungeon and The Dragon.) Gates is killed by Sousuke when he uses the Arbalest's Lambda Driver in full power to defeat his Codarl Arm Slave. Gates is shown to be accepting of his fate by playing with a strand of his hair saying \\"Maybe I cut it too long?\\" while his machine was facing total destruction. It can be assumed that Gates was known as \\"Mr. Kalium\\" throughout Amalgam, as in the light novel, A Dancing Very Merry Christmas. It is said that Gauron (otherwise known as Mr. Iron) was responsible for the death of Mr. Kalium (Gauron does put into motion a series of events that end with Gates's death, though Gauron's only intention seems to have been to lure Sousuke to himself). It is shown that he is also a sexual deviant. He proves this by saying how even though Xia Yu Lan and Xia Yu Fan were underage he did not hold back to \\"satisfying\\" them as well as himself leading him to being a pedophile. He also calls them Lolita-kun (lolita is an unofficial term for a child in pornography) when taunting them for escaping. When he manages to acquire the body one of the girls it makes references to the idea that he will dabble in a spot of necrophilia with either or both of the girls bodies. In the same scene where he finds out that the girls have escaped, it depicts him being interrupted in the process of masturbating over the image of kittens on his wide screen TV. A truly twisted individual, that when concluding his communication with Xia Yu Lan and Xia Yu via his television he returns to his previous channel which is now depicting squirrels. It would seem that on top of pedophilia he has a penchant for bestiality, at least so far with small \\"cute\\" mammals. Gates can speak some Mandarin aside from English.See Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Episode 3: The Dungeon and The Dragon. Steven Harris A Caucasian man with a beard and captain of the ship, Pacific Chrysalis. However, he and some of the ship's personnel are secret agents of Amalgam. Mr. Gold Very little is known about this mysterious character yet, but it is assumed he is the leader of Amalgam. He activated Captain Steven Harris as an agent of Amalgam aboard the ship the Pacific Chrysalis. He also gave Harris the order to deploy the Alastors aboard the ship. Civilians (Jindai High)   Kyoko Tokiwa is Kaname's best friend, a humble and polite girl who wears glasses and has her hair tied in two pigtails. She tries to bring Kaname and Sousuke together, however impossible it may seem given Sagara's tendency to blow things up at whim. In the novel Continuing On My Own, she is held hostage by Amalgam's agents as bait to lure Sousuke so they could kill him and find Kaname. During the rescue attempt, Kyoko is seriously injured, but is saved by Wraith, and is later seen recovering in the hospital. Shinji Kazama is Sousuke's Arm Slave loving classmate. He shares the same amount of passion to AS as Sousuke and could be considered Sousuke's best school friend besides Kaname. His father is Shintaro Kazama and a secretary of Narashino's Assault Machine Troop. Shinji's love for AS began when his dad failed to become an AS pilot. As a result of his father's failure, Shinji strives to discover the result of the failure and to fulfill his father's dream of becoming a pilot. There is no indication as to what happened to his mother, but it's assumed that Shintaro is a widower before the series started.No further details are known as of 2007. Mizuki Inaba is a classmate of Chidori who initially blames her for having stolen her boyfriend. She becomes one of her closer friends later on in the series. Mizuki is easily infatuated with various men, who usually take an interest in Kaname instead. Eri Kagurazaka is an English teacher at Jindai High and is the class advisor to Sousuke, Kaname, Kyoko, Shinji and Mizuki at Class II-4. She is a kind and understanding teacher, who is willing to put the interest of her students over her own, as shown when she confronted Gauron and some North Korean secret agents over taking Kaname from her seat in the hijacked Boeing 747 in Sunan Air Base.In the Full Metal Panic anime, it takes place in a Khanka Air Force base. However, she's known to get a mean temper whenever she finds Sousuke to be responsible for disastrous things in the school (which she always is a victim of). Atsunobu Hayashimizu is the president of the Jindai High's Student Council and a third year student. He is highly intelligent and seems to be able to deal with any situation - no matter how difficult. His behavior is always calm and he is never seen angry. He often considers Sousuke's behavior a reasonable response to the kind of situations he finds himself in, much to the frustration of Kaname. He assigns Sousuke to be the head of security in the Student Council, and Sousuke and Atsunobu share mutual respect for each other. On many occasions involving the school, Sousuke tends to treat Atsunobu just as he would a senior officer in the military, even to the point of calling him \\"Excellency\\" in the English dub. Atsunobu is also known for holding a white fan, on which various Japanese characters are written. In addition, he is seen reading famous books - Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's The Prince among them. As with the Japanese characters on his white fan, the books often change even within the same scene - a reference to his high intelligence and calm attitude that provides a comic aspect to the character. Atsunobu is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa in the original Japanese anime, by Christopher Ayres in the English dub. Ren Mikihara is the Secretary of Jindai High's Student Council, friend of Kaname's and daughter of a Yakuza boss. She is an example of Yamato Nadeshiko - Japanese ideal of femininity - and as such, she is beautiful, dependable and caring. She seems to have feelings for Atsunobu Hayashimizu, the Student Council's president. However, much about her is still unknown. Because women in the time of the Tokugawa shogunate were given names with two syllables only (usually adding the prefix \\"O-\\" to refer to someone of a higher social standing and considered an honorific), Kaname prefers to address her as Oren-san. She is voiced by Rie Tanaka in the original Japanese anime, by Nancy Novotny in the English version by ADV Films and by Julie Shields in the English dub of Invisible Victory by Funimation. Issei Tsubaki is the black belt leader of Jindai High's Karate Club. However, he is extremely nearsighted and can see clearly only when wearing his glasses, which leads to several comic incidents. His sense of pride cannot accept the fact that he was defeated by Sousuke and is constantly challenging him to rematches, which Sousuke usually avoids. He has a huge crush on Kaname and in the short story Irrelevant Emotion accidentally indicates Sousuke when confessing his love for her. In the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu anime, Mizuki falls in love with him in the last episode. In Irrelevant Emotion, however, she falls for him after he saves her from falling out of a window. He is voiced by Jun Fukuyama in the original Japanese anime, by Nomed Kaerf in the English version by ADV Films. Minor characters Kudan Mira is a whispered girl that Sousuke rescues right in the very beginning. When Mithril is destroyed, she goes into hiding along with Wraith and Hunter in Alaska. With the help of AL, the original AI system in the Arbalest, she builds the ARX-8 Laevatein. In the novel translation she is called Sarah Miller. She is voiced by Shiho Kikuchi in Japanese. Seina Seina joined terrorist organization A21 a long time ago when it was a refuge for delinquents. Now that the world has turned against her, she uses anyone close to her to aid her in revenge - complete destruction. She is voiced by Mayumi Asano in Japanese, Kelli Cousins in English. Takuma Kugayama Takuma is the unstable experiment of the terrorist organization, A21. All he wants out of life is to please who he thinks is his big sister, Seina, (since he killed his actual one) but she's been scarred and vowed revenge against society long ago. Now, the only thing that seems to please her is Takuma piloting the mech, Behemoth, and wreaking as much havoc as possible. He is voiced by Susumu Chiba in Japanese, Spike Spencer in English. Zaied When Sousuke joined a guerrilla movement at age 8, he was befriended by Zaied, who was only 3 years older. Zaied became his mentor and taught him the art of combat and survival. He was later believed by Sousuke to have been killed by a raid made by Gauron on the guerilla village. Eight years later, it is revealed that he had instead teamed up with Gauron to deliver a nuclear warhead, and Sousuke meets him again during his mission to assassinate Gauron. He is voiced by Takehito Koyasu in Japanese, Illich Guardiola in English. Commander Killy B. Sailor Commanding Officer of the US Navy attack submarine USS Pasadena, Sailor crosses paths with Mithril twice: first, during Gauron's hijack of Tuatha de Danaan, he launches torpedoes at TDD-1 in retaliation for Gauron's missile strike on the USS Bunker Hill. Secondly, during the events of the novel Dancing Very Merry Christmas, Sailor is a passenger aboard the Pacific Chrysalis when Amalgam activates Harris and a force of Alastors. What little is known about him is that he was an enlisted Chief Petty Officer who served with Tessa's father, who encouraged him to enter OCS. He holds Mardukas in high regard, having met him in the incident where Turbulent saved them. His Codename is \\"McClane\\". References Category:Full Metal Panic! Full Metal Panic!

The club stages a diverse range of productions every term, many of them at the fully equipped ADC Theatre in Park Street, where they are the resident company. They also regularly stage shows at other Cambridge venues, annually at the Edinburgh Fringe and occasionally on tour abroad. History The Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club was officially founded during the Easter Vacation of 1855 by F.C. Burnand and a group of his friends, who had acquired back rooms in the Hoop Hotel on Jesus Lane during the course of the previous year. The university‚Äôs response to the project was reported to have been ‚Äòunfavourable‚Äô, but this did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of those involved. The club‚Äôs first presentation was a series of short one act plays of varying quality, of which the club‚Äôs first minute book reports that ‚Äòthe receipts were scanty, but a start was effected‚Äô. Over the course of the next five years, the society grew slowly but steadily. A contribution of ¬£5 from each of the club‚Äôs members allowed the club to pay for the renovation of their cramped and bare rooms, and in 1860 the new stage at the Hoop Hotel, roughly on the site of the current building, was opened. Though the university‚Äôs approval was initially begrudging, attitudes towards the club changed over the course of the next 40 years, and by the beginning of the 20th century the club was a nationally renowned and respected group. Tragedy struck in 1933 when the Hoop Hotel stage was destroyed in a fire. Support flooded in, including messages of goodwill from the King, and a mere 18 months later a new building was opened by the club. The ADC Theatre, now the oldest university playhouse in the country, was reborn. The club continued to run the theatre until it ran into financial difficulties in 1974 when the university took over the running of the theatre, as a department of the university leasing the building from the club for a nominal annual fee.A Potted History of the ADC Theatre Activities The CUADC puts on around 20 shows every year. These cover a huge range of subject matter and playwrights, from comic to tragic, from Chaucer to Stoppard via Shakespeare and Beckett to name just a few. Although many are performed at the 228-seater ADC Theatre, where the club is the resident performing company, recent venues have also included the Corpus Christi Playroom, The Octagon at St Chad‚Äôs, King's College Lawn and the Round Church. Constitutionally, the club also has an obligation > to spread interest in the theory and practice of theatre, in all its > aspects, by every possible means amongst those qualified to be members of > the Club; to encourage the active involvement of the same regardless of > previous experience; and to maintain interest in the running of the ADC > Theatre. To this end, the club puts on a programme of professional and student-run workshops for actors, directors and technicians as well as a series of late- night experimental pieces known as One Night Stands. Membership Anybody aged 17 or over, studying for a qualification at the University of Cambridge, or who is engaged in full-time study at any other educational institution within Cambridge is eligible for ordinary membership.CUADC Constitution From time to time special membership may be conferred onto people who do not otherwise qualify for ordinary membership. It is a requirement that anybody participating in a show put on by the club must have some class of membership status for insurance reasons. Committee The club is run on behalf of its members by a committee of fourteen students of the university. The President usually must have been a member of the committee the previous year and is elected by that committee, all other roles are elected by club members at the AGM, held in Lent Term. The committee is in charge of show selection and support, as well as organisation of one-off events such as the annual garden party, annual dinner, and freshers' squash.

The temple is located in Palakollu of West Godavari in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Lord Shiva is known locally as Ksheera Ramalingeswara Swamy. The Sivalinga was established by Lord Vishnu. It is believed that staying one day in Kshirarama is equivalent to staying one year in Varanasi. It is one of the centrally protected monuments of national importance. It is one of the five powerful Shiva temples in Southern India that form the Pancharama Kshetram. The remaining four are Somarama Temple in Bhimavaram; Draksharama Temple in Draksharamam; Kumararama Temple in Samalkota; and Amararama Temple in Amaravati, state of Andhra Pradesh. Architecture The tower is one of the tallest among the temple towers in Andhra Pradesh. The height of the temple is 120 ft and 9 floors and was constructed during the Chalukya period (9th century) during the reign of Chalukya Bheema. The Shivaling is a unique milky white in colour and the tallest. There are 72 pillars made of black stone in the temple mandapa. Inside, the garbhalaya, Gokarneswara and Vigneswara alayas are at the left. Kshiralingam is in the center. To the right are Subramanya Swamy and Janardhana Swamy alayas; Nandi is at the centre. The Gostani River flows through Palakollu and there is a sangam (confluence) near Narsapur with the Godavari River. From here the river empties into the sea at Antarvedi. The Moola Virat (lingam), can be seen from the windows of the Garbha Gudiall on all four sides. The temple complex has many shrines, including the Sun God (Kasi Vishweswara), Goddess Parvathi, Goddess Lakshmi, Nagareswara Lingam, Dundi Vigneswara, Veera Bhadra, Sapta Matruka, Kanaka Durga, Brahma, Saraswathi, Kumara Swamy, Kartikeya, Mahishasura Mardhini, Kala Bhairava, Naga sarpa, Nataraja, Dattatreya, Nageswara, Saneeswara, Radha Krishna, and Sankara. History The Prakara was designed by Sri Velupathi during the 10th century. The construction technique resembles those built during the Chalukya period. Gopuram was constructed under the direction of sri Alladu Reddy during the 14th century Temple history. During the 17th century, Kalyana mantapam (choultry) and Ashtha Bhuja Lakshmi Narayanaswamy alaya were constructed.

Mathematically, rapidity can be defined as the hyperbolic angle that differentiates two frames of reference in relative motion, each frame being associated with distance and time coordinates. For one-dimensional motion, rapidities are additive whereas velocities must be combined by Einstein's velocity-addition formula. For low speeds, rapidity and velocity are proportional, but for higher velocities, rapidity takes a larger value, the rapidity of light being infinite. Using the inverse hyperbolic function , the rapidity corresponding to velocity is where c is the velocity of light. For low speeds, is approximately . Since in relativity any velocity is constrained to the interval the ratio satisfies . The inverse hyperbolic tangent has the unit interval for its domain and the whole real line for its range, and so the interval maps onto . History right In 1908 Hermann Minkowski explained how the Lorentz transformation could be seen as simply a hyperbolic rotation of the spacetime coordinates, i.e., a rotation through an imaginary angle.Hermann Minkowski (1908) Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies via Wikisource This angle therefore represents (in one spatial dimension) a simple additive measure of the velocity between frames.Sommerfeld, Phys. Z 1909 The rapidity parameter replacing velocity was introduced in 1910 by Vladimir VariƒáakVladimir Varicak (1910) Application of Lobachevskian Geometry in the Theory of Relativity Physikalische Zeitschrift via Wikisource and by E. T. Whittaker.E. T. Whittaker (1910) A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, page 441. The parameter was named rapidity by Alfred Robb (1911)Alfred Robb (1911) Optical Geometry of Motion p.9 and this term was adopted by many subsequent authors, such as Silberstein (1914), Morley (1936) and Rindler (2001). Area of a hyperbolic sector The quadrature of the hyperbola xy = 1 by Gregoire de Saint-Vincent established the natural logarithm as the area of a hyperbolic sector, or an equivalent area against an asymptote. In spacetime theory, the connection of events by light divides the universe into Past, Future, or Elsewhere based on a Here and Now . On any line in space, a light beam may be directed left or right. Take the x-axis as the events passed by the right beam and the y-axis as the events of the left beam. Then a resting frame has time along the diagonal x = y. The rectangular hyperbola xy = 1 can be used to gauge velocities (in the first quadrant). Zero velocity corresponds to (1,1). Any point on the hyperbola has coordinates ( e^w , \\\\ e^{-w} ) where w is the rapidity, and is equal to the area of the hyperbolic sector from (1,1) to these coordinates. Many authors refer instead to the unit hyperbola x^2 - y^2 , using rapidity for parameter, as in the standard spacetime diagram. There the axes are measured by clock and meter-stick, more familiar benchmarks, and the basis of spacetime theory. So the delineation of rapidity as hyperbolic parameter of beam-space is a reference to the seventeenth century origin of our precious transcendental functions, and a supplement to spacetime diagramming. In one spatial dimension The rapidity arises in the linear representation of a Lorentz boost as a vector-matrix product : \\\\begin{pmatrix} c t' \\\\\\\\\\\\ x' \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cosh w & -\\\\sinh w \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sinh w & \\\\cosh w \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} ct \\\\\\\\\\\\ x \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathbf \\\\Lambda (w) \\\\begin{pmatrix} ct \\\\\\\\\\\\ x \\\\end{pmatrix}. The matrix is of the type \\\\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\\\\\\\\\ q & p \\\\end{pmatrix} with and satisfying , so that lies on the unit hyperbola. Such matrices form the indefinite orthogonal group O(1,1) with one-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by the anti-diagonal unit matrix, showing that the rapidity is the coordinate on this Lie algebra. This action may be depicted in a spacetime diagram. In matrix exponential notation, can be expressed as \\\\mathbf \\\\Lambda (w) = e^{\\\\mathbf Z w}, where is the negative of the anti- diagonal unit matrix : \\\\mathbf Z = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} . It is not hard to prove that :\\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda}(w_1 + w_2) = \\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda}(w_1)\\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda}(w_2). This establishes the useful additive property of rapidity: if , and are frames of reference, then : w_{\\\\text{AC}}= w_{\\\\text{AB}} + w_{\\\\text{BC}} where denotes the rapidity of a frame of reference relative to a frame of reference . The simplicity of this formula contrasts with the complexity of the corresponding velocity-addition formula. As we can see from the Lorentz transformation above, the Lorentz factor identifies with :\\\\gamma = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}} \\\\equiv \\\\cosh w, so the rapidity is implicitly used as a hyperbolic angle in the Lorentz transformation expressions using and Œ≤. We relate rapidities to the velocity- addition formula :u=(u_1+u_2)/(1+u_1u_2/c^2) by recognizing :\\\\beta_i = \\\\frac{u_i}{c} = \\\\tanh{w_i} and so : \\\\begin{align} \\\\tanh w &= \\\\frac{\\\\tanh w_1 +\\\\tanh w_2}{1+\\\\tanh w_1\\\\tanh w_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\tanh(w_1+ w_2) \\\\end{align} Proper acceleration (the acceleration 'felt' by the object being accelerated) is the rate of change of rapidity with respect to proper time (time as measured by the object undergoing acceleration itself). Therefore, the rapidity of an object in a given frame can be viewed simply as the velocity of that object as would be calculated non-relativistically by an inertial guidance system on board the object itself if it accelerated from rest in that frame to its given speed. The product of and appears frequently, and is from the above arguments :\\\\beta \\\\gamma = \\\\sinh w \\\\,. Exponential and logarithmic relations From the above expressions we have :e^{w} = \\\\gamma(1+\\\\beta) = \\\\gamma \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{v}{c} \\\\right) = \\\\sqrt \\\\frac{1 + \\\\tfrac{v}{c}}{1 - \\\\tfrac{v}{c}}, and thus :e^{-w} = \\\\gamma(1-\\\\beta) = \\\\gamma \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{v}{c} \\\\right) = \\\\sqrt \\\\frac{1 - \\\\tfrac{v}{c}}{1 + \\\\tfrac{v}{c}}. or explicitly :w = \\\\ln \\\\left[\\\\gamma(1+\\\\beta)\\\\right] = -\\\\ln \\\\left[\\\\gamma(1-\\\\beta)\\\\right] \\\\, . The Doppler-shift factor associated with rapidity is k = e^w. In more than one spatial dimension The relativistic velocity \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta is associated to the rapidity \\\\mathbf{w} of an object via :\\\\mathfrak{so}(3,1) \\\\supset \\\\mathrm{span}\\\\\\\\{K_1, K_2, K_3\\\\\\\\} \\\\approx \\\\mathbb{R}^3 i \\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{\\\\beta}} \\\\tanh^{-1}\\\\beta, \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{B}^3, where the vector \\\\mathbf w is thought of as Cartesian coordinates on the 3-dimensional subspace of the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{o}(3, 1) \\\\approx \\\\mathfrak{so}(3, 1) of the Lorentz group spanned by the boost generators K_1, K_2, K_3 - in complete analogy with the one-dimensional case \\\\mathfrak{o}(1, 1) discussed above - and velocity space is represented by the open ball \\\\mathbb B^3 with radius 1 since |\\\\beta< 1. The latter follows from that c is a limiting velocity in relativity (with units in which c = 1). The general formula for composition of rapidities isThis is to be understood in the sense that given two velocities, the resulting rapidity is the rapidity corresponding to the two velocities relativistically added. Rapidities also have the ordinary addition inherited from \\\\mathbb R^3, and context decides which operation to use. :\\\\mathbf w = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat \\\\beta}\\\\tanh^{-1}\\\\beta, \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta = \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta_1 \\\\oplus \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta_2, where \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta_1 \\\\oplus \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta_2 refers to relativistic velocity addition and \\\\boldsymbol \\\\hat \\\\beta is a unit vector in the direction of \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta. This operation is not commutative nor associative. Rapidities \\\\mathbf w_1, \\\\mathbf w_2 with directions inclined at an angle \\\\theta have a resultant norm w \\\\equiv |\\\\mathbf w(ordinary Euclidean length) given by the hyperbolic law of cosines,Robb 1910, Variƒáak 1910, Borel 1913 :\\\\cosh w=\\\\cosh w_1\\\\cosh w_2 +\\\\sinh w_1\\\\sinh w_2 \\\\cos \\\\theta. The geometry on rapidity space is inherited from the hyperbolic geometry on velocity space via the map stated. This geometry, in turn, can be inferred from the addition law of relativistic velocities. Rapidity in two dimensions can thus be usefully visualized using the Poincar√© disk. Geodesics correspond to steady accelerations. Rapidity space in three dimensions can in the same way be put in isometry with the hyperboloid model (isometric to the -dimensional Poincar√© disk (or ball)). This is detailed in geometry of Minkowski space. The addition of two rapidities results not only in a new rapidity; the resultant total transformation is the composition of the transformation corresponding to the rapidity given above and a rotation parametrized by the vector \\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta, :\\\\Lambda = e^{-i\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf J}e^{-i\\\\mathbf w \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf K}, where the physicist convention for the exponential mapping is employed. This is a consequence of the commutation rule :[K_i,K_j] = -i\\\\epsilon_{ijk}J_k, where J_k, k = 1, 2, 3, are the generators of rotation. This is related to the phenomenon of Thomas precession. For the computation of the parameter \\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta, the linked article is referred to. In experimental particle physics The energy and scalar momentum of a particle of non-zero (rest) mass are given by: :E = \\\\gamma mc^2 :\\\\mathbf p = \\\\gamma mv. With the definition of : w = \\\\operatorname{artanh} \\\\frac{v}{c}, and thus with :\\\\cosh w = \\\\cosh \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{artanh} \\\\frac{v}{c} \\\\right) = \\\\frac {1}{ \\\\sqrt { 1- \\\\frac{v^2}{c^2} }} = \\\\gamma :\\\\sinh w = \\\\sinh \\\\left( \\\\operatorname{artanh} \\\\frac{v}{c} \\\\right) = \\\\frac {\\\\frac{v}{c}}{ \\\\sqrt { 1- \\\\frac{v^2}{c^2} }} = \\\\beta \\\\gamma , the energy and scalar momentum can be written as: :E = m c^2 \\\\cosh w :\\\\mathbf p = m c \\\\, \\\\sinh w. So, rapidity can be calculated from measured energy and momentum by : w = \\\\operatorname{artanh} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf p c}{E}= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln \\\\frac{E + \\\\mathbf p c}{E - \\\\mathbf p c}= \\\\ln \\\\frac{E + \\\\mathbf p c}{ mc^2} ~. However, experimental particle physicists often use a modified definition of rapidity relative to a beam axis :y = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln \\\\frac{E + p_z c}{E - p_z c} , where is the component of momentum along the beam axis.Amsler, C. et al., \\"The Review of Particle Physics\\", Physics Letters B 667 (2008) 1, Section 38.5.2 This is the rapidity of the boost along the beam axis which takes an observer from the lab frame to a frame in which the particle moves only perpendicular to the beam. Related to this is the concept of pseudorapidity. Rapidity relative to a beam axis can also be expressed as :y = \\\\ln \\\\frac{E + p_z c}{\\\\sqrt{m^2c^4+p_T^2 c^2} } ~.

The label was founded in 1995 by Virgil Dickerson, and is known for focusing on vinyl releases and bands in the pop-punk and alt- country genres. Its roster has included Two Cow Garage, Drag the River, Oblivion, The Gamits, and Apocalypse Hoboken. In 2006 the label founded the Vinyl Collective, an online store that serves as a community hub for independent vinyl collectors. History Suburban Home was founded and continues to be operated by Virgil Dickerson. Dickerson, who was attending college in Boulder, Colorado at University of Colorado Boulder, had started the first pop punkfanzine for the local scene in September 1995. He named the fanzine Suburban Home after the song \\"Suburban Home\\" by The Descendents. He then booked shows at the campus-run Club 156 from 1995 to 1997, and began booking shows across Colorado as well. Some of Dickerson's friends started bands and needed a label to release their first records, so he created a record label under the name Suburban Home in 1996. The label began releasing local pop-punk albums on seven-inch vinyl and home-burned CDs. The first release was the Orange County band Overlap in the summer of 1996. The second release was by The Fairlanes. Early on the label also put out the compilation album Punk: It's All About the Orchis Factor, which included early releases by bands such as Blink-182, Oblivion, and FOUR! The label initially operated distribution by mail order only, advertising in various music magazines. In 1997 Dickerson moved to work as manager at Hopeless Records in Los Angeles, who had just signed Against All Authority. After about a year he moved back to Denver, Colorado to run Suburban Home full-time. In 1998 the label opened a music retail store in Denver called Bakamono, which sold music, clothing, books, and fanzines. The store did well for a time, then closed a year later. The label started selling online in 1999. After the release of It's Crazy by Drag the River in 2000, the label began branching out from pop-punk and releasing alt-country and Americana albums as well. Suburban Home is currently an established distributor and show promoter, and in 2011 the label helped support the creation of the Colorado label Greater Than. The Vinyl Collective Suburban Home Records focused on vinyl releases from its inception, only to abandon vinyl in the late 1990s and early 2000s when the format went out of style. In 2006 the label again began releasing vinyl, starting with bands like Every Time I Die and Fear Before the March of Flames. The releases did well and the label started the online vinyl community Vinyl Collective, which quickly grew in popularity. The Vinyl Collective serves as both a blog and a vinyl-only online record store. The Vinyl Collective has released vinyl by bands such as Minus the Bear, Every Time I Die, and Portugal the Man. In January 2011 the Vinyl Collective was acquired by Fork Radio Inc., Mightier Than Swords Records and Academy Fight Song. It was relaunched in February 2011 as a community for independent vinyl collectors.

The line runs between in the west and in the east. Shippea Hill is a request stop from London Liverpool Street via Cambridge, in one of the few areas within Burnt Fen which rise just above sea level. The station is on the A1101 road between Littleport and Mildenhall. It has been noted for its low patronage: for example, only 12 passenger entries/exits were recorded at the station in 2015/16.  History  The station was opened in 1845 as Mildenhall Road. In 1885 its name was changed to Burnt Fen, and in about 1904 it adopted its current name, Shippea Hill. On 7 April 1906, a passenger train was derailed due to excessive speed. Eight passengers were injured, two seriously. Ordnance Survey maps from the 1920s show a network of narrow-gauge horse-drawn feeder agricultural tramways running south west from the station yard onto the Hiam Estate. There was also a standard gauge private railway branch running east to a chicory factory, which in turn had a network of narrow gauge agricultural tramways running south east onto the Chivers Estate. On 3 December 1976, at about 4 pm, a passenger train collided with a lorry on an unmanned level crossing at Shippea Hill. The train driver, Robert (Bob) Hitcham, was killed and eight of his passengers were injured. The wooden level crossing gates at Shippea Hill used to be operated manually by the signalman in the local signal box. In 2012, the signal box was closed and the crossing was renewed with automatic barriers and warning lights. Quietest UK railway station Shippea Hill has been recorded as one of the least-used railway stations in Britain. According to Office of Rail and Road estimates, it was the least-used railway station in 2014/15 (with 22 passengers) and 2015/16 (12 passengers). In 2016/17 there was an increase to 156 passengers. This trend has continued in subsequent years, to a recent record of 432 passengers in 2018/19. Due to its unusual status, it sometimes attracts attempts to boost its numbers. In December 2016, a finalist from The Great British Bake Off attracted at least 16 people to the station by handing out free mince pies., and in 2017 there was an increase from All the Stations, a project to visit all National Rail stations in Great Britain. In June 2019, the Odd Socks, a society at the University of Cambridge, hosted a Garden Party at the station. 71 members of the Society and their guests, all students at the university, gathered on platform 2 for dancing and drinks before returning by train to Cambridge. Simon Usborne of The Guardian wrote, \\"It's hard to imagine a more desolate place to get off a train. Shipping containers for sale stand in a muddy yard behind the far platform, opposite the pitched-roof signal box, now shuttered. Otherwise the view is of field after field, some showing maize stumps, others now peat-black and ploughed.\\"  Services  Shippea Hill is a request stop, so passengers must signal to the conductor or driver if they wish to alight or board. the station is served by one train per day (in the morning peak) to , except on Sundays.

It is generally known as the Coronation Concerto. The concerto is scored for solo piano, one flute, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpano (in D, A), and strings. Origin of the nickname \\"Coronation\\"  The traditional name associated with this work is not Mozart's own, nor was the work written on the occasion for which posterity has named it. Mozart remarked in a letter to his wife in April 1789 that he had just performed this concerto at court. But the nickname \\"Coronation\\" was derived from his playing of the work at the time of the coronation of Leopold II as Holy Roman Emperor in October 1790 in Frankfurt am Main. At the same concert, Mozart also played the Piano Concerto No. 19, K. 459. Alan Tyson in his introduction to Dover Publications' facsimile of the autograph score (which today is in the Morgan Library & Museum in New York) comments that \\"Although K. 459 has at times been called a 'Coronation' concerto, this title has nearly always been applied to K. 537\\".Alan Tyson, \\"Introduction,\\" in Mozart: Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major (\\"Coronation\\"), K. 537‚ÄîThe Autograph Score. (NY: Pierpont Morgan Library in association with Dover Publications, 1991), pp. vii.  Movements  The concerto has the following three movements: The second and third movements have their tempos given above in parentheses because in the autograph these are not given in Mozart's own handwriting but were written in by someone else. (The Neue Mozart-Ausgabe [NMA V/15/8, ed. Wolfgang Rehm] places the note \\"Tempobezeichnung im Autograph von fremder Hand\\" [\\"Tempo indication in autograph by another hand\\"] on both movements,See Neue Mozart-Ausgabe, Serie V, Werkgruppe 15, Band 8, ed. Wolfgang Rehm (Baerenreiter-Verlag, Kassel, 1960), pp. 47, 56. though the old Breitkopf & H√§rtel Complete Works edition does not have any indication that the tempos are not Mozart's own.See Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano Concertos Nos. 23‚Äì27 in Full Score (NY: Dover Publications, 1978), .)  The unfinished keyboard part  This illustration shows the beginning of the piano solo in the first movement of K. 537 (measures 81‚Äì4). The upper staff shows the notes written in Mozart's autograph score. The lower staff, presented here in smaller notes, is not given in the autograph but first appeared in the 1794 edition printed by Johann Andr√©.This is based on the Alte Mozart-Ausgabe score (Dover reprint as cited above), with consultation of the facsimile of \\"The Autograph Score\\" published by Pierpont Morgan Library/Dover Publications (cited above). The facsimile was used to eliminate slurs added by the AMA editors which are not Mozart's, and to identify the notes (left hand) added by Andr√© to Mozart's score. Measures 81‚Äì82 in the autograph manuscript, with no left-hand part. There is a very unusual feature to this concerto. In addition to omitting the tempi for two of the movements, Mozart also, in Tyson's words, \\"did not write any notes for the piano's left hand in a great many measures throughout the work.\\"Tyson, p. viii. As can be seen in the Dover Publications facsimile, large stretches of the solo part simply have nothing at all for the left hand, including the opening solo (mvmt. I, mm. 81‚Äì99) and the whole of the second movement.See Mozart: Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major (\\"Coronation\\"), K. 537‚ÄîThe Autograph Score. (NY: Pierpont Morgan Library in association with Dover Publications, 1991), pp. 8‚Äì11; 57‚Äì68. There is in fact no other Mozart piano concerto of which so much of the solo part was left unfinished by the composer. The 1794 first edition had these gaps filled in, and most Mozart scholars such as Alfred Einstein and Alan Tyson have assumed that the additions were made by the publisher Johann Andr√©. Einstein is on record as finding Andr√©'s completion somewhat wanting: \\"For the most part, this version is extremely simple and not too offensive, but at times‚Äîfor example, in the accompaniment of the Larghetto theme‚Äîit is very clumsy, and the whole solo part would gain infinitely by revision and refinement in Mozart's own style.\\"Alfred Einstein, Mozart: His Character, His Work. Trans. Arthur Mendel and Nathan Broder. (London: Oxford University Press, 1945), p. 314. Nearly all of the passages that necessitated filling in for the first edition lack only simple accompanimental patterns such as Alberti bass figures and chords. For example, measures 145‚Äì151 of the first movement, which involve more complicated virtuoso passagework, are fully written out in the autograph. For the less complex portions of the solo, it is clear that Mozart \\"knew perfectly well what he had to play\\"Einstein, p. 313. and so left them incomplete. The old Breitkopf & H√§rtel Mozart Complete Works score of this concerto does not make any distinction between what Mozart himself wrote and what Andr√© (or someone commissioned by him) supplied. However, the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe volume referenced above prints Andr√©'s supplements in smaller type, to clearly distinguish them from Mozart's own notes.  Critical reception  While this concerto has enjoyed popularity due to its beauty and rococo (or galant) style, it is not generally regarded today to be of the level of quality of the twelve previous Viennese piano concertos or the final concerto in B.Hutchings, A. 1997. A Companion to Mozart's Piano Concertos, Oxford University Press. Girdlestone, C. M. 1997. Mozart's piano concertos. Cassell, London. This amounts to a complete reversal of critical opinion, since K. 537 was once one of Mozart's most celebrated keyboard concertos, especially during the 19th century. In 1935, Friedrich Blume, editor of the Eulenburg edition of this work, called it \\"the best known and most frequently played\\" of Mozart's piano concertos.As quoted in Tyson, p. xi. But writing in 1945, Einstein commented: Nonetheless, the \\"Coronation\\" concerto remains frequently performed today.

Confidence tricks and pyramid schemes in the 20th and 21st century such as Nouveau Riche (real estate investment college) have embraced the term, leading contemporary usage of the term to be synonymous with unscrupulous practices. Bird-dogging \\"Bird dogs\\" get paid a referral fee for finding good deals for other investors. This is often where people begin their investing career as there is only time at stake. They are typically paid when the deal closes. Some birddogs will structure companies and partnership arrangements as they're frequently not real estate agents and may not be able to collect a \\"referral fee\\" for their services. These partnership are often structured utilizing a joint venture (JV) agreement. Options An option is defined as the right to buy a property for a specified price (strike price) during a specified period of time. An owner of a property may sell an option for someone to buy it on or before a future date at a predetermined price. The buyer of the option hopes the value of the property will either go up or is already low. The seller receives a premium called \\"option consideration\\". The buyer may then either exercise the option by buying the property or sell the option to someone else to exercise (or sell). This is often done to obtain control over a property without much cash. Option premiums are typically non-refundable. The option represents an equitable interest in the property and may be recorded at the county recorders office. Short sale or preforeclosure When a property owner fails to make their mortgage payments for a number of months they are in default. The first step of the foreclosure process (which typically takes a number of months) that the lender will take is to file the notice of default. This is a public document that is recorded. The property owner will contract to sell the home conditioned upon the lender accepting a lesser amount than what is owed on the mortgage. Note that there are no similarities between a real estate short sale and selling a stock short. In many jurisdictions, including the United States, the seller is responsible for taxes on the amount of the mortgage left unpaid after the sale as ordinary income. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, enacted Dec 20, 2007, generally allows taxpayers to exclude income from the discharge of debt on their principal residence. Debt reduced through mortgage restructuring, as well as mortgage debt forgiven in connection with a foreclosure, qualifies for the relief. The original effective date was through 2009 but in October 2008, legislation extended the relief through 2012. Use IRS form 982 to handle the debt relief provision.  Hard money lenders  These are often used to finance projects that are unconventional, great deals, or where money is needed quickly. Typically hard money lenders will lend 50-70% of the value of the property regardless of the sales price (unlike banks). They will typically close loans in 2‚Äì7 days. Credit scores and income are often overlooked by hard money lenders, however they may ask to see a business plan or exit strategy for the project. They may get paid via points (e.g. 1 point equals one percent of the total amount borrowed), interest rate (10-20% per year is common), and an equitable interest. These will vary based on the size of the project and the agreed upon contract. Hard money lenders are collateral based and typically require first position on the property.  Tax liens  This may not clearly fall in the category of \\"real estate investing\\", however it is worth mentioning. Each state creates the system and rules for the lien or deed process so careful research is necessary. In general, property owners are notified regarding the amount of taxes owed and are given a period of time to pay. If the amount remains delinquent, the state will take one of the following paths (though some have created a hybrid):  Tax lien state  The county in which the property is located sells the lien certificate at a sale or auction. Some states sell the lien for the delinquent amount while others allow bidding to begin at that price. The purchaser of the tax lien collects interest (predetermined by the state) from the home owner on the amount that was paid for the tax lien. If the tax lien (with interest) goes unpaid during the redemption period, the investor may foreclose on the home. Unlike most foreclosures, when a tax lien is foreclosed on, all other liens and mortgages are abolished and the property would be owned \\"free and clear\\". Typically the lender will pay off the tax lien to avoid losing their house and/or property.  Tax deed state  The county government sells the deed to the property at a public sale or auction. The benefit for investors is the ability to purchase property at discounted rates, often for the amount owed in taxes. When an account becomes delinquent, the property is listed at the tax assessor's office, some are even online. Properties with homes are usually purchased by investors (often referred to as sharks) prior to foreclosure.  Paper/notes/mortgage investing  This also is less of a \\"creative real estate investing\\" technique as typically described. Mortgages are often sold by lenders to other lending institutions. Investors can broker transactions by arranging buyers and sellers of notes to meet or by buying them and immediately selling them for a profit.  Flipping  Flipping is buying an under priced property and then quickly reselling it at market value. Homes are typically sold below value by uninformed sellers or those in distress (like job loss or foreclosure). Often a property is sold under market value because it is a \\"fixer upper\\". Sometimes they require very little such as paint and carpet and other times they have mold, asbestos, or foundation issues. These inherently hold more risk and more work, and therefore often have substantial profits.  Land trust  Land Trusts have traditionally been used as a non-profit entity to own property. In recent years, many companies have developed methodologies that allow for Land Trusts to be used to acquire properties in foreclosure allowing homeowners to save their homes and making it possible for investors to see incredible returns. In a Real Estate Investment model Land Trusts bring ease to the transaction. While some people believe that using a Land Trust also brings a benefit of not causing Due-on- sale clauses to force the refinancing of the subject property, this is only true when the borrower is and remains a beneficiary of the trust and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property. While the use of Land Trusts by real estate investors does make it more difficult for a lender to discover a transfer has occurred, the loan can still be accelerated if it is discovered since a transfer has occurred. By federal law a transfer to a trustee in an inter vivos trust (to which classification a residential property land trust belongs) cannot be considered a due-on-sale (due-on-transfer) violation unless all of one's beneficiary interest would have been transferred to another. Title 12 of the US Code Para. 1701-j-3 - i.e., the Garn‚ÄìSt. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, specifically makes this point. What this means is that a partial beneficiary interest, of one to ninety-nine percent, can be given (assigned) to a co-beneficiary without triggering a lender's alienation recourse (i.e., the due-on-sale penalty requiring immediate satisfaction in-full of the mortgage loan. In so much as the land trust is beneficiary-directed rather than being directed and managed by its trustee, a remainder agent (i.e., a party appointed to assume responsibility for the trust and its corpus in the event of the death or incapacity of the original director-manager beneficiary) can be a remainder beneficiary (co-beneficiary), rather than needing to be remainder trustee, as would be the case with the standard, and far more common, trustee-directed inter vivos trust (i.e., the fully funded inter vivos family trust).

Cedar Creek Mine Ride is one of two roller coasters at Cedar Point to utilize two separate lift hills ‚Äì the other is Iron Dragon. History Following the success of Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland which opened in 1959, the tubular steel track design pioneered by Arrow Dynamics was in high demand at other amusement parks around the world. Arrow developed a runaway mine train concept that would be used in many of its first roller coasters. Among them was the Cedar Creek Mine Ride at Cedar Point, which opened in 1969 as the centerpiece for the new Frontiertown section of the park. It is the second-oldest roller coaster at Cedar Point and has given over 62 million rides since its debut. Ride experience Cedar Creek Mine Ride is a multi-lift hill roller coaster that features short dips and turns throughout a lightly wooded area and over a lagoon. The ride starts by entering a mine building, which functions as the track transfer and housing for additional trains, and then up the first lift hill. At the top of the hill riders experience a very short drop followed by several turns taking place high off the ground until a larger drop over a lagoon. After passing over the lagoon, riders enter into a helix and then onto the second lift-hill. After the second lift, riders again experience a short dip along with some turns raised off the ground. The end of the ride features a double helix before entering the station.

The festival, which is saluting Ghana in 2021, honors a specific foreign country every year and features many events. The Beale Street Music Festival takes place the first weekend in May and showcases an eclectic lineup of national and local musical talent. International Week is a series of exhibits, screenings, arts and performances dedicated to each year's honored country. The World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest has become one of the most popular barbecue contests in the country and has been here for years. The Great American River Run Half Marathon & 5K welcomes runners of all experience levels through the streets of Memphis and along the banks of the Mississippi River, while 901Fest is a unique celebration that includes a salute to all things Memphis.  Beale Street Music Festival (BSMF)   About  The Beale Street Music Festival is a three-day music festival that has both a mix of big-name stars and local musical acts. Held during the first weekend of May in the city's Tom Lee Park at the foot of Beale Street, it is considered to be the kick-off event of the entire Memphis in May International Festival celebration. It typically hosts over 100,000 people during the weekend. The Beale Street Music Festival is the only program that has been held every year since the inception of Memphis in May in 1977. Its history can be traced back to the 1800s, when African-American musicians throughout the South would come to Beale Street and perform.  Past Performers  The Beale Street Music Festival is known for featuring an eclectic mix of genres on its lineup every year, from blues and rock 'n roll to rap and pop. The list of bands and musicians that have performed at the festival continue to grow each year, but the list includes Stevie Ray Vaughan, Ray Charles, B.B. King in '91 (d.2015, lived in Memphis), John Lee Hooker in '91, Booker T. and the M.G.'s in '99, Jerry Lee Lewis from Memphis in '03, Box Tops from Memphis in '97, Big Star in '99, Fuel from the Jackson, TN area in '04, Saliva from Memphis in '04, Willie Nelson, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Al Green in '09 (now a preacher in Memphis), Isaac Hayes from Memphis in '00 (d.2008), John Prine, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Black Crowes, Van Morrison, Dave Matthews Band, Widespread Panic, Foo Fighters, The Killers, Snoop Dogg, Kid Rock, John Mayer, Journey, Nelly, Steely Dan, Allman Brothers, Santana, James Taylor, Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, Korn, The Avett Brothers, Mumford & Sons, Kings of Leon from Nashville in '17, Paramore from Nashville in '15, 10 Years from Knoxville in '06, Soundgarden, Wiz Khalifa, Jane's Addiction, Chuck Berry, The Black Keys, Avenged Sevenfold, Alabama Shakes, Lenny Kravitz, Ed Sheeran, Neil Young, Beck, Paul Simon, Ziggy Marley, Sturgill Simpson, Aretha Franklin in '09 (d.2018, born in Memphis), Earth, Wind & Fire in '10 (Maurice White was born in Memphis and d.2016), Yo Gotti in '16, Three 6 Mafia (from Memphis) in '06, Weezer, and many more. 2018 Beale Street Music Festival dates: May 4 - 6, 2018.  International Week  Every year the festival recognizes a different country, most recently saluting the Czech Republic in 2018. A week of events that typically begin the day after the Beale Street Music Fest, International Week is dedicated to a country and showcases the foods and culture of that nation. While International Week provides a learning experience for the community at large, the core is a comprehensive educational program for area youth in public and private schools throughout Memphis and Shelby County. The goal of International Week is for area students, by the time they graduate from high school, to have had the opportunity to experience the customs and cultures of 12 countries. The festival's first two honored countries ‚Äî Japan and Canada ‚Äì have been featured twice. Perhaps most important are the trade delegates that visit Memphis and have introductions to suitable, high-level trade partners.  Honored Countries  Through the years, the Memphis in May International Festival has played host to ambassadors, exhibits and performance troupes from 38 countries. The milestone twentieth annual event in 1996 honored all previous selected countries. The 2019 event honored the bicentennials of the founding of the city of Memphis and of the establishment of Shelby County. The West African nation of Ghana, originally selected for honor in 2020, is slated for focus during festivities in 2021. 1977: Japan 1978: Canada 1979: Germany 1980: Venezuela 1981: Egypt 1982: Netherlands 1983: Israel 1984: Mexico 1985: Australia 1986: Japan 1987: China 1988: United Kingdom 1989: Kenya 1990: France 1991: New Zealand 1992: Italy 1993: Russia 1994: C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire 1995: Thailand 1996: All previous countries 1997: Brazil 1998: Portugal 1999: Morocco 2000: India 2001: Netherlands 2002: Argentina 2003: South Korea 2004: South Africa 2005: Ireland 2006: Costa Rica 2007: Spain 2008: Turkey 2009: Chile 2010: Tunisia 2011: Belgium 2012: Philippines 2013: Sweden 2014: Panama 2015: Poland 2016: Canada 2017: Colombia 2018: Czech Republic 2019: City of Memphis & Shelby County 2020: Festivities cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic 2021: Ghana World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest (WCBCC) History The WCBCC started in 1978 with 26 teams. The contest drew 50 teams in 1979, 80 in 1980, and 180 teams from nine states in 1981. It has now grown to be the largest pork barbecue competition in the world. More than 250 teams from 20+ states and several countries compete, and an estimated 100,000 people attend the competition. Media from around the world, including BBC and The Food Network, come to the city to cover the event. Credit for the original idea of a barbecue contest goes to Rodney Baber, chairman of the Memphis in May events committee in 1977, and his co-worker Jack Powell, Tennessee's reigning chili champ at the time. The original champion at the first competition was Bessie Louise Cathey, who won a $500 prize, a sizable return for her $12 entry fee. Today, the prizes for each event range from $300 to $15,000 for the main cooking competition, and from $250 to $2,500 for the ancillary contests. Today's entry fees range from $700 to $2,600 just for renting the necessary booth space, and an extra $60 per competition entry. Some teams regularly budget amounts in excess of $15,000 just for the competition and booth. In 1989, when MIM officials discovered that there was a feast in Honolulu which earned the title of \\"largest barbecue\\" in the Guinness Book of Records, they calculated the amount of food prepared at the WCBCC. The total was 55,297 pounds of pork, and thus earned the WCBCC a record in the 1990 edition. Over 16 tons of pork were smoked at the 2016 WCBCC. The 2017 World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest was the first time the event spanned four days instead of three. In addition, the Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q team became the first five-time champion of the event (2017, '14, '11, '03, '00). Food events Pork Shoulder Event Judging The competition has three official meat categories: rib, shoulder and whole hog. There is also the Patio Porkers division, which encourages up to 40 amateur teams (who have not previously won the Patio Porker division in the WCBCC) to enter. Only wood and charcoal cooking is allowed at the event, no gas or any other sort of heat system is allowed to be used. Beyond those main categories, teams also compete in several other ancillary contests over the four-day event, including: Best Sauce (Tomato/Mustard/Vinegar), Frank's Red Hot Hot Wings, Kingsford Tour of Champions and Anything But (Exotic/Beef/Seafood/Poultry). Special events * Ms. Piggie - Teams dress up contestants as pigs, and then perform songs or skits on stage. * Best Booth - Booths are judged on design, originality and connection with the honored country. * T-Shirt Design - Shirts are judged on design, originality and connection with the honored country. * Sauce Wrestling - Things get a little messy with this one as teams send a representative to the wrestling ring filled with over 40 gallons of barbecue sauce. * Big Hog Run - Coined as \\"America's most prestigious .2K race,\\" the Big Hog Run is a thrilling 656-foot sprint down Beale Street. Only WCBCC team members and judges are allowing to compete. * Cooker Caravan - The Cooker Caravan provides the public a behind-the-scenes look at competition barbecue by offering guided tours to teams in each championship category. 2018 WCBCC dates: May 16 - 19, 2018  Great American River Run Half-Marathon & 5K  The Great American River Run made its Memphis in May debut in 2016. The race attracts runners of all experience level, featuring half marathon and 5K distances. The race course takes runners through downtown Memphis and along the banks of the Mississippi River. The inaugural race drew over 2,000 runners from more than 30 states. Every registrant is given a race t-shirt and every finisher is awarded a medal. 2018 MIMGARR race: May 26, 2018  901Fest  901Fest made its inaugural appearance at the 2016 Memphis in May International Festival.

It is not a permanent court and it sits only when a case belonging to its special competence arises. It is regarded as the supreme \\"constitutional\\" and \\"electoral\\" court of Greece. Its decisions are irrevocable and binding for all the courts, including the Supreme Courts. However, the Supreme Special Court does not have an hierarchical relation with the three Supreme Courts (the Court of Cassation, the Council of State and the Chamber of Accounts). It is not considered higher than these courts and it does not belong to any branch (civil, penal, administrative) of the Greek justice system. Composition According to the article 100 of the Constitution the Supreme Special Court comprises eleven members. Namely: * the presidents of the three Supreme Courts, * four members of the Court of Cassation, chosen by lot for a two-years term, * four members of the Council of State, chosen by lot for a two-years term. The Court is presided over by the seniormost president of either the Court of Cassation or the Council of State. When the Supreme Special Court: a) resolves the conflicts between the administration and the courts or between the administrative and the civil courts or between the Chamber of Accounts and the other courts, or b) resolves a dispute about the constitutionality of a legal provision or about the real meaning of a legal provision, then the Court comprises two extra members: two (full) professors of Law, appointed by lot. History The history of the Supreme Special Court is quite short, as it was first founded by the Constitution of 1975. Its organisation and function is regulated by the article 100 of the Constitution of 1975/1986/2001 and the Law 345/1976. Germs of this Court exist in the article 73 of the Constitution of 1952 (providing for a special electoral court) and in the constitutions of the military junta (1967-1974), providing for a special court resolving the disputes between the Supreme Courts. Jurisdiction The jurisdiction of the Supreme Special Court is strictly defined by the Constitution (article 100). Hence: * It judges pleas against the validity of the results of the legislative elections * It controls the validity of the results of the referendums. * It decides the deposition of a member of the Parliament, according to the constitutional provisions. * It resolves the conflicts between the administration and the courts or between the administrative and the civil courts or between the Chamber of Accounts and the other courts * It resolves a dispute about the constitutionality of a legal provision or about the real meaning of a legal provision * It decides whether a rule of international law belongs to the customary international law. The Court as the \\"Supreme Electoral Court\\" Since the Supreme Special Court has the power to issue an irrevocable and binding decision, with which a member of the Parliament loses their position, it becomes the \\"supreme electoral court\\". According to the article 58 of the Constitution, the court examines pleas concerning electoral violations or lack of legal qualifications of candidates. It also controls whether a member of the Parliament has undertaken duties incompatible with their office. These incompatible duties are enumerated in article 57 of the Constitution. If the Supreme Special Court ascertains the incompatibility of the undertaken duties, the deputy loses their office \\"by operation of law\\". The Court as the \\"Supreme Constitutional Court\\" In Greece every court controls the constitutionality of the laws and there is no \\"permanent\\" Supreme Constitutional Court, as in Spain, Germany etc. If any court judges a legal provision as \\"unconstitutional\\", it decides not to apply it, but it has not the power to declare the legal provision \\"null and void\\". This restriction is also binding for the Supreme Courts, which declare the unconstitutional legal provision \\"inapplicable\\". Nonetheless, if a case concerning the constitutionality of a law is introduced into the Supreme Special Court (after the issuing of contradictory decisions of the Supreme Courts), the Court has the constitutional right to declare an unconstitutional legal provision as \\"powerless\\". This means that the unconstitutional legal provision still exists (it is not formally \\"null and void\\"), but it is expelled from the Greek \\"law and order\\". The decision of the Supreme Special Court, declaring the unconstitutionality of a legal provision is final, irrevocable, binding for every Greek court, including the Supreme Courts, and judges the matter once for ever. No court has the right to take a different decision for the same legal provision in the future. If a court of first instance or a court of appeals or even a Supreme Court had judged the same matter in a contradictory way before the issuing of the decision of the Supreme Special Court, it is obliged to reverse is judgement and to reissue it in accordance with the Supreme Special Court's decision. Another \\"Special Court\\" The Supreme Special Court of article 100 must not be confused with the \\"Special Court\\" of article 86 of the Constitution. This last \\"Special Court\\" is an ad hoc court, competent to judge alleged criminal acts of members of government (previous or in service), committed in their official capacity only (i.e. not common criminal or civil offenses committed in their personal capacity) and only when impeached by Parliament. It is also competent to judge the President of the Republic, if impeached by Parliament for intentional violation of the Constitution or for high treason. In such cases, Parliament acts as the prosecuting attorney and the defendant(s) may be represented by lawyers of their choice, as in any court. This \\"Special Court\\" comprises seven judges of the Court of Cassation and six judges of the Council of State, chosen by lot. It is presided over by the seniormost judge for the Court of Cassation.

He is widely considered to be one of the all-time great players of hardball squash (a North American variant of squash played with a faster- moving ball and on slightly smaller courts than the international \\"softball\\" squash game). He was the dominant player on the hardball squash circuit throughout the 1970s. Sharif was born in Pakistan, and is the son of the legendary squash player Hashim Khan (who dominated the international squash game in the 1950s).  Biography  Sharif is the eldest of Hashim Khan's 12 children, and a member of the Khan squash family. At the age of 11, he was awarded a squash scholarship at Millfield School in Somerset, England. Despite having almost no knowledge of the English language when he arrived, he performed well academically and also developed into an outstanding squash player who, by 1962, had won every public school title open to him including the public schools under-15 championship (three times), the public schools under-16 championship, the Evans Cup, and the Drysdale Cup (considered at the time to be the unofficial world junior championship). At the age of 13 he also captured the Somerset County Men's A title. In the two years after he left Millfield, Sharif won the West of England title, the East of England title, the Surrey Open and the Scottish Amateur title. In 1970, he reached the semi- finals of the British Open (which was considered to be the effective world championship of the sport at the time). Khan's greatest achievements came on the North American hardball squash circuit. He settled in Canada in 1968, and came to dominate the professional hardball squash circuit for well over a decade. He captured every major North American hardball title, and won the North American Open (the most prestigious hardball title at the time) a record 12 times in 13 years between 1969 and 1981 (he reached the final 15 consecutive times between 1968 and 1982). He also won the US Professional Championships nine times in ten years between 1970 and 1979.

It was notable as being the only indoor roller coaster at Cedar Point, the only bobsled roller coaster in the Midwestern United States, and the only enclosed bobsled roller coaster in the world at its debut. The name of the ride stems from a rearrangement of the letters \\"Dispatch Master Transport\\", which could still be seen in the ride's logo in its later years. Before the ride was enclosed, the supports and outer sides of the track were painted blue. History Disaster Transport was originally known as Avalanche Run and was entirely outdoors. On October 19, 1984, Cedar Point announced that Avalanche Run would be added to the park. The ride would open on May 11, 1985. It was built next to the beach, on the former spot of Jumbo Jet and later, WildCat. Many other rides also had to be relocated. The original ride cost $3.4 million: $1.9 million to manufacture and $1.5 million to install. Renovation The loading platform of Disaster Transport On October 22, 1989, Cedar Point announced that Avalanche Run would receive a major refurbishment and be renamed Disaster Transport for the 1990 season. ITEC Productions, Inc. was chosen to renovate the ride, completely enclosing it in a show building. The renovation included the addition of a space-themed queue and ride along with special effect lighting, two robot animatronics, and sound. The special effects and construction cost approximately $4 million. On the outside of the building, \\"12 E\\" was written, which had caused numerous rumors as to its meanings. On August 3, 2005, it was revealed that it stood for the 12th ride designed by the ITEC employee, Eric. Not long after the changes to the ride in 1990, the special effects began to deteriorate due to a lack of upkeep. By the time the ride closed, many of the effects were no longer active or had been covered up. Blacklight reactant paint lined the walls, mostly in the form of handprints or outlines of scenes. These gave a 3-D appearance when the rider wore special glasses purchased at the beginning of the queue. Closure Demolition of Disaster Transport After Matt Ouimet replaced Richard Kinzel as the CEO of Cedar Fair in 2012, he decided that Disaster Transport could no longer be salvaged. The ride was becoming an outdated attraction, as well as an eyesore. On July 13, 2012, Cedar Point announced that Disaster Transport would close on July 29, 2012. It was the second roller coaster at Cedar Point to close in 2012. A charity auction was held for the final riders, benefiting the Give Kids the World charity foundation. The last ride was given at 11:53 PM on July 29, with the lights turned on. The ride started demolition on August 6, using about 380 trucks to transport scrap materials. A portion of track, two cars and the main entrance sign were to be donated to the National Roller Coaster Museum. Less than a month later on August 29, the last section of Disaster Transport was demolished. The 12E part of the building was the last section left standing. Ride experience Inside the Repair Bay Disaster Transport was a bobsled roller coaster, meaning the wheels were not attached to a track as on a conventional roller coaster. The cars ‚Äî resembling bobsleds ‚Äî operated within a steel trough, on which they were allowed to operate freely. This allowed the ride to swing from side to side when turning sharp corners, as an actual bobsled would. Guests would enter 10 passenger bobsleds, secured by a lap bar. After leaving the \\"launch area\\", the bobsled traveled up the lift hill at a 15-degree-angle, which featured red and blue blinking lights on the sides. After reaching the top of the lift hill, it curved to the right, dropping at a 27-degree-angle and reaching a top speed of 40 mph (64 km/h). After that, it curved to the left into a mid course brake run. After the mid course brake run, the bobsled turned left followed by several banked turns and curves and two more brake runs. One cycle of the ride lasted about 2 minutes and 32 seconds. Theme After the ride was renovated in 1990, a new space theme was given. The story of the ride was the passengers had been to deliver cargo from a suborbital factory to a station in Alaska. Large screen projections, simulated lasers, mist, and recordings were added to the ride. In the queue, guests would go through three rooms including Rocket Recovery, Mission Control and Repair Bay. The original entrance to the ride was located next to Troika. During HalloWeekends, the park would change the entrance of Disaster Transport to under the lift hill, leaving the one next to Troika to be used for the Halloween Haunt. For the 2009 season, the entrance was permanently changed to under the lift hill. When the entrance was changed, the Rocket Recovery and Mission Control rooms were closed, leaving the Repair Bay the only room guests walked through. The Original Ride The ride experience was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under the middle of the coaster's lift. After entering, an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was \\"Mission Control\\". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company \\"The Dispatch Master\\" or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting at the desk would say to the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the \\"service rooms\\" of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed \\"Rocket Recovery\\", guests would see a \\"rocket locator\\" robot named \\"Dave\\" working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the \\"Repair Bay\\". A room showcasing a robotic foreman animatronic named \\"Franc\\" looking around the room (he was later removed). There were also suspended conveyor baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms \\"repairing\\" a rocket, and a security scanner that flashed \\"REJECT\\" after scanning guests. A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the \\"Launch Area\\" rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an \\"on-board computer\\" welcomed you and started the \\"automatic launch sequence\\". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer took notice of nearby \\"space pirates\\" and began to perform evasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouted \\"I'm losing control, I'm losing control!\\" before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells \\"WELCOME TO ALASKA!\\" The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left. Building Entrance to Happy Jack's Toy Factory The building was also used as a storage facility for the park. During HalloWeekends, much of the original queue area was used to house a haunt attraction. It was first used in 1997 for the haunt, Cedar Point Cemetery. In 2000, it was transformed into the Egyptian themed, Pharaoh's Secret haunted house. In 2009, it was transformed into Happy Jack's Toy Factory, a haunted toy factory. The ride, though indoors, would close in any type of rain. Because of leaks in the structure, water pooled in the trough, warranting a shutdown. Typically, the ride would remain shut down after a period of rain as the crew would have to cycle several trains through the circuit in order for it to dry. Although the ride was enclosed, the storage track remained outdoors with a large door that opened when the storage track was needed.

VUSN enjoys a close relationship with its university parent and with the separate nonprofit Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The School of Nursing is ranked in the top 10 in the U.S. News & World Report rankings. Its master of science in nursing program ranked at No. 8 in the 2020 rankings. Its doctor of nursing practice program ranked at No. 5.  History  With a history dating back to 1908, Vanderbilt University School of Nursing has a long-standing reputation in nursing teaching, practice, informatics and research. As one of the first five schools to receive Rockefeller funding to implement the Goldmark Report of 1923, the School of Nursing was a leader in drastically altering the nature of nursing education and moving it into institutions of higher learning. The School began offering the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) in 1955. It was one of the first to launch a PreSpecialty program in 1986 allowing students who hold non-nursing degrees to enter the MSN program without repeating undergraduate classes. This permitted an accelerated path to the master's degree. Vanderbilt's Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree, first conferred in 1935, was restructured into the PreSpecialty program as one of several innovative entry options. In 1993, Vanderbilt School of Nursing established the PhD in Nursing Science program, leading to nursing research and scholarly activity that has positively impacted health care delivery in a variety of areas. The Doctor of Nursing Practice Program began in August 2008. The inaugural class of 31 students graduated in 2010.  Education  The school became exclusively a graduate school in 1989 with a mission of educating advanced level nurses. It has established Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) programs in numerous advanced practice nursing specialty areas. The school has multiple entry options for nurses and non-nurses, admitting students from educational backgrounds other than nursing and allowing them to complete a course of work leading to an advanced practice nursing degree. The school also offers a PhD in Nursing Science‚Äîclinical research or health services research‚Äîand a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). VUSN offers the following MSN specialty programs: * Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner * Adult- Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner * Emergency Nurse Practitioner * Family Nurse Practitioner * Neonatal Nurse Practitioner * Nurse-Midwifery * Nurse-Midwifery/FNP Dual Focus *Nursing and Health Care Leadership * Nursing Informatics * Pediatric Nurse Practitioner - Acute Care * Pediatric Nurse Practitioner - Primary Care * Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (Lifespan) * Women's Health Nurse Practitioner * Women's Health Nurse Practitioner /Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Dual Focus Vanderbilt University School of Nursing also offers these advanced degree programs: * Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) * Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Nursing Research *Post-Master's Certificates *Postdoctoral Program  Teaching Affiliates  *Vanderbilt University Hospital *Monroe Carell, Jr., Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt *Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center *The Vanderbilt Clinic *Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center *Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Hospital *Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital *Vanderbilt Sports Medicine *Dayani Human Performance Center *Vanderbilt Heart & Vascular Institute References External links *Vanderbilt University School of Nursing *Vanderbilt Nurse Category:Vanderbilt University Category:Nursing schools in Tennessee ","title":"Vanderbilt University School of Nursing"},{"id":"4521004","text":"Iron Dragon is a steel suspended roller coaster located at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. Built in 1987 by Arrow Dynamics, it is located in the Celebration Plaza section of the park. History Before Iron Dragon's 1987 debut, the Western Cruise (later known as Paddlewheel Excursions) boats circumnavigated the waters around this island. The popular boat ride's station sat on the same part of the midway where Iron Dragon‚Äôs station rests today. (Riders can still spot the docking cleats welded to the dock while climbing the stairs to the boarding station.) The Monster circular ride used to call the land under Iron Dragon's transfer track home. Monster closed on Labor Day weekend in 1986 so Iron Dragon construction could begin. Planning for Iron Dragon began in 1985, the same year the Frontier Lift cable car ride (similar to the Sky Ride found on Cedar Point‚Äôs main midway) opened for its final season. In the early and mid-1990s, a \\"remote a boat\\" game was housed in the water under Iron Dragon's final helix element. This was removed in 1997. Characteristics Iron Dragon's previous color scheme was red track with gray supports, similar paint schemes to that of Ninja at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Vortex at Canada's Wonderland (both are also Arrow suspended swinging coasters). In 2004, the supports were repainted yellow orange, giving Iron Dragon a similar paint scheme to Top Thrill Dragster. Unlike most Arrow suspended coasters, the lead car on each of Iron Dragon's train has a silver grab handle for riders to hold onto mounted on the front of the car. Virtual reality In July 2016, Cedar Point began testing the use of virtual reality on Iron Dragon, in which riders wear Samsung Gear VR headsets to experience the 3D digital effects. Availibility was limited from 6 ‚Äì 9 p.m, and guests were required to sign up earlier in the day. Following positive feedback, Cedar Point made the new feature permanent on June 9, 2017, but later removed it on September 8, 2018. Ride experience This type of roller coaster features cars that hang beneath the track by a chassis allowing them to swing side to side. Some parts of the ride are built on artificial lagoons, and the track takes riders into wooded areas and over water. Iron Dragon is one of two roller coasters at Cedar Point to utilize two separate lift hills, the other being Cedar Creek Mine Ride. Both hills are built side by side and head in opposite directions. After departing the station, the ride turns to the right. After ascending the first lift, which travels partially underneath Rougarou's lift hill and first drop, the ride descends down the ride's first drop and then rises into a wide left turn. This leads into a right turn, followed by a slight turn to the left and another turn to the right. The ride descends as it continues right and climbs upward, entering a descending, 270-degree helix. The train then enters a brake run and second lift hill, which moves in the opposite direction as the first. The drop is not very steep, but twists side to side, first going left, then right, then left again. The ride then pulls up, transitioning from a left to a right turn. The next drop curves left slightly, followed by a right-hand turn and drop into a right-hand helix. Water nozzles that spray mist are positioned under the pretzel-shaped helix, although these do not always run. After exiting the helix, the ride dips and rises once more, turns left and then right, followed by the final brake run leading back into the station.

These models can be seen as generalizations of linear models (in particular, linear regression), although they can also extend to non-linear models. These models became much more popular after sufficient computing power and software became available. Multilevel models are particularly appropriate for research designs where data for participants are organized at more than one level (i.e., nested data). The units of analysis are usually individuals (at a lower level) who are nested within contextual/aggregate units (at a higher level). While the lowest level of data in multilevel models is usually an individual, repeated measurements of individuals may also be examined. As such, multilevel models provide an alternative type of analysis for univariate or multivariate analysis of repeated measures. Individual differences in growth curves may be examined. Furthermore, multilevel models can be used as an alternative to ANCOVA, where scores on the dependent variable are adjusted for covariates (e.g. individual differences) before testing treatment differences. Multilevel models are able to analyze these experiments without the assumptions of homogeneity-of-regression slopes that is required by ANCOVA. Multilevel models can be used on data with many levels, although 2-level models are the most common and the rest of this article deals only with these. The dependent variable must be examined at the lowest level of analysis. Level 1 regression equation When there is a single level 1 independent variable, the level 1 model is: Y_{ij} = \\\\beta_{0j} + \\\\beta_{1j} X_{ij} + e_{ij} *Y_{ij} refers to the score on the dependent variable for an individual observation at Level 1 (subscript i refers to individual case, subscript j refers to the group). *X_{ij} refers to the Level 1 predictor. *\\\\beta_{0j} refers to the intercept of the dependent variable in group j (Level 2). * \\\\beta_{1j} refers to the slope for the relationship in group j (Level 2) between the Level 1 predictor and the dependent variable. * e_{ij} refers to the random errors of prediction for the Level 1 equation (it is also sometimes referred to as r_{ij}). At Level 1, both the intercepts and slopes in the groups can be either fixed (meaning that all groups have the same values, although in the real world this would be a rare occurrence), non- randomly varying (meaning that the intercepts and/or slopes are predictable from an independent variable at Level 2), or randomly varying (meaning that the intercepts and/or slopes are different in the different groups, and that each have their own overall mean and variance). When there are multiple level 1 independent variables, the model can be expanded by substituting vectors and matrices in the equation. Level 2 regression equation The dependent variables are the intercepts and the slopes for the independent variables at Level 1 in the groups of Level 2. \\\\beta_{0j} = \\\\gamma_{00} + \\\\gamma_{01} W_j + u_{0j} \\\\beta_{1j} = \\\\gamma_{10} + u_{1j} *\\\\gamma_{00} refers to the overall intercept. This is the grand mean of the scores on the dependent variable across all the groups when all the predictors are equal to 0. *W_j refers to the Level 2 predictor. *\\\\gamma_{01} refers to the overall regression coefficient, or the slope, between the dependent variable and the Level 2 predictor. *u_{0j} refers to the random error component for the deviation of the intercept of a group from the overall intercept. *\\\\gamma_{10} refers to the overall regression coefficient, or the slope, between the dependent variable and the Level 1 predictor. *u_{1j} refers to the error component for the slope (meaning the deviation of the group slopes from the overall slope). Types of models Before conducting a multilevel model analysis, a researcher must decide on several aspects, including which predictors are to be included in the analysis, if any. Second, the researcher must decide whether parameter values (i.e., the elements that will be estimated) will be fixed or random. Fixed parameters are composed of a constant over all the groups, whereas a random parameter has a different value for each of the groups. Additionally, the researcher must decide whether to employ a maximum likelihood estimation or a restricted maximum likelihood estimation type. Random intercepts model A random intercepts model is a model in which intercepts are allowed to vary, and therefore, the scores on the dependent variable for each individual observation are predicted by the intercept that varies across groups. This model assumes that slopes are fixed (the same across different contexts). In addition, this model provides information about intraclass correlations, which are helpful in determining whether multilevel models are required in the first place. Random slopes model A random slopes model is a model in which slopes are allowed to vary, and therefore, the slopes are different across groups. This model assumes that intercepts are fixed (the same across different contexts). Random intercepts and slopes model A model that includes both random intercepts and random slopes is likely the most realistic type of model, although it is also the most complex. In this model, both intercepts and slopes are allowed to vary across groups, meaning that they are different in different contexts. Developing a multilevel model In order to conduct a multilevel model analysis, one would start with fixed coefficients (slopes and intercepts). One aspect would be allowed to vary at a time (that is, would be changed), and compared with the previous model in order to assess better model fit. There are three different questions that a researcher would ask in assessing a model. First, is it a good model? Second, is a more complex model better? Third, what contribution do individual predictors make to the model? In order to assess models, different model fit statistics would be examined. One such statistic is the chi-square likelihood-ratio test, which assesses the difference between models. The likelihood-ratio test can be employed for model building in general, for examining what happens when effects in a model are allowed to vary, and when testing a dummy-coded categorical variable as a single effect. However, the test can only be used when models are nested (meaning that a more complex model includes all of the effects of a simpler model). When testing non-nested models, comparisons between models can be made using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), among others. See further Model selection. Assumptions Multilevel models have the same assumptions as other major general linear models (e.g., ANOVA, regression), but some of the assumptions are modified for the hierarchical nature of the design (i.e., nested data). ;Linearity The assumption of linearity states that there is a rectilinear (straight-line, as opposed to non-linear or U-shaped) relationship between variables. However, the model can be extended to nonlinear relationships. ;Normality The assumption of normality states that the error terms at every level of the model are normally distributed.. However, most statistical software allows one to specify different distributions for the variance terms, such as a Poisson, binomial, logistic. The multilevel modelling approach can be used for all forms of Generalized Linear models. ;Homoscedasticity The assumption of homoscedasticity, also known as homogeneity of variance, assumes equality of population variances. However, different variance-correlation matrix can be specified to account for this, and the heterogeneity of variance can itself be modeled. ;Independence of observations Independence is an assumption of general linear models, which states that cases are random samples from the population and that scores on the dependent variable are independent of each other. One of the main purposes of multilevel models is to deal with cases where the assumption of independence is violated; multilevel models do, however, assume that 1) the level 1 and level 2 residuals are uncorrelated and 2) The errors (as measured by the residuals) at the highest level are uncorrelated. Statistical tests The type of statistical tests that are employed in multilevel models depend on whether one is examining fixed effects or variance components. When examining fixed effects, the tests are compared with the standard error of the fixed effect, which results in a Z-test. A t-test can also be computed. When computing a t-test, it is important to keep in mind the degrees of freedom, which will depend on the level of the predictor (e.g., level 1 predictor or level 2 predictor). For a level 1 predictor, the degrees of freedom are based on the number of level 1 predictors, the number of groups and the number of individual observations. For a level 2 predictor, the degrees of freedom are based on the number of level 2 predictors and the number of groups. Statistical power Statistical power for multilevel models differs depending on whether it is level 1 or level 2 effects that are being examined. Power for level 1 effects is dependent upon the number of individual observations, whereas the power for level 2 effects is dependent upon the number of groups. To conduct research with sufficient power, large sample sizes are required in multilevel models. However, the number of individual observations in groups is not as important as the number of groups in a study. In order to detect cross-level interactions, given that the group sizes are not too small, recommendations have been made that at least 20 groups are needed. The issue of statistical power in multilevel models is complicated by the fact that power varies as a function of effect size and intraclass correlations, it differs for fixed effects versus random effects, and it changes depending on the number of groups and the number of individual observations per group. Applications Level The concept of level is the keystone of this approach. In an educational research example, the levels for a 2-level model might be: #pupil #class However, if one were studying multiple schools and multiple school districts, a 4-level model could be: #pupil #class #school #district The researcher must establish for each variable the level at which it was measured. In this example \\"test score\\" might be measured at pupil level, \\"teacher experience\\" at class level, \\"school funding\\" at school level, and \\"urban\\" at district level. Example As a simple example, consider a basic linear regression model that predicts income as a function of age, class, gender and race. It might then be observed that income levels also vary depending on the city and state of residence. A simple way to incorporate this into the regression model would be to add an additional independent categorical variable to account for the location (i.e. a set of additional binary predictors and associated regression coefficients, one per location). This would have the effect of shifting the mean income up or down‚Äîbut it would still assume, for example, that the effect of race and gender on income is the same everywhere. In reality, this is unlikely to be the case‚Äîdifferent local laws, different retirement policies, differences in level of racial prejudice, etc. are likely to cause all of the predictors to have different sorts of effects in different locales. In other words, a simple linear regression model might, for example, predict that a given randomly sampled person in Seattle would have an average yearly income $10,000 higher than a similar person in Mobile, Alabama. However, it would also predict, for example, that a white person might have an average income $7,000 above a black person, and a 65-year-old might have an income $3,000 below a 45-year-old, in both cases regardless of location. A multilevel model, however, would allow for different regression coefficients for each predictor in each location. Essentially, it would assume that people in a given location have correlated incomes generated by a single set of regression coefficients, whereas people in another location have incomes generated by a different set of coefficients. Meanwhile, the coefficients themselves are assumed to be correlated and generated from a single set of hyperparameters. Additional levels are possible: For example, people might be grouped by cities, and the city-level regression coefficients grouped by state, and the state-level coefficients generated from a single hyper-hyperparameter. Multilevel models are a subclass of hierarchical Bayesian models, which are general models with multiple levels of random variables and arbitrary relationships among the different variables. Multilevel analysis has been extended to include multilevel structural equation modeling, multilevel latent class modeling, and other more general models. Uses Multilevel models have been used in education research or geographical research, to estimate separately the variance between pupils within the same school, and the variance between schools. In psychological applications, the multiple levels are items in an instrument, individuals, and families. In sociological applications, multilevel models are used to examine individuals embedded within regions or countries. In organizational psychology research, data from individuals must often be nested within teams or other functional units. Different covariables may be relevant on different levels. They can be used for longitudinal studies, as with growth studies, to separate changes within one individual and differences between individuals. Cross-level interactions may also be of substantive interest; for example, when a slope is allowed to vary randomly, a level-2 predictor may be included in the slope formula for the level-1 covariate. For example, one may estimate the interaction of race and neighborhood so that an estimate of the interaction between an individual's characteristics and the context. Applications to longitudinal (repeated measures) data Alternative ways of analyzing hierarchical data There are several alternative ways of analyzing hierarchical data, although most of them have some problems. First, traditional statistical techniques can be used. One could disaggregate higher- order variables to the individual level, and thus conduct an analysis on this individual level (for example, assign class variables to the individual level). The problem with this approach is that it would violate the assumption of independence, and thus could bias our results. This is known as atomistic fallacy. Another way to analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches is to aggregate individual level variables to higher-order variables and then to conduct an analysis on this higher level. The problem with this approach is that it discards all within-group information (because it takes the average of the individual level variables). As much as 80‚Äì90% of the variance could be wasted, and the relationship between aggregated variables is inflated, and thus distorted. This is known as ecological fallacy, and statistically, this type of analysis results in decreased power in addition to the loss of information. Another way to analyze hierarchical data would be through a random-coefficients model. This model assumes that each group has a different regression model‚Äîwith its own intercept and slope. Because groups are sampled, the model assumes that the intercepts and slopes are also randomly sampled from a population of group intercepts and slopes. This allows for an analysis in which one can assume that slopes are fixed but intercepts are allowed to vary. However this presents a problem, as individual components are independent but group components are independent between groups, but dependent within groups. This also allows for an analysis in which the slopes are random; however, the correlations of the error terms (disturbances) are dependent on the values of the individual-level variables. Thus, the problem with using a random-coefficients model in order to analyze hierarchical data is that is still not possible to incorporate higher order variables. Error terms Multilevel models have two error terms, which are also known as disturbances. The individual components are all independent, but there are also group components, which are independent between groups but correlated within groups. However, variance components can differ, as some groups are more homogeneous than others.

The Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act, 2064, Act Number 5 of the Year 2064 (2008), criminalises prostitution and living of the earnings of prostitution by including it in the definition of human trafficking. UNAIDS estimate there to be 67,300 prostitutes in the country. Government policies Although there are no laws in Nepal criminalizing sex work specifically, there are some laws that were enacted throughout the 1980s that criminalize trafficking within and outside of Nepal that are used towards sex work. Many of these laws are sometimes interpreted to accuse sex workers as well, which comes from a lack of knowledge in the distinction between the sex trafficking scene and sex work. Sex work is a term used to refer to all aspects of the lawful and unlawful sex industries around the world. There are various forms of sex work, including physical and verbal forms. This distinction is one that is not truly understood; thus, many of the policies and laws enacted within Nepal against trafficking‚Äîmany argue‚Äîshould not be applied to sex work. Authorities and laws trying to stop true slavery‚Äîtrafficking‚Äîget misapplied to sex workers, clients and others involved in the sex industry. In 1986, the Traffic in Humans (Control) Act was passed in Nepal and was aimed at stopping trafficking in the form of prostitution. However, this act, like many others, proved to be ineffective, mainly due to the fact that the act was ‚Äúlargely aimed at criminalizing prostitution rather than curbing trafficking activities.‚Äù In 2008, the Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act, criminalised prostitution and living of the earnings of prostitution by including it in the definition of human trafficking. Reasons for entering the sex industry For many, entering into the sex industry is the only way in which they could survive economically in Nepal. However, sex work is not officially recognized among the industrial or service sectors of labor. There is a large case of sex trafficking in Nepal, but voluntary sex work is more common than many believe. Among the developing poor nations throughout Southeast Asia today, Nepal remains one of the most poverty-stricken. Research shows that about 38% of the Nepali population is living under US$1 per day, and 82% under US$2 per day. Due to this high rate of poverty, the rural poor Nepalese people generally have large families, are landless or have very small landholdings, have high rates of illiteracy and are concentrated in specific ethnic, caste and minority groups. These issues of poverty are part of why many people, including both cisgender and transgender men and women, go into the sex industry in Nepal. Due to their large families, these sex workers need to find a way to help out within the household. More specifically, there are not many opportunities for the women sex workers, and women in general, to break out of the domestic environment and duties which have left them in poverty, so the only option left for them is going into sex work. Nepal, like many other Southeast Asian countries, has a limited amount of resources for women. Recently, the Nepalese government has recognized more rights for women in terms of family involvement, physical integrity, ownership rights, and overall civil liberties. However, this does not change the fact that women are still highly underrepresented in Nepalese society, and do not have the same rights that men do. Women constitute a majority of these sex workers, because they rarely have any opportunities otherwise. These women may feel empowered by the work that they do, in the sense that they can better provide for their families, and be seen for something other than what society treats women. In some cases, girls that are put into the sex industry are forced to migrate to carpet factories outside of Nepal or in more centralized cities by their families to better provide for them. After a while, they are either abducted into the traffic scene, or coerced to join. The issue of poverty has driven many families in Nepal to desperation, to the point of putting their daughters out on the streets to earn money to help out in the home. Human trafficking in Nepal‚Äîmore specifically, sex trafficking‚Äîis a common precursor to voluntary sex work. After escaping from the sex trafficking world, women return to sex work when they return to Nepal, for it is the only thing they know. Consequences of sex work Sex work in Nepal can be a short-term relief to the poverty and struggles encountered by these hundreds of women on a daily basis. The long-term effects bring a new perspective to sex work, and are a big part of the argument against sex work. Short-term consequences Many people go into the sex work field in hopes of finding a better opportunity for their families and for themselves. This is especially true in Nepal, which is ranked as one of the countries with the lowest human development indicators in the world, ranked 143 in the United Nations Human Development Index, with an HDI of 0.458. Because sex workers usually belong to the lower castes of the caste system within Nepal (a survey conducted by UN Nepal, showed that the majority of the sex workers were from Tamangs and Dalits), India, and other Southeast Asian countries, they feel as though sex work is the only opportunity that they truly have to better their lives and that of their families. The Nepalese caste system makes it very difficult for people of any class to rise up to a higher class. There have been rare instances in which members of a specific class have risen, and even in these cases, the members only rise within their own caste (see also Nepalese caste system). Due to this social trap, sex work is seen as a way to escape from the social organization. Sex work can allow those in lower castes to provide for their family in a different way. In the short-term, going into the sex industry would seem like a logical solution, since the money that many of these sex workers make can go towards the improvement of their families. Long-term consequences Sex workers are exposed to a variety of serious risks, including: sexually transmitted diseases, a decrease in security, and a loss of human rights. Sexually transmitted diseases Nepal faces increasing HIV prevalence among most at-risk populations (MARPs) such as sex workers, injecting drug users (IDUs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and migrants. Since 1988, when the first case of HIV/AIDS in Nepal was reported, more than 1,750 cases of AIDS and over 11,000 cases of HIV infection were officially reported. Since Nepal is limited in terms of its public health surveillance system, the actual number of infections throughout the country is said to be more. UNAIDS estimates that approximately 30,000 people were living with HIV in 2018. HIV prevalence amongst sex workers was estimated to be 4.2%, compated to 0.1% for the general population Compromised security The entry of women into sex work can sometimes take an unexpected turn. Although some women go into the sex industry voluntarily, they can end up being taken into the larger sex trafficking scene to India and surrounding areas. The trafficking of women and girls to India is a major problem which has made international news. Every year, a rough estimate of about 7,000 Nepali girls are trafficked to India, where they are forced into prostitution. Nepalese women and girls, especially virgins, are favored in India, because of their fair skin and young looks (see also Human trafficking in Nepal). Since the policy of an open border between China and Nepal, a large number of Nepalese women in recent years have been sold into prostitution or as brides to Chinese men.Kathmandu opens borders with China and triggers slave trade Aside from being kidnapped into the trafficking scene, sex workers run the risk of being abused sexually against their will. When things like this happen, it is hard for these sex workers to get protection, because they are seen as criminals. This is one of the reasons that many are fighting to legalize voluntary sex work. Many argue that these people deserve protection against harm, just like those that are taken into the trafficking scene. Loss of human rights When living a life in the sex industry, many argue that the risk of losing human rights is common. Many times, especially in Nepal, the sex industry is run by organized crime. The sex industry contributes between 2‚Äì14% of gross domestic product in countries such as Nepal. Due to this, there is a great incentive for corruption as far as within officials and the police. ‚ÄúThis puts women sex workers in vulnerable positions because the institution mandated to protect people either ignores their problems or takes part in the abuse.‚Äù If sex workers were to challenge the authority of these officials‚Äîeven by demanding control over their own bodies‚Äîthey are running the risk of being punished within the community and even the law. This is another controversial issue, in that the suppliers are always the ones being punished, while the demand sector of this industry seems to get away with their equally incriminating actions. Sex trafficking Nepal is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Nepali women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in Nepal, India, the Middle East, Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Unregistered migrants, including the large number of Nepalis who travel through India or rely on unregistered recruiting agents, are particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Some migrants from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and possibly other countries transit Nepal en route to employment in the Middle East, using potentially falsified Nepali travel documents, and may be subjected to human trafficking. Some government officials reportedly accept bribes to include false information in Nepali identity documents or provide fraudulent documents to prospective labor migrants, a tactic used by unscrupulous recruiters to evade recruitment regulations. Many Nepalis, including children, whose home or livelihood was destroyed by the 2015 earthquakes continue to be vulnerable to trafficking. Traffickers increasingly utilize social media and mobile technologies to lure and deceive their victims. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Nepal as a 'Tier 2' country.

It commenced on 12 January 1848, and therefore was the first of the numerous revolutions to occur that year. Three revolutions against Bourbon rule had previously occurred on the island of Sicily starting from 1800: this final one resulted in an independent state surviving for 16 months. The constitution that survived the 16 months was quite advanced for its time in liberal democratic terms, as was the proposal of an Italian confederation of states. It was in effect a curtain raiser to the end of the Bourbon kingdom of the Two Sicilies which was started by Giuseppe Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand in 1860 and culminated with the Siege of Gaeta of 1860‚Äì1861. The revolution Background Flag used by Sicilians during the revolution. The former kingdoms of Naples and Sicily were formally reunited following the 1815 Congress of Vienna to become the Bourbon kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Both kingdoms had previously comprised the single Kingdom of Sicily (created by the Normans in the 11th century) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and were split in two following the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282. The seeds of the revolution of 1848 were sown prior to the Congress of Vienna, in 1814. This was during the tumultuous Napoleonic period when the Bourbon court was forced to escape from Naples and set up its royal court in Palermo with the assistance of the English navy. The Sicilian nobles were able to take the opportunity to force on the Bourbons a new constitution for Sicily that was based on the Westminster system of parliamentary government, and was in fact quite a liberal constitution for the time. However, post Congress of Vienna, Ferdinand IV of Naples (and III of Sicily) immediately abolished the constitution upon returning the royal court to Naples. Political events after the revolution Ruggero Settimo. The 1848 revolution was substantially organized from, and centered in, Palermo. The popular nature of the revolt is evident in the fact that posters and notices were being handed out a full three days before the substantive acts of the revolution occurred on 12 January, 1848. The timing was deliberately planned to coincide with the birthday of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, himself born in Palermo in 1810 (during the Napoleonic period mentioned above). The Sicilian nobles were immediately able to resuscitate the constitution of 1812, which included the principles of representative democracy and the centrality of Parliament in the government of the state. Vincenzo Fardella was elected president of Sicilian Parliament. The idea was also put forward for a confederation of all the states of Italy. However the Sicilian Parliament was never able to control the well fortified city of Messina, which ultimately would be used to take back the island by force. Similarly, it was the city of Messina that held out the longest against Garibaldi‚Äôs attack on the island in 1860. Thus Sicily survived as a quasi- independent state for sixteen months, with the Bourbon army taking back full control of the island on 15 May 1849 by force. The effective head of state during this period was Ruggero Settimo. On capitulating to the Bourbons, Settimo escaped to Malta where he was received with the full honours of a head of state. He remained exiled there for the rest of his life and died there in 1863. Upon the formation of the new Kingdom of Italy in 1861, Settimo was offered the position of first President of the Senate of the newly created national parliament, but he was forced to decline for health reasons. Nevertheless, this invitation provides more than a casual hint as to the nexus that existed between the events of 1848 and 1860-61 in the History of Italy. The Revolution which began in Palermo was one of a series of such events in Italy, though perhaps more violent than others. It quickly spread across the island and throughout Italy, where it prompted Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, to follow the example of Ferdinand II and issue a hastily written constitution. In imitation of these events, riots and revolutions followed around Europe at the same time, and may be considered a taste of the socialist revolts to come.

Kim is best known as the author of the New York Times #1 best selling Hollows series, but she has written more than urban fantasy and has published over two dozen books spanning the gamut from young adult, accelerated-science thriller, anthology, and a unique, full-color world book, and has scripted two original graphic novels set in the Hollows universe. She has also published traditional fantasy under the name Dawn Cook. The Rachel Morgan urban fantasy series is set in an alternate history in which a worldwide pandemic caused by genetically modified tomatoes led to the death of a large portion of the world's human population. Under the name of Dawn Cook, she writes the Decoy Princess and Truth series, published in the first few years of the 21st century. Harrison has received praise from fellow authors, and has reached the #1 spot on the New York Times Best Seller list. On May 16, 2019, Harrison announced on social media that a new novel, American Demon, will be forthcoming in the summer of 2020. Early life Kim Harrison was born and raised in the Midwest. A self-proclaimed \\"former tomboy,\\" she grew up the only girl in a family of boys. Despite her love of writing, she took an unorthodox approach to it, and claims to have avoided English courses beyond the basic requirements in high school and college. Career Harrison began her career with writing traditional science fiction, but began writing contemporary fantasy after deciding to focus more on character development. She spent the better part of a decade struggling as an aspiring author before meeting her current agent at a writing convention. He then introduced her to Diana Gill, who became Harrison's editor. Together, they produced Dead Witch Walking, and her first book was published in paperback by HarperTorch in 2004. Since then, she has written twelve more books, two graphic novels, and extensive world book in the Hollows series, also called the Rachel Morgan series, (most with titles punning off Clint Eastwood movies) and contributed to multiple anthologies, with prequels to the Hollows books, and one with a young adult story. After the success of her first novel, Harrison was able to resign from her day job, devoting herself to writing full-time. Her favorite author is Ray Bradbury. She references music as one of her strongest writing influences, providing song lists for several of her characters. In her spare time, she communicates with fans via her self-maintained website and blog. Harrison is a member of the International Thriller Writers.http://thrillerwriters.org/members/ The first two Truth books were originally one book, which was split into two separate books for publishing. That the two are the same, and that Cook was Harrison, was disclosed in a May 2009 Locus magazine article. > \\"I'm glad it's out in the open, because it is hard to maintain these two > separate identities, and remind your friends or family when you go out, 'I'm > Kim today, so don't call me Dawn.' The division has served its purpose. I'm > still going to be Kim, but now if somebody calls me Dawn I won't have to say > 'Shut your mouth!'\\" Reception Harrison has reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list and is generally recognized as one of the most successful and influential creators of urban fantasy. Her writing has garnered praise from numerous peers. Authors Kelly Gay and Courtney Allison Moulton have cited her as an inspiration. The Hollows series has also gained recognition from The New York Times and Amazon.com. In 2007, Amazon.com noted that Harrison had become \\"one of the hottest authors in the incredibly popular genre of sexy supernaturalism.\\" Bibliography as Kim Harrison  The Hollows universe  The Turn Novels (Hollows prequel) #The Turn: The Hollows begins with Death (February 7, 2017, ) Rachel Morgan / The Hollows Novels #Dead Witch Walking (April 2004, ) #The Good, the Bad, and the Undead (January 2005, ) #Every Which Way But Dead (June 28, 2005, ) #A Fistful of Charms (June 27, 2006, ) #For a Few Demons More (March 20, 2007, ) #The Outlaw Demon Wails (Where Demons Dare in the UK) (February 26, 2008, ) #White Witch, Black Curse (February 24, 2009, ) #Black Magic Sanction (February 23, 2010, ) #Pale Demon (February 22, 2011, ) #A Perfect Blood (February 21, 2012, ) #Ever After (January 22, 2013, )\\"The Books, , Revised: 01/09/2013.

The groups model their discussions from the book of the same name by Christopher Phillips and a guide he also developed. Today, there are hundreds of such gatherings, coordinated by volunteers, worldwide.Socrates Caf√© official website, the official website of the Socrates Caf√© movement History Socrates Caf√©s began in 1996, when Christopher Phillips, then a freelance writer and editorial consultant, desired to in some way build on the legacy of historical thinkers. He proposed Socratic dialogues with anyone who wished to become more empathetic, and more objectively critical and creative philosophical inquirers. Phillips' idea of having open-invitation meetings at cafes and other public places and spaces was inspired by Matthew Lipman, the founder of the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children who advocated introducing philosophy into schools and under whom Phillips studied, as well as by Marc Sautet, whose Caf√© Philosophique Phillips became aware of after reading an article about Sautet in 1995.Montclair State University, Insight, 15 September 1997 ; Bill Workman, \\"San Bruno Thinker Spurs Robust Chatter in Cafes\\", San Francisco Chronicle, 21 May 1998; both accessed 20 Oct 2008. According to Phillips, his version of the Socratic Method was inspired not only by the Greek interrogative elements practiced by Socrates of the elenctic (Greek for 'cross examination,' 'encounter,' 'inquiry'), aporia (Greek for 'doubt') and maieutic (Greek for 'midwifery,' in this case giving birth to ideas one harbors from within), but by the philosopher Justus Buchler's notions of human judgment and query, by philosopher Walter Kaufmann's notion of the \\"Socratic type\\" and view that the Socratic Method boils down to the sustained consideration of objections and alternatives to any given way of seeing things, as well as by Hannah Arendt's notion of the Socratic persona and performativity. A typical Socrates Cafe group meets in a public place, is open to anyone who wishes to attend, and Socratically explores a question which is chosen by vote or which is announced shortly in advance. Typically there are no prerequisites, and no reading or other preparation is required. Socrates Cafe Society www.Meetup.com/Socrates-Cafe- Society Socratic method Janet Sisson, a philosophy professor at Mount Royal College,http://www.mtroyal.ca/ProgramsCourses/FacultiesSchoolsCentres/Arts/Departments/Humanities/Faculty/jsisson.htm has questioned the appropriateness of identifying the methods and goals practiced by Phillips with those of the historical Socrates: \\"...the background for this enterprise [Socrates Caf√©] is very different from that for the conversations of Socrates. Plato uses the figure of Socrates as a way of introducing the idea of intellectual discussion in order to promote the pursuit of truth, not as a path for personal discovery. ...To treat opportunities for dialogue as a means of self-discovery is a modern attitude, not the aim of Socrates own original dialectic. American scholars have sometimes encouraged this reading of Socratic endeavors; Phillips' fondness for this line of argument perhaps owes more to idealist or existentialist thinking than to Socrates himself.\\" Sisson goes on to stress that \\"(t)his does not undermine the aim of Phillips' cafes...\\"Review of Socrates Caf√©, Metapsychology, Vol. 7 No. 21, 25 May 2003, accessed 13 May 2008. Philosopher Thomas Morris has praised the Socrates Cafe concept of good discussion about important topics by common people.Morris, Thomas. The Socrates Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy, Morris Institute of Human Values, accessed 2008-10-13 David Blacker, professor of Philosophy of Education and Legal Studies at the University of Delaware, writes in Democratic Education Stretched Thin: How Complexity Challenges a Liberal Ideal (2007), that \\"one can...only applaud the efforts initiated by Christopher Phillips... In very much an extra-academic (but not anti-academic) spirit, Phillips has inspired individuals to create in their own communities voluntary groups who convene to discuss philosophical questions they themselves have chosen.\\" (p. 146) Blacker considers the Socrates cafe endeavor to be a critical effort for evolving a democracy, the essential function and mission of which to him is for its citizens \\"to think for themselves about the lives they want to lead\\" (p. 146).

She was a member representing Rajasthan from July 2004 to July 2010. She was nominated by the BJP for the Rajya Sabha in 2012 from Madhya Pradesh, and assumed her office on 24 April 2012. She is a second cousin to actor Aamir Khan and grand niece of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. She contested the 13th vice-presidential election held in August 2007 but lost to Hamid Ansari by 233 votes. She took oath as a cabinet minister in the Narendra Modi headed government on 26 May 2014 and was replaced by Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in July 2016.  Early life and background  Najma was born as Sayyida Najma bint Yusuf on 13 April 1940 in Bhopal, Bhopal State, in present Madhya Pradesh to Sayyid Yusuf bin Ali AlHashmi and Sayyida Fatima bint Mahmood. She is a Dawoodi Bohra Ismaili Shia Gujarati Muslim with Arab ancestry, as traced by her ancestral roots in the Arabian peninsula as well as Gujarat state. She did her schooling at Motilal Vigyan Mahavidyalaya (MVM) Bhopal, and obtained an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. degree, both in Zoology (Cardiac Anatomy) from Vikram University, Ujjain. She married Akbar Ali Akhtar Heptulla in 1966, and has three daughters. Her husband, Akbar Ali Akhtar Heptulla, a manpower consultant, was instrumental in the establishment of the Patriot newspaper in the 1960s. He died on 4 September 2007, in New Delhi at the age of 75.  Career  She steadily climbed up in the Indian National Congress party, heading several divisions of the party's grassroots organisations. She was the General Secretary of Congress during 1986 with the additional responsibility of youth activities of the All India Congress Committee and the NSUI. Since 1980, she has been a member of the Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra for four terms at 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998 as Congress candidate. Najma was the Deputy Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha from January 1985 to January 1986 and from 1988 to July 2004. Heptulla was nominated to head the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, ICCR. She also presided over the women parliamentarians' group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 1993 and became founder president of the parliamentarians' forum for human development the same year. She was also elected President of Inter- Parliamentary Union (IPU), a Geneva-based international organisation at Council's 165th session in Berlin in 1999. She held the post from 16 October 1999 to 27 September 2002. Subsequently, in 2002, at Council's 171st session, she was chosen the Honorary President of the IPU Council. Heptulla was nominated by the United Nations Development Programme as its human development ambassador. Heptulla led a delegation to the UN Commission on Status of Women in 1997. Heptulla has authored book on AIDS titled \\"AIDS: Approaches to Prevention\\". She has also written on human social security, sustainable development, environment, reforms for women and on ties between India and west Asia. Heptulla joined Bharatiya Janata Party in 2004. Media sources reported that she left the Congress apparently due to a strain in relationship with Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Later she alleged that she was personally humiliated by Sonia Gandhi. She declared that she was leaving the party due to the problems with party leadership. In 2007, BJP-led NDA fielded her a candidate in elections for the Vice-President of India, which was won by Hamid Ansari Heptulla faced charges of having morphed a 1958 photograph to show her along with Maulana Abul Kalam Azad in a publication of the Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR). The controversial photograph was published in an ICCR publication titled 'Journey of a legend', on the life of Maulana Azad, a noted scholar and the country's first education minister. He was also the first chairperson of the ICCR and the publication came out when the council was headed by Heptulla. The photograph came with an introduction and showed a young Heptulla with the Maulana. The caption read \\"Najma Heptulla with Maulana Azad after her graduation\\". This gave the game away as official inquiries later revealed Heptulla had graduated in May 1958, whereas the Maulana had died on February 22, 1958. The publication was later withdrawn by the ICCR and its revised version is released but without the controversial photograph. Delhi High court had directed the CBI to investigate the case on a public interest litigation filed by ICCR Employees Association president. Under Nitin Gadkari as BJP President, she became one of the 13 vice-presidents of the BJP in 2010, where later when Rajnath Singh took over, she was made a member of the party's national executive. Heptulla served as the Minister of Minority Affairs in Prime minister Narendra Modi's cabinet from 26 May 2014 to 12 July 2016. She said that minorities needed a level playing field in Indian society, but reservation is not the solution as it kills the spirit of competition.

His preoccupation with Jewish elements and his desire to develop a \\"Jewish\\" harmonic and contrapuntal idiom, underscored and informed much of his work. His friend, the composer Arnold Schoenberg, described Achron in his obituary as \\"one of the most underrated modern composers\\".From the Album: Remembrances, Album NotesLevin, Neil. Liner notes to the Naxos recording of his Violin Concerto No. 1, Naxos 8.5559408 Biography Achron as a youth Achron was born in Lozdzieje, Russian Empire (now Lazdijai, Lithuania) to Julian and Bertha and began the study of the violin under his father, an amateur violinist, at the age of five. His first public performance followed three years later at age seven in Warsaw. This was followed by a prodigious childhood career including performances throughout Russia. Between 1899 and 1904 he studied violin under Leopold Auer and composition under Anatoly Ljadov, at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. He joined the Society for Jewish Folk Music in 1911 and from that point occupied himself in theory and practice with the Jewish music tradition. His first \\"Jewish\\" work, Hebrew Melody, became immediately recognized through the interpretation of violinist Jascha Heifetz. In 1913, Achron became the head of the violin and chamber music departments at the Kharkiv Conservatory in Ukraine, and served in the Russian Army between 1916 and 1918. In the years after World War I, he toured extensively as a concert artist in Europe, the Near East and Russia, performing over 1000 concerts between 1919 and 1922. During this period he was appointed head of the violin masterclass and chamber music department at the Leningrad Artists' Union. In 1922, Achron moved to Berlin, where together with Mikhail Gnessin he ran the Jewish music publishing company Yivneh. In 1924, Achron spent some months in Palestine. In 1925, he emigrated to the United States and settled in New York, where he taught the violin at the Westchester Conservatory. He performed his Violin Concerto No. 1 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1927. His incidental music suite from H. Leivick's The Golem, also written during this period, was chosen by the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) for performance in Venice in 1932. In 1934, he moved to Hollywood, where he composed music for films and continued his career as a concert violinist. He performed his Violin Concerto No. 2 with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in 1936 and his third ‚Äì commissioned by Jascha Heifetz ‚Äì with the same orchestra in 1939. Atonality and polytonality are among the techniques used in his later works. His final work was the Concerto for solo piano, Op. 74. He died in Hollywood in 1943 and is buried in Hollywood Forever Cemetery. A year after his death the Joseph Achron Memorial Committee was formed, which included twenty well-known composers, instrumentalists, conductors and critics.New York Times Article He was the older brother of the concert pianist and composer Isidor Achron, who became Jascha Heifetz's accompanist for more than ten years.

They are the descendants of Old Indo-Aryan (attested in Vedic Sanskrit) and the predecessors of the modern Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindustani (Hindi- Urdu), Odia, Assamese, Maithili, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali and Punjabi. The Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA) stage in the evolution of Indo-Aryan languages is thought to have spanned more than a millennium between 600 BCE and 1000 CE, and is often divided into three major subdivisions. * The early stage is represented by the Ardhamagadhi of the Edicts of Ashoka (c. 250 BC) and Jain Agamas, and by the Pali of the Tripitakas. * The middle stage is represented by the various literary Prakrits, especially the Shauraseni language and Maharashtri and Magadhi Prakrits. The term Prakrit is also often applied to Middle Indo-Aryan languages (prƒÅk·πõta literally means \\"natural\\" as opposed to sa·πÉsk·πõta, which literally means \\"constructed\\" or \\"refined\\"). Modern scholars such as Michael C. Shapiro follow this classification by including all Middle Indo-Aryan languages under the rubric of \\"Prakrits\\", while others emphasise the independent development of these languages, often separated from Sanskrit by social and geographic differences.Shapiro, Michael C. Hindi. _Facts about the world's languages: An encyclopedia of the world's major languages, past and present._ Ed. Jane Garry, and Carl Rubino: New England Publishing Associates, 2001. * The late stage is represented by the Apabhra·πÉ≈õas of the 6th century and later that preceded early Modern Indo-Aryan languagesBubenik, Vit (2007). \\"Chapter Six: PrƒÅkrits and Apabhra·πÉ≈õa\\". In Jain, Danesh; Cardona, George. The Indo-Aryan Languages. Routledge. p. 209. .Shapiro, Hindi. (such as Braj Bhasha). History The Indo-Aryan languages are commonly assigned to three major groups - Old Indo-Aryan languages, Middle Indo-Aryan languages and Early Modern and Modern Indo-Aryan languages. The classification reflects stages in linguistic development, rather than being strictly chronological. The Middle Indo-Aryan languages are younger than the Old Indo-Aryan languages\\"The most archaic Old Indo-Aryan is found in Hindu sacred texts called the Vedas, which date to approximately 1500 BCE\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Indo-Aryan languages. General characteristics. but were contemporaneous with the use of Classical Sanskrit, an Old Indo-Aryan language used for literary purposes.\\"If in \\"Sanskrit\\" we include the Vedic language and all dialects of the Old Indian period, then it is true to say that all the Prakrits are derived from Sanskrit. If on the other hand \\" Sanskrit \\" is used more strictly of the Panini-Patanjali language or \\"Classical Sanskrit,\\" then it is untrue to say that any Prakrit is derived from Sanskrit, except that S'auraseni, the Midland Prakrit, is derived from the Old Indian dialect\\". Introduction to Prakrit, by Alfred C Woolner. Baptist Mission Press 1917 According to Thomas Oberlies, a number of morphophonological and lexical features of Middle Indo-Aryan languages show that they are not direct continuations of Vedic Sanskrit. Instead they descend from other dialects similar to, but in some ways more archaic than Vedic Sanskrit. Early phase: 3rd century BCE *Ashokan Prakrits (3rd century BCE; regional dialects) * Gandhari (a Buddhist canonical language) *Pali (a Buddhist canonical language) *early Ardha-Magadhi (language of the oldest Jain sutras) Middle phase (200 BCE to 700 CE) *Niya Prakrit *Ardha-Magadhi (later Jain canon) *Dramatic Prakrits (Maurya period) **Maharashtri **Magadhi **Sauraseni *Elu *Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (later texts) Late phase: Apabhramsa (700-1500) *Abahatta (Magadhi Apabhramsa) *Elu Innovation A Middle Indo-Aryan innovation are the serial verb constructions that have evolved into complex predicates in modern north Indian languages such as Hindi and Bengali. For example, ‡§≠‡§æ‡§ó ‡§ú‡§æ (bhƒÅg jƒÅ) 'go run' means run away, ‡§™‡§ï‡§æ ‡§≤‡•á (pakƒÅ le) 'take cook' means to cook for oneself, and ‡§™‡§ï‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á (pakƒÅ de) 'give cook' means to cook for someone. The second verb restricts the meaning of the main verb or adds a shade of meaning to it. Subsequently, the second verb was grammaticalised further into what is known as a light verb, mainly used to convey lexical aspect distinctions for the main verb. The innovation is based on Sanskrit atmanepadi (fruit of the action accrues to the doer) and parasmaipadi verbs (fruit of the action accrues to some other than the doer). For example, ‡§™‡§ï‡§æ ‡§¶‡•á (pakƒÅ de) 'give cook' has the result of the action (cooked food) going to someone else, and ‡§™‡§ï‡§æ ‡§≤‡•á (pakƒÅ le) 'take cook' to the one who is doing the cooking. PƒÅli Pali is the best attested of the Middle Indo- Aryan languages because of the extensive writings of early Buddhists. These include canonical texts, canonical developments such as Abhidhamma, and a thriving commentarial tradition associated with figures such as Buddhaghosa. Early PƒÅli texts, such as the Sutta-nipƒÅta contain many \\"Magadhisms\\" (such as heke for eke; or masculine nominative singular in -e). PƒÅli continued to be a living second language until well into the second millennium. The Pali Text Society was founded in 1881 by T. W. Rhys Davids to preserve, edit, and publish texts in PƒÅli, as well as English translations.

Claus, Sarah Diamond, Margaret Ann Mills, Routledge, 2003, p. 203 GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ Many texts in Kharo·π£·π≠hi script have been discovered in the area centred on the Khyber Pass in what was known in ancient times as Gandhara and the language of the texts came to be called GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´. These are largely Buddhist texts which parallel the PƒÅli Canon, but include MahƒÅyƒÅna texts as well. The language is distinct from other MI dialects. Apabhramsa An apabhramsa (also: avahatta) was a language developed from Prakrits.BPT Vagish Shastri, Bundelkhand Ki Prachinta, Vidvad Gosthi, 1965, Varanasi, India.Devendra Kumar Jain, Apabhramsa Bhasa aur Sahitya, Bhartiya Jnanapitha Prakashan, 1966, Calcutta, India.P.D.Gune, An Introduction to Comparative Philology, Poona Oriental BookHouse, 1959, Poona, India. Modern Provincial languages developed from different apabhramsas. Patanjali was the first to use the term apabhramsa in his Mahabhasya (200 BC). The term is derived from the Sanskrit word Apabhrasta,R.A.Pandey and R.N. Mishra, Pali Prakrat-Apabhramsa Sangraha, Vishwavidyalaya Prakashan, 1968, Varanasi, India and means a corrupted form of Sanskrit. Mostly Jain religious language and spiritual literature of Siddhas was composed in Apabhramsa language. When the Romani people migrated from Rajasthan, Punjab, Sindh and Afghanistan in the 1st century AD, they were speaking an apabhramsa language pertaining to the Western part of India. They spread to Western countries around the 12th century AD.Vagish Shastri, Gypsy language and grammar, Vol XXI, Yogic Voice Consciousness Institute, 2004, Varanasi, India Apabhramsa poets Literary work in apabhramsa appeared in 8th century AD.

Before being expelled from it and turning independent in 2015, he was a long-time member of Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord. Political career Having joined Liga Veneta (LV) in 1991, Tosi was elected to the Municipal Council of Verona in 1994 at the age of 25. From 1997 to 2003 he was also provincial secretary of the LV in the Province of Verona. In the meantime, in the 2000 regional election he was elected to the Regional Council of Veneto, where he served as the party's floor leader for two years. After being the most voted candidate in the 2005 regional election (more than 28,000 of personal votes), he was appointed regional minister of Health in Galan III Government. Aged 36, he was one of the LV's rising stars, alongside Luca Zaia, who was contextually appointed Vice President and soon became his main rival within the party. In late 2006 Tosi launched his bid for mayor of Verona. Initially he was supported only by his party, but then, thanks to his popularity in opinion polls, he was able to threw behind himself the whole centre-right coalition, including the LV, Forza Italia, National Alliance, the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats and minor parties. In May 2007 he was elected mayor of Verona by a large margin: 60.8% to 33.9% of the incumbent Paolo Zanotto. Verona was thus the second largest Italian city ever ruled by Lega Nord (LN), the first one being Milan, ruled by Marco Formentini from 1993 to 1997. Tosi was one of the most popular mayors in Italy with approval ratings around 65-75%. In July 2008 the LV held its national congress in Padua. Tosi unsuccessfully tried to replace Gian Paolo Gobbo as national secretary, but was elected national president instead. Tosi appeared to be also the standard-bearer of the party in view of the 2010 regional election, along with Zaia. However, in December 2009 Tosi had to renounce his bid to become President of Veneto in favour of Zaia, who commanded a larger support in the party's national council. In June 2012 Tosi, just re-elected mayor of Verona with 57.4% of the vote (three times his closest opponent Michele Bertucco, who got a mere 22.8%), was elected national secretary of the LV with 57% of the votes (236 delegates out of 414), while his challenger Massimo Bitonci had 43% (178 delegates). Tosi was the chairman of the board of directors of Autostrada Brescia Verona Vicenza Padova, a toll road operator, as well as a member of the board of its parent company A4 Holding. In the 2014 European Parliament election Tosi was elected MEP with around 100,000 personal votes, only to step down a few months later. In March 2015, after a long struggle with Zaia, backed by LN's federal secretary Matteo Salvini, was ejected from the party. Subsequently, in the 2015 regional election, he ran for President of Veneto, supported by the Tosi List for Veneto, coming fourth with 11.9% of the vote. On 21 July 2015 Tosi founded his new party, called Act! (Fare!). Legal troubles On 2 December 2004 Tosi was found guilty of instigation to racism according to the Mancino law, for having collected signatures against the establishment of new gypsy camps in Verona. Later, on 30 January 2007, the Court of Appeal found Tosi not guilty for the above offence, while at the same time finding him guilty of a minor offence (promoting a hatred campaign). On 13 December 2007 the Court of Cassation cancelled the latter sentence and ruled that the a new appeal must take place. On June 2008 the Court of Cassation publicized the motivations of its December 2007 sentence, stating that Tosi was not guilty of promoting ideas of racial superiority or hatred and that it is acceptable to discriminate against Roma on the grounds that they are thieves, indicating that the Court of Appeals should not consider as crime political initiatives aimed at illegal acts of minority members.Italy: Court inflames Roma discrimination row The Guardian Retrieved 17 July 2008 On 20 October 2008 the Appeals' Court of Venice upheld the conviction of Tosi to two months of imprisonment with suspended sentence.

Wine is, together with beer and grape rakia, among the most popular alcoholic beverages in the country.

Wine production is growing again, reaching 108m litres in 2011, an increase of 4.9% from the previous year. Viticultural regions A government decree of 13 July 1960 officially divided Bulgaria into five distinct viticultural regions. Danubian Plain (North Bulgarian) Wine Museum in Pleven The Danubian Plain or North Bulgarian region encompasses the south banks of the Danube and the central and western parts of the Danubian Plain. The climate of the area is temperate continental, has a hot summer and many sunny days a year. Typical styles are Muscat Ottonel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay, Aligot√©, Pamid and the local Gamza. In the US appellation also approved as \\"Danube River Plains\\" region. Black Sea (East Bulgarian) The Black Sea region is where 30% of all vines are located. The region is characterized by long and mild autumns that are a favourable condition for the accumulation of sugars to make fine white wine (53% of all white wine varietals are concentrated in the region).

The island lies between the Idsefjorden and H√∏gsfjorden, about west of the town of J√∏rpeland. The island of Idsal lies immediately to the south and the island of Heng lies a short distance to the north of Idse. There is a bridge connecting Idse to neighboring Idsal, which in turn is connected to the mainland. Description There are about 40 farms on the south and east sides of the island, but in recent years there has been a significant decline with only three active dairy farmers remaining. The other farms grow potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries, blueberries, and Christmas trees. The north and west sides of the island are more hilly and forested and that area is populated with many holiday cabins. At Tangane and Kjeksev√•g, there are cabins that date back to the 1940s. There were families from the London area who fled the city during World War II and built cottages on Idse. In recent years, the cottage development has been very expansive, which probably has to do with good location near the cities of Stavanger and Sandnes. There are currently between 300 and 400 condos on the island. Historically, there was a grocery store and post office on the pier at Idse, but both are now closed. In 1917, a telephone line was built between J√∏rpeland and Idse. Notable residents Tore Thorsen Ids√∏e, founder of the renowned butcher shop A. Ids√∏e Holding, was born in 1796 in Idse.

He was secretary of the Council of Ministers in the Conte I Cabinet.  Political career  In the early 1990s, he joined Lega Lombarda and Lega Nord. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 1996 Italian general election, he was re-elected in 2001, 2006, 2008, 2013 and 2018. From 2001 to 2006, he was the chairman of the Budget Committee in the Chamber. Within the party, he was national secretary of Lega Lombarda from 2002 to 2012 and has been deputy federal secretary of Lega Nord since 2016. Giorgetti was described by The New York Times as a powerful aide to Umberto Bossi, founder and federal secretary of Lega Nord from 1991 to 2012; and by The Economist as his \\"dauphin\\". In 2010, The Guardian described him as an \\"influential member of Berlusconi's Lega Nord party\\", where Berlusconi stood erroneously for Bossi. Under Matteo Salvini, Bossi's opponent and new federal secretary of Lega Nord since 2013, Giorgetti continued to be one of the most influential members of the party.  Political views and controversies  Giorgetti is a federalist and regionalist politician who supports decentralization. Speaking at the 2018 edition of the Communion and Liberation Rimini Meeting on 20 August 2018, he addressed the rise of populism, stating that \\"the Italian Parliament doesn't matter anymore because it's no longer understood by citizens, who see it as a place of political inconclusiveness\\". Giorgetti is a vocal supporter of a first-past-the-post based electoral system and pushes for a return to the Italian electoral law of 1993 (Mattarellum), although it was repealed in favor of the Italian electoral law of 2005 (Porcellum, subsequently declared unconstitutional) with Lega Nord's support. In 2020 Giorgetti argued that Italy needs an electoral system that \\"makes possible to govern. Of all the electoral systems I've known, the one that worked best is Mattarellum\\", claiming that \\"local mayors, entrepreneurs, professionals and people representing their own territory were brought into nationwide politics thanks to FPTP's single-member districts mechanism\\". In 2006 Giorgetti found himself at the center of a controversy for having refused, in 2004, a 50‚Äì100,000 euro bribe from Italian banker Gianpiero Fiorani.

He joined Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord in the early 1990s and was elected to the Regional Council of Veneto at the 1995 regional election. He made his name in Venetist circles for being the author of resolution 42/1998 (title: \\"Yesterday's and today's peoples and the right to self-determination\\"), concerning the \\"self-determination\\" of the Venetian people. The resolution read: \\"The Venetian people [‚Ä¶] invokes its right to a democratic and direct referendum for the free expression of its right to self-determination\\". The resolution was approved by a majority vote in the Council on 22 April 1998. His strong Venetism eventually led Morosin to leave Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord in October 1998 to join Liga Veneta Repubblica (LVR), along with Fabrizio Comencini and other four regional councillors. In 2000 he missed re-election and was an unsuccessful candidate in many other elections. In 2004, when LVR secretary Ettore Beggiato and a majority of party members switched to North- East Project (PNE), Morosin remained loyal to Comencini and was elected party president, a post he held until 2007. Disillusioned with traditional Venetism, he watched with great interest the birth of the Venetian National Party (PNV) in 2008 and finally joined Veneto State (VS) at its founding congress in September 2010. A year later, during a party congress in October 2011, he ran for party president of VS, but lost to Lucio Chiavegato. In May 2012 Morosin switched to Venetian Independence (IV) and was elected honorary president of the new party. Having become the leader of IV at the beginning of 2014, he recruited Chiavegato and Fabio Padovan into the party and ran for President of Veneto in the 2015 regional election. In the event, he and the party obtained 2.5% of the vote, but no seats in the Regional Council.

The militant group and Al-Qaeda offshoot, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. The gunmen took over 700 students hostage, freeing Muslims and killing those who identified as Christians. The siege ended the same day, when all four of the attackers were killed. Five men were later arrested in connection with the attack, and a bounty was placed for the arrest of a suspected organizer, Mohamed Mahmoud, also known as Dulyadeyn. Dulyadeyn was later killed by U.S.-trained Somali commandos from the Somali National Army on the night of May 31, 2016 in Bulo Gadud, a town loyal to Al- Shabaab, about 30 kilometers north of the port of Kismayo in Somalia.

It also hosts a yellow-eyed penguin colony, arguably the rarest of penguin species, with approximately 1600 breeding pairs in the extant population. The bay, along with neighbouring Porpoise Bay, is home to the endemic Hector's dolphin. Southern right whales are occasionally observed offshore, as on numerous parts of the country's coast. Located near the southernmost point of the South Island,R. Buckingham and J. Hall-Jones. 1985 Curio Bay is one of the major attractions in the Catlins, attracting around 100,000 visitors per year. The town of Waikawa has an information center for tourists. A petrified log at Curio Bay The now petrified logs, from ancient conifers closely related to modern kauri and Norfolk pine, were buried by ancient volcanic mud flows and gradually replaced by silica to produce the fossils now exposed by the sea. The fossilised forest grew at a time of semi- tropical climate and before grasses and flowering plants had come into existence. The original forest of cycads, conifers and ferns was buried by massive floods of ash and volcanic debris either directly from a volcanic eruption or from later heavy rain on a barren volcanic mountain. Distinct bands of fossilised vegetation exposed in the cliff face indicate that in between such floods, the forest grew back at least four times over a period of some 20,000 years. Following this, the area remained buried over millions of years. Silica started to impregnate the wood and eventually turned it into stone, preserving not just tree stumps and wood, but in some places also fern fronds and leaves. Known fossil forests of this age are very few throughout the world, and this is one of the most extensive and least disturbed of them. The overall area stretches for from Curio Bay to Slope Point.

It serves as both a provincial daily and as a local newspaper for Saint John. The newspaper is published by Brunswick News, owned by J.K. Irving. The Telegraph-Journal is the only New Brunswick-based newspaper to be distributed province-wide and has the highest readership in the province at a weekly circulation of 233,549 and a daily readership of about 100,000. Brunswick News also publishes a series of editions of regional news, including editions in Fredericton and Moncton under the titles Daily Gleaner and Times & Transcript, respectively. Corporate management is based in Saint John. History The paper has been published out of Saint John since 1862. Capitalist Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving, without formal announcement bought New Brunswick Publishing and the Telegraph-Journal, as well as a local Saint John radio station CHSJ in 1944. Eventually word got out that Irving had bought the paper as he began purchasing others in the province. Controversies The Telegraph-Journal has been the focus of controversy several times over recent years, with allegations of media control, bias and advocacy journalism on behalf of business and political interests. A report from the Canadian Senate in 2006 on media control in Canada singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies' ownership of all English-language daily newspapers in the province, including the Telegraph-Journal. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the Senate report, stated, \\"We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick.\\" The report went further, stating, \\"the Irvings' corporate interests form an industrial-media complex that dominates the province\\" to a degree \\"unique in developed countries.\\" At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses. Irving family scion Jamie Irving took over as publisher in 2005, after which criticism of the Telegraph-Journals journalism became even more prevalent. This was particularly notable during the newspaper's reporting of issues related to electricity rates and NB Power, the crown corporation responsible for power generation and distribution. Editorials argued against rate increases that would harm J.D. Irving Ltd but failed to acknowledge the conflict of interest. In 2009 the Telegraph-Journal weathered a storm of national attention after a series of incidents that raised issues regarding the newspaper's credibility. The Telegraph-Journal faced charges of political bias when it fired intern Matt McCann for writing a story about a protest against the award by the University of New Brunswick of an honorary degree to New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham. In response to the firing, respected professors from the University of New Brunswick, Mount Allison University and St. Thomas University announced a boycott of the newspaper. Further controversy arose over the Telegraph-Journals reporting of municipal affairs in Saint John. The newspaper ran a series of stories alleging mismanagement and inappropriate conduct by the City Manager and senior staff, based on what were later seen as fabrications, and faced allegations that it was using negative coverage to blackmail the City into making changes in administration and the tax rate. This led to a very public conflict between the Mayor and the newspaper. Shortly after, in the \\"Wafergate\\" affair, Telegraph-Journal editors altered a news story about the funeral of Lieutenant Governor Romeo LeBlanc to allege that the Prime Minister of Canada 'pocketed' a communion wafer while attending. The resulting controversy dominated national news coverage. Embarrassingly, the Telegraph-Journal was later forced to retract the allegation and apologize for fabricating the story after its own reporters threatened a lawsuit over editorial manipulation. The newspaper's credibility suffered further under critical national media attention. Editor Shawna Richer was dismissed and publisher Jamie Irving was suspended. A well-respected editor was brought in from outside the province to rehabilitate the publication, though Jamie Irving quietly returned to manage the Telegraph- Journal later in the year. Controversy continued in 2009 when a Telegraph- Journal writer plagiarized an entire story from the French-language paper, L‚ÄôAcadie Nouvelle. The incident triggered another apology from the Telegraph- Journal. In 2015 the Telegraph-Journal once again came under scrutiny over its efforts to obtain, as part of a campaign for greater transparency into government lobbying and partisanship, lists of guests at the Government of New Brunswick's \\"Larry‚Äôs Gulch\\" luxury fishing lodge. An employee of Brunswick News, the newspaper's parent organization, had been a guest at the lodge and contrived to have his own name deleted from the lists prior to publication. Brunswick News had become aware of this ethical breach but didn't act until another news outlet, Canadaland, was about to break the story. The employee was forced out, and despite its earlier fervour for transparency the Telegraph-Journal quietly dropped further efforts to publish Larry's Gulch guest lists. Court proceedings in 2019 suggested that greater Irving family control over the newspaper's editorial direction was a factor in how the organization handled this affair.

Edwin Head Office Their most popular line of clothing is the 503 jeans model which was first sold in 1997. Actor Brad Pitt has been an official spokesman and model for the brand, appearing in many of its advertisements in the past. History Established in Tokyo, Japan, in 1947, the EDWIN brand is known for its authenticity, innovation and craftsmanship. Founder Tsunemi Yonehachi was amongst the first merchants to bring vintage American jeans to Japan in the postwar era, setting off a national obsession with denim. In 1961, inspired by a growing demand, EDWIN (whose company name comes from a creative rearrangement of the letters found in the word \\"denim\\") debuted the first made-in-Japan jeans. By the 1970s, EDWIN had established itself as a pioneer in denim manufacturing, experimenting with wash techniques in the EDWIN Wash House that impacted denim wash processes around the globe. Innovations included ONE WASH, a prewash process to eliminate shrinkage prior to purchase, and OLD WASH, a precursor to stone wash that reproduces faded colors through careful abrasion techniques for a lived-in denim look. Today, EDWIN continues to set the gold standard in Japanese denim production, priding itself on the use of exclusive fabrics, revolutionary production technologies, state-of-the-art finishing and advancements in design and fit.

Notable examples of his design work include the ZX81 case and touch- sensitive keyboard and the ZX Spectrum rubber keyboard. Early life Dickinson graduated from Newcastle Polytechnic in 1979 with a First Class Bachelor of Arts honours degree in Design for Industry. The \\"Design for Industry\\" degree was the first of its kind, formerly a three-year \\"Industrial Design\\" degree. The new course, with two additional terms for industrial placements, extended the degree to four years and popularised the term \\"sandwich course\\". Sinclair Dickinson joined Sir Clive Sinclair's Sinclair Research Ltd in December 1979, replacing John Pemberton who was leaving Sinclair to head up a new design centre for ITT in Harlow. Sinclair Research offices were at 6 Kings Parade, Cambridge. Dickinson was the in-house industrial designer of Sinclair Research Ltd. He saw John Pemberton's design for the ZX80 case through to completion and designed a memory expansion. He went on to design the ZX81, including its touch-sensitive keyboard, a \\"clear step forward\\" in home computer design. In the rubber keyboard for the ZX Spectrum, he replaced the hundreds of components of a conventional keyboard with a design using \\"maybe four or five moving parts\\". Along with its colour display, engineered by Richard Altwasser, and commercialisation by Sir Clive Sinclair, the Spectrum popularised home computing, coding and gaming. Dickinson also designed the TV80 casing and Sinclair QL. The ZX81 won a British Design Council award in 1981. It won a Haus Industrieform award and is in a permanent collection in Essen. The Sinclair QL won an Italian design award at the Smau Industrial Design Award. Post-Sinclair In 1986, he founded Dickinson Associates, an industrial design consultancy based in Cambridge. That year he produced the industrial design for an early laptop computer, the Cambridge Z88. In 1987 he was commissioned by Alan Sugar to create the industrial design concept for Amstrad's first portable computer. In 1989, Dickinson, Christopher Curry (Acorn Computers), and Keith Dunning re- thought the MacArthur field microscope and Dickinson designed the Lensman microscope, a portable field microscope. In 1990‚Äì91 the Lensman microscope won the BBC design awards, The Prince Of Wales Award For Industrial Innovation And Production, and the Archimedes award for Engineering Excellence. Dickinson met Apple founder Steve Jobs numerous times as they shared ideas for the MacBook in 1994. He produced the industrial design concepts and models of the first \\"Broad Band phone\\" for AT&T.; Dickinson Associates created the industrial design, mechanical design, and production engineering design for the first GSM mobile phone \\"reference phone\\" design, for Rockwell. Dickinson Associates were also the designers of the Gizmondo handheld console (originally the Gametrac). In 2014, he published concept designs for modern Sinclair microcomputers. The following year, Dickinson published a series of images of the ZX Spectrum Next re-imagining the original Spectrum design. In 2016, he designed a wireless patch for a medical system to allow expectant mothers to monitor fetal heart rates. He also worked on the design of the ZX Spectrum Vega+ handheld games console. The first ZX Spectrum Next was delivered in February 2020. Personal life and death Dickinson had two daughters, Grace and Daisy, with his first wife Kim. He is survived by them and by his second wife Elizabeth (\\"Lizzy\\"). Dickinson died on 24 April 2018 while in Texas receiving further treatment for cancer first diagnosed in 2015.

An immensely powerful speedster that leads a cult dedicated to the Speed Force, he has battled Wally West, Jay Garrick, and Barry Allen. The character appeared on The CW's live-action television series The Flash during the third season, voiced by Tobin Bell and portrayed by Grant Gustin. Publication history Savitar first appeared in Flash (vol. 2) #108 (December 1995), and was created by Mark Waid and Oscar Jimenez. Fictional character biography Savitar was originally an unnamed pilot for a third-world nation that was to test a supersonic fighter jet during the Cold War. As he reached top speed, his plane was struck by what appeared to be lightning and he went down in hostile territory. Discovering he could defeat the enemy by moving at super-speed, he became obsessed, naming himself after the Hindu \\"god of motion\\" Savitar and dedicating his life to unlocking its secrets. As he studied, Savitar discovered new powers that no other living speedster has mastered. He can protect himself in a null-inertia force field, give speed and kinetic energy to objects or people, even those in a \\"rest state\\", and he could also heal his own injuries almost instantly. Savitar's obsession gained followers, and he became the leader of a cult. In search of more knowledge, he sought out the only super-speed hero operating at the time: Johnny Quick. This encounter became a battle, the tide of which was turned with Max Mercury's arrival leading Savitar toward the Speed Force, but causing him to bounce off, both speedsters being thrown forward in time.Flash vol. 2 #109 (Jan. 1996) Emerging from the timestream before Savitar, Max Mercury became a mentor to the Flash family's various members and other speedsters, secretly preparing them against the day Savitar would exit the timestream. Reappearing decades later, Savitar found that his cult had grown in his absence, awaiting his return. He recruited former Blue Trinity member Lady Flash (Christina Alexandrova), and discovered a way to use the woman's speed to divert all energy from the Speed Force to his own army of ninjas. He then sought to eliminate the competition: The Flash (Wally West), Impulse, Golden Age Flash (Jay Garrick), Johnny Quick, Jesse Quick, XS and Max Mercury. Wally's direct Speed Force connection prevented Savitar from stealing Wally's speed, and a coalition of just about every speedster (except for Red Trinity) foiled his plans. Hell-bent on at least destroying the Flash's world in retribution, Savitar led Wally on a worldwide race of destruction, until the Flash chose to give Savitar what he wanted: union with the Speed Force. His earlier encounter had shown him that the others who had arrived before would deal with Savitar as they saw fit. In The Flash Rebirth mini-series, Savitar was able to escape from the Speed Force. He was run down by the Flash (Barry Allen) but Savitar disintegrates when the Flash touches him, leaving only a pile of bones.The Flash: Rebirth #1 (April 2009) It is revealed that Professor Zoom altered Barry's Speed Force connection to make the Flash shift in reverse, cursed to kill every Speed Force user with a single touch until a conflict between the Flash and Zoom.The Flash: Rebirth #4 (August 2009) Savitar, Lady Savitar (Christina Alexandrova) and Johnny Quick have been killed by this effect.The Flash: Rebirth #2 (May 2009)The Flash: Rebirth #3 (June 2009) In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity where parts of Savitar's origin are used in the Top's origin. In DC Rebirth, Troia (a version of Donna Troy from an alternate future) recalls that Wally was killed by either Savitar or Brother Blood from that time.Titans #17 Powers and abilities Savitar can move at super-speed, and is able to lend or steal speed from moving objects. He has accelerated healing due to increased metabolism and can generate a full Inertia force field. In other media Television A heavily adapted iteration of Savitar appears in The CW's live-action television series The Flash as the main antagonist of the third season, voiced by Tobin Bell and portrayed by Grant Gustin. Stuntman Andre Tricoteux portrayed Savitar's powered armor, Tom Felton portrayed Savitar's Doctor Alchemy avatar, and both Nicholas Gonzalez and Vanessa A. Williams portrayed impersonations of Dante Ramon and Francine West respectively. In the third season, Savitar is a future time remnant of Barry Allen, who in the future shunned him because he wasn't the real Barry Allen, who had been trapped in the Speed Force. In the present, after Barry had erased the \\"Flashpoint\\" timeline, Savitar uses Central City CSI Julian Albert to become his servant \\"Alchemy\\" and restore the meta-human powers of those including Edward Clarris\\\\The Rival from Flashpoint by using an ancient Hindu artifact called \\"the Brahmastra\\" aka Philosopher's Stone until he was defeated by Team Flash. Team Flash uses Julian to contact Savitar using the stone, who reveals knowledge and secrets of the team, and the team discovers that Savitar has been trapped in the Speed Force and that the stone is made of calcified Speed Force energy. Savitar lures Wally West into trapping him in the Speed Force so that he becomes free. Barry then rescues Wally with the help of Jay Garrick, who voluntarily takes Wally's place as prisoner. After realising Savitar is himself, Barry goes to confront him. Savitar reveals his origins and that he used history to turn himself into a myth, such as \\"the first man ever granted speed\\". Savitar plans to kill Iris West-Allen to make Barry suffer the same way he did, but Team Flash prevents that from happening when H.R. Wells sacrifices himself by disguising himself as Iris using his facial transmogrifier from Earth 19. Due to this, Savitar kidnaps Cisco Ramon to create an inter-dimensional quantum splicer that will allow him to disperse himself throughout time and protect him from the paradox that threatens him. Barry then confronts Savitar again, who uses the splicer that was actually modified into a skeleton key to free Jay. Eventually, Iris fatally shoots Savitar, finally erasing him from the timeline. In the fifth season, Savitar is shown when Barry and his future daughter Nora West-Allen travel back to the final fight to grab a piece of Savitar's armor.

Ramos was born in Zit√°cuaro, Michoac√°n, and in 1909 entered the Colegio de San Nicol√°s in Hidalgo. He published his first works in the school's student publication Flor de Loto. In 1915 he began to study philosophy under the tutelage of his mentor, Jos√© Torres Orozco. He spent 1915, his first year of medical school in Morelia, and his second and third years at the Military Medical School in Mexico City. In 1919 he became part of the faculty of higher learning and taught introductory philosophy at the National Preparatory School and logic and ethics at the National Teachers School. He pursued specialized degrees at the Sorbonne, the Coll√®ge de France, and a University in Rome. Upon his return to Mexico, he continued to teach and served in the Ministry of Public Education. In 1944 he earned his doctorate in philosophy from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and became head of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature there. On July 8, 1952 he began a lifelong term as a member of the prestigious Colegio Nacional. Philosophy His work concerns itself with the ontology of the Mexican nation. He sees the pelado, the \\"urban bum\\" of the 1920s and 1930s, as \\"the most elemental and clearly defined expression of national character\\". The machismo of the pelado, he argues, is the result of an inferiority complex (based on Alfred Adler's concept) and, since the pelado represents the entire country, the \\"character study\\" is extended to all of Mexico, and was one of the first post-Revolutionary attempts to define and assess the national character.

It presents a series of disconnected vignettes that together interrogate aspects of modern life. The film uses many quotations from the work of the Peruvian poet C√©sar Vallejo as a recurring motif. It is the first film in a trilogy, followed by You, the Living (2007) and A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence (2014). Plot A man is standing in a subway car, his face dirty with soot. In his right hand he carries a plastic bag with documents, or rather, the charred leftovers of them. In a corridor a man is clinging desperately to the legs of the boss who just fired him. He is screaming: \\"I've been here for thirty years!\\" In a coffee shop someone is waiting for his father, who just burned his furniture company for insurance money. Traffic jams and self-flagellating stock brokers are filling up the streets while an economist, desperate for a solution to the problem of work becoming too expensive, gazes into the crystal ball of a scryer.

National Gallery of Scotland. The Lorimer family grave, Newburn, Fife John Henry Lorimer (12 August 1856 ‚Äì 4 November 1936) was a Scottish painter who worked on portraits and genre scenes of everyday life. Life Lorimer was born in Edinburgh, the son of James Lorimer, who was Regius Professor of Public Law at Edinburgh University from 1862 to 1890. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, Edinburgh University and in 1875 at the Royal Scottish Academy, taught by William McTaggart and George Paul Chalmers. This was followed by a period spent in Paris studying with Carolus-Duran. His younger brother was the renowned architect Sir Robert Lorimer, who he sketched and painted throughout his life along with his sisters. Lorimer's first portrait was of his mother Hannah, completed in 1875 when he was 19 years old. Lorimer travelled throughout Spain, Italy and Algiers between 1877 and 1891. He exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy from 1873 and at the Royal Academy from 1878. Significant amongst his works are The Ordination of Elders in a Scottish Kirk, which hangs in the National Gallery of Scotland, Spring Moonlight, which hangs in Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery and was the favourite painting of the readers of the local newspaper The Fife Free Press, and Kellie Castle Garden, which was sold at auction in 2000 for ¬£32,900. His portraits include Lyon Playfair, Joseph Lister, Peter Hately Waddell, Frederick Guthrie Tait and other luminaries of the era. Lorimer was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1882 and made a full academician in 1900. He showed 123 works at the Royal Scottish Academy and 43 works at the Royal Academy in London. In 1878 the Lorimer family acquired the lease of Kellie Castle in Fife and began its restoration for use as a holiday home. Many of Lorimer's paintings included Kellie Castle as a subject or as a setting; his studio was in one of the towers and looked out over the garden. Kellie Castle became the permanent family home, after purchase in 1948 by Robert Lorimer's son, the sculptor Hew Lorimer. The castle is owned today by the National Trust for Scotland who maintain a changing exhibition of his works, plus those of his brother, Robert Lorimer and nephew, Hew Lorimer. 1 Bruntsfield Crescent, Edinburgh In later life he lived at 1 Bruntsfield Crescent in Edinburgh in a large house remodelled by his brother Robert Lorimer who also lived there together with their sister Louise Lorimer. The artist Robert Gibb lived next door at 2 Bruntsfield Crescent at that time.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1894-95 He was a Vice-President of the Edinburgh Astronomical Association (now known as the Astronomical Society of Edinburgh) and left a bequest to them on his death.

In 2007, the new province of El Tamarugal was established and the comuna of Huara, previously within the province of Iquique, was incorporated to the newly created province. Early history Mouth of Quebrada Tiliviche and (bottom) the ruins of Pisagua Viejo According to Francisco Riso Patr√≥n, and stated in Diccionario Geogr√°fico de las Provincias de Tacna y Tarapac√°, the name Pisagua has a quechua origin, meaning \\"place of scarce water\\": Pis - scarce, agua - water. Pisagua was founded in 1611 after an edict by the Viceroy of Peru which established a base from which it could be possible to stem the illegal traffic of gold and silver flowing from the important mines of Potos√≠ and Oruro, in the Highlands of the \\"Audiencia of Charcas\\", to the British and Dutch pirates operating in the Corregimiento de Arica. Thus, Pisagua became a minor port, subjected to the major Port of San Marcos de Arica. This settlement, known today as 'Pisagua Viejo' (Old Pisagua) developed at the south side of the Quebrada Tiliviche, on part of an extensive ancient midden deposit. Some adobe ruins remain. The \\"Nitrate boom\\" It was not until 1810 when large nitrate (\\"salitre\\" or saltpeter) deposits were discovered in the Corregimiento de Tarapac√° that Pisagua became an important port due to its major role in the export of this product. Tsunami forced the transfer of Pisagua to the place where it lies today, in 1836. This site is a small plain located between the peninsulas of Punta Pichalo and Punta Pisagua, about 3 km South of Pisagua Viejo. The War of the Pacific On November 2, 1879 Pisagua was occupied by Chilean troops during the Guerra del Pac√≠fico, in the \\"Battle of Pisagua\\". After the war, Pisagua went from Peruvian hands to Chilean administration. The heydays of the town Pisagua became an important port of the South Pacific during the nitrate boom of the 1870s. During the first years of the 20th century, Pisagua had become one of the most important ports of the whole country (after Valpara√≠so and Iquique), with offices from major banks, and one of the most beautiful cities on the Southern Pacific coast. Pisagua railway station in 2006 Railway history The construction of a standard gauge railway line to connect Pisagua with the interior started in about 1865, while Pisagua was still a Peruvian possession. Work continued under Chilean administration, and by 1935 Pisagua was the northern terminus of a network of main and branch lines, with a connection to Iquique, the principal terminus of the line. Trains climbed from sea level at Pisagua to the interior plateau via three reversing zig-zags and a heavily graded line. Supplies for the interior towns and nitrate works were hauled up from the coast, and nitrate for export made up the return load. The principal traffic was always nitrate, after which came fuel, passengers, perishables, parcels, general merchandise, and livestock. Water for the steam locomotives and the town relied on two wells at Dolores (see map), from Pisagua, which today still derives its water from this source.http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r088.html Decline When the nitrate boom came to an end, the port of Pisagua could keep some degree of importance because of its new role in the fishmeal industry. However, at the end of the 1950s, Pisagua lost most of its population and economic base and went into precipitous decline and even ceased to be the third town in importance of Tarapac√° province (after Arica and Iquique). Pisagua as a prisoner site Pisagua has often been used as a concentration camp for political prisoners. This happened during the rule of Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo (for male homosexuals), as well as that of Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla (for communists, anarchists and revolutionaries) and more recently, during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship (for left-wing militants). Many bodies have been found under the waters of the port and several graves have been discovered in Pisagua since the end of Pinochet's military regime. Pisagua is geographically isolated, with the ocean on one side and a big desert on the other. Pisagua today Pisagua today. At one time several thousand people lived here, and a railway brought nitrate from the interior to be loaded on ships from all over the world. Today a modest open-boat fishing fleet and occasional tourists provide a living for the town. The earthworks, embankments and cuttings that carried the railway into the town are clearly visible on the bare ground. The old railway station still stands in Pisagua itself, where there are other interesting (although semi-derelict) buildings made with Oregon pine wood. Good examples are the turret of the clock, the municipal theatre, and the hospital, all dating from the nitrate period. Today, Pisagua is no longer the proud and rich port that once was but a small and isolated village with a population of just 260, included in the municipality of Huara, which has only 2,600 inhabitants itself.

There have also been other protests in the United States by US Stuckists, and there have been Stuckist events against the Iraq War in 2003. They have received extensive media coverage for these events both in the UK and internationally, and become possible suspects for any London art protests, as in Matthew Collings' description of the opening of Tate Modern in 2000: \\"Guilt-free art lovers crossed picket lines put up by envious artist-outsiders.

It stars Arvind Swami and Madhoo in the lead roles, with the latter essaying the title role. It follows Roja, a simple girl from a village in Tamil Nadu, making desperate efforts to find her husband, Rishikumar, after he is kidnapped by militants during a secret undercover mission in Jammu and Kashmir. The theme of the film is based on the relationship between Savitri and Satyavan of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. It was released along with Suriyan starring Sarath Kumar and Roja. Both movies had a very good theatrical run and were accepted by audiences widely. The film was produced by K. Balachander under his Kavithalayaa Productions and distributed by G. Venkateswaran. The film's cinematography was handled by Santhosh Sivan and editing done by Suresh Urs. The film released on 15 August 1992, to positive reviews, receiving praise for its patriotic theme. The film was dubbed and released in Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam and Telugu languages. The film won three National Film Awards, including Best Film on National Integration, catapulting Ratnam to national acclaim. The film also gained international acclaim with its nomination for Best Film at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. The film was re-released for international audiences in light of the growing fear of terrorist attacks across the world. It is the first in Ratnam's trilogy of films, with the others being Bombay (1995) and Dil Se.. (1998), that depict human relationships against a background of Indian politics. A. R. Rahman debuted as a film composer with this film. He won the National Film Award for Best Music Direction, Filmfare Award for Best Music Director ‚Äì Tamil and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Music Director for his work.  Plot  In Srinagar, a Kashmiri terrorist, Wasim Khan, is captured by a team led by Colonel Rayappa. In Southern India, 18-year old Roja is a simple village girl born and brought up in Sundarapandiapuram in Tenkasi district (then in Tirunelveli district in southern Tamil Nadu. Roja fervently wishes that her sister Shenbagam's marriage proposal with Rishikumar, a cryptologist working with the R.A.W. of India, goes smoothly. Unknown to her and her family, Shenbagam is in love with the son of her paternal aunt. When Rishi wishes to speak to Shenbagam alone, she gathers enough courage to convey this and politely asks him to reject her in front of her parents, to which he obliges. To everyone's surprise, Rishi requests Roja's hand in marriage instead. Being unaware of Shenbagam's love affair, Roja is not willing to accept Rishi's proposal as she believes that he is the best match for Shenbagam but she marries Rishi, and the couple go to live in Madras while Shenbagam marries her cousin. Initially, Roja does not like what Rishi did, but when she learns of Shenbagam's love story and consequent rejection of Rishi, she apologizes and starts seeing him in a new light. Love blossoms and life is blissful for the couple for a short while. Meanwhile, due to the illness of his Chief, Rishi is assigned to an army communications center in Baramulla to intercept military intelligence. The couple finds themselves in a beautiful yet alien land. Roja's world turns upside down when Rishi is abducted by terrorists whose agenda is to separate Kashmir from India and free their leader, Wasim Khan, from judicial custody. Faced with the daunting task of rescuing her husband, Roja runs from pillar to post, pleading with politicians and the military for help. Further complicating matters is the communication gap: She can't speak their language, and they can't speak hers. Meanwhile, Rishi, held captive by a group of terrorists led by Liaqat, an associate to Wasim Khan, tries to reason with the terrorists, about their misdirected motive for the liberation of Kashmir. Liaqat's sister shows a little compassion towards him. Initially, when Roja's efforts fail, the Indian government denies any negotiations with the terrorists for the release of Rishi in the media. The angered terrorists attempt to burn an Indian flag. Rishi risks his life to put out the fire and shows the terrorist how much the country means to him, a regular citizen. When Liaqat's younger brother, who with a few other youths from his village was sent across the border to Pakistan for training, is shot by the Pakistan Army, Liaqat's strong belief is shaken, but he still manages to convince himself of the cause. Consequently, Roja's efforts to apprise the politicians of her suffering and pain are successful as a minister pities her and offers to help. Much to the chagrin of Rayappa, the government decides to release Wasim Khan in exchange for Rishi. Rishi, not wanting to be used as a pawn to release a dangerous terrorist, gets help from the sympathetic Liaqat's sister and escapes ‚Äî with Liaqat and his men chasing him. Rayappa, Roja, and other army officers get to the hostage exchange spot with Wasim Khan, but Liaqat does not show up. The Army locks Wasim Khan up in the prison. Rishi has managed to get close to the exchange spot on his own after evading the terrorists. During his escape, Rishi subdues two terrorists. Liaqat catches up with him and holds him at gunpoint. Rishi reasons with Liaqat further and convinces him that his war is immoral. Liaqat lets Rishi go and he goes to the exchange spot. Liaqat escapes from the Indian Army while Rishi and Roja are united once again.

Doraiswamy, an executive of the Indian Oil Corporation, was kidnapped by Kashmiri militants and put in captivity for two months. This inspired Mani Ratnam to make the film Roja. Doraiswamy's wife was fighting for his release, and according to Ratnam, it was her plight that the film was based on. During the making of Anjali (1990), Ratnam told actor and director Kitty the outline of Roja and offered him to direct the film. Kitty declined, as he wanted to do something of his own. As Ratnam was telling him the outline, the subject became more crystallised. Kitty did not pick it up and when filmmaker K. Balachander asked Ratnam, he told him the outline. All the developments happened after that. It was Balachander who approached Ratnam to make a film for his banner. As Balachander was the inspiration and the reason for Ratnam entering Tamil films, when he asked him to make a film for his banner, Ratnam wanted it to be one of the best films they had produced. Ratnam was keen that it needed to be of Balachander's standard. Balachander instantly approved the outline of the film when Ratnam narrated. However, he disliked the title Roja () as he felt it sounded similar to the name of a brand of crushed betel nut. Ratnam thought the title represented Kashmir because \\"the rose is something beautiful but with thorns\\". To satisfy Balachander, he suggested another title Irudhi Varai (), but Balachander preferred Roja, which was finalised. Roja was the first film for which Ratnam used a Steadicam, in the shot that introduces the terrorists' hideout to the audiences. The film was made on a shoestring budget. The technicians worked for less money with the understanding that the film would also be sold for less money. It was not thought of as something that would work on a big scale. The film was composed mostly of newcomers, a new music director, and it was about Kashmir which, according to Ratnam, not much was known to Tamil people at that time. He called the film \\"a bit of an experiment\\". It is also the first in Ratnam's trilogy of films that depict human relationships against a background of Indian politics, including Bombay (1995) and Dil Se.. (1998). Roja is a contemporary adaptation of the story of Savitri and Satyavan. According to Ratnam, it was not originally planned as a political film: \\"It was a phase India was going through and these things affected me and found their way into my work.\\"  Casting  Arvind Swamy, who made his acting debut in Ratnam's Thalapathi (1991), was signed on to play the lead role in Roja after the role was declined by cinematographer Rajiv Menon. Actress Aishwarya was initially offered the female lead, but declined it due to date issues. The role went to Madhoo. Aishwarya later revealed that she deeply regretted that decision, which was made by her grandmother against her will, for a Telugu film which was later cancelled. Ratnam approached Karisma Kapoor to play a Kashmiri girl, but he considered her \\"far too expensive for a Tamil film\\". Vaishnavi was cast as Roja's sister Shenbagam, and Raju Sundaram appeared in the song \\"Rukmini\\".  Filming  Ratnam had planned to shoot Roja in Kashmir, but extreme terrorism there forced him to shoot the film in other hill stations resembling it. Shooting locations included Coonoor, Ooty, and Manali, Himachal Pradesh. The film's cinematographer Santosh Sivan said that a lot of images were written in at the script level. Even in the Kashmir sequences, the audience only sees the snow when Roja sees it for the first time. These things were written into the script. The song \\"Chinna Chinna Aasai\\" was shot at Hogenakkal Falls in Dharmapuri and in the Banatheertham falls in Courtallam. Shakti Singh dubbed for Arvind Swamy in the Hindi version of the film, while Madhoo dubbed for herself. The whole film was completed in less than 60 days. The final length of the film was .  Themes and influences  Writing for the magazine Jump Cut, Kumudan Maderya noted that Roja celebrates \\"the middle-class yuppie hero‚Äôs nationalistic fervor\\" and positions the \\"anti-national communalist terrorists in Kashmir\\" as key threats to India as a whole. Vairamuthu, who was signed as the lyricist, felt the film's \\"tense and action-packed\\" content was in sharp contrast to the \\"poetic\\" title. Journalist Malini Mannath and a writer for Bangalore Mirror compared Roja to Held Hostage (1991), a television film about the kidnapping of journalist Jerry Levin whose rescue was organised by his wife. Soundtrack The soundtrack and background score for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman, in his debut as a music director. Mani Ratnam, who previously worked with Ilayaraaja in his earlier films, replaced him with Rahman, who worked as a keyboard programmer for Ilayaraaja for his film Moodu Pani (1980), also marking their first collaboration as well. The album features seven tracks in Tamil and Hindi, and six tracks in Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi and five tracks in the instrumental adaptation album. The song \\"Thamizha Thamizha\\" is a poem written by Subramanya Bharathi. \\"Chinna Chinna Aasai\\" was the first song Rahman had composed for the film. The song \\"Kadhal Rojave\\" has two versions in both Tamil and Hindi; a solo and a duet in the former. The Hindi version of the song was titled \\"Roja Jaaneman\\" has two versions - one by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and the other by Hariharan. The album received critical acclaim and was also listed in Time magazine's \\"10 Best Soundtracks\\" of all time. The Tamil and Hindi versions of the album sold over million units in India, with the Tamil version selling over 200,000 units and the Hindi version selling 2.8million units.  Release  Roja was released on 15 August 1992. In August 2015, it was screened at the 2015 London Indian Film Festival, in the retrospective series Politics as Spectacle: The Films of Mani Ratnam, along with Bombay and Dil Se.  Reception   Critical response  Roja received positive reception for its patriotic themes. On 26 September 1992, K. Vijayan of New Straits Times wrote, \\"Under [Mani Ratnam]'s direction, [Arvind] and [Madhoo] gave their best ... The excellent photography by Santhosh Sivan [who was also the cameraman for Thalapathi] makes us appreciate the beauty we take for granted in the villages. The snow-capped mountains and flower-covered valleys of Kashmir are also an eyeful.\\" Writing for The Indian Express, Malini Mannath compared Roja unfavourably to Held Hostage; she praised Arvind Swamy's performance, calling him \\"dignified and natural\\", but criticised Madhoo's performance in the scenes where Roja pleads for her husband's rescue, saying, \\"Her tremulous whisper praying for help, sounds contrived\\". She also felt that Pankaj Kapoor looked \\"lost in his role\\", but lauded the cinematography by Santosh Sivan and the editing by Suresh Urs. T. N. Seshan, then the Chief Election Commissioner of India declared, \\"This is a film that every Indian should see.\\" The soundtrack by A. R. Rahman was included in the \\"10 Best Soundtracks\\" of all time listed by Time magazine, issued in 2005.  Box office  Roja emerged a commercial success in the Indian market.

Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, L√º Dai started his career as a minor official in his home commandery in present-day Taizhou, Jiangsu before migrating south to the Jiangdong (or Wu) region, where he became an assistant magistrate and later a county chief under the warlord Sun Quan. He rose to prominence after his successes in suppressing some rebellions in Sun Quan's territories. Around the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period, Sun Quan, who later became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu, appointed L√º Dai as the governor of the restive Jiao Province in the south. During his ten-year-long tenure in Jiao Province, L√º Dai quelled a number of revolts, maintained peace in the area, and contacted some foreign kingdoms in Mainland Southeast Asia and made them pay tribute to Eastern Wu. In 231, he was recalled to Wuchang to oversee civil and military affairs in Jing Province (present-day Hubei and Hunan) alongside his colleague Lu Xun. Throughout the 230s, he suppressed a few rebellions in Wu territories. By 240, as he neared the age of 80, he was still in good physical health and competent enough to perform his duties. He rose to the position of Senior General-in-Chief in 246 and later Grand Marshal in 252 during the reign of Sun Quan's successor Sun Liang. He died at the old age of 95 and was one of the longest-living notable persons of the Three Kingdoms period. Early career L√º Dai was from Hailing County (), Guangling Commandery (), which is in present-day Taizhou, Jiangsu. He started his career in the late Eastern Han dynasty as a low-level bureaucrat in the county and commandery offices. When chaos broke out throughout China in the 180s and 190s, he fled south to the Jiangdong (or Wu) region for shelter.(ÂëÇÂ≤±Â≠óÂÆöÂÖ¨ÔºåÂª£ÈôµÊµ∑Èôµ‰∫∫‰πüÔºåÁÇ∫ÈÉ°Á∏£ÂêèÔºåÈÅø‰∫ÇÂçóÊ∏°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 60.

During an inspection tour of Wu Commandery, Sun Quan summoned all the county chiefs and assistant officials for a review of every county's stores and legal administration. L√º Dai impressed Sun Quan when he responded well to his questions and showed that everything under his watch was in perfect order. Sun Quan then reassigned him to be a clerk in his personal administrative office, and later appointed him as the Chief of Yuyao County. During his tenure, L√º Dai recruited over 1,000 able-bodied men to serve in Sun Quan's army.(Ê¨äË¶™Êñ∑Ë´∏Á∏£ÂÄâÂ∫´ÂèäÂõöÁπ´ÔºåÈï∑‰∏ûÁöÜË¶ãÔºåÂ≤±ËôïÊ≥ïÊáâÂïèÔºåÁîöÁ®±Ê¨äÊÑèÔºåÂè¨ÁΩ≤ÈåÑ‰∫ãÔºåÂá∫Ë£úÈ§òÂßöÈï∑ÔºåÂè¨ÂãüÁ≤æÂÅ•ÔºåÂæóÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 60.

L√º Dai and Jiang Qin succeeded in their mission and managed to pacify the five counties and capture the two rebel leaders.

On the journey back, L√º Dai passed by Baidicheng (in present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing) and met Sun Quan's ally Liu Bei, who was leading an army to seize control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor Liu Zhang. He saw that Liu Bei's army was in disarray and had lost about half their total number of troops, and felt convinced that Liu Bei would not succeed in conquering Yi Province. After returning to Jiangdong, he told Sun Quan, who in turn asked his adviser Wu Fan (), who had previously predicted that Liu Bei would conquer Yi Province. Wu Fan replied: \\"My prediction is based on Heaven's will.

Role in the Sun‚ÄìLiu territorial dispute In 215, when Sun Quan had a territorial dispute with his ally Liu Bei in Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), he ordered L√º Dai, with Sun Mao () and nine other officers as his deputies, to lead troops to seize control of the three commanderies of Changsha, Lingling (Èõ∂Èôµ; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (Ê°ÇÈôΩ; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan).(Âª∫ÂÆâ‰∫åÂçÅÂπ¥ÔºåÁù£Â≠´ËåÇÁ≠âÂçÅÂ∞áÂæûÂèñÈï∑Ê≤ô‰∏âÈÉ°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 60. The officials in four counties ‚Äì Ancheng, You, Yongxin and Chaling ‚Äì moved to Yinshan County (Èô∞Â±±Á∏£; southeast of present-day Hengdong County, Hunan), where they declared hostility towards L√º Dai. In response, L√º Dai led his troops to besiege and attack Yinshan County, and succeeded in forcing the rebellious officials to surrender. The three commanderies in southern Jing Province thus came firmly under Sun Quan's control.(ÂèàÂÆâÊàê„ÄÅÊî∏„ÄÅÊ∞∏Êñ∞„ÄÅËå∂ÈôµÂõõÁ∏£ÂêèÂÖ±ÂÖ•Èô∞Â±±ÂüéÔºåÂêàË°ÜÊãíÂ≤±ÔºåÂ≤±ÊîªÂúçÔºåÂç≥ÈôçÔºå‰∏âÈÉ°ÂÖãÂÆö„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 60. Sun Quan left L√º Dai in charge of Changsha. Around the time, Wu Dang (), the Chief of Ancheng County, conspired with a military officer Yuan Long () to rebel against Sun Quan and defect to Guan Yu, the general guarding Liu Bei's territories in southern Jing Province.

After L√º Dai assumed office, Qian Bo (), a bandit chief from Gaoliang Commandery (È´òÊ∂ºÈÉ°; around present-day Yangjiang, Guangdong) led his followers to surrender to him.

Under orders from Sun Quan, L√º Dai led his troops to attack the bandits and succeeded in capturing Wang Jin alive. He then sent Wang Jin as a captive to the Wu imperial capital, Jianye (present- day Nanjing, Jiangsu). Throughout the campaign, he had killed, captured and released about 10,000 bandits in total. In recognition of L√º Dai's efforts, Sun Quan promoted him to General Who Stabilises the South (), granted him acting imperial authority, and enfeoffed him as a Marquis of a Chief District ().(ÊòØÊôÇÊ°ÇÈôΩÊπûÈôΩË≥äÁéãÈáëÂêàË°ÜÊñºÂçóÊµ∑Áïå‰∏äÔºåÈ¶ñ‰∫ÇÁÇ∫ÂÆ≥ÔºåÊ¨äÂèàË©îÂ≤±Ë®é‰πãÔºåÁîüÁ∏õÈáëÔºåÂÇ≥ÈÄÅË©£ÈÉΩÔºåÊñ¨È¶ñÁç≤ÁîüÂá°Ëê¨È§ò‰∫∫„ÄÇÈÅ∑ÂÆâÂçóÂ∞áËªçÔºåÂÅáÁØÄÔºåÂ∞ÅÈÉΩÈÑâ‰æØ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 60.

At the same time, he ordered other officers such as Tang Zi to lead their units to Jiao Province to support L√º Dai. After about a year, L√º Dai succeeded in defeating the rebels and restoring peace in the various commanderies. He also executed the rebel leaders Liao Shi, Fei Yang () and their followers.

Junzis sing praises of your virtues while the people admire you for your values. I heard that every day you have piles of documents to look through and an endless queue of people to meet, yet you neither put aside your work nor complain that you are tired. I even heard that you can get onto horseback without stepping on the stirrups. It looks like you have surpassed Lian Po. How wonderful it is for you to have all these achievements!

It is situated in the Uplands area of the city at 36 St. James Crescent.Ffynone House School Trust, Estyn, 17 September 2013. The school teaches children from age 11 to 18 (Year 7 to GCSE and A Level). It is owned by a charitable trust. Description Ffynone campus is situated next to St. James‚Äôs Park in the Uplands area of Swansea. Facilities in Ffynone House School include a learning resource centre, laboratories, gymnasium, a drama studio, a music room and two art studios in addition to two computer suites. Classes are relatively small. All pupils follow a common curriculum considered compulsory by educational authorities up until the end of GCSE. Ffynone has a tradition of extra-curricular sporting activities, including table tennis, football, rugby, hockey, cross-country and gymnastics, taking place at lunch- times and after school. The school has no playing fields of its own but instead, pupils use facilities at the nearby Swansea University. Pupils have access to other activities, such as debating, music, drama, dance as part of the curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. History Ffynone House School was opened in 1973 by a Swansea Businessman Mr Marshall David. The School was a former convent school, St Winifrede's Convent School, run by nuns from 1887-1969 and throughout the Second World War. The School's motto is \\"Where Individuals Matter\\". Previous mottos were \\"Non Sibi Sed Omnibus\\" (\\"Not for one's self but for all\\"), virtus (virtue), and \\"Endeavour-Achievement- Excellence\\". In 2007, the school was purchased by Cognita, a private schools company. However, ownership of Ffynone House School was transferred back to the charitable trust that had previously operated it later in the year, and the school remains open today. Science Ffynone House School offers Chemistry, Biology and Physics as independent subjects throughout the School. Pupils from the School regularly participate in science-based competitions and have enjoyed success in the South West Wales Chemical Olympiad Competition. In 2009 the School Chemical Olympiad team came third in the UK in the Royal Society of Chemistry 'Top of the Bench' competition. They continued this success with further wins, coming 7th in 2012 in the Top of The Bench Competition, in 2019 the school chemical Olympiad team advanced to the national finals and secured a top place in the country. More recently they came runners up in wales in the competition, however they could not secure a place in the national finals due to apparent cheating by the opposition team from Christ college. 2019 exam results All qualifications, with the exception of ICT, are the more demanding English specifications and are graded using the 9-1 system.

He was an associate professor of Business Administration at the University of Haifa as well as a member of the editorial board of the Middle East Quarterly, a publication of the Middle East Forum think tank. Biography Steven Plaut was born in Philadelphia. In 1981, Plaut immigrated to Israel with his family. He died on January 17, 2017, in Haifa, Israel at the age of 65 after battling cancer for many years. Academic career Plaut received his undergraduate degree from Temple University in Philadelphia and his MA from Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He received a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University, specializing in international and urban economics and later in finance. Plaut worked at the Federal Reserve Bank. Before his professorship at the Haifa University, he taught at Oberlin College, the Technion, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, Central European University, Tel Aviv University, University of Nantes, and Athens Laboratory for Business Administration. Literary career In his 1985 book titled The Joy of Capitalism, Plaut argues for free market economics and compares the profit motive to the libido. In the book he discusses energy, housing, banking and agricultural policy as well as equality and income distribution. In his 2002 book The Scout Steven Plaut describes his near-death experience as a kidney cancer patient at an intensive care ward. The historical novel is a series of life stories exchanged between him and another patient in the ward, an Israeli Bedouin scout. Political views Steven Plaut was an outspoken critic of the Israeli-Arab peace process and Israel's unilateral withdrawal policy. Since the Oslo Accords, he argued that Arab leaders would continue to seek the destruction of Israel through violence and terrorism. Some of his political writings are criticisms of Nakba Day. Plaut was critical of many Israeli left- wing figures, as well as some Americans such as Michael Lerner and Norman Finkelstein, whom he described as self-hating Jews and apologists for terrorism that are promoting the destruction of Israel. Plaut was opposed to what he saw as left-wing extremism in Israeli universities, and was actively involved in Isracampus, a self-proclaimed watchdog organization that publicizes anti-Israel people and groups. In the Canadian Jewish Tribune, he denounced Anarchists Against the Wall, a group protesting the Israeli West Bank barrier which he said was composed of \\"violent hooligans and anarcho- fascist thugs.\\" Libel case Plaut was sued for libel by Neve Gordon, a faculty member at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Department of Politics and Government, claiming that Plaut slandered him in certain articles and alleged e-mails. In May 2006, the Nazareth Magistrate's Court ruled in favor of Gordon, and ordered Plaut to pay Gordon 80,000 shekels in compensation plus 15,000 shekels in legal fees. Both sides appealed to the Nazareth District Court, and in February 2008, the court reversed three out of four of the libel claims but upheld a libel judgment relating to the fourth, a publication in which Plaut called Gordon a \\"Judenrat Wannabe\\". It reduced the damages to 10,000 shekels (about $2,700) on the basis that, in the court's view, Plaut was entitled to criticize Gordon. ◊¢\\"◊ê (◊†◊¶◊®◊™) 1184/06 - ◊§◊®◊ï◊§' ◊°◊ò◊ô◊ë◊ü ◊§◊ú◊ê◊ï◊ò ◊†' ◊ì\\"◊® ◊†◊ô◊ë ◊í◊ï◊®◊ì◊ï◊ü . ◊™◊ß-◊û◊ó 2008(1), 11886.

The letter condemned as illegal Turkey's occupation of Northern Cyprus and attacked the Turkish Prime Minister, accusing him of being behind the Gaza Flotilla \\"terrorist attack\\" on Israeli soldiers.

Biography Nathan was born into a prominent New York Sephardic family. He was educated in the United States and Switzerland and attended Harvard University for several years beginning in 1912. It was there that he began writing short fiction and poetry. However, he never graduated, choosing instead to drop out and take a job at an advertising firm to support his family (he married while a junior at Harvard). It was while working in 1919 that he wrote his first novel‚Äîthe semi-autobiographical work Peter Kindred‚Äîwhich was a critical failure. But his luck soon changed during the 1920s, when he wrote seven more novels, including The Bishop's Wife, which was later made into a successful film starring Cary Grant, David Niven, and Loretta Young. During the 1930s, his success continued with more works, including fictional pieces and poetry. In 1940, he wrote his most successful book, Portrait of Jennie, about a Depression-era artist and the woman he is painting, who is slipping through time. Portrait of Jennie is considered a modern masterpiece of fantasy fiction and was made into a film, starring Jennifer Jones and Joseph Cotten. In January 1956 the author wrote, as well as narrated, an episode of the CBS Radio Workshop, called \\"A Pride of Carrots, or Venus Well-Served\\". Nathan's seventh wife was the British actress Anna Lee, to whom he was married from 1970 until his death. He came from a talented family‚Äîthe activist Maud Nathan and author Annie Nathan Meyer were his aunts, and the poet Emma Lazarus and Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo his cousins.

He was an ally of the warlord Yuan Shao and Yuan Shao's son and successor Yuan Shang. Life Tadun was a younger relative of the Wuhuan chieftain Qiuliju, and he was well-known for his wisdom, command skills, strength and ferocity among the Wuhuan people. After Qiuliju died sometime in the early 190s, Tadun succeeded him as the new Wuhuan leader because Qiuliju's son, Louban (Ê®ìÁè≠), was too young at the time. Tadun not only ruled over the Wuhuan tribes in Liaoxi Commandery (ÈÅºË•øÈÉ°; around present-day Lulong County, Hebei), but also those in Youbeiping (Âè≥ÂåóÂπ≥; around present-day Tangshan, Hebei), Yuyang (ÊºÅÈôΩ; around present-day Miyun District, Beijing) and Shanggu (‰∏äË∞∑; around present-day Yanqing District, Beijing) commanderies. Throughout the 190s, Tadun supported the warlord Yuan Shao in his power struggle against Gongsun Zan for supremacy in northern China. In return for Tadun's support, Yuan Shao awarded imperial seals and honours to Tadun and the Wuhuan chieftains in the name of Emperor Xian, the figurehead emperor of the Eastern Han dynasty. After Louban had grown up, Tadun passed him the reins of power but continued to remain in charge of the Wuhuan tribes in Liaoxi Commandery. The other Wuhuan chieftains, such as Nanlou (Èõ£Ê®ì), Supuyan (ËòáÂÉïÂª∂) and Wuyan (ÁÉèÂª∂), pledged allegiance to Louban as their new leader. Following Yuan Shao's death in 202, his son and successor Yuan Shang continued maintaining friendly ties with the Wuhuan. When Yuan Shang was defeated by his father's rival Cao Cao and forced to flee further north, he took shelter under Tadun and the Wuhuan tribes. Tadun attempted to help Yuan Shang regain control over the territories in northern China but to no avail. In 207, Cao Cao personally led his forces on a campaign against Yuan Shang and the Wuhuan tribes. By the time the Wuhuan realised that Cao Cao was on his way to attack them, it was a little too late but they still managed to muster thousands of horsemen to fight the enemy. Both sides clashed at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain near Liucheng (Êü≥Âüé; southwest of present-day Chaoyang, Liaoning).

The main offices are located in Fayetteville in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, USA. The Michaux State Forest is in several tracts covering more than located in Adams County, southern Cumberland County, eastern Franklin County, and northwestern York County. History The lake in October 2007, with the water receded by 30 feet Michaux State Forest is named for Andr√© Michaux, a French botanist. He was dispatched in 1785 by King Louis XVI of France and his Queen Marie Antoinette to gather plants for the Royal Gardens. Michaux State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists such as Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. A map of the state forest showing forest boundaries and nearby highways. The land that is now Michaux State Forest was once owned by several large iron companies. The iron companies used the old growth forests of South Central Pennsylvania to fire their iron furnaces such as Pine Grove Furnace, Caledonia, and Mont Alto. Colliers gathered the wood and created charcoal by slowly burning the logs in massive charcoal kilns that dotted the landscape of what is now Michaux State Forest. Michaux State Forest is the location of several \\"firsts\\" in Pennsylvania Forestry. The first state nursery was established at Mont Alto in 1902. Rothrock opened the first forestry school in Pennsylvania and the second in the United States at what is now Penn State Mont Alto. Michaux State Forest saw the first wooden fire tower in 1905 as well as the first steel fire tower in 1914. Michaux State Forest is now a thriving second growth forest. It is open to recreational hunting, fishing, hiking and mountain biking. It is crossed by the Appalachian Trail. Remnants of the charcoal days can still be seen in the state forest as the land where the kilns burned for so many years has yet to fully recover. Visitors to the park will notice these areas as large grassy meadows that are surrounded by the woods of Michaux State Forest.

In a political career spanning twenty years, he represented the electorate of Camberwell in the Victorian Legislative Assembly and held many positions in the Victorian Cabinet. He is best known today as the initiator of the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop, but also delivered a memorable speech to parliament in 1971 in favour of building a railway line to complement the Eastern Freeway. Wilcox was born in Camberwell, a suburb of Melbourne. He was educated at Carey Baptist Grammar School, where he won the \\"Henry Meeks Medal for Leadership, Scholarship and Athletics\\" in 1932 and 1935 and acted as School Captain from 1935 to 1936. Wilcox maintained an interest in the school long after he graduated, and from 1963 to 1970 he served on the school council. After secondary school, Wilcox went on to study law at the University of Melbourne. He matriculated shortly before the outbreak of World War II, and joined the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve, serving as a Lieutenant from 1942 to 1945. During his time in the Navy, he worked as liaison officer to the United States of America's Seventh Fleet. After the war, Wilcox put his degree into practice, joining his father's firm, Hall and Wilcox, in 1946. In the 1940s, Wilcox became active in the Liberal Party but, in 1952, he contested the seat of Camberwell unsuccessfully, as a member of the break-away Electoral Reform Party. Back in the Liberal Party fold, he successfully contested Camberwell at a 1956 by-election. In 1964, he became a Cabinet Minister, being appointed Assistant Chief Secretary, Assistant Attorney- General, and Minister for Immigration. In 1965, he remained Assistant Attorney-General, but replaced the other two portfolios with the role of Minister for Labour and Industry. In 1967, he was made Minister for Transport, and in 1973, he became Attorney General. Wilcox retired from Parliament in 1976. Looking back over his career, he cited turning the first sod on the project to build the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop in June 1971 as his proudest memory. In 2001, Wilcox wrote Minister for the Crown, in which he reflected on his life in pre-war Melbourne, and his career in politics as a member of the Bolte and Hamer Ministries. The book's foreword was penned by Geoffrey Blainey. In 1998, Wilcox was selected as a delegate to the fourth Constitutional Convention, running on a \\"Safeguard the People\\" ticket. His mission at the Convention was to ensure that any modifications made to the Australian Constitution towards a Republic maintained the present checks and balances against Centralism and the power of the Executive and the Judiciary. He argued, \\"We have had a Constitution, rightly or wrongly, that has been significantly destabilised, a generation of young people ... who believe we have a bad Constitution, paradoxically, when it is in fact the best in the world.\\"\\"Inspired by Machiavelli and Mac the Mouth\\", The Australian, 5 February 1998 Wilcox was a keen sportsman. He played cricket as a wicket-keeper at university and later for Richmond Cricket Club, and in later life would be a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Ground and maintained a long association with the Camberwell Magpies Cricket Club. He was also involved for decades with the Returned and Services League of Australia and the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria. He was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1976. Wilcox married his wife Jean in 1942, and the couple had four children and thirteen grandchildren. He died in 2004, at the age of 84. Notes References *Condolences: Hon.

It is a colourful town largely unknown by tourists, who generally head straight for towns such as San Pedro de Atacama. The town is considered unspoiled, with the benefit of having absolutely no high rise buildings. On the arid hills nearby is a lighthouse which casts a beam over the town during the night. Throughout the day and night, there is a lively, bustling atmosphere on the narrow streets. Despite it being coastal, it is not a typical seaside resort, partly because the ocean is contaminated by the copper mining industry. Situated a short distance to the north is the Pan de Az√∫car National Park. History In 1824, Diego de Almeyda made the discovery of the large natural deposits of copper in the area, and was the first in the mining industry in Chile to export it. For this reason, the town was founded October 26, 1833 as Cha√±aral de las √Ånimas (\\"Cha√±ar field of the Souls\\"). A few of years later, Pedro Lujan discovered ore at El Salado, where a mine was built. In 1836, a shipping port promising raw material was constructed. The great boom Cha√±aral began in 1860 when A. Edwards & Company was inaugurated where an inn exists today. Demographics According to the 2002 census by the National Statistics Institute (INE) the commune of Cha√±aral spans an area of and had 13,543 inhabitants (6,968 men and 6,575 women). Of these, 13,180 (97.3%) lived in urban areas and 363 (2.7%) in rural areas. The population fell by 2.8% (393 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The demonym for a person from Cha√±aral is Cha√±aralino for a man and Cha√±aralina for a woman. Administration As a commune, Cha√±aral is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde was Hector Volta Rojas (PRSD), and the council has the following members: * Carmen Rojas Cornejo (RN) * Isabel Ogalde √Ålvarez (PS) * Margarita Flores Salazar (PRSD) * Mary √Ålamos Guti√©rrez (PDC) * Mery Schampke Galleguillos (PPD) * Omar Monroy L√≥pez (PRI) Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Cha√±aral is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Lautaro Carmona (PC) and Carlos Vilches (UDI) as part of the 5th electoral district, (together with Diego de Almagro and Copiap√≥). The commune is represented in the Senate by Isabel Allende Bussi (PS) and Baldo Prokurica Prokurica (RN) as part of the 3rd senatorial constituency (Atacama).

The group started out in 1992 and is still active today with various members and led by Daniel Loria, son of founding member Art Loria. The group has also performed and recorded under the names \\"The Royal All Stars\\" and \\"Golden Group Memories\\". The 3 related names were all part of what started out as \\"The Royal All Stars\\". The original lineup included: * Art Loria * Vito Balsamo * Randy Silverman * Eugene Pitt * Lenny Welch This original lineup recorded a live album \\"Live at the Taj -Royally Yours\\" while performing at a celebration for the chief running officer of the Trump Taj Mahal Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. It was to be released from Dazzle Records sometime in late 2012‚Äì2013. in 1993, Lenny Welch left the group and headed for the West Coast to pursue his ambitions in the acting field and also reconcentrate on his solo efforts. He was replaced by BJ Jones, who was a member of such groups as The Dubs, The Drifters and The Five Satins. Taking over for Jones was Jimmy Merchant: an original member of Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers. Merchant, along with Pitt, Loria, Silverman, Balsamo and Daniel Loria spent the years 1992‚Äì1998 touring and performing all over the country in major markets, major venues and the cruise line circuits. They have several recordings still not released, but were expected in 2012‚Äì1013. As \\"The Royal All Stars\\", they were a regular in the then active Pittsburgh doo wop scene (performed at the famous \\"PORKSTOCK\\" at Three Rivers Stadium in honor of legendary jock Porky Chadwick). They also performed in Las Vegas, California, and Ohio many times. This lineup performed their last show in 1998 at Windows on the World atop the World Trade Towers. 1998 saw the group split into two factions, with Silverman and Balsamo going on as \\"Golden Group Memories\\", and Pitt along with the Lorias' continued as \\"The Doo Wop All Stars\\". The year 2000 saw a new lineup of \\"The Doo Wop All Stars\\" that included Artie Loria, Eugene Pitt, Harold Gill (from the Continentals / The Drifters), Maurice Unthank (from The Teenagers/ Jive Five). This incarnation of the group saw the next 7 years of active performances and recordings. In 2003 they recorded \\"It's Christmas\\" on It Doesn't Matter Music label. It was credited to \\"Pitt-Knick\\", a name play on Eugene Pitt and the groups long lasting relationship recording many of the famous \\"NIC NIC NIC \\" bumper commercials with the TV network Nickelodeon in the beginning stages of the new network. In 2001, they recorded \\"We Will Never Fall\\" as a tribute to the heroes and victims of 9/11. In 2007, Pitt's health issues caused the group to cut down on their touring, and eventually Pitt was replaced by Freddie Scott. After Scott died after a brief illness, The Doo Wop All Stars continued on with Artie Loria, Danny Loria and Harold Gilly. Art Loria was killed in a home accident on October 23, 2010. Gill is currently performing with The Continentals when not with \\"The Doo Wop All Stars\\". Lenny Welch still performs as a solo artist and occasionally acts in bit parts. Danny Loria, now manages the name \\"Doo Wop All Stars\\" and is currently working on releasing years of shelved recordings. He and Gill also have plans to re- engage steady performing in 2012 with a list of engagements. Balsamo performs with various local cover bands. Sillverman has retierd due to illness.

Kapus are primarily an agrarian community, forming a heterogeneous peasant caste. They are classified as a Forward Caste in Andhra Pradesh, where they are the dominant community in the districts of East Godavari and West Godavari. They are distinct from three other Kapu communities that were present in the state prior to its bifurcation with the creation of Telangana in 2014. The Munnuru Kapu are found primarily in Telangana, the Turpu Kapu in the areas of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam, and the Balija in Rayalaseema. The first two of these other three communities are classified as Other Backward Classes. Etymology KƒÅpu literally means cultivator or agriculturist in Telugu. Various subgroups of Kapus branched off into separate communities in the post-Kakatiya period (Velamas, Panta Kapus and Pakanati Kapus‚Äîboth of whom got labelled Reddys, and Kapus of Kammanadu‚Äîeventually labelled Kammas). The remaining Kapus continue to use the original label. All the cultivator caste clusters have a common ancestry in the legends. According to Cynthia Talbot, the transformation of occupational identities as caste labels occurred in the late Vijayanagara period (17th century) or later. Status The Kapu are considered to be a Shudra community in the traditional Hindu ritual ranking system known as varna. The Kapu have been described by Srinivasulu as a \\"dominant peasant caste in coastal Andhra\\", with the Telaga listed as \\"a backward peasant caste\\" and the Balija as a peasant caste who hold Lingayat beliefs. Srinisavulu has analysed the 1921 census of India to cause alignment with the present-day state and classification system, from which he concludes that Kapus (including Reddys) amounted to around 17 percent of the state's then population and were regarded as a Forward caste, whilst the Balija and Telaga were regarded as Backward castes, comprising 3 percent and 5 percent of the 1921 population, respectively. Srinivasulu notes that the Reddys and Kammas are the politically dominant communities of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and that the Kapus are among a group with lesser but still significant influence, despite their small population. They are particularly effective in the districts of East Godavari and West Godavari, although Srinivasulu notes that \\"The Kapus of the coastal districts are distinct from the Munnur Kapus of Telangana. While the former are fairly prosperous, the political emergence of the latter, who are part of the OBC category, is a recent phenomenon.\\" The official government classifications rarely distinguished between the Kapu sub-castes. All Kapus were classified as forming a backward caste in 1915 by the British government of the Madras Presidency, which remained in force even after the formation of Andhra Pradesh until 1956. In that year, the government of Andhra Pradesh removed Kapus from the list of backward castes. Even though various governments have since made efforts to include them again, the efforts have not been successful. In 1968, the Anantha Raman Commission set up by the Andhra Pradesh government recognised Munnuru Kapus and Turpu Kapus as backward classes, but not the Kapus as a whole. The Mandal Commission set up by the Government of India in the 1980s recommended that Kapus be included among the Other Backward Classes (OBC). But the state governments were entrusted with finalising the list of castes for the OBC category. The state commission headed by N. K.

Name In the traditional language, the name of this group is derived from the Bigambul word biga or pika which translates in English to yes. The Bigambul are bounded to the south‚Äìeast by the Ngarabal, the Kamilaroi to the south, the Kooma to the west, the Mandandanji and Kabi to the north, and the Baru≈ãgam to the north‚Äìeast. Country Norman Tindale ascribed to the Bigambul a traditional territory spreading over east of Nindigully, on the Weir and Moonie rivers, north to Tara; at Talwood; on the Macintyre River from east of Boomi to Texas; at Yetman, Boggabilla, and at Middle Creek. Alternate names * Bigabul * Pikambul * Bigambal * Bigambel * Bee-gum-bul * Bigumble * Pikumbul,'Pikumpal, Pikambal * Pikum-bul, Pickum-bul, Pickimbul * Pickumble, Picumbul, Pikumbil * Begumble * Peekumble * Pickumbil * Picumbill * Preagalgh * Wigal-wollumbul * Wee-n' gul-la-m' bul Source: Clans The Bigambul have a cultural connection with the northern Kamilaroi people and these people regularly participated in joint ceremonies at Boobera Lagoon. Language The Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies states that the Bigambul language was used by the Bigambul people, with Gambuwal and Kwiambal (or Gujambal) known dialects. However, it is more likely that the Gamilaraay (or Yuwaaliyaay) language was used by those peoples living in southern Bigambul territory. History of contact The Bigambul people actively opposed European colonisation of their territory. From the early 1840s they mounted a 14‚Äìyear guerrilla campaign to expel the settlers. The Bigambul leadership understood the importance of economics in warfare and they specifically targeted horses and cattle rather than just the settlers themselves. The campaign was initially successful with 17 selections being abandoned in Macintyre region in 1843, of which only 13 were re-occupied when Europeans returned 3 years later. The economic war was so successful that it is recorded that one selection was making a loss of ¬£150 per year until 1849. The tide of the campaign turned in 1848 when the Governor set aside ¬£1000 to form the Native Police and appointed Frederick Walker to command them. Walker took the battle to the Bigambul, attacking them in their camps with his stated objective being their annihilation. By 1851 the economic war was effectively over, land values in the area doubled and the wages paid by settlers to employees were halved. Most of the work done on selections in the area was performed by Aborigines in return for food rations. By 1854 only 100 of the Bigambul people were left alive. Native title On 23 February 2001 the Bigambul people lodged a successful native title claim over in South Western Queensland.

It was founded in 1999 and in February 2011 had 380 members. Aims and history Annals and chronicles were the main genres of historical writing in the Middle Ages. Consequently, they have always been of great importance to historians. The extent to which they are also of interest to students of medieval literature or of historical linguistics was only fully realised in the latter part of the 20th century. Since many chronicles are illustrated, they are also a fruitful object of study for art historians. It was the desire for a forum in which these disciplines could operate together that led to the foundation of the society. The history of the society began with a series of triennial conferences initially in Utrecht, but later moving from place to place. These early conferences were hosted by Erik Kooper (English studies, Utrecht). It was at the second of these conferences, in 1999, that the society was formally founded. The society maintains a website financed by the University of Liverpool, and publishes a regular newsletter with information on recent publications in the chronicles field. Journal The Medieval Chronicle The journal The Medieval Chronicle Volumes of proceedings of the first three conferences were published by Rodopi.The Medieval Chronicle volumes 1‚Äì3, Rodopi, 1999‚Äì2004. When the society was founded, this triennial publication was transformed into a yearbook, now the peer-reviewed journal The Medieval Chronicle.The Medieval Chronicle volumes 4‚Äì , Rodopi, 2006‚Äì , ISSN 1567-2336. The journal is trilingual, with articles in English, French and German. As well as the proceedings of the society's conferences, and also of the Cambridge Chronicle Symposium, the journal includes research submitted independently of the conferences. A number of text editions of chronicles have also been published here.

It was an attempt to escape from the unprofitable low end of the market, and one of the last calculators Sinclair produced. Made with a case of pressed steel that a variety of finishes, it cost between and at a time when other calculators could be purchased for under . A number of factors meant that the Sovereign was not a commercial success, including the cost, high import levies on components, competition from cheaper calculators manufactured abroad, and the development of more power-efficient designs using liquid-crystal displays. Though it came with a five-year guarantee, issues such as short battery life limited its usefulness. The company moved on to producing computers soon afterwards. The design by John Pemberton won a Design Council award, and there are examples of the Sovereign in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It had a Mostek MK50321N main integrated circuit and a small memory register, a LED display, and could perform a variety of a number of basic mathematical operations besides four-function arithmetic. History The Sovereign was one of the last calculators produced during Sinclair's foray into the calculator market that had started with the Sinclair Executive in September 1972. The Executive had retailed for when introduced, but in little over a year it was possible to purchase a Sinclair calculator for and by November 1976 a model was available for . Cheaper calculators with liquid-crystal displays instead of light- emitting diodes were becoming more popular, and had much longer battery lives of months or years. Such calculators were available for well under , with all the functionality of the more expensive models. The impossibility of selling \\"simple\\" calculators profitably led Sinclair to introduce models such as the Cambridge Scientific, introduced in August 1975 at a price of . The Sovereign, released in 1976, represented an attempt to move upmarket in an increasingly saturated market. In December 1976, the chrome plated version of the Sovereign cost and the gold-plated version , including VAT, but profit margins on the Sovereign were so small that Sinclair ended up selling the Sovereign at a loss, and it was not a commercial success. The Sovereign was made in England, like every other Sinclair calculator except the President. Sinclair would shortly stop producing calculators and instead focus on computers, starting with the MK14 in 1977. The loss of the calculator market was due in part to technological development leading to smaller and cheaper components, which put heavy pressure on profit margins. An import levy of up to 17.5% was placed on components, but the duty for calculators imported from Japan or Hong Kong could be as little as 5%, making it unprofitable to produce calculators in the UK. Sinclair also had some problems with the reliability of earlier calculators that had adversely affected its reputation, but the Sovereign was sold with a \\"full and unconditional\\" five year guarantee. Design The Sovereign came in satin chrome and gold-plated models, with leather pouches and fitted wooden cases. It had an 8-digit seven-segment display that used red light-emitting diodes, with a decimal point to the right of each digit that could be illuminated as necessary. Power was provided by two 1.35 mercury button cells. The Sovereign measured , which made it small and sleek compared to other calculators of the time. The Sovereign was unusual because the casing was made from pressed steel, which gave it a much higher quality feel compared to injection moulded plastic. This allowed a variety of paint and plating options, including black painted, chrome-plated, silver-plated, and gold- plated, and a limited edition silver-plated version, inscribed to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, were also produced. Asprey of London was rumoured to have produced two Sovereigns in solid gold, costing each. The design, by John Pemberton, won the Design Council Award in 1977, as the Executive had in 1973, and there are examples in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Sovereigns are highly collectible, and used models command high prices. Functions As well as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and the ability to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator. A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error. An independent memory register could read information from the screen, and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations. The Sovereign used a Mostek MK50321N main integrated circuit, the same as the Sinclair Wrist Calculator and some variants of the Sinclair Cambridge. Clive Sinclair had assumed that people would prefer attractive illuminated LED displays to LCD displays, which incidentally also required more expensive CMOS chips. However, his calculators were designed with the assumption they would be turned off between calculations, which did not prove to be the case. Advertisements suggested that the batteries would last \\"about a year\\" under normal use, but in reality the small button cell batteries and comparatively high power consumption meant a short battery life compared to the competition.

Life Little is known about Zhang Song's origins except that he started his career as an adviser to Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province during the Eastern Han dynasty. His appointment was Aide-de-camp (Âà•ÈßïÂæû‰∫ã). Around 211, when Liu Zhang received news that Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian, was planning to attack Zhang Lu, another warlord in the neighbouring Hanzhong Commandery, he became fearful that Cao Cao would attack Yi Province after defeating Zhang Lu. During this time, Zhang Song advised Liu Zhang to invite Liu Bei, a warlord based in the adjacent Jing Province, to lead his troops into Yi Province and help Liu Zhang deal with Zhang Lu. Liu Zhang heeded Zhang Song's advice and ordered his subordinate Fa Zheng to lead 4,000 men to welcome Liu Bei into Yi Province, in addition to presenting Liu Bei with several precious gifts. Liu Bei led thousands of his troops into Yi Province and met Liu Zhang at Fu County (Ê∂™Á∏£; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan). He also met Zhang Song and Fa Zheng, who willingly provided him with crucial information about Yi Province such as geography, supplies and deployment of military forces. Zhang Song even drew a map of Yi Province and gave it to Liu Bei. As time passed, Zhang Song conceived the idea of betraying Liu Zhang and helping Liu Bei seize control of Yi Province from Liu Zhang, so he contacted Fa Zheng, who agreed to join him. In 213, Zhang Song's brother Zhang Su (ÂºµËÇÖ), who was serving as a commandery administrator under Liu Zhang, found out about his brother's plot. Afraid of being implicated, Zhang Su secretly reported his brother's plot to Liu Zhang, who had Zhang Song arrested and executed. When Liu Bei heard about Zhang Song's death, he exclaimed, \\"Junjiao killed my spy!\\" Zhang Su looked very different from his brother as he was a tall man with an imposing and majestuous appearance while Zhang Song was a rather short man who did not exercise restraint and was known as debauched. However, Zhang Song was also a very knowledgeable man with a good discernment hence he possessed talent and ability. When Liu Zhang sent him to Cao Cao, Cao Cao wasn't polite to him. But the current master of records Yang Xiu deeply respected him. And even recommended Cao Cao to have Zhang Song joined his personal staff but Cao Cao didn't listen to him. When Yang Xiu showed him the military books that Cao Cao had written, Zhang Song quickly had all of them read and memorized them through and through. After this event, Yang Xiu esteemed him even more.The Miscellaneous Records of the Elders of Yi Province In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Zhang Song is portrayed as a short, buck-toothed man with a short nose, who does not command respect for his ugly looks. In the novel, his courtesy name is Yongnian (Ê∞∏Âπ¥). Liu Zhang sends Zhang Song as an envoy to meet Cao Cao. He brings with him a map of Yi Province and hopes to present it to Cao Cao and aid him in conquering Yi Province from Liu Zhang. However, Cao Cao dislikes Zhang Song for his appearance and treats him rudely. In retaliation, Zhang Song makes sarcastic remarks to humiliate Cao Cao, who orders his men to beat up Zhang Song and chase him away. Zhang Song is deeply upset by Cao Cao's attitude towards him so he leaves for Jing Province and meets Liu Bei along the way. Liu Bei treats Zhang Song like an honoured guest. Zhang Song is so impressed with Liu Bei's hospitality that he presents the map to Liu Bei and urges him to conquer Yi Province from Liu Zhang. He also introduces his colleagues Fa Zheng and Meng Da to Liu Bei and tells him that they will aid him in defeating Liu Zhang. Zhang Song is executed by Liu Zhang after the latter discovers that he is plotting against him. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms Notes References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Shortly after having Cunda's meal, the Buddha suffered from fatal dysentery. Before entering the parinirvƒÅ·πáa, the Buddha told ƒÄnanda to visit Cunda and tell him that his meal had nothing to do with his getting ill, and therefore should feel no blame nor remorse; on the contrary, offering the TathƒÅgata his last meal before passing away was of equal gain as of offering him his first meal before attaining buddhahood, and thus he should feel rejoice. Name The name KammƒÅraputta (in Sanskrit, KarmƒÅraputra) means son of the smith. In Chinese, his name is rendered as Ê∫ñÈôÄ (Zh«întu√≥). Cunda as a lay follower of Gautama Buddha In the Cunda KammƒÅraputta Sutta, Gautama Buddha stays at Cunda's mango grove and they talk about rites of purification. Cunda declares that he approves of the rites of the brahmins of the West and the Buddha mentions that the rites of purification of these brahmins and the purification in the discipline of the noble ones is quite different. Cunda asks him to explain how there is purification in his discipline, and so the Buddha teaches him the ten courses of skillful action. Cunda praises him for his teachings and declares himself a lay follower from that day on. Cunda's Meal In the MahƒÅparinibbƒÅ·πáa Sutta, Gautama Buddha and a group of bhikkus stay at Cunda's mango grove and are offered by him a meal. The meal consists of sweet rice, cakes and s≈´karamaddava, which is translated differently depending on the buddhist tradition. Since the word is composed by s≈´kara, which means pig, and maddava, which means soft, tender, delicate, two alternatives are possible: # Tender pig or boar meat. # What is enjoyed by pigs and boars. In the latter meaning, the term has been thought to refer to a mushroom or truffle, or a yam or tuber. The idea that the Buddha's last meal consisted of pork is generally supported by the Theravada tradition; while that it was a vegetarian dish, by the Mahayana tradition. These may reflect the different traditional views on Buddhist vegetarianism and the monastic precepts. In the sutta, the Buddha asks Cunda to serve the rice and cakes to the community of bhikkus, and to only serve the s≈´karamaddava to him. Any leftovers should be buried in a pit. Cunda does as he is told.

In essence, it is a synthesis of the Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy.Guy Durandin, Les Principes de la Philosophie. Introduction et notes, Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, Paris, 1970. It was written in Latin, published in 1644 and dedicated to Elisabeth of Bohemia, with whom Descartes had a long-standing friendship. A French version (Les Principes de la Philosophie) followed in 1647. The book sets forth the principles of nature‚Äîthe Laws of Physics‚Äîas Descartes viewed them. Most notably, it set forth the principle that in the absence of external forces, an object's motion will be uniform and in a straight line. Newton borrowed this principle from Descartes and included it in his own Principia; to this day, it is still generally referred to as Newton's First Law of Motion.D. T. Whiteside, \\"The prehistory of the Principia\\", Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 45/13 (1991). The book was primarily intended to replace the Aristotelian curriculum then used in French and British universities. The work provides a systematic statement of his metaphysics and natural philosophy, and represents the first truly comprehensive, mechanistic account of the universe.  Preface to the French edition  Descartes asked Abbot Claude Picot to translate his Latin Principia Philosophiae into French. For this edition he wrote a preface disguised as a letter to the translator, whose title is \\"Letter of the author to the translator of the book, that may be used as a preface.\\" This was published in 1647, a date already in the maturity final period of his life. In this writing Descartes pours some reflexions about his idea of wisdom and philosophy. Its content may be summarized as follows.  Concept of philosophy.  Philosophy is the study of wisdom, understood as the ability to conduct the human activities; and also as the perfect knowledge of all the things that a man can know for the direction of his life, maintenance of his health, and knowledge of the arts. Only God is perfectly wise, and the man is more or less wise, in proportion to the knowledge he has of the most important truths.  The degrees of knowledge  Descartes identifies four degrees of knowledge, he names common, and a fifth one he designates as higher. The first degree consists on clear and evident notions that can be acquired without need of any meditation. The second degree is all that is learned by means of the senses. The third comprises what we learn when talking with other men. The fourth consists on what we can learn from the writings of men capable of giving good instructions.  Higher wisdom  There have been great men in all times that have sought after a better and more secure wisdom, a fifth degree of knowledge. This has consisted on the search for the first causes, and those that have followed this pursuit have been named philosophers, but he thinks that no one has been successful yet.  Doubt and certainty  Since Plato and Aristotle there has been a discussion about doubt and certainty. Those that have favored doubt have arrived to extremes of doubting even the most evident things, and those that have sought certainty have relied excessively on senses. Though it is true that it has been accepted that the senses may mislead us, according to Descartes nobody had yet expressed that the truth can not be based on the senses, but in the understanding, when it is founded on evident perceptions.  Meditations on first philosophy  The search for the first causes, or basic truths, as undertaken by Descartes is contained in this work. It explains the metaphysical principles on which to build the rest of knowledge.  The tree of philosophy  The philosophy is like a tree, whose roots are the metaphysics, its trunk the physics, and the branches the rest of sciences, mainly medicine, mechanics, and morals that is the last level of wisdom. In the same way that the tree has its fruits in its outer parts, the usefulness of philosophy is also contained in the parts that are learnt at the end.

It is north of Bangkok. It is in the centre of Nan Province which bears its name, and of which it is the former administrative capital. It covers tambon Nai Wiang and parts of tambon Pha Sing of Mueang Nan District, an area of divided into 30 chumchon. In 2010 it had a population of 21,333 spread along the Nan River's right bank. Nan is a small city, primarily devoted to commercial, administrative, educational, and hospital activities. The old heart of the city, where Wat Phumin, the national museum and other tourist attractions are found, is being restored. History Nan for centuries was a separate, autonomous kingdom with few relationships with the outside world. There is evidence of prehistoric habitation, but it wasn't until several small mueang united to form Nanthaburi on the Nan River in the mid-14th century, contemporaneously with the creation of Luang Prabang and the Lan Xang (Million Elephants) kingdom in Laos, that the city became notable. Associated with the Sukhothai Kingdom, the mueang took the title Wara Nakhon and played a significant part in the development of early Thai nationalism. By the end of the 14th century Nan was one of the nine northern Thai-Lao principalities that formed Lan Na Thai (now Lanna). The city-state flourished throughout the 15th century under the name Chiang Klang ('middle city'), a reference to its position roughly midway between Chiang Mai ('new city') and Chiang Thong ('golden city'), today's Luang Prabang). The Burmese took control of the kingdom in 1558 and deported many of the inhabitants to Burma as slaves; the city was deserted until northern Thailand was retaken from the Burmese in 1786. The local dynasty then regained local sovereignty and it remained semi-autonomous until 1931 when Nan finally accepted full Bangkok dominion. Part of its territory had been annexed to Laos by the French in the late-19th century. Parts of the old city wall and several early wats dating from the Lanna period can be seen in contemporary Nan. The city's wats are distinctive; some temple structures show Lanna influence, while others belong to the Thai Lue legacy brought from Xishuangbanna in China, where the Thai Lue people originated.

Whilst the GPA was released, Gillette put the product on hold after a short time due to economic and pricing uncertainties.

The first model was the Oxford 100, launched in Spring 1975 for (all prices exclude VAT); and essentially the same as the GPA. Both the Gillette GPA and Oxford 100 models used 8 digit displays with red light-emitting diodes (LEDs), 4 functions, 9 volt PP3 batteries, and measured . Models All the Oxford models were similar in appearance; the 150 was introduced in 1975 introducing the ability to calculate percentages and square roots. The Oxford 200 included memory and sold for ¬£19.95. The Oxford 300 was a scientific model with a limited number of functions (such as sin, cos, tan), which sold for ¬£29.95, much lower than the competition. The last two models, the Oxford Scientific (1976) and Oxford Universal were the most advanced of the range. The high power consumption of the calculators, which drew 40 mA while in operation, four times the recommended limit of the batteries, meant a short battery life. Computer Digest recommended using a much larger PP3 battery, but that meant losing the portability of the calculator.

It refers to a high level of overall monitoring of individual process controllers, which is not necessary for the operation of each controller, but gives the operator an overall plant process view, and allows integration of operation between controllers. A more specific use of the term is for a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system or SCADA, which refers to a specific class of system for use in process control, often on fairly small and remote applications such as a pipeline transport, water distribution, or wastewater utility system station. Forms Functional levels of a typical Distributed Control System, showing the supervisory level. Supervisory control often takes one of two forms. In one, the controlled machine or process continues autonomously. It is observed from time to time by a human who, when deeming it necessary, intervenes to modify the control algorithm in some way. In the other, the process accepts an instruction, carries it out autonomously, reports the results and awaits further commands. With manual control, the operator interacts directly with a controlled process or task using switches, levers, screws, valves etc., to control actuators. This concept was incorporated in the earliest machines which sought to extend the physical capabilities of man. In contrast, with automatic control, the machine adapts to changing circumstances and makes decisions in pursuit of some goal which can be as simple as switching a heating system on and off to maintain a room temperature within a specified range. Sheridan defines supervisory control as follows: \\"in the strictest sense, supervisory control means that one or more human operators are intermittently programming and continually receiving information from a computer that itself closes an autonomous control loop through artificial effectors to the controlled process or task environment.\\" Other points Robotics applications have traditionally aimed for automatic control. Automatic control requires sensing and responding appropriately to all combinations of circumstances which can present problems of overwhelming complexity. A supervisory control scheme offers the prospect of solving the automation problem incrementally and leaving those problems unsolved to be handled by the human supervisor. Communications delay does not have the same impact on this control scheme. All time critical feedback occurs at the slave where the delays are negligible. Instability is thus avoided without modifying the feedback loop. Communications delay, in this case, slows the rate at which an operator can assign tasks to the slave and determine whether those tasks have been successfully carried out.

Early life She was born on October 20, 1862 to a New York City Sephardic Jewish family. Her mother was Annie Augusta and her father was Robert Weeks Nathan. She came from a prominent New York City family, descended from Gershom Mendes Seixas, minister of New York's Congregation Sherith Israel during the American Revolutionary War. Nathan was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Her sister was the author and education activist Annie Nathan Meyer, the founder of Barnard College. Her cousins are the poet Emma Lazarus and Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo. Her nephew was the author and poet Robert Nathan. She and her family moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin, for four years. Maud finished her high school education there. The family moved back to New York City after the death of Maud's mother in 1878. On April 7, 1880, seventeen-year-old Maud Nathan married her first cousin Frederick Nathan.  Career  As a young married woman, Nathan became involved in charity work. She was named director at both the Mount Sinai Hospital and the Hebrew Free School. Along with Josephine Shaw Lowell, Nathan was a founding member of the New York Consumer's League. The group supported an eight-hour workday for women and children and supported the Working Women's Society in publicizing shops which treated workers fairly. The death of her daughter, Annette Florance Nathan, at the age of 8 in 1895 brought out a change in Nathan. Josephine Shaw Lowell, founder of the New York Consumers League suggested that Nathan work up an interest in the issues of working women in New York City, as a way to get over the loss of her child. This was the initial start of Nathan's career in helping women.http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/nathan- maud Jewish Women's Archive In 1897, Nathan became president of the New York Consumer's League. When the National Consumer's League was created in 1898, Nathan become a member of its Executive Committee. In 1901, the Consumer League of Rhode Island was organized after Maud Nathan gave a speech in the state. Maud Nathan (1912) Lobbying Albany on consumer issues made Nathan realize how little legislators cared about the opinions of vote-less women and so Nathan became more involved in suffrage activities. In 1908, Nathan published a pamphlet entitled The Wage Earner and the Ballot which pointed out that in suffrage states the age of consent was higher, the illiteracy rate was lower, women were paid more for civil service jobs, and there were stronger child labor laws.

Thiamine is a key chemical in glucose metabolism that, when deficient, is most threatening to neurological activity. In addition to altered thiamine status, an association with high sulfur intake has been observed as a potential cause of PEM. Other toxic or metabolic diseases (eg, acute lead poisoning, sodium toxicosis/water deprivation) can result in PEM as well. Cattle, sheep, goat, and other ruminants that are diagnosed with PEM or pre-PEM suffer opisthotonus, cortical blindness, disoriented movement, and eventually fatality, if left untreated. Current data shows that the onset of PEM can range from birth to late adulthood.  Causes  Thiamine deficiency Thiamine availability is controlled by the direct dietary consumption of thiamine. Thiamine availability is also regulated by thiaminases, which are enzymes that readily cleave thiamine molecules and inhibit essential thiamine-regulated pathways such as the metabolism of glucose. Ruminants have working rumen microbes that synthesize thiamine molecules for the body; therefore, ruminants do not need to ingest thiamine rich foods for thiamine. However, feed concentrates given to ruminants, specifically sheep and cattle, are often heavily stocked with thiaminases. The presence of thiaminases counter the production of thiamine by breaking them down, resulting in a futile cycle between rumen microbes and thiaminases. Eventually, when the rate of synthesis production can not exceed thiaminase intake, a state of thiamine deficiency will be reached. Thiaminase rich foods include different grains, fresh water fish, and ferns, all of which are often processed together to make feed concentrate. Overconsumption of glucose Since glucose metabolism is regulated by thiamine, the overconsumption of glucose can also result in thiamine inadequacy. When there is a sudden increase of glucose in the body, thiamine will be depleted so that thiamine is not available when the next round of glucose needs to be metabolized. High sulfur intake In light of recent research, high concentrations of sulfur intake have also been deemed responsible for PEM. Sulfur is necessary for the synthesis of important sulfur-containing amino acids and their contribution to the synthesis of different hormones, enzymes, and structural proteins. The ruminant diet, especially that of cattle, can be overly concentrated with sulfur. In ruminants, the same rumen microbes that generate thiamine molecules reduce sulfur into toxic sulfides. Among the sulfide toxins is hydrogen sulfide, a gas compound that will compete with oxygen to bind with red blood cells and eventually enter the brain to disrupt neural activity. Clinical symptoms Clinical signs of PEM are variable depending on the area of the cerebral cortex affected and may include head pressing, dullness, opisthotonos, central blindness, anorexia, muscle tremors, teeth grinding, trismus, salivation, drooling, convulsions, nystagmus, clonic convulsions, and recumbency. Early administration of thiamine may be curative, but if the lesion is more advanced, then surviving animals may remain partially blind and mentally dull.

Early life Ellis was born in Pant, Rhosllannerchrugog, Denbighshire and was educated at Ruabon Grammar School. He entered the mining industry, and in 1957 was appointed manager of the nearby Bersham Colliery.Review of After the Dust Has Settled: The Autobiography of Tom Ellis (Gwales.com) He took further studies at the University of Wales and the University of Nottingham. He was a president of Wrexham Fabian Society. Parliamentary career Ellis first stood for Parliament without success in Flint West in 1966. Elected at the 1970 general election as Labour MP for Wrexham, he was re-elected in the February 1974, October 1974, and May 1979 elections. He also served as an indirectly elected Member of the European Parliament from 1975‚Äì1979. Ellis had grown increasingly disaffected with the leftward direction of the Labour Party by the beginning of the 1980s. He was one of the core handful of Jenkinsite Labour MPs who were prepared to leave the Labour Party without the Gang of Three of David Owen, Bill Rodgers, and Shirley Williams. In fact, he had even gone so far as seriously to contemplate joining the Liberals. Ellis' disenchantment with the Labour Party was so great that he probably voted for Michael Foot over Denis Healey in Labour's 1980 leadership election in order to accelerate the disintegration of the Labour Party. In 1981, Ellis became one of the founding members of the SDP. Ellis was one of three Welsh MPs to join the new party (the others were Jeffrey Thomas and Ednyfed Hudson Davies) and he was elected to serve as the President of Welsh Social Democrats. As a result of boundary changes, Ellis did not contest Wrexham in 1983 election, instead he stood in the new constituency of Clwyd South West which incorporated much of his old constituency. Ellis finished second to the Conservative candidate Robert Harvey by 1,551 votes in a competitive three-way race.

Biography The initial line up was: Evelyn Downing (voice and flute) Jamie Field (guitar and bass) and Andrew Garman (keyboard, bass, and drums). In the beginning the band was envisaged purely as a studio project, and in June 2003 they released a 14 track debut album, The Mermaid Kiss Album, and following many requests they made their live debut on 21 December 2003, at The Rock Cafe 2000, Stourbridge supporting Karnataka. In September 2004, Downing left Kington to further her studies at University in Manchester, and two guest vocalists, Kate Belcher and Kate Emerson, were recruited by Field and Garman. Guitarist Nigel Hooton also joined the band at this time. The band's second release in February 2006, a 7 track EP entitled Salt On Skin, contained songs featuring vocals by both Downing, Belcher, and Emerson. The artwork and photography for the CD was by Chris Walkden. One of the songs on the EP, \\"The Blushing Bride\\", featured guitar work of Panic Room (and former Karnataka) guitarist, Paul Davies. A second album, Etarlis, was released on 18 June 2007. Etarlis was described by the band as a series of musical illustrations of the fantasy story of the same name, written by Field and Downing over the past years. The album's eleven tracks were written and arranged by Field and Garman. Kate Belcher once again featured as a guest vocalist on this album, in addition to which a range of woodwind instruments were played by Wendy Marks. Further guest appearances from Troy Donockley (Iona) on uilleann pipes and Jonathan Edwards (Panic Room and ex Karnataka) on keyboards were also featured. Following her contribution to Etarlis, Wendy Marks joined the band as a full member in 2008. Garman and Hooton subsequently departed the band, and the new line-up was augmented by Colin Henney (keyboards), Peter West (bass), and Steve White (drums). With this lineup the band released their third full-length album, 'Another Country', in 2012. Shortly after the release of 'Another Country' Downing departed the band and was replaced by Maria Milewska. The band subsequently dissolved in 2013, with Field, Marks, and Milewska forming new band Zero She Flies with keyboardist Jeremy Robberechts and bassist Shane Webb.

The price was very low for a complete computer system at the time, and Science of Cambridge eventually sold over fifteen thousand kits. History In 1977, Ian Williamson approached Clive Sinclair and Chris Curry with a computer design based around the National Semiconductor SC/MP processor. Sinclair and Curry both liked the idea and saw the potential of making a low cost microprocessor system available to the hobbyist market. Initially it was planned to market a kit based on the Williamson design. However, after National Semiconductor had been contacted regarding a bulk purchase of the SC/MP processor Sinclair and Curry decided to use the chip manufacturer's own design. This design used all National Semiconductor chips and the company allowed the use of its design for free. To keep costs low a membrane keypad was used. The size of the initial batch was two thousand. The company sold between fifteen and fifty thousand in total. Specification The computer is based around National Semiconductor's SC/MP CPU (INS8060) and shipped with 256 bytes of random access memory (RAM) as standard. It used an eight or nine red light-emitting diode (LED) seven segment display, there was also optional VDU supporting 32√ó16 text or 64√ó64 graphics. Input and output was a 20-key keyboard and reset switch. Cassette- based and PROM storage were optional extras; a sound card was not included but a design for one was provided. The on-board RAM could be increased in two ways; by the addition of an INS8154N RAM/IO chip providing an additional 128 bytes of RAM along with 16 I/O lines, and also a further 256 bytes by adding two 256 √ó 4 bit RAM chips giving a maximum of 640 bytes on board. These memory spaces were not contiguous in the memory map. It was possible to connect off- board RAM giving a 2170 bytes total. The MK14 could address up to 64 KB of memory space by adding a few chips (the NADS address strobe indicated when the most significant four bits of address were available to be captured by an external latch); many pioneering homebrew computer magazines such as Personal Computer World, and Practical Electronics carried details of user modifications.

Along with Ivan the Fool, Ivan Tsarevich is a placeholder name rather than a certain character. Tsarevich is a title given to the sons of tsars. He is often, but not always, the youngest son of three. In the tale \\"The Three Tsardoms\\", he is a son of Nastasya the Golden Braid. Different legends describe Ivan as having various wives, including Yelena the Beautiful, Vasilisa the Wise and Marya Morevna. Ivan is sometimes depicted with magic abilities and has the Sword Kladenets. Ivan is the main hero of Russian folktales. He is almost always portrayed as either the third son of a peasant family or the third son of a king. In the latter stories, he is called Ivan Tsarevich, which means \\"tsar's son.\\" Ivan is one of the most common Russian names. The friends and foes of Ivan Tsarevich are often mythic figures, from magical animals to deathless beings. The most famous folktale featuring Ivan as the protagonist is \\"Tsarevitch Ivan, the Firebird and the Gray Wolf\\". In this story, Ivan was aided by a magical wolf as he captured the firebird and won the hand of a beautiful tsarina. The firebird inspired Igor Stravinsky's ballet of the same name. In another famous tale, part of which was also used by Stravinsky in The Firebird, Ivan Tsarevich married a warrior princess, Maria Morevna, who was kidnapped by the immortal being called Koschei the Deathless. In this tale, the animal helpers were a lion, a bird and a magical horse that belonged to Baba Yaga. It was on this horse that Ivan defeated Koschei. Ivan the peasant's son has as many tales as Ivan Tsarevich. One of the best known is the story \\"the Little Humbacked Horse\\", in which a magical, talking horse helped Ivan to become a hero and marry the princess he loved. Tales about Ivan Tsarevich include \\"Ivan Tsarevich and the Grey Wolf\\", \\"Tsarevna the Frog\\", \\"The Sea Tsar and Vasilisa the Wise\\", \\"The Tale about Rejuvenating Apples and the Life Water\\", and \\"The Death of Koschei the Immortal (also known as \\"Marya Morevna\\").\\"  References  Category:Russian folklore characters Category:Fictional princes Category:Fairy tale stock characters Category:Russian folklore Category:Fictional characters who use magic Category:Heroes in mythology and legend ","title":"Ivan Tsarevich"},{"id":"4521906","text":"A League of Ordinary Gentlemen is a documentary film about ten-pin bowling that was released on DVD on March 21, 2006.

The group performs at venues throughout Brisbane including New Farm Park, Queen Street Mall, South Bank Parklands and the Old Museum Building. QWAB rehearses in the Old Museum Building. Queensland Wind and Brass was formed in December 1989 and arose from a need for a high standard musical group for post-secondary musicians. Since its inception, Queensland Wind and Brass has grown rapidly. In 1991, the group was the highest awarded concert band in the Queensland Festival of Music, Community Ensemble Section. In 1992 and again in 1999, Queensland Wind and Brass was the overall winner of this section where it was awarded the Most Outstanding Performance trophy. In 2001, QWAB came third in the A Grade National Band Competition and first in the A Grade Festival of Music. In 2005, 2006 and 2007 it was the highest awarded Wind Ensemble in the Brisbane City Council's ‚ÄúBattle of the Bands‚Äù. The group consists of both amateur and professional woodwind, brass and percussion players, aged from 17 years upwards. New members are always welcome! Rehearsals currently take place on Tuesday evenings from 7:00pm in the Main Concert Hall of The Old Museum, Bowen Hills.

On October 16, 2017, WDCD went silent for the final time.F.C.C.‚Äôs list of silent A.M. stations, as of May 3, 2018; retrieved May 23, 2018. The station surrendered its license to the FCC on September 28, 2018. History WDCD signed on August 10, 1948 as WPTR, with 10,000 watts of power from its current location in Colonie. The call letters were requested as such to reflect the original licensee, Patroon Broadcasting Company, which was owned by Schine Chain Theatres. The studios were located in the Hotel Ten Eyck in Albany. In 1953, the station gained the ABC Radio affiliation from exiting WXKW, and primarily programmed a mix of popular and country music along with news & sports. It was during this period that 1540 increased power to 50,000 watts full-time to combat nighttime interference from co-channel stations KXEL in Waterloo, Iowa and ZNS-1 in Nassau, Bahamas (although the official explanation to the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] was the \\"poor ground conductivity\\" at the transmitter site). WPTR also had a partnership with a local FM station (W47A/WBCA, the first independent FM radio station in the United States) to produce pre-recorded programming in WBCA's state-of-the-art Schenectady studios. On September 16, 1953, American Airlines Flight 723 flew between the northeast and center towers of the station's 3 tower array. The plane was cleared for a contact approach to Albany Airport's Runway 10. On final approach, while still miles west of the airport, the Convair descended too low, and, at an altitude of , struck two of the set of three -tall radio masts arrayed northeast to southwest. The right wing struck the center tower of the three, then the left wing struck the northeast tower. Seven feet of the outer panel of the right wing including the right aileron and control mechanism from the center hinge outboard together with 15 feet of the left outer wing panel and aileron separated from the aircraft. Ground impact occurred beyond the northeast tower. At this point, the aircraft had rolled to a partially inverted attitude. The nose and left wing struck the ground first. The rest of the airplane fell to earth in short order and caught fire. The aircraft narrowly missed hitting a trailer park on the Albany-Schenectady road. All 28 occupants on board (25 passengers, 2 pilots, and a flight attendant) were killed. The aircraft crashed just north of Central Avenue (NY Route 5).Record 19530916-0 at Aviation Safety Net To date, this is the worst aviation accident in the Albany area. By 1957, in an effort to become more competitive with the more established stations in the region, a new \\"Top 40\\" format was introduced to Capital District listeners. WTRY also had top 40 programs at the time, but did not devote the entire broadcast day to it. Popular hosts on WPTR included Boom Boom Brannigan, Charlie Brown, and Bob Badger. Brannigan would stay with the station until 1974. The popular rock-and-roll format had a loyal following among listeners both locally, and throughout the northeastern United States, as well as a good portion of eastern and Maritime Canada. In fact, WPTR had a stronger skywave signal in the western Boston suburbs than Boston's own top 40 station, WMEX. By the early 1960s, WTRY had switched to top 40 music programming full-time, and a ratings war of sorts began between the two stations that lasted well into the 1970s. For much of its top 40 heyday, WPTR was the number-one rated station in the Capital District. In 1960, the studios were moved to the more prominent 1820 Central Avenue location in Colonie, where they remained until a fire severely damaged the interior of the building in 1964. A new broadcast facility was constructed at the transmitter site, and programming originated from what became known as the 'Gold studios' until 2005 when the building was demolished. Programming now originates from new digital facilities inside the transmitter building. With FM stations becoming increasingly popular with younger listeners, WPTR's ratings entered a steady decline in the mid-1970s, and in 1980 the station's owner, Rust Communications (which also owned WFLY, an FM station that had adopted a top 40 format a year earlier) finally submitted and flipped WPTR to country music in 1980 with veteran jock J.W. Wagner at the helm during morning drive. The station regained some popularity, and when ownership did some improvements (including adding AM Stereo), the station stayed relatively successful. However, competition from FM rival WGNA led WPTR to leave the format in 1988, subsequently trying different talk, sports, and news formats with meager results each time. In 1995, Albany Broadcasting sold WPTR to Crawford Broadcasting, with the sale closing that September. WDCD logo until 2011Upon taking over, Crawford changed the call sign to WDCD, in honor of founder Don Crawford. (Albany Broadcasting reclaimed the WPTR calls the following March, on the former WCDA.) The format was changed to contemporary Christian music and related Christian programming. In 2000, the company brought its secular \\"Legends\\" adult standards music format to the station, along with the classic WPTR call letters and Boom Boom Brannigan as morning host; WDCD's religious programming was continued at 96.7 FM, which had simulcast AM 1540 since May 1996. The \\"Legends\\" format was a ratings success (putting WPTR back in the top 10 for the first time in 15 years), but a financial pitfall. The situation was greatly complicated when WKLI-FM entered the nostalgia format in November 2001. In 2004, WPTR and WDCD swapped formats and call letters, returning AM 1540 to Christian programming. Several months later, WPTR at the 96.7 FM frequency dropped \\"Legends\\" for contemporary Christian music, but flipped to oldies in 2011 due to increased competition from K-LOVE and Air 1, and later began simulcasting WDCD again the same year. WDCD began broadcasting in HD digital radio in 2006, the second AM station in the area to do so. Recently, WDCD had not been broadcasting in HD Radio, and also signed off between 9-10 every night. WDCD temporarily left the air on April 1, 2012 to make plans for a new format. WDCD was shut down on October 16, 2017. On September 28, 2018, DJRA surrendered the license to the FCC for cancellation.

He was born in Findlay, Ohio. In the early part of his career, Ricketts undertook research at Northwestern University on blastomycosis. He later worked in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana and at the University of Chicago on Rocky Mountain spotted fever. This early pathology, entomology and epidemiology research in Hamilton, Montana lead to the eventual formation of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory there. While in Montana, Ricketts and his assistant discovered that the vector that carried the pathogen for Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick, the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni; some other species of ticks, such as the American dog or wood tick, Dermacentor variabilis, also are vectors). It was not at once clear what kind of organism the pathogen was; eventually it was named Rickettsia, the first of the Rickettsiales to be identified. However, for decades, until electron microscopy and other technologies became sufficiently advanced, it was not known whether Rickettsiales were bacteria, viruses, or something in between. They now are known to be bacteria specialised for intracellular parasitism. Ricketts was devoted to his research and, on several occasions, injected himself with pathogens to study their effects. The pathogen causing Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Rickettsia rickettsii was named after him. After this eponymous genus, the larger family and order were given their names. In 1910, Ricketts became interested in a strain of murine-carried typhus known as tabardillo due to a major outbreak in Mexico City, and the apparent similarity of the disease to spotted fever. Days after isolating the organism that he believed caused typhus, he himself died of the disease. Ricketts was survived by his wife, Myra Tubbs Ricketts, and children. His family established an annual student research prize, the Howard Taylor Ricketts Prize, at the University of Chicago in 1912.

The provincial and district capital, it is 137 kilometres by road southeast of Hat Yai. The eastern part of the city is part of the neighboring tambon of Sateng Nok. As of 2019 the tambon had a total population of 60,617. It lies on the border with Pattani Province in the north of Yala Province. It lies on Thailand Route 4106, south of Khao Tum and north of Krong Pinang. Yala railway station is on the State Railway of Thailand Southern Line. Yala is approximately 1,100 km south of Bangkok. History Yala used to be part of the Pattani kingdom. When Ayutthaya was captured by the Burmese, Yala, along with other southern colonies, became independent. Yala was again included as part of Thailand about 41 years later. In September 1977, the King and Queen of Thailand narrowly avoided assassination after a bomb exploded nearby during a visit. On 9 October, policemen from the 12th Provincial Police Headquarters and the Yala Provincial Police Headquarters arrested Abdun Romae Haron, Mae Prachu, and Choning Saing on charges of conspiring with the escaped convicts Hayi Masae, Choya Samae, and Abdun Romae in attempting to kill the monarchs. Landmarks On the river The city surrounds around a circular park and is meticulously laid out, centered along Phang Mueang, the central thoroughfare. There is a large park to the west of this with a lake and swamp. The city contains a pillar shrine, Yala Central Mosque, and a field hospital. Yala Central Mosque is a large mosque with a square shaped roof and green dome, on the main road towards the north of the city. It has existed in its location for over a century and was damaged during the Japanese occupation of Thailand, but was subsequently rebuilt after World War II. Yala Hospital and Siroros Hospital, on Route 4106, serve the surrounding district. The Tham Phab Khien Fa Panang caves lie to the east of Yala on the way to Budi and contain 500-year-old rock paintings. Economy The main occupations of the people are trade, agriculture, business, and governmental services, given that it is the capital of Mueang Yala District and contains district offices. Secondary industry also has some significance, given that the city contains the Muang Yala municipal slaughterhouse in the western part of the city near the river bank, the Shaapan rubber factory, Sun Thai Yala Co.

He was known for his success from the late 1970s to the end of the 1980s. Webb is one of only 16 players in history to win at least 20 PBA Tour titles, and is a member of both the PBA and USBC Halls of Fame.Vint, Bill. \\"PBA Stars Ballard, Webb, Richgels Inducted into United States Bowling Congress Hall of Fame.\\" Article at www.pba.com on July 2, 2011. PBA Career The son of a bowling center operator, Webb knew from age twelve that \\"all I ever wanted to be was a professional bowler.\\" He was eighteen when he got his wish and joined the PBA (Professional Bowlers Association) tour in 1975. He found success quickly, winning his first tournament at age 21 and earning \\"Player of the Year\\" honors by age 23. On November 2, 1982, Webb won the Columbia 300 Open in Sterling Heights, Michigan to become the youngest player in PBA history (25 years, 90 days) to reach ten career PBA titles. That feat would be bested by just one day when Mike Aulby won his tenth title in 1985 at age 25 years, 89 days. Webb remains the third-youngest player to reach ten titles as of 2019, behind Pete Weber (24 years, 247 days) and Aulby. Webb was one of the PBA's first 10 career \\"millionaires.\\" Webb captured 20 career PBA titles, including his lone major championship at the 1980 PBA Tournament of Champions. He was named PBA Player of the Year in 1980, the only player not named Earl Anthony or Mark Roth to win that award in an 11-season stretch (1974-1984). He became a member of the PBA Hall of Fame in 1993. His 20th and final PBA Tour title came in 1997 at the Bud Light Championship. The 20 titles puts Webb in a 13th-place tie with fellow PBA Hall of Famers Dick Ritger, Amleto Monacelli and Tommy Jones. A panel of bowling experts selected by the PBA ranked Webb #18 on their 2008 list of \\"50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years.\\" From 2000 on, Webb had major personal and professional problems, including suffering through a gambling addiction and his third divorce, and his bowling career began a steady decline. After being eliminated in the 2005 Denny's World Championship, Webb quit the PBA Tour and professional bowling as a whole. Webb's appearance in the Ten-pin movie/documentary A League of Ordinary Gentlemen documents this time and features Webb's candid comments on this period of his life.Independent Lens recap of A League of Ordinary Gentlemen at www.pbs.org Webb also continues to bowl in local and regional tournaments, on the PBA Senior Tour (now known as the PBA50 Tour) and in selected events on the PBA Tour. He bowled at the PBA 2008 H&R; Block Tournament of Champions along with several other past TOC winners who were invited. On June 20, 2008, Wayne Webb won the 2008 Senior U.S. Open, defeating Johnny Petraglia 204-172 in the championship match. This was only his second ever Senior Tour event. Webb was named 2008 PBA Senior Rookie of the Year. On winning this award, he commented: \\"Obviously it's a great honor. Being on the Tour for 30 years, quitting for three years, and then coming back on the Senior Tour this year and doing as well as I did, it kind of re-sparked my life with bowling again.\\" Webb repeated as Senior U.S. Open Champion in 2009.Schneider, Jerry. \\"Wayne Webb Goes for Third Straight PBA Senior U.S. Open Title June 6‚Äì11 in Las Vegas.\\" Article at www.pba.com on June 1, 2010.

The Croydon Inclosure Map of 1800 shows an area \\"Woodside Green\\". In 1871, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners granted 'copyhold' to the Croydon Local Board of Health upon condition that it should be appropriated by the Board: ::\\"to be forever kept as an open space and used as, and for, a place of recreation for the use of inhabitants of the parish of Croydon and of the neighbourhood and for no other purpose\\". Four months later, the Commissioners, passed the freehold of the land to the board \\"freed from all incidents whatsoever of copyhold or customary tenure to be held and used for the purpose of public walks, recreation or pleasure grounds only\\". The area has been used by the Local Board of Health and its successors ever since. In 1888, the Borough of Croydon acquired the neighbouring Poplar Farm and subsequently, part of the farm was included in the grounds of the green. The green features mature plane trees with benches beneath them. Beside the roadway which bisects the green is a stone horse- and cattle-trough. Although no longer used in respect of livestock, it is still a feature of the green.

Written and produced by Impressions lead singer Curtis Mayfield, the song is notable as one of the most prominent popular recordings dealing with the subject of black pride. The phrase \\"We're a Winner\\" was later used as the motto of Mayfield's record label Curtom Records. Background The concept for \\"We're a Winner\\" came to Curtis Mayfield one night in a dream; the musician quickly woke himself and ran with his inspiration. The resulting song was an uplifting composition whose lyrics encouraged the listener that the time for self-pity is over, and that one should acknowledge his or her worth, even in the face of opposition. Intended as an inspirational song for the group's primarily African-American audiences, Mayfield urges his audience to \\"Keep on pushin'/like your leaders tell you to\\" - the \\"leaders\\" being figures involved in the Civil Rights Movement such as Martin Luther King Jr., Stokely Carmichael, and others. To accentuate the song's uplifting feel, \\"We're a Winner\\" was recorded with a live audience in the RCA Victor and Universal studios in the Impressions' homebase of Chicago, Illinois. Although the Impressions had previously released inspiration singles such as \\"People Get Ready\\", \\"Keep on Pushing\\", and \\"Amen\\", those songs were more general and often more directly rooted in gospel music than \\"We're a Winner\\". Only a few other previous singles by other mainstream popular artists - most notably Sam Cooke's posthumous release \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" - had attempted to directly address racial politics in America. \\"We're a Winner\\", included on a 1968 Impressions LP of the same name, became a virtual anthem for the Civil Rights Movement, and its success resulted not only in similar follow-ups from the Impressions (among them \\"Choice of Colors\\" and \\"This is My Country\\"), but also marked the beginning of a trend towards increasing social consciousness in soul music. During and after \\"We're a Winner's\\" chart run in 1968, several other acts, including James Brown (\\"Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud\\") and Sly & the Family Stone (\\"Everyday People\\") were releasing successful hits which directly addressed racial issues and black pride.

As a writer, almost from the beginning, he was fascinated by a curious genre that he helped invent: the com√©die polici√®re or comedy thriller, of which Eight Women is an example. In 1960, Thomas had a hit with Man Trap, a humorous murder mystery which was an overnight success in Paris. Alfred Hitchcock bought the rights and the play established Thomas as a writer of psychological crime dramas with a distinctively Gallic comic twist. The following year the second outing of Eight Women was far more successful as it won the Hachette Prix du Quai des Orfevres for Best Play in 1961. Thomas was a prolific actor, playwright and movie director. If he is best known for Eight Women it is probably because it was adapted into a movie musical by Fran√ßois Ozon in 2002 with a star-studded line-up that included Catherine Deneuve, Fanny Ardant and Emmanuelle B√©art. Thomas‚Äôs plays were never fashionable and he was often dismissed by French critics but he was a popular dramatist. By the time he was 18, he claimed he had read every play published in French since 1900. Thomas died in 1989 in Paris.

The Bojay√° massacre occurred in the original Bellavista on May 2, 2002. An essentially new town was constructed, on a hill to avoid flooding, one kilometer upriver from the original Bellavista in 2003, and inaugurated in 2007. Whereby the original Bellavista was renamed to Bellavista Viejo (Old Bellavista in Spanish), and the new town Bellavista Nuevo (New Bellavista). Bellavista Viejo is currently completely abandoned.  Bojaya municipality  The Bojaya municipality, according to a 2005 census, has 9941 inhabitants. 58.4% of the population of the municipality is afro-colombian, and 41.4% and indigenous Embera. 95.86% of the population do not have their basic needs met. The municipality contains part of the Utr√≠a National Natural Park. There is still paramilitary and presence of the ELN in the region, tensions and violence between the groups are still threatening the population in the region.  Bellavista Nuevo  Half of the inhabitants of the Bojay√° region live in the municipal centre, Bellavista. After the massacre, only a part of the population remained or returned to the region. The remains of the victims of the massacre are buried in the new town, a mausoleum has also been built in their memory.  Relocation  The new town one kilometer south of the original position. was built after the Bojay√° massacre by the Colombian government. The relocation of Bellavista was announced on May 7, 2002, 5 days after the massacre by president Andr√©s Pastrana who visited the region after the massacre. The main reason for the relocation, namely the frequent flooding of the town, is a reality not exclusive to Bellavista, but rather common to the region. The majority of the town was in favour of a relocation, but the town was torn on the issue. The university Universidad Javeriana in Bogot√° was put in charge of the design of the new town. The 265 houses were build of concrete, exceptional in the region, and provided with, among other services, a water installation and electricity.  Bellavista Viejo  The old town, Bellavista Viejo, is currently completely abandoned. The old San Pablo Ap√≥stol church has been restored after the massacre in 2002, and is being maintained in memory of the tragic event. Every year, on the second of May, a memorial is held in the church. During this service, the statue of Christ mutilated in the massacre, el Christo Mutilado de Bojaya, is brought in a procession by river, from the new church in Bellavista Nuevo to Bellavista Viejo.

He taught that the highest virtue was filial piety (k≈ç), and acted upon this, giving up his official post in 1634 in order to return to his home in Takashima, ≈åmi to care of his mother. He distinguished, however, between sho- k≈ç and dai-k≈ç: lesser and greater filial piety. Sho-k≈ç involves the normal care owed by children to their parents; dai-k≈ç involves the notion that our human parents are themselves the children of the divine parents -- thus, if one's parents are wrong, then one should encourage them to return to virtue. He was unusual in believing that his teaching would be useful to women as well as men. While accepting the then standard view of women as usually lacking such virtues as compassion and honesty, he argued: \\"if a wife's disposition is healthy and pious, obedient, sympathetic and honest, then ... every member of her family will be at peace and the entire household in perfect order.\\"Bodart- Bailey, Beatrice.

Nakae originally followed the teachings of the Chinese neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi, but eventually became more influenced by Wang Yangming (1472‚Äì1529), who argued for the primacy of human intuition or conscience over intellect: moral improvement arises out of conscience-based action (compare Aristotle's ethics). Nakae added a more religious aspect to Wang's \\"School of Intuition of Mind\\", calling the human conscience the \\"divine light of heaven\\". Nakae's works also supplied his followers (such as Kumazawa Banzan [1619‚Äì1691]) with \\"the moral foundation for political action\\".Bodart-Bailey, p. 741.

A right-handed middle order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler, Bainbridge was a member of the Gloucestershire team throughout the 1980s, batting at number 5 or 6, and bowling medium pace seamers. Bainbridge came into the Gloucestershire side in 1977, and won a regular place in 1981. In that season, he passed 1,000 runs for the first time at an average of over 40 runs per innings and made the first of what would be 24 first-class centuries. He passed 1,000 runs in each of the next three seasons, but in 1985, he was moved up the batting order to No 4 and his batting moved up a notch. He made 1,644 runs at an average of more than 56 runs per innings as Gloucestershire rose from the bottom of the County Championship table to challenge for the title. Bainbridge was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1986, but he had a less successful season and talk of him as a potential Test player subsided. After four more years, Bainbridge retired from Gloucestershire after the 1990 season to go into business, and became involved in the marketing side of the development of Durham as a first-class county. Having missed the entire 1991 season, he played in most of Durham's first-class games in their two inaugural seasons and he topped both batting and bowling averages in 1993. He was then made captain for 1994, and the side finished 16th, the first time it had not been bottom in the County Championship. But Bainbridge's own form suffered, and he was replaced as captain for 1995 and retired finally from first-class cricket the following year.

Their early compositional techniques exploited the sound synthesis methods and nuances of the machines themselves and did not use their abilities as sequencers for external hardware devices. Team Doyobi's early sound combined simple synth leads and basslines with funk, r'n'b or soul-like rhythms, overall rendering a stripped-down funky sound. Their early releases were entirely created using Commodore sound chips with no use of MIDI, synthesizers or other musical hardware. Although the technology they use has changed over recent years, their considered approach to the nuances and peculiarities of individual pieces of technology has remained consistent.

The show's aim was to revive the genuine variety shows from the past, such as The Ed Sullivan Show, where, as Penn put it, you could see Pavarotti singing an aria, followed by a man with trained performing housecats. Description Sin City Spectacular was an hour-long program that featured many acts on the program that were bizarre, sideshow-type performances. These type of performances included Katzen, the tattooed lady who ate bugs, and her husband, the Enigma (also covered with tattoos), who swallowed swords and lightbulbs, and had two horns surgically implanted into his forehead. Often celebrities appeared performing previously unknown talents, such as actor French Stewart singing and dancing Hooray Pornography, Andy Dick tap-dancing, or Jerry Springer singing while the dancers fight behind him a la The Jerry Springer Show. Musical highlights were Fred, an old- time barbershop quartet, singing \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\"; Michael McKean as a distraught Edgar Allan Poe who breaks into a disco extravaganza with the Eight Deadly Sin Dancers', and comedian Carlos Alazraqui transforming the tradition of Irish River Dancing into a bizarre S&M; spanking fantasywhich were the brainchild of writer Martin Olson. Outstanding straight musical acts like Dr. John and John Popper also appeared. In one performance, Popper jammed on the harmonica while Penn narrated a story and Teller illustrated it with card tricks. Other performers included comedians Kevin Meaney, Don Novello, Otto and George, Bobcat Goldthwait, Eric Idle, and Martin Mull. Each show opened with a solo Penn and Teller performance. Some of their pieces, like \\"Cuffed to a Creep\\" where Penn finds himself handcuffed to a bizarre stranger (Teller) on a park bench, and \\"Balloon of Blood\\" in which Penn eloquently describes the strength and vulnerability of humanity, were borrowed from their stage show, while others, like Teller's \\"zippo lighter\\" piece, were written especially for the TV show. The FX network chose not to renew the show after the first season. Crew *Bruce Gowers, Kent Weed, Ron de Moraes, Directors *Michael L.

It was patented in 1960 and approved for medical use in 1962. Medical uses Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant Œ≤-lactam. It is similar to methicillin, and has replaced methicillin in clinical use. Other related compounds are nafcillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin. Since it is resistant to penicillinase enzymes, such as that produced by Staphylococcus aureus, it is widely used clinically in the US to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, with the introduction and widespread use of both oxacillin and methicillin, antibiotic-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/ORSA) have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. MRSA/ORSA can be treated with vancomycin or other new antibiotics. Contraindications The use of oxacillin is contraindicated in individuals that have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to any medication in the penicillin family of antibiotics.Drugs.com: Bactocill Cross- allergenicity has been documented in individuals taking oxacillin that experienced a previous hypersensitivity reaction when given cephalosporins and cephamycins.Apothecon. Oxacillin sodium for injection for intramuscular or intravenous injection prescribing information. Princeton, NJ; 2001 Jan. Adverse effects Commonly reported adverse effects associated with the use of oxacillin include skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, acute interstitial nephritis, and fever. High doses of oxacillin have been reported to cause renal, hepatic, and nervous system toxicity. Common to all members of the penicillin class of drugs, oxacillin may cause acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. As an injection, oxacillin may cause injection site reactions, which may be characterized by redness, swelling, and itching. Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Oxacillin, through its Œ≤-lactam ring, covalently binds to penicillin-binding proteins, which are enzymes involved in the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This binding interaction interferes with the transpeptidation reaction and inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a prominent component of the cell wall. By decreasing the integrity of the bacterial cell wall, it is thought that oxacillin and other penicillins kill actively growing bacteria through cell autolysis. Chemistry As with other members of the penicillin family, the chemical structure of oxacillin features a 6-aminopenicillanic acid nucleus with a substituent attached to the amino group. The 6-aminopenicillanic acid nucleus consists of a thiazolidine ring attached to a Œ≤-lactam ring, which is the active moiety responsible for the antibacterial activity of the penicillin family. The substituent present on oxacillin is thought to impart resistance to degradation via bacterial Œ≤-lactamases. History Oxacillin, a derivative of methicillin, was first synthesized in the early 1960s as part of a research initiative led by Peter Doyle and John Naylor of Beecham, in consort with Bristol-Myers. Members of the isoxazolyl penicillin family, which includes cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and oxacillin, were synthesized to counter the increasing prevalence of infections caused by penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. While methicillin could only be administered via injection, the isoxazolyl penicillins, including oxacillin, could be given orally or by injection. Following the synthesis of cloxacillin and oxacillin, Beecham retained the right to commercially develop cloxacillin in the United Kingdom while Bristol-Myers was given the marketing rights for oxacillin in the United States.

The band's discography includes many full-length albums spanning nearly three decades, through Cleopatra Records and other labels. History Bari-Bari's signature songwriting style and distinctive wall of chorus/delay-effected guitar sound makes Mephisto Walz instantly identifiable amongst other pioneers of deathrock. Mephisto Walz was formed in 1986 by Barry Galvin (aka Bari-Bari) and John Schuman (Johann), following their departure from the influential deathrock band Christian Death. Bari-Bari had joined Christian Death as bassist while the iconic Rozz Williams was still vocalist (Williams left the band in 1985, with guitarist Valor Kand becoming its lead singer and principal songwriter). Christian Death's 1985 album \\"Atrocities\\" and the EPs \\"The Wind Kissed Pictures\\" and \\"Believers of the Unpure\\" featured Bari-Bari, Johann (bass), and David Glass (drums), all of whom would feature in one or more incarnation of Mephisto Walz. Following conflict with Kand, Bari-Bari and Johann departed Christian Death. The band's 1986 album \\"Atrocities\\" includes several tracks composed by Bari-Bari, notably \\"Tales of Innocence\\", \\"Strapping Me Down\\", and \\"Silent Thunder\\". Additionally, 1985's \\"The Wind Kissed Pictures\\" EP features Bari-Bari's \\"The Wind Kissed Pictures\\" and \\"Lacrima Christi\\", while the \\"Believers of the Unpure\\" single, released in ‚Äô86, includes his composition \\"Between Youth\\". The first incarnation of Mephisto Walz started in D√ºsseldorf in February 1986, with original members Bari-Bari (the band's sole songwriter), Johann, and Arndt (drums), plus a German vocalist called J√∂rge. The name Mephisto Walz was proposed by Johann. They rehearsed songs mainly written by Bari-Bari, but also added soundscapes such as ‚ÄúAboriginee Requiem‚Äù. The band's eponymous debut album was released on Italian label Supporti Fonografici that same year. In 1987 they moved to Los Angeles, without Johann. In 1988, Bari-Bari started working on tracks with Steven Grey in Hollywood at a studio where the former worked. They regrouped with David Hermon (bass), Mondo (vox) and Nariki Shimooka (guitar). Playing the first EP and some of Bari-Bari's Christian Death material they added new songs that would later be released on the ‚ÄúCrocosmia‚Äù, ‚ÄúTerra-Regina‚Äù and ‚ÄúThalia‚Äù labels. During this period, what would later become \\"Mephisto Walz Rarities 1989\\" were recorded live in studio. In 1991, Christianna was brought in as vocalist as Bari-Bari felt that male vocals were too similar to Williams and Christian Death. William Faith was added on bass at the same time. An association with Gymnastic Records was started with the compilation \\"American Gothic\\", which featured Mephisto Walz's \\"Tangia\\". ‚ÄúCrocosmia‚Äù was then recorded for European release, consisting of new tracks and some older tracks redone with Christianna on vocals. In 1992, a co-headlined tour with Shadow Project (featuring Williams and Eva O) brought Mephisto Walz back to Germany, where they stayed and recorded \\"As Apostles Forget\\". Bari-Bari also wrote part of what would be ‚ÄúTerra-Regina‚Äù and ‚ÄúThalia‚Äù, before returning to the U.S. In Los Angeles, Johann and Glass were available again and replaced Faith and Grey. Work then began with Bari-Bari and Christianna on the next three complete releases - \\"Eternal Deep\\", \\"Terra-Regina\\" and \\"Thalia\\", through new label Cleopatra Records. In 1994-1999, Bari-Bari and Christianna completed cover singles for Cleopatra, as well as \\"Early Recordings\\" and \\"Immersion\\". The recordings were made with Bari-Bari (all music) and Christianna (vocals). The \\"Nightingale\\" EP was recorded by Bari-Bari and Christianna in 2002 for the Fossil Dungeon label, followed by the album \\"Insidious\\" in 2004. For the next few years, Bari-Bari played and recorded with Scarlet's Remains and recorded bands in his L.A. studio. In 2011 \\"IIIrd Incarnation\\" was recorded with both Bari-Bari and Sara Reid on vocals. A more aggressive guitar style was reintroduced. Two years later, \\"New Apostles\\" was recorded with Bari-Bari and Myriam Galvin now on vocals. It featured Christian Omar Madrigal Izzo on four tracks. 2017's \\"Scoundrel‚Äù was written and recorded by Bari-Bari and Myriam, with Omar Madrigal Izzo again performing on select songs.

Encodings of the œÄ-calculus in the join-calculus, and vice versa, have been demonstrated., pg. 2 The join-calculus is a member of the œÄ-calculus family of process calculi, and can be considered, at its core, an asynchronous œÄ-calculus with several strong restrictions:, pg. 19 *Scope restriction, reception, and replicated reception are syntactically merged into a single construct, the definition; *Communication occurs only on defined names; *For every defined name there is exactly one replicated reception.

The road is a useful part of the route from the M1 at its junction with the M69 (M1/J21) to the A47 heading towards Peterborough and beyond, effectively \\"plugging the gap\\" in the A563 ring-road between the A6 at Oadby and the A47 at Highfields. History The section of road between Gipsy Lane and the A563 was opened in April 2005 to make it easier for traffic to get to Oadby and the A6, otherwise they would have had to use the unfinished A563 to get to Oadby. The small section of road between Red Hill Circle and the A607 still has the 'A6030' road name but the rest of the old road has been downgraded. The stretch between Red Hill Circle and Gypsy Lane was originally the A6 (Loughborough Road). The A6030 was meant to be the eastern half of the A563 at one stage. At its junction with Hastings Road, where the A6030 effectively turns off to the north, there is a strip of land as far as the railway line (which has now had a housing estate with cul- de-sacs built on it, you can still see where the road would have gone). The A6030 would then have obliterated Canon Street and Ratcliffe Street, continued West over the River Soar, lining up with Corporation Road and then Beaumont Leys Lane. This would then have curved, approximating the later line of Strasbourg Drive, to line up with the western half of the A563.

Today, the applications of business development and the business developer or marketer tasks across industries and countries, cover everything from IT- programmers, specialized engineers, advanced marketing or key account management activities, and sales and relations development for current and prospective customers. For this reason, it has been difficult to discern the unique features of the business development function and whether these activities are a source of profits. Recent systematic research on the subject has outlined the contours of an emerging business development function with a unique role in the innovation management process. The business development function seems to be more matured in high-tech, and especially the pharma and biotech, industries.Davis, C. H., & Sun, E. (2006). Business development capabilities in information technology SMEs in a regional economy: An exploratory study. The Journal of Technology Transfer, 31(1), 145-161.Kind, S., & Knyphausen-Aufse√ü, Z.

Business Development Capability: Insights from the Biotechnology Industry. Symphony. Emerging Issues in Management, (2), 1-16. Professionals The business developer is concerned with the analytical preparation of potential growth opportunities for the senior management or board of directors as well as the subsequent support and monitoring of its implementation. Both in the development phase and the implementation phase, the business developer collaborates and integrates the knowledge and feedback from the organization's specialist functions, for example, research and development, production, marketing, and sales to assure that the organization is capable of implementing the growth opportunity successfully. The business developers' tools to address the business development tasks are the business model answering \\"how do we make money\\" and its analytical backup and roadmap for implementation, the business plan. Business development professionals frequently have had earlier experience in sales, financial services, investment banking or management consulting, and delivery; although some find their route to this area by climbing the corporate ladder in functions such as operations management. Skill sets and experience for business-development specialists usually consist of a mixture of the following (depending on the business requirements): * Sales * Finance * Marketing * Mergers and acquisitions * Legal * Strategic management * Proposal management or capture management The \\"pipeline\\" refers to the flow of potential clients which a company has started developing. Business development staff assign to each potential client in the pipeline a percent chance of success, with projected sales-volumes attached. Planners can use the weighted average of all the potential clients in the pipeline to project staffing to manage the new activity when finalized. Enterprises usually support pipelines with some kind of customer relationship management tool or database, either web-based solution or an in-house system. Sometimes business development specialists manage and analyze the data to produce sales management information. Such management of information could include: * reasons for wins/losses * progress of opportunities in relation to the sales process * top performing salespeople/sales channels * sales of services/products For larger and well-established companies, especially in technology-related industries, the term \\"business development\\" often refers to setting up and managing strategic relationships and alliances with other, third-party companies. In these instances, the companies may leverage each other's expertise, technologies or other intellectual property to expand their capacities for identifying, researching, analyzing and bringing to market new businesses and new products. Business development focuses on the implementation of the strategic business plan through equity financing, acquisition/divestiture of technologies, products, and companies, plus the establishment of strategic partnerships where appropriate. Business development is to be thought of as a marketing tactic. The objectives include branding, expansion in markets, new user acquisition, and awareness. However, the main function of business development is to utilize partners in selling to the right customers. Creating opportunities for value to be ongoing in the long term is important. To be successful in business development the partnership must be built on strong relationships.  Business Development and Ethics   Facilitated development  Business Development is affected by external factors. \\"Planning Systems\\" are systems set in place in order to regulate businesses. In many cases, ruling agencies deem the necessary for business survival. There is a section of Business that is dedicated to facilitating ethical business development in developing countries. In the early 2000s, Business Ethics was dedicated to helping the Businesses in need that are in these countries. However, owing to the strong backlash from critics, they have changed their focus into helping businesses that are going to help the most people develop. These policies have improved the quality of life of the people. However, this facilitation changes the norms and, in turn, harms some groups. In order to enforce the new policies in an ethical manner Business Ethicists have created a cost-benefit analysis, placing an emphasis on basic necessities. These concerns have become so great that Business Ethicists have created a new department called Development Ethics. Now, instead of simply helping developing businesses, international business developers have begun ensuring that the companies keep basic human rights in mind. This especially applies to countries where the laws are not so strict and allow for abuse to take place. These development policies now have to follow the criteria that Penz created, consisting of: security, empowerment, rights, equity, integrity, and cultural freedom. The idea of providing people with human rights in order to facilitate business development can be seen through the rapid development of China in the last few decades. The policies that were implemented in the last couple decades coincide with these developments. In the 1980s, government policies facilitated the rise in literacy rate and education. The following decade, healthcare coverage increased significantly. This development was not originally seen as monetary capital, but instead, it was seen as human capital. With more workers able to bring skill and maximum effort to their workplace, companies were able to develop extremely rapidly.  Reputation building  With companies becoming more and more conscious of ethical practices, closely watching themselves to avoid scrutiny, a company's reputation has become a great concern. Ethical business practices are closely tied with reputation which makes it essential to follow ethical guidelines if a company is looking to build their reputation. In fact, Businesses that develop quickly and successfully have tendencies to show honesty, impartiality, and service to all of their stakeholders. In order for a company to be considered \\"ethical\\", it must cater to the needs of the customer, keeping their best interest in mind. This will influence customers to make repeated purchases and lead to more profit. In order for a company to build a strong reputation with their suppliers, it is crucial for them to focus on impartial business interactions and developing long relationships. These relationships can lead to mutually-beneficial business deals for both the company and its supplier. With the employees, they must take their interests into consideration and facilitate teamwork as opposed to rigorous competition. This ensures that the company will keep their most loyal and dedicated employees for as long as possible. Funding for further development can rise when a company is able to develop strong relationship with each stakeholder individually, and ethically. This is based on the concept of reciprocation, which states how in order for social change to take place between groups of people, trust must be built between them through mutually beneficial actions. This can be supported through the results of a questionnaire study that was conducted on technology industries in GTSM and TSE. In addition, in order for a company to practice business ethics, and ensure strong business development, it is essential to maintain a positive relationship with the environment. With concerns about the recent decline of the environment increasing, stakeholders have become more involved in efforts to preserve resources and a negative impact on the environment brings about risks of damaging stakeholder relationships.

The Villa Aldobrandini is a villa in Frascati, Italy. Still the property of, and still lived in by, the Aldobrandini family, it is known as Belvedere for its charming location overlooking the valley toward the city of Rome. It is the only grand Papal garden not owned by the state. Construction Vatican prelate Alessandro Rufini built the original villa in 1550. Pope Clement VIII gave his nephew Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini the villa in 1598Attlee. Page 91. as a reward for the negotiations he undertook with France which resulted in the peace treaty of 1595 and for his role in annexing Ferrara to the Papal States. Clement's gift also ensured the property remained in the family as Popes are not allowed to own property. Conversion Aldobrandini commissioned the Roman architect Giacomo della Porta to convert the villa into suitable accommodation in which a Cardinal could live and also entertain a Pope. Works started in 1598.Attlee. Page 91. While the core of the villa was completed by the time of Giacomo della Porta's death in 1603, work continued for another 20 years on the various aspects of the villa and the garden under the supervision of Carlo Maderno who added the loggiaAttlee. Page 92. and Giovanni Fontana. The villa is aligned with the cathedral down its axial avenue that is continued through the town as Viale Catone. The villa has an imposing 17th century facade and some other interesting architectural and environmental features, such as the double gallery order on the rear facade, the spiral-shaped flights, the large exedra of the Water Theatre and a magnificent park. Art Inside the villa are paintings of Mannerist and Baroque artists like Taddeo Zuccari and his brother Federico, Cavalier D'Arpino and Domenichino. On the grounds is a monumental gate by Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri (early 18th century). Water Theater A noted feature of the garden is the Teatro delle Acque (\\"Water Theater\\") by Carlo Maderno and Orazio Olivieri. To provide water for this feature and for the rest of the garden, Aldobrandini constructed a new long aqueduct from the Modena spring on Monte Algido to the villa.Attlee. Page 92. The top of the garden in the villa has remained derelict and damaged since the American bombing during the Allied invasion in World War II, and the fountains of Teatro delle Acqua sustained damage as well from the bombing, with current owner Prince Camillo Aldobrandini's father carrying out repairs to the fountains shortly after. However having used cement, the fountains were in a bad state when Prince Camillo began restoration works in 2011. Prince Camillo stated that Napoleon, who was related to the Aldobrandini's through marriage, took statues that were all along the top of the balustrade of the Teatro and said he would pay Aldobrandini after coming back from Russia.Monty Don Villa Aldobrandini - Ninfeo.

Biography  Humble was born in Hartburn, County Durham, but moved to London in 1880 to work at the Royal Arsenal, in a somewhat unusual manner; he and his brother walked the 400-mile journey south from their home village to the capital, which made headlines in the local newspapers back home. A staunchly left-wing man and a member of local socialist parties, he strongly believed in workers' rights and campaigned for shorter working hours and more time for leisure activities, which included football, a passion of his. Humble met several other football fanatics, such as David Danskin, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates at the Royal Arsenal and in 1886 became one of the founding members of Dial Square Football Club, who were soon renamed Royal Arsenal, and would eventually become the club known today as Arsenal. Royal Arsenal soon became one of the strongest amateur sides in Southern England. Humble played for Royal Arsenal during 1887-88 and 1888‚Äì89, mainly as a full-back or half- back.http://www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/2010/12/21/124-years-on-lets- celebrate-jack-humble-the-founding-father-of-arsenal-fc/ Humble's biggest contribution to Arsenal was his successful drive to turn the club professional. In 1891 Derby County tried to recruit two of Royal Arsenal's players after an FA Cup match between the clubs; Humble and Danskin realised that the club would be unable to survive if its players were being continually tempted away. Therefore, at the club's 1891 AGM, Humble proposed the club turn professional; however with his socialist views, he baulked at turning the club into a limited liability company at the same time, declaring: \\"The club [has been] carried on by working men and it is my ambition to see it carried on by them.\\" The rest of the London footballing world, dominated by an ethos of amateurism, quickly shunned Woolwich Arsenal (as the club had been renamed); they were expelled from the London Football Association. Boycotted by other sides, Arsenal could well have gone bankrupt, but in 1893 Humble's decision was vindicated as they were invited to join the Football League, making them the first southern club to become a League member. By this time Humble had become a full director of the club, having reluctantly accepted the club's need to become a commercial company in 1893. Humble would remain a director of the club for over thirty years, during which time they moved to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, north London and became known simple as \\"Arsenal\\". He continued to work at the Royal Arsenal as a gun inspector, and spent World War I seconded in Sheffield and then Norway. He was the last original founding member to have a formal connection with Arsenal, and over time became the club's unofficial historian by virtue of being there longer than anyone else. In 1929, however, he was forced to resign from the Arsenal board in the same financial scandal which brought down chairman Sir Henry Norris; Norris had used the club's expenses account for his own use, and had personally profited from the sale of the team bus. Although Humble himself was entirely innocent of any charges, the Football Association ruled that as a director he should have scrutinised Norris's financial dealings more closely, and suspended him from football. Humble was still alive to witness Arsenal's FA Cup win of 1930. He died in December 1931, aged 69.

It is a tributary of the Greenbrier River. Leatherbark Run has the distinction of being West Virginia's highest stream. It begins at a natural spring on the south face of Bald Knob on Back Allegheny Mountain in the western half of the county. The elevation of its headwaters is above sea level. It then proceeds south down the side of the mountain, then turns eastward near Whittaker and continues in that direction until it flows into the Greenbrier at the town of Cass. The total elevation change from its headwaters to its mouth is approximately , more than any other stream in the state. Leatherbark Run was the site of a major logging railroad operation in the early 1900s. Surveyors for the railroad concluded that a railway up alongside of Leatherbark Run was the only feasible way to cross the Allegheny Mountains to reach the vast spruce forests that thrived above . Today, Cass Scenic Railroad still uses this route to carry passengers into the mountains via Leatherbark Run. The stream is also noted for its potential to flash flood. Leatherbark Run can flood even when it is not raining in Cass because of the location of its headwaters in a very mountainous area that is notorious for its rapidly changing weather.

The population in 2011 was 13,187,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 437.07 km¬≤.√Åreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e pa√≠s The town proper has about 3,456 residents.  History  The lookout and battlements of the Castle of Pena de Aguiar Casa do Condado of Ferreira Botelho and Albino √Çngelo Ferreira Botelho, today the Municipal Museum The origin of Vila Pouca da Aguiar has caused differing opinions. Some authors hypothesis that \\"Vila Pouca\\" was the successor to the ancient city of \\"Cauca\\", which was governed by Emperor Theodosius I. Yet, this theory can not explain the name transition from Cauca to Pouca. Another belief is that \\"Vila Pouca\\" was a reference to a small agrarian community, and that \\"Aguiar\\" was a reference to an ancient administrative region. The name was, therefore, most likely, a phrase to disambiguate all the other communities named \\"Vila Pouca\\". Literally, the name means \\"Vila Pouca OF Aguiar\\", wherein etymologically, \\"aguiar\\" derived from the word aquila to designate \\"where the eagles are\\" (√°guia is ). In the 13th century, the municipality of Vila Pouca de Aguiar was part of the land of Aguiar, much like other such as sites, like the Ribeira de Pena (or ). In the 12 and 13th century, Aguiar was constituted by seven grande ecclesiastical parishes, which included S√£o Salvador de Jugal, which corresponded to the actual parish of Vila Pouca de Aguiar. The Inquiri√ß√µes (inquiries/inventory) of King Afonso II established that the parochia of S√£o Salvador de Jugal was composed of the localities and towns: Condado (three couples); Calvos (one couple); Guilhado (four couples) and Nuzedo (20 couples), in addition to the towns of Fraengo and Outeiro. The document also identifies Jugal as an administrative unit, with elaborated administrative domain over the territory of Aguiar, and where the parochial church was located, but no reference to Jugal as a town. There is no indication as to the motives for changing the name from S√£o Salvador de Jugal to Vila Pouca, nor the date, although it likely occurred sometime in the 14th century. In the early 20th century, the leading figure in the area was Martiniano Jos√© Ferreira Botelho, a doctor, druggist and politician, known from his humanitarian character and support of the use of the local medicinal waters for treatmentsDicion√°rio dos mais ilustres Transmontanos e Alto Durienses, coordenado por Barroso da Fonte, III volume, 656 p√°ginas, Editora Cidade Ber√ßo. The Botelhos donated land to the community for the current market square, as well as the municipal slaughter house and well. Geography Integrated into the Alto T√¢mega subregion, the municipality of Vila Pouca de Aguiar is situated in the north of the district of Vila Real, between the mountains of Serra do Alv√£o and Serra da Padrela, extending over a territory of approximately 437 km¬≤. It is located within a strategic connection, not just between other Portuguese municipalities in the interior but also, as a transit point to the coastal areas (across the A7 and A24 motorways). Within a long fertile valley, and surrounded by high pasture- lands, it is defensively safe within the Transmontana escarpments. The region is covered in national monuments and historical structures: the Castle of Aguiar da Pena, the millenarian Roman mining complex of Tresminas, the thermals of Pedras Salgadas, several leisure centres (such as the Falperra Dam/Reservoir), the Dolmens of Alv√£o, churches, graves/funeral sites, medieval bridges, sun-dials and castro dot the landscape of this unassuming region. It is located in a narrow valley 25 kilometers north of the district capital, Vila Real, and is connected to the same by national N2 highway. In 2006 the A7 toll road to Guimar√£es was completed and the last stretch of the A24, connecting Vila Pouca with Vila Real was opened in June 2007. This non-toll four-lane highway links Coimbra with the Spanish border in Vila Verde. One of the longest and highest highway bridges in Europe was built just south of Vila Pouca, carrying traffic across the fertile valley. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 14 civil parishes (freguesias): * Alfarela de Jales * Alv√£o * Bornes de Aguiar * Bragado * Capeludos * Pensalvos e Parada de Monteiros * Sabroso de Aguiar * Soutelo de Aguiar * Tel√µes * Tresminas * Valoura * Vila Pouca de Aguiar * Vreia de Bornes * Vreia de Jales Vila Pouca de Aguiar has for many years experienced the desertification of the Portuguese interior. Population densities have historically identified a strong concentration of people in the municipal seat, or its peripheral parishes. From 1981 to 1991, the parishes of Bragado, Pensalves, Afonsim, Vreia de Jales, Vreia de Bornes, Valoura and Soutelo de Aguiar have registered flawing population growth rates. The parish of Sabroso de Aguiar did not exist in 1981, but by 1991 it registered the highest population concentration in the region. Comparatively, between 1991 and 2001, there were no changes in population densities in many of the parishes. The municipal seat and Sabroso de Aguiar continue to show a growth in population density.

The small valleys support cattle which graze in the open pasturelands. The lands of the Alv√£o valley benefited from the construction of the Alv√£o Dam/Reservoir, which allowed irrigation of these lands since the mid-20th century. In addition, the economy supports small service industries, government-based dominated tertiary employment, the granite extraction industry (concentrated in the mines of Jales) and the mineral waters in Pedras Salgadas, a small spa town located about ten kilometers north on the main highway to Chaves.

An apartment manager of a complex about a mile from Huff's residence called police about a possible bomb he found while inspecting dumpsters, although that bomb turned out to be just modeling clay and wires. In the investigation afterwards, police found a handwritten note in the dumpster apparently written by Huff. On June 6, the police released the letter, not yet authenticated, to the media.Claudia Rowe, Letter rages at ravers' lifestyle, Seattle P-I, June 7, 2006. A week later, the Washington State Patrol's State Crime Lab concluded that it was \\"highly probable\\" that the letter was authentic. Arguments in favor of authenticity included the fact that the letter was written on stationery from the apartment complex where the Huff brothers lived and matched several known samples of the killer's writing, according to crime lab experts.AP, Crime lab says it is \\"highly probable\\" that Huff wrote note , Seattle Times, June 14, 2006.

It ended with the quote \\"Now, kids, Now\\", reminiscent of the letters \\"NOW\\" that Huff spray painted during the massacre. In July 2006, an investigative panel released its findings to the public. In attempting to explain Huff's motivations, the panel suggested that a Nirvana song called \\"I Want to Know Now\\", with a chorus refrain of \\"now, now, now, now\\" influenced Huff's spray painted message.Jennifer Sullivan and Hal Bernton, Mass killer Huff stalked rave community, panel reports , The Seattle Times, July 17, 2006 Legacy The Capitol Hill massacre was the worst mass killing in Seattle since the 1983 Wah Mee massacre in which 13 died.Seattle Times staff, Capitol Hill rampage worst since Wah Mee Massacre , Seattle Times, March 26, 2006.

This was about a guy who decided he was going to kill people and he had the firepower to do it.\\" Several city council members spoke up against the \\"quick fix\\" mentality inherent in the Times editorial; council member Peter Steinbrueck added he was \\"really incredulous over young teenaged girls going out all night unsupervised and mixing with much older people,\\" but didn't see that as an issue over the nature of the place where they had socialized.

It is the arms of the local Lords of Vilanders and Pardell. The emblem was granted in 1966.Heraldry of the World: Villander  Toponym  Villanders was first mentioned in an official document in 1070 under the name Filandres; in 1085 under the name Filanders, later on as Filanders or Vylanders. The origin of the name Villanders, which is often believed to derive from the term \\"viel anders\\" meaning \\"a lot different\\", is not clear to date. Sometimes, the name is believed to have pre- Roman origins (similar to the neighbouring villages Verdings/Verdignes and Feldthurns/Velturno). Other linguists have tried to look for Roman roots (for example \\"villa antrorum\\" or \\"valles antri\\"), while others even suspect a connection to Flanders in Belgium. However, none of these proposals is convincing. Following a legend, some people in Villanders believe the village was first called \\"Sch√∂nberg\\", meaning beautiful mountain, and when it was destroyed by a landslide, everything looked \\"a lot different\\" (\\"viel anders\\" in German) afterwards.  Prehistory and early history  It can be supposed that in the distant mists of time people discovered that life was pleasant on the fertile moraine soil of the sunny slopes of Villanders and so they settled there. There is evidence that the adjoining Sarntal valley and the surrounding mountains, including the Villanders Mountain and the Alpine meadow have been explored by men and economically exploited since at least the Mesolithic. These finds and the features of the landscape of the alpine meadow of Villanders, which is an ideal grazing ground for ibex, the preferred prey of Mesolithic hunters, suggest that the entire meadow was a summer hunting ground at that time. During excavations in the archaeological zone at Plunacker in the area within and around the village of Villanders, a Mesolithic occupation layer was uncovered, containing stone tools made from flint from the 8th and 7th centuries BC. At the beginning of the Neolithic from 5000 BC the cultivation of the land and the keeping of domestic animals indicate that people now lived a settled life in South Tyrol. The low mountain landscape in Villanders offered favourable conditions for this. The finds in the Plunacker archaeological zone in Villanders are among the most significant of this epoch in the whole of the Alps. Finds from the Neolithic on the alpine meadows of Villanders also provide evidence of the presence of men at higher levels, but allow no inference as to the use of the alpine meadow for agriculture in the narrower sense of the term. Finds from the Copper and Bronze Ages are indeed rare; however finds in the surrounding communities of Brixen/Bressanone, Saubach and Barbian/Barbiano do suggest that there was a continuous history of settlement. It is probable that mining had already begun and the copper extracted was sold to communities to the South; at Lake Garda and in the Pianura Padana. The Mediterranean influence on the Southern Alps can also be seen in the world of the intellect: writing on the Etruscan model was introduced and depiction of the gods resembled the Greek and Italian or Etruscan style.  Roman times  Roman times in what is today known as South Tyrol, begins at the latest with the Emperor Augustus (31 BC - 14 AD) and continues into the 5th and 6th centuries AD. The area around Villanders at that time was continuously settled, but still patchily. The only finds discovered to date were found on the Plunacker. Here the remains of a large and well appointed Roman villa were discovered. At that time the area between Ritten/Renon and Villanders lay in the border country between Trento/Tridentum, Noricum and Rhaetia, but it is impossible to be more precise, because we lack archaeological evidence.  The Middle Ages  As in other parts of South Tyrol there are very few traces in Villanders from the Early and High Middle Ages (approx. 500-1350 AD). However, it can be assumed that settlement continued, but as yet we have not been fortunate enough to find the evidence of the unbroken inhabitation of any farm from Late Antiquity up to the High Middle Ages.  The Lords of Vilanders  The title, the \\"Lords of Vilanders\\" denoted one of the most powerful noble clans in the Tyrol of the Middle Ages, with its home in Villanders. They were prosperous farmers, who lived in large farmhouses, more like manor houses, and who were soon keen to extend their possessions and to gain political influence. The first reference to the Lords of Vilanders can be found in church records from the first half of the 12th century. The addition of \\"von Vilanders\\" (of Vilanders) became increasingly common during the 13th century and was used by various families, who were not related to each other. The genealogy of the Lords of Vilanders begins with Ekkehard I of Vilanders (1176‚Äì1183) then divides into twelve branches. At first the Lords of Vilanders established themselves as Ministeriales of the Brixen and Trento bishops and in the Villanders court, which formed its own judicial district within the County of Bozen. They were put in charge of fortified castles to control strategically important points, such as the Trostburg, which was granted by Count Meinhard to the judge of Villanders, Randold von Vilanders zu Pradell, who thereupon became the progenitor of the Counts von Wolkenstein and thus also the forebear of the great mediaeval minstrel, Oswald von Wolkenstein. The political rise of the Lords of Vilanders began under the rule of the Tyrolean Count, Meinhard II (1258 ‚Äì 1295). They increasingly occupied posts as judges, guardians, canons and deacons and guarded the interests of the nobles at the regional parliaments. Under the reigns of the sons of Meinhard II, Otto, Ludwig and Heinrich the Lords of Vilanders were finally able to secure their position and even to rise to higher social levels. Their estates now extended from Sterzing to Bozen, into the Puster Valley, to Villn√∂√ü and into the Gr√∂den Valley, but they also possessed castles and courts in Tramin, Buchenstein (Livinallongo), Feltre and Belluno. The two most important representatives of the Lords of Vilanders were Engelmar and Tegen von Vilanders. They obtained the money to maintain all these estates principally in military campaigns in Italy; for example they fought on the side of Scaligeri of Verona against Padua. In the quarrels over the land of mountain passes, namely Tyrol, between the Austrian Habsburgs, the Bavarian Wittelsbachs and the Luxembourgers, Engelmar von Vilanders played an inglorious role, which brought about the decline of the Lords of Vilanders. Engelmar von Vilanders, who had meanwhile become governor, thought he could make money from the feud. However, his lack of political acumen sealed his fate. To begin with, he conducted negotiations, which bordered on treason, with the Luxembourgers and their ally, the Bishop of Trento, then did an about-turn, when the defeat of the Luxembourgers loomed over the horizon. At the beginning of April 1347 he swore an oath of loyalty to the Tyrolean sovereign once more. He was pardoned, but had to resign from the post of governor and lost many of his possessions. After their defeat in the wars the Luxembourgers tried once more to bribe the Tyrolean noblemen to rejoin their side. The Lords of Vilanders were unable to resist them and once more allowed themselves to negotiate with their country's enemy. In addition, in October 1347 Engelmar von Vilanders concluded a treaty with the Bishop of Trento, in which they pledged mutual support in the event of an attack. In the autumn of 1347, Emperor Louis IV the Bavarian led the decisive campaign against his enemies, defeated the bishop of Trento and took his revenge on the former governor, Engelmar von Vilanders, who was charged with high treason, pronounced guilty and sentenced to death. Subsequently, he was beheaded in front of his brother's castle. As a consequence the von Vilanders lost the majority of their possessions. Ekkehard von Vilanders-Trostburg was the only member of the family to regain any political influence, but he was unable to prevent the once powerful line of the Lords of Vilanders from dying out in 1547. Society Linguistic distribution According to the 2011 census, 98.46% of the population speak German, 1.15% Italian and 0.38% Ladin as first language.  Culture and sights of interest  Villanders is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the Isarco Valley. The surroundings are used for hiking, be it in the valley or on the alpine meadows. Villanders is also known for its mines, which are open to the public. During the Middle Ages the mines were amongst the most important in Tyrol. Especially during the 16th century the mines had a big influence on life in Villanders and Klausen. The cemetery near the St. Stephen's Parish Church with its wrought-iron crosses facing away from the grave, is also well known. The tradition of T√∂rggelen, which includes tasting the new wine and eating typical farmers' dishes, is also widespread. The geographic centre of South Tyrol is also located in the community of Villanders, precisely on the Alpine meadow, the Villanderer Alm, just below Villanders Mountain.

The number of tines on tools varies widely - a pitchfork may have just two, a garden fork may have four, and a rake or harrow many. Tines may be blunt, such as those on a fork used as an eating utensil; or sharp, as on a pitchfork; or even barbed, as on a trident. The terms tine and prong are mostly interchangeable. A tooth of a comb is a tine. The term is also used on musical instruments such as the Jew's harp, tuning fork, guitaret, music box or mbira which contain long protruding metal spikes (\\"tines\\") which are plucked to produce notes. Tines and prongs occur in nature‚Äîfor example, forming the branched bony antlers of deer or the forked horns of pronghorn antelopes.

It's widely accepted that in the antiquity there were two cities with this name, both located in Southern Italy. One of them, Petilia, was located in ancient Lucania (today's Basilicata and Campania), while the second one, Petelia, was located on the coast of Bruttium (today's Calabria).  Petilia (Lucania)  Strabo states that Petilia had a prestigious status among Lucanians, even though the same author, in his work Geographica, often mistakes Petilia with Petelia. According to modern scholars, Petilia was probably the city whose remains are found on Monte Stella. This last discovery was made by historian Giuseppe Antonini (1683-1785), based on some inscriptions reportedly found on the same site. Monte Stella is now a military area and permissions for archeological excavations are not granted easily.  Petelia (near Bruttium)  During the Second Punic War Petelia remained a Roman ally, while all of the other Bruttian cities had gone over to Hannibal. After a long siege, it was taken by the Carthaginians, its people expelled and replaced by other Bruttians; but following the Roman victory its original population was restored. Petelia's remains might be located in today's Petilia Policastro or Strongoli. The Petelia Gold Tablet was discovered near Strongoli in the nineteenth century. Some historians claim that Ancient Petelia already was a bishopric, established perhaps in 546 or then adopting the city's new medieval name Strongoli, but without solid evidence, and the see is never mentioned in the Byzantine imperial Notitia Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, which most dioceses in Calabria belonged to in the 9th till 11th centuries, so the diocese's foundation may rather date from the Normans, probably late 12th century.

These data are based upon a retrospective review of 672 patients suitable for spinal anaesthesia in surgical procedures less than 60 minutes' duration using 30‚Äì40 mg chloroprocaine. The results showed good surgical anaesthesia, a fast onset time, and postoperative mobilization after 90 minutes without complications. The use of chloroprocaine in the subarachnoid space has been questioned. In the early 1980s, several cases were reported of neurological deficits after inadvertent intrathecal injections intended for epidural delivery. These doses were an order of magnitude higher than is currently used for intrathecal delivery. It is also thought that these deficits were also related to the preservative sodium bisulfate, although this is also controversial. In recent years, several studies have been published on the safe use of intrathecal chloroprocaine when appropriate dosage is used and with preservative-free preparations. It is currently approved for intrathecal use in the United States and in Europe. Obstetrics Amide-linked local anesthetic agents, such as lidocaine and bupivacaine, can become \\"trapped\\" in their ionized forms on the fetal side of the placenta, so their net transfer across the placenta is increased. An ester-linked local anesthetic agent, such as 2-chloroprocaine, is rapidly metabolized, and placental transfer is limited. Since the metabolism of 2-chloroprocaine by fetal plasma is slower than in maternal plasma, the potential for ion trapping exists. Fetal pH is slightly lower than maternal (7.32 to 7.38), thus most unionized drugs are \\"ion trapped\\" to a degree, even in a healthy fetus. Chloroprocaine (pKa 8.7) is the drug of choice for epidural analgesia and a decompensating fetus, because it does not participate in ion trapping. Placental transfer of 2-chloroprocaine is not influenced by fetal acidosis. The in vitro half-life of chloroprocaine is 21 seconds for maternal and 43 seconds for fetal blood. In patients who are homozygous atypical for plasma cholinesterase, chloroprocaine typically exists for two minutes in circulation.Chestnut: Obstetric Anesthesia, 3rd ed, p333.Hughes: Anesthesia for Obstetrics, 4th ed, p75. It is not used in intravenous regional anesthesia due to the risk of thrombophlebitis. Synthesis Chloroprocaine synthesis: H.C. Marks, H.I. Rubin, (1949 to Wallace & Tiernan Inc). The hydrochloride salt of 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoyl chloride is made by the reaction of 2-chloro-4-aminobenzoic acid with thionyl chloride. Synthesis of this drug is then accomplished by directly reacting the product of the last step with the hydrochloride salt of 2-diethylaminoethanol.

Famed for his elegance on the ball and playmaking skills, he is regarded as one of A.S. Roma's greatest players ever, and one of the greatest Italian players never to have been capped by the Italian national team. Career Di Bartolomei was born in a suburb of Rome. He started as a football player in the Garbatella and was recruited in the A.S. Roma junior team at fourteen. He was soon asked to play in the main team, making his debut in the Italian Serie A during the 1972‚Äì73 season. In 1975, he went on loan to Lanerossi Vicenza in Serie B to 'build up his bones' (Bruno Conti another future Roma star, was dispatched to Genoa for the same reason), returning to Rome in 1976 as one of the leading and indispensable players of the team. After Nils Liedholm's return as coach of A.S. Roma, Di Bartolomei became the team's undisputed leader, raising to the title of captain and becoming a fan favourite. When he played, it was common to hear the Roma fans sing the chant \\"Oh, Agostino... Ago, Ago, Ago, Agostino gol!\\" Despite his goalscoring prowess, Roma had several superb playmakers, in Di Bartolomei, compatriot Bruno Conti, and the Brazilians Falc√£o and Toninho Cerezo. Thus, Liedholm decided to move Di Bartolomei in front of the defence for protection, knocking precise passes up the field, with Falc√£o and Ceerezo played in the centre, while Conti would assume a more attacking role behind the forwards. During his time at Roma, he won the Coppa Italia three times, and a memorable scudetto in 1983. The following season, marked by the penalty shootout defeat in the 1984 European Cup final held in Rome against Liverpool F.C., was his last season with A.S. Roma; although Di Bartolomei was able to net Roma's first spot kick, later misses by Bruno Conti and Francesco Graziani ultimately proved to be decisive. After leaving Roma, he was transferred to A.C. Milan that was undergoing a rebuilding process after a disastrous period in which they were relegated to the Serie B twice. After three seasons he left Milan and his career fizzled out after playing for Cesena and Salernitana. He finally retired in 1990. Style of play A tactically intelligent and versatile team player, Di Bartolomei usually played as a central or defensive midfielder in front of the defensive line in a deep-lying playmaking role; he was also capable of playing in a more advanced role, or in the centre of his team's defensive line, where he usually functioned as a sweeper, a position in which he was frequently deployed during Roma's Scudetto victory in the 1982‚Äì83 season, due to his ability to play the ball out from the back or advance into midfield with his head up while in possession of the ball. A quick and hard- working midfielder, although he was not gifted with significant pace, he was known for his stamina and long stride, which enabled him to cover the pitch effectively. Famed for his elegance on the ball, technical ability, and playmaking skills, he was known for his excellent long-passing ability, vision, and ability to read the game, and also possessed an eye for goal, due to his accurate and powerful shot from distance with his right foot; he was also an accurate free-kick and penalty taker, and usually struck the ball without taking a run-up. In addition to his playing ability, he was also known for his outstanding tenacity and charismatic leadership as Roma's captain, both on and off the pitch, in spite of his introverted character. He was also regarded as a serious, composed, and correct player, who was known for his fair play, honesty, and discipline as a footballer. Throughout his career, he was given the nickname Diba. Retirement and death Di Bartolomei suffered from clinical depression in his later years, and committed suicide by shooting himself in his villa in San Marco di Castellabate, on 30 May 1994, ten years to the day after Roma had lost the European Cup final to Liverpool on penalties.

Detail of the map showing the name \\"America\\". Detail of the map showing the names \\"Catigara\\" and \\"Mallaqua\\". The Waldseem√ºller map or Universalis Cosmographia (\\"Universal Cosmography\\") is a printed wall map of the world by German cartographer Martin Waldseem√ºller, originally published in April 1507. It is known as the first map to use the name \\"America\\". The name America is placed on what is now called South America on the main map. As explained in Cosmographiae Introductio, the name was bestowed in honor of the Italian Amerigo Vespucci. The map is drafted on a modification of Ptolemy's second projection, expanded to accommodate the Americas and the high latitudes.Snyder, John P. (1993). Flattening the Earth: 2000 Years of Map Projections, p. 33. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. A single copy of the map survives, presently housed at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Waldseem√ºller also created globe gores, printed maps designed to be cut out and pasted onto spheres to form globes of the Earth. The wall map, and his globe gores of the same date, depict the American continents in two pieces. These depictions differ from the small inset map in the top border of the wall map, which shows the two American continents joined by an isthmus. Wall map Description The wall map consists of twelve sections printed from woodcuts measuring . Each section is one of four horizontally and three vertically, when assembled. The map uses a modified Ptolemaic map projection with curved meridians to depict the entire surface of the Earth. In the upper- mid part of the main map there is inset another, miniature world map representing to some extent an alternative view of the world. Longitudes, which were difficult to determine at the time, are given in terms of degrees east from the Fortunate Islands (considered by Claudius Ptolemy as the westernmost known land) which Waldseem√ºller locates at the Canary Islands. The longitudes of eastern Asian places are too great. Latitudes, which were easy to determine, are also quite far off. For example, \\"Serraleona\\" (Sierra Leone, true latitude about 9¬∞N) is placed south of the equator, and the Cape of Good Hope (true latitude 35¬∞S) is placed at 50¬∞S. The full title of the map is Universalis cosmographia secundum Ptholomaei traditionem et Americi Vespucii aliorumque lustrationes (The Universal Cosmography according to the Tradition of Ptolemy and the Discoveries of Amerigo Vespucci and others). One of the \\"others\\" was Christopher Columbus. The title signalled his intention to combine or harmonize in a unified cosmographic depiction the traditional Ptolemaic geography of Europe, Asia and Africa with the new geographical information provided by Amerigo Vespucci and his fellow discoverers of lands in the western hemisphere. He explained: \\"In designing the sheets of our world-map we have not followed Ptolemy in every respect, particularly as regards the new lands ... We have therefore followed, on the flat map, Ptolemy, except for the new lands and some other things, but on the solid globe, which accompanies the flat map, the description of Amerigo that is appended hereto.\\"\\"nos in depingendis tabulis typi generalis non omnimodo sequutos esse Ptholomaeum, praesertim circa novas terras ... Et ita quidem temporavimus rem ut in plano, circa novas terras & alia quaepiam, Ptholomaeum; in solido vero quod plano additur, descriptionem Americi subsequentem sectatati fuerimus.\\" Martin Waldseem√ºller, Cosmographi√¶ Introductio, cap.ix, f.19 ; transcribed and translated in Marie Armand Pascal d'Avezac, Martin Hylacomylus Waltzem√ºller, ses ouvrages et ses collaborateurs, Paris, Challamel, 1867, p.39. Several earlier maps are believed to be sources, chiefly those based on the Geography (Ptolemy) and the Caveri planisphere and others similar to those of Henricus Martellus or Martin Behaim. The Caribbean and what appears to be Florida were depicted on two earlier charts, the Cantino map, smuggled from Portugal to Italy in 1502 showing details known in 1500, and the Caverio map, drawn circa 1503‚Äì1504 and showing the Gulf of Mexico. While some maps after 1500 show, with ambiguity, an eastern coastline for Asia distinct from the Americas, the Waldseem√ºller map apparently indicates the existence of a new ocean between the trans-Atlantic regions of the Spanish discoveries and the Asia of Ptolemy and Marco Polo as exhibited on the 1492 Behaim globe. The first historical records of Europeans to set eyes on this ocean, the Pacific, are recorded as Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa in 1513. That is five to six years after Waldseem√ºller made his map. In addition, the map apparently predicts the width of South America at certain latitudes to within 70 miles. However, as pointed out by E.G. Ravenstein, this is an illusory effect of the cordiform projection used by Waldseem√ºller, for when the map is laid out on a more familiar equirectangular projection and compared with others of the period also set out on that same projection there is little difference between them: this is particularly evident when the comparison is made with Johannes Sch√∂ner's 1515 globe.E.G. Ravenstein, Martin Behaim: His Life and His Globe, London, George Philip, 1908, p. 36. Waldseem√ºller's 1507 map of America re-drawn on an equirectangular projection and on the same uniform scale as that of Sch√∂ner of 1515, so as to be readily comparable. Sch√∂ner's 1515 map of America re-drawn on an equirectangular projection and on the same uniform scale as that of Waldseem√ºller of 1507, so as to be readily comparable. Apparently among most map-makers until that time, it was still erroneously believed that the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus, Vespucci, and others formed part of the Indies of Asia. Thus some believe that it is impossible that Waldseem√ºller could have known about the Pacific, which is depicted on his map. The historian Peter Whitfield has theorized that Waldseem√ºller incorporated the ocean into his map because Vespucci's accounts of the Americas, with their so-called \\"savage\\" peoples, could not be reconciled with contemporary knowledge of India, China, and the islands of Indies. Thus, in the view of Whitfield, Waldseem√ºller reasoned that the newly discovered lands could not be part of Asia, but must be separate from it, a leap of intuition that was later proved uncannily precise. An alternative explanation is that of George E. Nunn (see below). Mundus Novus, a book attributed to Vespucci (who had himself explored the extensive eastern coast of South America), was widely published throughout Europe after 1504, including by Waldseem√ºller's group in 1507. It had first introduced to Europeans the idea that this was a new continent and not Asia. It is theorized that this led to Waldseem√ºller's separating the Americas from Asia, depicting the Pacific Ocean, and the use of the first name of Vespucci on his map. An explanatory text, the Cosmographiae Introductio, widely believed to have been written by Waldseem√ºller's colleague Matthias Ringmann, accompanied the map. It was said in Chapter IX of that text that the earth was now known to be divided into four parts, of which Europe, Asia and Africa, being contiguous with each other, were continents, while the fourth part, America, was \\"an island, inasmuch as it is found to be surrounded on all sides by the seas\\".Hunc in modum terra iam quadripartita cognoscitur: & sunt tres primae partes continentes: quarta est insula: cum omni quamque mari circumdata conspiciatur ... Nunc vero & haec partes sunt latius lustratae & alia quarta pars per Americum Vesputium (ut in sequentibus audietur) inuenta est. The inscription on the top left corner of the map proclaims that the discovery of America by Columbus and Vespucci fulfilled a prophecy of the Roman poet, Virgil, made in the Aeneid (VI. 795‚Äì797), of a land to be found in the southern hemisphere, to the south of the Tropic of Capricorn: The \\"path\\" referred to is the ecliptic, which marks the sun's yearly movement along the constellations of the zodiac, so that to go beyond it meant crossing the southernmost extent of the ecliptic, the Tropic of Capricorn. 19¬∞ beyond Capricorn is latitude 42¬∞ South, the southernmost extent of America shown on Waldseem√ºller's map. The map legend shows how Waldseem√ºller strove to reconcile the new geographic information with the knowledge inherited from antiquity.Archibald Freeman and Emerson David Fite, A Book of Old Maps delineating American History from the Earliest Days down to the Close of the Revolutionary War, Cambridge (Mass.), Harvard Univ. Press, 1926, p. 26Valerie I. J. Flint, The Imaginative Landscape of Christopher Columbus, Princeton, 1992, 84 n. 8). The most southerly feature named on the coast of America on the Waldseem√ºller map is Rio decananorum, the \\"River of the Cananoreans\\". This was taken from Vespucci, who in 1501 during his voyage along this coast reached the port which he called Cananor (now Canan√©ia). Cananor was the port of Kannur in southern India, the farthest port reached in India during the 1500‚Äì1501 voyage of the Portuguese Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, the discoverer of Brazil, two of whose ships were encountered returning from India by Vespucci.Frederick J. Pohl, Amerigo Vespucci: Pilot Major, New York, Columbia U.P., 1944, p. 225. This may be an indication Waldseem√ºller thought that the \\"River of the Cananoreans\\" could have actually been in the territory of Cananor in India and that America was, therefore, part of India. The name for the northern land mass, Parias, is derived from a passage in the Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci, in which, after several stops, the expedition arrives at a region that was \\"situated in the torrid zone directly under the parallel which describes the Tropic of Cancer. And this province is called by them [the inhabitants] Parias.\\"\\"in torrida zona sita est directe sub paralello qui cancri tropicum describit ... Et p[ro]uincia ipsa Parias ab ipsis nu[n]cupata est\\". Qvattvor Americi Vesputii navigationes, sigs. ciiir‚Äìciii v.Christine R. Johnson, \\"Renaissance German Cosmographers and The Naming of America\\", Past & Present, Number 191, May 2006, pp. 30‚Äì31. Parias was described by Waldseem√ºller's follower, Johannes Sch√∂ner as: \\"The island of Parias, which is not a part or portion of the foregoing [America] but a large, special part of the fourth part of the world\\", indicating uncertainty as to its situation.Johannes Schoner, Luculentissima quaedam terrae totius descriptio, Nuremberg, 1515, Tract. II, fol. 60vQuoted in Chet van Duzer, Johann Sch√∂ner's Globes of 1515: Transcription and Study, Philadelphia, American Philosophical Society, 2010, pp. 104‚Äì105. PARIAS and AMERICA, corresponding to North and South America, are separated by a strait in the region of the present Panama on the main map but on the miniature map inset into the upper-mid part of the main map the isthmus joining the two is unbroken, apparently demonstrating Waldseem√ºller's willingness to represent alternative solutions to a question yet unanswered. The map shows the cities of Catigara (near longitude 180¬∞ and latitude 10¬∞S) and Mallaqua (Malacca, near longitude 170¬∞ and latitude 20¬∞S) on the western coast of the great peninsula that projects from the southeastern part of Asia, or INDIA MERIDIONALIS (Southern India) as Waldseem√ºller called it. This peninsula forms the eastern side of the SINUS MAGNUS (\\"Great Gulf\\"), the Gulf of Thailand.J.W. McCrindle, Ancient India as described by Ptolemy, London, Trubner, 1885, revised edition by Ramachandra Jain, New Delhi, Today & Tomorrow's Printers & Publishers, 1974, p. 204: \\"By the Great Gulf is meant the Gulf of Siam, together with the sea that stretches beyond it toward China\\".Albert Herrmann, \\"Der Magnus Sinus und Cattigara nach Ptolemaeus\\", Comptes Rendus du 15me Congr√®s International de G√©ographie, Amsterdam, 1938, Leiden, Brill, 1938, tome II, sect. IV, G√©ographie Historique et Histoire de la G√©ographie, pp. 123‚Äì128. Amerigo Vespucci, writing of his 1499 voyage, said he had hoped to sail westward from Spain across the Western Ocean (the Atlantic) around the Cape of Cattigara mentioned by Ptolemy into the Sinus Magnus.Amerigo Vespucci to Lorenzo de'Medici, Seville, 18 July 1500; quoted in Ilaria Luzzana Caraci, Amerigo Vespucci, Roma, Istituto poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato, Libreria dello Stato, 1996, Vol. 1, p. 133. Ptolemy understood Cattigara, or Kattigara, to be the most eastern port reached by shipping trading from the Graeco-Roman world to the lands of the Far East. Vespucci failed to find the Cape of Cattigara on his 1499 voyage: he sailed along the coast of Venezuela but not far enough to resolve the question of whether there was a sea passage beyond leading to Ptolemy's Sinus Magnus. The object of his voyage of 1503‚Äì1504 was to reach the fabulous spice emporium of \\"Melaccha in India\\" (that is, Malacca, or Melaka, on the Malay Peninsula).Clements R. Markham, The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci: and Other Documents Illustrative of His Career, London, Hakluyt Society, 1894, p. 53; Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci: delle Isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi Viaggi [1504], Translated by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1916, p. 41. He had learned of Malacca from one Guaspare (or Gaspard), a pilot with Pedro √Ålvares Cabral's fleet on its voyage to India in 1500‚Äì1501, whom Vespucci had encountered in the Atlantic on his return from India in May 1501.Felipe Fern√°ndez-Armesto, Amerigo: The Man who gave his Name to America, New York, Random House, 2007, pp. 86, 168. Christopher Columbus, in his fourth and last voyage of 1502‚Äì1503, planned to follow the coast of Champa southward around the Cape of Cattigara and sail through the strait separating Cattigara from the New World, into the Sinus Magnus to Malacca. This was the route he understood Marco Polo to have gone from China to India in 1292 (although Malacca had not yet been founded in Polo's time).http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ren/Ren1/304.1.html; cited in George E. Nunn, \\"The Three Maplets attributed to Bartholomew Columbus\\", Imago Mundi, vol. 9, 1952, 12‚Äì22.Helen Wallis, \\"What Columbus Knew\\", History Today, vol. 42, May 1992, pp. 17‚Äì23Edmundo O'Gorman, The Invention of America: An Inquiry into the Historical Nature of the New World and the Meaning of its History, Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1961, pp. 106‚Äì122. Columbus anticipated that he would meet up with the expedition sent at the same time from Portugal to Malacca around the Cape of Good Hope under Vasco da Gama, and carried letters of credence from the Spanish monarchs to present to da Gama.The letter, dated 14 March 1502, is published in Martin Fernandez de Navarrete, Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos, 2nd. edn., Madrid, Imprenta Nacional, 1858, p. 430The covering letter to Columbus is published in A. Millares Carlo (ed.), Historia de las Indias por Fray Bart√≥lome de las Casas, M√©xico, Fondo de Cultura Economica, 1951, Lib. 2, cap.iv, pp. 219‚Äì220. The map therefore shows the two cities that were the initial destinations of Amerigo Vespucci and Christopher Columbus in their voyages that led to the unexpected discovery of a New World.Felipe Fern√°ndez-Armesto, Columbus, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1991, pp. 162, 165. Just to the south of Mallaqua (Malacca) is the inscription: hic occisus est S. thomas (Here St. Thomas was killed), referring to the legend that Saint Thomas the Apostle went to India in 52 AD and was killed there in 72 AD. Waldseem√ºller had confused Malacca (Melaka) with Mylapore in India.Ivar Hallberg, L'Extr√™me Orient dans la litt√©rature et la cartographie de l'Occident des XIIIe, XIVe, et XVe Si√®cles, G√∂teborg, Zachryssons, 1906, p. 355 The contemporary understanding of the nature of Columbus' discoveries is demonstrated in the letter written to him by the Aragonese cosmographer and Royal counsellor, Jaume Ferrer, dated 5 August 1495, saying: Divine and infallible Providence sent the great Thomas from the Occident into the Orient in order to declare in India our Holy and Catholic Law; and you, Sir, it has sent to this opposite part of the Orient by way of the Ponient [West] so that by the Divine Will you might arrive in the Orient, and in the farthest parts of India Superior in order that the descendants might hear that which their ancestors neglected concerning the teaching of Thomas ... and very soon you will be by the Divine Grace in the Sinus Magnus, near which the glorious Thomas left his sacred body\\".Martin Fernandez de Navarrete, Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos, Madrid, Imprenta Nacional, 1825‚Äì1837, Vol. II, 104.John Boyd Thacher, Christopher Columbus: His Life, His Work, His Remains, New York, 1903, Vol. II, 365‚Äì366. History At the time this wall map was drawn, Waldseem√ºller was working as part of the group of scholars of the Vosgean Gymnasium at Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges in Lorraine, which in that time belonged to the Holy Roman Empire. The maps were accompanied by the book Cosmographiae Introductio produced by the Vosgean Gymnasium. At the time this photo was taken a facsimile of the Waldseem√ºller map was on display at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. Today, the original is on display. Of the one thousand copies that were printed, only one complete original copy is known to exist today. It was originally owned by Johannes Sch√∂ner (1477‚Äì1547), a Nuremberg astronomer, geographer, and cartographer. Its existence was unknown for a long time until its rediscovery in 1901 in the library of Prince Johannes zu Waldburg-Wolfegg in Schloss Wolfegg in W√ºrttemberg, Germany by the Jesuit historian and cartographer Joseph Fischer. It remained there until 2001 when the United States Library of Congress purchased it from Waldburg-Wolfegg-Waldsee for ten million dollars. Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany symbolically turned over the Waldseem√ºller map on April 30, 2007, within the context of a formal ceremony at the Library of Congress, in Washington, DC. In her remarks, the chancellor stressed that the US contributions to the development of Germany in the postwar period tipped the scales in the decision to turn over the Waldseem√ºller map to the Library of Congress as a sign of transatlantic affinity and as an indication of the numerous German roots to the United States. Today another facsimile of the map is exhibited for the public by the House of Waldburg in their museum on Waldburg Castle in Upper Swabia. Since 2007, to the celebration of the 500 year jubilee of the first edition, the original map has been permanently displayed in the Library of Congress, within a specially-designed microclimate case. An argon atmosphere fills the case to give an anoxic environment. Prior to display, the entire map was the subject of a scientific analysis project using hyperspectral imaging with an advanced LED camera and illumination systemhttps://www.loc.gov/preserv/rt/projects/hyperspec_imaging.html to address preservation storage and display issues.https://www.loc.gov/preservation/outreach/tops/france_easton/ In 2005 the Waldseem√ºller map was nominated by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington for inscription on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register and was inscribed on the register that same year. Nunn's analysis The geographers of Italy and Germany, like Martin Waldseem√ºller and his colleagues, were exponents of a theoretical geography, or cosmography. This means they appealed to theory where their knowledge of the American and Asiatic geography was lacking. That practice differed from the official Portuguese and Spanish cartographers, who omitted from their maps all unexplored coastlines.George E. Nunn, The Columbus and Magellan Concepts of South American Geography, Glenside, Beans Library, 1932. The second century Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy had believed that the known world extended over 180 degrees of longitude from the prime meridian of the Fortunate Isles (possibly the Canary Islands) to the city of Cattigara in southeastern Asia.\\"cum prisci Cosmographi & praesertim Ptolemaeus longitudines locorum a fortunatis insulis in Orientem usque in Cattgaram, Centum, & octoginta gradibus metirentur\\" (the ancient cosmographers, above all Ptolemy, calculated 180 degrees of longitude from the Fortunate Isles/Canaries to Cattigara in the East) : Maximilianus Transsylvanus, De Moluccis Insulis, Cologne, 1523, cap. 4. See Oc Eo (In fact, the difference in longitude between the Canaries, at 16¬∞W, and Cattigara, at 105¬∞E, is just 121¬∞.) He had also thought that the Indian Ocean was completely surrounded by land. Marco Polo demonstrated that an ocean lay east of Asia and was connected with the Indian Ocean. Hence, on the globe made by Martin Behaim in 1492, which combined the geography of Ptolemy with that of Marco Polo, the Indian Ocean was shown as merging with the Western Ocean to the east. Ptolemy's lands to the east of the Indian Ocean, however, were retained in the form of a great promontory projecting far south from the southeastern corner of Asia‚Äîthe peninsula of Upper India (India Superior) upon which the city of Cattigara was situated. Another result of Marco Polo's travels was also shown on Behaim's globe‚Äîthe addition of 60 degrees to the longitude of Asia. Columbus had not actually seen Behaim's globe in 1492 (which apparently owed much to the ideas of Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli); but the globe, except for one important point, reflects the geographical theory on which he apparently based his plan for his first voyage. The exception is that Columbus shortened the length of the degree, thus reducing the distance from the Canaries to Zipangu (Japan), to about 62 degrees or only 775 leagues. Consequently, it seemed to Columbus a relatively simple matter to reach Asia by sailing west. In the early 16th century, two theories prevailed with regard to America (the present South America). According to one theory, that continent was identified with the southeastern promontory of Asia that figures on Behaim's globe, India Superior or the Cape of Cattigara. The other view was that America (South America) was a huge island wholly unconnected with Asia. Balboa called the Pacific the Mar del Sur and referred to it as \\"la otra mar\\", the other sea, by contrast with the Atlantic, evidently with Behaim's concept of only two oceans in mind.Angel de Altolaguirre y Duvale, Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, Madrid, 1914, pp. 16, 19‚Äì21; cited in George E. Nunn, \\"Magellan's Route in the Pacific\\", The Geographical Review, vol. 24, no. 4, October 1934, p. 627. The Mar del Sur, the South Sea, was the part of the Indian Ocean to the south of Asia: the Indian Ocean was the Oceanus Orientalis, the Eastern Ocean, as opposed to the Atlantic or Western Ocean, the Oceanus Occidentalis in Behaim's two ocean world. According to George E. Nunn, the key to Waldseem√ºller's apparent new ocean is found on the three sketch maps made by Bartolom√© Colon (that is, Bartholomew Columbus, Christopher's brother) and Alessandro Zorzi in 1504 to demonstrate the geographical concepts of Christopher Columbus. One of the Columbus/Zorzi sketch maps bears an inscription saying that: \\"According to Marinus of Tyre and Columbus, from Cape St. Vincent to Cattigara is 225 degrees, which is 15 hours; according to Ptolemy as far as Cattigara 180 degrees, which is 12 hours\\".\\"Alberico\\", vol. IV, c. 169, Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Banco Rari 234Sebastian Crino, \\"Schizzi cartografici inediti dei primi anni della scoperta dell' America\\", Rivista marittima, vol. LXIV, no. 9, Supplemento, Novembre 1930, p. 48, fig. 18. This shows that Christopher Columbus overestimated the distance eastward between Portugal and Cattigara as being 225 degrees instead of Ptolemy's estimate of 180 degrees, permitting him to believe the distance westward was only 135 degrees and therefore that the land he found was the East Indies. As noted by Nunn, in accordance with this calculation, the Colon/Zorzi maps employ the longitude estimate of Claudius Ptolemy from Cape St. Vincent eastward to Cattigara, but the longitude calculation of Marinus and Columbus is employed for the space between Cape St. Vincent westward to Cattigara. Nunn pointed out that Martin Waldseem√ºller devised a scheme that showed both the Columbus and the Ptolemy-Behaim concept on the same map. On the right hand side of the Waldseem√ºller 1507 map is shown the Ptolemy-Behaim concept with the Ptolemy longitudes: this shows the huge peninsula of India Superior extending to the south of the Tropic of Capricorn. On the left side of the Waldseem√ºller map the discoveries of Columbus, Vespucci and others are represented as a long strip of land extending from about latitude 50 degree North to latitude 40 degrees South. The western coasts of these trans-Atlantic lands discovered under the Spanish crown are simply described by Waldseem√ºller as Terra Incognita (Unknown Land) or Terra Ulterior Incognita (Unknown Land Beyond), with a conjectural sea to the west, making these lands apparently a distinct continent. America's (that is, South America's) status as a separate island or a part of Asia, specifically, the peninsula of India Superior upon which Cattigara was situated, is left unresolved. As the question of which of the two alternative concepts was correct had not been resolved at the time, both were represented on the same map. Both extremities of the map represent the eastern extremity of Asia, according to the two alternative theories. As Nunn said, \\"This was a very plausible way of presenting a problem at the time insoluble.\\"George E. Nunn, \\"The Lost Globe Gores of Johann Sch√∂ner, 1523‚Äì1524\\", The Geographical Review, vol. 17, no. 3, July 1927, pp. 476-480 https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/208330.pdf?acceptTC=trueGeorge E. Nunn, The World Map of Francesco Roselli, Philadelphia, Beans Library, 1928. As noted by Nunn, the distance between the meridians on the map is different going eastward and westward from the prime meridian which passes through the Fortunate Isles (Canary Islands). This has the effect of representing the eastern coast of Asia twice: once in accordance with Ptolemy's longitudes to show it as Martin Behaim had done on his 1492 globe; and again in accordance with Columbus' calculation of longitudes to show his and the other Spanish navigators' discoveries across the Western Ocean, which Columbus and his followers considered to be part of India Superior.George E. Nunn, Origin of the Strait of Anian Concept, Philadelphia, Beans Library, 1929. On his 1516 world map, the Carta Marina, Waldseem√ºller identified the land he had called Parias on his 1507 map as Terra de Cuba and said it was part of Asia (Asie partis), that is, he explicitly idendified the land discovered by Columbus as the eastern part of Asia. Globe gores Waldseem√ºller gores of 1507 Besides Universalis Cosmographia, Waldseem√ºller published a set of gores for constructing globes. The gores, also containing the inscription America, are believed to have been printed in the same year as the wall map, since Waldseem√ºller mentions them in the introduction to his Cosmographi√¶ Introductio.Shirley, Rodney W. (1993). The Mapping of the World, p. 29. London: New Holland (Publishers) Ltd. On the globe gores, the sea to the west of the notional American west coast is named the Occeanus Occidentalis, that is, the Western or Atlantic Ocean, and where it merges with the Oceanus Orientalis (the Eastern, or Indian Ocean) is hidden by the latitude staff. This appears to indicate uncertainty as to America's location, whether it was an island continent in the Atlantic (Western Ocean) or in fact the great peninsula of India Superior shown on earlier maps, such as the 1489 map of the world by Martellus or the 1492 globe of Behaim. The fifth copy, slightly different from the others Only few copies of the globe gores are extant. The first to be rediscovered was found in 1871 and is now in the James Ford Bell Library of the University of Minnesota. Another copy was found inside a Ptolemy atlas and had been in the Bavarian State Library in Munich since 1990. The Library recognized in February 2018, after reviewing its authenticity, that this map is not an original copy - it was printed in the 20th century. A third copy was discovered in 1992 bound into an edition of Aristotle in the Stadtb√ºcherei Offenburg, a public library in Germany. A fourth copy came to light in 2003 when its European owner read a newspaper article about the Waldseem√ºller map. It was sold at auction to Charles Frodsham & Co. for $1,002,267, a world record price for a single sheet map. In July 2012, a statement was released from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich that a fifth copy of the gore had been found in the LMU Library's collection which is somewhat different from the other copies, perhaps because of a later date of printing. LMU Library has made an electronic version of their copy of the map available online.

The R-29 was a new design developed by Raab's Greek company in late 1936 but shared structural characteristics with the preceding R-27 type (a type also first recorded as an AEKKEA-RAAB product by Jane's 1935 ed., most probably designed earlier by Raab and never produced), including an inline engine, fixed cantilever undercarriage and twin machine-guns. The R-27 differed in using a Hispano- Suiza 12Y engine. Export documents to Spain and Jane's (1936 ed.) reported it as a fighter, but Raab later described it as a trainer,Raab, 1984, p.134 which would be borne out by the low powered engine chosen. A batch of these aircraft, along with the Tigerschwalbe R-26V/33 (derived from an earlier Raab- Katzenstein model), were to be delivered to the Republican forces. Components of 30 aircraft were to be produced in Greece and shipped to Spain, where a subsidiary would carry out final assembly. An AEKKEA aircraft engineer, Georgios Pangakis, reported 40 (rather than 30) R-29s shipped to Spain, still missing engines and machine guns, which proved difficult to acquire. According to Raab, the Republicans gave roughly 60 incomplete airframes of both types, along with plans to the Soviets to be shipped back to the USSR. The AEKKEA archives were destroyed and there seems to be no surviving images and only the contemporary Jane's provides a written description. Specifications See also References Further reading *L.S.

It is predominantly in the London borough of Merton, with parts straddling the borders of Croydon and Sutton. It is designated a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation.  History  In feudal times, the poorest, least productive soil in a parish was designated as common land available for parishioners to graze animals and cut turf and timber for fuel. Members of this community with these rights were known as commoners. However, in the 19th century when material for road building became a valuable resource, the old grazing land was replaced by a series of pits for gravel extraction. These works reached such a proportion that public opposition, led by George Parker Bidder QC, culminated in the protection of the common under the Metropolitan Commons Act and the cost of its maintenance was split between the parish councils of Mitcham, Beddington, Wallington and Croydon according to the proportion of the common within each parish boundary. Mitcham, now part of the London Borough of Merton bears the majority of the costs, with the remainder going to the London Boroughs of Croydon and Sutton. These funds support a warden and three assistants. Each council is represented by four nominated members of The Board, elected every two years.  Geography and environment  Pond on Mitcham Common. The course of the Thames has gradually altered, exposing gravels that were initially colonised by grasses and other Flowering Plants. Over time, woody species slowly overwhelmed these early colonisers, developing a loose scrubby vegetation that became denser until woodland had developed. Early humans were responsible for clearing trees and suppressing their regeneration by grazing cattle and cutting turf and timber for fuel. In the late 19th Century these practices ceased and woodland was allowed to regenerate. This process allowed a succession from grassland, through a series of intermediate stages, to woodland. The river gravels are well drained and strongly acidic, leading to a hostile environment in which plants have to withstand occasional drought and nutrient deficiency. However, considerable areas have acquired foreign soils during landfill programmes, whilst ploughing for agriculture during World War II and numerous pipe laying programmes have brought trapped nutrients to the surface. The result is a patchwork of soil types, each providing different plant and animal habitats. As the grassland reverts to woodland, the various stages in this process create further habitats. The Seven Islands pond is the largest of the ponds on the common, and was created as the result of gravel extraction during the 19th century. The most recent pond to be created, Bidder's pond, was created in 1990 and named for George Parker Bidder. Buildings There are a few buildings on the common. The buildings comprising the Windmill Trading Estate have existed in one form or another since 1782, when the estate was established as workhouses for the poor. Companies to have utilised the buildings include Hooper's Telegraph Works. Recently the Estate has been replaced by a mixed-tenure of housing apartments. The Mill House Ecology Centre and the Harvester (formerly the Mill House Pub) are located near the site of an old windmill, the remnants of which still exist. There also exists upon the common a carved granite stone in commemoration of George Parker Bidder.

The somewhat flat area in the foreground is an incipient pediplain. Cattle on an Oudalan pediplain, between Gorom and Oursi, Burkina Faso. In geology and geomorphology a pediplain (from the Latin pes, genitive case pedis, meaning \\"foot\\") is an extensive plain formed by the coalescence of pediments. The processes through which pediplains forms is known as pediplanation. The concepts of pediplain and pediplanation were first developed by geologist Lester Charles King in his 1942 book South African Scenery. The concept gained notoriety as it was juxtaposed to peneplanation. The coalesced pediments of the pediplains may form a series of very gentle concave slopes. Pediplains main difference to W. M. Davis‚Äô peneplains is in the history and processes behind, and less so in the final shape. Perhaps the most notable difference in form that may be present is that of residual hills which in Davis‚Äô peneplains are to have gentle slopes while in pediplains they ought to have the same steepness as the slopes in the early stages of erosion leading to pediplanation. Pediplanation is linked to scarp retreat in the following way: as scarps retreat over geological time pediments migrate and extend over large areas. The result is that the surface is eroded chiefly backward and that downward erosion is limited. In contrast to common peneplain conceptualizations several pediplains might form simultaneously at different altitudes and do not necessarily grade to a base level. Pediplains are normally formed in areas of arid and semi-arid climate. As climate changes arid and semi-arid periods of pediplanation may alternate with more humid periods of etchplanation resulting in the formation of flattish surfaces (peneplains) of mixed origin (polygenetic). Cryoplanation is a variant of pediplanation that is restricted to cold climates.

History   2000  The Vogel Burda Group founded as a joint venture media company in September, 2000 by two of Germany's leading publishers, the Vogel Media Group and Hubert Burda Media. Under the joint holding company, CHIP-Holding GmbH (later known as Vogel Burda Holding GmbH, Munich, Germany) in which both parties have a 50% share, there was a company for print media, Vogel Burda Communication GmbH. Here Vogel is responsible for publishing management from formerly Vogel Computer Press Munich. Burda appointed a director of finance (CFO). Within the joint company all Vogel Computer Press' print media to-date, as well as the Vogel Media Group's international computer publishing companies in the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Italy, Turkey, China, Malaysia and Singapore are combined, including co-operations with the license partners in India, Indonesia, the Ukraine and Greece.

Nugget Point is one of the most iconic landforms on the Otago coast. Located at the northern end of the Catlins coast, along the road from Kaka Point, this steep headland has a lighthouse at its tip, surrounded by rocky islets (The Nuggets). The point is home to many seabirds, including penguins, gannets and royal spoonbills, and a large breeding colony of fur seals. Roaring Bay, on the south coast of the tip of Nugget Point, is home to a small colony of yellow-eyed penguins. View along path towards Nugget Point lighthouse. Rocky islets (The Nuggets) can be seen beyond the lighthouse. Nugget Point Lighthouse Nugget Point had been considered a significant danger in particular to small vessels trading along the coast to the Clutha River. The lighthouse was built in 1869 and started operating on 4 July 1870.Information panel at Nugget Point lighthouse The tower was constructed from locally quarried stone and stands above the water. Originally powered by an oil burner, it was converted to a 1000 W lamp in 1949 with electricity provided by a diesel generator until the 1960s, when the lighthouse was connected to mains electricity. It was automated in 1989 and is computer- monitored and operated by Maritime New Zealand. Proposed marine reserve Although the headland itself is a scientific reserve, the marine area around it currently has no special protection. While a marine reserve has been proposed twice by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, this has proved controversial. Many of the small local communities, which still rely on fishing for their livelihood, have been a source of opposition to the proposed reserve. Fishing industry bodies such as the Seafood Industry Council have also argued against it. Meanwhile, many University of Otago scientists support a reserve. The initial proposal would have protected more coastline than the latest Department of Conservation proposal, which covers only about one third of the coastline that the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society has proposed protecting, to less than one tenth the distance offshore. Tourism Nugget Point is advertised as a side trip from the Southern Scenic Route, with the main attractions being two easy 20-minute return walks, one to the viewing platform next to the lighthouse, the other to Roaring Bay. The closest village is Kaka Point, which has traveller accommodation. The Nuggets Road is unsealed from Willsher Bay onwards (20 km) and climbs the bluff towards two car parks at Nugget Point. The walk to Roaring Bay starts at the lower car park and leads to a bird hide. Yellow-eyed penguins may be observed here, as well as fur seals and sometimes sea lions and elephant seals (one of few places in the nation with regular occurrences of this species). Cetaceans such as migrating southern right whaleshttps://www.panoramio.com/photo/18808971 and humpback whales, orca, and dolphins such as endemic Hector's dolphins can be seen from the shore.

It led to the largest protests ever in the history of Kanawha County, West Virginia, the shooting of one bystander, and extended school closings. School board ruling On 12 March 1974, the English Language Arts Textbook Committee of Kanawha County, West Virginia recommended 325 books and textbooks to the school board for use in Kanawha elementary schools. Among these were titles such as America Reads and Language of Man.Foerstel 1994, p. 2 These textbooks were part of a new state curriculum that included for the first time the concepts of multiculturalism and egalitarianism in textbook writing. Most school board members saw no reason to question the state's decision, but board member Alice Moore was concerned by the term dialectology, which implied the teaching of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English as \\"equally correct\\" dialects, when she believed they could impede access to higher education and careers. The school board moved to review the books before sending them to schools. Upon receiving the review copies, Moore was disturbed by a quote from the Autobiography of Malcolm X in which he referred to Christians as \\"brainwashed\\"; she requested and received all 300 textbooks, and claimed she found quotes from Allen Ginsberg, Sigmund Freud's Oedipus complex, and convicted Black Panthers such as Eldridge Cleaver and George Jackson. Moore telephoned Mel Gabler, a textbook evaluator who ran Educational Research Analysts, a conservative Christian non-profit organization in Texas. Gabler in return sent pamphlets and outlines of some of the ways in which the content of the books allegedly conflicted with Christian values, moral uprightness, and patriotism. Moore, the wife of a fundamentalist minister, reported her concerns to the board and local newspapers. On 23 May, Moore came to the school board meeting and charged that the textbooks were \\"filthy, disgusting trash, unpatriotic and unduly favoring blacks\\". She argued that the textbooks taught children to disrespect the beliefs of their parents and taught a brand of relativism that did not belong in West Virginia. She generated much publicity for her cause and won the support of the local Parent-Teacher Association and the Magic Valley Mother's Club. However, the West Virginia Council of Churches supported the books. On 27 June the school board met again, with over 1,000 local residents observing, and voted to approve the books after a three-hour debate over the merits of teaching a liberal curriculum. This was met with much consternation from conservative groups. Reverend Marvin Horan called for a boycott of all public schools. Fliers were distributed around the county which purported to demonstrate the lewdness of the books, but were actually quotations from completely different books like Sexual Politics that were not part of the curriculum. When parents could not find these passages in their children's own textbooks, they accused the teachers of hiding the real books from them.Foerstel 1994, p.3 Boycott and violence The boycott escalated quickly. Nine thousand out of 45,000 elementary school students in the county were kept home from school. Thousands of miners, bus drivers, and trucking workers joined in the boycott. The Department of Education called for a compromise, but Reverend Horan denounced them, demanding that the boycott continue until the books were permanently removed and the supporting members of the school board fired. Bombs were planted at an elementary school and a school board building; another elementary school was dynamited, school buses were attacked with shotguns, and the homes of children who continued to attend school during the boycott were stoned. Alice Moore herself fled town during this time.Foerstel 1994, p. 4 Reverend Charles Quigley asked Christians to \\"pray that God will kill the giants who have mocked and made fun of dumb fundamentalists\\", leading one student to point out, \\"They're shooting people because they don't want to see violence in books.\\"Foerstel 1994, 1994, p. 3 Kanawha's sheriff asked for state troopers to be sent in, but West Virginia Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr. denied the request. Schools were closed several times to avoid further violence. In April 1975 Marvin Horan was sentenced to three years in prison on charges related to the bombings, effectively ending the demonstration. In the fall of 1975, the school board restored the full line of books that they had approved before to all county schools. Legacy Joe L. Kincheloe in Understanding the New Right and its Impact on Education (1983) made the argument that the actions of Kanawha County School Board Member Alice Moore and her fundamentalist Christian allies in the 1974 controversy represented a defining moment in not only educational politics but American political history as well. Arguing that the Kanawha County textbook controversy was the first major victory for conservative evangelical Christians in the politically polarizing cultural debates that emerged from the 1960s social unrest, Kincheloe wrote in the early 1980s and in subsequent work that the victory was a key moment in what he and Aaron Gresson (2004) have labeled the right-wing recovery movement. This movement has profoundly shaped subsequent American education and electoral politics, as proponents have attempted to regain the power they perceived themselves to have lost in the 1960s cultural movements. In the case of the Kanawha County controversy, Moore and her supporters perceived that progressive secularists were undermining Christian values in their embrace of moral relativism, atheism and sexual experimentation (amongst other things) in educational textbooks a la 1960s liberationism. After the textbook controversy, a network of private Christian schools was founded across the state, teaching Christian principles in place of the concepts at the center of the controversy.

They were augmented by Paul Harvey on guitar, Robbie France on drums and Harry Sutcliffe on keyboards and programming. They experimented with several other guitarists, including Marty Williamson, Keith Airey and Sabu Bugaban. EBH started in late 1987 by playing a few low-key gigs in London.

Their first single, \\"Big Bubbles, No Troubles\\" (produced by Ralph Ruppert and Lux), was a hit in 1988, receiving several awards in many countries. In the UK Singles Chart the single reached number 41. After the failure of their first album, Homelands, in the United Kingdom, and despite its success elsewhere in Europe, tensions in the band became overwhelming. Nevertheless, from 1989 they recorded the basic tracks of what was to have been their second album with the Fleetwood Mac Mobile, at the Eazee Hire rehearsal complex in London.

As the title suggests, it involves a narrative jump exactly one year into the future of the DC Universe following the events of the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, to explore major changes within the continuities of the many different comic books within the DC Comics range. Synopsis Following the events of the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, every DC comic series jumped ahead in-story by one year. The events of the missing year were depicted in real time in the weekly comic book series 52. The \\"One Year Later\\" storyline started in March 2006, starting the same week that Infinite Crisis #5 went to press, and before the first issue of 52. Most first issues bearing the \\"One Year Later\\" logo were the first parts of multi-issue storylines, and featured major changes to the status quo of each character, often intentionally left unexplained as these details would be filled in by the remaining issues of Infinite Crisis and the 52 series. Numerous prominent heroes were missing or inactive for most of the year as the \\"One Year Later\\" issues commenced. Heroes known to have been gone for the missing year were Aquaman, Batman, Blue Beetle, Green Arrow, Hawkman, Martian Manhunter, Nightwing, Robin, Superman and Wonder Woman. The Flash went missing, but Jay Garrick had been protecting Keystone City in his absence. The DC Trinity The year-long absence of the three most prominent superheroes of the DC Comics universe‚ÄîSuperman, Batman and Wonder Woman‚Äîand their return to active duty was a significant part of both the \\"One Year Later\\" series and 52 series. Superman The Superman storyline \\"Up, Up and Away!\\", was co-written by Geoff Johns and Kurt Busiek, with art by Pete Woods (and two issues by Renato Guedes), and cover art by Terry and Rachel Dodson. The four-month, eight-part introductory story arc ran through both Action Comics #837‚Äì840 and Superman #650‚Äì653. The story primarily featured a depowered Clark Kent (having lost his powers in the climax of Infinite Crisis) using his skills as a journalist to defend Metropolis from both organized crime and Lex Luthor, newly bankrupt and disgraced due to his actions in the series 52. Gradually, however, Superman began to regain his powers, just in time to battle the embittered Luthor as he sought to inflict his revenge upon Metropolis with the help of stolen Kryptonian battle technology and redesigned versions of the Toyman and the Kryptonite Man. Batman The Batman storyline \\"Face the Face\\", was written by James Robinson, with art by Leonard Kirk and Don Kramer. It ran through Detective Comics #817‚Äì820 and Batman #651‚Äì654. It concerned Batman and Robin's return to Gotham City after a year-long absence, and their investigation of a mysterious vigilante murdering low-rank supervillains (including the Ventriloquist and the KGBeast) who appeared to be connected to Harvey Dent, who had reformed and had taken up battling crime on Batman's behalf during his absence. While Dent was not responsible for the killings (the mastermind was actually Great White Shark, who over the previous year had established himself as Gotham's reigning crime boss and the majority of the victims worked for the Penguin, who was away) the resulting stress, paranoia, and resentment of being under suspicion saw the return of his \\"Two-Face\\" persona and his self-scarring, thus returning to his life of crime. The finale also saw Bruce Wayne offer to adopt Tim Drake, the third Robin (now Red Robin), as his son following the deaths of his parents and the events of the Crisis.Batman (vol. 1) #654 (July 2006) As well as Two-Face, \\"One Year Later\\" also saw the return of several other significant elements of the Batman mythos that had previously been written out or retired, including the return of James Gordon as Gotham's police commissioner and Detective Harvey Bullock. Wonder Woman Unlike the Batman and Superman series, Wonder Woman was reintroduced with a new volume at issue one in June 2006. The introductory storyline was titled \\"Who Is Wonder Woman?\\", and it was written by Allan Heinberg with art by Terry and Rachel Dodson. In the story, Donna Troy is depicted as having taken over the Wonder Woman title in Diana's absence, while Diana is shown to have accepted a government position at the Department of Metahuman Affairs under the alias of Diana Prince at Batman's urging. She is directed by Sarge Steel and is ironically assigned to the rescue mission of the new Wonder Woman, who has been captured by several of Wonder Woman's superpowered foes who demand that the \\"real\\" Wonder Woman be submitted to them. She is partnered on the case with a reluctant Tom Tresser, also known as Nemesis. Within the story it has been revealed that prior to her admission into the department, Diana was also photographed in the company of an Eastern mystic code-named I Ching, and that the World Court has dropped the charges against her for the killing of Maxwell Lord. The story was completed in the series' first Annual in 2007.

Relaunches: *The Flash: Fastest Man Alive was started with the first seven issues written by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo (producers of the 1990s Flash TV series) with art by Ken Lashley. With the death of the fourth Flash, Bart Allen at the hands of the Rogues in issue #13, and the subsequent return of Wally West to the DCU this title has reverted to being called The Flash, and picked up its numbering from prior to the name change. Thus The Flash #231 was released in August 2007 and ran through to December 2008 with issue #247. The title was put on hiatus prior to release of The Flash: Rebirth in April 2009. A subsequent reissuing of a new Flash title chronicling the new adventures of Barry Allen began in April 2010, but was brought to an end at issue #12 ahead of the Flashpoint DC Comics event.

Replacements for canceled titles: *Batman Confidential was an ongoing series with revolving creative teams. It concluded in March 2011. *Superman Confidential was an ongoing series with revolving creative teams. It was canceled in April 2008. In July 2006, most DC Comics titles wrapped up their 'One-Year Later' story lines and no longer display the 'One-Year Later' bullet on their covers. Significant events of the lost year Aquaman Aquaman's mysterious disappearance was subsequently followed by the arrival of one Arthur Joseph Curry. This new Arthur's origin appears to be similar to the Golden Age 'Aquaman's. Arthur meets 'The Dweller', who has an enchanted hand similar to Orin's and has been confirmed to be the original Aquaman. 'The Dweller' also tells Arthur of his future, which seems to be describing past events involving the original Aquaman. Freedom of Power Treaty There is a new Freedom of Power Treaty. The specifics and structure have not been detailed, but it appears to place limits on the activities of heroes outside their nation of origin. Having broken the treaty numerous times, Hal Jordan is considered a criminal by most of the world. Only the Rocket Red Brigade, Green Lantern Hal Jordan, and the Outsiders have been confirmed to be affected by it (Green Lantern #10, 2006). The Outsiders operated illegally and underground with all current members at the time (excluding Nightwing) presumed dead by the general public. As well as this, the Chinese government has formed a superteam called the Great Ten in the intervening year, and is currently working on a supersoldier program. Gotham City James Gordon has returned to the role of Gotham City Police Commissioner. Although the exact details have not been revealed as yet, it is known that his return - and that of Harvey Bullock - to the GCPD follows the cracking of a major corruption case in the GCPD by Bullock. Harvey Dent, believed cured of the multiple-personality disorder/psychosis issues that created his Two-Face persona, has been in charge of keeping Gotham safe as a result of a deal with Batman. Superboy memorials Monuments to the fallen hero have been erected in at least two locations: *In Metropolis, the statue depicting Superman holding an eagle dating back to his first battle with Doomsday has been joined by one of Superboy (as seen in Action Comics #837), honoring his sacrifice and actions during Infinite Crisis. 52 #1 depicts the memorial, apparently erected within only a few days of Superboy's death. *A second statue has been erected in San Francisco, in front of Titans Tower. Aftermath The repercussions of One Year Later are still felt today in the DCU in a number of ways. One of the more noticeable occurrences to come out of Infinite Crisis and One Year Later was the change in Batman's demeanor. He has become more accepting of others' opinions, is more polite, and apologizes to allies when he makes errors in judgment. This does not change his approach to crime, however. Some may argue that while he has \\"softened\\" his approach to his friends, he has hardened his approach to his enemies (i.e. forcefully throwing The Joker into a dumpster after he was shot in the head, then remarking that he \\"must have mistaken him for trash.\\") Many Silver Age components have been reintroduced to Superman and his supporting cast. The character of Mon-El, the interior design of the Fortress of Solitude, Superman starting his career by being known as a \\"super- boy\\" (sans uniform), and his teenage membership in the Legion of Super-Heroes are all recognizable Silver Age components that were not included in continuity before Infinite Crisis. The stories are also beginning to aesthetically resemble the Superman feature films by using the same exterior design for the Fortress of Solitude, as well as modeling Jor-El more after actor Marlon Brando. These changes also bring current Superman stories more in line with the television series Smallville, which incorporates many of the same elements of classic comics and the feature films. Wonder Woman actively keeps her secret identity and has a flirtatious relationship with Nemesis, a co-worker at the Department of Metahuman Affairs. The finale of the \\"Who is Wonder Woman\\" arc established that her secret identity is now a physical as well as aesthetic transformation; as \\"Diana Prince\\", she is physically a normal human, regaining her powers only when she transforms into Wonder Woman (with a spinning effect similar to that used in the Wonder Woman television series of the 1970s). Bart Allen's tenure as The Flash was one of the shorter lived occurrences, as the new series starring him lasted 13 issues, the last of which included the character's death. Predecessor Wally West has since retaken the mantle of the Scarlet Speedster. Many heroes, most notably members of the Teen Titans, mourn his loss. This has also led into a subplot in DC's weekly series Countdown to Final Crisis, where many heroes are shown to be actively searching for the Rogues that caused Allen's death. The Green Lantern Corps members that were recovered from the Manhunter homeworld of Biot still despise Hal Jordan for actions Parallax committed while in control of him. Because of this, various personal cliques have formed among certain Lanterns that question Jordan being among them still. Often Jordan is defended by Green Lantern Honor Guard member Guy Gardner. The lost Lanterns proved to be valuable field Lanterns on the front lines in the Sinestro Corps War, with some of them joining the ranks of the Alpha Lanterns. Notes *Grant Morrison has mentioned in interviews that he has, in his spare time, redesigned several unused DC characters. He presented them to Dan DiDio as part of his Seven Soldiers of Victory proposal with several of them, including the redesigned Freedom Fighters and the Atom, debuting in 2006.

It is located on Highway 16A, approximately west of Edmonton and east of Edson. The hamlet is adjacent to the Pembina River and the Pembina River Provincial Park. Evansburg was previously incorporated as a village until June 30, 1998, when it dissolved to become a hamlet within Yellowhead County. Statistics Canada recognizes Evansburg as a designated place.  History  Evansburg is named after Harry Marshall Erskine Evans, former Edmonton mayor and advisor to the Government of Alberta. The post office dates back to 1914.  Demographics  As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Evansburg recorded a population of 795 living in 370 of its 419 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 880. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, Evansburg had a population of 880 living in 353 of its 381 total dwellings, a 0.1% change from its 2006 population of 879. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Arts and culture  The Tipple Park Museum preserves and showcases Evansburg's railway, agricultural and coal mining history. The museum's symbol is a tipple, or a structure at a mine used to load ore or coal.  Home of the Grouch  Evansburg has gained a degree of fame across Canada for being the \\"Home of the Grouch.\\" Every August, as part of the community's Pembina Valley Daze festival, the community chooses the \\"Town Grouch\\". The tradition began in 1961, when local artist John Lauer was commissioned to create a new welcome sign for the community. To add some humour to the sign, he listed Evansburg's population as \\"603 people, 29 dogs, 41 cats, and one grouch.\\" Speculation began as to who the grouch was. In 1979, the Evansburg Chamber of Commerce decided to settle the question by holding an election, in which the community's grouch was elected by the people. The election has been held annually ever since. Lauer himself was elected the grouch in 1995. In the 1990s, Evansburg decided to capitalize on this tradition by adopting the slogan \\"Home of the Grouch\\" and using a scowling coal miner (to also honour its coal mining heritage) as its logo. Far from being an honourary title, the Town Grouch has become a real position with real responsibilities. The chosen citizen becomes Evansburg's ambassador, and represents the community at trade shows and conferences across Canada. He or she is given a uniform consisting of overalls, a pick-axe, and a miner's helmet, all designed to mimic the community's logo. The Town Grouch's home also gets the honorary address of \\"10 Frowning Street.\\" In recent years, the election has been replaced with a competition to see who can raise the most money for Pembina Valley Daze.

History Mark Gainey founded KANA, named after a rescued Shepherd-Husky mix, in 1996. The purpose was to market a software package designed to help businesses manage email and Web- based communications. It grew around this core offering.Taylor, James. \\"First Look ‚Äì Kana ‚Äî JT on EDM.\\" JT on EDM ‚Äî James Taylor on Everything Decision Management. EDM, 10 Aug. 2010. Web. 26 Aug. 2011. . In 1999, KANA Communications (as it was then known) acquired Connectify followed by Business Evolution and NetDialog. In 2000, KANA made its then-largest acquisition, Silknet Software. The purchase price was $4.2 billion, despite the fact that both companies were relatively small. Silknet was an early multichannel marketing software company. Industry analysts were generally cool to the purchase though some said it made sense strategically. In 2001, KANA merged with BroadBase software.Kana and Broadbase Software merge to survive KANA was a major stock market success during the dot-com bubble, and while it contracted significantly during the following downturn, it remained in business as an independent company through the following decade. In 2010, Accel-KKR acquired KANA's assets and liabilities for approximately $40.82 million. The same year, KANA acquired Lagan Technologies, a government-to- citizen customer relationship management company based in Northern Ireland. The software was rebranded as LAGAN Enterprise, a package that compiles information from sources such as 311 calls and map overlays to improve resource management. In 2011, KANA purchased Overtone, which allowed companies to monitor social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. The software was rebranded as KANA Experience Analytics. In 2012, KANA bought Trinicom, a Dutch company that makes mid-market customer service multichannel ecommerce, especially in the BeNeLux region. Less than three months later, KANA purchased Sword Ciboodle, a company that specializes in contact center software. Industry analysts generally looked favorably on the acquisition; Ciboodle's established business process management gave KANA products for a full-featured CRM package for customer service with social media marketing. \\"Between the two companies, almost every aspect of customer relationship experience... is covered.\\" The combined organization operates under the KANA brand. Ciboodle's CEO, Mike Hughes, who had led the company prior to its purchase by Sword, left the company after KANA's purchase was finalized. He was replaced by KANA executives. In 2013, KANA announced the KANA Enterprise product which the company marketed as \\"a unified platform supporting both agent-based and customer self-service scenarios\\".

It was also subtitled into Dutch and broadcast in the Netherlands as Alle hens aan dek (All hands on deck). Four series were produced, with 45 episodes made in total, and it enjoyed popularity in Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. The series dealt with life on board a Royal Navy warship, the fictional frigate HMS Hero. It was mainly filmed aboard the frigate . Plot The episodes were written and filmed to reflect the reality of life in the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines in the 1970s. The primary focus for most stories was on the Captain and his fellow officers, but the series also featured life on the lower decks to portray episodes heavily featuring ratings. Episodes featured a variety of events at sea (the Cold War, smuggling, the evacuation of civilians from crisis-hit places, etc.), as well as the personal lives of officers and ratings and the impact their personal lives had on their professional lives and duties. HMS Phoebe, one of the frigates which was the fictional HMS Hero Cast HMS Hero was captained by three very different officers throughout the series. Donald Burton portrayed Commander Mark Nialls, a high flying young officer in the first two series, who was awarded the OBE for his handling of the Hafsidia AffairThe Hafsidia Affair was depicted in \\"A Standing And Jumping War\\", the OBE was mentioned in \\"Who Run Across The Sea\\". Bryan Marshall portrayed Commander Alan Glenn, a former Fleet Air Arm fighter pilot in the third series, and Derek Godfrey portrayed Captain Edward Holt, a former nuclear submariner, in the fourth and final series. The similarly contrasting First Lieutenants of HMS Hero were David Savile as Lieutenant Commander Derek \\"Porky\\" Beaumont in the first three series, and in the fourth and final series Robert Morris as Lieutenant Commander James Napier. Other regular actors in the series included Andrew Burt as Lt. Peek, James Cosmo as L/Reg Fuller, Norman Eshley as Lieutenant Last, Graeme Eton as Lieutenant Wakelin, Don Henderson as Master at Arms Heron, Nigel Humphreys as L / Sea. Anderson, Frank Jarvis as MAA Burnett, John Lee as Lieutenant Commander Kiley, Prunella Ransome as Zoe Carter, and Colin Rix as LMA Milner. Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy co-operation The series enjoyed close collaboration between the Royal Navy and the BBC, and‚Äîunusually for a TV drama of the 1970s‚Äîlooked like a documentary. Seven s played the role of HMS Hero and for continuity, all were repainted with the pennant number F42 of , the main warship used for filming. The others were , , , , and . , a of the Royal Australian Navy, was also used as Hero for some scenes filmed in 1976 in Hong Kong and Singapore. The crews of these frigates - and Derwent - were given Hero cap tallies for filming purposes, and their ships were given HMS Hero ships' badges, name plates and lifebuoys. Similarly, their Westland Wasp helicopters from the Fleet Air Arm's 829 Naval Air Squadron were all repainted with the identification HMS Hero, the code 471, and the nickname \\"The Fighting Forty- Two\\". Among the Wasps used for the fictional Hero Flight were serial numbers XT419 from HMS Phoebes Flight, XV625, and XV626. (One of these Wasps, XV625 still painted with the 471 code, is preserved at in the Royal Naval Air Engineering and Survival School.) These measures, along with the use by all the frigates of the pennant number F42, had the unintended side effect of confusing Soviet spy ships. Other Royal Navy warships used for the series included the aircraft carrier , the helicopter cruiser , the commando carrier and the submarine . The Royal Marine Commandos took part in the series, as also did the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Naval Reserve in the shape of the , the Royal Fleet Auxiliary in the shape of and other ships, and the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service. Westland Wasp 471 - February 1973 Fleet Air Arm squadrons embarked on HMS Ark Royal used for filming included the Buccaneer S 2s of 809 Naval Air Squadron and the Phantom FG 1s of 892 Naval Air Squadron. The Westland Wessex HU 5s of 845 Naval Air Squadron embarked on HMS Bulwark also featured in some episodes. The series was also filmed ashore in, among other places, Gibraltar, Malta, Hong Kong, Singapore, north-east of Isfjellet in Loppa and Larvik in Norway, the Admiralty Experiment Works in Haslar, RNAS Predannack, Portland Harbour, Plymouth Dockyard, Portsmouth Dockyard and South Uist. Theme music The opening and closing music of the series were taken from a march called Warship, composed for the series by Anthony Isaac. The theme was played by the Band of the Royal Marines, Deal, conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Neville, MVO, FRAM, RM. (See links to files of opening and closing music below.) The march is still played by Royal Marine bands. The theme influenced the opening bars of a 2010 march, Scrap Iron Flotilla, composed by Leading Seaman Martyn Hancock of the Royal Australian Navy Band. Series creators The originator of the idea for the series and main script editor was a serving Royal Navy officer, Ian Mackintosh, who worked with BBC producer Anthony Coburn after Mackintosh originally approached the BBC in May 1971. Coburn had for some years wanted to produce a series \\"that would do for the Navy what Z-Cars had done for the Police\\". Apart from Mackintosh, other scriptwriters included Michael J. Bird, and the series was directed by Michael E. Briant among others. Mackintosh was seconded to the BBC for the series, and was awarded the MBE for his work on Warship in 1976. Warship and Blue Peter In 1975 the BBC's children's television programme Blue Peter included a feature about the filming of Warship at Plymouth Dockyard aboard HMS Danae; the item was presented by Lesley Judd. The next year, future Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan played a major role in the episode \\"All of One Company\\". Six episodes of Warship were filmed aboard HMS Danae around that time. Falkland Islands tensions depicted One 1977 episode, \\"A Matter of History\\", depicted a visit by HMS Hero to a fictional British Overseas Territory‚ÄîEddowes Island‚Äîat the time of its handover to an unnamed Latin American country. Eddowes is described as being 50 miles offshore, and the islanders are stated as being offered a choice between retaining British nationality and leaving, or staying and becoming citizens of the unnamed country. The tensions this caused amongst islanders, the ship's company - one of whom is described as having been born on Eddowes - and British and Eddowes government officials are depicted in a realistic way. There were very strong parallels with the contemporary Falkland Islands situation, and the episode foreshadowed the events that led to the Falklands War. Much of the episode was filmed on Dartmoor, states the Michael J. Bird website (link below). During filming of this episode, series creator Ian Mackintosh received news that he had been awarded an MBE for his work on Warship. Warship assessed in retrospect Writing in 2006, historian Professor S.P. MacKenzie judged that: : \\"Warship had succeeded where Making Waves failed because those involved ‚Äì the multi-talented Ian Mackintosh above all ‚Äì managed to create varied and interesting characters and plots in which RN frigates and other vessels served as useful backdrops for the action. Warship, in short, helped the Royal Navy through a combination of competent writing, acting and direction rather more than through using its equipment as a showcase. (...) Mackintosh and those around him knew how to draw in the viewer with stories that were both contemporary and interesting.\\" (Broadcasting the New Navy: the BBC-TV Series Warship (1973‚Äì1977), p.119) \\"Making Waves\\" was a 2004 series made by ITV, and intended to be in the same vein as \\"Warship\\". It proved less successful, and only three episodes were shown out of the six that were made. Products based on Warship Books Ian Mackintosh wrote three books based on the series, which were simultaneously published in hardback and paperback. The books were: * Warship (published in 1973) * HMS Hero (published in 1976) * Holt RN (published in 1977) Board game Series creator Ian Mackintosh also devised a version of the board game Battleships, based on his experience of modern naval tactics and called Warship after the series. It was produced by Merit Toys in 1976, in association with the BBC. Scale model kit Airfix produced a plastic 1/600 scale model kit with decals for the fictional HMS Hero, using their model kit of HMS Leander. Theme music single Columbia Records released a 7-inch single (catalogue reference DB 8998) of the theme music (see above) in 1973. As in the TV series the theme was played by the Band of the Royal Marines, Deal, conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Neville, MVO, FRAM, RM.

After reaching Frodingham Beck at Emmotland, it becomes called the River Hull. It is noteworthy for being the most northerly chalk stream in England. It provides fly fishing for wild brown trout and grayling. Course Starting at Elmswell as a spring from a chalk aquifer, it follows a course which takes it past Little Driffield, around the southern edge of Driffield, through Wansford, past Corpslanding, and joins the Driffield Navigation at Emmotland. In the upper reaches it is known as Elmswell Beck, then Driffield Beck and finally West Beck. As it leaves Driffield, it is referred to as the River Hull as well as West Beck on Environment Agency mapping despite the River Hull traditionally being called so when the beck reaches Emmotland and merges with other watercourses. For the last of the river approaching Corpslanding Bridge it is known as Driffield Navigation (West Beck). Because of the abundance of springs that feed the beck in its upper reaches, it has been observed that West Beck contributes over 80% of the inflow to the River Hull. History The beck was used to power two corn mills; Kings Mill and Bell Mills, both on the upper reach. Kings Mill is a private residence and Bell Mils are in industrial use. Bell Mills were built in 1792 and there are still sluice gates and a mill race adjacent. The lower sections of the west beck are navigable, and Yorkshire Keels used to reach Wansford. Due to the shallowness of the river, an Act of Parliament was passed in 1801 to create the Driffield Navigation and other associated works. The main route was made further north using Frodingham Beck, and then a new canal from Fisholme through Wansford to Driffield, but the act included navigation to Corpslanding. The village of Hutton Cranswick created a wharf at Corpslanding, and this has now become the upper legal limit of navigation on the waterway. The river is for fly fishing only using either dry flies or nymph imitative patterns. Large stretches of the river are owned by fishing syndicates, however day ticket fishing is available at Mulberry Whin. Mulberry Whin offers over a mile of double bank chalk stream fishing on a day ticket basis. Ecology The beck flows past two wetland areas promoted and maintained by Yorkshire Wildlife Trust: Snakeholm Pastures and Skerne Wetlands. The entire headwaters are designated as an SSSI on account of the chalk base, water quality and plant life.

It includes: # the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences # the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems.Luciano Floridi, \\"What is the Philosophy of Information?\\" , Metaphilosophy, 2002, (33), 1/2. History The philosophy of information (PI) has evolved from the philosophy of artificial intelligence, logic of information, cybernetics, social theory, ethics and the study of language and information. Logic of information The logic of information, also known as the logical theory of information, considers the information content of logical signs and expressions along the lines initially developed by Charles Sanders Peirce. Cybernetics One source for the philosophy of information can be found in the technical work of Norbert Wiener, Alan Turing (though his work has a wholly different origin and theoretical framework), William Ross Ashby, Claude Shannon, Warren Weaver, and many other scientists working on computing and information theory back in the early 1950s. See the main article on Cybernetics. Some important work on information and communication was done by Gregory Bateson and his colleagues. Study of language and information Later contributions to the field were made by Fred Dretske, Jon Barwise, Brian Cantwell Smith, and others. The Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI) was founded at Stanford University in 1983 by philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and psychologists, under the direction of John Perry and Jon Barwise. P.I. More recently this field has become known as the philosophy of information. The expression was coined in the 1990s by Luciano Floridi, who has published prolifically in this area with the intention of elaborating a unified and coherent, conceptual frame for the whole subject. Definitions of \\"information\\" The concept information has been defined by several theorists. Peirce Charles S. Peirce's theory of information was embedded in his wider theory of symbolic communication he called the semeiotic, now a major part of semiotics. For Peirce, information integrates the aspects of signs and expressions separately covered by the concepts of denotation and extension, on the one hand, and by connotation and comprehension on the other.  Shannon and Weaver  Claude E. Shannon, for his part, was very cautious: \\"The word 'information' has been given different meanings by various writers in the general field of information theory. It is likely that at least a number of these will prove sufficiently useful in certain applications to deserve further study and permanent recognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of information would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible applications of this general field.\\" (Shannon 1993, p. 180). Thus, following Shannon, Weaver supported a tripartite analysis of information in terms of (1) technical problems concerning the quantification of information and dealt with by Shannon's theory; (2) semantic problems relating to meaning and truth; and (3) what he called \\"influential\\" problems concerning the impact and effectiveness of information on human behaviour, which he thought had to play an equally important role. And these are only two early examples of the problems raised by any analysis of information. A map of the main senses in which one may speak of information is provided by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article. The previous paragraphs are based on it. Bateson Gregory Bateson defined information as \\"a difference that makes a difference\\".Extract from \\"Steps to an Ecology of Mind\\" which is based on Donald M. MacKay: information is a distinction that makes a difference.The Philosophy of Information. Luciano Floridi. Chapter 4. Oxford University Press, USA (March 8, 2011) ASIN: 0199232385 Floridi According to Luciano Floridi, four kinds of mutually compatible phenomena are commonly referred to as \\"information\\": * Information about something (e.g. a train timetable) * Information as something (e.g. DNA, or fingerprints) * Information for something (e.g. algorithms or instructions) * Information in something (e.g. a pattern or a constraint). The word \\"information\\" is commonly used so metaphorically or so abstractly that the meaning is unclear. Philosophical directions Computing and philosophy Recent creative advances and efforts in computing, such as semantic web, ontology engineering, knowledge engineering, and modern artificial intelligence provide philosophy with fertile ideas, new and evolving subject matters, methodologies, and models for philosophical inquiry. While computer science brings new opportunities and challenges to traditional philosophical studies, and changes the ways philosophers understand foundational concepts in philosophy, further major progress in computer science would only be feasible when philosophy provides sound foundations for areas such as bioinformatics, software engineering, knowledge engineering, and ontologies. Classical topics in philosophy, namely, mind, consciousness, experience, reasoning, knowledge, truth, morality and creativity are rapidly becoming common concerns and foci of investigation in computer science, e.g., in areas such as agent computing, software agents, and intelligent mobile agent technologies. According to Luciano Floridi \\"Luciano Floridi, Open Problems in the Philosophy of Information Metaphilosophy 35.4, 554-582. Revised version of The Herbert A. Simon Lecture on Computing and Philosophy given at Carnegie Mellon University in 2001, with RealVideo one can think of several ways for applying computational methods towards philosophical matters: # Conceptual experiments in silico: As an innovative extension of an ancient tradition of thought experiment, a trend has begun in philosophy to apply computational modeling schemes to questions in logic, epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of biology, philosophy of mind, and so on. # Pancomputationalism: On this view, computational and informational concepts are considered to be so powerful that given the right level of abstraction, anything in the world could be modeled and represented as a computational system, and any process could be simulated computationally. Then, however, pancomputationalists have the hard task of providing credible answers to the following two questions: ## how can one avoid blurring all differences among systems? ## what would it mean for the system under investigation not to be an informational system (or a computational system, if computation is the same as information processing)? Information and society Numerous philosophers and other thinkers have carried out philosophical studies of the social and cultural aspects of electronically mediated information. * Albert Borgmann, Holding onto Reality: The Nature of Information at the Turn of the Millennium (Chicago University Press, 1999) * Mark Poster, The Mode of Information (Chicago Press, 1990) * Luciano Floridi, \\"The Informational Nature of Reality\\", Fourth International European Conference on Computing and Philosophy 2006 (Dragvoll Campus, NTNU Norwegian University for Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, 22‚Äì24 June 2006).

It was founded by Johannes Cornelis Goosen, who was born in the Klein Drakenstein and came to the Warm Bokkeveld as a young farmer. In March 1851 Goosen bought the farm Wagenbooms Rivier from George Sebastiaan Wolfaardt at the ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù price of ¬£6 000. Ten years later he measured out first 80 and then another 10 plots and sold them for ¬£6 000 each. These plots had water rights and each owner also received one morgen or of land to cultivate in the Bakoven River to grow feed for their animals. While Goosen was busy measuring out his plots, Queen Victoria's son Prince Alfred visited the Cape Colony. Goosen decided to name the new town after the Prince and so the name Prince Alfred Hamlet was born. In 1861 the first school was established with 42 pupils under the tutorship of Master Strobos. The building, a temporary construction, was known as the ‚ÄúHouse on Sticks‚Äù. In 1871 the ‚ÄúHouse on Sticks‚Äù was demolished when a permanent building became available. It was also used as the church. In 1906 the Prince Alfred Hamlet members of the Ceres Dutch Reformed Church decided to build their own church. D.G. Roux laid the cornerstone on 5 May 1906. Each member had to help by donating a delivery of the stones and each family bought its own pew. In 1926 a parsonage was built so that a full-time minister could be appointed to serve this congregation. On 5 November 1954 they broke away from Ceres ‚ÄúMother‚Äù Church and Rev. I.B. Fourie took up the position of minister of the independent parish. On 25 April 1964 Fourie laid the cornerstone of the new church. The new building was opened on 14 and 15 November and the old building was converted into a hall. A Dutch Reformed Mission Church, i.e. a separate church for Coloured people, was established in 1965 and a church was built. The first minister was J. Marais. This church, as well as many other old houses, did not survive the earthquake of 1969. On 10 April 1929 Prince Alfred Hamlet got its own train station.Statement Showing, in Chronological Order, the Date of Opening and the Mileage of Each Section of Railway, Statement No. 19, p. 189, ref. no. 200954-13 The Minister of Railways, W.C. Malan, applied the last bolt to the line before the train, filled with school children, left Ceres for the ceremony at Hamlet. A Town Council was inaugurated on 8 December 1874 and on 28 December 1910 the town was given the status of Municipality under the Municipality Law of 1882. In 1926 a Town Hall was built and in 1979 the offices next to it were added. The Hamlet Country Hotel is the oldest business still in operation. Part of the building was constructed in the 19th century and since 1940 the Kahn family has run it.

He is the former senior rabbi of Temple Israel Center in White Plains, New York. Since September 2020, he has served as the Vice Chancellor for Religious Life and Engagement at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America . Education and career A 1967 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, Tucker holds the A.B. degree from Harvard College and a PhD. (in Philosophy) from Princeton University. He was ordained a Rabbi in 1975 by The Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS). He has served on the faculty of JTS since 1976, currently serving as Adjunct Assistant Professor of Jewish philosophy, in addition to his duties as a congregational rabbi. From 1984 to 1992 he served as dean of the Rabbinical School at JTS. He subsequently became rabbi of Temple Israel Center in White Plains, New York, following the retirement of Rabbi Arnold S. Turetsky. Tucker has served as Chairman of the Board of the Masorti Foundation for Conservative Judaism in Israel, and as a member of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly. In 2006, his name was listed as one of the frontrunners for the Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, to replace Chancellor Ismar Schorsch upon his retirement. Arnold Eisen was ultimately chosen for the position.  Philosophy of Conservative Judaism  Tucker, in his writings about the Torah and the nature of divine revelation, is a leader within Conservative Judaism in articulating a position between the traditional view that the Torah is of divine origin, and a secular view, in which the Torah is seen entirely as a work of human creation. He writes, \\"It is the particular characteristic of Conservative Judaism to insist that religious authority is a partnership, that it comes from the reality of a revealing God and the equally inescapable reality of a seeking, evolving community through which God's words get expressed over time.\\" The Torah, according to Tucker, \\"is not a record of commanding utterances from God, but rather a record of the religious quests of a people, and of their understanding of how God‚Äôs will commands them.\\" Tucker's liberalism and interest in philosophy reflect his role in Conservative Judaism as a leading scholar and interpreter of the works of Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907‚Äì1972). Heschel, a rabbi who escaped the Holocaust in Europe through the help of Hebrew Union College and ultimately joined the faculty of Jewish Theological Seminary, became famous not only for his many religious and philosophical commentaries, but also for his social activism and support of the civil rights movement. In the 1950s and '60s, the two most famous scholars at Jewish Theological Seminary were Heschel and Mordechai Kaplan (1881‚Äì1983). Gordon Tucker began his studies at Jewish Theological Seminary at a time when both Kaplan and Heschel were living. Both Kaplan and Heschel confronted more traditional elements within Conservative Judaism, but each of them sought to redefine Judaism in different ways. While Kaplan favored a positivist, rationalist, and scientific approach to Judaism, Heschel's approach was philosophical, mystical, and spiritual. In effect, Heschel and Kaplan offered competing approaches to the liberalization of Jewish theology. Gordon Tucker's liberalism could be said to reflect Heschel's own political activism. According to Neil Gillman, a historian of Conservative Judaism, \\"Heschel insisted that his turn to political activism was prompted by his experience of living in Europe in the decades before World War II. He had been a personal witness to political oppression and was painfully aware that many otherwise good people stood on the sidelines and did not intervene. He was not going to repeat that pattern in America.\\" Heschel's mystical spirituality lead him to become a champion within American Jewry of liberal causes and political activism. But Tucker is not a follower of Heschel, in the same sense that Kaplan had followers within Conservative Judaism. Rather, he is a follower of what he understands to be Heschel's tradition. For Tucker, Jewish law cannot be expressed solely through a positivist legal framework. It is motivated by an underlying and evolving sense of God's will through a process in which human beings play a critical role. To find precedent for changing Jewish law, Tucker analyzes evolving Jewish moral and legal traditions. Just as Heschel did, he turns to aggadah, the non-legalistic writings that are part of the oral and written tradition of Torah scholarship. He writes that Judaism has developed a precedent over time that rejects \\"the practice of punishing people, and causing them undue suffering, for things they are not responsible for.\\" Ultimately, his proposal for a new halakhic response to homosexuality was based on this precedent.  Proposed takkanah on homosexuality  Tucker's prominence as both a political and theological liberal within Conservative Judaism is reflected in the role he played in the movement's recent debates on the issue of homosexuality. As a member of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS), he authored a proposed teshuvah (responsa) arguing that the biblical prohibition on male homosexuality should be overturned. In doing so, he proposed that the Conservative movement should accept a new, more liberal approach to halakhah (Jewish law). (Tucker originally offered his paper as a responsum, but the committee voted instead to consider it as a takkanah, requiring 13 votes for adoption.) An important difference between Conservative and Orthodox Judaism is that Conservative Judaism empowers modern rabbis to issue takkanot (decrees) modifying Biblical prohibitions, when perceived to be necessary. However, such decrees must be rooted in halakhic process and precedent. Conservative Judaism has adopted takkanot only for a few exceptional matters, such as the abolition of the biblical category of mamzer (a child whose mother is married to a someone other than the biological father or is the product of an incestuous relationship). Orthodox Judaism takes a more limited view as to how law can be changed. Both Conservative and Orthodox Judaism address most questions of Jewish law through responsa, through a written, rabbinical interpretation of Jewish law, analogous to a court decision. In Orthodox Judaism, responsa are the product of individual rabbis, and their authority derives from the recognition of the author within the larger Orthodox community as a posek or decisor. In Conservative Judaism, both responsa and takkanot are products of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, whose voting members are ordained rabbis within the Conservative movement. On December 6, 2006, The CJLS adopted three different responsa, somewhat contradictory, on issues that address the participation of male homosexuals in Conservative Judaism: * By 13 of 25 votes, the minimum majority, the CJLS adopted a responsum authored by Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff, Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner, lifting most restrictions on homosexual conduct and opening the way to the ordination of openly gay and lesbian rabbis and acceptance of homosexual unions, but stopping short of religiously recognizing gay marriage. The responsum maintained the Biblical prohibition on male-male anal sex. * Also by 13 of 25 votes, the committee adopted a traditionalist responsum, by Rabbi Joel Roth, reaffirming a general prohibition on homosexual conduct. * By six votes, the minimum for adoption as a minority position, the committee approved another responsum by Rabbi Leonard Levy, delineating ways in which to ensure that gays and lesbians would be accorded human dignity and a respected place in Conservative communities and institutions while maintaining the authority of the traditional prohibitions against same-sex sexual activity. The Committee rejected Gordon Tucker's takkanah. Details of this issue are discussed in Conservative Halakha. Tucker's proposed takkanah became, in effect, a dissenting opinion.  Translation and commentary on Heschel  Rabbi Tucker's most widely known scholarly work is his translation with notes and commentaries of writings of Abraham Joshua Heschel. Tucker translated Heschel's Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariah shel HaDorot (Heavenly Torah as Refracted through the Generations) from the original Hebrew into English, and provided many notes, essays, and commentaries. In her forward to Heavenly Torah, Heschel's daughter Susannah Heschel describes the scope and magnitude of this translation. \\"Gordon Tucker (and Rabbi Leonard Levin) have done a superb job of assembling, editing, abridging, and translating a huge, not-quite-finished manuscript. Others literally died trying to translate this sprawling masterpiece. There may be some dissent from the inevitable omissions, some few typos, some doubts about Tucker's interpretations. But on the whole, the introductions to each chapter, the explanatory notes on almost every page (including identifying Heschel's often obscure sources) are wonderful aids in working through this massive work.\\" Heschel differed with the more legalistic approach to Torah of the Lithuanian rabbis who dominated the interpretation of halacha and the exegesis of Torah in the 20th century. He emphasized aggadah and midrash, the often speculative writings of the rabbinical sages that were outside the Torah's legal framework. Because these writings were not as heavily edited or redacted as the Mishna and Gemara, Heschel's Hebrew manuscript reflects a variety of difficult Hebrew prose styles. Or N. Rose, a reviewer of Heavenly Torah, praised Tucker and Levin for capturing the qualities of Heschel's original manuscript in their translation. \\"Not only is this English version a lucid and thoughtful reworking of the original text, but Tucker and Levin even manage to introduce into their translation a measure of the poeticism readers have come to expect of Heschel.\\" Family life Tucker is currently married to Dr. Amy Cohn, with whom he has a son and daughter, Micah and Becky. He was previously married to Hadassah Freilich (now Lieberman), with whom he has a son, Rabbi Ethan Tucker, a rosh yeshiva at Yeshivat Hadar. His first wife later married Senator Joseph Lieberman, who became the first Jewish candidate for national office with a major political party.

Logan is best known for having founded The Face, the magazine which forged a new \\"lifestyle\\" sector in British publishing in the 1980s and 1990s. He was editor of the New Musical Express during its 1970s heyday and created a slew of other titles alongside The Face: pop fortnightly Smash Hits, men's magazines Arena, Arena Homme + and Deluxe and women's publication Frank. Early life One of four children born to John and Doris Logan, Nick Logan was brought up in east London neighbourhoods Leytonstone and Wanstead and attended Leyton County High School for Boys.p10, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. He married Julie Hillier (1947-2016) in October 1967 and has three children. Journalism Logan started his career in 1963 as a reporter at the West Essex Gazette & Walthamstow Guardian series of local papers in east London, where he was given responsibility for the pop pages. \\"I might have interviewed the Small Faces, who lived locally, or the drummer of the Nashville Teens, but it was all minor stuff,\\" Logan said later.It Could Only End In Tears, Gareth Ware, DIY Magazine, February 24, 2013 New Musical Express In 1967 Logan joined IPC's NME as one of five staff writers. The weekly was still reliant on the major stars of the earlier part of the decade such as The Beatles, and, as rock music supplanted pop and album sales overtook those of singles, NME lost ground to the rival Melody Maker, also published by IPC. In 1972 IPC's management promoted Logan's colleague Alan Smith to editor and Logan as assistant editor with the brief of overhauling the content and design of the publication. Together they assembled a new editorial team drawn from the ranks of the underground and independently published press including Charles Shaar Murray from Oz and Nick Kent and Pennie Smith from Frendz.p165-172, In Their Own Write: Adventures In the Music Press, Paul Gorman, Sanctuary, 2001. Logan assumed the editorship from Smith in 1973 at the age of 26, becoming the youngest national newspaper editor in the UK. His recruitment of the cream of young British writing talent, including Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons, resulted in the title becoming the pre-eminent music weekly of the period with sales topping 180,000 copies a week. Smash Hits In 1978 Logan left the NME and determined to never again work in a corporate environment. He pitched several magazine ideas to the printing company East Midlands Allied Press, which was developing its magazine division Emap. Among these was the proposal for a colourful teenage pop monthly which was test-marketed in the north-east of England in the autumn of 1978 as Smash Hits. \\"My interest was in featuring excellent photography with song lyrics as ballast and bringing good acts like The Jam to a young audience,\\" Logan said later.p17, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. Encouraged by the test- marketing exercise Emap put the first issue into national circulation; over the next couple of months sales increased to above 100,000 and the publisher reached agreement with Logan to switch to fortnightly publication.p17, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. Smash Hits' circulation rapidly rose to 166,000 copies, just 35,000 fewer than the NME and 10,000 more than Melody Maker,Like Punk Never Happened: Culture Club & The New Pop, Faber & Faber, Dave Rimmer, 1986. but by the autumn of 1979 Logan was ready to move on. Journalist Ian Cranna became editor and Logan, in his role as editorial director, proposed a new magazine - \\"a well-produced, well-designed and well-written monthly with music at its core but with expanding coverage of the subjects that informed it, from fashion and film to nightclubbing and social issues\\".Paul Gorman, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Thames & Hudson, 2017. When Emap's directors passed on the proposal Logan and his wife decided to go it alone and invest ¬£3,500 savings into the new title, which he named The Face.p17, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. The Face  Initially working out of the Smash Hits offices in Carnaby Street, central London, and using the off-the- shelf corporate entity Wagadon, which he had formed for his business relationship with Emap, Logan published the first issue of The Face on 1 May 1980. Featuring a logo designed by Steve Bush, with whom Logan had worked on Smash Hits, and a portrait by photographer Chalkie Davies of Jerry Dammers of The Specials on the front cover, this issue sold 56,000 copies.p20, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. Sales levelled over the next six months, but a fillip was provided by alliance with what would become London's New Romantic scene via articles written by young journalist Robert Elms with photographs by Derek Ridgers, Virginia Turbett and others.pp22-27, The Cult With No Name, Robert Elms, The Face, November 1980 The publication of lookalike rivals such as New Sounds, New Styles and Blitz and the launch of i-D magazine confirmed Logan had established a new publishing sector. He moved into the first of a series of offices of his own in central London. Subsequently, Logan recruited young designer Neville Brody as art director in 1981, placing the magazine ahead of the pack visually. Brody drew on such early 20th century art and design movements as Constructivism to create a stark new visual language which would define certain visual aspects of 1980s Britain.No More Rules: Graphic Design And Post-Modernism, Rock Poynor, Laurence King, 2003. The style pages of The Face meanwhile set the pace for the wider fashion world, particularly those produced by the Buffalo collective, led by stylist Ray Petri and including photographer Jamie Morgan. In the 1980s Logan's innovations at The Face included the November 1983 \\"New Life In Europe\\" issue, a co-production with nine continental European magazines including France's Actuel, and the 100th edition of September 1988 which incorporated a tri-fold on the front which featured the covers of every magazine published thus far. In 1990, shortly before being awarded the inaugural Marcus Morris Award for magazine innovation, Logan was diagnosed with cancer of the jaw and forced to take a nine-month sabbatical from work. On recovery he became editorial director at Wagadon, with Sheryl Garratt as editor of The Face and Dylan Jones editing Arena. In this period art director Phil Bicker, who had succeeded Neville Brody and Robin Derrick, actively pursued working relationships with young experimental photographers, including Corinne Day, Stephane Sednaoui, Nigel Shafran and David Sims, as well as stylists such as Melanie Ward. Bicker's decision to make the unknown 16-year-old Kate Moss \\"the face of The Face\\" gave the supermodel her first exposure, particularly on the front of the July 1990 issue entitled \\"The 3rd Summer Of Love\\".p196, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. In May 1992, a High Court jury found in favour of a libel claim by Jason Donovan that The Face had imputed he was gay when he was not and awarded the pop performer ¬£200,000 in damages and costs. The singer later reduced the amount to ¬£95,000 to be paid over several months and a fund was set up for readers and supporters. Under Sheryl Garratt's direction with assistance from her successor Richard Benson and other writers including Lindsay Baker, Ashley Heath, Gavin Hills and Amy Raphael, The Face reflected the developments in club culture, fashion and what became known as Britart as well as musical genres such as jungle and Britpop. By this time the magazine's art direction and design team of Stuart Spalding and Lee Swillingham were showcasing such emerging photographic talents as Inez and Vinoodh and Norbert Schoerner. The biggest selling issue of The Face was published in October 1995. With Robbie Williams on the cover, it sold 128,000 copies.p289, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. After Logan launched new titles Frank and Deluxe, Richard Benson became editorial director of Wagadon in 1998. His successor as editor of The Face was Adam Higginbotham who in turn was succeeded by Johnny Davis in spring 1999. In July 1999 amid plummeting circulation figures and aggressive competition from such titles as Loaded and Dazed & Confused, Logan sold Wagadon to Emap, which absorbed The Face, Arena and Arena Homme + into its lifestyle division The Face at Emap  While Benson did not join Emap, Johnny Davis and Ashley Heath were among the team who made the transfer. In 2002 Davis was succeeded as editor by Neil Stevenson, co-founder of the Popbitch gossip website. By the spring of 2004 monthly sales had slipped to 40,000 copies and Emap consumer division head Paul Keenan announced the magazine's closure.p342, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. The final issue was published in May 2004. Arena In autumn 1986 Logan published the first issue of pioneering men's magazine Arena; he was editor, with Dylan Jones, who had previously been at i-D, as assistant editor, Neville Brody as art director and Steve Taylor as contributing editor. Arena was initially a biannual before becoming a quarterly. Later it was published 10 times a year. Dylan Jones succeeded Logan as editor in 1990 and Robin Derrick became art editor. Kathryn Flett assumed the role of editor of Arena from 1992 to 1995 and was succeeded by Peter Howarth. Ekow Eshun moved across from The Face to take Howarth's place in February 1997 until the sale of Wagadon in July 1999. The last issue of Arena was published in 2009.Media Talk Extra: Nick Logan, The Guardian, March 6, 2009 Frank Pitched as \\"an intelligent women's magazine\\", Logan published the first issue of Frank in September 1997 having appointed Tina Gaudoin as editor with Lisa Markwell as deputy editor and Harriet Quick as features editor. The first issue sold 120,000 copies and Gaudoin told the trade press that the publication would \\"fill the niche for the disenfranchised 25-year-old reader\\".Profile: A Frank Examination Of The Facts, Karen Dempsey, PR Week, September 5, 1997 Frank failed to gain a toehold in the highly competitive market and after staff departures and office in-fighting Logan shuttered the magazine in the spring of 1999.p315, The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture, Paul Gorman, Thames & Hudson, 2017. Latterly, the magazine has been seen to have pioneered more thoughtful and unpatronising journalism for women. Writer Lou Stoppard has declared Frank \\"really ahead of its time\\".http://showstudio.com/project/print/frank_harriet_quick Deluxe Deluxe was conceived as a more sophisticated magazine for young men who were then being targeted with such \\"New Lad\\" titles as FHM, Loaded and Maxim, based on a proposal by Andrew Harrison, a contributor to The Face who Logan appointed editor. \\"Deluxe is here because a group of people got tired of being told that the same clapped-out subjects were the be-all and end-all of men's interests,\\" announced Harrison prior to the publication of the first issue in May 1998.Wagadon's Deluxe Set For Men's Mid Market, Anna Griffiths, Campaign, March 20, 1998 Deluxe failed to achieve circulation close to the 150,000 target that had been set for it.

Between 2012 and 2017 Logan worked with author Paul Gorman on his book The Story Of The Face: The Magazine That Changed Culture.

In contrast to the rest of the musical, \\"The Farmer and the Cowman\\" does not further the plot but does allow the audience to witness the tension between the farmers and the cowmen, a tension that comes from the farmers' desire to protect their crops with fences while the cowmen prefer the freedom to move cattle over a wide open range. Carnes, Aunt Eller and Ike act as peacemakers and attempt to reconcile the two sides. The song appears to have no effect, and the two sides start fighting.

He was part of a parliamentary group which traveled to Spain to congratulate Francisco Franco on his fight against the Spanish Popular Front. Tixier- Vignancour married Janine Auriol in January 1938, the daughter of a lawyer and member of parliament for Haute-Garonne. Enlisted in the army in 1939, he took part in fights near Beuvraignes during the Battle of France in 1940, before voting for the law that gave full powers (pleins pouvoirs) to Philippe P√©tain on July, 10 of the same year. On 6 October 1940, in charge of \\"applying the instructions of the armistice commission\\", he confirmed the interdiction of movies like The Great Illusion or Entente cordiale, accused of \\"incitement to hatred against Germany\\". Tixier-Vignancour served as the under-Secretary of State for Information under Nazi-collaborationist Vichy France and as director of P√©tain‚Äôs \\"Propaganda Committee\\". As the head of Radio-Vichy, he offered a large broadcast time to collaborationist Marcel D√©at. On 20 July 1941, he was interned in Vals-les-Bains after he decided to move away from the Vichy regime, and in December managed to flee to Tunisia. In early November 1942, the Allies invaded the German-occupied Maghreb during Operation Torch, and Tixier-Vignancour was arrested then interned again, that time by the German authorities. He was released following the ejection of the Axis powers from North Africa by the Allies in May 1943. After his liberation, Tixier- Vignancour unsuccessfully tried to join the French Expeditionary Corps in Italy. Caught up with his collaborationist past, he was quickly arrested by the French Committee of National Liberation and declared ineligible to hold public office for ten years on 4 December 1945. In 1948, Tixier-Vignancour became the lawyer of French novelist Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, accused of \\"collaboration with the enemy\\" for his antisemitic and pro-occupation writings. He obtained C√©line's amnesty on 26 April 1951, after he presented his client under his real name, Louis-Ferdinand Destouches, with no judge able to draw a relationship between Destouches and his pen name, C√©line. While waiting for his electoral ban period to end, Tixier-Vignancou joined the neo- fascist party Jeune Nation soon after its creation in 1949. He helped Maurice Bard√®che establish the magazine D√©fense de l'Occident (an important arena for the discussion of right-wing ideas and Holocaust denial text) and the neo- fascist coalition European Social Movement in 1951-52.  Amnesty and Algerian war (1953‚Äì1962)  Tixier-Vignancour was granted amnesty in 1953 and became once again able to run for public office. Opposing the use of street violence promoted by Jeune Nation, he left the group to found his own party with Bard√®che in May 1954: the Rassemblement National Fran√ßais. Re-elected in the department of Basses-Pyr√©n√©es, Tixier-Vignancour served as a Non-Inscrit (\\"non-attached member\\") in the National Assembly between January 1956 and December 1958, where he allied himself with the Poujadists. Following the May 1958 crisis and the return of Charles de Gaulle to power, he refused to vote a law that would temporarily authorize the president to revise the constitution until a referendum occurs on a new one. Tixier-Vignancour declared ironically in parliament: \\"I would never have thought that, twice in my life, I will be asked to delegate the fraction of constituting power I held, and‚Äîeven better‚Äînever would I have imagined that, for the second time, the man who asks for it will be the very same man who punished me for having delegated this power a first time.\\" The Fifth Republic was eventually established on 4 October 1958, approved by 82% of the French in September. On 30 November 1958, Tixier-Vignancour lost his siege to a Radical candidate in the first legislative elections of the new regime. After the dissolution of Jeune Nation by official decree earlier that year, he wrote articles for the group's magazine, launched on 5 July 1958 as an attempt to revive the banned movement. Opposed to decolonization and independence during the Algerian war (1954-1962), Tixier-Vignancour was, along with Jean-Marie Le Pen, one of the founders of the National Front for French Algeria (Front National pour l'Alg√©rie Fran√ßaise) in July 1960. As a lawyer, he defended Raoul Salan in 1962, the founder of the pro-colonial paramilitary organization OAS and one of the four generals who directed the Algiers putsch of 1961. Salan was spared the death penalty and instead condemned to prison. Tixier-Vignancour‚Äôs defense credited for \\"saving Salan‚Äôs neck\\", this event boosted his standing among nationalists. He served also as a defense counsel for colonel Jean Bastien- Thiry, executed for attempting to assassinate Charles de Gaulle during the of August 1962.  Presidential campaign (1963‚Äì65)  In November 1963, Tixier- Vignancour publicly announced his candidacy for the 1965 presidential election, presenting himself as the \\"militant of all the nationalist parties whichever they may be\\". On 17 July 1964, he established the \\"Tixier-Vignancour committees\\" (comit√©s T.V.), a grassroots movement to support his candidacy for president the following year, with Jean-Marie Le Pen as a campaign director. Some 80 local \\"comit√©s T.V.\\" were set up throughout France and the Comit√© Jeunes (\\"Youth Committee\\"), directed by Roger Holeindre and supported by the group Occident, quickly attracted several hundred members. The first meeting in Paris gathered some 4,000 militants and led to violent clashes between Occident and the police. After a disagreement between Le Pen and Occident's founder Pierre Sidos, the movement was replaced with Dominique Venner's Europe-Action volunteers, despite their own initial skepticism regarding Tixier-Vignancour‚Äôs candidacy. Tixier-Vignancour managed to rally diverse leanings that existed within the far-right, all united against Gaullism: the young revolutionaries of Occident and Europe-Action were present, along with \\"those nostalgic for Vichy, descendants of Action Fran√ßaise, fundamentalist Catholics, Alg√©rie fran√ßaise ultras, the residue of Poujadism, embryonic fascists, and representatives of the liberal right\\". Despite his conservative stance, the then president Charles de Gaulle embodied in their eyes \\"‚Äòthe loss of Algeria, the end of the Empire, the weakening of the army, and closer ties with the communist world.\\" At the height of the campaign, Le Pen and Tixier- Vignancour even went to London to meet members of the British Conservative Party and potentially use it as an example for a new conservative-nationalist party in France. Tixier-Vignancour's movement participated in the municipal elections of March 1965 and received 9.6% of the votes in Paris. This encouraging result was followed, in the summer of 1965, by poll predictions crediting Tixier-Vignancour with 19% of the presidential vote. The latter began to imagine a first-round score of up to 25%, and a victory in the second round. Acting as if he was already president, Tixier-Vignancour traveled during the campaign to Saigon, Bonn, Rome and London. He abandoned his radical far-right rhetoric to court the moderate right, his campaign managers labeling him the \\"national and liberal opposition\\" against the extremist Charles de Gaulle. A former Vichy collaborator, Tixier-Vignancour yet invoked the name of French WWII resister Jean Moulin to serve his campaign. Despite this calculated attempts at moderating his positions, commentators portrayed Tixier-Vignancour as \\"the alliance of Alg√©rie fran√ßaise, Poujadism and the spirit of Vichy\\", and he was only endorsed in the media by the radical right- wing press: Rivarol, Europe-Action, Aspects de la France and Minute. Supported by a disparate and sometimes hostile alliance of far-rights groups, and lacking the necessary party structure, Tixier-Vignancour's failed at 5.2% of the votes in December 1965. After that, he publicly called for a vote in favor of Socialist candidate Fran√ßois Mitterrand in the second round. Deceived by his multiple renunciations‚Äîfrom the moderation of stance to his support of Mitterrand‚Äî, Le Pen decided to quit the campaign. Votes for Tixier-Vignancour were heavily concentrated in the south of France, a region which had already seen the highest levels of \\"no\\" votes in the √âvian Agreements referendum and where many Pieds-noirs had settled after their recent repatriation from Algeria in 1962.  Later life (1966‚Äì1989)  Tixier-Vignancour participated in a pro-Israel demonstration in 1967 in Paris during the Six-Day War. During the May 1968 crisis, he endorsed re-elected president De Gaulle to put an end to the general disorder. In the 1969 presidential election, he supported Gaullist candidate Georges Pompidou. He was the main instigator in the of February 1973. He joined the far-right Party of New Forces (PFN) in June 1978, of which he became the honorary president and spokesman. In 1979, he unsuccessfully ran for the PFN in the European elections and eventually left the party in February 1982. He died on 17 September 1989 at 81 in Paris. His funeral was celebrated in Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet church, a stronghold of the Christian traditionalist Society of Saint Pius X.  Views  Strongly anti-communist, he endorsed during his 1965 campaign the NATO military and nuclear alliance with the United States, to defend the \\"humanist and Christian West\\" against \\"communism and its Trojan horse, Gaullism\\". Arguing that France should reduce development aid towards its former colonies, he coined the slogan \\"la Corr√®ze passe avant le Zamb√®ze\\" (\\"Corr√®ze comes before the Zambezi\\"). Tixier-Vignancour was also fervently opposed to immigration, labeling himself a supporter of \\"French Algeria\\" rather than \\"Algerian France\\". He argued for \\"strict and rigorously selected quotas\\" for Algerian immigrants to \\"avoid the invasion of France by a multitude of starving mouths, undesirables and invalids with no technical or social education\\".  Private life  Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour was the godfather of Jean-Marie Le Pen's daughter Caroline.

The battalion served in the Vietnam War; the Invasion of Grenada; the Invasion of Panama; Desert Storm; the Invasion of Afghanistan; and the Invasion of Iraq. Additionally, Company A served in the Korean War prior to the formation of the battalion as the 523d Military Intelligence Company. History The 519th Military Intelligence Battalion was activated on 15 October 1948 at Fort Riley, Kansas. Elements of the battalion served in the Republic of Korea from 1951 until 1954, participating in seven campaigns and earning one Meritorious Unit Commendation and two Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations. The battalion was inactivated in 1954. On 25 January 1958, the 519th Military Intelligence (MI) Battalion (BN) (Airborne (ABN)) was reactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In May 1965, the 519th MI BN (ABN) deployed to the Dominican Republic for Operation Powerpack, where it supported the 82nd Airborne Division and the U.S. Marines in combating the Communist insurgency on the Caribbean island. In late summer of 1965 the 519th MI BN redeployed back to FT Bragg, NC and deployed to the Republic of Vietnam in November 1965. During the Vietnam War, the battalion again left the United States and distinguished itself by participating in sixteen campaigns and earning three Meritorious Unit Commendations. In 1972, the battalion returned to Fort Bragg. After several reorganizations, the battalion officially achieved a three-company configuration in September 1978, with Headquarters, Headquarters & Service Company; Company A (Interrogation); and Company B (Counterintelligence). In April 1981, the Forces Command Intelligence Training Detachment (FITD) was attached to the battalion, bringing with it the mission of training Army Reserve and National Guard units throughout the United States. On 16 April 1982, the battalion was reorganized and redesignated the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion (Tactical Exploitation) (Airborne), resulting in the activation of Company C (Electronic Warfare). Since then the battalion has reorganized one more time. In 1995, Company C was deactivated and Company F, 51st Infantry (Long Range Surveillance) was assigned to the battalion to provide the Corps with long range surveillance capability. About 2007, during the reconfiguration of the 525th MI Brigade to a Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BFSB), Company F, 51st Infantry was redesignated C Troop (ABN), 1st Squadron, 38th Cavalry Regiment (1-38th CAV) and was removed from the control of the 519th MI BN and reassigned to 1-38th CAV, which is another subordinate battalion in the 525th BFSB. Subsequently, C Co. 519th MI BN was reactivated as a line company in the 519th MI BN. The battalion participated in combat operations in Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury) in November 1983, Panama (Operation Just Cause) in December 1989, and in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) (Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm) and was subordinate to the 525th MI Brigade (CEWI) (ABN), as part of the XVIII Airborne Corps, under Third US Army during the deployment in the KTO from August 1990 to March 1991. During the 1990s, the 519th MI BN participated in Peace Keeping Operations in Haiti (Operation Restore Democracy), Bosnia (Operations Joint Endeavor and Joint Forge) and Kosovo (Operation Joint Guardian). The 519th MI BN also deployed individual Tactical Human Intelligence Teams to Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope. The 519th Military Intelligence Battalion is a subordinate unit of the 525th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, provides tactical HUMINT, long range reconnaissance and surveillance, counterintelligence, interrogation, multi-functional collection and exploitation, and SIGINT support within assigned areas of the Division, Corps, Joint Task Force (JTF) or Multi-National Force area of operations. During the Global War on Terrorism, 519th MI BN has repeatedly deployed for combat operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq. The 519th MI BN served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) I, OEF III, OEF IV, Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) I, OIF IV, and OEF XII and has continued to distinguish itself as one of the elite intelligence battalions in the military. \\"Always Out Front\\"! The battalion redeployed back to FT Bragg, NC after serving in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom XI, from July 2010 to July 2011, under the command of LTC Anthony \\"Tony\\" Hale as part of Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) 101. While in Afghanistan, the 519th MI Battalion was headquartered out of Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, with its units deployed throughout Regional Command East. The 519th MI BN is commanded by LTC Kevin McAninch, who assumed command on 4 August 2011 from LTC (P) Tony Hale. Unit organization The battalion has undergone various reorganizations. In addition to a headquarters company it has contained: * Company A -- interrogation; * Company B -- counter-intelligence; * Company C -- electronic warfare (deactivated); (in Vietnam this was Field Operations Intelligence/Collection not EW) * Training company‚Äîthe Forces Command Intelligence Training Detachment‚Äîtrains reservists; * Company F -- 51 Infantry Long Range Surveillance Company * 45th Military Intelligence Company -- order of battle analysis and imagery interpretation (in Vietnam provided intelligence analysts to the Combined Intelligence Center, Vietnam (CICV) and the Combined Material Exploitation Center (CMEC), deactivated March 1973) Recent controversies Bagram torture and prisoner abuse A platoon of Company A of the 519th, under the command of then Lieutenant Carolyn Wood was implicated in the use of unauthorized interrogation techniques, physical abuse, sexual abuse and the deaths in custody of captives during the fall of 2002. Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Wood was promoted to captain and placed in command of Company A in 2003 prior to the assignment of the company to lead the interrogations at Abu Ghraib. According to the Fay Report Wood played a key role in the importation of extended interrogation techniques the Bush Administration had claimed could be used against illegal combatants in Afghanistan to Iraq where prisoners were still entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions. Personnel in Company A were implicated in the sexual abuse of captives, and were alleged to have provided guidance to military police to abuse prisoners to soften them up for interrogation.

One of the last acts of the Humberside County Council was to build a new footpath bridge over the West Beck. The bridge is a fixed structure, but has a high headroom. A mistake in the location of the bridge means that it lands on private property, and is dangerously close to the river. Since no further money is available the bridge has remained closed since its construction. In 1823 Emmotland was in the parish of Frodingham and the Wapentake and Liberty of Holderness.

It was directed by Hiroshi Shidara and written by Shiro Jinbo. It was greatly successful in the West, particularly in Europe and in Latin America, as well as in Japan. An edited English-language dub of a few episodes titled Angel made this series one of, if not the first, magical girl anime works to reach the United States and Canada, well over a decade before Sailor Moon. A movie adaptation, Hana no Ko Runrun Konnichiwa Sakura no Sono, was released on March 1980. In 2009, William Winckler Productions produced two all-new English-dubbed movie versions edited from the original series titled Lun Lun the Flower Girl and Lun Lun the Flower Girl 2. Producer William Winckler, known for Tekkaman the Space Knight, wrote, produced and directed the English films, which are seen on broadband in Japan. Story Long ago, plant spirits and fairy-like creatures lived in harmony with mankind. Gradually humans began to rise toward greed and cruelty, and the plant spirits immigrated to another world they dubbed the \\"Flower Star.\\" However, their legacy remained in people who truly knew the meaning of love and kindness. A talking dog and cat pair, Nouveau and Cateau, were sent to Earth to find one such person to find a magical flower ‚Äî the symbol of the Flowern Star's ruling family ‚Äî so that a new ruler can ascend the throne. In France they meet Lunlun Flower, a tomboyish and outspoken young orphan who lives with her paternal grandparents who own a flower shop. Lunlun's late mother turns out to be a descendant of the Flower star people, so at Lunlun's 15th birthday party they ask Lunlun to join them, and she accepts. They travel all over Europe in search of the flower, helping people every step of the way. Lunlun, Nouveau and Cateau are followed by a bumbling pair of villains: the selfish fairy Togenishia and her servant Yabouki, who want to steal the flower and rule the Flowern Star. Whenever Lunlun and her friends attempt to help people, Togenishia and Yabouki try to get them back on the road by force, only to fail. They're aided by Serge, a mysterious photographer who gives the people Lunlun helps packets of flower seeds which symbolize the lesson they've learned in the \\"language of flowers.\\" (For instance, thistles, which signify independence, are given when the son of a farmer vows to follow his dreams and leave home). Lunlun develops a huge crush on Serge due to his kindness, and he's implied to like her back. The people that Lunlun help send flower seeds to Lunlun's grandparents and tell them about their amazing granddaughter... and, in the end, the magical flower is found growing in his garden, and saving it from destruction after an attack from Togenishia. The photographer Serge turns out to be the prince of the Flower Star, and he confirms that he loves Lunlun and asks her to be his Queen. Lunlun rejects his proposal, however, since she loves Serge with all of her heart but does not want to live in the Star Flower. So Serge cedes the throne to his younger brother so he can live on Earth and marry Lunlun. At the start of the series, Lunlun is given a magical pin from the King of the Flower Planet. This pin, when a flower is reflected in its mirror, gives Lunlun a new outfit for an activity, such as mountain climbing. About halfway through the series, the pin is broken when Lunlun falls from a branch overhanging a waterfall while trying to attract attention after being caught in the Dark Wind (Togenishia's main form of attack). While she is lost in the river, a new pin is given to her in the shape of the royal crest, with the warning that if it is ever lost or broken, her life on Earth will end and she will be unable to return to the Flower Planet. The words to activate this pin are \\"Fu Flay Lu Fey Lora\\".

At least the first four episodes were dubbed into English, with a new theme song and score by house composer Mark Mercury. In this incarnation, the characters were renamed to Angel (Lunlun), Cathy (Cateau), Wendal (Nouveau), Melicia (Togenishia) and Ivan (Yabouki). The episodes were then packaged into one presentation in 1981, which aired on HBO and was released on videocassette by Media Home Entertainment as Angel and by Family Home Entertainment as Flower Angel. The ZIV dub was released on DVD as part of the Fairy Tale Adventures compilation from TCG Direct in 2009. In 1985, ZIV licensed their rights to Harmony Gold, who prepared a feature-film length condensation of the series with another new dub track and music score. Again, the characters were renamed, this time to Angel (Lunlun), Lily (Cateau), Periwinkle (Nouveau), Princess Wysteria (Togenishia), Ragweed (Yabouki) and Stefan (Serge Flora). The episodes that were featured in the film were episodes 1, 7, 24, 29, 49 and 50. The 37th episode was also covered, but it was only the intro to coincide with the beginning events of the 49th episode. This film was not released in America, but received multiple VHS releases in the UK.  Reception  In 2005, Japanese television network TV Asahi conducted an online web poll for the top 100 anime, and Hana no Ko Lunlun placed 85th tied with Ikky≈´-san.

Twenty-five years later, university lecturer Charles Bigelow (Paul Le Mat) learns that his ex-wife, Margaret Newman (Diana Scarwid), has disappeared while attending her mother's funeral in Centerville, and travels there to find her. The disguised aliens all appear human and the town of Centerville appears to have not progressed beyond 1958. The aliens try to capture Bigelow as he escapes, but only capture his dog, Louie. Seeing a photo of an alien in a tabloid magazine, Bigelow soon finds Margaret, who is now revealed to be one of the aliens. She warns Bigelow to escape with Elizabeth (Lulu Sylbert), their human/alien hybrid daughter, to protect her from the aliens, who want to take her to their home-world. Bigelow and Elizabeth escape from the departing alien ship and the townsfolk's blue orbs are transformed back to their original human forms.

The first image Laughlin came up with was that of a midwest landscape with an \\"old-fashioned mothership sliding in\\". He wrote the first few pages himself and then he and Condon completed the screenplay in two parts, each writing different sections. They wrote the script without any deal in place but were confident that it was going to be made into a film. They even figured out the budget, scouted locations, cast the actors, and worked on the production design while arranging the financing. This pre-production was all done at the expense of Condon and Laughlin. The film was a take-off of science fiction films of the 1950s. \\"I think that's when all this science- fiction view of the future was invented - the current idea of the future,\\" said Laughlin. \\"America thought it had conquered the world. The Germans were no longer anything to worry about. The Japanese had been defeated. The only thing that sent a possible tingle through your spine was an invasion from outer space.\\"AT THE MOVIES Gelder, Lawrence Van. New York Times15 Oct 1982: C.8. To help produce the film, Laughlin brought in his friend Walter Coblenz, who had been the assistant director on the Laughlin-produced film Two-Lane Blacktop. They shopped the script for Strange Invaders around Hollywood. Financing Laughlin's previous film, Strange Behavior, had been released by a small distributor and this time around he wanted his film to be handled by a major. Orion Pictures liked the script and was looking for a good film at a modest price with mainstream appeal. Orion provided half of the film's $5.5 million budget with England's EMI Films coming up with the rest. Orion received distribution rights for North America while EMI handled the rest of the world. As part of the financing deal, Orion and EMI demanded several script changes, which Condon and Laughlin found difficult, because they had to try to explain their ideas verbally. The financial backers influence reduced the film's scope. For example, in the original script, the American government was a much bigger threat, with a big sequence taking place at an Air Force base. These changes bothered Laughlin, because they resulted in a lack of a well-defined middle section in the script.Swires 1983, p. 61. Orion and EMI also influenced the casting process and approved every choice Laughlin made. The original script was written with Michael Murphy in mind ‚Äî he had been in Strange Behavior ‚Äî but EMI refused to allow him to be cast much to the director's confusion \\"because there didn't seem to be a good reason for his rejection. I guess it was a matter of personal taste\\". Orion and EMI suggested Mel Gibson and Powers Boothe instead but Laughlin's choice was Paul Le Mat, because he had not played that kind of role before and had a \\"Joel McCrea quality\\" that he was seeking. For the role of Betty, Laughlin wanted an actress from New York and not someone from California playing a New Yorker. Condon was a big fan of Brian De Palma's films and Nancy Allen who appeared in several of them. Louise Fletcher's government agent was originally written as a man, a \\"Bob Balaban bureaucrat\\", but during the screenwriting process, Condon and Laughlin decided to change the character to a woman and cast Fletcher who had been in Strange Behavior. Condon and Laughlin created a visual plan in advance and this helped them shoot the film quickly ‚Äî in only five weeks.Swires 1983, p. 62. Laughlin was helped out by a second unit that worked on the film's visual and prosthetic effects. He hired Private Stock Effects to work on the visual effects. They had previously worked on Battle Beyond the Stars and Escape from New York. For the prosthetic alien effects, he hired James Cummins, a veteran of the John Carpenter film The Thing, and later, the writer and director of the cult horror classic The Boneyard, who had his name removed from the credits after heated debates with Laughlin about the way the effects were being used and shot. Laughlin relented and allowed Cummins to reshoot a lengthy scene near the end of the film where the aliens shed their human guises as they prepare to embark on a 1950s style spacecraft. Laughlin planned a third film in a proposed \\"Strange Trilogy\\", titled, The Adventures of Philip Strange, a World War II spy thriller with science fiction elements and hoped to cast many of the same actors and crew from his two previous films.Swires 1983, p. 63. Reception In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it, \\"a tasteful monster movie with a terrible secret: it eats other movies\\". Newsweek magazine's David Ansen wrote, \\"Hovering unclassifiably between nostalgia and satire, this amiably hip genre movie confirms Laughlin as a deliberately minor but unique stylist. It's up to the viewer to determine just how faux his naif style is, but either way you choose to take it, Strange Invaders offers a good deal of laid-back fun\\". Jay Scott in his review for The Globe and Mail wrote, \\"Strange Invaders is a pastiche, a film-school jumble of aphorisms and winks at the audience that are neither as knowing nor as amusing as they are meant to be\\". Box Office The film was a box office disappointment.'PANTHER'S' EDWARDS SUES MGM/UA: FILM CLIPS London, Michael. Los Angeles Times 28 Sep 1983: g1.

He represented the Denmark national football team at the 1908, 1912 and 1920 Summer Olympics, winning silver medals in 1908 and 1912. He was the first ever goalscorer for the Danish national football team, when he scored in Denmark's debut game at the 1908 Summer Olympics. In 1913, he moved abroad to play for English club Chelsea, and became the first foreign player to ever represent the club. Personal life Middelboe was an amateur footballer throughout his career. He was a qualified lawyer and during his time at Chelsea he was employed at a bank in London. He would have gained thrice the salary as solely a professional footballer than he did as a banker-cum-amateur footballer, but he was (in his own words) \\"by no means mad about football\\". So as not to interfere with his career, Middelboe played in all home games, but was not required to travel to away games while at Chelsea. Middelboe was a man of great height for his time (standing at 6 foot 2 inches), which led to the media naming him \\"The Great Dane\\". He was also well respected as a gentleman of the game. He is buried in the Cemetery of Holmen in Copenhagen. Career Middelboe was born in Brunnby, Sweden. He made his senior debut for Kj√∏benhavns Boldklub (KB) in 1903, at the age of 16. At KB, he played alongside his older brothers Einar Middelboe and Kristian Middelboe, of whom Kristian also played for the Danish national team. From 1904 to 1913 Nils won five KBU football championships with KB, while he also excelled in athletics competitions. He was a Danish triple jump and 4 x 100 metres relay champion, and he set Danish records in the 800 metres (with a time of 2:05.2) and triple jump (13.29 m).

Occupying the half-back role, he won silver medals with Denmark in both the 1908 and 1912 Olympic Games, the latter as captain of the side. His goal against France in 1908 was the first ever goal scored by an official national team in Olympic football. Middelboe won his 11th cap for Denmark in a friendly against Sweden, at the time this made him Denmark's all-time leading appearance maker. In all, he played 15 games and scored 7 goals for the Danish national team from 1908 to 1920. The three times Middelboe played for his country while at Chelsea, he always represented KB, as opposed to Chelsea. Nils Middelboe is renowned as the first non-British international to play for Chelsea, during his stint at the club between 1913 and 1923. Originally he had signed for Newcastle United; however, with the permission of the Newcastle Director, he switched to Chelsea. He made his debut on 15 November 1913 against Derby County at Stamford Bridge - a 2‚Äì1 win for Chelsea. As a show of faith from the players, he was appointed captain, despite never having previously played for the Chelsea first team. In all, he played 46 matches for Chelsea until 1922. After his days at Chelsea, he played for the amateur sides of Corinthian F.C. and Casuals F.C. until 1926. In 1929 he was appointed a Director of the English League Division Three south East London based side Clapton Orient. He returned to Denmark in 1936. It was through Middelboe's contacts in English football, that English coach Edward Magner was hired to coach the Danish national team in 1939. As an interpreter, Middelboe mediated Magner's tactical instructions on the modern WM formation to the team, a formation Middelboe himself was a known critic of. As a coach for KB, he led the team to the Danish football championship in 1940. In April 1946, Chelsea played KB in a friendly, arranged to celebrate that club's 70th anniversary. The chairman of KB announced that, owing to Middelboe's \\"long and happy association\\" with Chelsea, there was no other club they would rather be facing.

Hokusai's One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji includes an image of the small crater at a secondary eruption site on the southwestern slope. This was called Mount H≈çei, because the eruption occurred in the fourth year of H≈çei. Extent of eruption Although it brought no lava flow, the H≈çei eruption released some of volcanic ash, which spread over vast areas around the volcano, even reaching Edo almost away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi provinces.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, p. 416. In Edo, the volcanic ash was several centimetres thick. The eruption is rated a 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The eruption happened on Mount Fuji's east‚Äìnorth-east flank and formed three new volcanic vents, named No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 H≈çei vents. The catastrophe developed over the course of several days; an initial earthquake and explosion of cinders and ash was followed some days later with the more forceful ejections of rocks and stones.Smith, Henry.

Volcanic ash fell and widely covered the cultivated fields east of Mount Fuji. To recover the fields farmers cast volcanic products out to dumping-grounds making piles. The rain washed material from the dumping grounds away to the rivers again and again and made some of the rivers shallower, especially into the , into which huge volumes of ash fell, resulting in temporary dams. Heavy rainfall on 7‚Äì8 August 1708, the year following the H≈çei eruption, caused an avalanche of volcanic ash and mud, breaking the dams and flooding the Ashigara plain.

Founded in 1983, the space closed in late 1985. History 8BC Gallery, exterior view, 1984, from the Archives of American Art In 1980 co-founder Cornelius Conboy purchased the building with the intention of opening a theatre. During his time working on Theatre Row, Conboy became aware of the lack of experimental performance support in the area. He came across the space, a former farmhouse, in an area of the East Village described as \\"Little Dresden\\" due to the large quantity of burnt out and abandoned buildings. He intended the facility as a casual performance-oriented club space rather than a formal theater. His partner in the venture was Dennis Gattra, a member of a traveling circus and road manager for The Flying Karamazov Brothers. The space opened on October 31, 1983, with Ucci's Circus Romanus; a four-hour variety show. The small space had a capacity of 200 people and a very large stage, which was longer than the main room of the club, and allowed for large performances. Large murals decorated the exterior and interior, and rotating exhibitions were held showcasing local and regional artists. The space relied solely on cover charges and bar sales, paying its performers a percentage of the admission revenues. 8BC was awarded a Bessie Award for its contributions to the local art community in 1985. The space closed on October 22, 1985 by agreement with the New York City Department of Buildings due to never obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy to operate and violating zoning regulations for the neighborhood. A few days after the closing, a front-page New York Times article about the demise of 8BC and several other East Village clubs and performance spaces speculated that an era of small downtown New York clubs was being eclipsed by larger enterprises such as Palladium, The Limelight and Area. In 2000, Conboy donated his materials related to 8BC to the Archives of American Art. Performers During its first year the space showcased over 650 performances ranging from punk rock bands to cultural performances such as Japanese Butoh. Notable performers include: Karen Finley, Steve Buscemi, John Zorn, They Might Be Giants, Leisure Class, Ethyl Eichelberger, Holly Hughes, Charles Busch, Rhys Chatham, XS: The Opera Opus, k.d. lang, and the Wayfarers.

Early life Born 28 March 1941, Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire, Simmons grew up there. He attended Accrington Technical School and then Blackburn Technical College, where he proved to be a gifted cricketer. However he did not show enough consistency at an early stage to attract the attention of County selectors. Instead following leaving school he became a journeyman professional cricketer in the lower Lancashire leagues. However his reputation and ability soon developed, and by his late 20s, Lancashire County Cricket Club had begun to scout him. First-class career Simmons was a lower-order right-hand batsman and a right-arm off break bowler who achieved almost iconic status for both the major teams that he played for. Solidly- built, he looked very little like an athlete, yet his close fielding was sharp and he remained fit into his late 40s. A late arrival in county cricket at the age of 28,Lyles, C. \\"Love affair with a single red rose\\", The Daily Telegraph, 22 March 2008, p. 16. Simmons then enjoyed a 20-year career in which he was an integral part of the Lancashire side, though rarely hitting the headlines. His flat bowling trajectory and his accuracy meant that he could be economical in one-day cricket, and he was part of the highly successful Lancashire side under Jack Bond that won the Gillette Cup, the premier one-day competition in England, for three years in a row from 1970 to 1972. Simmons and slow left-arm bowler David Hughes were the first pair of spin bowlers to be used regularly and successfully in one-day cricket, which had previously been the preserve of seam bowling. In first-class cricket, Simmons reliably contributed more than 500 runs and 50 wickets in most seasons in his career,Statistical summary and at the age of 47, he took 63 wickets in the 1988 season. The affection for \\"Flat Jack\\" in Lancashire was shown by his 1980 benefit, which raised ¬£128,000. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1985. In 1972‚Äì73, he was invited to Tasmania to captain the local state side, whose first-class matches were restricted to games against touring sides. In six seasons as captain, Simmons led Tasmania into full first-class status and into the Sheffield Shield competition from 1977‚Äì78.

The igneous intrusion leads to a volcanic eruption. In geology, country rock is the rock native to an area, in contrast to any intrusion of viscous geologic material, commonly magma, or perhaps rock salt (in salt domes) or unconsolidated sediments. dike intrudes into the country rock, Baranof Island, Alaska, United States Magma is typically less dense than the rock it intrudes, widening and filling existing cracks, sometimes melting the already- existing country rock. The term \\"country rock\\" is similar to, and in many cases interchangeable with, the terms basement and wall rocks. Country rock can denote the widespread lithology of a region in relation to the rock which is being discussed or observed. Geologic settings Settings in geology when the term country rock is used include: Igneous intrusions When describing a pluton or dike, the igneous rock can be described as intruding the surrounding country rock, the rock into which the pluton has intruded.Newfoundland and Labrador, Glossary of Geological Terms Accessed June 2018. When country rock is intruded by dyke, perpendicular to the bedding plane, it is called discordant intrusion, while a parallel intrusion by a sill indicates a sub-parallel or concordant intrusion. Most intrusions into country rock are via magma. Usually, country rock is intruded by an igneous body of rock which formed when magma forced upward through fractures, or melted through overlying rock. Magma then cooled into solid rock, different from the surrounding country rock. Sometimes, a fragment of country rock will break off and become incorporated into the intrusion, and is called a xenolith, from Greek, , xenos, \\"strange,\\", and , lithos, the ancient Greek word for \\"stone.\\" The heat of the intrusions usually changes the country rock, often to contact metamorphic rock. Commonly, hornfels is produced, or skarn. Alluvial settings When describing recent alluvium, the material that has arrived through volcanic, glacial or fluvial action can be described as a veneer on the (older) country rock.

It is also grown in Armenia, Moldova, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and in small quantities in the Niagara and Finger Lakes regions of New York State and Northeast Ohio. Its leaves are 3-lobed, large, and roundish. The berries are medium to large, elliptic or round depending on the type, dark bluish, and thin-skinned; with a maturation period of approximately 5 months and moderate productivity. It is an extractive wine with a characteristic bouquet, a harmonious taste, and pleasant astringency. Its alcoholic strength ranges from 10.5-12.5% and titrated acidity 5-7%. It is known to have been in production since 1886. Saperavi grapes produce very deep red wines that are suitable for extended aging. It has the potential to produce high alcohol levels, and is often blended with lighter varieties. It is by far the most dominant Georgian red grape in terms of overall production. Saperavi is a hardy variety, known for its ability to handle extremely cold weather and is popular for growing in high altitude and inland regions such as Kakheti. It is a teinturier grape, containing the red anthrocyanin within the grape pulp as well as the skin and is unusual in being one of very few such grapes used in single-varietal winemaking. History The Saperavi grape originated in the Kakheti region of Eastern Georgia and now is spread throughout its entire territory (Kakheti, Saingilo, Kartli, Shavshet-Klarjeti, Imereti, Guria, Racha and Lechkhumi). The Saperavi variety is one of the oldest cultivars from the region, and has consistently been the most important in Georgia's commercial winemaking industry. Wines Moldova Saperavi grapes are used predominantly in Georgia, but have spread to other regions of Eastern Europe more recently (Purcari, Moldova). Saperavi cultivars are also being grown in New World wine regions, notably in Finger Lakes, New York area vineyards. It has shown promising results for a few growers in Australia, where it was pioneered in the King Valley Region of North East Victoria. Notable Georgian wines made exclusively or predominately with Saperavi grapes: '; a natural semi-sweet wine, aged for 2 years, produced in the Kvareli region. Grapes are harvested later than for most other wines made from Saperavi. * Akhasheni; a semi-sweet wine similar to Kindzmarauli, produced in the Gurdzhaani region. * Mukuzani; a dry wine, aged for 3 years, produced in the Mukuzani region. It is sourced from the best of the local vintages; and is considered as one of the best of the Georgian wines. * Napareuli; a dry wine, aged for 3 years, produced in the Napareuli microzone, Telavi region. It is sourced from the best of the local vintages; and is considered as one of the best of the Georgian wines. * Alazani; a light semi-sweet wine, produced in the Alazani region. A blend of 60% Saperavi and 40% Rkatsiteli. The warmer climate produces sweeter grapes than other regions.

The history of Vancouver is one that extends back thousands of years, with its first inhabitants arriving in the area following the Last Glacial Period. Vancouver is situated in British Columbia, Canada; with its location near the mouth of the Fraser River and on the waterways of the Strait of Georgia, Howe Sound, Burrard Inlet, and their tributaries. Vancouver has, for thousands of years, been a place of meeting, trade, and settlement. The presence of people in what is now called the Lower Mainland of British Columbia dates from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago when the glaciers of the last ice age began to disappear. The area, known to the First Nations as S'√≥lh T√©m√©xw, shows archeological evidence of a seasonal encampment (\\"the Glenrose Cannery site\\") near the mouth of the Fraser River that dates from that time. The first Europeans to explore the area were Spanish Captain Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez in 1791, and British naval Captain George Vancouver in 1792. The area was not settled by Europeans until almost a century later, in 1862. The city grew rapidly following completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) transcontinental line from Eastern Canada, allowing for continuous rail service in the late 1880s. Chinese settlers were increasingly a presence in the area following completion of the CPR. Subsequent waves of immigration were initially of Europeans moving west, and later, with the advent of global air travel, from Asia and many other parts of the world. Early history  First Nations settlements The Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast are the original inhabitants of what is now known as Vancouver. The city falls within the traditional territory of three Coast Salish peoples known as, Squamish (S·∏µwxw√∫7mesh), Tsleil-waututh and Xwm√©thkwyiem (\\"Musqueam\\"‚Äîfrom masqui \\"an edible grass that grows in the sea\\"). On the southern shores of Vancouver along the Fraser River, Xwm√©thkwyiem live with their main community. In the False Creek and Burrard Inlet area, Squamish currently live on numerous villages in North Vancouver, with their territory also a part of Howe Sound and upwards towards the town of Whistler. Further down the Burrard Inlet, Tsleil-Waututh have their main community. Xwm√©thkwyiem and Tsleil-Waututh historically spoke a language dialect of Halkomelem language, whereas Squamish language is separate but related. Their language is more closely connected to their Shishalh neighbors at Sechelt. Historically the area of where Vancouver is now was all resource gathering places for food or materials. An indigenous village at Coal Harbour in 1886. Vancouver fell within the traditional territory of three Coast Salish peoples. The Musqueam have been living continuously at their main winter village, Xwm√©thkwyiem, at the mouth of the Fraser River, for 4,000 years. Vancouver's ecosystem, with its abundant plant and animal life, provides a wealth of food and materials that have supported the people for over 10,000 years. At the time of first European contact, the recently arrived Squamish people had villages in the areas around present-day Vancouver in places like Stanley Park, Kitsilano and False Creek area, as well as Burrard Inlet. Tsleil-Waututh were said to also be settled on Burrard Inlet at the time of George Vancouver's arrival in 1792. The largest villages were at Xwemelch'stn (sometimes rendered Homulchesan), near the mouth of the Capilano River and roughly beneath where the north foot of the present Lions Gate Bridge is today, and at Musqueam. XÃ±w√°√ΩxÃ±way was a large village in Stanley Park (in the Lumberman's Arch area). The foundation of a Catholic mission at the village, called Eslha7an, near Mosquito Creek engendered the creation of another large community of Squamish there. Along False Creek, at the south foot of Burrard Bridge, another village called Senakw, existed at one time a large community, and during colonization was the residence of Squamish historian August Jack Khatsahlano. The Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast had achieved a very high level of cultural complexity for a food gathering base. As Bruce Macdonald notes in Vancouver: a visual history: \\"Their economic system encouraged hard work, the accumulation of wealth and status and the redistribution of wealth...\\" Winter villages, in what is now known as Vancouver, were composed of large plankhouses made of Western Red Cedar wood. Gatherings called potlatches were common in the summer and winter months when the spirit powers were active. These ceremonies continue to be an important part of the social and spiritual life of the people.  European exploration  was the lead ship used by George Vancouver. In 1792, his expedition charted several points and inlets, including Point Grey and Burrard Inlet. Spanish Captain Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez was the first European to explore the Strait of Georgia in 1791. He landed at Point Grey and entered Burrard Inlet. In the following year, 1792, the British naval Captain George Vancouver (1757‚Äì1798) met the Spanish expedition of Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano and Cayetano Vald√©s y Flores off Point Grey, and together further explored the Strait of Georgia. Vancouver also explored Puget Sound in the present day Seattle area. Vancouver, surveying in small boats with his officer Peter Puget, arrived at the present city of Vancouver before the Spanish. They first landed at what Vancouver later named Point Grey. Puget informally called the place Noon Breakfast Point. Puget's name was officially given to the southwest tip of Point Grey in 1981. Simon Fraser was the first European to reach the area overland, descending the river which bears his name in 1808. Despite the influx of the Fraser Gold Rush in 1858‚Äì59, settlement on Burrard Inlet and English Bay was almost unknown prior to the early 1860s due in large part to the lack of interest in the area as the access to the BC interior was via the City of New Westminster and the Fraser River and also due to the power of the Squamish chiefs over the area. Robert Burnaby and Moberly camped and prospected for coal in what is now Coal Harbour in the summer of 1859. They had an amicable relationship with the First Nations of the area. Robert Burnaby wrote to his family, \\"our [spare] time has been occupied in exploring all the ins and outs of this Inlet, which I prophesy will become one of the greatest naval rendezvous and centres of commerce on this side of the world.\\" European settlement and growth The first non-native settlement in the city limits of Vancouver was about 1862 at McCleery's Farm, in the vicinity of what is now the Southlands area. View of Gastown from Carrall and Water Street in 1886. Named after John Deighton, Gastown was Vancouver's first downtown core. Lumbering was the early industry along Burrard Inlet, now the site of Vancouver's seaport. The first sawmill began operating in 1863 at Moodyville, a planned settlement built by American lumber entrepreneur Sewell \\"Sue\\" Moody. In 1915, it expanded as a municipality and was renamed \\"North Vancouver\\"; the name Moodyville still applies to the Lower Lonsdale district, though more as a marketing term than in common usage (Moodyville proper was a few blocks to the east). The first export of lumber took place in 1865; this lumber was shipped to Australia. In 1867, the first sawmill on the south shore of Burrard Inlet, Stamp's Mill, began producing lumber at what is now the foot of Dunlevy Avenue in Vancouver.McDonald, R. A. (1996). Making Vancouver: Class, status and social boundaries, 1863‚Äì1913. Vancouver, BC, Canada: UBC Press, p 7. A site for the mill was originally planned at Brockton Point in what is now Stanley Park, but the Brockton Point site proved infeasible due to nearby currents and shoals which made docking difficult. The largest trees in the world grew along the south shores of False Creek and English Bay and provided (amongst other things) masts for the world's windjammer fleets and the increasingly large vessels of the Royal Navy. One famous sale of trees cut from the Jericho neighbourhood (west of Kitsilano), was a special order for the Celestial Emperor of China consisting of dozens of immense beams for the construction of The Gate of Heavenly Peace in the Forbidden City, Beijing. Millworkers and lumberers were from a wide variety of backgrounds ‚Äì mostly Scandinavians and Nootkas ‚Äì who were also brought to the inlet to help with the local whaling industry. At first, Squamish typically did not work in the mills. First Vancouver City Council meeting after the Great Vancouver Fire in 1886. A former river pilot, John (Jack) Deighton, set up a small (24' x 12') saloon on the beach about a mile west of the sawmill in 1867 where mill property and its \\"dry\\" policies ended. His place was popular and a well-worn trail between the mill and saloon was soon established ‚Äì this is today's Alexander Street. Deighton's nickname, Gassy Jack, came about because he was known as quite the talker, or \\"gassy\\". A number of men began living near the saloon and the \\"settlement\\" quickly became known as Gassy's Town, which was quickly shortened to \\"Gastown\\". In 1870, the colonial government of British Columbia took notice of the growing settlement and sent a surveyor to lay out an official townsite named Granville, in honour of the British Colonial Secretary, Lord Granville, though it was still popularly known as Gastown (which is the name still current for that part of the city). The new townsite was situated on a natural harbour, and for this reason it was selected by the Canadian Pacific Railway as their terminus. The transcontinental railway was commissioned by the government of Canada under the leadership of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald and was a condition of British Columbia joining confederation in 1871. The CPR president, William Van Horne, decided that Granville was not such a great name for the new terminus because of the seedy associations with Gastown, and strongly suggested \\"Vancouver\\" would be a better name, in part because people in Toronto and Montreal knew where Vancouver Island was but had no idea of where Granville was. The first Canadian Pacific Railway train arrived in Vancouver in May 1887. Under its new name the city was incorporated on April 6, 1886. Two months later, on June 13, a spectacular blaze destroyed most of the city along the swampy shores of Burrard Inlet in twenty-five minutes. The Great Vancouver Fire, which destroyed the city, was eventually considered to be beneficial, as the city was rebuilt with modern water, electricity and streetcar systems. Things recovered quickly after the fire, although celebratory Dominion Day festivities to launch the opening of the CPR were postponed a year as a result. The first regular transcontinental train from Montreal, Quebec arrived at a temporary terminus at Port Moody, British Columbia, in July 1886, and service to Vancouver itself began in May 1887. That year Vancouver's population was 1,000, by 1891 it reached 14,000 and by 1901 it was 26,000. The population increased to 120,000 by 1911. The Port of Vancouver became internationally significant as a result of its key position in the All-Red Route, which spanned the global trade network of the British Empire, with the combined steamship and railway of the CPR shortening shipping times from the Orient to London drastically, with the new city becoming a node for major speculative investment by British and German capital.Morley, A. (1974). Vancouver: From Milltown to Metropolis. Vancouver: Mitchell Press.Strangers Entertained, British Columbia government centennial publication, 1971 The completion of the Panama Canal initially reduced Vancouver's shipping traffic by becoming the new preferred route from Asia to Europe, however reduced freight rates in the 1920s made it viable to ship even Europe-bound prairie grain west through Vancouver in addition to grains that already shipped to parts of Asia. 1900 to 1940 Economy Connaught Bridge shortly after its completion in 1911. The rise of automobiles led to the construction of new bridges that could accommodate vehicles over False Creek. With the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, Vancouver's seaport was able to compete with the major international ports for global trade because it was positioned as an alternative route to Europe. During the 1920s, the provincial government successfully fought to have freight rates that discriminated against goods transported by rail through the mountains eliminated, giving the young lawyer of the case, Gerry McGeer, a reputation as \\"the man who flattened the Rockies.\\"Eric Nicol, Vancouver. Toronto: Doubleday, 1970. Consequently, prairie wheat came west through Vancouver rather than being shipped out through eastern ports. The federal government established the Vancouver Harbour Commission development. With its completion in 1923, Ballantyne Pier was the most technologically advanced port in the British Empire. \\"Port of Vancouver ‚Äì Yesterday,\\" [video] Port of Vancouver [website]. The CPR, lumber exporters, terminal operators, and other companies based on the waterfront banded together after World War I to establish the Shipping Federation of British Columbia as an employers‚Äô association to manage industrial relations on the increasingly busy waterfront.Andrew Yarmie, \\"The Right to Manage: Vancouver Employers‚Äô Associations, 1900‚Äì1923,\\" BC Studies, no. 90 (1991): 40‚Äì74. The Federation fought vociferously against unionization, defeating a series of strikes and breaking unions until the determined longshoremen established the current ILWU local after the Second World War.Paul A. Phillips, No Power Greater: A Century of Labour in British Columbia. Vancouver: BC Federation of Labour/Boag Foundation, 1967. By the 1930s, commercial traffic through the port had become the largest sector in Vancouver's economy.Leah Stevens, \\"Rise of the Port of Vancouver,\\" Economic Geography 12, no. 1 (January 1936): 61‚Äì70, and R. C. McCandless, \\"Vancouver‚Äôs ‚ÄòRed Menace‚Äô of 1935: The Waterfront Situation,\\" BC Studies 22 (1974): 56‚Äì70. The rapid growth in automobiles and trucks after 1910 led to the construction of new bridges over False Creek including: the Granville Street Bridge, (1889 rebuilt 1954), the Burrard Street Bridge, 1932, and the Cambie Street Bridge, (1912 rebuilt 1984). Auto traffic to North Vancouver was facilitated with the construction of the first Second Narrow's Bridge in 1925 and by the completion of the Lion's Gate Bridge, in 1938, across the First Narrows. Social controversies Although the provincial resource-based economy allowed Vancouver to flourish, it was nonetheless not immune to the vagaries of organized labour. Two general strikes were launched by labour groups during the years following the First World War, including Canada's first general strike following the death of a trade unionist, Ginger Goodwin. Major recessions and depressions hit the city hard in the late 1890s, 1919, 1923, and 1929, which, aside from creating hardship also may have fuelled social tensions. In particular, members of the new and growing Asian population were subjected to discrimination as well as periodic upsurges of more physical objections to their arrival. anti-Oriental riots in Vancouver. The most overt expression of this may have been the 1907 riots thought to have been organized by the Asiatic Exclusion League, a group formed under organized labour and inspired by its counterpart in San Francisco.W. Peter Ward, White Canada Forever: Popular Attitudes and Public Policy Towards Orientals in British Columbia, 3rd ed. Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queens University Press, 2002. But discrimination was perhaps less overt than such events suggest. It could be argued that some politicians and publicists may have promoted and disseminated controversial ideologies through popular books such as H. Glynn-Ward's 1921 The Writing on the Wall and Tom MacInnes‚Äôs 1929 The Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. Newspapermen such as L. D. Taylor of the Vancouver World and General Victor Odlum of the Star generated a glut of editorials analyzing and warning about the \\"Oriental Menace,\\" as did Danger: The Anti-Asiatic Weekly.Patricia Roy, \\"The Oriental ‚ÄòMenace‚Äô in British Columbia,\\" J. Friesen and H. K.

What may be called a \\"climate of fear and hysteria\\" in the 1920s, culminated in the 'Janet Smith case', in which a Chinese national was accused of killing his young, white, female co-worker. The evidence for his guilt was perhaps based more on stereotyping than facts.Ian Macdonald and Betty O‚ÄôKeefe, Canadian Holy War: A Story of Clans, Tongs, Murder, and Bigotry. Vancouver: Heritage House, 2000. A growing population of Indians, primarily from the province of Punjab and of the Sikh religion, were also required to abide by immigration laws starting in 1908, despite the fact that they were subjects of the British Empire. This culminated in the 1914 Komagata Maru incident, in which most of 376 immigrants on the Komagata Maru, most of them from the Punjab in India were not permitted to disembark because they had not complied with immigration laws that required that they come by a continuous passage from their home country. incident involved a migrants from the British Raj attempting to move to Canada, but were denied entry upon their arrival to Vancouver. A group of residents of Indian origin rallied in support of the passengers. After losing a court challenge of the immigration laws, the ship remained in Burrard Inlet while negotiations continued concerning its departure. When negotiations dragged on, the head immigration officer in Vancouver arranged an attempt by the Vancouver police and other officials to board the ship, who were repelled by what the Vancouver Sun reported as \\"howling masses of Hindus\\". Subsequently, the federal government sent a naval ship and after concessions made by the federal Minister of Agriculture, an MP from Penticton, the ship departed. After returning to India, twenty of the passengers were shot by police in an incident after they refused to return to the Punjab.Johnston, Hugh J.M., The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar. Delhi: Oxford University Press. 1979. The quote was taken from Komagata Maru. US Relations In 1923 Warren Harding became the first US President to set foot in Canada. He met with the Premier of BC and the Mayor of Vancouver and spoke to a crowd of 50,000 in Stanley Park. A monument to Harding designed by Charles Marega was unveiled in Stanley Park in 1925.Warren G. Harding & Stanley Park. The History of Metropolitan Vancouver. Vancouver.ca . Retrieved June 11, 2017 Vice and politics Malahat was a rum-rummer that used Vancouver as its home port during the Prohibition Era of the neighbouring United States. Vancouver, home port of the 246 ft. Malahat, a five-masted schooner known as the \\"Queen of Rum Row,\\" maintained an active liquor trade throughout the Prohibition Era of the neighboring United States, despite efforts to bring Prohibition to Canada. Vancouver's longest serving and most often elected mayor, L. D. Taylor, followed an \\"open town\\" policy prior to his final defeat in 1934 to Gerry McGeer. Essentially, the policy was that vice crimes such as prostitution, gambling, and bootlegging would be managed, rather than eliminated, so that police resources could be directed towards major crime. Greg Marquis, ‚ÄúVancouver Vice: The Police and the Negotiation of Morality, 1904‚Äì1935,‚Äù Essays in the History of Canadian Law: Volume VI British Columbia and the Yukon. Hamar Foster and John McLaren, eds. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1995: 242‚Äì273. A consequence of this, in addition to assumptions that Taylor was colluding with the criminal underworld, was the maintenance of red light districts in racialized neighbourhoods, such as Chinatown, Japantown, and Hogan's Alley, which perpetuated the association of non-whites with immorality and vice crime.Excerpt from Daniel Francis's L. D. in the Vancouver Courier Taylor suffered the biggest electoral defeat the city had seen in 1934, largely on this issue.Daniel Francis, L. D.: Mayor Louis Taylor and the Rise of Vancouver, Vancouver: Arsenal Pulp Press, 2004. McGeer ran on a law and order platform, resulting in a crackdown on vice crimes, which, after years of Taylor's \\"open town,\\" sought to clean up crime. Unfortunately, policing non- white communities was key to successfully executing the plan.Kay J. Anderson, Vancouver‚Äôs Chinatown: Racial Discourse in Canada, 1875‚Äì1980. Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queens University Press, 1991. Even the East End (today's Strathcona) had by WWI been largely vacated by English, Scottish, and Irish residents who moved to the wealthier (and whiter) new developments of the West End and Shaughnessy. The East End, the original residential district that grew up around Hasting's Mill, was left to successive waves of new immigrants, and became associated with poverty and vice, (as the Downtown Eastside remains today).Daphne Marlatt and Carole Itter eds., Opening Doors: Vancouver‚Äôs East End. Sound Heritage Series, vol. VIII, nos. 1‚Äì2. Victoria, BC: Aural History Project, 1979. Property/neighbourhood development The first act of City Council at its first meeting in 1886 was to request that the military reserve be handed over for use as a park. Historians have pointed out that this may seem a strange priority for the nascent city as there was an abundance of green space at the time. The West End, however, was designated to be an upscale neighbourhood by speculators with connections to the CPR.,Eric Nicol, Vancouver. Toronto: Doubleday, 1970. On page 50 Nicol writes that \\"in addition to the substantial grant of land from Smithe's [provincial] government, the company secured appreciable holding from a private syndicate, including original residents Morton, Brighouse and Hailstone. Some of these owners of small losts made what they thought was a killing, till the rapid increase of land values proved the corpus delicti to be their own.\\" On the setting aside of Stanley Park as part of real estate development in the West End, including the role of CPR Land Commissioner, L. A. Hamilton, see Robert A. J. McDonald, \\"'Holy Retreat' or 'Practical Breathing Spot'?

They did not want the scattered settlements on this property to grow into another industrial, working-class neighbourhood.Mike Steele, The Stanley Park Explorer, Vancouver: Whitecap Books, 1985, and Eric Nicol, Vancouver. Toronto: Doubleday, 1970. This act also signaled the beginning of the process that would see the remaining inhabitants of various origins evicted as squatters in the 1920s for the creation of a seemingly pristine park.Jean Barman, Stanley Park‚Äôs Secret: The Forgotten Families of Whoi Whoi, Kanaka Ranch, and Brockton Point, Vancouver: Harbour Publishing, 2005. It has been suggested that perhaps the new Stanley Park would over time be purged of any trace of native occupation. However over time the Parks Board has begun to refill it with Native artifacts.Mike Steele, The Stanley Park Explorer, Vancouver: Whitecap Books, 1985. Photo of Tim Cummings' home, the last person to reside in Stanley Park. He resided there until his death (1958), even after the city evicted most of the other Park inhabitants in 1931. In 1877, only six years after British Columbia joined Canada, Superintendent of Education John Jessop submitted a proposal for the formation of a provincial university. An Act Respecting the University of British Columbia was passed by the provincial legislature in 1890, but disagreements arose over whether to build the university on Vancouver Island or the mainland. A provincial university was formally called into being by the British Columbia University Act of 1908, although its location was not yet specified. Originally titled McGill University College of British Columbia (associated with McGill University in Montreal), it was selected in 1910 to be constructed at a site at Point Grey, though the outbreak of the First World War delayed construction. The now- independent University of British Columbia began operations in 1915. In 1911, Vancouver expanded with the amalgamation of Hastings Townsite (originally called New Brighton). The former municipality's name continues on in the Hastings-Sunrise neighbourhood, which covers the same territory. By the interwar years, other neighbourhoods had grown that were working class, but not especially impoverished or racially exclusive, such as Mount Pleasant, the suburb of South Vancouver, and Grandview-Woodland.Jean Barman, \\"Neighbourhood and Community in Interwar Vancouver,\\" Robert A. J. McDonald and Jean Barman, eds., Vancouver‚Äôs Past: Essays in Social History. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1986: 97‚Äì141. Even the West End was becoming less exclusive. CPR developers once again established a new enclave for the city's white and wealthy elite that would pull them from the West End and be the destination for the \\"coming smart set.\\" Point Grey was incorporated in 1908 for this purpose, and Shaughnessy Heights would be developed exclusively for the \\"richest and most prominent citizens,\\" who were required to spend a minimum of $6, 000 on the construction of new homes, which were to conform to specific style requirements.Jean Barman, \\"Neighbourhood and Community in Interwar Vancouver,\\" Robert A. J. McDonald and Jean Barman, eds., Vancouver‚Äôs Past: Essays in Social History. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1986: 97‚Äì141. These patterns of economic segregation were apparently secured by 1929 when Point Grey and South Vancouver were amalgamated with Vancouver. Point Grey included the current neighbourhoods of Arbutus Ridge, Dunbar-Southlands, Kerrisdale and Marpole, Oakridge, Shaughnessy and South Cambie, and South Vancouver included the current neighbourhoods of Cedar Cottage, Collingwood, Killarney, Riley Park-Little Mountain, Sunset, and Victoria-Fraserview. William Harold Malkin was the first mayor of the new city, having defeated incumbent Louis Denison Taylor, the champion of amalgamation, in the 1928 civic election. The depression RCMP officers attack Relief Camp Workers' Union protesters in 1938. Several protests over unemployment occurred in the city during the Great Depression. BC was perhaps the hardest Canadian province hit by the depression. Although Vancouver managed to stave off bankruptcy, other cities in the Lower Mainland were not so lucky, such as North Vancouver and Burnaby. Vancouver also happened to be the target destination for thousands of transients ‚Äì unemployed young men ‚Äì who traveled across Canada looking for work, often by hopping on boxcars. This was the end of the line and had for years been a \\"Mecca of the Unemployed\\" because, as some cynically joked, it was the only city in Canada where you could starve to death before freezing to death.Patricia Roy, \\"Vancouver: Mecca of the Unemployed, 1907‚Äì1929,\\" Alan F.

Artibise, ed., Town and City: Aspects of Western Canadian Urban Development, Regina: Canadian Plains Research Center, 1981: 393‚Äì413, and Tom McEwan, The Forge Glows Red: From Blacksmith to Revolutionary. Toronto: Progress Books, 1974. \\"Hobo jungles\\" sprouted up in the earliest days of the depression, where men built makeshift shanty towns out of whatever they could find (or steal).Todd McCallum, \\"The Great Depression‚Äôs First History? The Vancouver Archives of Major J. S. Mathews and the Writing of Hobo History,\\" Canadian Historical Review 87, no. 1 (March 2006): 79‚Äì107. The largest of these was shut down allegedly for being unsanitary. Vancouver was also the launching pad for the Communist-led unemployed protests that frequented the city throughout the decade, culminating in the relief camp strike and the On-to-Ottawa Trek in 1935. Communist agitators and their supporters also led strikes in other industries, most notably the 1935 waterfront strike, and organized a large proportion of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion from Vancouver to fight fascism in the Spanish Civil War as Canada's (unofficial) contribution to the International Brigades. Civic celebrations Vancouver was the site of major celebrations in 1936, in part to bolster civic spirit in the midst of the depression, as well as to celebrate Vancouver's Jubilee. Mayor McGeer provoked considerable controversy by organizing expensive celebrations at a time when the city was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and civic employees were working at a significantly reduced pay rate. Nevertheless, he did find a great deal of support from those that agreed a celebration would ultimately be good for the city's prosperity. While some large expenditures were roundly criticized ‚Äì for example, the \\"ugly\\" fountain erected in Stanley Park's Lost Lagoon ‚Äì others drew significant financial and public support, such as the construction of a new (and the current) city hall on Cambie Street. The next major civic celebration was the 1939 Royal visit of the King and Queen as part of their tour of Canada which marked the end of the depression and the likelihood of another world war.David Ricardo Williams, Mayor Gerry: The Remarkable Gerald Gratten McGeer. Douglas and MacIntyre, 1986. World War II :See the related article Japanese Canadian internment Shipyard workers working on a Victory ship. During World War II, many factories in Vancouver began to produce products for the war effort. The outbreak of the Second World War resulted in major changes for Vancouver. Local militia units quickly recruited extra members and Vancouver's Seaforth Highlanders of Canada, for example, had a battalion overseas in England within 4 months, and they remained in Europe fighting until the end of the war. The British Columbia Regiment, 15th Field Regiment RCA, 6th Field Engineers, HMCS Discovery and others all contributed to the war effort. Massive new spending by the governments and employment in the military and factories provided a much needed economic boost after the Great Depression of the 1930s. Among the many products and weapons for war service produced in the Vancouver area were minesweepers and corvettes for the Royal Canadian Navy; anti-aircraft guns in Burnaby and the Boeing aircraft factory in nearby Richmond produced parts for B-29 bomber aircraft. The old defences for Vancouver Harbour were upgraded with coast artillery positions at Point Grey (the Museum of Anthropology is built on top of this); Stanley Park; under the Lion's Gate Bridge and at Point Atkinson. In 1942, a few months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Canadians were \\"evacuated\\" from the West Coast. The Americans did the same with their citizens of Japanese ancestry. Canadians of Japanese descent were placed into holding areas such as the barns at Hastings Park and then interned in camps in the interior by the federal government which evoked the War Measures Act. Due to the fear of bombing and of poison gas attacks, a blackout was imposed on the West Coast in 1942 and school children and others were issued gas masks. Japan did indeed attack the West Coast. A Japanese submarine shelled Estevan Point Lighthouse, Japanese soldiers invaded and held island in Alaska and Japanese balloon bombs (Fire balloon) were floated across the Pacific Ocean on air currents to wreak their havoc on the forests and citizens of Canada and the USA. Locally these ballon bombs landed as close to Vancouver as Point Roberts, but their existence was kept a secret until very late in the war. 1950 ‚Äì present CBUT, the oldest television station in Western Canada, first went on the air in December 1953. The Oak Street Bridge, connecting Vancouver to Richmond across the Fraser River, opened in 1957. While the Second Narrows Bridge and the Lions' Gate Bridge had provided a connection to the North Shore since 1925 and 1938 respectively, the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing followed in 1960. The last vestiges of British Columbia Electric Railway's streetcar and interurban rail system were dismantled in 1958. Another major bridge across the Fraser River, the Port Mann Bridge to Surrey, opened in 1964. Two new universities were established, the British Columbia Institute of Technology in 1964 and Simon Fraser University in 1965; both have satellite campuses in Vancouver. Residents of Strathcona ‚Äì most of them Chinese ‚Äì formed a protest movement led by civic activist Mary Lee Chan and prevented the construction of a freeway which would have resulted in the bulldozing of the neighbourhood. In 1967, the Greater Vancouver Regional District was incorporated. Greenpeace, one of the leading international environmental organizations, was founded in Vancouver in 1971. In 1968 the Canada Council awarded a $3,500 grant to Joachim Foikis of Vancouver \\"to revive the ancient and time-honoured tradition of town fool.\\" He made a habit of attending all city council meetings in full traditional jester's outfit, adding wit, nursery rhymes and interest to the normally pedestrian meetings and bringing international attention to Vancouver.New York Times, May 14, 1968Northumberland needs county jester to lighten up politics :: Consider This :: community voices in discourse Disc sports debuted in Vancouver on Kitsilano Beach in 1974 with the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships. The continuing growth of the airport on Sea Island resulted in the construction of another bridge across the Fraser River, the Arthur Laing Bridge which opened to traffic in 1975. Expo 86 was held in Vancouver. The theme of the world fair was transportation and communication. As Pacific Central Station replaced Waterfront Station as the main railway station in 1979, the latter was transformed into the terminal of SeaBus and the future SkyTrain (which opened six years later). Canada's first domed stadium, BC Place Stadium opened in 1983. The SkyTrain and the BC Place Stadium, as well as Science World, Canada Place and the Plaza of Nations, were constructed for Expo 86. This significant international event was the last World's Fair held in North America and was considered a success, receiving 22,111,578 visits. In 1951 the population stood at 562,000; by 1971 it reached 1,000,000. The Park Royal Shopping Centre, in West Vancouver, became the first in the city in 1950 and Empire Stadium, was built to host the 1954 British Empire Games. Vancouver became the western anchor of the new CBC national television network in 1958 and the western hub of the newly completed Trans-Canada Highway in 1962. The giant Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal, was built in 1959 for passenger and vehicle ferry service to southern Vancouver Island and the nearby Roberts Bank Superport coal terminal was finished in the late sixties. A second, Second Narrow's Bridge was built in 1960 and the W.A.C. Bennett Dam, was completed in 1967. The establishment of the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in 1959 and of Simon Fraser University in 1965, enriched city cultural life. Canada's first purpose-built auto racing track, the Westwood Motorsport Park was built in nearby Coquitlam, that same year. The first McDonald's restaurant outside the United States was opened in Richmond in 1967.

The name is Anglo-Saxon in origin and a derivation of \\"Shepherd's Cote\\". This suggests that the village, which was a hamlet prior to expansion since the 1980s, originated as the homestead of a shepherd, possibly in the early medieval period. Governance Hepscott lies within the Ulgham Division of the new county-wide unitary authority, Northumberland County Council. The County Councillor is Cllr David J. Towns (Conservative), and the village falls within the Northern Area Committee's jurisdiction. Landmarks The most historic building in Hepscott is Hepscott Hall, a three-storey, rectangular medieval pele tower. The Hall was associated with a deer park. The traces of part of the boundary wall of the deer park survive along the track to Field House Farm. Another historic building of importance is a smithy dating to the late 18th century that is a Grade II Listed Building. The heart of the community is the village hall, there are regular events and cultural activities including art shows, flower arranging lessons, wine tasting evenings and poetry recitals. Notable people Hepscott has recently lost its longest-living resident. Mrs Irene Violet Bevan was born at Barmoor, in the parish of Hepscott, on 27 January 1920. She died on 16 August 2010 aged 90. She knew Hepscott from a time when farming was by hand and horse, when Barmoor was bombed by the Luftwaffe and before it doubled in size from the 1970s onwards. She was instrumental in the Hepscott WI, Over 60s Club and Tea Party. She also helped save the land that the school and church stood on from development from personal knowledge that the land was left to the village by Lord Carlisle. It is partly due to her that there is a village hall on this land. Irene was a cousin, once-removed of the suffragette Emily Wilding Davison. Her mother and Emily were close friends as well as cousins. Irene held the family knowledge inherited from her mother that Emily did not intend to kill herself when she accosted the King's horse at the Epsom Derby in 1913. Her intention was to pin the suffragette colours on the horse. Other notable residents have included footballers John Barnes, David McCreary, Anton Ferdinand, Steven Taylor and football managers Jack Charlton, Gordon Lee and Ellie Taggart.

Description Girella cyanea can be recognized by its blue coloration and yellow spots, with its blueish color becoming a greyish-green in post mortem. The adults of this species are they can attain a length of 76cm and their bright flank spots aare distinctive. When they are younger they are greeny-grey in colour and the spots are paler yellow. These fish have a small beak-like mouth and they have large scales. Sea chubs are easily recognized by distinct morphological characteristics such as their ovate-shaped bodies, small mouths, and weakly- forked strong caudal fin. A key characteristic also being a spinous dorsal fin with low spines followed by a higher evenly curved or falcate soft dorsal fin.  Distribution & habitat  Girella cyanea are commonly found in the south- west Pacific Ocean; occurring along the east coast of Australia from Flinders Reef off Cape Moreton in Queensland to Eden in southern New South Wales. The species can also be found at Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs, Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands, and New Zealand's North and Kermadec Islands. Bluefish are ocean dwellers and do not generally enter rivers or estuaries. Juveniles are known to live in tidal pools until they reach adulthood and form schools over reef areas. Adults can typically be found in coastal and offshore rocky reef areas in New South Wales at depths ranging from .  Ecology  Girella cyanea are omnivorous; they are known to eat crustaceans, smaller fishes, mollusks; along with calcareous seaweeds, brittle stars, cunjevoi, and marine worms. They are known to feed at dawn and dusk when they are most active. An ontogenetic diet was found in fish less than standard length. Those found in intertidal habitat having a mainly carnivorous diet and a digestive system without developed pyloric caeca. In contrast, pyloric caeca were well- developed in fish larger than and their diets possessed increased ingestion of algae.  Reproduction  Girella cyanea is a fast-growing and long-lived fish, with the oldest observed specimen being 41 years old. It is believed they transition into sexual maturity between 2 and 5 years of age or when they reach in length.  Conservation efforts  A fishing closure was placed across the state of New South Wales in 2006 due to the lack of sightings at the coast; despite the lack of official endangered species status. . However, recreational fishing is still permitted on Lord Howe Island. A bag limit of 5 fish per person per day is enforced in protection zones across the Marine Park. Taking or possessing bluefish from New South Wales waters, other than designated areas, is an offense that carries a multitude of penalties. Penalties for taking bluefish in contravention of the fishing closure can include fines of up to $110,000 for corporations while individuals can face fines of up to $22,000 along with up to 6 months in prison, or both. Penalties for possessing a Blue Drummer despite the fishing closure can include fines of up to $55,000 for corporations, while individuals can face fines of up to $11,000 and up to 3 months in prison, or both.

No.DR75401. It has just worked off the Keighley & Worth Valley Railway and is running to Ferryhill South Jnc on 3 February 2017. A tamping machine or ballast tamper is a machine used to pack (or tamp) the track ballast under railway tracks to make the tracks more durable. Prior to the introduction of mechanical tampers, this task was done by manual labour with the help of beaters. As well as being faster, more accurate, more efficient and less labour-intensive, tamping machines are essential for the use of concrete sleepers since they are too heavy (usually over ) to be lifted by hand. Whilst also available as a plain tamper with no lifting or lining function this article will focus on the multi function machines. Early machines only lifted the track and packed the ballast. More modern machines, sometimes known as a tamper-liner or tamping and lining machine, also correct the alignment of the rails to make them parallel and level, in order to achieve a more comfortable ride for passengers and freight and to reduce the mechanical strain applied to the rails by passing trains. This is done by finding places where the sleepers have sunk from the weight of the passing trains or frost action, causing the track to sag. The tamper lifts each sleeper and the rails up, and packs ballast underneath. When the sleeper is laid down again, the sagged rails now sit at the proper level. In cases where frost action has caused adjacent rails to rise higher, ballast tampers can raise rails above their original level to make the line level again. \\"Lining\\" rails doesn't involve ballast tamping, it merely ensures the rails are perfectly parallel and straight as possible. Combining tamping and lining into a single machine saves time and money, as only one machine needs to be run over the track to perform both functions.

Tamping process  The tamping process from any type of tamper consists of the following basic steps: # Lifting, lining unit moves rail and sleepers under tamping unit into correct vertical and horizontal position # Tamping units drive vibrating tines (35hz optimum) into the ballast on both sides of the sleeper until squeezing depth is achieved # Vibrating tines are pushed together to pack ballast under lifted, lined sleeper to ensure it holds position when released by the lifting, lining unit # Tamping unit retracts to rest position slightly above railhead, track is released by lifting, lining unit # Machine moves to the next sleeper and begins a new cycle  Standard tamping machine arrangement  The basic principles and functions of a tamping machine remain the same regardless of manufacturer with only minor differences in design.  Drive  The majority of track machines are powered by a diesel engine. This provides power to the driving wheels via either a hydrostatic circuit or cardan shaft, allowing the machine to propel itself to and around a work-site. The engine also drives a hydraulic pump to provide power for the various tools.  Lifting Lining Unit  The lifting lining unit of a tamping machine is used to lift and hold the track in corrected position while being tamped. All types of units require the following components to achieve this task: * Chassis, normally rectangular with 4 wheels to ride on the rails * Lifting cylinders, 1 cylinder on either side connecting the unit to main machine chassis and allowing unit to lift track vertically * Lining cylinders, 2 horizontal cylinders between unit chassis and main machine chassis used to push/pull the track horizontally * Clamp or \\"hook\\" assemblies, these are usually on the outside of each rail and utilize hydraulic cylinders to clamp onto the side of the rail head so that is locked to the unit chassis before lifting and lining is commenced The lifting lining unit is usually secured to the main machine chassis via an hydraulically length adjustable trailing arm, The arm is adjustable so that the unit can be moved clear of small obstructions such as insulated joints or wires.  Reference system  To ensure track geometry is corrected, most tamping machines use a two chord lining system (one for vertical alignment and one for horizontal alignment). The two chord system requires three reference trolleys fitted to the machine - usually called A point, B point and C point. Some machines will use a fourth point between B and C to carry out quality control measurements. A point is always the front reference point and sits on uncorrected track. The anchorage for chords on A point are able to move to compensate for defects in track geometry - this is done by the \\"tower\\" operator. Depending on the chord system, the anchorages will be either a wire anchor or a light source. B point is positioned as close as physically possible to the lifting lining unit. B point is used by the machine control system to position the track correctly using either potentiometers or optical filters, depending on type of chord system used. C point is the rear-most measuring point and anchorage point for lifting and lining chords. Depending on type of chord system C point will be either wire anchor with a tensioning cylinder or a photoelectric light receiver. All three points are individual rail trolleys able to freely move up, down, left and right independent of the machine chassis and hence follow any minor fluctuation in rail position. When working, the machine uses pneumatic cylinders to lightly push these trolleys into the selected datum rail both vertically and horizontally. When using this method, the tower operator positions A point anchorages according to existing track geometry measurements taken beforehand. Once A point has been positioned, it is then assumed that both A and C are in correct position as if machine were sitting on corrected track. The machine then uses the lifting lining unit to move the rail and B point in line with A and C.  Tamping units  System 7 fully hydraulic tamping head The Tamping units of most Tamping machines will consist of: * A set of tines either 8 or 16 per sleeper divided evenly between front and rear of sleeper * Mounting or \\"guide\\" rods that allow the unit as a whole to move up and down in a linear motion * Support frame * Squeezing arms * Tine mounts, can be either part of the squeezing arm or attached to it via a pin to allow swiveling depending on type of tamping machine To generate the vibration needed for penetration and consolidation there are two leading methods commonly used: * Using a hydraulically driven eccentric shaft attached either to the end of the squeezing cylinders or acting as the pivot point for the squeezing arms * Using a special squeezing cylinder and valve assembly to oscillate the tines A less common method more often seen on tamping head attachments for excavators is to use a motor driven vibrator assembly that is directly bolted to the support frame. Specialist tamping machines Continuous Action Tamping Machines A Continuous Action Tamping Machine (CAT) can pack between one and four sleepers at a time, with outputs between 320m/h and 2600m/h generally anticipated. Dynamic Tamping Express The 'Tamping Express' is a machine developed by Plasser & Theurer, and in the UK & Europe is referred to as the 09-3X. This machine consists of a conventional CAT stylish satellite with tooling for 3 sleepers in continuous succession, along with a full DTS stabilising unit suspended from the rear most vehicle in the machine. DGS / DTS (Dynamic Track Stabilising) Tamper in Jarvis PLC Fastline livery Tamping and cleaning operations have the adverse effect of reducing the resistance of the track to lateral movement. The resistance gradually recovers with the passage of trains, but may require a speed restriction imposed for the duration. This 'consolidation' can be achieved faster and in a more controlled manner using mechanised equipment known as the Dynamic Track Stabiliser (DTS). A DTS will normally be used only after a stretch of track has been tamped and aligned. D.G.S. has a vibrating unit which holds the track in position and applies a horizontal vibration and vertical load to simulate the passage of trains. The track parameters (or cross levels), before and after stabilising, can be viewed through bogies in the front and rear. Dynamic Track Stabilising has the following advantages, resulting in enhanced safety: * Increases the resistance of the track to lateral movement * Creates a homogenous bed of ballast * Permits earlier relaxation of speed restrictions * Eliminates non-uniform initial differential settlements caused by rail traffic * Retains correct track geometry for a longer period than was achievable using tamping machines alone * Vibration frequency: 30‚Äì35 Hz * Working speed: 1‚Äì2 km/h * Vertical pressure applied: 100 kg/cm¬≤ The stabilisation achieved by one pass of a D.G.S. is equal to that achieved by 100,000 tonnes of traffic, and allows a speed restriction of 20 km/h to be relaxed to 40 km/h Dynamic stabilisation is usually avoided on bridges or around overhead structures since there is a risk of damage to foundations.  Tamping and track layouts  The appropriate tamping procedures and tamping machine depends in part on the track layout. On plain track everything is fairly straight forward and any brand and model of machine can be used. Plasser But through tunnels and bridges with no ballast to tamp, special measures are needed to transition from the ballasted track to the unballasted track. An example would be the Glenbrook Tunnel Turnouts require a more complicated tamping machine with extra and adjustable tongs to cater for the extra rails and variable spacing of the sleepers. Similarly for dual gauge such as between Perth and Northam. Ideally turnouts and diamond crossings should be some distance apart so the each component can be tamped without having to immediately tamp the other components. However a majority of track components are right next to each other so that these components need to be tamped as a group in multiple small stages. Track centres determine whether one end of a crossover, consisting of two turnouts, can be tamped one at a time, with train traffic still running on the other track.

Propaganda is information, ideas, or rumors deliberately spread widely to influence opinions, usually to preserve the self-interest of a nation. It is used in advertising, radio, newspaper, posters, books, television and other media and may provide either factual or non-factual information to its audiences. Domestic World War I The first large-scale use of propaganda by the U.S. government came during World War I. The government enlisted the help of citizens and children to help promote war bonds and stamps to help stimulate the economy. To keep the prices of war supplies down (guns, gunpowder, cannons, steel, etc.), the U.S. government produced posters that encouraged people to reduce waste and grow their own vegetables in \\"victory gardens\\". The public skepticism that was generated by the heavy-handed tactics of the Committee on Public Information would lead the postwar government to officially abandon the use of propaganda.Thomas Howell, The Writers' War Board: U.S. Domestic Propaganda in World War II, Historian, Volume 59 Issue 4, pp. 795‚Äì813 World War II During World War II, the United States officially had no propaganda, but the Roosevelt government used means to circumvent this official line. One such propaganda tool was the publicly owned but government-funded Writers' War Board (WWB). The activities of the WWB were so extensive that it has been called the \\"greatest propaganda machine in history\\". Why We Fight is a famous series of US government propaganda films made to justify US involvement in World War II. Response to the use of propaganda in the United States was mixed, as attempts by the government to release propaganda during World War I was perceived negatively by the American public. The government did not initially use propaganda but was ultimately persuaded by businesses and media, which saw its use as informational. Cultural and racial stereotypes were used in World War II propaganda to encourage the perception of the Japanese people and government as a \\"ruthless and animalistic enemy that needed to be defeated\\", leading to many Americans seeing all Japanese people in a negative light. Many people of Japanese ancestry, most of whom were American citizens,Semiannual Report of the War Relocation Authority, for the period January 1 to June 30, 1946, not dated. Papers of Dillon S.

From 1944‚Äì48, prominent US policy makers promoted a domestic propaganda campaign aimed at convincing the U.S. public to agree to a harsh peace for the German people, for example by removing the common view of the German people and the Nazi Party as separate entities.Steven Casey, (2005), The Campaign to sell a harsh peace for Germany to the American public, 1944 - 1948, [online]. London: LSE Research Online. [Available online at http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/archive/00000736 ] Originally published in History, 90 (297). pp. 62-92 (2005) Blackwell Publishing The core of this campaign was the Writers' War Board, which was closely associated with the Roosevelt administration. Another means was the United States Office of War Information that Roosevelt established in June 1942, whose mandate was to promote understanding of the war policies under the director Elmer Davis. It dealt with posters, press, movies, exhibitions, and produced often slanted material conforming to US wartime purposes. Other large and influential non- governmental organizations during the war and immediate post-war period were the Society for the Prevention of World War III and the Council on Books in Wartime. Cold War Propaganda during the Cold War was at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s in the early years of the Cold War. The United States would make propaganda criticizing and making fun of the enemy the Soviet Union. The propaganda was on movies, television, music, literature and art. The United States officials did not call it propaganda, maintaining they were just telling the accurate information about the world to the people who had different views on things. The television promoted conservative family values and how great it is to live in America. One of the TV shows at the time was called The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. The show was about how being a family in America is great showing the importance of getting an education, respecting your parents and working hard. Propaganda was also in sports. In 1980 the Olympics were in Moscow and the United States boycotted along with Japan, West Germany and many other nations. When the Olympics were held in Los Angeles in 1984 the Soviets did the same as the United States did to them and did not show up for the games. In Education purposes the United States kids watched videos in school; one is called How to Spot a Communist. War on Drugs A poster circa 2000 concerning cannabis in the United States. There was an abundant amount of propaganda in the time Nixon declared war on drugs. One form of propaganda they used, and that is still used today, is the national youth anti-drug media campaign. The government used posters and ads to scare kids and teenagers into saying no to drugs. Nixon initiated the first federal funded programs to begin the prevention of drugs in the U.S. Over the past 40 years, the U.S. has spent over $2.5 trillion fighting the war on drugs. The 1960s gave birth to a rebellious movement that popularized drug use. With many soldiers returning from the war with marijuana and heroin habits there was a strong demand for drugs in the U.S. In June 1971, President Nixon declared a ‚Äúwar on drugs.‚Äù He dramatically increased the presence of federal drug control agencies, and pushed through measures such as mandatory sentencing and no-knock warrants. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was created in 1973 to tackle drug use and the smuggling of illegal narcotics into America. The D.A.R.E. program began in 1983 to educate children on saying no to drugs. By 2003 it cost $230 million and employed 50,000 police officers, but never showed promising results in reducing illegal drug use. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, originally established by the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988,National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988 of the Anti‚ÄìDrug Abuse Act of 1988, but now conducted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy under the Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998,Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 (Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999), is a domestic propaganda campaign designed to \\"influence the attitudes of the public and the news media with respect to drug abuse\\" and for \\"reducing and preventing drug abuse among young people in the United States\\".Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, The Media Campaign cooperates with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and other government and non-government organizations.Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006, , codified at Iraq War In early 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense launched an information operation, colloquially referred to as the Pentagon military analyst program. The goal of the operation is \\"to spread the administrations's talking points on Iraq by briefing ... retired commanders for network and cable television appearances,\\" where they have been presented as independent analysts. On 22 May 2008, after this program was revealed in The New York Times, the House passed an amendment that would make permanent a domestic propaganda ban that until now has been enacted annually in the military authorization bill. The Shared Values Initiative was a public relations campaign that was intended to sell a \\"new\\" America to Muslims around the world by showing that American Muslims were living happily and freely, without persecution, in post-9/11 America. Funded by the United States Department of State, the campaign created a public relations front group known as the Council of American Muslims for Understanding (CAMU). The campaign was divided in phases; the first of which consisted of five mini-documentaries for television, radio, and print with shared values messages for key Muslim countries.  Ad Council  The Ad Council, an American non-profit organization that distributes public service announcements on behalf of various private and federal government agency sponsors, has been labeled as \\"little more than a domestic propaganda arm of the federal government\\" given the Ad Council's historically close collaboration with the President of the United States and the federal government. According to the Ad Council official website they aim to make sure advertisements are not as biased and do not harm any individuals. They have a myriad of published press releases and news articles relaying around different topics in the United States. The Ad Council has a goal to change the lives of people through advertisement through various case studies and real stories. This non-profit organization continues to give public service announcements with the hope to relay information without opinion and raise awareness on issues. The Ad Council continues to distribute announcements from the White House regarding all political information and debates.  COVID-19 Pandemic  In April 2020, President Donald Trump and the United States government played a campaign video for the Republican Party, which was widely regarded as a propaganda video. This video referred to a timeline of the U.S. government's response to the pandemic, only displaying favorable moments. Some commentators and analysts believed that this was to protect President Donald Trump and his government's reputation, especially before the country's 2020 presidential election. Pro-Washington supporters maintained this was to combat widespread media criticism stating that he failed to act quickly enough to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Tourism advertising  International Through several international broadcasting operations, the US disseminates American cultural information, official positions on international affairs, and daily summaries of international news. These operations fall under the International Broadcasting Bureau, the successor of the United States Information Agency, established in 1953. IBB's operations include Voice of America, Radio Liberty, Alhurra and other programs. They broadcast mainly to countries where the United States finds that information about international events is limited, either due to poor infrastructure or government censorship. The Smith-Mundt Act prohibits the Voice of America from disseminating information to US citizens that were produced specifically for a foreign audience. During the Cold War, the United States ran covert propaganda campaigns in countries that appeared likely to become Soviet satellites, such as Italy, Afghanistan, and Chile. According to the Church Committee report, US agencies ran a \\"massive propaganda campaign\\" on Chile, where over 700 news items placed in American and European media resulted from CIA activities in a six-weeks period alone. In 2006, The Pentagon announced the creation of a new unit aimed at spreading propaganda about supposedly \\"inaccurate\\" stories being spread about the Iraq War. These \\"inaccuracies\\" have been blamed on the enemy trying to decrease support for the war. Donald Rumsfeld has been quoted as saying these stories are something that keeps him up at night. Psychological operations PSYOP pamphlet disseminated in Iraq. Text: \\"This is your future al-Zarqawi\\" and shows al-Qaeda fighter al-Zarqawi caught in a rat trap. The US military defines psychological operations, or PSYOP, as: > planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign > audiences to influence the emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and > ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and > individuals. Some argue that the Smith-Mundt Act, adopted in 1948, explicitly forbids information and psychological operations aimed at the US public. However, Emma L. Briant points out that this is a common confusion: the Smith-Mundt Act only ever applied to the State Department, not the Department of Defense and military PSYOP, which are governed by Article 10 of the US Code.Briant, Emma L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester: Manchester University Press: 41 Nevertheless, the current easy access to news and information from around the globe, makes it difficult to guarantee PSYOP programs do not reach the US public. Or, in the words of Army Col. James A. Treadwell, who commanded the U.S. military psyops unit in Iraq in 2003, in The Washington Post: > There's always going to be a certain amount of bleed-over with the global > information environment.Military Plays Up Role of Zarqawi - Jordanian > Painted As Foreign Threat To Iraq's Stability By Thomas E.

Briant brings this up to date, detailing the big changes in practice following 9/11 and especially after the Iraq War as US defense adapted to a more fluid media environment and brought in new internet policies.Briant, Emma L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester: Manchester University Press Several incidents in 2003 were documented by Sam Gardiner, a retired Air Force colonel, which he saw as information-warfare campaigns that were intended for \\"foreign populations and the American public.\\" Truth from These Podia, as the treatise was called, reported that the way the Iraq War was fought resembled a political campaign, stressing the message instead of the truth.

Previously owned by Gawker Media and Univision Communications, it is currently owned by G/O Media. Deadspin posted daily previews, recaps, and commentaries of major sports stories, as well as sports-related anecdotes, rumors, and videos. In addition to covering sports, the site wrote about the media, pop culture, and politics, and published several non-sports sub-sections, including The Concourse and the humor blog Adequate Man. Contrasting with traditional sports updates of other outlets, Deadspin is known for its irreverent, conversational tone, often injecting crude humor into its writing and taking a critical lens to the topics it covered. Over time, the site expanded into more investigative journalism and broke several stories, including the revelation of the Manti Te'o girlfriend hoax. Alumni writers of Deadspin have gone on to work for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Sports Illustrated. During October and November 2019, the website's entire writing and editorial staff resigned due to conflicts with G/O Media management over a directive to \\"stick to sports\\" content only. The website began publishing content again in March 2020. The site has suffered after the mass resignations, reportedly attracting only 10.22% of its previous readership. History Deadspin was founded in December 2005 by editor-in- chief Will Leitch, an author and at that time a founding editor of the New York City-based culture website, \\"The Black Table\\", in his New York City apartment, where he wrote 40 blog posts a day. The blog joined the Gawker Media network of websites. Leitch announced on June 5, 2008, that he would be leaving to take a position at New York. He was replaced by A. J. Daulerio, former senior writer for the site. Author and journalist Drew Magary, formerly a frequent contributor to the site's comments section, joined as an editor and chief columnist in 2008. Time magazine named the site one of the 50 coolest websites of 2006. Deadspin was one of six websites that were purchased by Univision Communications in their acquisition of Gawker Media in August 2016. The Gizmodo Media Group was subsequently formed to operate the properties. The website's masthead consisted of editor-in-chief Megan Greenwell, managing editor Tom Ley, and senior editor Diana Moskovitz, along with a staff of full- time writers and regular contributors. Conflicts with G/O Media management In April 2019, the Gizmodo Media Group was purchased by private equity firm Great Hill Partners and was renamed G/O Media, with Jim Spanfeller appointed as CEO. Greenwell resigned from Deadspin effective August 23, 2019. She cited dysfunction caused by corporate management, attempts by them to intimidate writers out of reporting on it, and undermining and condescending to the site's senior staff. In late October 2019, the editorial staff across several G/O Media sites, including Deadspin, posted articles acknowledging complaints from readers about advertisements that were autoplaying with audio. The Deadspin post said that the editorial staff \\"are as upset with the current state of our site's user experience as [readers] are\\" but that they could not control the \\"ad experience\\". The posts were subsequently removed by G/O Media management. The Gizmodo Media Group (GMG) union, which represents editors and writers across the G/O Media sites and is supported by Writers Guild of America, East, responded to the post removals with a statement that said, \\"We condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.\\" According to The Wall Street Journal, G/O Media enabled the autoplaying ads in an attempt to fulfill the terms of an advertising deal it agreed to with Farmers Insurance Group. The companies had signed a deal worth $1 million that was planned to run from September 2019 ‚Äì 2020 and required G/O Media to deliver 43.5 million impressions. However, after the first few weeks of the campaign, the G/O media and operations teams did not think they could meet that goal and subsequently enabled the ads. Farmers ultimately backed out of the deal on October 30. That same week, G/O Media editorial director Paul Maidment sent a memo to Deadspin employees ordering them to discontinue any content not related to sports. He said that in order to \\"create as much great sports journalism\\" as possible, \\"Deadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\\" The GMG union called the changes in the site's content \\"undermin[ing] the nearly two decades of work writers have put into building a profitable brand with an enormous, dedicated readership\\". On October 29, following the memo, staffers filled the site's front page with non-sports stories that had been among the site's most popular in the past; by that afternoon, interim editor-in-chief Barry Petchesky had been fired for \\"not sticking to sports.\\" As a result of Petchesky's firing, at least ten employees participated in a mass resignation on October 30. Among those who left were Ley,Tom Ley (October 30, 2019) \\".@barry no longer works at Deadspin and that means I no longer work at Deadspin. Bye!\\" writers Albert Burneko, Kelsey McKinney, Patrick Redford, Lauren Theisen, Chris Thompson, and Laura Wagner. Moskovitz also announced her departure, though she had given her two weeks' notice the week prior. Comments on the site were subsequently disabled as well. The GMG union posted a statement saying: \\"Today, a number of our colleagues at Deadspin resigned from their positions. From the outset, CEO Jim Spanfeller has worked to undermine a successful site by curtailing its most well-read coverage because it makes him personally uncomfortable. This is not what journalism looks like, and this is not what editorial independence looks like. 'Stick to sports' is and always been a thinly veiled euphemism for 'don't speak truth to power.' In addition to being bad business, Spanfeller's actions are morally reprehensible.\\" On October 31, Magary and Dan McQuade announced their departures. By November 1, the entire staff of nearly 20 writers and editors had announced their resignations or already departed. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders expressed his support for the editorial staff, tweeting, \\"I stand with the former @Deadspin workers who decided not to bow to the greed of private equity vultures like @JimSpanfeller. This is the kind of greed that is destroying journalism across the country, and together we are going to take them on\\". Maidment resigned from G/O Media on November 5, 2019, stating that it was the \\"right moment\\" to \\"pursue an entrepreneurial opportunity\\". On January 10, 2020, G/O Media announced its decision to move Deadspin operations from New York City to Chicago, where it will operate as part of The Onion. On January 31, 2020, Ley and several other former writers established Unnamed Temporary Sports Blog, an interim site sponsored by Dashlane that operated exclusively over Super Bowl LIV weekend. The site reopened for the week of April 20, sponsored by a cannabis oil company. In July 2020 they subsequently announced a new subscription-based sports and culture website, Defector. The first new content posted to the Deadspin site following the resignations appeared on March 13, 2020, as new editor-in-chief Jim Rich announced that the website was building a new team. New articles began publishing earlier than planned due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting Deadspin broke the story of NFL quarterback Brett Favre's alleged sexual misconduct toward journalist Jenn Sterger. Deadspin also broke the story of Sarah Phillips, a reporter hired by ESPN who lied about her identity and credentials to staffers in order to gain employment. In 2013, Deadspin broke the news that the reported September 2012 death of the girlfriend of Notre Dame All-American linebacker Manti Te'o, which Te'o had said inspired him during the 2012 season, was apparently a hoax. Deadspin found no evidence that the girlfriend had ever existed, much less died. Deadspin received attention for \\"buying\\" a vote for the Baseball Hall of Fame election in 2013. The site announced in late November 2013 that it had acquired a vote from a BBWAA writer which was \\"purchased\\" not through a cash payment to the writer, but instead to a charity of the writer's choice. On January 8, after the Hall of Fame voting was announced, Deadspin revealed that its voter was Miami Herald sportswriter Dan Le Batard. Le Batard was heavily criticized by fellow sportswriters for \\"selling\\" his vote. The BBWAA permanently revoked his Hall of Fame voting privileges and suspended his membership for one year. In 2014, Deadspin provided coverage of the Gamergate controversy, \\"expos[ing] a shocking view of sexism and harassment in the gaming industry to the wider public\\", according to Salon. On October 15, 2014, Deadspin published an article which alleged that Cory Gardner, the Republican who ran for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, had faked his high school football career. Later that day, Gardner tweeted photographic evidence of himself in his football uniform as a teenager, and the main source of the story said the report mischaracterized his comments. Deadspin updated the article with an editor's note which stated the correct information. Conservative blog The Washington Free Beacon criticized the article as a \\"politically-motivated hit.\\" After Deadspin posted an article asking readers to post proof of Ted Cruz playing basketball, Cruz responded by jokingly tweeting a picture of Duke University star Grayson Allen, which then prompted Deadspin to reply with \\"Go eat shit.\\" In July 2017, Deadspin sparked controversy when in response to Senator John McCain's brain cancer diagnosis, Deadspins Twitter account tweeted that the website did not want to \\"hear another fucking word about John McCain unless he dies or does something useful for once.\\" In March 2018, The Concourse posted a video showcasing versions of a controversial \\"journalistic responsibility\\" promo being produced by television stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which helped bring mainstream attention to them. Deadspins former last post each evening (before the October staff resignations), called DUAN (\\"Deadspin Up All Night\\"), was infamous for its occasionally viral and usually wildly diverse commentaries.

He was the younger brother of Sir Edmund Affleck. Affleck held various commands throughout the latter half of the 18th Century, most notably as commander-in- chief of the Jamaica Station and as a Lord of the Board of Admiralty. Early in his career he fought at the Siege of Louisbourg where he was promoted commander after carrying out a successful cutting-out mission. He was promoted to post-captain a year later after impressing Admiral Edward Boscawen during the Battle of Lagos. Later in his career he joined Admiral Sir George Rodney in the West Indies and took part in the capture of Sint Eustatius. Between 1790 and 1792 he held the position of commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station and between 1793 and 1796 he held his position as a Lord of the Board of Admiralty. Although his career was marked with long periods of inaction and unemployment Admiral Affleck was known as a good officer and was well respected by his peers. Early career Affleck began his nautical career in the service of the East India Company. He joined the navy at an undetermined date and was promoted acting-lieutenant in 1755. As a lieutenant he served either in the sloop-of-war or the bomb ketch although as his brother Edmund was serving at almost exactly the same time the records are a little unclear. At the Siege of Louisbourg he distinguished himself in leading the boats that cut out the French men-of-war Prudente and Naval Chronicle, 21 (1809), pp.445-451 and was promoted to command. His promotion to commander was confirmed on 1 August 1759 and Affleck accompanied Edward Boscawen in the 18-gun sloop of war Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.146 to the Mediterranean.

It is located on the grounds of the former Tampines Stadium and Tampines Sports Hall and is part of the development of the Tampines Regional Centre. Built based on feedback from 15,000 residents living in the vicinity, the complex was officially opened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 6 August 2017. The current multi-purpose complex replaced the former Tampines Stadium, Tampines Sports Hall, Tampines Swimming Complex, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) Tampines Branch Office and the Tampines Regional Library, housing them under one roof. History left Our Tampines Hub occupies the grounds of the former sports facilities of Tampines Stadium and Tampines Sports Hall, which was opened in December 1989 in conjunction with the adjacent Tampines Swimming Complex. This coincided with the HDB's plan for opening sporting facilities new housing estates in the late eighties. Tampines Stadium was also the home stadium of the S-League Tampines Rovers Football Club. Plans for a new proposed integrated lifestyle town hub development to be built on the site of Tampines Stadium and Tampines Sports Hall were unveiled on 21 January 2011, and was part of the Tampines Masterplan for 2011-2015. On 11 May 2013, a groundbreaking ceremony led by Members of Parliament for Tampines GRC was held at the former Tampines Stadium for what was to be for an integrated-community and sports facility on what was then known as Tampines Town Hub. By July that year, Tampines Stadium had been completely demolished. Construction commenced on 1 June 2014. The official name of \\"Tampines Town Hub\\" was unveiled as Our Tampines Hub on 30 August 2015 with more than 2,000 residents in attendance. Residents also received updates and progress on the features and facilities offered. Residents also had a chance to vote and decide on the hub's logo. OTH opened in three stages, becoming fully operational on 6 August 2017. Facilities The building houses six different swimming pools that satisfy families as well as sportspeople, one of which is the largest rooftop pool in Singapore. It also houses a playground and the Tampines Regional Library. Public Services Centre OTH features a Public Services Centre, where residents have access to government services and assistance at a common location. It houses a 24/7 e-service lobby offering services from six different agencies: namely People‚Äôs Association, North East Community Development Council, Housing Development Board, Workforce Singapore, Ministry of Social and Family Development, and ActiveSG. Town Square The \\"Town Square\\" in July 2017 Formerly known as Tampines Stadium, the main feature of OTH, the Town Square is a 5,000 seater stadium with a FIFA-endorsed \\"2 Star Quality Pro football pitch\\". The artificial turf can be used for both football and rugby matches, and also for other community events. After 6 years of vacating Tampines Stadium for the construction of OTH, Tampines Rovers Football Club returned to their home ground with much fanfare. The pitch saw its first football match on July 2017, with Tampines Rovers beating Brunei DPMM, 2-0. Tampines Rovers temporarily played at Clementi Stadium and Jurong West Stadium while OTH was under construction.

It was created and written by Douglas Livingstone. Two series of ten episodes each were made between 1991 and 1992. Although never achieving mainstream success, the series has since gathered a dedicated cult following. Plot The series dealt with the life of Reg Toomer (Tim Healy), an ex-pat Briton living in Australia and running Melbourne Confidential, a failing private detective agency with his shifty business partner Dennis Tontine (Chris Haywood). His estranged young cousin Leslie (Mark Haddigan) arrives in Melbourne from the United Kingdom after a painful divorce looking for fun and excitement in the new world, instead he finds himself used as a drone for Melbourne Confidential. Each episode focused on a particular job undertaken by Melbourne Confidential, each one more elaborate and of more dubious legality than the last. The course of the main plot would often converge with subplots involving Reg's lovelorn wife Doris (Pat Thomson), assertive daughter Arlene (Nadine Garner), Dennis' ex-wife Corrie (Kirsty Child) and kindly madam Delilah (Kris McQuade).

The show first aired on October 5, 1970 on Cincinnati PBS member station WCET and three years later was carried on PBS across the United States, where it ran until 1999. Yoga presenter Lilias Folan (born 1936) began to practice yoga as exercise in 1964, and was soon teaching at the YWCA in Stamford, Connecticut. She studied asanas under the yoga masters T. K. V. Desikachar, B. K. S. Iyengar, and Angela Farmer, and gained wider knowledge of yoga under the Sivananda Yoga masters Swami Vishnudevananda and Swami Satchidananda. She joined the Connecticut ashram of the Divine Life Society led by Swami Chidananda. In the 1980s she met Swami Muktananda, creator of Siddha Yoga, who told her to teach meditation. Through her show she became known to Americans as the \\"First Lady of Yoga\\". She is married with two sons and seven grandchildren. Lilias! Yoga Gets Better With Age WCET premiered Lilias!

This is one of only two warbler genera that are well represented in the latter continent. Some species formerly considered in this genus are now placed in the genus Myiothlypis. It is likely that the ancestors of this genus colonised South America from the family's heartland in northern Central America even before the two continents were linked, and subsequent speciation provided most of the resident warbler species of that region. These are mainly robust warblers with a stout bill. The majority of species have olive or grey upperparts and yellow underparts. The head is often strikingly marked with a long broad supercilium, a coloured crown or crown stripes, and often other striking head markings. Many species are not well-studied, but those for which the breeding habits are known all build a domed nest on a bank or on the ground, so this is presumably typical of the genus as a whole.

The use of sophisticated compositional techniques, as well as complicated harmony writing such as fugue can often be heard in his work, demonstrating his solid training in the western classical music.

Tuffeau stone ‚Äî in French, simply tuffeau or tufeau ‚Äî is a local limestone of the Loire Valley of France. It is characterized as a chalky or sandy, fine-grained limestone, white to yellowish-cream in appearance, and micaceous (containing some white flakes of mica, or muscovite). The soft stone is extracted from numerous quarries and has made a major mark on the architectural landscape of the Loire and its tributaries ‚Äî especially the valley's world-famous chateaux. Geology Tuffeau dates to the Mesozoic era (Upper Cretaceous Turonian stage). The Loire Valley formed the floor of a vast sea 90 million years ago. Over the millennia, sediment from the sea floor, comprising fossilized living organisms and sand particles, became compressed to form what is now known as Tuffeau stone. It differs from genuine chalk by the presence of foraminifera and many remains of shells originally deposited in shallow water (between 2 and 20 meters) and subsequently agitated, near a coastline. In contrast, true chalk is rich in another type of shelly micro-fossil, the coccolith, which was deposited in deeper (~ 200 meters), and quieter, water. The term tuffeau is etymologically related to another stone, tuff, to which is it not geologically related ‚Äî and to tufa, to which it is geologically related. These words derive from Italian tufo and from Latin t≈çphus or t≈çfus (\\"stone\\"). Physical properties Tuffeau has a very low density compared with many other rocks, being half as dense as granite, comparable in density with ebony, and only about 10 to 20% heavier than water. It has porosity of up to 50%, whereas that of granite is only about 1%. The compressive strength of the stone is a factor of 10 to 20 times less than that of granite. When mixed with local sand and flinty clays from later eras, tuffeau is said to create the best vineyards soils. Mining Bourr√© Tuffeau mining reached its peak in the 15th century. As a construction material ‚Äî especially in the Touraine and Anjou regions ‚Äî tuffeau has been extracted mostly from natural riverside bluffs, which are extensive. The extracted blocks could thus be loaded onto boats. Over the centuries, this has created extensive underground galleries, or mines, some of which are several kilometers in extent. These artificial caves have long been used as human dwellings, as the indoor temperature is remarkably constant from summer to winter. The greatest concentration of these cave dwellers ‚Äî les troglodytes ‚Äî is in the region of Saumur. Typical cave dwelling in a tuffeau bluff in Montr√©sor The mines are a perfect environment for wine cellars. Many of the larger caves have become champignonnieres ‚Äî i.e., are used for growing a commercial variety of mushroom, which is transported daily to the markets of Paris. Architecture The visual appeal of tuffeau is amply evident at the celebrated Chateau de Chambord Numerous buildings in the Loire Valley, from the most modest to the most grandiose, were built from blocks of tuffeau stone, including the Ch√¢teau de Beaulieu near Saumur, the Ch√¢teau d'Uss√© and the Ch√¢teau de la Motte d'Usseau, and many worker's cottages at Long√®res.

Carrancistas Revolutionary followers of Venustiano Carranza from 1913 to 1914, and thereafter the Government army from 1914 until his death in 1920. In 1915, an insurgent group known as the Seditionistas was formed and supported by the Carrancistas. Constitucionalistas (Constitutionalists) Title first used by all anti-Huerta forces before the 1914 breakaway of Pancho Villa following the defeat of Victoriano Huerta. Venustiano Carranza, the \\"First Chief\\" of the Revolution, attracted talented generals to his faction, most especially √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. Obreg√≥n defeated Villa's Divisi√≥n del Norte in the Battle of Celaya, ending Villa as a national force. The Constitutionalists were the winner faction of the Revolution, with Carranza becoming president of Mexico and the Mexican Constitution of 1917, drafted by this winning faction in a constitutional convention at Quer√©taro, was promulgated. Convencionistas Joint name for Villistas and Zapatistas as supporters of the Convention of Aguascalientes; held in October-November 1914, which attempted to marginalize Carranza and assert its legitimacy in power following the ouster of Huerta in July 1914. Federales Term used for all Government troops from Mexican independence in 1821 to 1914, but usually associated particularly with Victoriano Huerta's Federal Army. (Huerta was President from February 1913 to July 1914). The Federal Army was disbanded in August 1914 following Huerta's resignation and exile. Felicistas Adherents of Felix Diaz, nephew of former president Porfirio D√≠az, who opposed both the Madero and Carranza governments in rebellions between 1913 and 1920, and led the reactionary conservative National Reorganizer Army in ineffective revolts late in the Revolution. Huertistas Followers of the dictator Victoriano Huerta. Generally considered clones of their leader, never worked without their leader's command, known to intrigue with the Germans in order to keep or regain power. Maderistas Name given to various revolutionary armies fighting under the umbrella leadership of Francisco I. Madero in 1910-11, during the first part of the war. Maderistas in the postrevolutionary phase of Mexican history sought to keep alive the memory of Madero, who was martyred during the February 1913 Ten Tragic Days. Magonistas The military wing of the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM) under the leadership of the Flores-Magon brothers, who organised abortive local uprisings against Diaz in 1906 and 1908, and fomented further revolts after 1911, particularly in Baja California. A force of Magonistas was led by the Welsh soldier of fortune General Carol Ap Rhys Pryce, the \\"Gringo Revolutionary\\" . Orozquistas (Colorados) Followers of Pascual Orozco, also known as the Colorados (\\"Red Flaggers\\"). They fought first for Madero, 1910-11, and revolted against his government in 1912 under the Plan Orozquista, before joining the Huerta army in February 1913. Porfiristas Supporters of long-time Mexican dictator Porfirio D√≠az. The Porfiristas were generally conservative, experienced bureaucrats (popularly known as cientificos or scientists) and soldiers of the Diaz regime. After the fall of Diaz, many Porfiristas made intrigues with Reyistas, Huertistas, and Felicistas. Reyistas Supporters of long time military man and politician General Bernardo Reyes. Reyes and Reyistas participated in the plotting of the coup to overthrow Madero in La decena tragica of February 1913, in which both Madero and Reyes were killed. Villistas Followers of Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa, mainly serving in the Divisi√≥n del Norte (Northern Division). Formed part of the Maderista forces, and later fought in opposition to the Huerta and Carranza governments, the Villistas later formed a spatially isolated alliance with the Zapatistas, who remained in Morelos. Villa's men were mostly made up of vaquero and charro caudillos, rancheros, shopkeepers, miners, migrant farm workers, unemployed workers, railway workers, and Maderista bureaucrats, who seized haciendas and fought for an undefined socialism. Adolfo Gilly wrote that Villismo, though fighting for land redistribution and justice, did not challenge capitalist relations as previously set down during the Porfirio era, but was merely an outgrowth of the bourgeois state-oriented revolution of Madera. Zapatistas Followers of Emiliano Zapata, based in Morelos state from 1911 until his death in 1919. They fought for Madero until Zapata became disillusioned with his policies, and thereafter in opposition to all Mexican governments until their leader's death in 1919. The Zapatistas fought for radical land redistribution and political autonomy, and rallied behind the anarchist demand, ¬°Tierra y Libertad!.

They have been listening to his phone calls for years without hearing anything incriminating, and the recordings made by Pussy Bonpensiero also reveal nothing. Using Pussy's file number, CW16, Agent Skip Lipari says that he is \\"probably compost\\"; Agent Frank Cubitoso removes Pussy's photograph from the wall and throws it away. Lipari reports that Tony goes to his basement to talk with his associates, believing the conversations will be masked by the noise of the central air conditioning units. They obtain legal authorization to plant a listening device there. Once a week the house is empty for long enough for the agents to examine the basement and later install the listening device. The first week they enter and find an old reading lamp in which a microphone could be hidden. They take pictures of it so they can replace it with a replica with a hidden listening device. In the second week their plan is aborted when the house's water heater explodes and the basement is flooded. In the third week, they successfully plant the replacement lamp and start listening. Meadow adjusts to life at Columbia University. Her volatile roommate, Caitlin, is having a hard time. Tony and the crew eat lunch in the back room of Satriale's. Patsy Parisi is not eating, mourning his identical twin Philly on their birthday. Patsy suspects that Tony had something to do with Philly's death. One afternoon, while the FBI watches Tony's house, they see a drunken Patsy on the pool patio aiming a gun at Tony through the window. Patsy can see Tony clearly in the house, but lowers the gun, turns around, and urinates in the pool. Tony does not see any of this. Some days later, Tony confronts Patsy when they are alone. He tells him that the past is past; he compels and cajoles him into declaring, twice, that he has put his grief behind him.

As a spin-off of the Might and Magic franchise, Legends has a fantasy theme. Reviews likened the game to a medieval Counter-Strike, but criticized it for being a mediocre clone.  Gameplay  Gameplay in Legends is almost entirely online. An offline practice mode exists, but the game does not provide bots to simulate actual gameplay conditions. Players pick a server, and then choose from six classes of either the evil team or the good team. The evil team consists of the Heretic, Archer and Warrior, and the good team of the Paladin, Druid and Sorceress. The players then enter a map. Each map exhibits one of four game types: *Sword in the Stone: Each team must attempt to gain control of the sword and reach the exit. It is essentially a variation of one-flag CTF. *Rescue the Princess: The good team must try to save a princess who is guarded by the evil team. This mode is similar to the hostage rescue mode in Counter-Strike. *Warlord Escape: A player assumes the role of the warlord, who must be escorted by the others to safety. This is nearly identical to the VIP missions in Counter-Strike. *Slay the Dragon: Both teams battle in a map containing a fire-breathing dragon. The team that kills the dragon wins the match. In addition to the opposing team, hostile creatures may be present for players to fight (the host of each game decides whether or not there will be monsters). By killing monsters and opening treasure chests found on the map, and also by winning rounds, players earn gold with which to buy equipment. Players lose these items when they die or at the end of a match, whichever comes first. This was another flaw attributed to the game; as players lose everything once matches end and start with only basic gear at the start of each new one, there was no long-term reward and no way for more experienced players to gauge their skill against the less experienced. History Legends of Might and Magic was announced at the 2000 E3 by 3DO as the first Might and Magic game designed for online play. At the time, it was intended to be an Action/RPG that focused on co-operative multiplayer. With up to six players able to join up, the game was not as extensive as MMORPGs of the time, but it also included 16-player deathmatch, a random adventure generator, and a player vs. monster arena. The game would allow characters to choose one of six classes with differing proficiencies in might and magic before embarking on a quest to collect four artifacts from four worlds to defeat the deranged advisor to the king before he can alter history. The assignments given to the players would depend on their level and how far they had progressed. By the beginning of 2001, however, the game had abandoned the Action/RPG elements and had become a deathmatch game, with six proposed gameplay modes, 25 maps from Might and Magic history, and the ability for weapons, skills, abilities, and equipment to carry over between games. The move was defended by Executive Producer Jeffrey Blattner, who said: > \\"We got to a certain checkpoint some time ago and examined what we had. One > thing we pride ourselves on at New World is the gameplay, and we just didn't > feel like we would be able to deliver a fun experience for people with what > we had at the time, so at that point a decision was made to not proceed in > the original direction, and instead we decided to make a different type of > game,\\" explains Executive Producer Jeffrey Blattner. \\"The Might and Magic > series is already so varied in terms of gameplay anyway. We have the Heroes > strategy series and the tried and true Might and Magic RPG series, and > everyone was really interested in branching out into an action style game, > so that's how we found ourselves here. The original goal of Legends was to > deliver the first online Might and Magic game, and we're still going to do > that.\\" A demo for the game was released on April 18, 2001. On June 8 it went gold. The first patch (Version 1.1) came out on July 20.  Reception  Critical reviews Legends of Might and Magic was likened to a fantasy version of Counter-Strike by most reviewers; according to IGN, Legends \\"pretty much blatantly rips off Counter-Strike.\\" IGN also criticized the game for its lack of strategy, lack of differences between classes, and unbalanced weapons. GameSpy criticized the game for its poor implementation of single-player gameplay and lack of a map editor. The LithTech-based graphics were praised, however, and the game was said to have potential to grow. GameSpot criticized the game for its uninspired similarities to Counter-Strike, oping that \\"if mediocrity and complacency were crimes, Legends of Might and Magic would get tossed in the dungeon.\\" A compilation of reviews on GameRankings showed the game had an average score of 57% based on 15 reviews. It has an aggregate score of 53% on Metacritic. Carla Hacker reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Unoriginal and uninspiring, this team-based FPS is not the stuff of legends.\\" References External links * Category:2001 video games Category:Lithtech engine games Category:New World Computing games Category:The 3DO Company games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Might and Magic spin-off games ","title":"Legends of Might and Magic"},{"id":"4523540","text":"\\"I Could Not Love You More\\" is a song by the Bee Gees.

During his career as musician and composer, Andrew had three platinum albums and two hit singles. His songs have been used in numerous major motion picture soundtracks and documentaries. Music career Andrew was born in Taft, California. As the son of a military father, Andrew moved a great deal as a child. He developed a skill for music at a very early age. By the time he was seventeen living in Okinawa, he already had his own band, called the \\"Cool Notes\\", and his own weekly TV show, an Okinawan version of American Bandstand. His early influences were Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard. He also listened to a great deal of Delta blues. His brother Leland Andrew frequently stated his brother was the \\"Benny Goodman of Japan\\". Shortly after he graduated from high school, his father was transferred to Hamilton Air Force Base in northern California. It was during this period that he started attending classes at the University of San Francisco, becoming involved with the San Francisco folk music scene of the early 1960s. However it was not until he returned from a two-year stay in Europe, over a year in Paris and almost a year in Germany, that he met Peter Albin at 1090 Page Street. As Big Brother and the Holding Company began to gel, Andrew brought many songs into the band. He has been a prolific songwriter all of his life, penning his first tune at the age of six. Of his early compositions, \\"Call on Me\\" and \\"Combination of the Two\\" have been two of Big Brother's most enduring classic tracks. Until his illness in early 2015 Andrew continued in his original role as the musical director of the band. Janis Joplin was recruited by band manager Chet Helms to join Big Brother as lead singer on June 4, 1966. They soon landed a record contract, issuing their first album on Mainstream and their second ‚Äì a top seller ‚Äì on Columbia Records. Andrew and original bandmate James Gurley were known for their searing, psychedelic guitar work. In February 1997, Guitar Player magazine listed Andrew's and Gurley's work on \\"Summertime\\" as one of the top ten psychedelic solos in music history. On September 11, 2001, Andrew was to be presented with a High Times magazine Life Time Achievement award. That day his flight to New York City was canceled, and instead he received the award the next year. In December 1968, Andrew and Joplin left Big Brother and the Holding Company to form the Kozmic Blues Band. After about nine months and one album, I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!, Andrew returned to Big Brother. After Big Brother stopped performing in 1972, he moved to New York City, where he studied harmony and counterpoint at the New School for Social Research and composition at Mannes School of Music. During this period he also scored several films in the US and Canada as well as writing two string quartets and a symphony. He remained in New York City for eight years before returning to San Francisco, where he began playing clarinet and saxophone. Big Brother and the Holding Company reunited in 1987. During the 1990s, in addition to touring with Big Brother, Andrew was involved with his solo project, The Sam Andrew Band. It toured across North America, and the spoken word quartet Theatre of Light, that besides Andrew, featured The Vagabond Poet, Tony Seldin, keyboardist Tom Constanten and harpist-pianist Elise Piliwale. He also played several dates with the band Moby Grape and more recently with the band the Former Members featuring Greg Douglass, Roy Blumenfeld, David Bennett ‚Äì Cohen and Bruce Barthol. Andrew was the Music Director of the musical Love, Janis, based on the life of Janis Joplin, written and directed by Randal Myler and based on the book by Laura Joplin of the same name. He also performed at the 40th Anniversary of Woodstock Concert on August 15, 2009 at Bethel Woods, New York. Personal life and death Andrew lived in northern California with his wife Elise Piliwale. He had one daughter, Mari Andrew, from his marriage to Suzanne Thorson. He died in San Francisco, California on February 12, 2015, following complications from open-heart surgery due to a heart attack suffered ten weeks prior.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The name of the rulers of the castle was first mentioned in 1131. The castle itself may date back to the 10th century but the 11th or 12th century is more likely.Swisscastles.ch - Trachselwald accessed 15 December 2014 At first it belonged to the barons of Trachselwald, then to the barons of R√ºti bei Lyssach, and then those of Sumiswald. The barons of Sumiswald sold the castle and surrounding lands to the city of Bern. Bern turned the castle into a sheriffhood. The castle was rebuilt or expanded several times. Its oldest parts are the keep, which was built out of tuff, and one half of the main building. These parts of the castle were built in the second half of the 12th century. The stair tower was probably built by a master craftsman from Prismell in 1641. During the Swiss peasant war of 1653, the peasant leader Niklaus Leuenberger, who was arrested on June 19, 1653 was held in Castle Trachselwald until being taken to Bern, where he was executed on August 27. The castle was sacked during the 1798 French invasion, but was not burned. It became the center of administration of the district of Trachselwald. Castle site The first castle consisted of a square keep that was about on each side. The walls were up to thick. The keep and outer walls are made of tuff stone cut into roughly squared blocks which indicates construction before 1200. The dendrochronology dating of the beams indicates that they came from 1251 to 1253. Along with the keep, part of the main building was added during the first construction period.Burgenwelt.de website, Trachselwald Castle History accessed 26 March 2012 The original keep was probably surrounded by an elliptical ring wall. In the 14th century the original two story keep doubled in height. In the 16th or 17th century a palas, dungeon and other buildings were added to the castle.Gesellschaft f√ºr Schweizerische Kunstgeschichte GSK accessed 15 December 2014 The new additions were built in a Romanesque style, which included larger windows and thinner walls. A stair tower was added in 1641 and a granary was built in 1683. The palas was renovated during the 17th and 18th century into its current appearance. In 1751 a new, more decorative gate house was built along with a french garden.

About 25 years later, in the same place, again almost all people passing by know Cayouche and his character. Thanks to his first album, Cayouche made a phenomenal entry into the music market in Acadia. Reaching a sales figure of more than 15,000 copies in a fairly small market, the album \\"Un vieux hippy\\" is surely part of the disco of most Acadian families. Cayouche, a very simple musician, sings the everyday routine in his slightly coarse voice. Shortly after the release of the album ‚ÄúUn vieux hippie‚Äù, fans who attended his shows could sing their hearts out to all of the lyrics of his songs such as ‚ÄúLa chain de mon Tracteur‚Äù, ‚ÄúExporter‚Äú A ‚Äùor even \\"The kids kick\\". The album \\"An Old Hippy\\" surely contains many of the new classics of Acadian songs. Especially known for his uniting and festive performances, the singer has maintained a constant popularity throughout Canada and Europe. The ‚ÄúCayouche phenomenon‚Äù gets people from all generations singing and dancing, touching the hearts of the young and old in almost every song. He is among the few Acadian popular artists in history to have sold more 100,000 albums. Among his biggest hits are Export A, La chaine de mon tracteur, L‚Äôalcool au Volant, C‚Äôest √ßa mon Acadie and La reine du bingo. Cayouche, who now lives in Maisonnette, New Brunswick, was the subject of a documentary film entitled \\"Cayouche, Le Temps d'une bi√®re\\" or in English: \\"Cayouche : Time for a beer‚Äù by Maurice Andr√© Aubin in 2009.

Monthly forums For the next 3 years, to 1996, People Like Us held monthly Sunday forums. A topic would be chosen and a lead speaker found. But the part which participants enjoyed most was always the break-out sessions. Forum attendees would divide themselves into smaller groups to flesh out these issues on a more personal and intimate level. Topics varied widely, and included coming out of the closet, the law, insurance for singles, housing and safe sex. More light-hearted ones like \\"homosexuals and beauty\\" were also dealt with. The Substation Most Sundays, somewhere between 40 and 80 people turned up. This may seem few today, but was remarkable considering that it was before the Internet age, and its existence was only known by mouth, and the great majority of homosexual Singaporeans were probably too stigmatised to reveal their sexual orientation.

He was the son of Stracimir Bal≈°iƒá, and succeeded his paternal uncle Bal≈°a II in ruling Zeta. He reigned from 1386 up to 1389 in the still officially undissolved Serbian Empire in the form of a family alliance, then up to 1395 as an Ottoman vassal. He ruled until his death in 1403, when he was succeeded by his only son, Bal≈°a III. He is known in Serbian epic poetry as Strahinja Banoviƒá. Background and early life His father was Stracimir, one of the three Bal≈°iƒá brothers who came to rule Zeta in the 1360s. His mother was Milica Mrnjavƒçeviƒá (Jerina), the daughter of Serbian King Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá. Accession Ulcinj Fortress of ƒêuraƒë II 270px On 18 September 1385, ƒêuraƒë's uncle Bal≈°a II was killed at the Battle of Savra, while fighting the Ottomans. Following the temporary rule under Bal≈°a II's widow Komnena and daughter Ruƒëina, ƒêuraƒë II inherited parts of Zeta and northern Albania, including the cities of Scutari, Drivast and Lezh√´, as per the Bal≈°iƒás' traditional rule of seniority, as \\"self-holder to the Zeta and Coast land\\". ƒêuraƒë II had his seat at Ulcinj, which also became the family seat. The remainder of the Bal≈°iƒá possessions, in southern Albania, passed in 1391 from Ruƒëina to her spouse Mrk≈°a ≈Ωarkoviƒá, the son of ≈Ωarko, Emperor Du≈°an's nobleman. The protovestijar Philip Bareli, the Venetian trader that handled Bal≈°a's financing, who was succeeded by ƒêuraƒë, is also mentioned as holding estates. According to Mavro Orbini, when ƒêuraƒë II started his rule, \\"the tribes of Upper Zeta and the Crnojeviƒá did not want to recognize him, answering that they were under the Bosnian King Tvrtko\\". ƒêuraƒë had succeeded leadership in the heats of disarray. Pal Dukagjini broke off allegiance to ƒêuraƒë, taking Lezh√´ and the Drin area. Finally the Jonima family seceded with their own lands between Durr√´s and the Drin, causing ƒêuraƒë to lose his very last possessions in Albania. Before even consolidating rule, Karlo Thopia conquered Durr√´s and assigned it to his son George, Nikola Sakat, the castellan of Budva, and his brother Andrija seceded the city after 1386 and Vuk Brankoviƒá took Peƒá and Prizren. ƒêuraƒë asked Dukagjini for an advice, and according to it, he had the Sakat brothers imprisoned and blinded. In the Zeta plains themselves under Lovƒáen, ƒêuraƒë had constant conflicts with the opposing ruler of Upper Zeta, Radiƒç Crnojeviƒá, whose family had just come to prominence. The area of Onogo≈°t (Nik≈°iƒá) seceded to the Venetians. In a short time, ƒêuraƒë's demesne had diminished into a small strip of land between Lake Skadar and the Adriatic Sea. Upon proclaiming himself the sole head of the Bal≈°iƒá family, he issued an official edict on 28 January 1386 in Scutari, calling his reign's strength upon \\"..the prayers and martyrs of my holy forefathers Symeon, the Nemanya, the first Serbian Myhrr-flowing, and Sava the Saint\\" of his kin.Monumenta Serbica, Franz von Miklosich In it he also stated that the laws of the Serbian lords, his predecessors Stracimir, ƒêuraƒë and Bal≈°a, and in specific of Emperor Du≈°an, shall remain and be valid for his reign. It was a standard remark of the ruler's calling upon divine right and inspired by the heritage of the Serbian Medieval state, now in feudal disarray.History of Montenegro, Second Book, From the end of XII to the end of XV Century, Volume Two, Montenegro in the Age of Regional Lords.

Marko ≈†uica, Belgrade, 2000. Serbian alliance From the start of his reign, ƒêuraƒë faced the potential threat from the powerful expansionist Ottoman Empire. To strengthen political links, he married Jelena (b. 1368), daughter of the Serbian Moravian lord Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá, after recognizing Lazar as his sovereign in 1386. The folklore has recorded that ƒêuraƒë was at war with Prince Lazar for three times before a peaceful union was achieved, although there is no historical confirmation. Prince Lazar aimed at maintaining the heritage of the dispersing Serbian Empire. ƒêuraƒë, Lazar, and Lord Vuk Brankoviƒá of Kosovo formed a family alliance to govern the renewed Serbian realm, presided over by Lazar. The three also shared the annual tax paid to Serbian lords by the Republic of Ragusa. Each member retained some autonomy, however, as can be seen through ƒêuraƒë's styling of himself as \\"I, Bal≈°iƒá in Christ the Lord, ƒêuraƒë, pious and autocratic lord of the lands of Zeta and the coast.\\" Edicts for the realm were issued commonly by all three lords, extending Serbia to some form of a level of a Triarchy, or even Diarchy, considering Vuk's considerably subordinate status to Lazar.History of the Serbian People, Group of Authors (Sima ƒÜirkoviƒá,....) ƒêuraƒë also maintained diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. ƒêuraƒë owes his position and everlasting presence on the scene to his political cunningness. He succeeded the traditional rivalry between his family and Bosnian-Serbian King Tvrtko I Kotromaniƒá, whose Serbian crown the Bal≈°iƒás did not recognize, most probably because of their own claims to the Serbian throne1. On his diplomatic initiative, the Ottomans invaded Bosnia in 1386. During a second attack, ƒêuraƒë even sent his own troops to support the Ottoman Beylerbey of Rumelia Lala ≈û√¢hin Pa≈üa at the Battle of Bileƒáa on 27 August 1388, where he suffered a defeat to the hands of Bosnian Duke Vlatko Vukoviƒá Kosaƒça. This led to the suspicion that ƒêuraƒë was an Ottoman vassal. The Ragusan Republic was weary of this Ottoman expansion, so they wanted to negotiate with ƒêuraƒë some military protection. On 23 August 1388 ƒêuraƒë sent his envoy ≈Ωanin Bareli, Filip's son. Legends record ƒêuraƒë running with his forces to join the Serbian allied forces at the 1389 Battle of Kosovo and returning after he heard the news about the fall; however this is very improbable if his links to the Ottomans in that period are accounted for. The Epic telling records \\"Bao≈°\\" coming late on the 3rd day to the Kosovo Field after the battle and how he was furious at the alleged traitor \\"Duke Vukan Brankoviƒá\\". Also the wrong daughter of \\"Emperor Lazar\\", Olivera Despina, was remembered as married to ƒêuraƒë. Most historians and scholars identify him as the Serbian Epic hero Banoviƒá Strahinja, due to the close similarities in name and characteristics.Analysis of the Poem 'Banovic Strahinja' In any case, after the Battle of Kosovo, the Serbian Alliance crumbled and the last remains of the Serbian Empire dispersed, leaving ƒêuraƒë completely on his own. Zeta on its own In 1390 Vuk Brankoviƒá sent envoys to Zeta and offered 500 liters of silver to Philip Bareli to hand over last ƒêuraƒë's bastion, the City of Ulcinj. Fearing the occasion, ƒêuraƒë had him immediately imprisoned together with his children.Istorija Crne Gore, Ivan Bo≈æiƒá During his rule, ƒêuraƒë, like his predecessors, tried to find an effective modus vivendi for extending his rule over the City of Kotor. As the richest and most economically developed city on the southern Adriatic coast close to Zeta, it fueled the rivalry between King Tvrtko and ƒêuraƒë. For these reasons no friendship between the two was created, even after peaceful relations were concluded in early 1389 on mediation of the Republic of Ragusa. When Tvrtko died in the beginning of March 1391, the opportunity arose for ƒêuraƒë and he subsequently seized Kotor. From the start of ƒêuraƒë's reign he had to face with the outlaw of his cousin Konstantin, administrator of the lands in the rivers of Bojana and Drin, who didn't accept his supremacy in the Bal≈°iƒás' lands. It is believed that Filip Bareli had connections with Konstantin, so he was convicted for committing the highest felony, a \\"crime against ƒêuraƒë's authority\\" and all of his plentiful property was confiscated by ƒêuraƒë. Konstantin went into Ottoman service and since 1390 under protection of Sultan Bayezid I actively worked to seize power as the Head Bal≈°iƒá. As a result, ƒêuraƒë came into fierce opposition to the Ottomans in 1391, converted to Catholicism from Serbian Orthodoxy, and promised his lands in heritage to Pope Boniface IX in the case of no heir apparent. Clearly siding with the Christian coalition under the legal Papal States in conflict with the Avignonese Antipope Clement VII, ƒêuraƒë took the side of Louis II of Anjou in his war against Ladislaus of Naples. But the broader plans for organizing a crusade against Turks have remained but a dream. Fresco of ƒêuraƒë II Bal≈°iƒá ƒêuraƒë received a border with the Ottoman Empire as they took the lands of Vuk Brankoviƒá in 1392. For opposition to Turkish influence in the region, the Sultan sent an army to invade his lands in May 1392. At the same time in the heat of fighting his competitors Radiƒç Crnojeviƒá and Konstantin Bal≈°iƒá, ƒêuraƒë was forced to negotiate with the Ottomans for peace terms. In order to protect his wife Jelena from the Ottoman danger ƒêuraƒë decided to send her to Dubrovnik in June 1392. He negotiated with Pasha Yiƒüit Bey, sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Skopje, but the talks were fruitless as the Ottoman demanded half of all his territories around Zeta, including his seat of Ulcinj. In addition to that, in late 1392 the bey managed to capture ƒêuraƒë in a battle and released him only after the ransom was paid. When ƒêuraƒë was in captivity Radiƒç Crnojeviƒá captured his lands around Kotor and proclaimed himself Lord of Zeta and Budva. His wife Jelena was making moves to free him, with the help of the Venetian Republic, but they all reached a moot end. One of the main reasons for that was that his opponent Radiƒç Crnojeviƒá expanded his reign vastly and became a Venetian vassal in November 1392. The possibility of this was ƒêuraƒë's reluctance to release Philip Bareli, a Venetian citizen, despite many pleas from the Republic. In the heat of struggle amongst feudal lords in Zeta, Philip managed in 1392 to flee from his prison to Durr√´s, coming into John Thopia's service. On the other side King Stjepan Dabi≈°a dispatched Bosnian Duke Sandalj Hraniƒá from the Hum to take over ƒêuraƒë's lands and further agitate Radiƒç Crnojeviƒá. Having no other choice, ƒêuraƒë handed over to bey ≈û√¢hin the cities of Scutari and Drivast and the Forum of Sveti Srƒë on the Bojana River to the Turks, as well as agreed to pay annual taxes in exchange for his release. Ottoman squadrons occupied the locations in early 1393. The same year he tried to claim his old Lezh√´ which was just handed over by the Dukagjinis to the Venetians, but Radiƒç's support of Venetian control proved crucial. Seeing the necessity of Venetian support, he managed to get accepted into its citizenry in May 1395. ƒêuraƒë did not rest for long, and already in October 1395 he broke the deal while the Ottomans were at war against the Hungarians and Wallachians, restored Scutari and Sveti Srƒë and even defeated his rival Konstantin by seizing his stronghold of Danj, with Venetian assistance. To keep his cities safe, ƒêuraƒë relied upon the rivalry between Turkey and Venice. He handed over the cities into Venetian administration. When Ottoman advances obviously came to a halt, the Venetians decided to negotiate the deal. In April 1396 a contract was signed. ƒêuraƒë handed over Scutari, the Skadar Lake with all its islands and Sveti Srƒë to Venetian administration, as well as agreed to channel the income from tolls in Danj, in exchange for 1,000 ducats every year. He also promised to give the cities support in case of a Turkish attack and was accepted into Venetian nobility. The whole act was typical for weak lords facing the mighty Ottoman Empire in the coastline of the western Balkans. ƒêuraƒë remained to rule directly just a small territory west of the Bojana river with Bar and Ulcinj as the only cities. In 1396 Koja Zakarija from the Sakat family came to power in northern Albania centered in Danj, independently from ƒêuraƒë. Zeta's rebirth At the end of April 1396, Radiƒç and his brother Dobrivoje Crnojeviƒá had made a significant move against ƒêuraƒë. They took Grbalj and laid siege to Kotor. ƒêuraƒë became disliked by the Orthodox Serb commonfolk, so the excessively Orthodox religious Crnojeviƒás' takeover was looked upon nicely by the people, resulting in Pa≈°troviƒás' cross to Radiƒç's side. In May 1396 they moved to battle ƒêuraƒë himself, however ƒêuraƒë completely defeated the Crnojeviƒás and killed Radiƒç, managing to get a hold over a part of the Crnojeviƒá domain. Soon a new enemy arose at the west; Bosnian nobleman Sandalj Hraniƒá Kosaƒça seized large parts of land quickly and conquered Budva and Kotor, made a deal with the Pa≈°troviƒás, also managing to win Venetian protection, who proclaimed him the legitimate ruler of Budva and Zeta itself. In Upper Zeta the ƒêura≈°eviƒá subgroup of the Crnojeviƒás came to prominence, though they made an agreement and joined ƒêuraƒë, seeing a common enemy in Duke Sandalj. They aided him in the wars against Sandalj, taking the first fronts by retaking all the lands from Budva to Spiƒç as well as the Churchland of Saint Miholj in the Bay of Kotor, the Serbian Orthodox religious center in Zeta. In December 1396, the Hungarian King Sigismund lost the Battle of Nicopolis. During his return across the sea, he stayed in ƒêuraƒë's lands. To honor ƒêuraƒë for his fights against the Ottomans, Sigismund made him Prince of his Dalmatian islands of Hvar and Korƒçula. Be≈°ka island on Lake Skadar, where Bal≈°iƒá founded the monastery The Most Serene Republic of Venice led an economic policy that soon introduced Venetian monetary domination in the region, fully replacing that of the Bal≈°iƒás', and ever since Spring 1396 clearly showed pretensions to take the remaining lands of ƒêuraƒë. The Venetian monopoly introduced by lowering customs and other taxes in Scutari and Drivast greatly diminished the Bal≈°iƒás' income so the relations between the two deteriorated. It is so that in 1399 when in the Venetian-administered Bal≈°iƒá lands the oppressed peasants raised a rebellion, all the guilt was attributed to ƒêuraƒë. As a result, in early 1401 Venice ceased paying the annual thousand ducat tribute for the lands. Another reason claimed were the frequent robberies by suspects from ƒêuraƒë's domain of Venetian storehouses of salt in the region, a crucial resource in that time. This caused ƒêuraƒë to renew links with the Ottoman Turks again, but wars in Asia Minor have made them impossible to intervene, which finally forced ƒêuraƒë to succumb to Venetian demands. As per the new deal, he paid for all the damage done by the robbers and agreed to give free passage and special privileges to Venetian traders, while Venice continued to pay the tribute for the cities. These acts introduced Venetian presence in the region, which would henceforth remain as an important local political factor. In 1402 his long-term Bal≈°iƒá rival Konstantin was killed by Venetian agents in Dyrrhachium under unknown circumstances. Returning from the Battle of Angora, ƒêuraƒë's brother-in-law, the newly crowned Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá, stayed at his court in the late Summer of 1402. ƒêuraƒë prepared him and organized an army to battle his rival ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá in Ottoman service at the Battle of Tripolje near Graƒçanica in November 1402, to help his cousin with all means possible, ending in full victory. In April 1403, ƒêuraƒë II Stracimiroviƒá died of the injuries suffered in the battle. He was buried in the Church of Saint Catherine in his hometown of Ulcinj, where he still remains. Seventeen-year-old Bal≈°a, ƒêuraƒë II's only child, inherited his lands. He ruled with his mother as Chief adviser until she remarried in 1411, to Bosnian Duke Sandalj Hraniƒá from Herzegovina. She gave a significant impact to Zetan foreign policy, tying it strongly with the newly created Serbian Despotate as a former important part of the Empire.Ecclesiastic Occasions in Zeta during the Age of Nikanor Jerusalem's, Momƒçilo Spremiƒá Miscellaneous ƒêuraƒë continued using the currency of his predecessors, coins forged with the wolf, chest, and shield symbols of the Bal≈°iƒás, \\"Appearance and development of currency\\", Economic Faculty, Podgorica Dinars, used in the lands of the Serbian Empire, though he didn't mint many new coins, similar to his predecessor, due to continuous weakening of the Bal≈°iƒás' economic power. One of the two versions featured heads of wolves and the Bal≈°iƒás' coat of arms, each with a surrounding inscription: \\"M.D. GORGI STRACIMIR\\" on one side, and \\"S.STEFAN SCUTARI\\" on the other. The other version had the character \\"M\\" next to the coat of arms and the presentations of Bal≈°iƒás' patron Saint Lawrence along with an inscription below him \\"S LAVRENCIUS M\\".Perper, the Montenegrin Currency by Pavle V. Novakoviƒá According to some sources, he also issued several coins inscribed in Cyrillic ; however, later sources attribute these to ƒêuraƒë_I_Bal≈°iƒá. ƒêuraƒë founded for the Serbian Orthodox Church a Church of Saint George and the Be≈°ka Monastery on the island of Be≈°ka in Lake Skadar, near Starƒçevo. After his death, his wife Jelena expanded it in 1438/1439 with another church, the St Mary's Church, where she was buried in 1443.

He graduated B.A. in 1540‚Äì1541, and M.A. in 1544. He was returned MP for Carlisle in 1547 (Edward VI's 1st parliament)|, but he did not serve for the full duration.

Subsequently he was appointed a justice of the peace for Warwickshire, where he possessed considerable property. His residence was at Temple Balshall. In December 1569 the treasure for the supply of the army sent to suppress the Northern Rebellion was committed to his charge, and he conveyed it safely to Berwick- on-Tweed. He was returned for Warwick to the parliament of April 1571, and spoke thrice on the bill for imposing penalties on those who did not attend the services of the Established Church. The measure, he urged, ought to be only temporary in its operation. On 12 August 1572 he was elected recorder of Warwick. Queen Elizabeth I visited that town the same day on her way from Bishop's Itchington to Kenilworth Castle, and the new recorder made an oration to her majesty, which is printed in Nichols's Progresses of Queen Elizabeth. In November 1587 he resigned the recordership \\"because of his great age, and impotency to travel, and failing of sight\\".

The system, named for the khaki-coloured uniforms of the CEF, was set up by the efforts of Henry Marshall Tory and Edmund Henry Oliver and was supported by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). This university with makeshift colleges mainly in central England provided education on a range of subjects to more than 50,000 soldiers and the certificates given were accepted by Canadian universities. The term was used again for Canadian educational programs for veterans from 1945‚Äì46 after the Second World War. History Dr Henry Marshall Tory, president of Khaki University General Arthur Currie, approved Khaki University The scheme for education of Canadian army soldiers serving in Europe during the First World War evolved from classes conducted by army chaplains. They noted the need for books and courses and to provide vocational training for soldiers following demobilization. In the winter of 1917‚Äì18 chaplain Edmund Henry Oliver started what he called the \\"University of Vimy Ridge\\" in Flanders. The idea was given more support by Colonel Henry Marshall Tory with collaboration from Canadian Universities to start \\"Khaki colleges\\" in England. Oliver also worked with Colonel G.W. Birks who headed the YMCA. On December 16, 1917 Oliver met Lt.General Sir Arthur Currie who assigned Oliver as Officer in Charge of Technical and Vocational Education. Initially the scheme in France under Oliver and the scheme in England under Tory had considerable differences. Colonel Tory's plan for a more formal \\"Khaki University\\" was approved on November 8, 1918 and provided for the establishment of a Department of Educational Services in the Overseas Forces of Canada, the Khaki University of Canada. The Khaki colleges initially included a range of subjects from secondary, high school and matriculation to provide prerequisites for entry into Canadian and British universities. The scheme was backed by the Canadian general including Sir Robert Borden. The YMCA raised $500,000 and by armistice day about 14 colleges across England were in operation. Nearly 650000 soldiers attended the lectures with an enrolment of 50000 and nearly 2000 registered at the Khaki University at Ripon. Founders Padres and officers had organized educational classes and Bible study groups for enlisted men from the start of the Great War in 1914. Although Padres J.M. Almond and Clarence MacKinnon wanted the Khaki University under the control of the chaplain services, ultimately, a formal educational program was implemented among their soldiers. Gerald Birks Colonel Gerald Birks, a World War I double flying ace with the Royal Flying Corps, supervisor of the YMCA Canadian Overseas, sought to offer educational courses to keep soldiers busy in their spare time with a view to stave off the evils of gambling and / or drinking. He asked Henry Marshall Tory to write a report which recommended the formalization of educational services of Canadian forces overseas. After the War, Birks became a businessman, patron of the arts, was a painter and philanthropist. Henry Marshall Tory The programs were formalized in 1916 once Dr Henry Marshall Tory recommended in a report on discharged men from the army the establishment of an educational institution in England and France, to be called the Khaki College of Canada, with an extension department providing services for other camps in Great Britain. The educational services of Canadian forces overseas was organized and planned by Dr Henry Marshall Tory who became president of the Khaki College in 1917, while he was on leave as president of the University of Alberta. After the War, Tory returned as President of the University of Alberta, then founded colleges which became Carleton University and the University of British Columbia. Arthur Currie General Arthur Currie approved Khaki University as a component of the training for all soldiers in all divisions on 18 December 1917. After the War, Currie became the President and Vice Chancellor of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. Under the general staff of the Canadian Army, the Khaki College became the educational services of Canadian Forces overseas in 1918. The program, which grew from the chaplain services of the Canadian Army and study groups of the Canadian of the YMCA, was a forerunner of similar programs in the military forces of other countries. Mission The goals were to provide morale during the war and for demobilized personnel, and to provide personnel an opportunity to continue their education in postwar preparation. Initially, the university-educated chaplains and officers acted as instructors, spiritual counsellors and guardians of morality. Once the Khaki University was formally recognized by the government, universities began to send professors to Europe to help the skeleton force of teachers from military headquarters teach. Khaki University credits were recognized as equivalent to those of Canadian institutions. France Major-General L.J. Lipsett organized the first educational courses. Captain Edmund H. Oliver became head of the University of Vimy Ridge (UVR), a component of the Khaki University. Oliver was a Chaplain in the 4th Divisional Wing and former Principal of the Presbyterian Theological College in Saskatoon, set up a course of instruction for soldiers in the 3rd Infantry Division, then fighting on the Western Front. Captain Edmund H. Oliver wrote \\"It was felt by the GOC, 3rd Division, that the long evenings of winter during the period when the men were in rest or in reserve could be utilized not only to relieve the monotony of the daily routine, but as well, in some measure, to equip men for greater efficiency in business, the professions, agriculture and the other great industries of the Dominion.\\" The name was suggested by his executive assistant, Rev. Cpt. William Gilmour (1880‚Äì1938), after the great victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge a few months earlier: Programs A Khaki University certificate In 1917, 19 education centres were organized in the camps and hospitals in England and in France. About 50 000 soldiers taking courses part-time in agriculture, business education, mechanics, teacher training, legal studies and medical instruction. Designed to be inclusive, courses spanned commercial subjects; practical science; agriculture; literacy, languages; matriculation work, undergraduate university courses; and subjects like singing, elocution and cooking. In addition, practical trades like carpentry were offered. Khaki university taught illiterate men to read and write all the way to the instruction of 1,000 Canadian soldiers enrolled in university-level students. The training was delivered via lectures, small study and reading groups, classes and directed readings and practical hands-on training. Libraries were established and textbooks were approved by all Canadian provinces. In England, there were 11 Khaki Colleges by May 1918, with 400 Canadians taking courses at London University. In some cases, noted scholars and public figures such as Bernard Shaw lectured at the camp educational classes. During this period, one of the commanding officers was Canadian historian W. Stewart Wallace. Post-War In 1939, the Canadian Legion Educational Services were established for Canadian Armed Forces at home and abroad. Legislation In 1939, the War Emergency Training Program was established. In 1942, the Canadian federal government established the Federal Vocational Training Coordination Act. In 1944, the Canadian federal government established the Veterans' Rehabilitation Act. The Federal Apprenticeship Training Agreement (1944) was established followed by The Federal Vocational Schools Assistance Agreement (1945). In 1951, the War Emergency Training Program was re-established due to the Korean War. Second World War During the Second World War, Brigadier Ted G. E. Beament, OBE, ED, (RMC 1925) was appointed Officer Commanding the Khaki University (principal). An extension department provided services for other camps in Great Britain and France. Brigadier Ted G.E. Beament was awarded the Governor General's Gold Medal upon his graduation from the Royal Military College of Canada # 1828 in 1929.

Throughout his time on the show, the character mostly contributed to his family's story arc since their first arrival on 26 January 1998. This involves Gianni developing a close interaction with his older brother Beppe (Michael Greco); managing their late father's restaurant in light of his funeral; becoming enemies with Beppe's sworn nemesis Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); briefly dating local businesswoman Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha); a broken relationship with fellow resident Jackie Owen (Race Davies) after she leaves the square with her criminal brother Steve (Martin Kemp); sparking clashes with Grant's brother Phil (Steve McFadden) and his best-friend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass); and nearly being charged in police custody for attacking his sister's maths tutor, Rod Morris (Forbes Masson), under the guise that he assaulted them. Eventually, Gianni departed the programme along with the majority of his family on 3 August 2000. Storylines Gianni Di Marco first arrived in Albert Square - the local community in Walford, a fictionalized borough in East London - along with the rest of his family in January 1998. He is the younger of the two brothers in the family, the other being Beppe (Michael Greco). They have two younger sisters, Teresa (Leila Birch) and Nicky (Carly Hillman). Gianni works as a chef in the family restaurant, Giuseppe's, named after his late father. He later becomes the manager of the restaurant. During his time on the square, Gianni sparks relationships that all end in disaster. This begins with him dating local businesswoman Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha), which is stopped when there are doubts over whether Gianni's real father is actually Annie's father George (Paul Moriarty). DNA tests prove Gianni really is a di Marco, but his relationship with Annie doesn't continue. He then has a relationship with fellow resident Jackie Owen (Race Davies), but discovers that she suffers from severe PMT, and this makes their relationship more and more difficult when Gianni has to put up with Jackie's violent temper and foul moods. Eventually, Jackie leaves Walford with her criminal brother Steve (Martin Kemp) and her relationship with Gianni is over. Gianni later began a brief affair with one of his neighbors, Louise Raymond (Carol Harrison), but it isn't anything more than a casual fling. By then, Gianni has found himself drawn in an ongoing feud between Beppe and his sworn enemy Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp. This continues when Grant's brother Phil (Steve McFadden) gets involved in the conflict, whereupon the two groups of brothers appear to have a rivalry over several interests. At one point in The Queen Victoria public house, Gianni grows irritated when he finds Teresa romancing with Phil's best-friend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) - not long after he was revealed to have cheated on his girlfriend Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) with her daughter Bianca (Patsy Palmer); the mother-and-duo consequently left the square on their own alongside Bianca's beloved husband Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). When Gianni confronts Dan to warn him in staying away from Teresa over threatening circumstances, Dan rebuffs him until Gianni throws a drink at him. The pair nearly brawl until Gianni is forced to leave the pub. Later on, Gianni attacks Nicky's maths teacher Rod Morris (Forbes Masson) after she claims that he assaulted her. Rod presses charges of assault but later drops them. Gianni and the rest of his family leave Walford in August 2000 to start a new life in Leicester, living with their uncle Franco - leaving Beppe and his son Joe (Jake Kyprianou) in Walford. Character creation and development The Italian di Marco family were introduced early in 1998 by Series Producer Jane Harris. The di Marcos were a family of eight, consisting of grandparents Bruno and Luisa (Leon Lissek and Stella Tanner), their daughter-in-law Rosa (Louise Jameson), her children Beppe, Gianni, Teresa and Nicky, and Beppe's young son Joe. They were heralded as the \\"family that would rival the Mitchells\\", one of the most successful and long-running families to have been featured in EastEnders. According to author Rupert Smith, the di Marcos \\"landed with an almighty thud in January [1998], turning out in force for the funeral of patriarch Giuseppe\\", who was Rosa's husband and an old business associate of the character George Palmer. The following month, the family moved to the area in which the soap is set, Walford, to run an Italian restaurant, which was named Giuseppe's. The di Marcos remained with the show as a unit until 2000, when the new executive producer, John Yorke, decided to cull the majority of the family. All except Beppe and his son Joe were written out. They were reportedly \\"slaughtered because of a shortage of ideas for what to do with them\\". A source allegedly told The Mirror: \\"It's always unpleasant having to say goodbye to people who have given loyal service to the show for a number of years. But John Yorke feels it's time to make his mark on the show. Every new producer likes to do the same. John wants to introduce a new family later this year and felt the Di Marcos had nowhere else to go. Their storylines were beginning to feel tired and that's a good time to make such a drastic change.\\" However an official BBC spokesperson at the time commented: \\"These changes [‚Ä¶] are just part of [John Yorke's] plans to revamp the series and give it a new look.\\" The cuts paved the way for the arrival of the popular Slater family. Beppe and Joe remained until 2002, when they were axed too. Reception The di Marcos are now deemed as something of a failure for EastEnders. Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes :\\"Nobody really knew what to do with the di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, there was nothing else for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them‚Ä¶it was as if they'd never been\\". Matthew Baylis of The Guardian has commented on their lack of success: \\"Thank heaven for off-screen uncles. As we saw during the hurried departure of the di Marco family from Albert Square, there's nothing like a fictitious relative when you need to get characters off the screen‚Ä¶The di Marcos' departure had its dodgy elements. A hitherto unheard-of uncle needs help in his restaurant, so the whole family ups sticks. Including Teresa - who'd always fought for independence from her family? Rosa, who presumably owned the house she'd transformed into something resembling an Imperial Palace, is suddenly prepared to leg it with a couple of suitcases? There was plenty that didn't ring true. But few viewers minded. There was, if anything, more sympathy for the programme-makers, trying valiantly to dispose of this singularly unpopular family while retaining an element of drama.\\" The di Marcos have been dismissed as \\"unconvincing characters\\". Baylis goes on to highlight a problem that he feels \\"dogged the whole family\\", their occupation as restaurateurs. Baylis believes this kept them \\"self-contained\\", and prevented them from establishing meaningful links with other characters. He explains: \\"[The di Marcos] had an ambiguity, heightened by the job they did. Soapland has no place for grey areas. Bad things happen to bad people. They also happen to good people, of course, but not for very long. To make this predictable universe work on the screen, you need characters who are relatively stable (even if they are unstable). The writers and the viewers buy into a myth that people aren't particularly complex, that the full range of their feelings and actions can be revealed in a few hours on the TV. And a quick, visible way of revealing characters is to mirror them in their occupation. Thus we have Pauline Fowler, long-suffering drudge and matriarch. What better job than folding pants all day in the launderette? Or Peggy [Mitchell] - tough but fun-loving and gregarious. So she runs the pub. But what attributes spring to mind when we think of Italian restaurants? Fond of pasta, perhaps? Permanently overworked? The job never provided an easy route into understanding the di Marcos' characters‚Ä¶The most visible jobs tend to be taken by the strongest, most vivid characters. Confined to their restaurant, the di Marcos could only become involved in Walford life when other characters came over to eat a carbonara. And how often do working-class East End people do that? If any di Marco wanted a night out, a pint in the Vic, a clandestine liaison, then an excuse had to be found as to why they weren't working. Transforming Giuseppe's into a daytime sandwich bar, and sending Teresa onto the market were bold rescue attempts, but they came too late. The viewers had already decided they didn't much care‚Ä¶Because of their jobs, the di Marcos became a largely self-contained unit‚Ä¶\\" References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional chefs Category:Television characters introduced in 1998 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Gianni di Marco"},{"id":"4523682","text":"2019 arson An animation studio is a company producing animated media. The broadest such companies conceive of products to produce, own the physical equipment for production, employ operators for that equipment, and hold a major stake in the sales or rentals of the media produced. They also own rights over merchandising and creative rights for characters created/held by the company, much like authors holding copyrights. In some early cases, they also held patent rights over methods of animation used in certain studios that were used for boosting productivity. Overall, they are business concerns and can function as such in legal terms. American studios Raoul Barr√©Winsor McCay was widely renowned as the father of the animated cartoon, having converted his cartoon strip Little Nemo into a 10-minute feature film, co- directing it along with J. Stuart Blackton, released on April 8, 1911. However, the idea of a studio dedicated to animating cartoons was spearheaded by Raoul Barr√© and his studio, Barr√© Studio, co-founded with Bill Nolan, beating out the studio created by J.R. Bray, Bray Productions, to the honor of the first studio dedicated to animation. Though beaten to the post of being the first studio, Bray's studio employee, Earl Hurd, came up with patents designed for mass-producing the output for the studio. As Hurd did not file for these patents under his own name but handed them to Bray, they would go on to form the Bray-Hurd Patent Company and sold these techniques for royalties to other animation studios of the time. The patents for animation systems using drawings on transparent celluloid sheets and a registration system that kept images steady were held under this firm. Bray also developed the basic division of labor still used in animation studios (animators, assistants, layout artists, etc.). Walt Disney The biggest name in animation studios during this early time was Disney Brothers Animation Studio (now known as Walt Disney Animation Studios), co-founded by Walt and Roy O. Disney. Started on October 16, 1923, the studio went on to make its first animated short, Steamboat Willie in 1928, to much critical success, though the real breakthrough was in 1937, when the studio was able to produce a full-length animated feature film i.e. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which laid the foundation for other studios to try to make full-length movies. In 1932 Flowers and Trees, a production by Walt Disney Productions and United Artists, won the first Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. This period, from the 1920s to the 1950s or sometimes considered from 1911 to the death of Walt Disney in 1966, is commonly known as the Golden Age of American Animation as it included the growth of Disney, as well as the rise of Warner Bros. Cartoons and the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio as prominent animation studios. Disney continued to lead in technical prowess among studios for a long time afterwards, as can be seen with their achievements. In 1941, Otto Messmer created the first animated television commercials for Botany Tie ads/weather reports. They were shown on NBC-TV in New York until 1949. This marked the first forays of animation designed for the smaller screen and was to be followed by the first animated series specifically made for television, Crusader Rabbit, in 1948. Its creator, Alex Anderson, had to create the studio 'Television Arts Productions' specifically for the purpose of creating this series as his old studio, Terrytoons, refused to make a series for television. Since Crusader Rabbit, however, many studios have seen this as a profitable enterprise and many have entered the made for television market since, with Bill Hanna refining the production process for television animation on his show Ruff and Reddy. It was in 1958 that The Huckleberry Hound Show claimed the title of being the first all-new half-hour cartoon show. This, along with their previous success with the series Tom and Jerry, elevated Hanna's animation studio, Hanna-Barbera Productions, to dominate the North American television animation market during the latter half of the 20th Century. In 2002, Shrek, produced by DreamWorks and Pacific Data Images won the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Since then, Disney/Pixar have produced the most number of movies either to win or be nominated for the award. Direct-to-video market Direct-to-video animation has seen a rise, as a concept, in the Western markets. With many comic characters receiving their versions of OVA's, original video animations, under the Westernized title of direct-to-video animations, the OVA market has spread to American animation houses. Though the term \\"direct-to-video\\" carries negative connotations in the North American and European markets, their popularity has resulted in comic characters ranging from Hellboy, Green Lantern and Avengers, to television shows such as Family Guy and Futurama, all releasing direct-to- video animations. DC Comics have continually released their own animated movies for the sole purpose of sale in the direct-to-video market. With growing worries about piracy, direct to video animation might become more popular in the near future. Ownership trends With the growth of animation as an industry, the trends of ownership of studios have gradually changed with time. Current studios such as Warner Bros. and early ones such as Fleischer Studios, started life as small, independent studios, being run by a very small core group. After being bought out or sold to other companies, they eventually consolidated with other studios and became larger. The drawback of this setup was that there was now a major thrust towards profitability with the management acting as a damper towards creativity of these studios, continuing even in today's scenario. Currently, the independent animation studios are looking to ensure artistic integrity by signing up with big animation studios on contracts that allow them to license out movies, without being directed by the bigger studios. Examples of such co-operation are the joint ventures between DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures and that of Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Studios. Japanese studios Hayao Miyazaki The first known example of Japanese animation, also called anime, is dated around 1917, but it would take until 1956 for the Japanese animation industry to successfully adopt the studio format as used in the United States. In 1961, these productions began to be aired in the USA. Toei Animation, formed in 1948, was the first Japanese animation studio of importance and saw the reduction of animators as independent anime artists. After the formation of Toei Animation Co. Ltd. in 1948, the Japanese studios churned out minor works of animation. But with the release of Toei's first theatrical feature, The Tale of the White Serpent released in October 1958, the animation industry in Japan came into the eye of the general public. The success of Alakazam the Great led to the finding of the artist Osamu Tezuka, who would go on to become the father of Japanese manga with his brand of modern, fast-paced fantasy storylines. He became influenced by Hanna-Barbera productions of the late 1950s and made Japan's first made for television animation studio, Mushi Productions. The success of the studios' first show in 1963, Astro Boy, was so immense that there were 3 other television animation studios by the end of the year and Toei had opened their own made for television division. The greatest difference between Japanese studios and North American studios was the difference in adult-themed material to make way in Japan. Tezuka's thought that animation should not be restricted to kids alone has brought about many studios that are employed in the production of adult-themed adaptations of classic stories such as Heidi (Heidi, Girl of the Alps), One Thousand and One Nights and The Diary of a Young Girl and many more. In the 1980s, animation studios were led back to their theatrical roots due to the success of Hayao Miyazaki's film Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind, which led publishing house Tokuma Shoten to finance a new animation studio, Studio Ghibli, which would be used for the personal works of Miyazaki and his close friend, Isao Takahata. Many of Ghibli's works have become Japan's top-grossing theatrical films, whether in live-action or animated form. OAV/OVA market The market for 'OAV's or 'Original Anime Video' later the acronym would be better known as 'OVA' meaning 'Original video animation' as the term 'OAV' could often be misunderstood for 'Original Adult Video', began in 1984. These are often tended towards the home video market, while not tending to the television or theatrical audience as such. They refer to those movies that are launched as direct-to-video releases and not meant to be released in theatres. Video productions can run from half an hour productions to well over two hours. They require that premise or story be original in order to be counted as an OVA, though sometimes, the story can be derived from a longer running manga or animated series. As the OAV market is not adapted to the rigors that are faced by television shows or feature films, they have been known to show gratuitous amounts of violence and/or pornography. Some OAV's have registered such strong acclaim that they have been remade as anime television series as well as theatrical releases. Since most new OVA's are derived from other animated media, many animation studios that have previously worked on animated series or movies, and adaptations of Japanese manga, have now entered the OVA market, looking to capitalize on the popularity of their flagship shows. Studios participating in such circumstances include Production I.G and Studio Deen. Animator's contracts Although there are permanent/full-time positions in studios, most animators work on a contract basis. There are some animators that are considered to be in the core group of the studio, which can either be as a result of being there since the inception of the company or being talented recruits from other animation studios. These are the more secure positions in an animation studio, though the studio might have policies concerning the possible tenure of animators. Since studios can hire animators on a work for hire basis nowadays, many artists do not retain rights over their creations, unlike some of the early animators. The extent of these copyrights is subject to local intellectual property rights. The animators must also be aware of the contracts laws and labour laws prevalent in the jurisdiction to which the animation studio is subject to. There have been numerous legal battles fought over the copyright of famous franchises, such as Kung Fu Panda and SpongeBob SquarePants. This has come about as a result of the clause in Copyright contracts that states that an idea cannot be protected, only an actual piece of work can be said to be infringed upon. This means that though the animators may have forwarded ideas to the animation studios about certain characters and plots, these ideas alone cannot be protected and can lead to studios profiting on individual animator's ideas. However, this has not stopped many independent artists from filing claims to characters produced by different studios. Animation specialties An example of traditional animation: a horse animated by rotoscoping from Eadweard Muybridge's 19th-century photos Due to the wide range of animation techniques and styles, many animation studios typically specialize in certain types.  Traditional animation  Traditional animation employs the use of hand drawn frames that are. Traditional animation studios have seen a decline in recent years due to the increased use of computers and some companies, such as Walt Disney Animation Studios, have transitioned away from traditional animation to computer-generated imagery. Nonetheless, traditional animation still is used extensively in the world of cartoons and anime. Notable studios that specialize in this style include Studio Ghibli and Cartoon Network Studios.  Stop-motion animation  Stop-motion animation uses objects that are incrementally moved and photographed in order to create an illusion of movement when the resulting frames are played back. Notable studios specializing in this style of animation include Aardman Animations and Laika.  3D computer animation  3D animation is the newest of the animation techniques, using the assistance of computers and software, such as Houdini, to create 3D models that are then manipulated and rendered to create movement. Notable studios include Pixar Animation Studios , Blue Sky Studios and Illumination.

It was built by U.S. Army troops under the command of Lt. John Mullan, between the spring of 1859 and summer 1860. It led from Fort Benton, which at the time was in the Dakota Territory, then Idaho Territory from July 1863, and Montana Territory beginning in May 1864, and the navigational head of the Missouri River (and once farthest inland port in the world). The road connected to Fort Walla Walla, Washington Territory, near the Columbia River. The road previewed the route approximately followed of modern- day Interstate 15 and Interstate 90 through present-day Montana, Idaho, and Washington. Parts of the Mullan Road can still be traveled; one such section is near Washtucna, Washington. A segment of the Mullan Road in the vicinity of Benton Lake was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and the American Society of Civil Engineers designated it a historic civil engineering landmark in 1977. Three segments of the road in Idaho were also listed on the National Register in 1990. In 2009, the Point of Rocks segment in Montana was also listed on the National Register as part of the Point of Rocks Historic Transportation Corridor. History Mullan Pass near Helena, Montana As early as 1852 the US government began to think about building an overland route to the Pacific Ocean to help settle the area with pioneers and eliminate any claims that France, England or Russia had on the disputed territories. Despite the Lewis and Clark expedition, little detail was known about the country. Isaac Ingalls Stevens, a West Point graduate appointed the first governor of the Washington Territory, was ordered to survey a route from the Missouri River to the Columbia River suitable for building a railroad. Stevens assumed the task, but also kept in mind that the route should be suitable for a wagon road. In the spring of 1853, Congress authorized a U.S. Army expedition, led by Stevens. It was made up of engineers and explorers; they organized near St. Paul, Minnesota. They were to detail the geographical and topographical character of the country. Among them was a small, dark- haired young man, Lieutenant John Mullan; just a year out of West Point, he was anxious to prove his mettle as an engineer. Mullan was placed in charge of surveying, and later improving, a wagon route (now commonly called the Mullan Road) between Fort Benton (Montana) and Fort Walla Walla (Washington). Lieutenant Mullan, a topographical engineer, began gathering information in 1854. Delayed by the Yakima War which ended in 1858, construction began in 1859 from Fort Walla Walla in what was then Washington Territory. Lieutenant Mullan commanded a workforce of more than 200, including civilian workers, surveyors, engineers, and soldiers who carved a road across the region. HistoryLink.org Essay 5225 After the difficult project was completed in 1860, floods wiped out substantial stretches of the road. It was re-routed in 1861. Floods again damaged the road, and ultimately, no provision for maintenance was provided. Although the road was never heavily used by the military, it was an important conduit for civilian passage, which hastened settling of the northwestern United States. In the first year after completion, it was used by an estimated 20,000 people, 6,000 horses and mules, 5,000 cattle and 83 wagons. The discovery of gold in North Central Idaho in 1860 by Capt. E.D. Pierce contributed to this usage, making Lewiston, Washington Territory, the largest town in the Pacific Northwest and the capital of the new Idaho Territory beginning July 4, 1863. The Mullan Road helped Walla Walla become the largest town in Washington Territory by 1870, with a population of 1,394. The road continued to serve as an important route until the completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1883 provided faster and more convenient access to the region. Route of the Mullan Road From the origin at Fort Benton, Montana, the Mullan Road proceeded: * West from Fort Benton, it passed north of Great Falls * Dropping south to cross the continental divide west of Helena (following a path through Mullan Pass at , immediately north of that now traveled by US 12) * Just west of Garrison, it joined the route used by the future US 10 (present-day Interstate 90) (similar to the US 12 transition to join Interstate 90 today) * Along the Clark Fork River near the ghost town of Bearmouth, also along the future US 10 * It remained with the future US 10 route as it passed through Missoula, proceeding west through Montana. The Mullan Road through the Missoula Valley, slightly south of the former US 10 and still in use today as S-263, fostered rapid growth for the burgeoning city, and allowed the U.S. Army to establish Fort Missoula in 1877. One stretch from St. Regis to Henderson north of today's Interstate 90 is still in use as Old Mullan Road and Mullan Gulch Road. * From the Taft area, it crossed the Bitterroot Range into Idaho over St. Regis Pass (named Sohon Pass by John Mullan) () at , about west-southwest of Lookout Pass, where I-90 crosses the state line. * From the middle of the Idaho crossing, the road deviates from present-day major roads. The Mullan Road went southwesterly in Idaho to pass south of Lake Coeur d'Alene * The road then passed into Washington some distance south of Spokane * From there, the Mullan Road passed through the Palouse country and then the scablands of eastern Washington. * It passed through Benge, that section of the road was completed May 22, 1861; the wagon ruts were still visible in 2008, just northeast of town at the site of the First Benge School. * South of Benge, there is a stretch of the former road still labeled 'Mullan Road.' This gravel section travels southwesterly until it meets State Route 26 near Washtucna. * The portion of Mullan Road south of SR 26 in Washington, which follows the course of the Palouse River as it descends to the Snake River, has been reverted to grazing and is not accessible to the public. * After crossing the Snake River near the confluence with the Palouse River, the Mullan Road continues south along the Fort Walla Walla Fort Colville Military Road http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=7992 to its terminus at Fort Walla Walla near Walla Walla.

Joint Publishing (Hong Kong) is one of major book store chains in Hong Kong and currently a subsidiary company of Sino United Publishing (Holdings) Limited. The Mainland China branches of the book store chain, such as SDX Joint Publishing and Shanghai Joint Publishing were owned by separate holding company of the Chinese government. Joint Publishing (Hong Kong)'s parent company Sino United Publishing, was owned by Chinese central government agency Hong Kong Liaison Office. History The book store was the result of a merger in 1948 between three leading Shanghai publishers and book stores, Life (), Reading () and New Knowledge (). The newly merged bookstore brought together all the names of its previous entities (), but was often referred to in English as SDX Joint Publishing, taking the first initial of each of the previous names to form an acronym, or simply Sanlian Press or Joint Publishing (). Shortly after it was formed, it moved its headquarters to Beijing in March 1949 and established its Hong Kong-based subsidiary. After the establishment of People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, the bookstore located in Hong Kong was mainly responsible for publishing materials from mainland China, while the main branch in mainland China was nationalized. After the coming of Cultural Revolution in mainland China in 1966, the publishing business in mainland China was seriously damaged and the bookstore in Hong Kong survived by republishing old books. With several re-locations, it finally settled in current premises in Queen Victoria Street in May 1971 and opened a retail store at the ground floor in July 1974. The Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 and was soon replaced with economic reform. In 1978 the book store in Hong Kong decided to publish their own books independently and join with other international publishers. It initially targeted in Chinese culture, literature and art and later concentrated Hong Kong topics and social science. Its direction was proved successful and the book store aggressively opened branches in Hong Kong. Outside Hong Kong, the book store expanded to various cities in mainland China by joint venture, and five stores in North America, specifically in Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

The park consists primarily of water-based attractions and opened in 1998. Its predecessor, Action Park, one of the first modern American water parks, was open from 1978 until 1996 and became infamous for its consequently poor safety record. At least six people are known to have died as a result of mishaps on rides at the original park. Despite this, the park was very popular and attracted thrill- seekers from across the New York metropolitan area. On February 9, 1998, Intrawest announced the purchase of the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, including the Action Park property.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Intrawest+Adds+Ninth+Resort+to+Network-a020216861 - Press release announcing Intrawest's purchase of Vernon Valley - Great Gorge's ski resort, Action Park, and GAR owned real estate After a massive overhaul, which included revamping rides and removing attractions deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision,https://web.archive.org/web/19980425131249/http://www.actionpark.com/3-98.html - Internet archive copy of a press release on Mountain Creek's website announcing the waterpark's planned opening on June 15, 1998 the water park was reopened as Mountain Creek Waterpark. In 2010, the Mountain Creek ski area and waterpark was sold to a group led by Eugene Mulvihill, the former owner of Vernon Valley/Great Gorge and the owner of the adjacent Crystal Springs Resort. It was under the new ownership that the name of the water park was changed back to Action Park in 2014. Two years later, the name was reverted to Mountain Creek Waterpark. History Action Park (1978‚Äì1996) Chair lift to the top of the alpine slide, Action Park, August 1994. The idea for the park began in 1976 when Eugene Mulvihill and his company, Great American Recreation, the owners of the recently combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer, so they opened a alpine slide down one of the steep ski trails. For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two water slides and a go-kart track, and named the collection of rides the Vernon Valley Summer Park. Additional attractions would be built by 1980, and the park would evolve to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides). The park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends. However, Action Park became infamous for poorly designed, unsafe rides; under-aged, under-trained, and often under-the-influence staff;Austin, Joanne; \\"Revisiting Traction ... Er, Action, Park,\\" Weird NJ, October 2005, pages 20‚Äì24 intoxicated, unprepared visitors; and a consequently poor safety record. At least six people are known to have died as a result of mishaps on rides at the original park, and as such, it was given nicknames such as \\"Traction Park\\", \\"Accident Park\\", and \\"Class Action Park\\".Jersey Ed; May 2006; \\"We Called it Accident Park\\" in \\"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\\"; Weird NJ, 28. In September 1989, GAR unsuccessfully negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation that would result in the sale of Vernon Valley/Great Gorge, and Action Park, for $50 million. A few rides were closed and dismantled due to costly settlements and rising insurance premiums in the 1990s, and the park's attendance began to suffer as a recession early in that decade reduced the number of visitors. In early 1995, GAR operated Vernon Valley/Great Gorge and Action Park with no liability insurance, instead relying on self-insurance. However, they ultimately purchased liability insurance. As 1995 progressed, GAR's financial woes continued to accumulate, and foreclosure suits started being filed against the corporation. Law firms also sued for compensation for services rendered between 1991 and 1993. GAR negotiated a deal to temporary fend off an impending foreclosure, but in February 1996, the creditors who had taken on GAR's debt petitioned to force GAR into bankruptcy over the $14 million owed by the struggling company. GAR filed for Chapter 11 protection that following March but remained optimistic that they could regain their financial footing \\"within a year.\\" Action Park closed at the end of the season as usual on Labor Day, September 2, 1996. Despite expecting to reopen the next year, on June 25, 1997, GAR announced the cessation of all its operations, including Action Park. Intrawest era (1998‚Äì2010) Following the demise of GAR in 1997, Praedium Recovery Fund purchased the Vernon Valley-Great Gorge resort, and Action Park, for $10 million.\\"Court accepts bid for ski area\\" - The Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - September 12, 1997 The investment group put the company Angel Projects in charge of managing the resort, and aimed to pump in some $20 million to upgrade the ski resort's equipment, trails, and to remodel the water park.\\"New owner to reopen Vernon Valley slopes\\" - The Star- Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - October 18, 1997 Canadian park operator Intrawest purchased the park and neighboring Vernon Valley ski area in February 1998.

The owners, aware of the image problems created during the Action Park era, sought to differentiate themselves from their predecessors.\\"New name breeds hope for a new image Operators of Mountain Creek look to shed sour reputation that came with Action Park\\" - The Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ) - June 19, 1998 By this time, Mountain Creek was no longer the state's largest water park, nor was it the draw that it was during its original heyday, as other water parks built around the region have since divided the market. Since Intrawest was a ski resort corporation, the water park would be leased out to Palace Entertainment after the first couple of years. As a result of problems at the original Action Park, New Jersey toughened its amusement regulations. During the Mountain Creek era, many of the rides built during the heyday of Action Park boasted large bilingual signs advising patrons of just what the ride entails, how deep the water is in metric and US customary units, the age it is most appropriate for, and the state regulatory ID numbers. Safety rules are strictly enforced at the new park, although alcohol is still available. Sale, Action Park revival, and Mountain Creek return (2010‚Äìpresent) In 2010, Intrawest, which ended up in bankruptcy proceedings itself as a result of a leveraged buyout, sold both the Mountain Creek ski resort and the water park to the owners of Crystal Springs Resort. The water park would remain under lease to Palace Entertainment until 2011, when the owners of the resort bought out the operating lease to the water park.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOqERQhWXnc - \\"Action PArk: The World's Raddest Water Park This returned control of the former Action Park property, as well as the entire former Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, to the Mulvihill family, as they had retained ownership of the ski area that was renamed Crystal Springs following GAR's bankruptcy. In April 2014, the Mulvihill family changed the name of Mountain Creek back to Action Park. However, on May 29, 2016, it was announced that the Action Park name was again retired and that the park would revert to the Mountain Creek Waterpark name.  Future development  In the summer of 2014, the Zero-G opened. Located on the tower for H2 OhNo, the Zero-G is a double-looping slide featuring two inclined loops. In 2015, plans for new park attractions were announced. These included a new lounge area and pools, relocation of batting cages to near the Action Putts Miniature Golf Course, and the construction of a temporary go- kart track by the same miniature golf course.http://www.vernontwp.com/government/land_use_board/minutes_april_23_2014/ - Vernon, NJ, Land use Board Meeting, April 23, 2014. A ride called the Sky Caliber, a vertically looping water slide, was also under development. Unlike the original Cannonball Loop, riders were to ride in bullet-shaped aluminum cages, and the slide would feature a taller and steeper approach, as well as a teardrop-shaped loop.https://www.latimes.com/travel/themeparks/la-trb-action- park-looping-water-slide-20150305-story.html - \\"Vertical looping water slide, long thought impossible, in test phase\\" The world's longest water slide, a inflatable slide made in Waimauku, New Zealand, back in 2013, was to be moved to Mountain Creek and installed there.

He was the first player to be consistently used as a relief pitcher. Consequently, he was given the nickname Doc by Damon Runyon who said Crandall was \\"the physician of the pitching emergency\\".McNeil, William The evolution of pitching in major league baseball McFarland 2006, p. 53 citing Thorn's Relief Pitcher. He played from 1908 to 1918, debuting with the New York Giants. He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1913, but made only two pinch-hitting appearances for them before being sold back to the Giants 13 days later. He also played for the St. Louis Terriers in the Federal League in 1914 and 1915, the St. Louis Browns in 1916, and for the Boston Braves in 1918. That same year he flirted with a no-hitter in the morning game of a double-header in Los Angeles against Salt Lake City of the Pacific Coast League. He carried the no-hitter into the 9th inning when, with two out, his outing was spoiled by Karl Crandall, his brother.R.J. Lesch, \\"Doc Crandall,\\" SABR Baseball Biography Project, https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/93ccb646, accessed May 10, 2020 While Crandall frequently started, he led the league in number of relief appearances for five consecutive seasons while with the Giants. In the period from 1910 to 1912, he also led in relief victories going 45‚Äì16 overall in that time period. The Giants won three consecutive pennants from 1911 to 1913 with Crandall's help. Even with his bulky frame, Crandall was a quick fielder and thus played infield positions. With his .285 lifetime hitting average, he was often used as a pinch hitter and in 1910 he led with a .342 batting average. When the Giants sent him to the Cardinals in 1913 public outcry in New York was so big that the Giants bought him back after only two games. However, he ended up in St. Louis again a year later in the Federal league where he played more at second base than as pitcher. In 1915 he led the Federal League winning six times as relief pitcher out of his total 21 wins in that league. After sitting out the 1917 season, he made an abbreviated comeback in 1918 with the Braves. Crandall is a charter member of the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame.

The Status Civilization is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert Sheckley, first published in 1960. The Status Civilization concerns Will Barrent, a man who finds himself, without memory of any crime or, indeed, of his previous life, being shipped across space to the planet Omega. Omega, used to imprison extreme offenders, has a hierarchical society of extreme brutality, where the only way to advance (and avoid dying) is to commit an endless series of crimes. The average life expectancy from time of arrival on Omega is three years. The story concerns Barrent's attempt to survive, escape, and return to Earth to clear himself of the accusations against him. Plot summary Earth is a uniform, weakly structured, utopian society based on the mutual trust and conformity of its citizens. It is sleepy and stagnant, developing neither socially nor technologically. Its striking social stability is maintained by robots brainwashing children in \\"closed classes.\\" The ideologies of both Earth and Omega resemble one another, differing only in words. On Omega, the citizens worship Evil (always capitalized) in a cult dedicated to an entity called The Black One. On Earth, the world religion is an amalgam of all the \\"good\\" aspects of previous Earth religions. Its institution is the Church of the Spirit of Mankind Incarnate. As Barrent comes closer to the truth about the reasons for his incarceration, his Omegan consciousness conflicts with his subconsciousness which was programmed in the closed classes by the robots when he was a child. The subsequent psychological struggle is played out by repeating all of the previous fights and battles which Barrent experienced throughout the book, eventually making clear the vision (or \\"skrenning\\") which the mutant girl on Omega foresaw of Barrent's death.

Buildings forming a quadrangle were subsequently erected to the rear of the main building and the chapel. An increase in the number of pupils through the twentieth century, attributable in part to the admittance of girls, necessitated the construction of, among other buildings, three boarding houses. Kent College school hall, now the chapel. Buildings Chocolate and chat: The Main Building, which accommodates School House, and the School Room, which was converted for use as a chapel in 1936, were constructed in two stages in 1887 and 1900. The stained-glass windows in the chapel depict things incorporated in the school's badge. In 1938 a fire, which broke out when the master on duty was at the cinema in Canterbury, caused substantial damage to the Main Building; the central spire collapsed and was not replaced during reconstruction. Prickett Building: Named after John Prickett, a former headmaster. The building was used for the Kent College Junior School. It is recorded in the \\"Kent College Centenary Book\\" that during the construction of the Prickett Building, difficulties arose because of the presence of an underground spring. Kent College, July 1888 Science Block: The Science Block was constructed in 1958 by the school, financed by parents, friends and Old Canterburians in addition to a contribution from the Industrial Fund, and was opened by Professor Charles Coulson. \\"Glasshouse\\" classrooms: The \\"Glasshouse classrooms\\", at the north side of the Quad., were opened by James Chuter-Ede, Baron Chuter-Ede of Epsom (Home Secretary in Clement Attlee's Labour Government), and were recently refurbished to accommodate the Sixth Form Centre on the first floor. Kent College, May 2012 Centenary Building: The foundation stone of the Centenary Building was laid by John Prickett. The building contained the school Library until the Library was relocated in 2005 to the first floor of the Main Building; the Music Department occupies the Centenary Building today. Wesley House: Named to recall the ethos of Kent College, the boarding house for girls was opened by David and Olive Norfolk in 1978. Norfolk Building: Named after David Norfolk, a former headmaster, who opened the building (constructed on the site of the open-air swimming pool). Guilford House: Named for the Earl of Guilford; the Countess of Guilford opened the boys' boarding house on Speech Day in 1964. Moat House (No longer in Kent College's possession): Moat House was acquired as part of the Moat Estate (the acquisition of which came about through the donations of Old Canterburians in the face of a refusal by the Board of Management in the 1940s to finance it). Before Kent College acquired the house it had been rented for convalescence by Virginia Woolf , who complained in one of her letters that \\"we had our windows prized open. The decay of centuries had sealed them. No human force can now shut them. Thus we sit exposed to wind and wet by day and by night we are invaded by flocks of white moths. The rain falls, and the birds never give over singing, and hot sulphur fumes rise from the valleys, and the red cow in the field roars for her calf...\\". The house was used as the headmaster's residence until the late 1970s, when it was sold by the school to finance the construction of Wesley House.  School  Kent College is a Christian school, although it accepts pupils of all religions. Originally established as a boys' school, it took girls into the sixth form in 1973, and since 1975 it has been fully co- educational. Kent College has thirteen independent \\"sister schools\\" in Great Britain, most of which are co-educational though three, including Kent College, Pembury, are girls' schools. The shared ethos and similar characteristics of these thirteen schools may be attributed to their common connection with the Methodist Church. The school's motto is \\"Lux tua via mea\\": which means \\"Your light is my way\\". The school crest shows the three black choughs taken from the arms of Thomas Beckett and 'invicta' the white horse of the county of Kent. Curriculum Nearly all Sixth Formers go on to university in the United Kingdom or abroad. Information Technology, Music, Art and Drama have a central role in the life of the school; Dance is becoming increasingly popular, and was recently introduced as a GCSE option. Both the Junior and Senior Schools have Dyslexia Units, and the Senior School provides an International Studies Centre, where boarders whose English requires one-to- one tuition may receive it. In 2010 the school introduced the one-to-one computer learning programme, where all students are issued with an Apple laptop computer for use in every lesson and at home. Lessons and teaching resources are provided through a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). The school has won five national hockey titles in four years. Kent College has been recognised by The Daily Telegraph for its \\"outstanding\\" sporting record, and ranked as an \\"Independent School of the Year\\" in this area; facilities and coaching are available for a range of sports, including rugby, tennis, rowing, hockey, cricket, athletics, sailing, netball, squash, badminton and fencing. Inspection ‚Äì In 2009 the school was subject to an Independent School Inspection. The Report (which is available via a link on the school's website), and here, observed with regard to the Senior School that [at 2.1] \\"the school provides an excellent quality of education\\"; [at 2.2] \\"the school is able to adapt the curriculum to suit the learning needs of individual pupils\\"; [at 2.11] \\"the school achieves its aims to enable pupils to maximise their potential and to attain high levels of achievement\\"; [at 2.25] \\"the quality of teaching...is high\\"; [at 5.1] \\"pastoral care and the provision for the welfare, health and safety of pupils are outstanding\\"; [ibid] \\"links with parents and the community are excellent, as is the boarding education\\"; and [at 5.4] \\"the school has no major weaknesses\\". In 2015 the school was subject to another independent school Inspection, in which all areas of the school were judged to be 'excellent in every aspect'.independent school Inspection  Houses  The School introduced separate boarding and sporting Houses during the 1990s. Boarders are sorted into both a boarding House and a sporting House, whilst day pupils are only sorted into a sporting House. There are four sporting Houses: * Marlowe House * Chaucer House * Becket House * Augustine House There are five boarding houses at the senior school site: * Elfick House ‚Äì Boys * Gamon House ‚Äì Boys * Guilford House ‚Äì Boys * Austen House ‚Äì Girls * Wesley House ‚Äì Girls In 2011 boarding at Kent College was rated as outstanding by OfSted.In 2011 OfSted report re boarding Two other boarding Houses became defunct during the 1990s: * Lower School * Milton House Lower School was originally the designated boarding house for all boarders in the 1st and 2nd Years (Years 7 and 8). In 1996, Lower School was closed, and the Prickett Building was redeveloped as classrooms; the boarders were moved to Milton House (boys) and Austen House (girls). At the start of the 1997‚Äì1998 academic year, Milton House was combined with School House, as both Houses were located in the main school building, albeit on separate floors.  List of headmasters  Dr David Lamper joined the school as headmaster in September 2007. Below are listed the former headmasters of Kent College from 1885 to 2007: * J. Deaville (1885‚Äì1888) * L.W. Posnett (1888‚Äì1893) * J. Smallpage (1893‚Äì1897) * Rev. F.M. Facer (1897‚Äì1911) * A. Brownscombe (1911‚Äì1934) * H.J. Prickett (1934‚Äì1960) * D.E. Norfolk (1960‚Äì1977) * Dr P.E.

Carminati (2002‚Äì2007) Two school buildings have been named after previous headmasters, John Prickett and David Norfolk.  Chaplaincy  As Kent College is a Methodist school, Chapel holds a key place in the day (pupils, whatever faith they profess, are required to attend Chapel) and services are given by the chaplain, the headmaster or a visiting minister.  Junior School  Kent College Junior School The Kent College Infant and Junior School in the village of Harbledown, was formerly the home of the Victorian artist Thomas Sidney Cooper R.A., and was purchased by the Senior School in 1945. It currently has approximately 220 pupils, and the headmaster is Mr. Andrew J. Carter.

It lasted two series of six episodes each and was made by Warner Sisters, a UK-based television production company based in Ealing. The series revolved around an all-female taxi firm. The series starred Jill Baker as Patrice Jenner, a former Royal Corps of Transport warrant officer who starts up an all-women taxi firm. The first series dealt with the establishment of the business and the recruitment of a team of drivers - Scarlett (Caroline Blakiston), Janet (Louise Jameson), Sue-Lyn (Katharine Schlesinger), Aileen (Lynda Steadman), Aggie (Nimmy March) and George (Nicola Cowper). The second series explored more personal storylines involving the women, such as Patrice's relationship with her teenage daughter Beki (Lucy Speed). The first series also starred Jesse Birdsall as Julian, Patrice's love interest, however in series two Julian was played by a different actor, James Purefoy. George was a motorbike-riding, leather-clad lesbian who was dating Sacha, played by Charlotte Avery. They lived in a squat and befriended Patrice's daughter Beki - causing much concern to Patrice. George, Frankie and Sacha were the motorcyclists who made up the 'dispatch' part of the firm. Scarlett (Caroline Blakiston) was a transsexual (male to female). Sample plot: Episode 4, Season 2 \\"Which one of you is the victim?\\" This episode was directed by Diana Patrick. In this episode Scarlett picks up Mr Goodwin who suffers from agoraphobia, Sacha says she is pre-menstrual and so George agrees to take her packages. Janet picks up an illegal passenger in the street - a woman who has been raped called Jess Macdonald. She takes her to the police after some cajoling. They take swabs and she suffers numerous interviews before she is allowed to return home. Janet takes her and visits her a few days later, encouraging her to see a counsellor and Janet decides to volunteer to become one herself, however her husband Graham (Jeff Rawle) disapproves which only seems to cause more of a gap between them, as Janet is struck by a question Jess asked her earlier: \\"Why do men do this sort of thing and why do other men let them?\\" and is dissatisfied when Graham answers her saying they do it to keep power over women and the world and it's not in the interests of men who don't to stop those that do. Meanwhile, Sue-Lyn gets a job as a hostess on a gameshow called 'Knock Knock, who's there?' which has Arthur Smith as the sexist and lecherous host. Her boyfriend Billy is annoyed at the way she is objectified on the show and when Sue-Lyn is made redundant one of the crew tells her the real reason was because 'her boobs weren't big enough'. George offers to take Beki to watch her play hockey (with Sacha and Scarlett) on Saturday as Patrice has a date with Julian. Julian and Patrice end up sleeping with each other back at Patrice's flat (after Julian meets Patrice's pet rabbit) and Patrice seems insecure because Julian is a much younger man (he is 29) but defends him when her ex-lover (married man and father of Beki) Colonel North (played by Oliver Cotton) aka Alex walks in on them in bed, saying that at least Julian makes her feel attractive and that it was a mistake that she continued to see Col. North when he was never going to leave his wife for her. Bryant is seen vomiting into a toilet and then tells Patrice that she could do with a crisis manager to sort out the despatch side of the paperwork 'and your image'. When questioned on what she means about the image Bryant points out that Patrice has 'all sorts' working for her - Aggie's a dopehead, Scarlett is a transsexual and as for George!...' Patrice defends George's time in prison but Bryant says it's not just about George being an ex con - that she saw George and Sacha coming out of a gay bar the other night and that she 'better be careful with Beki' - although Patrice had been defending being gay until her daughter was mentioned. Patrice then admonishes George for letting Beki ride on the back of George's motorbike on Saturday and is clearly unimpressed by how enthusiastic Beki had been in regards to George's squat and the fact their bed was a futon/sofa bed. Aileen is having trouble with her daughter Jo- Anne, who has been playing truant from school and takes her out shopping in order to show she does care about Jo-Anne's welfare but in the dressing rooms she sees a large cut on Jo-Anne's arm and suspects her boyfriend Tony of abusing her daughter. Dale (the Australian, played by Erica Grant) says she is outraged by the treatment Jess received at the hands of the law and the courts and threatens to write to The Guardian newspaper but when she gets home she simply types 'lonely lonely lonely' onto her screen. The women all go out for an Indian meal and whilst there get harassed by some drunk men, George gets up from the table but is prevented from causing further trouble by Sacha. Scarlett however walks over to the men and sets off a rape alarm by their ears and then sprays one of them on the shirt with spray paint, which she carries with her for protection.

The ruins are protected as a category A listed building. Loudoun Castle is the former home of the Mure- Campbell family. Upon the marriage by Flora Mure-Campbell, 6th Countess of Loudoun, to Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Earl of Moira (later Marquess of Hastings), on 12 July 1804, it became the home of the Rawdon-Hastings family. While Loudoun was in the ownership of Edith Rawdon-Hastings, the ownership named encountered a change once more by the death of Sir Charles Abney- Hastings, 2nd Bt. In Edith's inheritance there was a condition from Sir Charles, a natural grandson of the 10th Earl of Huntingdon ‚Äì brother of Lady Edith's grandmother ‚Äì that by Royal Licence and Act of Parliament, whoever inherited the estate of the Abney family shall take on the surname of Abney- Hastings. The present castle was built for Flora, adjoining the 17th-century extension, and the 15th-century keep. The plans of Loudoun Castle were drawn up in 1805 by the architect Archibald Elliot.Loudoun Castle floorpans, preserved at Dean Castle. One estimate suggests that the \\"improvements\\" to Loudoun Castle between 1804 and 1811 cost over ¬£100,000 ‚Äì over ¬£3,500,000 in today's money. The massive structure, known as The Windsor of Scotland, had over 90 apartments, and was dominated by the main tower in the rear of the building. The regal library on the south front, measured 100 feet in length and contained upwards of 11,000 volumes. Archibald Elliot's plans included a large banqueting hall on the north front, but this was not built through lack of money. The plantations around the castle comprise a great variety of trees, many of them of very stately appearance and brought from America by John, fourth earl of Loudoun, who was governor of Virginia in 1756 and who during his military services in various parts of the world sent home every kind of valuable tree he met with. He also formed an extensive collection of willows selected from England, Ireland and Holland. A 300-pound stone from Loudoun Castle in Scotland was presented to Loudoun County, Virginia by the Countess of Loudoun and the Queen's representative, the Rouge Dragon, in a special ceremony. In 2015, during the 15th Earl's inaugural trip, he visited Loudoun County and posed for photos with Loudoun County Board of Supervisors Chairman Scott York. Wallace's Sword Published text from The Antiquarian ‚Äì \\"The Countess of Loudoun recently arrived at Loudoun Castle with the sword of Wallace. This sword has been reserved in Loudoun Castle from death of Wallace until five years back when it was removed by the late Marquis of Hastings to his seat in Leicestershire. On the death of the marquis in 1868 it passed into possession of the present countess who has just brought back to its old home. It will be remembered that the mother of Wallace was a daughter of Loudoun, and that on death of his uncle Sir Reginald Crawford of Loudoun ‚Äì hanged by the English at Ayr Wallace ‚Äì Wallace had the custody of his only daughter Susanna Crawford of Loudoun married a son of Sir Niel Campbell of Argyll and ancestress of the present Countess of Loudoun the hereditary custodian of the sword of William Wallace. \\"One of Wallace's swords was a treasured family possession, and was hung in Loudoun Castle's entrance hall. To give a visual perspective, the hall was around 70 feet by 30 feet, and the Wallace Sword was placed in a position of honour on the east wall.\\" Traditions A ley tunnel is said to run from Loudoun Castle, under the River Irvine, to Cessnock Castle over to the south.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg, whose seat is in the like-named municipality.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Neighbouring municipalities  Drees borders in the north on D√∂ttingen, in the northeast on Herresbach, Baar and Mittelbaar, in the east on Niederbaar, in the southeast on Nitz, in the south on Kirsbach, in the southwest on Welcherath, in the west on N√ºrburg and in the northwest on Meuspath.  History  In 1222, Drees had its first documentary mention under the name Dreyse. The word comes from the Celtic term for \\"bubbling spring\\". This is akin to the old Germanic word Thrais, for \\"bubbles\\", \\"to bubble\\" or \\"to swirl\\". The namesake mineral spring, the result of volcanic activity in the area, no longer exists. The village belonged to the Electorate of Cologne until 1794.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.  Mayor  Drees's mayor is Josef Heimer. His deputy is Klaus Brachth√§user.Drees‚Äôs council  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess embattled of seven, azure a fountain with four streams argent, and argent a cross tau, hanging from each arm a bell, gules. The partition horizontally across the middle in the pattern of a crenellated wall (\\"Per fess embattled\\") refers to the time when Drees belonged to the Electorate of Cologne Amt of N√ºrburg. The fountain is, in a way, a canting charge, referring to the municipality's name, which comes from an old Celtic word for a spring (although it hardly resembles the modern German word for this, Brunnen). The \\"cross tau\\" ‚Äì one without an upper arm ‚Äì is Saint Anthony's Cross and thus a reference to the municipality's patron saint, whose attributes include this cross and a bell, two of which also appear in these arms.Description and explanation of Drees‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  * Saint Anthony's and Saint Bernard's Catholic Church (branch church), Kapellenweg 2, quire from 17th century, biaxial aisleless church, late 18th century. * At Hauptstra√üe 5 ‚Äì timber-frame house, part of an estate complex, partly solid, latter half of 19th century. * Wayside chapel, southwest of the village on the road to Welcherath, plaster building, possibly 18th century, basalt niche cross marked \\"16?5\\" (year therefore uncertain). * Wayside cross, southeast of the village on the road to Nitz, basalt niche cross from 1646.Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district  Economy and infrastructure   Transport  Among the local roads, Kreisstra√üe 93 leads northwards towards D√∂ttingen and to Bundesstra√üe 258.

Location Adjacent plantations: *Oaklawn Plantation in the northeast and southwest *Horseshoe Plantation to the north. Pine Hill's plantation house was located north of Oaklawn Plantation home on Thomasville Road. Today the developments of Killearn Lakes Plantation, large private homes, and several commercial interests are on Pine Hill. The area is known as Bradfordville. Plantation specifics Pine Hill Plantation House 1880 The Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows that Pine Hill Plantation had the following: * Improved Land: * Unimproved Land: * Cash value of plantation: $28,000 * Cash value of farm implements/machinery: $1500 * Cash value of farm animals: $5000 * Number of slaves: 130 * Bushels of corn: 4000 * Bales of cotton: 225 During March 1857 the \\"black measles\\" hit Pine Hill killing several people. Pine Hill was situated amid rolling hills and green forests, with little streams that fed one of the nearby lakes. The plantation had a large stately mansion painted green and white and which stood in a grove of pines. The mansion was surrounded by gardens of roses and a variety of shrubbery as well as lawns. Thoroughbred Kentucky horses, cows from Alderney and Guernsey grazed on some land. To the east of the mansion were the slaves' cabins. The plantation also had a 24 foot, one room business office with several windows and a fireplace used by Dr. Bradford. This office also served as a hospital for the sick and wounded Confederate soldiers. The owner Dr. Edward Bradford was born August 2, 1798 and was a descendant of Oliver Cromwell. Edward Bradford took turns with his brothers, Richard, Thomas and William in hosting an annual holiday celebration, for the slave populations of Water Oak Plantation, Walnut Hill Plantation, and Edgewood Plantation every 4 July. This included a massive barbecue and, when held at Water Oak, fishing parties on Lake Iamonia. No whites were allowed to partake of or interfere with these festivities. Records from 1840-1866 show transactions with commission merchants and New York cotton brokers evidence that a prosperous business was transacted at Pine Hill. Dr. Edward Bradford was a signee to the Southern Rights Association of Centreville District on secession from the Union for \\"the protection of Southern interests and the vindication of Southern rights to preserve and protect the Constitution in its purity as the basis of Federal compact, and the only foundation on which the Union of the States was made, or on which that Union should be preserved.\\" Dr. Edward Bradford would go on to establish Horseshoe Plantation east of Lake Iamonia. Edward Bradford died in 1871. This area of plantations would later be known as Bradfordville.

The use of foreign capital in the development of the county had been a controversial issue in Liberia for many years, and continued when negotiations with Harvey Firestone led to the Firestone Concession Agreement in 1926.1926 Firestone Concession Agreement From liberiapastandpresent.org Retrieved 24 February 3l2013. The United Kingdom, which dominated the world rubber industry following World War I, enacted policies to limit the rubber supply in response to a sharp drop in prices following the war. Called The Stevenson Plan, it went into force on 1 January 1922. The Stevenson Plan was hurtful to the United States economy, as the increase of a penny per pound of rubber would mean a loss of $8 million. Firestone, angered by Britain's policies, was determined to find a way for America to grow its own rubber. Liberia was very suitable for rubber production due to its tropical, humid climate, and Firestone began making a series of agreements with Liberia to acquire land and eliminate Liberia's debts to Great Britain, culminating in the agreement of 1926. The agreement, which Firestone called \\"the greatest concession of its kind ever made\\", gave him virtually no tax obligations to Liberia, and exclusive land rights to about 10% of the country's arable land. The Liberian government, on the other hand, obligated themselves to a 5 million dollar loan from Firestone through his wholly owned subsidiary, the Finance Corporation of America. An American financial advisor appointed by the United States controlled Liberia's finances and approved the country's annual budget. These concessions, which practically made Liberia a U.S. protectorate, were opposed both inside and outside the country.

History Although the estate of Helmsley was granted to Robert, Count of Mortain following the Norman conquest; there is no evidence that he built a castle in the area. The castle, constructed in wood around 1120, was built by Walter l'Espec. It is positioned on a rocky outcrop overlooking the river Rye. Featuring double ditches surrounding a rectangular inner bailey, the castle bears little resemblance to the motte and bailey castles built at the time (such as the nearby Pickering Castle). The castle at Helmsley was only from Rievaulx Abbey and Walter l'Espec granted the land for the abbey. Aelred, who was the abbey's first novice master, was known to be involved in l'Espec's affairs (military and personally) and Helmsley was often used as a place of safety during periods of instability. Walter was childless, and on his death in 1154 the castle passed to his sister Adelina who had married Peter de Roos. In 1186 Robert de Ros, son of Everard de Ros, began work on converting the castle to stone. He built two main towers, the round corner towers and the main gateway on the south side of the castle. He died in 1227, granting the castle to his older son William who lived there from 1227 to 1258. The only change made to the castle during this time was the construction of the chapel in the courtyard. William's son, Robert, inherited the castle and was Lord of Helmsley from 1258 to 1285. His marriage to Isabel d'Aubigny (heiress to Belvoir Castle) funded the building of the new hall and kitchen, as well as strengthening the castle. This may include the building of the impressive south barbican which was constructed between 1227 and 1285. He built a wall dividing the castle into north and south sides, with the southern half for the private use of the lord's family in the new hall and east tower, and the northern half containing the old hall to be used by the steward and other castle officials. The strengthening of the castle continued into Robert's son William's life. William de Ros II died in 1316. The East Tower may have been heightened specifically for the visit of King Edward III, who stayed at the castle for around five days in 1334. Helmsley Castle remained in the possession of the de Roos family until 1478 when Edmund de Roos sold it to Richard, Duke of Gloucester who later became Richard III. Richard did nothing to the castle, staying instead at Middleham Castle. After Richard III's death at the Battle of Bosworth, Helmsley Castle was restored to Edmund de Roos by Henry VII. The remains of the East Tower Edmund died childless in 1508 and the castle passed to his cousin Sir George Manners of Etal on whose death in 1513 his son Thomas inherited it. He was created Earl of Rutland in 1525. On his death in 1543, Thomas was succeeded by his son, Henry, but it was under the rule of his grandson Edward, that the castle was altered next. He had the old hall converted into a Tudor mansion, converted the 13th-century chapel into a kitchen linked to the old hall by a covered gallery, and knocked the new hall down. The south barbican was converted into a more comfortable residence at this time. A letter of April 1578 describes the slow progress of the mason's work (and the payment of a ¬£10 sum to the mason), and that timber was available for a gallery in the attic of the mansion.Historical Manuscripts Commission, 12th Report & Appendix, part 4, Duke of Rutland, vol. 1 (1888), 116. Segrave to Rutland. On Edward's death in 1587 his brother John Manners inherited the castle, followed by John's son Roger, and then Roger's younger brother Francis. On the death of Francis in 1632 the castle passed to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham through his marriage to Katherine, Francis's daughter. During the English Civil War, the castle was besieged by Sir Thomas Fairfax in 1644. Sir Jordan Crosland held it for the king for three months before surrendering. Parliament ordered the castle to be slighted and much of the walls, gates and part of the east tower were destroyed. However the mansion was spared. The castle had by this time been inherited by George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham who married Mary, daughter of Thomas Fairfax in 1657. After his death in 1687 the castle was sold to Charles Duncombe in 1695. He was a banker and politician who was knighted in 1699 and became Lord Mayor of London in 1708. The 40,000 acre estate was purchased for the sum of ¬£90,000 (roughly ¬£11,000,000 in 2018). His sister Mary's husband, Thomas Brown, inherited the castle on Charles's death in 1711. Thomas changed his name to Duncombe. He hired William Wakefield, a prot√©g√© of Sir John Vanbrugh, to build a country house at Duncombe Park overlooking the castle, and left the castle to decay. The castle was designed as a picturesque backdrop for the Duncombe Park estate, and was even sketched by the great JMW Turner. As the castle fell into disrepair the local community took advantage of the site to hold f√™tes, pageants and even agricultural shows. The vicar of All Saints' Church, Charles Norris Gray, often held events in the castle throughout the latter part of the 19th century. The castle passed into the hands of the Office of Works in 1923 (under the guardianship of Sir Charles Peers), who began the clearing of debris and trees from the site. The castle's remarkable earthworks were planned to be part of an anti-tank defence during the Second World War. Although it is still owned by the Feversham family of Duncombe Park, the castle is now in the care of English Heritage. Helmsley Castle viewed from its walled garden to its west.

It is located in the Plovdiv Province. The town is also the centre of the Rakovski Municipality. Rakovski was founded in 1966 with the merging of three villages ‚Äî General Nikolaevo, Sekirovo and Parchevich. The new town was named after the prominent Bulgarian revolutionary Georgi Sava Rakovski. Geography and Climate The town is located in the western part of the Upper Thracian Lowland, at 25 km to the northeast of Bulgaria's second largest city Plovdiv, and has an area of 5,50 km2. Rakovski is located in a transitional continental climatic zone south of Stara Planina. The summers are hot and dry and the winters are mild, with snow remaining for about a month. History Traces of human population in the area date back since the Chalcolithic. There are remains of an ancient settlement and a Roman road at 2 km to the southeast of the town. The area was settled by Paulicians in the Middle Ages, who served as frontier guards and heavily armed infantry in the battles between the Byzantine Empire and Bulgaria between the 9th and the 14th century. Most of them fled to Nikopol on the Danube, the Second Bulgarian Empire's last stronghold, after fierce fights with the Ottomans in the end of the 14th century. There they accepted Roman Catholicism from Chiprovtsi missionaries and gradually returned to their native places. The different confession did not, however, affect the local residents' patriotic feelings, as many took part in the Bulgarian National Revival. Information about the three villages (now neighborhoods) that formed the town of Rakovski in 1966 can be found in several Ottoman tax registers. General Nikolaevo is mentioned as Kalƒ±√ßla sarƒ± and Sarƒ± Kalƒ±√ßla in 1488 and 1576, Sekirovo is denoted as Baltacilar in 1576 and Parchevich is counted under the name Ali Fakƒ±h. Religion 280px Rakovski is by far the largest predominantly Roman Catholic town in Bulgaria, with the vast majority of the population professing Roman Catholicism. There are Roman Catholic churches in all three neighborhoods, those in General Nikolaevo (built 1929) and Sekirovo serving as parish churches and being known as two of the largest Roman Catholic places of worship in this largely Eastern Orthodox part of the Balkans. Rakovski is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sofia and Plovdiv. A nunnery and a monastery are located in the town, the former being a Franciscan one dedicated to the Sacred Heart and the latter to Polish martyr Maximilian Kolbe. The Catholic Church of the 'Sacred Heart' in Rakovski is the largest in the Balkans. It was built in 1928 after the Chirpan earthquake that left it in ruins. Culture There are eight chitalishta in the Rakovski Municipality and two of them are in the town of Rakovski ‚Äî chitalishte Saints Cyril and Methodius and Prosveta. In 2003 the chitalishte Saint Cyril and Methodius was approved for receiving money for the project Chitalishta. With the help of this project an educational centre for disabled people was created in it. The chitalishte participates in a project of exchanging of library experience, financed by the American department. In 2006 it became a participant in a project of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the University of Bologna named - Tourism School which is a part of the grand Cultural tourism and intercultural environment project. The chitalishte is a co-organiser in the preparation and organization of the festival Kukove. Traditions Rakovski hosts the annual international festival called Kukove. The performers wear masks and dress as Kukeri. The festival is the biggest cultural event of this kind in the region. The participants are not only from Bulgaria but also from Greece, Serbia, Ireland, Romania and North Macedonia. The annual holiday of the wine - Vinaria-Trifon Zarezan is a tradition for the Rakovski Municipality. Another festival is held in the village of Belozem. It is called The festival of the White Stork and takes place annually in the beginning of May. In 2005 Belozem was named A European village of the white stork by the Foundation of the European Natural Heritage. The Municipality of Rakovski is also a member of the Foundation of the European Carnival Cities ‚Äî FECC. Sport For the first time in 2002 the town of Rakovski hosted The International Football Tournament for Children - United by Football. The organizers of this event were the Municipality of Rakovski, The Professional Football League, the Eparchy of Sacred Heart, the Eparchy of Saint Archangel Mihail, and the monastery Saint Maximilian Kolbe. The teams of many European countries have participated in this tournament so far, for example Poland, Croatia, Italy (AC Milan), Spain, England, Malta, Germany, Romania, Turkey (Be≈üikta≈ü, Fenerbah√ße). The Bulgarian teams of Levski, Litex, Lokomotiv Plovdiv, Botev Plovdiv, Naftex Burgas and others have also participated. The local football club Rakovski has played in republican championships for children and youths in 2002 in Italy and Germany, in 2003 in Italy and Malta, in 2004, 2006, 2007 in Italy. The club has also been a host for teams from Germany and Japan. There are four other amateur football clubs in the Municipality that play in the tournaments of Plovdiv Province. Economy Industry is of a significant importance for the economy of Rakovski Municipality. The main industries include chemicals production, textiles, and food and beverage processing. Agriculture Rakovski Municipality has traditions of developed and highly productive agriculture. The mild climate and the fertile soil are the main reasons for growing wheat, sunflower, maize, different vegetables, and fruits. There is a game-breeding enterprise near the village of Stryama called Chekeritsa. It has several bird species, deer, and hares. The enterprise has favorable conditions for ecotourism and photo-hunting. Rakovski Industrial Zone The Rakovski Industrial Zone was the first of its kind in Bulgaria. In operation since July 2004, the zone attracts investors with competitive incentives for doing business and opportunities for immediate start of production. The land that is given to the investors is with a changed statute and is licensed and ready for industrial construction.Welcome to the Future: Bulgaria's Industrial Zones Sofia News Agency 2010-11-22.

The zone is situated 14 km from the center of the province, the city of Plovdiv, and only 8 km from the Trakiya motorway. The first investor was British company William Hughes Ltd., manufacturing springs for the automotive industry.

In 1898 the company added a line from Ashley Heights to Raeford which soon became the main line with the Endon line as a branch. Shortly thereafter, the Endon branch was extended to Juniper. The main line was extended to Dundarrach in 1900, Rockfish in 1902, Fenix in 1904 and a branch from Rockfish to Hope Mills was added in 1905. For a while, Aberdeen‚ÄìHope Mills became the main line, with branches to Juniper and Fenix. On November 14, 1909, another branch from Raeford to Wagram was opened. In 1912, the company abandoned the Endon branch and used the rails to construct an extension from Fenix to Fayetteville which opened on December 23 that year.

It is situated approximatively 15 km east of Hamelin. The Municipality covers the following villages: * B√§ntorf * Behrensen * Bessingen * Bisperode * Br√ºnnighausen * Coppenbr√ºgge * Diedersen * D√∂rpe * Harderode * Herkensen * Hohnsen * Marienau  History  Coppenbr√ºgge was first documented around 1000 in a borderline description of the Bishopric of Hildesheim as Cobbanbrug mentioned. On March 9, 1062, Emperor Henry IV granted Bishop Hezilo of Hildesheim the forest ban at Coppenbr√ºgge. Built around 1200 Count Bernhard of Poppenburg, who sat on the castle Poppenburg, the mirror castle at Lauenstein. After that he called himself Bernhard von Poppenburg and Spiegelberg. The Spiegelburg was built in the valley between Ith and Osterwald on the old army and trade route near a swamp area. The road was Hellweg, which led from Aachen to K√∂nigsberg. After that it was the Reichsstra√üe 1 and today the federal highway No. 1. From 1217, Count Bernhard called himself only \\"von Spiegelberg\\". In 1226 a feud broke out between Bernhard von Spiegelberg and Bodo von Homburg. In 1238, the Homburgs conquered the castle Spiegelberg, the Counts of Spiegelberg left the country. In 1247, the Homburgs built the castle Lauenstein. In 1260 Johann von Br√ºnnighausen handed over his property to the bishop of Minden. This property was handed over to Count von Spiegelberg in 1281, which gave rise to the Counts of Spiegelberg and the main town of Coppenbr√ºgge. Around 1300, the Spiegelberg donated land to the Carmelites to build their monastery in Marienau, and in 1303 Coppenbr√ºgge Castle was rebuilt. From 1409 to 1435 the Spiegelbergs fought with the Welfish dukes for new areas on the Weser and in the valley of the Hamel (river) Hamel. The bouts ended with a complete defeat of the Spiegelbergers, but the county is preserved. In 1494, the Spiegelbergers inherited Grafschaft Pyrmont. In 1519 the Hildesheimer Stift feud broke out, the Hildesheim came into conflict with the Guelph Principalities Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel and Calenberg. This originally purely local feud developed into an altercation of Lower Saxon territorial princes, in which also the Counts of Spiegelberg were involved. The feud had only ended in 1523. Around 1540, Coppenbr√ºgge Reformed became. A little later, in 1557, Count Philip of Spiegelberg and Pyrmont fell in battle at Saint-Quentin. The rule went first from 1557 to 1584 to the Haus Lippe. From 1584 ruled the house Gleichen-Tonnaund, from 1631 the house Nassau-Dietz. He was followed at the beginning of 18 century the house Nassau-Oranien (Netherlands). In 1692, almost all town houses were destroyed in a big fire. On August 10, 1697, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great visited Coppenbr√ºgge, together with the Elector Sophia of Hanover and the Elector Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg , On September 18, 1740 came Frederick II of Prussia. 1764, the old sulfur spring was renewed in the Coppenbr√ºgger Landwehr and expanded for healing purposes. Spiegelberg came to the Westphalia in 1810, and the Vienna Congress (1815) brought the county back to the Nassau-Oranien (Netherlands). But already in 1819 Spiegelberg was sold as \\"Amt Coppenbr√ºgge\\" to the Kingdom of Hannover, it became Prussian in 1866. In 1875, the Hamelin-Hildesheim railway line was built, and a few years later (1906) Carl Netter founded Sanatorium Lindenbrunn. The Feuerhake fountain was built in 1908. He was a thank the community Coppenbr√ºgge Ernst fire hook (1850-1924), who donated a water pipe to the community. He also donated the two large colored windows in the sanctuary of St. Nicolai Church. Since 1945 Coppenbr√ºgge belongs to the state of Lower Saxony. In 1957, the outdoor pool was inaugurated. In 1958, the basic renovation of the church was completed. In 1962, the dissolution of State ownership and the sale and demolition of the buildings took place. The farmhouse became state forestry office. In 1969, the sanatorium Lindenbrunn was abandoned by its owners and sold to the association for the care of the severely handicapped. 1972/1973, the newly established hospital Lindenbrunn was inaugurated with a capacity of 255 beds.

Early life Born during World War I, the already fatherless Philippe lost his mother and five siblings when a German shell devastated the family home. Only two days old at the time of tragedy, the boy was kept alive, but barely, in the basement of his grandmother's house. He was adopted by Mrs. Edith De Lacy, who was associated with the U.S. Woman's Overseas Hospital. After the war ended, Mrs. De Lacy brought Philippe to America, where his stunning looks soon created opportunities for him as a model for magazine advertisements. His modeling assignments brought him to the attention of Hollywood, and he appeared in his first film in a bit part at the age of four. Phillipe's childhood story was used as the subject of a fictional children's book, Little Philippe of Belgium, written by Madeline Brandeis as part of her \\"Children of the World\\" series. Career Early career De Lacy freelanced for several studios in the 1920s, but mostly for Paramount. In 1924 he played the role of Michael Darling in the classic silent version of Peter Pan, with Betty Bronson. He played the young Don Juan at ten years of age in John Barrymore's Don Juan (1926), and in 1927 he played the young prince Karl Heinrich in Ernst Lubitsch's memorable The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg, which also starred Ramon Novarro and Norma Shearer. Also in 1927 he starred with Greta Garbo and John Gilbert in Love, an updated version of the Tolstoy novel Anna Karenina in which he played the young son of Anna, Serezha Karenin. When the sound era arrived De Lacy's acting career was declining, and he never made the transition from child actor to adult. Apart from his films, De Lacy also did some work in the theatre. However he had lost his boyish charm by his early teens and retired from the screen in the early 1930s. Later career De Lacy concentrated on the production end of films as a producer, director and cinematographer. He became an assistant to director Louis De Rochemont and worked with him in the 1940 film The Ramparts We Watch. Eventually he became an executive with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, a position he held for over 25 years. De Lacy‚Äôs first credit was in 1942 as an editorial associate for the US armed forces propaganda film We Are The Marines. Radio and television announcer Westbrook Van Voorhis provided the narration for the documentary, which was effectively a full-length fighting feature. In 1944 De Lacy was involved in another documentary, this time for the US Navy, filmed aboard the carrier Yorktown. The narrators in this documentary were actors Robert Taylor (who was actually a lieutenant in the navy at the time) and Charles Boyer who supplied the French narration. De Lacy was the cinematographer in The Fighting Lady and had three real life naval commanders to assist him. This film won the 1945 Oscar for Best Documentary. De Lacy then turned his hand to directing a television series in 1950, and in addition, he also became manager of a local Hollywood television station. De Lacy also co- directed the financially successful 1955 documentary film Cinerama Holiday with Robert L. Bendick. After being largely unseen for decades, the film was released on Blu-ray in 2013.Cinerama: Holiday Blu-ray Filmography *The Riddle: Woman (1920) *Without Benefit of Clergy (1921) *A Doll's House (1922) *Wasted Lives (1923) *Christmas (1923) *Divorce (1923) *Rosita (1923) *The Shooting of Dan McGrew (1924) *Peter Pan (1924) *My Neighbor's Wife (1925) *The Happy Warrior (1925) *A Lover's Oath (1925) *Don Juan (1926) *Beau Geste (1926) *The Blue Boy (1926) *Faithful Wives (1926) *Is Zat So?

With a population of about 17,000 people, it is located at an elevation of about 1350 metres above sea level. Administratively, Bambui is the headquarters of Tubah Sub-Division in the North West Region of Cameroon. Popularly known to its inhabitants as ‚Äúabeh-mbeuh,‚Äù Bambui is one of the Bamenda grassfield communities of Cameroon, and is known for its mix of modern and indigenous African life. With its lush, rolling, and fertile plains, a mild tropical climate, and an extremely industrious farming community, Bambui is the bread basket of the North West Region in particular and of Cameroon in general. Lying snug in the immense arms of the Sabga hill, Bambui is situated between Sabga and the undulating foothills that separate it with its neighbors, virtually in the shape of a bowl. Bambui is located at the cross-roads that lead to some of the North West Region's major towns of Bamenda, Ndop, Kumbo, Fundong and Nkamb√©. With its strategic location, excellent road infrastructure, and a galaxy of educational and religious institutions such as the government owned Institute of Agricultural Research and Development (IRAD), the School of Agriculture of the University of Dschang, a National Polytechnic and catholic institutions such as the Saint Thomas Aquinas Major Seminary (STAM), a Nunnery called Capuchin Friars, two communities or Convents of Reverend Sisters, as well as the hospitality of the people, Bambui is metamorphosing into a metropolis, but without compromising its culture and cultural identity. Culturally and administratively, Bambui has been a fondom in its own right for nearly 400 years. Ruled by a Paramount Chief and made up of the sub-chiefdoms of Manju, Mallam, Matulaah, Fingeh, and Alaakubeh, the people of Bambui trace their ancestry to the Tikar tribe, which originated from the Adamawa, North and Far North Regions of present-day Cameroon. Like most Bamenda grassfield fondoms, the people of Bambui migrated to their present location in waves, and led by princes or family heads who had the desire of setting up their own dynasties. The first arrivals were the people of Manju, Matulaah and Mallam who as descendants of the same family were led by their own family heads or princes. The people of Alaakubeh and Fingeh sub-chiefdoms on the other hand, migrated to Bambui much later in the 20th century from Santa sub-Division and Kom in Boyo Division following chieftaincy and/or land disputes between them and their ancestral homes. In fact, the people of Alaakubeh and Fingeh were offered residence in Bambui by the late Fon Amungwafor II who ruled the fondom from 1947‚Äì1995.

(CCN) also known as the \\"CCN Group\\" Ltd., is a subsidiary of ONE Caribbean Media Limited. In December, 2005 both the Trinidad and Tobago‚Äìbased Caribbean Communications Network (CCN) and the Barbados-based Nation Corporation entered into a merger agreement for formation of the new ONE Caribbean Media Limited company. Following the merger (officially on January 1, 2006), Caribbean Communications Network Ltd. as the larger of two companies continued to hold the aegis of the new dynamic media conglomerate based in Independence Square of Port of Spain, in Trinidad and Tobago. Prior to merger, CCN was ranked as one of the top 50 largest Caribbean companies. History The genesis of Caribbean Communication Network (CCN) was the Trinidad Express newspaper. The newspaper was founded in 1967 by a group of journalists who found themselves displaced when the British-owned Daily Mirror was brought out by foreign owners of the rival Guardian newspaper. The local group enlisted the help of a number of their country's leading businessmen and on 6 June 1967 the first paper rolled off the presses. Later, Caribbean Communication Network Group became a holding company for the Trinidad Express and other media properties. The company subsequently acquired significant holdings in a number of Caribbean media houses. On 31 August 1991 CCN television, channels 6 and 18, became the first independently operated television station in the English-speaking Caribbean, broadcasting to over 80% of Trinidad and Tobago‚Äôs population. On 24 June 1991 CCN become one of eleven radio stations in the country when it began transmission of its own radio station, Prime Radio 106FM. The group later sold 106FM in August 1995. In 1995 CCN group formed a subsidiary called Galaxy Caribbean, which began cooperation with South American Cisneros Group. After two years, CCN's Galaxy Caribbean began roll-out of DirecTV Caribbean television services to the region. After its launch in Trinidad and Tobago, CCN's Galaxy became the region‚Äôs first direct-to-home digital, satellite entertainment service and made Trinidad and Tobago only the fifth country in the world to institute DirecTV service. As CCN Group changed direction it allowed for Cisneros Group to buy Galaxy Caribbean for $9.9 million and to roll DirecTV Caribbean into the wider DirecTV Latin America. That deal was completed on 1 November 2000. Business segments The company operates CCN TV6 which is the number one privately owned television station in the Trinidad and Tobago market.
