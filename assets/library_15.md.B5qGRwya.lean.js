She came to prominence in West Berlin during the 1970s with a series of \\"larger than life\\" (\\"gro√üformatige\\") paintings of births, abortions and surgical procedures.  Biography   Provenance and early years  Meina Munsky was born the second of her parents' two daughters in Wolfenb√ºttel at the height of the Second World War. Oskar Munsky (1910-1945 or 1947), her father, was a young architect who had studied with Hans Poelzig and worked during the 1930s on several high-profile public projects such as the Reichswerke Hermann G√∂ring (industrial complex) and the rebuild of the Olypmpia Stadium underground station. He died, probably in a prisoner, of war camp when his daughter was an infant. Her mother, Gertrud Schmidt (1912-1986), worked as a photographer. Maina Munsky concluded her own schooling in March 1962 when she left the Anna-Vorwerk-Oberschule (as her secondary school was known at that time) with a Realschulabschluss (middle-school course completion certificate). For the next three years she studied with the artist Peter Voigt at the Braunschweig University of Art (\\"Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste Braunschweig\\" / HBK). Student years In 1963, after falling in love with a professor at the HBK in Braunschweig, Munsky became pregnant and had an abortion which necessitated a trip to Amsterdam, since having an abortion in Germany would have created a risk of criminal charges. The experience can be seen as having triggered a subsequent artistic theme.Jan Sch√ºler: Die Angst wegmalen. √úber die Geburt, den Tod und die Wandlung im Leben. In: Maina-Miriam Munsky. Die Angst wegmalen. Bestandsverzeichnis der Gem√§lde und Zeichnungen 1964‚Äì1998. Verlag Kettler, B√∂nen 2013, , pp. 18, ,26, 28, 30-32, 36, 38 Supported by a bursary, from 1964 till 1967 she continued her studies at the Fine Arts Academy in Florence. She studied with Ugo Capocchini and emerged with an Italian qualification as a primary school teacher. While in Florence she underwent an image makeover, colouring her blonde hair black: it remained black for the rest of her life. She also changed to dressing exclusively black and changed the name on her birth certificate from \\"Meina Munsky\\" to \\"Maina- Miriam Munsky\\". The Jewish provenance of the name \\"Miriam\\" was significant. Between 1966 and 1970 she was in West Berlin, studying at the Berlin University of the Arts (known at that time as the \\"Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste\\" / HdK), where she studied with Alexander Camaro and Hermann Bachmann. She had her first solo exhibition in 1968. It was during her time at the HdK that she produced her first paintings of embryos in the womb. Peter Sorge There are indications that Meina Munsky started a teenage romance with the artist Peter Sorge during their school days, but the two later drifted apart. In any case, in the later 1960s, when she was keen to investigate the possibilities for exhibiting her paintings, Munsky and Sorge met up. He arranged her first solo exhibition in 1968. It opened in February of that year at the \\"K√ºnstlerselbsthilfegalerie\\" (loosely, \\"Artists' Self-help gallery\\") at Gro√üg√∂rschen 35 where back in 1964 Sorge, already a successful young graphic artist, had been a founding member of the \\"Gro√üg√∂rschen exhibition community\\". The Gro√üg√∂rschen gallery occupied one floor of a former factory building in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg. The artists of the so-called \\"Gro√üg√∂rschen group\\", who later became known as the \\"New Realists\\", held a generally sceptical attitude towards societal conventions, and drew inspiration from artists such as George Grosz, Hannah H√∂ch and John Heartfield, along with the collage creators and Dadaism. Maina-Miriam Munsky and Peter Sorge married one another in 1970. That same year Munsky became a member of the German Artists' Association (\\"Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund\\"): she exhibited at the associations' annual exhibitions till 1984. The couple's son, Daniel Ben Sorge, was born in December 1972.Frank Nicolaus: Zuspruch und Kritik in Rufweite wissen. Art-Serie K√ºnstlerpaare. Peter Sorge und Maina- Miriam Munsky, in: art ‚Äì Das Kunstmagazin, Nr. 9/September 1986, pp. 76‚Äì85. The young artist Munsky was one of the founding members of the Berlin Aspect Group (\\"Gruppe Aspekt\\") which existed between 1972 and 1978. Some of the other more prominent members included the artists Hermann Albert, Bettina von Arnim, Ulrich Baehr, Hans-J√ºrgen Diehl, Arwed Gorella, Wolfgang Petrick, Joachim Schmettau and Klaus Vogelgesang, as well as her husband.Aspekt Gro√üstadt. Ausstellungskatalog, K√ºnstlerhaus Bethanien/ Gruppe Aspekt, Berlin 1977. During the 1970s she had her first museum sales. The Museum of Modern Art and the German Federal Republic Art Collection each acquired a work by Munsky. In a newspaper piece dated 2 May 1975 the art historian Katrin Sello wrote, \\"It is no criticism of the impersonal objectivity of modern gynecology, even if Maina-Miriam Munsky is included among the 'Critical Realists' in Berlin, and belongs to the 'Aspect Group'. The pictures provoke for quite other reasons. By setting before the viewer the real birth process without sublimation into idyll or mythology, they violate taboos and mobilise the total resistance of those confronted by them, forcing the viewer to turn away and abruptly reject what is before him or her, because of the way they stir up a traumatic frontier\\". \\"Women Artists International Exhibition 1877-1977\\" Controversially, Maina-Miriam Munsky was excluded from taking part in the \\"Women Artists International Exhibition 1877-1977\\" (\\"K√ºnstlerinnen international 1877-1977\\") held in the orangery at the Charlottenburg Palace. The \\"Women Artists International\\" was widely seen as the most important exhibition of women's art to date. Five hundred works by 190 female artists were on display: those who featured included Louise Nevelson, Paula Modersohn- Becker, M√©ret Oppenheim, Georgia O'Keeffe, Eva Hesse, Bridget Riley, K√§the Kollwitz, Sonia Delaunay and Gabriele M√ºnter. The jury members came from the New Society for Visual Arts which had been founded in 1969. They were all women. They justified the decision to exclude Maina-Miriam Munsky with the argument that the uninvolved presentation of her birth pictures was \\"unwomanly\\" (\\"nicht weiblich\\"). Separately they accused the artist of being involved with the sexist pictures produced by her artist husband, Peter Sorge, whose drawings combined photographs from pornographic magazines with scenes of violence. During the early 1970s Munsky had seemed to distance herself from the rising tide of feminist solidarity. Asked about her position as a woman in the world of art she repeatedly and very publicly spoke out against women's groups closing ranks in ways that only created new structures of isolation. One reason that the exclusion of Muncky's work from the \\"Women Artists International\\" became so contentious was the last minute nature of the decision. Her contribution had already been commissioned: the exhibition jury decided to remove it just before the exhibition catalogue was finalised for the printers. In an interview with Prof. Dr. C√§cilia Rentmeister which was publisher in March 1977 Munsky was uncompromisingly supportive of the women's movement:: : \\"I have always taken a deep interest in these women's movement groups that were supportive in the abortion debate. About that I always thought to myself: hey, that's exactly what you want, why not go along with it? But there was also always the fear, dear God, of something else eating you up. And then that is one thing - or with the child two things - eating you up. But I certainly think the women's movement important, and I also believe that for our generation it is something that in the time left to us deserves to be supported, here, there and everywhere\\". Career progression Between 1979 and 1981 the itinerant exhibition \\"feministische kunst internationaal\\" (\\"feminist art international\\") took place in museums in the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden: several Munsky painting were included.feministische kunst internationaal. Ausstellungskatalog, Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag 1979, pp. 13, 37, 48, 84, 103. Recognition of Munsky in arts circles reached a high- point in 1982 when her six part set, \\"The Red Cloth\\" was exhibited alongside works by Frida Kahlo and Tina Modotti at an exhibition held at the Kunstverein in Hamburg.Bilder von gewaltigen M√§chten. In: Hamburger Abendblatt, Nr. 176, 2. August 1982, p. 13. Between 1982 and 1984 she had a guest professorship for basic arts teaching at the Braunschweig University of Art (\\"Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste Braunschweig\\" / HBK) in Braunschweig. In 1984 she received the Lower Saxony Arts Prize. In 1988 she held a guest professorship at the Pentiment International Summer Academy of the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. In 1990 she became a member of the K√ºnstlersonderbund (artists' league), a somewhat alternative organisation that emerged that year as a breakaway movement from the German Artists' Association (\\"Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund\\"). Further teaching assignments followed. Death Maina- Miriam Munsky was just 56 when she died in 1999 as a result of her alcohol intake. Peter Sorge died three months later. Their bodies share a grave at the Alter St.-Matth√§us-Kirchhof (churchyard) in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg. In 2013 a first inventory of Munsky's work was compiled by Jan Sch√ºler and published under the title \\"Die Angst wegmalen\\" (loosely, \\"Paint away the worry\\") by the Berlin- based Poll Art Fountation, who had represented the artist while she was alive. Works Along with people such as Peter Sorge, Klaus Vogelgesang, Wolfgang Petrick and Ulrich Baehr, Maina-Miriam Munsky represented the artists of Critical realism which emerged as an artistic movement in West Berlin at the end of the 1960s. It is true these artists did not adhere to any fixed programme, but there were nevertheless things that they shared in common beyond simply an aspiration to interpret realism. They identified the need to differentiate their approach from American Photorealism and Hyperrealism, and dubious claims to reflect political experience in artistic work.Prinzip Realismus, exhibition catalogue produced by the DAAD, the Goethe-Institut, M√ºnchen and the Galerie Poll, Berlin 1972. Munsky prepared her works by creating from which she then transferred to canvas with the help of a Slide projector. She was indeed not a photorealist in the usual sense, but oriented herself towards \\"new reality\\", applying a \\"verismo\\" approach that referenced the 1920s. In her pictures she rearranges the patterns and adapted the overall image by reducing it to essentials and applying a rigidly structured composition. Often her backgrounds use a monochrome presentation so that the viewer will not be distracted from the main subject matter. Her artistic themes revolved around conditions and processes such as pregnancy, birth, surgical operations and death. In pieces such as \\"Emancipation\\" and \\"Twins I and II\\" she features clinical spaces and medical equipment. She became known through her social-psychological presentations in these subject areas. She impressively \\"documented\\" with sober precision the potential for photorealism from the delivery room. Munsky started producing pictures of births in 1967, which violated a taboo and met with resistance. She painted these early depictions of embryos, bodily hints, photographs and birth scenes applying a soft flowing style captured in lattice-structures, scaffolds, cages and lines. Her works from this period sometimes recall the surrealist forms from the pictures of Salvador Dali or the works of Francis Bacon. In 1970, after undergoing an appropriate vetting process by a commission, she was permitted to spend nine months with the gynaecologist Erich Saling at the Gynaecological Clinic in Berlin-Neuk√∂lln. She was able to work in the delivery room, photographing during births and birth-related operations. Rolf Brockschmidt: Chronistin der modernen Klinik. F√ºr die Malerin Maina-Miriam Munsky steht der Mensch im Mittelpunkt. (Gesichter der Gro√üstadt). In: Der Tagesspiegel, Nr. 11487, 10 July 1983, p. 39. After that her pictures acquired a more concrete and stronger form, while the situations they depicted became more readily recognisable. It was more than twenty years after embarking on her pictures themed on births and operations that she moved away from those topics. In 1989 she painted a series of pictures of sombre and unoccupied rooms, along with views out through faint window panes and house fronts.

The festival ¬´Bratya¬ª was first held in July 2005 and since are being held every summer. Since 2008, the winter session of festival \\"Bratya\\", also called \\"Bratya in Winter\\" was added, and is held annually on February. The summer festival is held as an open-air tent camp event, winter one is usually based in hotels and less populous. To date, 26 festivals have been held, 15 of them in summer and 11 in winter. The venue of the festival changes every time, but periodically the festival returns to the original venue on field of Borodino near Mozhaysk.  Creation the festival  The festival was initiated by Oksana Shashuto's dance studio from the town of Mozhaisk, created in 1994. In August 1997, they went on tour in Paris, where the 12th Catholic World Youth Day was held, which was visited by over a million people. Oksana Shashuto liked the idea: lectures, worships, concerts.–ê–ª—Å—É –ò–¥—Ä–∏—Å–æ–≤–∞ –£–¢–†–û–ú –ú–û–õ–ò–¢–í–ê, –í–ï–ß–ï–†–û–ú TA–ù–¶–´ // –ï–∂–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –ü–æ–¥–º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—å–µ, 23.07.2005, —Å. 2 According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"This was a very big work with young people. While we, - that was in '97 - had almost nothing yet, even any camps. And it turned out that we were so close in temper that I began to think: 'Why don't we have this and can't we do something to try to get started?'\\". At the same time, such events in Russia and the CIS countries were held mainly by Protestants or Catholics, who had considerable experience in holding such events abroad; as Olga Prorok, a journalist from Kyiv, wrote in 2005: \\"Why, if we hear about an event for youth where speak about God, we confidently say: 'It is sectarians'? And, what is most regrettable, we almost always guess. Looking at the children's camps, skillfully organized by overseas preachers, who hike tours and fascinating excursions, we complain about nimble sectarians who lead inexperienced young children to their sect. And why are we, Orthodox ones, not able to organize anything like this, with rare exceptions?\\". In the Russian Orthodox Church, at that time, at best, diocesan or parochial summer camps existed, however, by no means everywhere. Oxana Shashuto at the 2019 summer festival And then Oksana Shashuto and her husband Yaroslav Yerofeyev (they got married in 2004) had the idea to hold a church-wide youth festival in order to \\"share inter-regional experience, regardless of geographical boundaries\\". The idea of unity was set in the very name of the festival. As priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev noted: \\"We conceived this festival in 2004, when the tendencies towards the separation of fraternal peoples had already begun to penetrate into the public consciousness. But we wanted to show that we are all one in Christ, that no political party can rally people as Christ does\\". Oksana Shaushto at that time had the experience of organizing a dance festival: \\"We looked at it, asked around, talked, and when I began to figure out Orthodox themes, we decided to make a festival\\". In addition to the task of togetherness, the organizers tried to bring the festival and the educational component, and also sought to show that young people go to the Orthodox Church, to break the stereotype about the dullness of life of believers and to prove to the young people that they are not alone in their pursuit of God–Æ–ª–∏—è –ö—É—Å—Ç–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞ ¬´‚Äû–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—å—è –∑–∏–º–æ–π‚Äú ‚Äî –≤ –°–∞–ª–∞–≤–∞—Ç–µ!¬ª // ¬´–£—Ñ–∏–º—Å–∫–∏–µ –µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –≤–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª, ‚Ññ 2 (323), —Ñ–µ–≤—Ä–∞–ª—å 2017, —Å—Ç—Ä. 14. At the same time, the idea to hold an Orthodox youth festival was not imposed by anyone; in fact, the festival itself was initiated by the young people themselves. The initiative was supported by Metropolitan Juvenal (Poyarkov) of Krutitsy and Kolomna, Dean of the Mozhaisk Deanery of the Moscow Oblast Diocese hieromonk Daniel (Zhirnov), the head of the Mozhaisk District Vladimir Nasonov. According to Yaroslav Yerofeyev: \\"Everyone perceived this idea very correctly and gave every assistance. The day was chosen, the place, the guys were prepared\\". The first volunteers who organized the festival were high school students who had studied at the Oksana Shashuto Dance Studio. The Borodino field was chosen as place of the festival since it was place of \\"military exploits of our ancestors in 1812 and 1941,\\". To inform potential participants about the festival information was posted on the Internet. The first festival was held since July 18 to July 24, 2005, from Monday to Sunday. Both participants and organizers of the festival lived in simple tents. The food was brought from the school cafeteria of Mozhaisk. Already at the first festival a general concept was evolved; the organizers adhered it hereinafter: services, lectures of invited guests, excursions to the surrounding sights, improvised concerts on the stage specially built during the festival, an auditorium under an awning next to it, \\"bonfire\\" with songs and informal communication, mini-conversations (at the first festival they were called \\"round tables\\"), festival procession to the Kolotsky Monastery, the prohibition of drinking and smoking in the camp, playing the angels, and the night liturgy, followed by almost all the participants of the festival Communion, many for the first time. According to eyewitnesses, the festival was \\"with an unprecedented rise\\". When parting, the participants embraced each other and then declared that such holidays should be held constantly. For holding this festival and \\"missionary and educational activities among youth,\\" the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Vladimir (Sabodan), in October of the same year awarded Oksana Shashuto the order of the Rev. Nestor the Chronicler. Immediately after the end of the first festival, the organizers began to prepare for the second one. The site www.bratia.ru was organized, its participants began to visit each other, to communicate. On October 29, 2006, Yaroslav Yerofeyev was ordained a priest and became the spiritual father of the festival. As the number of participants increased, the organizers decided to hold festivals in other localities. In addition, \\"for those who do not want to part with the Summer Festival \\"Bratya\\" for a long time and with everyone with whom he became friends and became so close during this time\\"http://zima.bratia.ru: ¬´–¥–ª—è —Ç–µ—Ö, –∫—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Ö–æ—á–µ—Ç –Ω–∞–¥–æ–ª–≥–æ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —Å –ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–º –§–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª–µ–º ‚Äû–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—å—è\\" –∏ —Å–æ –≤—Å–µ–º–∏, —Å –∫–µ–º –æ–Ω —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–¥—Ä—É–∂–∏–ª—Å—è –∏ —Å—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∏–ª—Å—è –∑–∞ —ç—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è¬ª it was decided to open the winter session of the festival. The winter festival was first held in February 2008 in the village of Ust-Chorna in Zakarpattia Oblast. It had fewer concerts, but more lectures and conversations with priests. The summer festival of the same year was held near Kyiv. Since then, \\"in order to strengthen friendly relations and cultural traditions between the youth of different countries\\", the festival venue changed every time, but the festival regularly returned to the Borodino field, becoming a kind of visiting card of the Mozhaysky District.

Festival goals and objectives   Association of Orthodox Youth  The festival organizers aim to unite Orthodox youth from various countries, regardless of state borders and ethnic differences, to give an opportunity to communicate with each other, to expand their circle of friends by several dozen people, to \\"give each other the love and warmth of their hearts\\". Mainly these efforts were aimed at uniting young people from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. According to Oksana Shashuto, the goal of the festival is \\"to bring young people from different cities and different countries together, to show that Orthodox people live everywhere, that there are many of us, and we can be together. <...> No boundaries can divide us, and no politicians are able to embroil\\". This goal became particularly relevant after the outbreak of hostilities in eastern Ukraine and the serious complication of relations between the three Eastern Slavic states in 2014. The very name of the festival, according to Oksana Shashuto, \\"most accurately conveys the unity and brotherhood of all, and not isolation in individual parishes\\". General photo of the participants of the 2019 Summer Festival The festival organizers also set as their goal \\"the embodiment in the life of the brotherhood, friendship and unity of the Orthodox Church\\". As noted by Priest Vyacheslav Haplichnik, who organized the winter festival of 2013: \\"The festival is a unique platform for communication of Orthodox youth from different countries. Because people can lose unity. The composition of the Russian church is very large. Often, Ukraine does not have contacts with Lithuanian youth, and Moscow does not know Belarus. And here very strong ties are established for many years\\". In 2005, Olga Prorok described the goals of the organizers in this way: \\"Absolutely human communication is necessary for absolutely everyone, including the Orthodox. Through joint prayer, works, games of the heart are thawed, they become cleaner and more tender - they open up for the neighbor, and therefore for God\\". Alina Ryazanova wrote in 2011: \\"At the festival, many young people understand that they are not alone in their faith and good deeds, that Orthodoxy does not disappear, but, on the contrary, continues to exist, expanding more and more\\". At the same time, according to Oksana Shashuto, the festival failed to achieve its main goal - \\"to gather and unite the youth who came to the Orthodox Church\\". If initially the organizers of the festival \\"Bratya\\" characterized it as \\"An unprecedented event in the world of youth and Orthodox Christianity\\", over time similar events for Orthodox youth began to appear in many dioceses, and many of their organizers gained experience specifically on \\"Bratya\\" festival. \\"People who come to us were delighted with the fact that we are here all together, and then they leave for themselves, and in the diocese they are told to do the same with them. Then we can not get any good priests, nor young people, because they all put on certain roles, and they should now make mini-Bratya themselves. We beg to invent something of our own, to take advantage of the rich imagination and knowledge. But even adults in Moscow with knowledge and money are still trying to duplicate everything that we do. <...> It would be cool if there were several major different activities and you could ride them. But people cannot come simply because they have been asked to be counselors, organizers in another place, and priests must hold conversations there <...> Over the years, this has become increasingly apparent, and we don't know at all what to do about it. New people come, but also dissolve\\". Thus, in 2011, the youth union of the Belarusian Orthodox Church, together with the Synodal Youth Affairs Department of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, organized the annual youth educational forum \\"Quo vadis?\\" In Belarus; In 2016, the youth department of the Moscow City Diocese created the annual youth educational volunteer forum named DobroLeto;–ñ–î–Å–ú –¢–ï–ë–Ø –ù–ê –§–û–†–£–ú–ï ¬´–î–û–ë–†–û–õ–ï–¢–û. –¢–ï–†–†–ò–¢–û–†–ò–Ø –í–ï–†–´¬ª –ú–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–∂–Ω—ã–π –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –µ–ø–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–∏ in 2018, the Synodal Department of the UOC on Youth Affairs organized the Orthodox Youth Festival \\"OrthoFest\\".  Educational and cognitive  According to Oksana Shashuto, while preparing for the first festival, \\"the organizers mainly pursued educational goals. We wanted to tell the young about Orthodoxy, to introduce them to the faith\\". For this, according to the priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev, \\"we invite people who may and able to speak in a living, ordinary human tongue. Not in the language of books and catechism, but in a living language to talk about the basics of the faith\\". The organizers seek to invite to the festival bright church preachers and generally interesting people who can also tell about their path to God. According to a long-term participant of the festival and the organizer of the School of Volunteers Victoria Anikeyeva: \\"The main goal of the festival is educational. <...> It is assumed that people will not just rest, and I assure you that they will communicate well, but will nevertheless take away some fruits from this festival\\". In addition to lectures, the program of festivals provides for intellectual and educational games, excursions, master classes. Archimandrite Jonah (Cherepanov) noted in 2011: \\"It is amazing how young people have an unfulfilled thirst for knowledge about Orthodoxy, how much the guys are eager to hear the answers to the most important questions from the mouth of the priest. It is insulting to tears for them, that they cannot talk at home with the priest, many people cannot really confess\\". According to the priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev: \\"The main idea of the festival is the selection of such events that would give young people the opportunity to understand the meaning of life for themselves, and with the help of numerous faith friends strengthen themselves in the correctness of the chosen path\\". The organizers of the festival strive to show to young people the \\"beauty of Orthodox Christianity, to reveal it in all possible directions. And so that those who came to church - strengthened their faith, who only watched, came for the company to gain this faith\\". From the very beginning of the festival, its organizers tried to introduce an element of patriotic education of young people. In addition, the organizers during the first festivals sought to attract patriotic youth: \\"Everyone who considers themselves young and all for whom Holy Russia and Orthodox Faith are dear is invited!\\" - an 2013 advertisement stated..  Creativity  ¬´Mozhaisk Hares¬ª. 2008 summer festival. Although initially the main purpose of the festival was educational, a creative component was also provided, which was done not only to raise the mood of the festival participants, but also to debunk the idea of Orthodox young people as closed and notorious people, to show that Orthodox youth are \\"involved in creativity and in various arts,\\" and the secular program of theater, dance groups, musicians, bards, and rock poets is completely compatible with the Orthodox faith. Archpriest Evgeny Gening, chairman of the Moscow Oblast Diocese Department for Work with Youth, supported this initiative in 2005: \\"The life of the church is determined not only by monastic charters and traditions, although, of course, it occupy a significant place in Orthodox Christianity. But this is not the whole church life, there must be a place for creativity, for a variety of different forms. <...> There are no violations of the canons of the church in that young people sing songs about human life, soul, relationships, and decent dances. <...> We breed in different directions [pop music and] liturgical traditions, sanctified by the thousand-year experience of the Church, where the appearance of the guitar is excluded. But if the same guitar is used in the creativity - for God's sake, the creativity of us only unites us\\".–ê–ª—Å—É –ò–¥—Ä–∏—Å–æ–≤–∞ –£–¢–†–û–ú –ú–û–õ–ò–¢–í–ê, –í–ï–ß–ï–†–û–ú –¢–ê–ù–¶–´ // –ï–∂–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –ü–æ–¥–º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—å–µ, 23.07.2005, —Å. 2: \\"–ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –º–æ–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—ã—Ä—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —É—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞–º–∏ –∏ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è–º–∏, —Ö–æ—Ç—è, —Ä–∞–∑—É–º–µ–µ—Ç—Å—è, –æ–Ω–∏ –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞—é—Ç —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –≤ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏–∏. –ù–æ —ç—Ç–æ –µ—â–µ –Ω–µ –≤—Å—è —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å, –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ –±—ã—Ç—å –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –∏ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É, –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏—é —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º. –ü–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É –Ω–µ—Ç –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ —É–¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –º–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–∂–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª—è \\"–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—å—è\\", –ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ–¥–∞ –º–µ—Ä–æ–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∏—è –ø—Ä–æ—Ö–æ–¥—è—Ç –¥–∞–≤–Ω–æ. –û–¥–Ω–æ –∏–∑ —Å–∞–º—ã—Ö –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω—ã—Ö - –ø—Ä–æ—à–µ–¥—à–∏–π –≤ –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥–µ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ—Ä—Ç –≤–µ—Ä—É—é—â–∏—Ö —Ä–æ–∫-–º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–Ω—Ç–æ–≤, –Ω–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º —Å –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –∫ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–º –≤—ã—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–ª–æ –¥—É—Ö–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –ù–µ—Ç –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –∫–∞–Ω–æ–Ω–æ–≤ —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏ –≤ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –º–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–∂—å –ø–æ–µ—Ç –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏ –æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏, –¥—É—à–µ, –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ö, —Ç–∞–Ω—Ü—É–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–∞–Ω—Ü—ã. –¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –ú—ã —Ä–∞–∑–≤–æ–¥–∏–º –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –±–æ–≥–æ—Å–ª—É–∂–µ–±–Ω—ã–µ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏, –æ—Å–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ç—ã—Å—è—á–µ–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–º –æ–ø—ã—Ç–æ–º —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏, –≥–¥–µ –ø–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≥–∏—Ç–∞—Ä—ã –∏—Å–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–æ. –ù–æ –µ—Å–ª–∏ —Ç–∞ –∂–µ –≥–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–∞ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ - —Ä–∞–¥–∏ –±–æ–≥–∞, —Ç–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –æ–±—ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω—è–µ—Ç.\\" Already in preparation for the first festival, the organizers sought to involve Orthodox youth in the music, theater, and dance arts to participate in it. According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"The goal of the festival performances is to show that there are talents in Orthodox Church, and to find them\\". About the first concert at the first festival of 2005, Olga Prorok wrote: \\"It turns out that the Orthodox people also know how to sing, dance, and humor. Yes, everything is so nice, kindly, not at all like in hackneyed pub scenes\\". As Arina Ivanova noted: \\"Everyone who has some talent can apply it: sing, dance, if the organizer has the capacity to be a volunteer, know how to do something with your own hands, hold a master class\\".http://blogs.pravkamchatka.ru/hronos/?p=815 As Oksana Shashuto noted in 2017, compared with the first festivals, \\"entertainment has increased, but we have determined for ourselves that we will not do a party\\".  Preparation and implementation   Selection of venue  The organizers of the festival are Mozhaysk deanery with the participation of the diocesan department of the Moscow Regional Diocese for Youth Affairs and the Mozhaysk Administration with the assistance of the benefactors of this town and region. In other venues, co-organizers are local Orthodox organizations and administrations. The festival organizers work with representatives of various dioceses and organizations, and therefore any of the cities of the post-Soviet space can become the host of the next festival \\"Bratya\\". If agreement is reached, the organizers begin preparations for the festival with them, and such negotiations can begin several years before the festival itself is held in a particular place. As priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev noted: \\"Everything depends on the local organizers. That is, in this case we are already acting as consultants, we are looking for the program to be filled with those events that are characteristic of the festival, so that the spirit of the festival itself is preserved. And the organizers who are on the ground help us all, they are very experienced people, we don't just trust anyone to organize the festival\\". Also in 2013, Oksana Shashuto noted that \\"often the people to whom we turn do not fulfill their promises. A lot of things break down at the last moment, because of which, of course, the quality suffers\\". All festivals are held with the blessing of the ruling bishop of the diocese in area of which its are held. For each festival, the organizers choose their motto; as a rule, this is a quotation from the New Testament. The motto becomes visible on the festival site already at the beginning of registration for the festival.  Festival funding and participation fee  The festival \\"Bratya\\" has no permanent external sources of funding. Sponsorship throughout the history of the festival was irregular and insufficient. According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"The Lord does not send us money, sponsors, and we cannot do anything with it. Maybe sometime this will change, but it already seems that our destiny is unmercenariness\\". On the official festival website there is a page \\"Help for the festival\\" with bank details, where it is written: \\"any financial assistance is very much required for the festival\\".–ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –ú–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–∂–Ω—ã–π –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –§–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª—å ¬´–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—å—è¬ª In such circumstances, the main source of funding are contributions from the participants of the festival. At the same time, the organizers try not to inflate fees, making participation in the festival as accessible as possible for Orthodox youth, who, in addition to the festival, have to pay for the road to it, which makes it difficult for young people from remote regions of Russia to participate in the festival. In addition, traveling from remote regions is not only expensive, but also long. So the participant of the summer festival of 2014 from Abakan traveled by train to the Borodino field for 3 and a half days.. For this reason participants from distant regions of Russia can count on some discount if they needTerms and conditions at official website of the festival. Volunteers who organize and support the work of the festival not get money for their work, even if it is heavy. Moreover, they even had to pay for their participation in the \\"School of Volunteers\\", since the festival failed to receive a grant. The clergy participate in the festival for free. That is, administration do not take money for living and boarding, but they not receive any remuneration. Priests come to the festival on their own initiative and for the sake of communicating with young people. Participants pay participation in the festival either directly by transferring money to the accounts of the organizers, or through contact persons. When registering for the summer festival of 2015, the \\"Generous\\" fee was introduced when the participant, when paying for his participation in the festival, could voluntarily transfer 500 and more rubles more. This was done so that those with insufficient funds could come to the festival.–°—Ç–µ–Ω–∞.  Festival participants  280px The festival was created for active young people who are ready to live in simple conditions, are interested in Orthodoxy, open to new knowledge, want to relax their souls and make new friends. The overwhelming majority of the festival participants come from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus. They wrote about the summer festival of 2006: \\"the festival gradually brought up a sense of internationalism in young souls. He was truly international: the whole week in the glade were heard then the Belarusian speech, then the Ukrainian language, then the Smolensk talk, then the Moscow one - in a singing tone and the akanye-ed - talk\\". Participants also come from other countries: Moldova, Serbia, Poland, Lithuania. At the first festivals, a very significant part of the participants came from Ukraine, and many of them belonged to the youth community of the Ioninsky monastery in Kyiv, the abbot of which was Archimandrite Jonah (Cherepanov) (from 2011 - the bishop, from 2017 - the archbishop) festival for several years every year came to him at the head of a group of young people from Ukraine, so at the summer festival in 2011 the number of participants from Ukraine reached 200. Over time, the number of participants from Ukraine began to decline, due to the sharp deterioration of Russian-Ukrainian relations in 2014, the high cost, and the fact that many of its youth movements and events appeared in Ukraine, including the Orthodox festival \\"OrthoFest\\", organized with the direct participation of Archbishop Jonah (Cherepanov). Isolated representatives of Western European countries also come, but these are mostly Russian √©migr√©s. According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"We regularly invite Orthodox people from other European countries. But they don't intend to get here, or individual representatives come\\". After the first festival, the number of participants increased with each new festival.–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤ –ë–µ–ª–æ—Ä—É—Å—ã –Ω–∞ —Ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª–µ ¬´–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—å—è¬ª –≤ –ö—Ä—ã–º—É // ¬´–¶–∞—Ä–∫–æ—û–Ω–∞–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞¬ª, ‚Ññ 32, 2012, —Å—Ç—Ä. 15 In February 2009, Oksana Shashuto noted: \\"The participants are different, the backbone is the church youth who go to the temples. Many bring their friends <...>. People come who do not go to church at all, who are simply interested and have a lot of them\\". At the 2012 summer festival in Crimea, the number of participants reached a maximum of 1,250 people, but this also imposes its own costs: \\"the number of participants increased every year. But I can not say that it has increased in a qualitative way. More and more people came \\"for the company\\", \\"hang out\\" fans.\\" For this reason, she called the summer festival of 2012 a very unfortunate one. After that, the number of participants decreased and stabilized by —Å–∞. 400‚Äì600 people on summer festivals and —Å–∞. 150 people on winter festivals. In the early years, organized groups of 20-30 people came to the festival, then in 2017 Oksana Sashuto noted that \\"they travel in companies of 3-5 people from a parish or city\\". Approximate age limit for participants is 15‚Äì35 years. However, this is not a hard limit, but rather a recommendation. According to the priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev: \\"who comes younger - he is not interested, for example, in events devoted to education: lectures, conversations and so on. Who is over the age of 35 may not be satisfied with the concert program\\". Since the festival was conceived as a youth, initially the participation of small children was not welcomed (this was allowed as an exception with the special consent of the festival organizing committee), but over time many festival participants got families, including thanks to the acquaintance on the festival, and began to come to the festival with children. According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"the festival is developing. If earlier we didn't welcome children at the festival at all, then <...> in recent years we agree, as it were, if Orthodox families have no one to stay children with, they bring them to the festival\\". To participate in the festival, it is necessary to pay a fee for participation in the festival in certain periods, then fill out and send a questionnaire on the festival website and receive confirmation If the festival holds in Russia non-Russian citizens under the age of 18 years it is necessary to have a notarized statement of the consent from their parents (or guardians) letting them go overseas together with an indication of duration of the trip and a country that they are going to visit Russian Federation. A letter of authority is confirmed on the attendant who has reached the age of 18 years.  Volunteers  Hand-in-hand volunteers. 2017 Summer festival. Volunteers are called upon to organize the preparation and holding of the festival and help its participants, especially newcomers. Volunteers are given specially prepared for them red shirts with the emblem of the festival. Volunteers set up their tents separately from other participants. The number of volunteers attracted by the organizers varies depending on how many people enrolled in the festival. Initially, the volunteers, as well as the organizers of the festival, were from Mozhaisk and were part of the youth group at St. Nicholas Cathedral in Mozhaisk. However, beginning with the second festival, volunteers began to recruit from among experienced and responsible participants from different cities who attended the festival. At the initiative of the director of the festival \\"Bratya\\" Oksana Shashuto and the spiritual father of the festival priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev, a \\"School of Volunteers\\" was organized. As Victoria Anikeeva noted: \\"It's good when the guys are called to be volunteers, but if there is no proper preparation and there is no single scheme and system, then everything can fall apart. And therefore it became clear that the team should be prepared seriously\\". For the first time, the \\"School of Volunteers\\" was held from July 9 to July 14, 2017 at the Borodino field, just before the festival held there. The second \\"School of Volunteers\\" was held July 28 to August 3, 2018, also directly in front of the festival. Upon completion of training, participants receive certificates from the Synodal Department of Youth Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church for attending a volunteer school. The goal of the school of volunteers is not only to give its students knowledge, but also to rally them into a single team, \\"immerse them in the atmosphere of the festival, help everyone tune in to the upcoming hard selfless work, learn to survive in difficult conditions\\". The volunteer of the festival \\"Bratya\\" should: * know the history and philosophy of the festival, be able to competently and interestingly talk about it; * not to be timid before difficulties, to have perseverance and a desire to be useful; * be benevolent: \\"Even if you make a reprimand, do it with love\\"; * be able to make a team from a group of people who are assigned to him; be able to rally participants of the festival within their group with the help of familiarity games, rallying games and other common events; be able to immerse them in the atmosphere of the festival; be able to cheer them up; * be able to functionally support the work of the festival: build a camp (kitchen, toilets, showers, washstands), make a fire (this is allowed only for volunteers), raise and pack a camp, be on duty at the distribution of food and stuff; * be able to organize various events within the framework of the festival: be able to speak in front of a large group of people, including holding concerts, be able to schedule events, follow the schedule to prevent chaos at the festival, and timely inform the participants of the festival about certain events; * maintain a balance between working with the group and administrative tasks; * maintain a balance between work and rest in order to avoid both overwork and insufficient workload; At the same time, not only volunteers, but also any participant of the festival can work \\"for the good of the common cause\\", performing this or that work by agreement with the organizers or volunteers.  Participation of clergy in the festival  280px The constant attribute of each festival is the participation of Orthodox clergy in it. According to Yana Sedova, \\"the feeling of unity is enhanced by the fact that the priests share with us the joys and difficulties of living in a modest tent camp\\". The priests are thus freed from solving organizational issues in order to give them time to conduct \\"general\\", \\"mini-conversations\\" and for informal communication with the participants of the festival. Such communication is one of the tasks of the organizers. In 2011, the Bishop Jonah (Cherepanov) noted: \\"Many young people who came to the festival practically have no opportunity to talk with priests at home. <...> People who have been going to church for many years, have been participating in the Sacraments for many years, cannot sit down and talk heart to heart with a priest? <...> Many provincial priests physically have no opportunity to pay attention to the young man, because they have a lot of demands, a lot of worshipers, a lot of duties on the temple. <...> For many of them, it was a revelation, so that easily, sitting next to the priest, to hear some things, to be able to ask questions\\". According to the priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev: \\"unfortunately, not very many fathers come, but those who are bright, not indifferent and ready to communicate with young people 24 hours a day come\\". In addition, the organizers are accustomed to the proposals of the participants of the festival: \\"Constantly there are those who give new ideas! For us, this impulse, what popular personalities to look for. There are priests <...> who have been actively working with young people for a long time, they come to us with pleasure. But some offer and little-known lecturers, priests. We listen to them on the Internet and invite. The guys like it and we are happy.\\" According to a long-term participant of the festival, Archpriest Nikolai Mogilny: \\"I really like the Christian love and friendship that arise between the priests who come to the festival. We become family people and every time you miss and wait for a meeting\\". There is a tradition at the festival as a token of approval to the priests to chant: \\"–û—Ç—Ü—ã-–º–æ–ª–æ–¥—Ü—ã!\\".  Accommodation in a tent camp at the summer festival  Supper. 2019 Summer Festival Participants of the summer festival live in tents, for which an open-air tent camp is organized.–õ–∞—Ä–∏—Å–∞ –ö–æ—Ä—è–∫–∏–Ω–∞ ¬´–ú—ã ‚Äî –±—Ä–∞—Ç—å—è¬ª // ¬´–ù–æ–≤–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å¬ª, ‚Ññ 60 (13191) –æ—Ç 9 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 2014 –≥–æ–¥–∞, —Å—Ç—Ä. 8-9 At the first festivals people who came together from one town or region, settled together. For convenience, organizers began to divide the tent city into sectors, and each sector received a name for the place from which its participants came.XII –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–π –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª—å ¬´–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—å—è¬ª ‚Äî –ï–û–£ –î–Æ–¶ –ü–ö ¬´–£–º–∏–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ¬ª Each sector is assigned a certain number of volunteers; throughout the festival they provide assistance to the participants living in their sector, voice them the plan for the next day and upcoming events, and are also responsible for maintaining order in their sector. Since the festival in 2014, the resettlement on the field did not take place by cities and communities, but in a mix at the discretion of the organizers. This was done in order to make friends or at least \\"to acquaint everyone and everything as much as possible\\". Sectors, starting from this festival, received names according to a certain concept conceived by the organizers of the festival; the choice of subject of names depends on the location of the festival and the general theme of a particular festival. Tents in which the participants live, they bring with them. In addition to the participants' tents, there should be a sleeping bag, sleeping pad and personal care. For a fee at the festival you can rent a tent, but in this case it is necessary to coordinate the issue with the organizers in advance, as the number of such tents is limited. Sleeping bags and pads are not available for rent. With the exception of couples is not allowed to stay guys and girls in the same tent. According to the long-term participant of the festival, Archpriest Nikolai Mogilny, living in a tent camp includes an element of austerity: \\"Often you need to be humbled, especially if there are two or three people in a tent: someone is sitting, wants to talk, and you want to sleep. In any case, this is an inner work on yourself. It is a struggle with your own egoism. It is clear that all this naturally moves a person to that feat, when love for one's neighbor wins in him. A field canteen is organized at the summer festival, where food is delivered from the nearest town. To protect it from rain, it is placed under an awning. In addition to the kitchen itself, awnings with benches and tables are placed. Three meals a day, included in the cost of participation at the festival. The menu is simple and undemanding, but satisfying. Drinking alcohol is strictly forbidden at the festival; violators are subject to immediate eviction. Smoking at the festival is allowed only in specially designated areas. For smokers, these participants became an incentive to quit smoking. At each summer festival, a stage and places for spectators are necessarily mounted, a camp church is built, a registration tent, washbasins, toilet and shower stalls are set up, playgrounds for sports competitions and games are arranged, litter bins. The campground is guarded. It is forbidden to arbitrarily leave the territory of the festival camp without the consent of the organizing committee. This is due both to the fact that the organizers are responsible for the safety of the participants, and to the fact that, according to Oksana Shashuto, \\"if you leave for a day, for half a day, you drop out of it, this is not very advisable\\". Organizers urge to carefully consider the choice of clothing for the festival. In case of rain, it is recommended to take a raincoat, rubber boots–°—Ç–µ–Ω–∞ and warm clothes may be required. It can be hot during the day at the festival field, and cold at night.  Hotel accommodation at the winter festival  The participants of the winter festival live in the hotel complex, the cost of accommodation and meals is included in the fee. In the case of the 2015 Winter Festival in the Holy Land 2015 and the 2018 Winter Festival in Cyprus, the price included the price of air tickets, medical insurance and transfer to the hotel. And although the organizers are trying to choose budget hotels, the price of the winter festival is noticeably higher than the summer one. This makes winter festivals less financially affordable and less crowded. About 150 people usually come to them (see the section Festivals held). According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"It's quite a closed winter festival of this kind, where you can get to know each and every one by the name of almost a week\\". In winter, a temporary church is not built, but existing ones are used. The presence of such a temple nearby is one of the important criteria when choosing a hotel. The scene is also not built, but the assembly hall of the hotel is used, or it is rented separately. Unlike the summer festival, at which, with the exception of the procession and the excursion day, all the participants' activities are focused on the festival field, at the winter festival the organizers do not seek to close themselves exclusively in the hotel complex and often arrange trips or hikes. Excursion and pilgrimage days are appointed, when participants go out by bus in the morning for a trip, during which they visit several places, and return from it by the evening. While the program of summer festivals does not change significantly from year to year, winter festivals may differ significantly from each other.

It's like a prayer. Why do we return to prayer, because we are well, we communicate with the Heavenly Father. The festival is also the joy of meeting, the joy of socializing\\". According to Bishop Jonah (Cherepanov): \\"The festival pleases with its informality and lack of protocol. Not indifferent people, by working, give the opportunity to enjoy other indifferent people\\". As noted on the pravoslavie.ru website: \\"The Festival \\"Bratya\\" is, first of all, a spiritual community, sincere help to one's neighbor, a creative approach to the realization of life tasks, a wide range of opportunities for the effective self-realization of young people, the development of their creative and spiritual potential, and - a unique opportunity to meet talented, interesting people and tell yourself about yourself, your achievements and hopes\\". As Yana Sedova noted: \\"mutual aid is a necessary condition for life on the \\"Bratya\\". The overwhelming majority of participants are urban dwellers, not everyone has a tourist experience. Finally, you will not take everything you need from home; you will forget something anyway. Therefore, participants try to come to each other for help. You spilled compote? Take the second one! You can not catch up with the procession? Lean on my arm! You come to the festival without a headscarf? I have an extra one! Dozens of such trifles have remained in my memory, which together constitute a unique friendly atmosphere\\". According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"The state of helping one another, when someone is cold, someone drowns, someone swam away, someone needs to be saved, it gives a lot. If now there was just prosperity, they would not have been worried about each other and, perhaps, would not have been introduced to each other in such numbers\\". As noted by the participants of the Penza-based Orthodox youth association \\"Voskreseniye\\" in 2014, despite the rich program \\"the festival was truly Orthodox. And now it is not only about the daily Liturgies, the morning and evening prayer rules, which can be unusual for unchurched people; not even about pilgrimages to such famous places as Optina Pustyn or Sergiev Posad. It was a difficult verbal culture of behavior. Having got there from the ordinary world, as if you find yourself in <...> the place where the germs of the Orthodox faith in each of us are protected, healed and fed <...> And this is also an inspiration from the realization that you have many like-minded people, brothers and sisters in Christ. And the belief that with our work and God's help, we can make this world kinder and brighter\\". As Olga Lazar noted, the organizers strive that young people, after leaving the festival, to share their knowledge, to introduce \\"that bright feeling that was created at the festival into their daily life\\".  Program  Schedule of events for the current and next day. Summer festival 2018. Already the program of the very first festival was written in such a way that each festival day was strictly scheduled and eventful. This continued in the future. Maria Evsina described the standard program of the festival day of the summer festival in such a way: \\"Every day \\"Bratya\\" was full and was filled with various kinds of events. In the morning, the participants woke up to the Divine Liturgy, then they cheered on their exercises, had breakfast and dispersed in mini-conversations or general lectures on spiritual topics, during which everyone could safely ask his questions. <...> In the evenings, concerts were held at which everyone who wished to attend the festival showed their talents <...> Sometimes, after concerts, anyone could sing songs around a campfire with a guitar or get a sector to talk to a candle\\". Although participants are given the freedom to choose to attend most events, the festival implies an understanding of its objectives and active involvement by the participants, rather than an idle pastime. According to the priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev: \\"Everything happens very dynamically, the guys are loaded with classes. We try to find approaches that would be interesting spiritually and physically. To miss and be sad there is not necessary. Many complain that there is no free time to just talk\\".  Check in and open Volunteers come first to the festival to prepare the surrounding area for the festival and set up temporary buildings and tents necessary for it. Starting in 2010, the arrival of the majority of participants at the summer festival begins on Saturday from noon. On this day, they are usually met at the station, train or bus station by volunteers who help them get to the festival field. For this most often hired buses. Participants who arrive before or after the date of official arrival will travel independently. For those who will come by themselves a location map is attached on festival website Baggage of those who have already arrived, but have not yet settled.

After that, in agreement with the volunteers, they set up their tents in the field reserved for them. On the same day, after the arrival of the main part of the sector, volunteers lead the game to meet the participants of the sector. At about 8:00 pm ‚Äì 9:00 pm on the same day, the first concert performance begins. Itis the \\"presentation of cities\\" (), where participants from one place get together and perform a stage presentation of their city, town or region in an arbitrary creative form, usually in the form of kapustnik. The duration of one speech should not exceed 5 minutes. The submission of cities first appeared at the 2007 summer festival instead of the grand opening of the festival, which was postponed to the evening following the arrival of the day.—Å–º. –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥—ë–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–µ—Å—Ç–∏–≤–∞–ª–µ–π –Ω–∞ –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ Due to the smaller number of participants and festival days, the winter festival usually dispenses with the representation of cities. The next morning after the arrival is a prayer service for receiving a petition and for all the blessings of God, and in the evening of the same day, at about 8:00 pm, the grand opening of the festival begins, to which representatives of local authorities are traditionally invited. The first song that sounds at this concert is the festival anthem in the form of a song, the peculiarity of which is that in one way or another the word \\"brothers\\" is played up in it. The hymn is composed only for the summer festival, so the number of hymns coincides with the age of the festival.  Worship and common prayers  Divine Liturgy in the camp church. 2017 Summer festival. During the preparation of the first festival, it was decided that each day would begin and end with a prayer. Daily at the festival morning and evening prayers are read according to the prayer book. According to Victoria Anikeeva, \\"no one forces participants to read it, a microphone is put to which those guys who are ready to read out loud approach, and everyone else is praying side by side\\". The Divine Liturgy is celebrated almost every morning in the camp church, which is being built at the festival field. The church itself is small and can hold an altar, and the laity pray before it. A temporary temple is intentionally done without walls, so the worshipers see everything that the priests do. According to Yana Sedova, the festival liturgy \\"is always with a missionary touch. The absence of an iconostasis allows you to see everything that happens in altar, and aloud reading of secret prayers by many priests immerses stronger to the essence of the Sacrament\\". Singers for the choir are recruited from young people who came to the festival and have experience singing in the choir. Liturgy is not served as a rule on the day of arrival, on the day of pilgrim trips and the morning after the night liturgy. Once, near the end of the festival, night worship is celebrated, which begins at 21.00 with the reading of the canons and rules for the Communion, and since the festival is used to confess before communion, the clergy at this time accept the confession from those tho not have time to confess earlier. At 23.00 the Vespers begin, and after Orthros was celebrated, during which practically all the participants of the festival take communion. According to Oksana Shashauto: \\"We followed in the footsteps of the first Christians, when services were held in the evening and at evening and night to hide from the persecutors. Now, in most temples, night liturgies are performed traditionally on Easter and Christmas. And then we prayed right under the open sky, under the stars. It was an amazing feeling.\\" Many participants call night worship the culmination of the festival. As Maria Evsina noted: \\"The night service in \\"Bratya\\" is a little Easter. I felt the transmitted joy and grace, seeing around me friendly participants with candles in their hands, united by this holiday. The service was literally in one breath, in concentrated silence and solemn singing. And finally, the Communion. And after him - joyful fraternal embrace and congratulations. Christ is Risen! Truly Risen!\\".  Campfire  Evening campfire. 2010 summer festival Every evening at the summer festival a campfire is lit, where any participant of the festival can come. Evenings around the campfire were conceived in preparation for the first festival; thus, the portal \\"Slovo\\" noted in a note about the preparation of the first festival: \\"Life in tents, songs, conversations around the evening fire, are intended not only to fill the festival meetings with romance, but also to rally Orthodox youth\\". At the \\"Campfire\\" it is customary to sing songs, usually with an acoustic guitar, as well as talk. In addition, it may become cold in the evening, and then the fire is used as a means of heating. As Olga Lazar wrote in 2014, \\"in the evenings, everyone gathers a huge and friendly campfire. We sing songs together, play together, it's hard only to go to sleep. Volunteers, as they can, try to disperse everyone, because the next day there are a lot of activities, it is better to be vigorous for them\\". In addition to informal gatherings around the campfire outside the main program, the program of the very first festival included such an event as \\"Campfire and Songs\\".http://bratia.ru/Programma%202005.doc The purpose of such an event is to familiarize participants with each other. If on the day of arrival the participants get acquainted by sectors, then on the second day of the festival, after the official opening ceremony, the program includes a \\"Campfire\\" where participants from different sectors can meet. After the closing ceremony of the festival according to the schedule should be \\"farewell campfire\\", where you can sit until the morning.  \\"General conversations\\" and \\"mini-conversations\\"  Priest Roman Andrienko conducts a mini- conversation. 2017 summer festival. The lectures are built in the format of \\"general conversation\\" () and \\"mini-conversation\\" (), and not only listening to the lecture, but also asking the listeners questions. As noted in the Moscow Diocesan Gazette, \\"the fathers help find answers to many questions, and sometimes, on the contrary, think and ask themselves a question: do I live, do I do the right thing?\\". Conversations can be conducted not only by priests and bishops, but also by well-versed laypeople. These activities are held in the morning and in the daytime. A general conversation is usually held once a day, and all participants of the festival are invited to it. The name of the speaker is announced in advance in the festival program. Mini-conversations begin with the fact that all the participants of the festival approach the festival scene, where volunteers go up with signs in their hands. On the plates are written the names of mini conversations, of which each participant chooses the closest topic to him. When choosing a topic, participants not know exactly who will lead the mini-conversation. After the festival participants choose a topic, volunteers take them to the place where the selected \\"mini- conversation\\" will take place. Mini-conversations are held simultaneously, so at one moment you can attend only one mini-conversation. The number of mini- talks is different each time and depends on the number of participants in the festival and on the number of priests who are ready to lead them. According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"Everyone diverges in such small groups. And, it turns out, there is an opportunity to talk face to face, <...> people 20, 10 - a conversation with a particular priest on a specific topic. Well, these conversations, even though they are mini, they should end in one hour, they more and more often begin to reach out and not end, because no one can disperse\\". As Yulia Voskoboinikova noted, \\"the free format of such conversations practically \\"ate\\" the distance between the shepherds and the flock, which helped both those and others to better see and understand each other. Indeed, it is difficult to maintain a rigid chain of command, sitting side by side on the grass\\". Topics of conversations can be very different, including those not directly connected with the Church. Traditionally popular are topics related to family life and the search for a life partner. The only restriction imposed on such conversations is not to talk about politics \\"in any manifestations\\".  Festival performances and creativity  Every day musical and theatrical performances take place on the improvised stage of the festival;–¢–∞–∏—Å–∏—è –°–∞–∫–æ–≤–∏—á ¬´–ö–∞–∫ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ, —á—Ç–æ –º—ã –¥—Ä—É–≥ —É –¥—Ä—É–≥–∞ –µ—Å—Ç—å!¬ª // ¬´–ü–∞–Ω—Ç–µ–ª–µ–∏–º–æ–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç¬ª, ‚Ññ 11/124, —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—å 2009, —Å—Ç—Ä. 3 as a rule, they are held in the evening after the lectures, which are held in the morning and afternoon.

On the festival stage, singing with a guitar or sometimes a cappella, purely instrumental performances, dances, and artistic reading can occur. The music from the scene is not limited to any one genre. It can be folk songs and church singing¬´–Æ–∂–Ω—ã–π –≥–ª–∞—Å –≤ –ú–æ–∂–∞–π—Å–∫–µ¬ª // ¬´–ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ –ü—Ä–∏–¥–Ω–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—å–µ¬ª // —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—å 15 (200) 2006, —Å—Ç—Ä. 3 and author song and rock and pop music and even rap. The general direction is not a genre, but rather the life-affirming direction of these performances; Concerts at the festival, according to Oksana Shashuto, are \\"warm, kind, friendly\\". Soulful acts coexist with humorous ones. The organizers do not seek to invite famous artists. The peculiarity of the festival is that any participant can perform on stage a musical or some other act after passing the audition, that provides by volunteers. Priests, who come to the festival, also may sing on the festival scene. According to Oksana Shashuto, the stage performances do not provide for contests, \\"there is no competition, there is no such thing that people come and tremble, what place they will take and are ready to win everybody. <...> We therefore tried to do everything very informally and very unformattedly\\". At each festival, the priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev performs a guitar with an acoustic guitar with his own songs. The dance performances of Oksana Shashuto's dance studio are traditional, including the girl act \\"Mozhaisk Hares\\" (), in which they put white cardboard ears on their heads and move with a rapidly reproduced phonogram, which gives the performance is an additional comic effect. There is a tradition to arrange spontaneous horovods or run in chains around the stage during the performance of songs: \\"standing among the spectators during a concert, you suddenly, caught up by someone's hand, swept away in a swirling rush, becoming part of a huge round dance\\". In addition, there is a tradition at the festival to sing songs not only during performances on the stage and rehearsals, but also in any free time. As Maria Evsina wrote about the 2017 winter festival: \\"We sang everywhere and always! On the train back and forth in the brotherly carriage they constantly gathered with the guitar. Nightly meetings were good the same. You come all exhausted at 12 at night in the room after a busy day, and your name is to tea, sing songs with a guitar. I forgot about the dream for a week! Any concert, whether it was the opening, closing or performance of Father Yaroslav and the Orthodox ensemble \\"Kazachenka\\" from Astrakhan, was accompanied by singing. On any road (both on foot and on buses), someone started and the rest picked up\\".  \\"Angels\\"  In the first days of the festival, its participants pull out a piece of paper with the name of their \\"ward\\", about which, without opening his name, he must take care, pray, give presents, that is, be his \\"angel\\". But before this \\"ward\\" you need to find among the participants of the festival. In the community of the festival on the social network Vkontakte it was noted: \\"Gifts should not be expensive and not necessarily they should be gifts - sometimes attention and a smile are more pleasant and necessary\\".–°—Ç–µ–Ω–∞ For example, in 2011, the \\"angels\\" play looked like this: \\"while the festival was going, your task was to create good for your ward. And in this, everyone was who was ready for something - someone passed through others to his ward gifts bought in advance, icons, bouquets, freshly picked from wildflowers, lemonade, which was so useful on a hot summer day and sweets bought along the way from the procession. But it was possible in the morning to find the birch donated by the Angel to his ward, as the fresh inscription on it and even the fish in the river, loudly called an aquarium, with a written request not to catch these fish, were announced, as they were donated to such a ward by Angel. Well, such amenities as, for example, a song as a gift - the singers sent from Angel surrounded the ward and gave him a song\\". At the end of the festival, the \\"Angels\\" are revealed at the command of the organizers, and at the same time they become acquainted with both the \\"angel\\" and the ward. Started dating often turns into friendship.  Pilgrimages, excursions and processions  The procession to Lahoysk. 2010 Summer festival Not a single festival \\"Bratya\\" is complete without a visit to Eastern Orthodox shrines located near its venues. On one of the days at the summer festival, a festival-wide procession takes place to a particular church or monastery, where after that all those who come participate in the service, and then return. As Taisia Sakovich wrote in 2009: \\"Imagine yourself: a column of 700 people is walking, occupying the entire right lane, and giving a prayer chants in a friendly choir! Cars were passing by. The surprised faces of the people accompanied us. It turns out that the church is not only silent standing with bowed head and not only grandmothers! It is also a living youth\\". In addition, the summer festival program necessarily highlights the excursion day, when festival participants take buses and drive around on predetermined routes, and return to the festival venue in the evening. Everyone chooses their route in advance, when registering for the festival. According to Oksana Shashuto: \\"when we come to another city, we try to set aside a separate day for pilgrimage excursions to see those shrines, those cities, those beauties that are located there, which we generally have never seen and hardly would have seen if they hadn't come there. Therefore, <...> 6-7 variants of excursions are usually thought out by local guys. And in one day, all buses depart for different points of the region, the diocese\\". In this case, tours are not necessarily organized to churches or monasteries. It can be museums or natural or architectural monuments.http://astreparh.ru/novosti-eparhii/2522-pravoslavnyy-molodezhnyy- festival-bratya-v-astrahani.html As the participants get up early on the excursion, the morning rule is already read on the bus.  Sports and other competitions  Sport competition. 2008 summer festival. Already at the first festival sports competitions in football and volleyball were provided; In the future, it was these games that were most often played at summer festivals. This gives festival participants the opportunity to show their strength, dexterity and skills.

In winter, the festival can be skis, snowballs, skates, etc. Since 2006, the role-playing game in the form of a quest. To win, participants need to show not only quick thinking, but also quickness and agility. Since the summer festival of 2014, a vigorous morning exercise is held, allowing participants to cheer up after they woke up. At the summer festival of 2013, it was said: \\"Sport is life, a healthy mind in a healthy body, in a person who has the strength and desire to win, the soul always lives, capable of winning, including winning their fears and doubts, being able to endlessly diligently approach God. Sport is a school of life, where one fact is evident: \\"right away\\" and \\"quickly\\" nothing happens, including the development of spiritual balance\\".–ú–∏–Ω–∏–æ—Ç—á–µ—Ç—ã —Å –º–∏–Ω–∏–±–µ—Å–µ–¥ // ¬´–ë—Ä–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫¬ª ‚Ññ 3 (23 –∏—é–ª—è 2013, –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫) At the festival of 2006, a mini-football championship was held between the national teams of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and the priests who came to the festival: \\"Everything here was like real football: fans actively waving national flags, chanting recitatives of their national teams\\". At the summer festival of 2007, a comic festival Olympiad in support of the Sochi 2014 Olympics was held, which was held as follows: \\"All were divided into teams for the same badges on the badges <...> We had to pass 15 tests - all were made by analogy with the real Olympic competitions - and winter. <...> it was an exciting action - the teams made up names for themselves, chants. All sought to do conscientiously !! \\"A lot was important for participation, but for some it was VICTORY - they achieved it\\". Representatives of the Foundation \\"Warriors of the Fatherland\\", who visited the summer festival of 2015, noted the interest of its participants in tactical training and stated the inconsistency of the ideas about \\"the predisposition of Orthodox youth exclusively to a contemplative lifestyle, some detachment from it or a passive life position\\"..

Master classes are most often not invited to conduct a specific master class, but participants who come to the festival who share their skills. A participant who wants to conduct a master class agrees with the organizers in advance.–°—Ç–µ–Ω–∞ Like mini-conversations, festival participants are offered plates with the names of master classes, which are held simultaneously.

The beginning of the ball at the summer festival of 2014 was described as follows: \\"Our whole tent camp changed in an instant.

Also at the final concert, letters of appreciation and similar awards are given to those who have particularly laboured to conduct this festival. Then a \\"farewell campfire\\" passes, after which (or instead of) the participants go to sleep. The next morning, the liturgy is served and after lunch, at about noon, the next festival is presented, the venue of which has traditionally been kept secret before. Initially, the closing ceremony was the most recent festival event, followed by a departure of participants. At the summer festival in 2008, the closing ceremony was held on the evening of the penultimate day, and since 2009, the current order has been established. After that, the participants of the festival say goodbye to each other and go home. Some participants of the festival immediately after the end of the festival \\"just go to visit each other so as not to part for at least a few more days\\". After the participants leave, the volunteers dismantle temporary buildings, clean the garbage and leave themselves.  Festival Community and Projects   Communication outside the festival  Acquaintances, which are started at the festival, often maintain after it. Festival participants communicate via the Internet, arrange local meetings, visit each other. As Yana Sedova noted: \\"Bratya is more than a festival.

In addition, according to the priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev: \\"We strive <...> to organize such a place that the Brothers Festival was there all year round <...> This is a spiritual and cultural center that young people can take year-round, and where the entire infrastructure would be. That is, there is a temple for the celebration of the Eucharist, and there is a concert hall <...>, an open area for summer, a tent camp, a building where you can be accommodated in winter\\".  Fraternal trips  Even before the creation of the festival \\"Brothers\\" Orthodox youth group from Mozhaisk began to travel to Kyiv, where including met the first week of lent in the St. Jonah monastery. Since those who visited the festival wanted to meet more often, a winter festival was invented, \\"and then the volunteers began to celebrate the new year together, and then we organized inter-fraternal meetings. And trips began: together to Bari, together to Corfu, to France to the Shroud of Turin, to Italy\\".. According to the priest Yaroslav Yerofeyev: \\"Travels broaden horizons, erase many stereotypes about countries and people, give the opportunity to stay with relatives in spirit people in isolation from everyday worries. I try to participate in pilgrimage trips to touch our sacred Christian Tradition, which is preserved in the relics of God's saints, and in the bricks of ancient sanctuaries. And what is important: we always invite to our group only interesting and highly qualified guides!¬ªhttp://edem.bratia.ru/#poezdki  School of Volunteers  At the 2016 summer festival in Zaslavl, the team of volunteers did not work out. As a result, it was decided to train volunteers seriously, for which the \\"school of volunteers of the festival \\"Bryatya\\" was invented. Work on its creation began after the end of the 2017 winter festival. Victoria Anikeeva and Marina Zhironkina undertook the main work of its creation. Formulated goals and objectives of the \\"School of volunteers\\", clearly formulated requirements to the volunteer festival \\"Brothers\\", created a group in social network \\"Vkontakte\\", which was regularly replenished. All disciplines in the \\"School of volunteers\\" were divided into 4 blocks (according to the number of teachers): spiritual (priest Yaroslav Erofeev), practical (Oksana Shashuto), psychological (Marina Zhironkina), game (Victoria Anikeeva). The goal of the volunteer school was not only to give knowledge to its students, but also to unite them into a single team, \\"immerse them in the atmosphere of the festival, help everyone to tune in to the upcoming hard selfless work, learn to survive in difficult conditions\\". For the first time, the \\"School of volunteers\\" was held from 9 to 14 July 2017 at the Borodino field, just before the festival held there. In the future, the \\"School of volunteers\\" came during the 7 days immediately before the festival. In addition to studying at the \\"School of volunteers\\" its students had to study and deal with the device of the festival camp. On the last day of the \\"School...\\" a \\"trust trail\\" was held, which was a series of tests aimed at ensuring that volunteers unconditionally trusted and came to the aid of each other if needed. The peculiarity of the \\"volunteer School\\" was that those who successfully trained, immediately put on a red t-shirt and began to practice. In the future, the \\"School of volunteers\\" came annually during the week immediately before the summer festival. Upon completion of the training participants receive certificates of the Synodal Department for youth Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church on passing the School of volunteers.  Orthodox psychological workshop  In September 2017, it was announced that the \\"Orthodox Psychological Workshop\\" was organized by the volunteer of the festival \\"Brothers\\" and one of the creators of the \\"School of the Volunteer\\" psychologist Marina Zhironkina. The first \\"workshop\\" was held from 4 to 6 November in Mozhaisk 2017. The program included lectures, trainings, master classes, psychological film club, playback theatre, drawing in the style of \\"neurography\\"http://naslednick.online/events/uchastvuy/takepart_1127.html. After that, the \\"Workshop\\" was held twice a year, in spring and autumn.  Bratya - Family  Due to the fact that many participants of the festival \\"grew up, got married, had children, acquire family and friends, but the desire to get together has not dried up\\", as well as \\"the range of issues and interests has changed significantly\\"http://7ya.bratia.ru/#venue, the organizers decided that \\"the Festival should grow with everyone\\" and announced on March 25, 2018 the first family festival \\"Bratya\\", created specifically for married couple with children and in March 2018 it was announced about the holding of the first family festival \\"Bratya\\", created specifically for couples with children, which was held from September 29 to October 6, 2018 on Corfu Island.. Since then it has been held annually in autumn in the Mediterranea. The program includes: conversations and discussions; \\"fathers and mothers of the festival\\"; advice on medicine, pregnancy and childbirth, family education, child rearing; \\"Warm-up-dance minutes\\"; excursions to shrines and beautiful places; games, quests, quiz and \\"fun and interesting movement\\", swimming in the seahttp://7ya.bratia.ru/#timings.  \\"Fraternal mail\\"  In March 2018, the campaign was held for the first time on mailing among participants of Easter cards using the postcrossing system. Each participant filled in the form, indicated his exact address. After that, the organizers sent 5 addresses to personal messages to each enroller, after which he had to prepare and send colorful cards to these addresses, and then receive 5 cards from five different addresses. The action was repeated before Christmas, in connection with which the website was announced on November 3 of the same year the domain post.bratia.ru was announced. Since then mailing occurs twice a year: before Easter and before Christmas. According to the organizers: \\"the festival can not stop and carries its joy on, around! New projects are being created, new ideas are being implemented... One of them is the idea to join the fraternal world with each piece ‚Äî a postcard, signed with his own hand, with the text coming from the heart, with a small gift, bearing the fragrance of his soul donor...

Alcoholism is a known problem on the continent, and has led to fights and indecent exposure. Other types of crimes that have occurred in Antarctica include illicit drug use, torturing and killing wildlife, racing motorbikes through environmentally sensitive areas, assault with a deadly weapon, attempted murder, and arson. Sexual harassment also has been reported. Robberies are highly unusual in Antarctica because the people cannot bring very much onto the continent. Also very little use for money exists in Antarctica. Under the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, ratified by 53 nations, persons accused of a crime in Antarctica are subject to punishment by their own country.  National laws applying to crimes in Antarctica   South Africa  South African citizens in Antarctica are subject to South African law under the South African Citizens in Antarctica Act, 1962. Under the act, Antarctica is deemed to be within the jurisdiction of the magistrate's court at Cape Town.  United Kingdom  Section 5 of the Antarctic Treaty Act 1967 extends the laws of every part of the United Kingdom to members and observers of British Antarctic expeditions. Law applying certain wildlife crimes is extended to all British citizens by section 1.  United States  The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (enacted October 12, 1984) covers crimes committed by Americans or crimes committed against Americans. Any American who is outside of the United States, but not in another country, is still subject to certain U.S. laws. All Americans committing a crime, and any foreigner committing a crime against an American outside of a sovereign state, are subject to prosecution in a U.S. federal court. This includes international waters and Antarctica. Although nations claim territory in Antarctica, the United States does not recognize these claims. Examples of crimes covered by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 include murder, maiming, rape, arson, treason, and bribing a federal official. List of crimes in Antarctica 1959 ‚Äì The Vostok Station (—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—è –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫), then a Soviet research station in Princess Elizabeth Land, was the scene of a fight between two scientists over a game of chess. When one of them lost the game, he became so enraged that he attacked the other with an ice axe. According to some sources, it was a murder, though other sources say that the attack was not fatal. Afterwards, chess games were banned at Soviet/Russian Antarctic stations. October 1981 ‚Äì Arson was attempted at the Chapel of the Snows at McMurdo Station, an American research station at the McMurdo Sound. A winter-over crew person who was intoxicated set fire to the chapel late one night in order to be sent home early. Someone noticed smoke coming from the chapel and reported it to the fire house. The person who reported it went inside and pulled some of the pews away from the fire. Shortly thereafter, a friend arrived, and they both pulled the burning carpet out the door before the firefighters arrived. Because quick action was taken, damage was not significant and was repaired that coming summer. 12 April 1984 ‚Äì The Almirante Brown Station (Estaci√≥n Cient√≠fica Almirante Brown) is an Argentine research station located on the Coughtrey Peninsula by Paradise Harbor. The station's original facilities were burned down by the station's leader and doctor on 12 April 1984 after he was ordered to stay for the winter. The station personnel were rescued by the ship Hero and taken to Palmer Station, an American research station on Anvers Island. The stations are about 58 km (36 mi) apart by air. 9 October 1996 ‚Äì At McMurdo Station, a fight occurred between two workers in the kitchen. One worker attacked the other with a hammer. Another cook tried to break up the fight and was also injured. The two victims were Tony Beyer and Joe Stermer. Both of them required stitches. FBI agents from the United States were sent to McMurdo Station to investigate and make an arrest. The suspect was flown to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he faced charges of four counts of assault with a dangerous weapon. He pleaded not guilty. No further information was publicly available. 11 May 2000 ‚Äì On 11 May 2000, at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, an American research station located at the South Pole, Australian astrophysicist Rodney Marks had a fever, stomach pains, and nausea. On May 12, he died. It was believed at the time that Marks died of natural causes. It was the onset of winter, so his body could not be transported for six months. His body was put into a freezer at the observatory. After the six months were over, Marks' body was flown to Christchurch, New Zealand, for an autopsy. The autopsy concluded that he had died from methanol poisoning. How the poisoning occurred remains a mystery. 9 October 2018 ‚Äì On 9 October 2018, a stabbing occurred at the Bellingshausen Station (—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—è –ë–µ–ª–ª–∏–Ω—Å–≥–∞—É–∑–µ–Ω), a Russian research station on King George Island. The perpetrator was Sergey Savitsky (–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –°–∞–≤–∏—Ü–∫–∏–π), a 54-year-old electrical engineer. He stabbed Oleg Beloguzov (–û–ª–µ–≥ –ë–µ–ª–æ–≥—É–∑–æ–≤), a 52-year old welder, in the chest multiple times. According to some sources, the attack occurred because Beloguzov was giving away the endings of books that Savitsky checked out at the station's library. Other sources say that the attack occurred in the dining room when Beloguzov teased Savitsky by telling him that he should dance on top of the table to make money. Both accounts say that Savitsky was believed to be intoxicated at the time of the attack. They had worked together at the station for about six months, and Savitsky was apparently having an emotional breakdown. Being in a confined space may have been a major cause for this. Both Beloguzov and Savitsky had had problems with each other for several months. Beloguzov was sent to a hospital in Chile. Savitsky surrendered to the manager of the station, and 11 days later was placed on a flight back to Russia, where he was placed on house arrest until December 8 or 9. On 8 February 2019, Savitsky was at a preliminary hearing at the Vasileostrov District Court of Saint Petersburg. Savitsky was remorseful and was willing to accept a criminal punishment rather than rehabilitation. Beloguzov was forgiving of Savitsky and proposed dropping the case. The public prosecutor was supportive of Beloguzov's proposal, and noted that Savitsky was remorseful and had no prior criminal record. Judge Anatoly Kovin decided to drop the case.

During his career, he made over 70 appearances in the Football League during spells with Cardiff City, Middlesbrough and Newport County. Career Born in Bridgend, Hillier was working as a butcher while playing for local amateur side Bridgend Town when he was offered a trial with Football League side Swansea Town. He was retained by the club as an amateur for the 1926‚Äì27 season but never played for the first team. The following year, he signed for Swansea's local rivals Cardiff City. After impressing for the club's reserve side, he made his professional debut in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Everton in December 1927. He made four further appearances during the season and another four the following season as he acted as understudy to first choice goalkeeper Tom Farquharson. In January 1930, he was allowed to join Middlesbrough in a triple transfer with teammates John Jennings and Fred Warren. As part of the deal, Cardiff agreed to a clause that would see the club receive a further ¬£250 if both Hillier and Jennings played in twenty league matches for Middlesbrough. When both players reached the tally in May 1933, Cardiff issued a request for the money to be paid but received a cheque for just ¬£50. When Cardiff queried the payment, Middlesbrough produced the agreement paper which included only a bonus of ¬£50, an error that was later revealed to have been made by former Cardiff manager Fred Stewart who had mistakenly written the wrong figure. Cardiff appealed to the Football League, but their claim was dismissed. Hillier went on to make 63 league appearances for Middlesbrough before finishing his professional career with Newport County. Later life After retiring from football, Hillier retired to the town of Gosport where he became a publican. His son Barrie was also a professional footballer, playing nine league matches for Southampton during the 1957‚Äì58 season.

It was written in 1776-1777 and premiered in Paris on March 16, 1778. Composition Recent scholarship has suggested that the original inspiration for the story, though not its setting, was an account of the death of a young woman in China who prayed for death rather than betrayal of her faith. At the time he was working on the early versions of the play, Voltaire was reading M√©moires concernant l‚Äôhistoire, les sciences, les arts, les m≈ìurs, les usages, etc., des Chinois by the Jesuit priest Jean Joseph Marie Amiot and corresponding with d'Alembert and Diderot about what he read. The theme of a woman who chooses death before disloyalty is also classically Confucian. The play was written as part of Voltaire's plan to make a triumphal return to Paris after having spent nearly twenty years in self-imposed exile in Ferney. He wished to end his life with a great theatrical success that would secure his position for posterity and prevent his enemies from taking any action against him. He therefore set about writing a classical tragedy that would affirm his reputation and enable his return to the centre of French cultural life. To this end, in the early part of 1777, Voltaire was working on two plays at the same time; one was Ir√®ne and the other was Agathocle. Correspondence with his friend d'Argental indicated that he was initially unsure which would be more successful; he gradually came to consider that Ir√®ne would work better on stage, and it was indeed Ir√®ne that was rehearsed and performed while he was alive. Having previously sent him the manuscript of Agathocle, he wrote to d'Argental on 25 October ‚ÄòI'm sending you something (Ir√®ne) more passionate, more theatrical, and more interesting.' The original working title for Ir√®ne was Alexis Comn√®ne and it was only in a later revision that the title and the focus of the plot was changed to the heroine. The action is very loosely based in the historical setting of the overthrowing of the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates by Alexios I Komnenos in the year 1081. Voltaire also wrote a letter to the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, which he prefaced to the tragedy. In this letter he emphasized the independence and importance of French poetry in relation to the English tradition in the wake of Shakespeare, referring to a debate launched by Louis-S√©bastien Mercier and Michel-Jean Sedaine. Action Jean-Michel Moreau: Illustration of Ir√®ne, 1786 Ir√®ne, compelled by her family to marry Nic√©phore, Emperor of Constantinople, loves the prince Alexis. Alexis, returning victorious from campaign to Constantinople against the will of the Emperor, wishes to declare his love to Ir√®ne, but Nic√©phore orders him to leave the city. Alexis refuses, so the Emperor orders his arrest and execution. Warned by his attach√© Memnon, Alexis and his army confront the emperor. Defeated by Alexis but spared, Nic√©phore is killed by the people. Alexis ascends the throne. As a widow, Ir√®ne is then obliged to enter a convent by her father L√©once. Ir√®ne renounces her love for Alexis at her father's insistence. Furious that L√©once will deprive him of his love, Alexis puts the father in chains. Ir√®ne appeals for his release and then kills herself, unable to reconcile the claims of love and duty. Voltaire himself remarked that people might think the play a comedy because 'people may laugh at a woman who takes her own life rather than sleep with the man who has conquered and murdered her husband, when she doesn't love the husband and absolutely adores the murderer.' He also commented that \\"I had great hopes when beginning the work, but at the end I see nothing but ridicule... nothing can undo the failings of a subject which does not exist in nature.' Performances The play was read through at Ferney on 23 October and first performed at Voltaire's private house theatre there for the wedding of the two of Voltaire's friends and prot√©g√©s, the Marquis de Villette and Reine Philiberte de Varicourt. Its public premiere was on March 16, 1778 by the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise at the Th√©√¢tre des Tuileries in Paris. The cast was Vanhove (Nic√©phore); (fr) Mol√© (Alexis Comn√®ne); (fr) Brizard (L√©once); Monvel (Memnon); Dusaulx (officier); Mme Vestris (Ir√®ne); Mlle Saint-Val cadette (Zo√©). Contemporary reception The crowning of Voltaire's bust after the sixth performance of Ir√®ne, 30 March 1778 Voltaire's appearance in Paris caused immense public excitement; he was hailed wherever he went and the success of his play was more a tribute to his public standing than to its artistic merits. The dress rehearsal on 14 March 1778 indicated that the play would not fail. The play opened on 16 March in the presence of Marie Antoinette, though Voltaire was too ill to attend; messengers were dispatched to him at the end of each act to report the audience's reception. For the sixth performance of the play on 21 March, the king's brother the comte d'Artois sent the captain of his guards to congratulate Voltaire, who then attended the performance in person. The audience shouted demands for him to be crowned, upon which one of the actors placed a wreath of laurels on his head. 'My God! Do you want to kill me with glory?' he exclaimed, weeping tears of joy. The play was performed twice that evening, and the actors then inaugurated a bust of Voltaire in the theatre, which they also crowned. After six further performances the play was taken off the stage. Printed versions Ir√®ne was printed posthumously in Paris in 1779, with another imprint in Lausanne. In neither case is the name of the printer known.

At the beginning, Moatti emphasises the obscurity of Rome's past, because Rome was \\"being destroyed and buried time and time again over centuries, its history has been obscured\\", and \\"the veil of legend has covered its ruins\\". During Medieval period, these ruins have exerted a real fascination as shown in the . In the Renaissance era, while Columbus was exploring the New World, artists, scholars, princes, adventurers and popes were searching through the soil of Rome for the remains of its former splendour.

Hope Dodds (2 January 1885 ‚Äì 13 May 1972) was an English author and historian who wrote The Pilgrimage of Grace 1536‚Äì1537, and the Exeter Conspiracy, 1538. She had three sisters and one brother, their parents were Edwin and Emily Dodds. She and two of her sisters founded the Little Theatre Gateshead.  Early life  Madeleine Hope Dodds was born to Edwin and Emily Bryham Dodds. She had three sisters and a brother. One of her grandfather's had a printing business and the other,John Mawson, was Sheriff of Newcastle. She went to a female-only high school called Gateshead High School. After she graduated high school in 1904, she attended Newnman College, Cambridge for two years. Dodds was able to pass within those two years with Second Class Honors in the History Tripos. Dodds was able to get her degree years later because at the time when she attended the college, females were not able to obtain any degree. Newnman College, Cambridge is still one of the few colleges that still give out education to exclusively females.  Writing career  Dodds began writing for the Victoria History of the Counties of England in 1907 contributing towards the history of Durham. Finding herself short of funds for her education she wrote to the publication's editor with the support of her tutor at Newnham. She offered to work more on Durham or on Northumberland. William Page agreed that she would join his staff and later she continued as an outworker being paid for every 1,000 words about Darlington. Dodds' college thesis on the bishops of Durham's boroughs gained her the Creighton memorial prize in 1909. In 1915, Madeleine Hope Dodds and her sibling, Ruth, wrote The Pilgrimage of Grace, 1536‚Äì1537, and the Exeter Conspiracy, 1538, which was published by the Cambridge University Press. Their work is still being recognised a century later. Their book appeared in The American Historical Review, which reviews historical pieces from 1895 to the present. Their work is well respected by scholars who are still alive to this day. Dodds was also featured in a book called, In Search of the New Woman: Middle-Class Women and Work in Britain 1870‚Äì1914, which briefly describes her work. Not only did she write The Pilgrimage of Grace, 1536-1537, and the Exeter Conspiracy, 1538 with her sister in 1915, she also wrote journals in her career, like \\"The Problem of the 'Ludus Coventriae'\\" and \\"Political Prophecies in the Reign of Henry VIII\\". The journals that Dodds have published can range from theatre and poetry to morality, religion and history. Dodds was also one of many who worked for the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries in 1908. In 1947 she was promoted to be an honorary member by the society that she worked for. Death and legacy Dodds died in 1972. There is a plaque to her and her elder sisters, Ruth and Sylvia, noting that they founded the Little Theatre Gateshead that was installed in 2005.

The only species with a similar structure is Pseudorhabdosynochus exoticoides Justine & Henry, 2010. Etymology According to the authors of the taxon, the species name is from Greek exotikos, ‚Äòfrom the outside, alien, foreign‚Äô to mark the strange structure of the vagina of this species. Hosts and localities The blue grouper, Epinephelus cyanopodus, is the host of P. exoticus The type-host and only recorded host of P. exoticus is the blue grouper Epinephelus cyanopodus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae). The type-locality and only recorded locality is off Noum√©a, New Caledonia. This grouper also harbours several other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, namely P. chauveti, P. cyanopodus, P. podocyanus, P. duitoe, and P. huitoe, and a diplectanid belonging to a different genus, Laticola cyanus. On the specimens of fish from off New Caledonia examined, P. exoticus represented 15% of the total number of monogeneans on the gills; 226 specimens were examined.

Her research was dedicated to understanding coral reef ecosystems, specifically coral-algal symbiosis and the capacity for corals to acclimatize under future climate change conditions. Doctor Gates is most accredited with looking at coral biology and human- assisted coral evolution, known as super corals, as notably seen in the documentary Chasing Coral, available on Netflix.  Education  Gates was inspired by the documentary The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. She studied biology at Newcastle University where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1984. She fell in love with corals during a diving trip to the West Indies. In 1985 she moved to the West Indies to study corals. She completed her PhD at Newcastle University in 1989 on seawater temperature and algal- cnidarian symbiosis. During her postgraduate work in Jamaica, she was exposed to the bleaching response of coral resulting from rising temperatures. Career and Research After her PhD, Gates was appointed a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. Here she spent thirteen years working as a junior researcher in California, developing skills in cellular biology, evolutionary biology, and molecular genetics. She was there during the 1998 bleaching event that killed more than 15% of corals across the world. Gates joined the Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology 2003. She studied corals and reefs, learning how they function and working on ways to slow their decline. She worked on Coconut Island, trying to identify why some corals survive bleaching. Her group monitored the ecosystems of coral reefs to understand how a changing environment impacted coral health. The corals in shallow patches like KƒÅne ªohe Bay are subject to high temperatures and irradiance. Alongside seawater temperature, they measure photosynthetic active radiation, salinity and nutrient composition. This allowed them to build 3D models of reefs. They study the symbiodinium that live within coral tissues. These provide the corals with energy and are lost during coral bleaching. They develop new techniques for data analysis and management, including developing EarthCube and CRESCYNT. Gates was concerned about sunscreen that contains octinoxate and oxybenzone, and in 2015 called for it to be banned in Hawaii. These sunscreens were banned in 2018. In 2012 she demonstrated that the choice of symbiotic algae was crucial for how tropical reefs survived environmental stresses. She predicted that more than 90 percent of the world's corals will be dead by 2050.  Gates Coral Lab  Gates established the Gates Coral Lab at the Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology. Even after the death of Ruth Gates in October 2018, her team continues on to conduct research centered around the biological traits of coral reef ecosystems. The team uses their research to inform restoration efforts and management policies.http://gatescorallab.com/research Significant contributions to coral reef research has been contributed by the Gates Coral Lab. The team works in collaboration with the Australian Institute of Marine Science on the Coral Assisted Evolution Project, which attempts to \\"stabilize and restore coral reefs\\" in the face of climate change.http://coralassistedevolution.com/ Gates' research team hosted the first coral restoration workshop in Hawaii at the Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology in 2017.Forsman ZH, Maurin P, Parry M, Chung A, Sartor C, Hixon MA, Hughes K, Rodgers K, Knapp ISS, Gulko DA, Franklin EC, Del Rio Torres L, Chan NT, Wolke CS, Gates RD, Toonen RJ (2018) The First Hawai‚Äòi Workshop For Coral Restoration & Nurseries.

Recent publications have discussed the necessity of focusing on local restoration and recovery efforts as opposed to mass scale restoration until there is more substantial research on how to best combat the root of the problem of bleaching events, climate change.

Drury C. (2020) Resilience in Reef- Building Corals: The ecological and evolutionary importance of the host response to thermal stress. Molecular Ecology  Super Coral  \\"Super corals\\" were defined as those that did not bleach during natural bleaching events when sea temperatures were high. Gates identified these so-called \\"super corals\\" as a potential mechanism for preventing coral extinction. Gates said, \\"I just cannot bear the idea that future generations may not experience a coral reef. The mission is to start solving the problem, not just to study it.\\" In 2013, she won the Paul G. Allen Ocean Challenge, a $10,000 prize that allowed her to improve the resilience of vulnerable coral reef ecosystems. For the proposal, Gates joined Madeleine van Oppen, and used genetic selection to boost resilience to environmental stress. They did this by exposing cross-bred corals to successively warmer and more acidic experimental tanks. In the laboratory, they took resistant corals and collected their reproductive products after spawning, raised their offspring in the lab, and tested for increased temperature resistance. Gates was awarded the University of Hawaii Board of Regents Medal for Excellence in Research. Coral Assisted Evolution, a $4 million research project, was funded by the Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group. This supported Gates' research for four years from 2016, developing super corals that can withstand climate change. Whilst Gates was concerned about playing with nature, she could not sit by and watch species become extinct without acting. In 2016, Gates was named by Hawaii Business as one of the top 20 leaders of Hawaii. She explored whether non-super corals could be encouraged to take on new symbionts to improve their ability to withstand high temperatures. If Gates' project is successful, it could save the US$9.9 trillion. In 2018, the foundation supported a coral reef map, that allowed scientists to monitor corals in unprecedented detail.  Public Engagement  In addition to her career in research, Gates served as a mentor, public speaker, science communicator, and proponent for change and progress in the field of marine science. She captivated and inspired audiences with her passion, optimism, and, as she modestly put it, her English boarding school accent. She was elected the first female president of the International Society for Reef Studies in 2015 and significantly increased membership and involvement while she served. The Super Coral proposals were featured in Fast Company, Gizmodo, PBS, Newsweek, Hawaii Business, National Geographic, the Huffington post, New Scientist and the BBC. Her work was featured in the Netflix documentary Chasing Coral. She was an invited speaker at the 2017 Aspen Ideas Festival. She was featured on the University of Hawai ªi Foundation video series in 2018. The Gates Coral Lab is involved in a wide range of public engagement and outreach, including hosting students from Mo'orea. She was a member of the Tetiaroa Society.  Chasing Coral  Gates' work at the Hawai ªi Institute of Marine Biology is featured in the captivating Netflix documentary, Chasing Coral. In the documentary, she explains her amazement with corals: \\"I have the utmost respect for corals because I think they have got us all fooled. Simplicity on the outside does not mean simplicity on the inside.\\" The documentary showcases her work with Richard Vevers and the rest of his diving team on a project to capture the process of coral bleaching in the wild for the first time. Gates provides the scientific foundation of knowledge for the conduction of this project, educating the team of divers and the audience of the film throughout. She warns the audience of the \\"eradication of an entire ecosystem in our lifespan\\" to encourage progress in the movement against climate change. Her appearance in Chasing Coral was one of Gates' several efforts of public outreach and engagement, working to raise awareness of coral bleaching and inspire the public to put a stop to these events.  Personal Life  Gates was born in Akrotiri, Cyprus, the sister of Timothy Gates and the daughter of John Amos Gates (RAF) and Muriel Peel Gates (physiotherapist). Her wife was Robin Burton-Gates, whom she married in September 2018. In her free time, she was an accomplished scuba diver, earned a black belt in karate, and started a school for karate in Hawaii. Gates was diagnosed with brain cancer at 56 years old,RIP Ruth Gates: The World Loses A Top Coral Scientist And ‚ÄòIndomitable Spirit‚Äô, Honolulu Civil Beat, October 30, 2018. but died from complications during a surgery for diverticulitis, unrelated to her former diagnosis.Ruth Gates, Who Made Saving Coral Reefs Her Mission, Is Dead at 56, The New York Times, November 5, 2018. Gates leaves a legacy of optimism and progress in the field of marine science: Van Oppen, the Gates Coral Lab, and multiple other labs across the globe, continue to study the mechanisms of resistance to climate change and how they may be passed down generations.

It was commissioned by the BBC and the National Brass Band Festival Committee in 1927 for the final of the 1928 National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain at Crystal Palace. The suite comprises three movements - Scherzo, Nocturne and March. Holst's biographer Michael Short notes that the suite features many of the hallmarks of the mature composer \\"from the skipping 6/8 of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of Saturn\\" [from The Planets suite]. Holst was himself a trombone player, and had already written works for military band, but this was his first and only work for brass band. The composer attended the competition and heard all 15 performances. The competition was won by the Black Dyke Mills Band conducted by William Halliwell, who also conducted several of the other bands that day. The composer was said to be delighted and wrote to the magazine The British Bandsman \\"Last Saturday I listened to musicians conducted by musicians\\". The composer also arranged the \\"Nocturne\\" for string orchestra. The success of the commission led to a number of new works for brass band by leading British composers of the day being commissioned for the Championship Section Final, many of them now staples of the genre, including Sir Edward Elgar's The Severn Suite (1930), John Ireland's A Downland Suite (1932) and Comedy Overture (1934), Granville Bantock's Prometheus Unbound (1933), Sir Arthur Bliss's suite Kenilworth (1936) and Herbert Howells' suite Pageantry (1937).

Playing career   2018 season  During the 2018 EU LS Season, Caps managed to win both the Spring and Summer Split with his then team, Fnatic. In both splits, he secured a spot on the 1st All-Pro Team. Additionally, he managed to win the title of most valuable player (MVP) in the Summer Split. At the 2018 World Championship, Fnatic was seeded into Group D alongside 100 Thieves, Invictus Gaming, and G-Rex. They picked up five wins in the group, allowing them to advance into the knockout stage of the tournament. In the quarterfinals, Fnatic defeated EDward Gaming by 3-1. Caps's performance on Azir and LeBlanc helped Fnatic win the semifinals against Cloud9 without losing a single game. After this they were swept 3-0 in the world final by their group rival Invictus Gaming.  2019 Season  Ahead of the 2019 season, Caps left Fnatic to join rival European organisation G2 Esports. G2 Esports dominated the Spring split in the newly rebranded League of Legends European Championship, going 13-5 during the regular season, with Caps winning MVP of the split. In combination with his MVP win during the 2018 EU LCS Summer Split, Caps became the first player ever to win back-to-back MVP titles on two different teams. G2 did not drop a single game in the playoffs, making them the first-ever winners of an LEC Split and granting them an immediate invite to the 2019 Mid Season Invitational. At the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational, G2 Esports defeated Team Liquid 3-0 in the finals as Caps was rewarded with the MVP of MSI 2019. This marked the first time a European team had won an international Tournament run by Riot Games since Fnatic had won the Season 1 World Championship, and the first time ever a non-asian team had won MSI. In the League of Legends European Summer Split 2019 the current MSI 2019 champions returned to dominate the Summer Split all the way to the end. Caps and G2 beat his old team Fnatic 3-2 in a best of five. This gave G2 eSports the first seed to represent Europe in the League of Legends Worlds Championship 2019. There, the team managed to go to the finals against FunPlus Phoenix, but was defeated 3-0, with Caps's Pyke and Veigar picks rendered ineffective. This made Caps the first European player to ever play (and lose) two Worlds Finals in a row.  2020 Season  In the pre-season between 2019 and 2020 Caps switched his position from mid lane to bot lane. Once again Caps and G2 ended up taking first place in the regular season. When playoffs arrived, G2's first matchup was against rookie squad Mad Lions. G2 lost this series 2-3, which lead to G2 having to play in the losers bracket to reach the finals. This went easy enough with G2 winning both the series against Origen and the rematch against MAD 3-1. In the finals against Fnatic, G2 showed what they could do and swept Caps' old team 3-0. After this success however Caps decided to swap back to the mid lane ahead of the LEC 2020 Summer Split.https://twitter.com/G2GrabbZ/status/1258156950845620228 Tournament results  Fnatic  * 5‚Äì8th ‚Äì 2017 League of Legends World Championship * 1st ‚Äì Rift Rivals 2018 NA-EU * 1st ‚Äì 2018 EU LCS Springfnatic-takes g2 win eu lcs ‚Äì espn.com * 1st ‚Äì 2018 EU LCS Summer * 2nd ‚Äì 2018 League of Legends World Championship  G2 Esports  * 1st ‚Äì 2019 LEC Spring * 1st ‚Äì 2019 Mid- Season Invitational * 1st ‚Äì 2019 LEC Summer * 2nd ‚Äì 2019 League of Legends World Championship * 1st - 2020 LEC Spring * 1st - 2020 LEC Summer  Individual Awards  *2020 LEC Summer MVP *2019 Mid-Season Invitational MVP *2019 LEC Spring MVP *2018 EU LCS Summer MVP  References   External links  *Matchhistory lolvvv.com Category:Fnatic players Category:League of Legends mid lane players Category:League of Legends AD Carry players Category:Danish esports players Category:Living people Category:1999 births Category:Twitch (service) streamers Category:G2 Esports players ","title":"Caps (gamer)"},{"id":"58903909","text":"Romeu Zema (born 28 October 1964) is a Brazilian businessman and the current Governor of the state of Minas Gerais.

Overview Written by left-handed fiddle player Tex Atchison, the song was first recorded in a Western swing style by Ole Rasmussen for Capitol Records in 1950, when Atchison played in Rasmussen's band, the Nebraska Cornhuskers, as they toured California.https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tex- atchison-mn0000031683/biographyhttp://www.45worlds.com/78rpm/record/nc075120us Billboard reviewed the 10-inch 78 rpm single, calling it a \\"real toe-tapper\\" appropriate for square dancing, with a \\"pert\\" vocal performance by Ted Wilds. Atchison may have based the song on a traditional Kentucky bluegrass tune known as \\"Get Up, John\\" or \\"Sleepy John\\". The song's name was taken as the moniker of radio disc jockey John Lepley, who went by Sleepy-Eyed John. In the mid-1950s, Lepley held down the afternoon slot at Memphis station WHHM, and he promoted musical acts at a local entertainment complex called Clearpool, featuring Western swing bands at the Eagle's Nest stage. Lepley booked Elvis Presley to perform in 1954 ‚Äì these early appearances helped Presley establish a fan base and his personal style.https://elvisdaily.com/2018/04/25/special- elvis-collectibles-at-the-last-auction-at-graceland/ Atchison's song saw its biggest success with Johnny Horton. Aided by a famous B-side ‚Äì Horton's version of Hank Williams' \\"They'll Never Take Her Love from Me\\" ‚Äì the 45 rpm record debuted on Billboards Country and Western chart in late April 1961, rising to number 9, and staying on the chart for eight weeks. A few months later, expatriate Tennessee country singer Johnny Duncan released a single of \\"Sleepy-Eyed John\\" on the Pye label in the UK, backed by his veteran UK band, the Blue Grass Boys. The flipside was another Atchison/Rasmussen tune: \\"I'm Still Bettin' on Love\\".http://www.45cat.com/record/7n15358 In 1972, the song was recorded by the Norwegian bluegrass group Christiania Fusel & Blaagress. The lyrics were translated into the Norwegian language to describe an eccentric villager with a wooden leg.https://tv.nrk.no/serie/landhandelen/fuha01000475/01-06-1975#t=22m59s In the late 1990s, Bear Family Records issued a retrospective set of Rasmussen songs on Compact disc, the set titled Sleepy-Eyed John.

Background Putin entered the 2004 election with a strong grasp on power an essentially no serious challengers for the presidential elections. During his first term Putin had further consolidated political power in Russia. In his first term as president Putin had overseen an upswing in the economic fortunes of Russia, giving him a strong level of public approval. Approximately three months in advance of the presidential election the Putin-backed United Russia party had swept the 2003 legislative election, while opposition parties experienced a strong decline in support. The legislative elections therefore further weakened opposition to Putin shortly before the election. Even before the legislative elections, observers had considered Russian politics to be more dominated by Putin than it had been by any individual since the fall of the Soviet Union. With Putin consistently leading in the polls by approximately 60%, most prominent opposition figures signaled their intent to forgo competing in the elections. Campaign Strategy Putin's campaign strategy involved minimal active campaigning on the candidate's part. Taking advantage of his high favorability and incumbency, his strategy was simply to appear presidential. His campaign undertook negative campaigning against candidates who actively challenged him. Favorable media bias Putin had a firm grasp of control over the Russian mediascape, thus allowing him to deny coverage to many of his opponents and circulate favorable coverage about himself. By sacking Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov during the campaign, Putin allowed for Russian political news coverage during the last three weeks of the election campaign to be preoccupied in reporting on the transition from the Kasyanov Cabinet to the Fradkov Cabinet, further depriving his opponents of media coverage. Platform For his reelection Putin put forth a platform with seven priorities.–ü—Ä–µ–¥–≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –≤—ã—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –í. –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω–∞: –ø—Ä–∏–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç—ã –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∏ FOM These were to improve Russia's quality of life, provide economic growth, integrate Russia into the global economy, undertake governmental reform (reducing the functions of the state government and the number of officials), health care reform, education reform, protecting the democratic rights and freedoms of Russian citizens, and taking effective antiterrorism measures.

At 1,793 km (1,114m), it is Turkmenistan's longest border and Uzbekistan's second longest (behind Uzbekistan's border with Kazakhstan). The border runs from the tripoint with Kazakhstan to the tripoint with Afghanistan. The Turkmenistan‚ÄìUzbekistan border was first established in 1925, when both countries were part of the Soviet Union as the Turkmen SSR and the Uzbek SSR respectively. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan became independent countries, making the Turkmenistan‚ÄìUzbekistan border an international border. A joint treaty was signed between Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in 2000, recognizing the post-independence border as the official border between the two countries, ending a decade of disputes and establishing the border's current shape. A border fence was constructed afterward. Map showing Turkmenistan with Uzbekistan to the north. Description The border starts in the west at the tripoint with Kazakhstan. It follows a roughly straight line eastwards before turning sharply north and then north-eastwards, passing through Sarygamysh Lake which straddles the border; also in this section is a long protrusion of Uzbek territory into Turkmenistan. The border then turns south-eastwards in the vicinity of Shumanay, following a somewhat convoluted course until it reaches the Amu Darya river in the vicinity of Pitnak and Gazojak; it then follows the river down to the 40th parallel north. The border then follows a series of straight lines segments south-east through the Karakum desert, before turning southwards through K√∂√Ωtendag Range down to the tripoint with Afghanistan on the Amu Darya. Much of the border is traversed by a major railway which crosses the border three times, a legacy of the Soviet era where infrastructure was built without regard to what were then internal boundaries.  History  Russia had conquered Central Asia in the 19th century by annexing the formerly independent Khanates of Kokand and Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara. After the Communists took power in 1917 and created the Soviet Union it was decided to divide Central Asia into ethnically-based republics in a process known as National Territorial Delimitation (or NTD). This was in line with Communist theory that nationalism was a necessary step on the path towards an eventually communist society, and Joseph Stalin‚Äôs definition of a nation as being ‚Äúa historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture‚Äù. The NTD is commonly portrayed as being nothing more than a cynical exercise in divide and rule, a deliberately Machiavellian attempt by Stalin to maintain Soviet hegemony over the region by artificially dividing its inhabitants into separate nations and with borders deliberately drawn so as to leave minorities within each state.The charge is so common as to have become almost the conventional wisdom within mainstream journalistic coverage of Central Asia, with Stalin himself often the one drawing the borders, see for example Stourton, E. in The Guardian, 2010 Kyrgyzstan: Stalin's deadly legacy https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/kyrgyzstan-stalins- deadly-legacy; Zeihan, P. for Stratfor, 2010 The Kyrgyzstan Crisis and the Russian Dilemma https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/kyrgyzstan-crisis-and- russian-dilemma; The Economist, 2010 Kyrgyzstan - Stalin's Harvest https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/17/stalins- harvest?story_id=16377083; Pillalamarri, Akhilesh in the Diplomat, 2016, The Tajik Tragedy of Uzbekistan https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/the-tajik-tragedy- of-uzbekistan/; Rashid, A in the New York Review of Books, 2010, Tajikistan - the Next Jihadi Stronghold? https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/11/29/tajikistan-next-jihadi-stronghold; Schreck, C. in The National, 2010, Stalin at core of Kyrgyzstan carnage, https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/stalin-at-core-of-kyrgyzstan- carnage-1.548241 Though indeed the Soviets were concerned at the possible threat of pan-Turkic nationalism,Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39-40 as expressed for example with the Basmachi movement of the 1920s, closer analysis informed by the primary sources paints a much more nuanced picture than is commonly presented.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 24-5, 182-3Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 13Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 46 The Soviets aimed to create ethnically homogeneous republics, however many areas were ethnically-mixed (e.g. the Ferghana Valley) and it often proved difficult to assign a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô ethnic label to some peoples (e.g. the mixed Tajik-Uzbek Sart, or the various Turkmen/Uzbek tribes along the Amu Darya).Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 47 Local national elites strongly argued (and in many cases overstated) their case and the Soviets were often forced to adjudicate between them, further hindered by a lack of expert knowledge and the paucity of accurate or up-to- date ethnographic data on the region.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 53 Furthermore NTD also aimed to create ‚Äòviable‚Äô entities, with economic, geographical, agricultural and infrastructural matters also to be taken into account and frequently trumping those of ethnicity.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 43-4Starr, S.

However, the Turkmen Communist elite pushed hard for the creation of a united Turkmen SSR, aided by the fact that the region was relatively homogeneous.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 49-51 However ethnic identities along the Amu Darya were complex and it was often difficult to judge which groups were ‚ÄòTurkmen‚Äô and which ‚ÄòUzbek‚Äô (e.g. the Salur, Bayad, Kurama, Ersar√Ø, Kh√Ødar-Al√Ø etc.).Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 60-1 Turkmen Communists pushed for a ‚Äòmaximalist‚Äô Turkmenistan, opting to include all ambiguous groups as Turkmen.Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Names ation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 62 Their efforts gained them the cities of Farap and Chardzhou (modern T√ºrkmenabat), both of which were also claimed by the Uzbeks.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 139, 187 The Uzbeks were particular outraged when the city of Tashauz (modern Da≈üoguz) was given to Turkmenistan despite it having a predominantly Uzbek population, as the Soviet authorities deemed the Turkmen SSR to be lacking in cities, deemed essential for industrial development.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 185-6Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 276Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pgs. 63 The Uzbek SSR in 1928, showing the then border split into two non- contiguous sections by Kazakh Karakalpakstan. At this time what is now Tajikistan was included within the Uzbek SSR The Turkmen SSR and the Uzbek SSR were officially created in 1924. Uzbekistan at this time did not include the then much larger Karakalpakstan ASSR, hence the border originally consisted of two separate non-contiguous sections divided by the Kazak ASSR; in 1936 the Karakalpak ASSR was transferred to the Uzbek SSR and the border took its current shape. The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. After some tensions in the 1990s Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan agreed to respect the traditional inter-republic border, with a joint treaty to this effect being signed in 2000 by Presidents Saparmurat Niyazov and Islom Karimov. On March 30, 2001 Turkmenistan's President Saparmurat Niyazov ordered his government to finish construction of the 1,700-kilometer border fence along Turkmenistan's border with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan by the end of the year to prevent smuggling and illegal migration: > And here we have our border issues too.

First published between 1826 and 1827, the work has three parts: \\"A Tale of the Foundation of the Great Island (now North America);\\" \\"A Real Account of the Settlement of North America and their Dissentions\\", and \\"Origin of the Kingdom of the Five Nations.\\" It was among the earliest English- language attempts to record Native American history from a Native American perspective.  Background  Cusick was the son of Nicholas Cusick, a Tuscarora sachem and interpreter in upstate New York. Born around 1780, David was (like his father) a veteran of America's wars; he fought in the War of 1812 and was, also like his father, a student of Iroquois oral tradition. A physician, painter, and writer, he probably have had some standing in the Tuscarora community; however, little is known about Cusick's life. Although little is also known about the source of his Sketches, correspondence between the author and historian H. G. Spafford suggests that by late 1825 Cusick did not sell his manuscript, continued the project alone and had it published in Lewiston, New York. Driven to preserve the Iroquois tradition, he reveals in a preface to the 1828 edition that he found himself demoralized and unsuited to the task; \\"the history [was] involved with fables.\\" He tried again, and produced a pamphlet of sketches: some myth, some fact, some a blend of the two, all intended \\"to throw some light on the history\\" (unrecorded) \\"of the original population of the country.\\" Notable aspects of Cusick's preface are his admission that there was no consensus about Iroquois history, and any interpretation he made was likely to be contentious; the humility of his tone, and his observation that truth and myth were indistinct. Iroquois fables were so closely bound to its history as to be inseparable, and Sketches begins with a fantastic origin tale.  Synopsis   Part One: Creation  In the upper world was a woman, bearing twins, who slept one evening and (as if by magic) sank through the earth into the \\"great deep\\".. She was caught by a giant turtle, on whose shell she climbed toward the surface. During the ascent, the turtle transformed into an island of earth; the twins (one of whom was possessed \\"[with] an evil opinion\\") fought within their mother's womb and the mother, succumbing to her \\"painful condition,\\" died shortly after giving birth. The turtle assumed the form of an island, and the twins grew up. One was called Enigonhahetgea (\\"the bad mind\\"), and the other Enigorio (\\"the good mind\\"). Enigonhahetgea took to the dark; Enigorio took to the light, and set off on the business of creation. He took his deceased mother's head and fashioned an \\"orb\\" (the sun), which he laid at the center of the firmament. Enigorio made the moon from her body, and from the earth he sculpted \\"his own likeness, male and female\\". Breathing life into them, he conceived the Eagwehowe (Real People) and gave them the Great Island. As the good mind created, the bad mind undid. They met in combat from which the good mind emerged victorious, ending the age of creation and beginning the age of humankind.  Part Two: First Peoples  Seneca ho-de-no-sote (left Two millennia before the arrival of Christopher Columbus, the Eagwehowe people of the north settled along the river Kanawage and were besieged by a clan of \\"giants\\": the Ronnongwetowanea. According to legend, the giants raided a household consisting of a chieftain, six brothers and a sister; the giant- leader carried the sister off and made her his wife. The oldest brother pursued his sister, but was killed. The youngest brother, Donhtonha, followed his brother's path toward the giants' lair. He killed the king; his sister fled into the woods to die of grief, and was said to have ascended to the heavens and become a northern star. After a period of conflict between the Ronnongwetowanea and Eagwehoewe peoples, there was a brief peace which ended in a tumult of hostility when the trickster Shotyeronsgwea sowed chaos throughout the land. The Big Quisquiss, a mammoth, brought devastation to settlements south of Lake Ontario. The northern nations became a confederation and declared war on the emperor of the south, beginning a century-long conflict which the north won. A serpent appeared on Lake Ontario, bringing plague. A blazing star fell from the sky, bringing a fiery death to all in its path. The Great Island had devolved into chaos, and was once more \\"in possession of fierce animals.\\"  Part Three: The Six Nations  According to Iroquois legend, the tribes have battled foes from the invading Otneyarheh (\\"Stonish Giants\\") to prehistoric creatures such as the Lake Serpent, \\"Flying Heads\\" and musqueto and wars with the Odawa, Erian, and Mississauga nations. All appear in Cusick's narrative. Sketches is a story of pervasive conflict and settlement. Each chapter is prefaced by an allusion to Columbus, whose \\"discovery\\" looms large over the narrative. The frame on which the history is threaded stretches north to the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, west to the Mississippi River and Rocky Mountains, and south to a paradise-like \\"Golden City.\\" It begins as the Kuskehsawkich people, beckoned by Tarenyawagon (\\"the Holder of the Heavens\\") followed the sunrise toward the rivers Yenonanatche and Shaw-nay-taw-ty, along whose banks the Holder directed the Te-haw-re-ho-geh (Mohawk) tribe to settle. The New-haw-teh-tah-go were settled next, near the creek called Kaw-na-taw-te-ruh; then the Seuh-now-kah-tah, atop the Onondaga mountain; the Sho-nea-na-we-to-wah near lake Go-yo-goh; the Te- hoo-nea-nyo-hent at the foot of a mountain near Canandaigua; and the Kau-tan- oh-akau at Cau-ta-noh, near the mouth of the Neuse River. Map of the Five Nations (1730) Once they all spoke one language, but now their languages were different. The Holder of the Heavens returned and organized them into a confederacy, the Ggo-nea-seab-neh (Long House), composed of the five families: Tea-kaw-reh-ho-geh (Mohawks), New-haw-teh-tah-go (Oneidas), Seuh-nau-ka-ta (Onondagas), Sho-nea-na-we-to-wah (Cayugas) and Te-hoo-nea-nyo-hent (Senecas); later, the Kau-tan-oh-akau (Tuscaroras) joined the confederacy. Another divine agent visited the confederacy, imparting lessons in reason and morality and \\"seeds for corn, beans, squashes, potatoes, and tobacco.\\" The Holder of the Heavens departed, leaving the country vulnerable to plundering ‚Äì first by the Ko-nea-rau-neh-neh (or Flying Heads) and then by the Lake Serpent and the Otne-yar-heh (Stonish Giants), who brought the Long House to heel. Their subjugation ended with the opportune, triumphant return of the Holder of the Heavens. Some time later, the serpent returned and settled on the main path linking the Five Families. The confederacy sent their best warriors, who slew the monster after a difficult battle. The Holder again descended to advise the ways of war, and the following years were marked by civil strife. The serpent- headed chieftain Atotarho led the hostilities at first, before becoming a lawmaker renowned for restoring the bonds among the Five Families and establishing Onondaga as the political and social heart of the confederacy. The Senecas (with the help of allies) conquered the Squawkihows, some of whom remained on in the country as vassals. The Oyalkquoher, (\\"big bear\\") invaded next, followed by the musqueto. The Oneidas extended their domain under Atotarho III. About \\"800 years\\" before Columbus's arrival, \\"the Twakanhahorss (now Mississaugers) ceded the colonies lying between the Kea-nau-hau-sent (Oak-Orchard creek) and the Onyakarra (Niagara) river to the Five Nations.\\" Two stories from this period typify its violence and unpredictability. The first is about Soh-nou-re-wah (\\"Big Neck\\"), a child who became a giant and committed atrocities but who was a great hunter. After outstaying his welcome in the community (despite his hunting ability), he built a fort on the Kau- nau-seh-wah-tua-yea river from which he would attack his enemies before he was killed by three warriors near the riverbank. The second concerns a boy near Fort Jenneatowaka who found Kaistowanea, a two-headed serpent which he brought home and which became large and vicious enough to besiege the fort. Kaistowanea ate the entire fort except for one warrior and his sister, who pierced the serpent's heart. Kaistowanea retreated to a nearby lake and died, and the Councilfire ‚Äì the seat of government ‚Äì was moved from Jenneatowaka to Thau-gwe-took, west of Geneva Lake. About 650 years before Columbus's discovery, King Ototarho IV commissioned a western expedition of fifteen men and two captains to \\"explore the countries toward to the setting sun.\\" The king of Ottauwah sent two of his warriors to join the party. They forded the Mississippi and continued west, contacting the Dog Tail Nation and another unnamed nation; both were friendly. Before reaching the Rocky Mountains, they were blocked by a giant; realizing that their journey was over, they returned to the king and told him about the western lands. About 200 years later, the Twakanhah (Messissaugers) declared war on the Five Nations and were routed by the Senecas at Fort Kauhanauka; several other skirmishes took place on Ontario lake. The commander at fort Kauhanauka became ambitious and amassed an army of 2,000 warriors to cross the Niagara river and reach the lake, where they were beaten back by the Twakanhah. At a stalemate, the Five Nations and the Twakanhah struck a tentative peace. Around this time, the Iroquois codified their ethics. Each nation was composed of tribes, and each tribe appointed two chiefs to settle disputes. In a case of murder, for example, the closest relative of the victim executed the murderer with a club. Victim and murderer were laid in the same grave, and aggrieved relatives were sometimes offered restitution. Two adulterous women had their heads shaved, and thieves were brutally whipped. The Mohawks were \\"considered an eldest brother\\" who kept watch \\"towards the sunrise\\", and the Senecas kept watch toward the sunset. Representatives met annually at fort Onondaga to legislate. Each nation was \\"free and independent\\", with its own jurisdiction and an obligation to aid its fellow nations in times of war. There were a \\"national committee\\" and \\"Chief Ruler,\\" whom the nation vested with the power of a \\"peace-maker.\\" The Tuscarora were reportedly visited about 400 years before Columbus's landing by an elderly diviner who told them that \\"beyond the great water\\" whites had committed deicide, killing their \\"Maker,\\" and nothing would stop their march to the Big Island. The man died, then rose from his grave. The Erian tribe seceded from the Senecas and settled the lands between the Genesee and Niagara Rivers. As they grew in influence, war broke out between them and the Iroquois. The confederacy won the early encounters and, fearing imminent defeat, the Erian queen Yagowanea sued for a favorable peace and they were returned to their country. The Long House had become numerous and powerful and could assemble an army of \\"23,000 warriors,\\" adding the Tuscarora to their ranks. At the apparent zenith of their power, however, chaos ensued. Another prophet appeared, \\"foretell[ing that] the whites would cross the Big Waters and bring strong liquors, and bye up the red people's lands\\" and exhorting them not to acquiesce \\"lest they should ruin themselves and displease their Maker.\\" By the time Columbus discovered America in 1492 (during the reign of Atotarho XIII), the Five Nations were driving the Keatahkiehroneah and Erian tribes out of their country. For a short time, peace prevailed.  Significance  In a variation on the earth-diver myth, Sketches begins with an essentially-Manichaean story of Iroquois origins redolent of Old Testament narratives in which Good and Evil battle. Most of the pamphlet concerns the founding of the Long House, a narrative which asserts the primacy of the Iroquois in Native American history. Cusick paints a portrait of a people unassailable in the face of wave after wave of treacherous, often bestial, enemies. He reminds his American audience, whose independence was described as unique, that \\"the Long House were free and independent nations, and have been acknowledged in such treaties made with them by neighboring nations.\\" Because Sketches also bears on the present moment, Cusick emphasizes statecraft and insists on Iroquois solidarity in the present tense: \\"Every independent nation have a government of their own ... a national committee ... [and] a Chief Ruler.\\" If the Native American character was being besmirched, Cusick intended to correct the perception and ortray the Iroquois as a formidable, irrepressible people for whom the United States government was another in a long series of adversaries.  Reception  Unique when published, Sketches was criticized and has been consigned to the margins of history ‚Äì a footnote in Native American literary anthologies. Contemporary reviews by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft and Francis Parkman were particularly harsh, with Parkman reluctant to write about it at all. Cusick had \\"produced a small pamphlet in a language almost unintelligible, and filled with a medley of traditions in which a few grains of truth are inextricably mixed with a tangled mass of absurdities.\\"Parkman, Francis.

It is a form of altruism which means that the behaviors involved often require a sacrifice that could put their own survival at risk. Parental care encompasses behaviors that aide in the evolutionary success of the offspring (like nest building), and parental investment, which is a measure of expenditure (time, energy, etc.) exerted by the parent in an attempt to provide evolutionary benefits to the offspring. Therefore, it is a measure of the benefits versus costs of engaging in the parental behaviors. Another important aspect of parental care is whether the care is provided to the offspring by each parent in a relatively equal manner, or whether it is provided predominantly or entirely by one parent. There are several species that exhibit biparental care, where behaviors and/or investment in the offspring is divided equally amongst the parents. This parenting strategy is common in birds. Even in species who exhibit biparental care, the maternal role is essential since the females are responsible for the incubation and/or delivery of the young. Although maternal care is essential in many classes of vertebrates, it is the most prevalent in mammals, since the care from the mother is essential for feeding and nourishing their young. Because the care exhibited by the mother plays such a large role in mammals, the role of the male is often very limited. Maternal care begins during fertilization and pregnancy however, the most prominent array of maternal behaviors are exhibited by the mother after the birth of their offspring and until the offspring are capable of being independent. The duration that the offspring stays with the mother and receives care, and the types of care behavior displayed by the mother varies amongst different species, forms of reproduction, and the level of development in the offspring at birth.  Mammals  Mammals are a class of vertebrates that contain mammary glands which secrete milk that nourishes their offspring. This maternal behavior is unique from all other vertebrate classes. The basic maternal care patterns in mammals involve the internal incubation during gestation, the delivery of young, and maternal care until the young are weaned. The way a female mammal cares for their young depends on the level of maturation of the offspring at birth. There are three main categories of newborn maturation that different species of mammals exhibit. Altricial young (marsupials, rodents) are completely helpless and dependent on their mothers, precocial young (elephants, cattle) have highly developed sensory and motor functions at birth, and primates who are semi-helpless young, have an intermediate level of maturation. This variation in maturation at birth requires different maternal care from the mother.  Altricial species  Altricial young are born deaf, blind, almost completely hairless and have very limited motor functioning. The maternal behavior in these species is primarily focussed on providing warmth for the young since they are unable to thermoregulate. This is achieved through the utilization of pouches in marsupial species, and the construction of nests in rodents and other altricial species. Because the young are not capable of locomotion, many other maternal behaviors take place at the nest as well, including feeding, nursing and grooming (licking). Members of this species are unable to recognize their own young and therefore will care for all the young in the nest equally, regardless of whether or not it is their own offspring. Once the young reach a point in their sensory, and motor development and no longer require the nutrients from their mothers milk, they will leave the nest and the mother will discontinue her maternal care behaviors.  Precocial species  Precocial young are born with a highly developed sensory and motor system. At birth they are able to see, hear, and most can walk or will learn to walk within the first few days after birth. The females in these species have adapted to be able to recognize their own young, which allows them to be selective about who they choose to care for. They will reject other young who try to nurse from them. The primary focus of these species is to develop an exclusive relationship with their young which allows for the resources and energy expenditure of the mother to be optimized by the offspring and not wasted on other young. This is essential for their success and fitness.  Primates  Primates are born with intermediate maturation of altricial and precocial species. Newborns have limited motor functioning, but have highly developed sensory systems and the ability to thermoregulate. A unique characteristic in the maternal behavior in primates is that the mothers carry their young until their locomotive abilities develop. The mother will either carry the young in their arms, or the young will attach itself to the mother and cling to her. This is known as matricolia.  Birds  Birds belong to a class of vertebrates that are oviparous and exhibit extensive parental behaviors. These behaviors are called brooding behaviors which include the incubation of the unhatched eggs and the care of the chicks after they have hatched. During incubation, the mother sits on her eggs which keeps them warm while the unhatched chicks are developing in the eggs. Once the eggs hatch, the mother will care for and feed her chicks until they reach maturation. Biparental care is common in birds, where the role of the male involves finding food and defending the nest, and the maternal behaviors involve caring for the chicks in the nest. In many cases, the male will regurgitate partially digested food into the mouth of the female and then the female will distribute the food equally amongst her chicks by regurgitating it for a second time into the mouths of the chicks.  Brood parasitism  Brood parasitism is a reproductive strategy exhibited in some birds where a parasitic bird will lay their eggs in the nest of a host who will care for foreign chick once it is hatched. The parasitic birds do not display maternal behaviors and have therefore evolved ways to ensure the success of their offspring by having it be raised by a host. As a result, the host birds natural maternal behaviors are effected and they often neglect to care for their own offspring.  Reptiles  Reptiles have a large diversity of maternal behaviors that is very dependent on the species and the type of reproduction it displays. Most reptiles are viviparous, although oviparous reptiles do exist. Oviparous reptiles often display very little or no maternal behavior after the eggs have hatched, while viviparous reptiles typically exhibit more extensive maternal care. Nile crocodiles however, are the exception to this. The females exhibit maternal care behaviors that involve transporting their young in their mouths shortly after they have hatched, to the waters edge and remain with the young until they have reached further development  Neurobiological influences on maternal behavior  In mammals, the medial pre optic area of the brain is responsible for the initiation of maternal behaviors. In a non maternal female, this action in this area of the brain is inhibited by the medial amygdala but during parturition, the inhibition stops which cause the female to exhibit behaviors related to the maternal care of their newly born offspring. During the parturition, the paraventricular nucleus starts to produce oxytocin ( along with other hormones) which aids in the delivery of the young, as well as the behaviors exhibited by the mother after birth. Prolactin and glucorticoides are chemicals that also play a role in the initiation of maternal behavior in both birds and mammals. Prolactin is involved in the interactions between a mother and their offspring, while glucorticoides are released when the mother is expending energy and resources causing her to work harder in order to properly care for her young.

Oracle and Public Advertiser (London, England), 5 August 1796; Issue 19 392. Capture On 3 October 1796 Experiment was off Cabo de Gata when she sighted a convoy that Hayes believed was under Sir Hyde Parker, whom he knew was in the area. Experiment had been sent to the area to watch for any signs of a French fleet, and Hayes decided to close with the convoy to see if there was any new information. As he did so, a vessel detached itself from the convoy and sailed toward him, but without showing any colours. Hayes was not concerned as he was convinced she was British. He went below to dress in readiness to go aboard the frigate. When he came on deck half an hour later he was horrified to discover that the frigate was not only very close but she was now sailing parallel to Experiment. The frigate then hoisted Spanish colours. The rest of the fleet was now approaching and it was too late for Experiment to escape. The frigate fired a shot and Hayes struck. The 40-gun frigate was Santa Sabina. The fleet was under the command of Don Juan de L√°ngara and had sailed from Cadiz on 26 September. War between Spain and England did not formally begin until 5 October, but since 15 September the British had begun to seize any Spanish vessels coming into British ports. Recapture The privateer Felicity, Michael Novella, master, recaptured Experiment in February 1806. At the time Experiment was armed with four 4-pounder guns and had a crew of 30 men. He also captured a French 3-gun privateer and two Spanish gunboats. Neither Felicity nor Novella appear in a listing of British letters of marque, and Novella reported his captures to Gibraltar, suggesting that perhaps Felicity was a Gibraltar-based privateer.

Operational history  The corps was formed on 20 May 1940 in Wehrkreis IV with a home station at Naumburg, which was changed to Bautzen on 8 June. It was initially part of the Oberkommando des Heeres Reserve, becoming part of 9th Army of Army Group A in northern France by July. It transferred to the 17th Army of Army Group B in the General Government during March and April 1941 in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The corps transferred to the 6th Army with Army Group B in May, fighting with the army as part of Army Group South when the invasion began on 22 June. It Included the 111th, 299th, and 56th Infantry Divisions on 1 May. The corps participated in actions along the Bug River, the Battle of Kiev, and at Belgorod between June and December, continuing to fight at Belgorod until July 1942. In August the corps was transferred to the reserve of Army Group B, then assigned to the 8th Italian Army of the army group between September and December, fighting on the Don River during the Battle of Stalingrad. Following the destruction of the 8th Italian Army the corps was assigned to Army Detachment Hollidt in January 1943, fighting on the Don and the Donets until February with Army Group Don. The XXIX Army Corps continued to serve with Army Detachment Hollidt on the Mius-Front in March, part of Army Group South. It transferred to the recreated 6th Army in April, and retreated during the Battle of the Dnieper in October with the army as part of Army Group A. The corps fought on the Dnieper and at Krivoi Rog from November as part of the 1st Panzer Army, transferring back to the 6th Army in January 1944. The 6th Army transferred back to Army Group A along with the corps in March as it retreated southwest to Uman, fighting against the Soviet Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive. With Army Group South Ukraine the corps and 6th Army retreated to the Bug and the Dniester during April and May. In June and July it held positions around Kishinev as part of the Romanian 3rd Army, retreating into Transylvania during the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive as part of 6th Army in August. After 6th Army was destroyed the corps was directly assigned to Army Group South Ukraine in September, then retreated into Upper Hungary with the 8th Army of Army Group South in October. Between January and March it fought on the Hron, and in April rejoined 1st Panzer Army as part of Army Group Centre in Moravia, surrendering there at the end of the war.

Damage  Three high-voltage towers were destroyed by the tornado in the region near the Toyota building. In all, 220 electric power poles were toppled and damaged; and schools, health posts and part of the city hall were also destroyed. At least 400 houses were damaged; and strong winds knocked down walls, roofs, metal structures, poles, sheds, and trees. There were at least 400 companies in the industrial district, of which 15 were totally destroyed. In addition, all 720 companies that exist in the region have stood by the lack of electricity. The force of the wind knocked down and derailed 18 wagons that were empty and parked on the Ferroban lines in the Pimenta neighborhood, each wagon weighing approximately 25 tons. The buildings of the National Industrial Service (Senai) were destroyed by the tornado, which dismantled the gate, caused smashing, broke windows, ripped trees and knocked down the fences. Following a destructive trail through the city, the tornado hit the neighborhoods Esplanada, Pau Preto, Remulo Zoppi, Cecap, Jardim Renata, Mercedes, Oliveira Camargo and Pimenta. However, the Industrial District was the hardest hit neighborhood. The wind tossed parts of the roofs of several sheds, which were found at a distance of up to three kilometers. Some structures have even crossed the Santos Dumont highway.  Victims  At least 60 people were left homeless, of which 35 were sent by the City Hall to the Maria Benedita Municipal School in Jardim Morada do Sol. The rest went to relatives' homes.

The sanctuary was founded on the Ortygia in the Piazza Archimede. Numerous female terracotta figurines from the 8th-century BC has been excavated. The sanctuary was moved to the acropolis of Syracuse in the 5th century BC. The cult of Demeter was benefited by Gelon, tyrant of Syracuse, as a way to unite the Greek population during his expansionism on Sicily. Gelon was the hereditary chief priest of Demeter's cult in Gela, a cult that was popular also in Syracuse and Camarina, and he used the Demeter cult as well as the fight against Carthage to unite Syracuse, Gela and Camarina. After his successful war against Carthage, Gelon used the spoils of war to finance the new sanctuary of Demeter in Syracuse. The new sanctuary was situated below the Piazza Vittoria in Syracuse. Remains has been found of a large sanctuary including a temple stereobate and the foundations of an altar. A great quantity of votive material has been found on the site. The sanctuary was described by Plato as the location of the city Thesmophoria. The Thesmophoria lasted ten days in Syracuse, in contrast to the three days in Athens. The festival has been described by Plutarch, as well as by Athenaeus: : \\"... in Syracuse, on the Day of Consummation at the Thesmophoria, cakes of sesame and honey were moulded in the shape of female pudenda, and called throughout the whole of Sicily mylloi and carried about in honour of the goddesses. \\" Gelon spread the cult to Syracuse's dependencies Aetna, Himera and Acrae, and the cult of Demeter and Persephone was to spread throughout all Sicily and become immensely popular in the entire island.

Asplund demonstrated an early interest in politics and women's issues, writing to a friend at the age of 15, \\"I am very strong for women's rights, you know. I think I shall become a second Susan B. Anthony.\\" She was educated at the Drexel Institute of Library Sciences in Philadelphia, graduating in 1901. In 1903 she went to Albuquerque to organize the Territorial University's library. In 1905 she married fellow faculty member Rupert Asplund, with whom she had one child. The family moved to Santa Fe in 1909. Around that time Asplund turned her attention towards establishing a system of free traveling libraries in New Mexico. In 1911 she joined the New Mexico Federation of Women‚Äôs Clubs (NMFWC) and served on the library extension committee almost continually through 1929. Between 1914 and 1916 she was the president of the New Mexico Federation of Women's Clubs. A leader in the suffrage movement in New Mexico, she wrote in an editorial for \\"The Outlook\\" in 1927, \\"...we have found the suffrage of great assistance to women in speeding up the program of welfare work which was started by their organizations more than ten years ago...we knew exactly what we wanted and we got it. More than that, we are using it and we expect to go on using it...\\" Asplund was the first librarian for the University of New Mexico and the first woman regent of the University of New Mexico, serving from 1921 to 1923. She chaired the New Mexico State Library Commission from 1941 through 1954. In 1920, a month after New Mexico ratified the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, extending suffrage to women, Julia Brown Asplund was nominated for governor as part of an all-female ticket selected by the New Mexico Woman's Party. Asplund declined the nomination, however, in favor of an appointment to the Republican State Central Committee. She later served as the Director of the State Library Agency from 1929 to 1932 and 1941 to 1954. She was a member of numerous civic organizations and social clubs, including the New Mexico Commission on Welfare of Women and Children, Commissioner of Management Santa Fe Public Library, the Santa Fe Woman's Club, and the Daughters of the American Revolution. Asplund died on July 26, 1958 in Pasadena, California.

Working under Miguel Garc√≠a-Garibay and Kendall Houk‚Äôs supervision, he later attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as a graduate student where he received a Ph.D. from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in 2006. He then attended the University of California, Santa Barbara where he worked on polymer chemistry with Craig Hawker. Career Campos has started his independent academic career in 2011 at Columbia University in the Department of Chemistry. At Columbia, Campos is directing a research team with broad interests focused on nanostructured materials, macromolecular systems, and single-molecule electronics. Research Campos research group explores molecular, macromolecular, and nanostructured materials that allow for advanced functional systems to be formed. The group is trained to adjust such materials using molecular design. Campos‚Äô main strategy is to be able to understand a structure in order to better produce materials to help advance biology, engineering, physics, and processing. Nanostructured materials Nanostructured materials deal with block copolymers and assembles themselves. Campos and colleagues developed copolymers that can self-assemble into different nanoparticles. The research aspires to develop a light-weight, energy efficient devices from the polymers by understanding how to control architecture of these block copolymers. Molecular and macromolecular systems By controlling molecular structures, such physical properties can be manipulated. Campos and colleagues also work on the development of chemistry for the next generation solar cell technologies. Specifically, they have made several important contributions to making singlet fission materials that can create triplet pairs. This material is utilized to generate parts required for organic photovoltaics. Single- molecule electronics Studies involving single-molecule transport demonstrate how particular designs lead the synthesis of macromolecular materials. This also allows for chemists to adjust the functionality of a chemical. This research allows for exceptional transport technology. Awards and honors Campos has received recognition for his academic work. He has received several awards throughout his post-graduate career. Such awards include the 2016 ACS Arthur C.

Her sculptures and installations utilize a wide range of materials‚Äîincluding reflective mirrors, antique books and furniture, chiseled marble, bottles of perfume‚Äîand draw on both her training in architecture and the tools of minimalism and conceptualism.  Education and career  Valeska Soares received a Bachelor of Architecture from the Universidade Santa √örsula, Rio de Janeiro, in 1987. In 1990, she completed a graduate certificate in the History of Art and Architecture from the Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica of Rio de Janeiro. She presented her first solo exhibition in 1991 at Rio's Espa√ßo Cultural S√©rgio Porto. That same year she was awarded a fellowship from Coordena√ß√£o de Aperfei√ßoamento de Pessoal de N√≠vel Superior (CAPES) to obtain an MFA from Pratt Institute. In 1994, after completing her MFA, she became a Doctor of Arts Candidate at the New York University School of Education and had her first New York solo exhibition at the Information Gallery. In 2003 she had her first survey exhibition, Valeska Soares: Follies, which was presented by the Bronx Museum of the Arts and traveled to the Museo de Arte Contempor√¢neo in Monterrey in Mexico. Soares‚Äô work has been included in numerous international exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale of 2011 and 2005; the S√£o Paulo Biennial of 2009, 1998, and 1994; the Sharjah Biennial in 2009; the Taipei Biennal in 2006; the Liverpool Biennial in 2004; and the Havana Biennial in 1991.  Work  Soares' education in architecture solidified her interest in site specificity and artworks that consider their spatial context. Her work often explores the point of transition from one physical or psychological state to another. Soares's sculptures and installations repeatedly contrast slick, reflective materials such as stainless steel and mirrors, with more ephemeral ones, like roses and lilies, revealing her interest in matters of subjectivity, perception, reflection, and distortion. These mirrored surfaces are used as a way to engage the viewers, who transition from passive spectator to active participant. She also uses numerous other sensory techniques, like sound, and smell, to create new environments and experiences for viewers. Recurring themes in Soares' work are interpersonal relationships, glossaries, labyrinths, and gardens, elements through which the artist alludes to mythology, literature, and to art history itself.

Zuckerberg is also author of the book Not All Dead White Men (2018) on the appropriation of classics by misogynist groups on the Internet. Donna is one of three sisters of Mark Zuckerberg, founder of the social network site Facebook, Inc.. Early life and education Zuckerberg was born in Dobbs Ferry, New York in 1987, the third of four children. Her parents were a dentist and psychologist. She says the family was tight-knit and the parents encouraged their children to develop whatever talents they had. All three of her siblings, Mark Zuckerberg, Randi Zuckerberg and Arielle Zuckerberg, work in the technology sector. After earning a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Chicago, Zuckerberg earned her Ph.D. in classics at Princeton University in 2014, specializing in the study of ancient tragedy. The title of her doctoral thesis was The Oversubtle Maxim Chasers: Aristophanes, Euripides, and their Reciprocal Pursuit of Poetic Identity. Her doctoral adviser was Professor Andrew Ford. While completing her graduate studies, Zuckerberg wrote a food blog called Sugar Mountain Treats.  Career  Eidolon and scholarship The classicist Natalie Haynes notes that Zuckerberg \\"is a classicist with a strong Internet pedigree\\". Zuckerberg is the founder and editor-in-chief of the online journal Eidolon, which publishes texts about classics that are not formal scholarship. Its authors are well-established classicists as well as new experts in the field. Aside from Eidolon, Zuckerberg's work has been published in numerous popular publications, including the Times Literary Supplement, Jezebel, The Establishment, and Avidly. She has also written for mainstream publications about the use of the classics by the alt-right movement. In a 2018 op-ed in the Washington Post, she argues that the sexism and racism found in classic texts should be studied and discussed rather than ignored or, as right-wing ideologues are doing, celebrated. Natalie Haynes agrees with Zuckerberg's ideological stance, arguing that \\"ignoring these people is no longer the answer\\". Not All Dead White Men Zuckerberg's first monograph Not All Dead White Men: Classics and Misogyny in the Digital Age was published by Harvard University Press in October 2018. It has been described as \\"one of the first books to examine the online formation known as the Red Pill...also known as the manosphere\\". The \\"manosphere\\" includes numerous factions such as men's rights activists, pickup artists, and Men Going Their Own Way. The groups are united by the belief that they are disadvantaged by contemporary society which operates in favor of women. Zuckerberg's book is a reception study. It describes how the Red Pill movement online finds support for its sexist ideology in texts from ancient Greece and Rome, tracing the phenomenon back to its origins and describing its misappropriation of Ovid, Euripides, Xenophon's Oeconomicus and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. The book touches on the links between the Red Pill community and the white supremacy movement. The \\"Red Pill\\" is a cultural reference to the film The Matrix (1999), where Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) offers Neo (Keanu Reeves) the choice of the blue or red pill, giving blissful ignorance or gritty, painful truth respectively. Zuckerberg argues that \\"[t]he red pill metaphor really encapsulates for them [alt-right groups] the fact that they really see their misogyny and racism as a form of enlightenment. They are able to see the world more clearly than the rest of us‚Ä¶ and what they see is that white, heterosexual men are discriminated against in our society.\\" Zuckerberg's book also explores the popularity of stoicism within the manosphere. The book describes how Red Pill men use stoicism to support their belief in a dichotomy between the rational nature of males and the emotional nature of women. Zuckerberg argues that the point of the Red Pill discourse \\"is not for everything to hang together logically and to be totally immune to criticism. The point is to make people feel something‚Äîto make their audience feel validated and justified and scared and angry‚Äîand [get] any reaction [out of] them\\". Zuckerberg takes a feminist approach to classical antiquity, arguing that the ancient world was deeply misogynistic: \\"it was a time when there was no word for rape, feminism did not exist and women's actions were determined by male relatives\\". Alt-right groups are using classical texts, distorted and stripped of context, to add weight and authority to campaigns of misogyny and white supremacy. Zuckerberg's interest in the topic began in 2015 when she realized an article about Ovid in Eidolon saw heavy traffic from the Red Pill community on Reddit. In the same period, she read an interview with Neil Strauss, who mentioned seduction advice by Ovid. That research interest became a magazine article, then a book. The final draft of her book was submitted days before the 2016 United States elections. It then became relevant outside academia, as the grievances of many of the groups she studied entered the political mainstream at the highest level. Zuckerberg says that while her book was in production, the Red Pill movement started to focus more on policing women's reproductive rights, away from the more traditional \\"men's rights\\" issues such as child custody.  Critical response  The book has been generally well received. Natalie Haynes, Samuel Argyle, and Sarah Bond reviewed it positively, concurring with Zuckerberg's conclusions. In particular, Sarah Bond locates Zuckerberg within \\"a new generation of classicists, archaeologists, and premodern historians [who] have begun to realize that an insulated approach to scholarship is itself a form of privileged monasticism that we can no longer retreat to\\". Bond sees the work as shedding light into the crevices of the internet. Rachel O'Neill applauds Zuckerberg's willingness to subject the manosphere to scrutiny, given the lack of scholarship on the topic. It has been described as \\"a rare book from a university press that will probably be a crossover bestseller in non-academic markets\\". Matthew J. Sharpe, Associate Professor of Philosophy at Deakin University, has questioned whether Zuckerberg's portrayal of ancient Stoicism is wholly accurate. Criticism of social media Zuckerberg has spoken out against social media, arguing that it has created a toxic culture and given men 'with anti-feminist ideas to broadcast their views to more people than ever before ‚Äì and to spread conspiracy theories, lies and misinformation'. Zuckerberg understands that social media has elevated misogyny to 'entirely new levels of violence and virulence'. Honors Zuckerberg was the recipient of the 2017‚Äì18 Award for Special Service from the Classical Association of the Middle West and South. Zuckerberg spoke at the Jaipur Literature Festival 2019, where she was in conversation with biographer Patrick French and writer and editor Sharmila Sen.  Personal life  Zuckerberg lives in Silicon Valley with her husband and two children. Publications ;Monographs * Not All Dead White Men.

The paintings are theatrical depictions of events from the history of Ancient Rome, with a typically Venetian emphasis on drama and impact rather than historical accuracy. They were painted on shaped canvases and set into the architecture with frescoed surrounds. The Tarantine Triumph was the first work completed, depicting the triumph awarded to Manius Curius Dentatus after defeating Pyrrhus of Epirus in the Battle of Beneventum, the last battle of the Pyrrhic War in 275 BC, at which captured elephants were first seen in Rome. The Triumph of Marius was the last completed, depicting the triumph awarded to Gaius Marius after defeating Jugurtha of Numidia in the Jugurthine War: it is dated 1729, and includes a self-portrait of Tiepolo on the left. The differences in style and composition between the works demonstrate Tiepolio's rapid development as a painter. The series was quickly recognised as a masterpiece, and its success drove forward Tiepolo's career. He decorated buildings across Venice and the Veneto in the following decades. The paintings remained in Venice until sold in 1872, and are now held in three museums, with two held by the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, three by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and five by the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. Background Tiepolo was born in 1696. While still a young man in his 20s, he was commissioned by , the Patriarch of Aquileia, to decorate the Cappella del Santissimo Sacramento in Udine Cathedral (completed 1726) and then to paint a two cycles of Old Testament paintings for the (or arcivescovado) in Udine (completed 1726‚Äì1728), including and . The paintings from the Patriarchal Palace are now displayed in Udine's . Still only in his early 30s, Tiepolo was then commissioned by Dionisio's brother to paint a series of ten painting depicting scenes from Ancient Rome for a large reception room on the piano nobile at the family's house in Venice, the Ca' Dolfin building, on the north side of the just off the Grand Canal. The building had been constructed by the Secco family, and acquired by Cardinal Giovanni Dolfin in 1621. Before Tiepolo began work, the room had already been partially decorated with trompe-l'≈ìil wall paintings by Antonio Felice Ferrari c.1708 and ceiling frescos by Niccol√≤ Bambini c.1714. Gaps in the walls had been left, filled with blank canvases to be painted in oils later: the combination of fresco and oil painting is unusual, but allows artists to switch between mediums according to the season. Description The paintings are reconstructions of historical scenes from Ancient Rome. In several cases, the identification of the intended subjects are not certain, but they appear to be an account of the expansion of the Roman Empire, from the (possibly legendary) event when Scaevloa thrust his hand into the sacrificial fire before Lars Porsena c.509 BC and the deaths of Lucius Junius Brutus and Arruns Tarquinius (son of Tarquin the Proud) at the Battle of Silva Arsia in 509 BC, through the wars against the Latin tribes of Italy, including Gaius Marcius Coriolanus and Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus fighting against the Volsci, Corioli and Aequi in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the victory of Manius Curius Dentatus over Pyrrhus of Epirus near Taranto in 275 BC, the Second Punic War at the end of the 3rd century including Quintus Fabius Maximus, Hannibal, and the capture of Carthage, to the victory of Gaius Marius over the Cimbri at the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC. It is possible that the victory of the Romans over Carthage was intended as an allegory for the victory of the Republic of Venice over the Ottoman Empire. The irregular profiles of the canvases were determined by the architectural features into which they were inserted. The room in Venice has survived, with the recesses now filled with mirrors, so shape of the canvases allows a reconstruction of the original arrangement of the paintings in the room. On the long walls to either side of the main door on the north side were two battle scenes, each measuring approximately , and usually identified as The Capture of Carthage and The Battle of Vercellae (both at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York). (Alternatively, they may represent battles of Coriolanus against the Volsci and Corioli.) The opposite long wall has five arched windows overlooking the canal to the south. Two narrower canvases, each approximately , were placed to either side of the central window, depicting The Death of Lucius Junius Brutus and Arruns Tarquinius, and Hannibal Contemplating the Head of Hasdrubal (both at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna). There were three paintings on the shorter walls to either side, with one large central painting flanked by two smaller ones. The paintings on the west wall, lit from the windows to the south, were The Triumph of Marius (also in New York) flanked by Quintus Fabius Maximus before the Roman Senate and Cincinnatus Offered the Dictatorship, and on the east wall opposite were The Tarantine Triumph flanked by Mucius Scaevola before Porsenna and Veturia Pleading with Coriolanus (all five at the Hermitage in St Petersburg). The tall central scenes measure approximately , and each of the four flaking scenes is approximately . Apart from the two battle scenes, the other eight canvases had banderoles explaining the subject, with Latin text taken from the Epitome of Roman History (\\"Epitome de T. Livio Bellorum omnium annorum DCC Libri duo\\"), an early 2nd century commentary attributed to Lucius Annaeus Florus on the 1st century AD History of Rome of Livy. The banderoles were painted over after the paintings were removed, but some have been restored later. The shapes of the canvases were also altered when they were removed from their original location in 1872, with additional areas added to square them off, but those in New York and Vienna have been restored to their original shapes. Tiepolo adopted a less retrained palette for these paintings than his earlier works, with elements of the Baroque or even the Rococo. Reception The paintings were quickly recognised as a masterpiece, praised by Vincenzo da Canal in 1732 as among Teipolo's best, and by Jean-Honor√© Fragonard in 1761 as among his most beautiful works in Venice. They remained in situ for over 200 years while the building was inherited by increasingly distant descendants of the Dolfin family, but the building was largely abandoned by 1870. The Palazzo Ca' Dolfin was acquired by the Ca' Foscari University of Venice in 1955, based at the Ca' Foscari nearby; restored, it is used as a guesthouse by the university, with the salone becoming the \\"Aula Magna\\", a great hall for events. To pay a tax bill, a family descendant sold the paintings in 1872 via the art dealer Moses Michelangelo Guggenheim to the Austrian collector Baron for 50,000 livres. The Baron had nowhere to display them: within a few years, he put them on sale again in Paris, and five were acquired by Alexander Polovtsov (sometimes spelled Polovzeff). In 1886, Polovtsov presented them to the Central School of Technical Drawing, which had been founded in St Petersburg by his father-in- law Alexander von Stieglitz. These five paintings have been held by the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg since 1934. The remaining five paintings were returned to Vienna and eventually displayed at the Baron's new Palais Miller von Aichholz. After the Baron's death in 1919, they were bought with the house by the Italian financier Camillo Castiglioni. After Castiglioni became bankrupt in 1924, two of the smaller paintings were sold to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna in 1930, and the three others were used as collateral for a loan from Dr Stefan Mendel, co-heir of the Austrian bakery business. They were stored in Zurich, and Mendel acquired them outright in 1935. He took them to New York when he emigrated, and they were kept in storage in Saranac Lake, New York for 30 years. After Mendel's death in 1965, they were sold by his estate to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. After a gallery at the Metropolitan Museum had been extended to creates a suitable space to hang them, and considerable restoration work, most of the paintings were reunited in New York for an exhibition in 1997.

It was intended to publish material specifically relevant to readers in the United States. It was established in 2001 and was discontinued permanently in 2005. History BMJ USA was launched in February 2001 by the BMJ Group, in conjunction with the Clifton, New Jersey-based publishing company Clinicians Group. The founding editor-in-chief of the journal was Ronald Davis, who was also the North American editor for the BMJ at the time. Its original plan was to publish mostly articles from the BMJ that were particularly relevant to American primary care physicians, as well as similar articles from fellow BMJ Group journals such as Heart and Gut. In an editorial in the inaugural issue, Davis and then-editor-in-chief of the BMJ Richard Smith wrote, \\"You will see very little etiologic or basic science research in the BMJ and BMJ USA. You will, instead, find papers on the common diseases of primary care such as asthma, depression, and hypertension and diabetes.\\" Beginning when BMJ USA was first established, monthly issues were sent to 100,000 primary care doctors in the United States. The journal generally republished articles from the BMJ about two months after they were originally published. In addition to articles that had already been published in other BMJ Group journals, each issue contained an editorial by an American author, as well as a number of papers submitted specifically for publication in BMJ USA. In 2002, it became available online. In September 2002, Steven Woolf (Virginia Commonwealth University) became the new editor-in-chief of the journal, remaining in this position until 1 July 2003, when he was replaced by former Assistant Surgeon General of the United States Douglas Kamerow. The 51st and final issue of the journal was published in December 2005. In an editorial announcing the ending of BMJ USA, Kamerow and editor-in-chief of the BMJ Fiona Godlee stated that, despite its popularity, the journal \\"...has fallen victim to the widespread downturn in US pharmaceutical advertising and has become financially unsustainable for the BMJ Publishing Group.\\" BMJ USA contained more advertisements than the BMJ, and almost all of its subscriptions were \\"controlled\\", or paid for by pharmaceutical companies. After BMJ USA shuttered, Kamerow, who had been its editor-in-chief, transitioned to the role of the BMJs US editor. In January 2006, the BMJ started \\"US Highlights\\", an online-only feature intended to emulate BMJ USA by compiling articles from the BMJ that were deemed especially relevant to an American audience.

It replaced a 1st-century arkose temple on the same site, which was apparently too small to accommodate the many pilgrims who visited. Its remains were revealed by excavation campaigns in 1875 and at the turn of the century.  Archaeological History   Initial Discovery and Research  The temple and observatory, around 1900 The site was discovered in 1872 during the construction of a meteorological observatory. Very quickly, the first excavations took place between 1873 and 1878, conducted by The Academy of Sciences of Clermont-Ferrand, under Louis- Cl√©mentin Bruy√®re's direction in 1875. This initial research made it possible to conceive of the first site plans. The excavations were then stopped and the temple abandoned in that state. It was not until 1886 that steps were taken to protect it. It was classified as a historic monument in 1889. A number of later discoveries led to a second series of excavations, under the direction of Auguste Audollent and Gabriel Ruprich-Robert. This series of campaigns particularly studied the surroundings of the site and discovered a small annex temple as well as a small statuette of Mercury beside it, further confirming the dedication of the place of worship.  Modern Excavations  In 1956, the installation of a microwave relay located at the top of the dome, above the current temple, took place without preliminary excavations. The workers discovered scattered coins. Deterioration due to bad weather led to some consolidation and repair work, including a major restoration in 1978. Excavations did not resume intensively and regularly until 2000. These campaigns, carried out from 2000 to 2004 under the direction of Dominique Tardy and Jean-Louis Paillet, made it possible to complete a precise architectural survey, and modern excavation techniques have enabled significant advancements of knowledge about the site. The contributions of these campaigns were supplemented by the archaeological diagnosis carried out in 2008 prior to the tourist development of the site and its restoration.  Temple Restoration Project  A partial restoration project of the lower parts of the sanctuary was conceived in 2008 by the state and d√©partement. It was carried out in two phases, the first of which lasted until 2014 and involved the reconstruction of a part of a terrace supported by the surrounding wall. The second phase will include clearing the site's view of obstructions caused by materials left behind from 19th-century excavations. The purpose of the restoration was stated to be the preservation of the ruins, which are subject to harsh climactic conditions, as well as imparting a better appreciation for the scale and appearance of the temple in its original state.  Controversy  View of the ruins in 2005, prior to restoration Some critics have denounced the restoration project for concealing the original ruins. Fr√©d√©ric Tr√©ment, who excavated the site between 1999 and 2003, stated prior to the restoration that he was not consulted for the project and that, \\"the proposed reconstruction has the paradoxical consequence of making these ruins invisible behind an imposing and hideous Berlin Wall.\\" Dominique Tardy similarly disapproved of the project: > Neither the reading of the site, from the vestiges alone, remains very > obscure, nor the preservation of the authentic masonry - at least what > remained of it - finds favor in this massive reconstruction, which also > touches on the archaeological state of dismantling the edifice with > particular regard to its southeast corner. We wanted to do this so that > visitors understand better, but whether we go above or below, we no longer > see the processional system; the result: people will certainly not > understand more. The Temple   Chronology  Temple of Mercury - access to the first terrace (prior to restoration project) A first temple was built around 50 CE on the summit of Puy de D√¥me. Although objects dating from prior to the Roman conquest have been discovered, no trace of a pre-Roman building has been found. As such, the site may have been the subject of only temporary visitation without permanent construction. The 1st-century temple was destroyed around 150 CE and part of its materials used to build the second temple, lower on the slope, at an altitude around 1,435 meters. It is this temple which we can still see the remains of today. Coins discovered at the site indicates that it was still in use in the 4th and 5th centuries, but the structure could have been ruined by this time, perhaps by the 3rd Century, at the same time as the neighboring agglomeration of the Ceyssat Pass from which the path leads to the place of worship. In the 12th century, a Romanesque church, built on the summit of the dome, was inhabited by a hermit.  Description  Model of the remains under reconstruction Proposed reconstruction (although there is no remaining evidence of the temple's roof design). The 2nd-century temple was built on a strong terrace, a quadrilateral with 60 meter sides allowing it to compensate the slope of the ground descending from North to South. Its fa√ßade looked East towards the Limagne plain where Augustonemetum was located and, weather permitting, it could be seen from the city. The temple was built with local trachyte, assembled in large blocks for the visible parts, with filling made up of smaller trachyte blocks. The raw material was extracted near the Ceyssat pass, located at the foot of the Puy de D√¥me, but the decoration called on other types of stone with more distant origins‚Äîwhite and colored marbles for the pavements, Autun shales, and arkose column capitals, for example. Bronze was also used. Fragments of the paving are visible at the Bargoin museum in Clermont-Ferrand. In all, the building filled an area of around 3,600 m2. The actual plan of the temple was a hybrid, an intermediate between Celtic and Mediterranean traditions. Thus the sanctuary included a cella as found in the fana of Celtic tradition, fronted by a Mediterranean pronaos. This cella and pronaos ensemble was located at the top of a series of terraces, intended to punctuate and dramatize the visitor's journey. Thus the pilgrim, after a steep climb from the Ceyssat pass, and perhaps devotions made at the chapels along the path, would arrive upon a terrace that rose up in tiers and was occupied by altars and statues. From this theater, which could be used for specific ceremonies, the pilgrim would then take a passage that led to the eastern terrace overlooking Augustonemetum and the plain of Limagne. From there, one could access the pronaos and perform devotions in front of and around the cella. A gift might have been made to the god, which, if precious, would have been stored in the nearby treasure room of the temple, located between the two terraces. Dedication During the 1974 excavations, a small bronze tablet with dovetailed handles was discovered, bearing a dedication to imperial power and the god Mercury \\"Dumiatis\\". > NUM[inibus] AUG[ustorum] ET DEO MERCURI DUMIATI MATUTINIUS VICTORINUS This dedication is generally translated as: \\"In the name of Augustus and the god Mercury of The Dome, Matutinius Victorinus\\". Archaeologists have since attributed the sanctuary to the deities mentioned. This attribution was later reinforced by Auguste Audollent's discovery of a small Mercury statuette during his excavations in the early Twentieth Century. Other inscriptions, found in Germany and elsewhere, also express worship of the god Mercury, well- established in the city of Arverne. The votive altar of Miltenberg am Main invokes a Mercury Arvernorix, \\"king of the Arverni\\". Miltenberg (CIL 13, 6603) > MERCVRIO ARVERNORIC[I] COSSILLUS DONAVI ES VISV L(A)ETVS LIBE(N)S MERITO This dedication can be translated as: \\"To Mercury, king of the Arverni. Cossillus made this offering voluntarily after a dream.\\" Inscriptions from Cologne, Gripswald, Wenau, and Roermond more simply mention a Mercury \\"Arvernus\\". It is generally thought that these dedications are the result of Arvernian contingents within the Roman legion stationed on the Limes Germanicus. The dedications are a product of Gallo-Roman syncretism, meaning that - except during official Roman ceremonies, celebrated by expatriate settlers - the \\"Mercury\\" worshipped here was not identical with that of Rome. Zenodorus' Statue Pliny the Elder reported that a colossal bronze statue had been erected for an Arverni sanctuary by the sculptor Zenodorus. > But all the gigantic statues of this class have been beaten in our period by > Zenodorus with the Hermes or Mercury which he made in the community of the > Arverni in Gaul; it took him ten years and the sum paid for its making was > 40,000,000 sesterces. Having given sufficient proof of his artistic skill in > Gaul he was summoned to Rome by Nero, and there made the colossal statue, > 106 ft. high, intended to represent that emperor but now, dedicated to the > sun after the condemnation of that emperor's crimes, it is an object of awe. He does not specify whether the Zenodorus Mercury was erected in the sanctuary of Puy de D√¥me. If this was the case, no archaeological trace remains. However, the temple that can be seen today was built almost a century after the events reported by Pliny the Elder. According to the hypothesis where Zenodorus' statue was actually there, it could have been erected with the first temple, whose archaeological vestiges were largely destroyed during the construction of the microwave relay in 1956. There are arguments to place the erection of the Greek sculptor's work at the summit. First, the fact that the construction of the original temple and the creation of the statue are contemporary. The first temple dates from the middle of the 1st century. Zenodorus stayed in Gaul before working on the colossus of Nero which would adorn the Domus Aurea before its transfer to the Colosseum. The second argument that can be used is that of visibility. The colossal statue would have been almost as visible from the surrounding area as the microwave relay is today. This visibility made it possible to identify the sacred mount of the god and made it possible to evoke that this one, one of whose theonyms is Arvernorix, \\"king of the Arverni\\", thus watched over his people. Vasso Galate There has been some debate over whether an Arverni temple, which Gregory of Tours in his Historia Francorum called Vasso Galate, could be in reference to the Temple of Mercury at Puy de D√¥me. Gregory describes it briefly without, however, mentioning its location. It is generally considered, since the work of Pierre-Fran√ßois Fournier that the Vasso Galate is the temple located at rue Rameau in Clermont-Ferrand and whose vestiges are also called Mur des Saracens or \\"Temple of Jaude\\". Counter to this, Auguste Audollent thought that the sanctuary mentioned by Gregory of Tours was that at Puy de D√¥me. He was also surprised at the persistence of attendance in a supposedly destroyed temple. The confusion comes in part from the expression veniens vero arvernus which can be translated as \\"Coming to Auvernis\\" or \\"Coming to Clermont\\" (at the time of Gregory of Tours, Clermont-Ferrand was called Arvernis). The term \\"Jaude\\" designating the district where the Clermont ruins are found would be related to \\"Galate\\" via a Medieval form \\"Jalde\\". However it has also been argued that the Bishop of Tours' description of the Vasso Galate seems to agree better with the plan and ornamentation of the Puy de D√¥me sanctuary. But on the other hand, the design of the temple of Clermont remains generally poorly known. Another consideration, is a dedication to Mercury found in Germany which invokes the theonym Vassocaleti. Many authors have connected this epithet to Gregory's term for the temple. The two temples are contemporary, with the Clermont site having produced coins dating from the reign of Augustus. And if the dedication of the sanctuary of Clermont remains unknown, there is consensus for considering the temple to be located at rue Rameau.  The Temple's Surroundings  The Ceyssat Pass The Puy de D√¥me sanctuary was serviced by a path that started from the Roman road linking Lugdunum (Lyon) to Mediolanum Santonum (Saintes), at the level of the Ceyssat Pass. There was a secondary town with at least one temple allowing the traveler in a hurry to fulfill their devotion to Mercury without having to climb to the top. A building acting as a road relay is also suspected. There are also traces of an artisanal district around the trachyte quarry which supplied the summit temple with the stone necessary for its construction. Finally, a funerary area is nearby. This secondary agglomeration fully participates in the sacralization of the mount, the road which leads to the sanctuary being dotted with temples, at the foot of the volcano, with the temple of the Tourette d'Enval in Orcines, passing through those, intermediate, from the Ceyssat Pass to the summit temple. Augustonemetum Other Cult Sites in the City of the Arverni Stele from Orcines with a relief of Mercury. Temple of Mercury complex, 2nd century CE. The very name of the Arverni capital in Roman times, Augustonemetum, \\"Sanctuary of Augustus\\", suggests the presence of an imperial cult within the city. This imperial cult, however, did not leave any tangible traces and the only sanctuary attested is that whose remains are called Mur des Saracens, located at rue Rameau in Clermont-Ferrand and identified, without the debate being settled, as the Vasso Galate mentioned by Gregory of Tours. Augustonemetum had, however, a certain number of peri-urban sanctuaries, of various importance, such as the sanctuary of Source des Roches in Chamali√®res, whose activity did not reach the 1st century CE; the temple des C√¥tes in Blanzat, discovered by P. Eychart in the 1950s; that of Tr√©monteix, a private sanctuary linked to an ancient domain, discovered in 2012; or the Fanum of Brezet nearby Aulnat. One of these sanctuaries, the Tourette d'Enval temple in Orcines can be directly associated with the cult complex formed by the Puy de D√¥me sanctuary and the agglomeration of the Ceyssat Pass. Dedicated to Mercury, it marks the beginning of the ascent of the mountain. A wider circle around Puy de D√¥me also includes the sanctuaries of the Corent and Gergovie oppida, the first dating back to the 2nd century BCE and which remained active until the 3rd century CE, the second dating from the Augustan Age. A third fanum, that of La Sauvetat, below Puy de Corent to the south, can also be mentioned. Finally, on the same ancient route as the agglomeration of the Ceyssat Pass, but located near the Lemovices border, was a secondary agglomeration provided with a sanctuary excavated in 1882 and in the 1950s. This sanctuary, the site of Beauclair, on the territory of the municipalities of Giat and Voingt, produced graffiti naming the god Toutatis.

He was the founder of the avant-garde movement Zenitism and its magazine Zenit. Both he and his brother, Branko Ve Poljanski became prominent avant-garde artists. Biography He studied philosophy at University of Zagreb. He founded the review Zenit, set up a Zenit Gallery and published his own writings and other authors under the Zenit imprint.Zenit was active from February 1921 until April 1924 in Zagreb, and afterward in Belgrade from 1924 until late 1926 with a total of 43 editions. The first artist to collaborate with Miciƒá and to contribute to Zenit's orientation towards Expressionism was Vilko Gecan. Miciƒá's Zenitism was supported by a small number of younger Yugoslav artists, namely Mihajlo Petrov, Vasa Pomori≈°ac, Jovan Bijeliƒá, Petar Dobroviƒá, Ivan Radoviƒá. Miciƒá worked on collecting and exhibiting avant-garde art in Zenit editorial offices in Zagreb and Belgrade, and he organized Zenit international exhibitions of new art in Belgrade in 1924. Miciƒá initially followed expressionistic ideas, which can be seen in the introductory text of the first Zenit, and in texts of authors including Milo≈° Crnjanski, Stanislav Vinaver, Rastko Petroviƒá and Du≈°an Matiƒá. Besides Serbian authors, international writers contributed in more than five languages, including Esperanto. The magazine established ties with Futurists, including Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Joined by Ivan Galom and Bo≈°ko Tokin, he published the \\"Manifesto of Zenitism\\" in which they stated their ideas and ideology. Beside clear contradictions in their statements, Zenitists placed humans in the center of their attention and advocated antitraditionalism, antimilitarism and reaching out to new media and art forms such as radio, film, and jazz. After closing Zenit, he moved to Paris, where he lived from 1927-1936. Inspired by the Russian avant-garde, Miciƒá favored the Constructivist view on creativity, denying inspiration as a term in favor of work, with a clear goal in mind. Shortly after abandoning expressionistic ideas, Miciƒá coined the idea of Barbarogenije, proposing Balkanisation and barbarisation of Europe. His ideas in favor of primitive and folk art came after World War I and general disappointment in the culture of Western Europe. Miciƒá considered the Balkans to be an unexplored area that could offer freshness and honesty. He was also highly critical of the total value of alleged \\"great\\" Croatian culture which he considered to be inferior compared next to Serbian culture. Legacy His work was almost forgotten after World War II. After his death, a collection of art and documentation of his publishing activities were found in his apartment, thus stimulating fresh research into the history and aesthetics of Zenitism. Miciƒá's possessions, including a number of paintings, collages, drawings, books, and magazines were given to the National Museum of Serbia in 1980 and today they are a part of the permanent exhibition.

A successful fast ship, she was later operated on services on the South Coast of England and in the Bristol Channel Description Water Witch was launched on 6 August 1835 by George Graham in the former Royal Naval Dockyard at Harwich, Essex,Water Witch was sometimes referred to as \\"government-built\\", presumably on the basis of being built in a former naval dockyard. completed her final outfitting on the River Thames, and arrived at Dover on 24 September 1835. She initially measured 89 tons burthen and the hull was long, in beam and deep.As a consequence of changes in regulations she was later measured as 130GRT, 74NRT, with dimensions x x She was engined with a 2-cylinder beam engine, made by Maudslay, Sons and Field at Lambeth, of 80 horse power and driving two side paddle wheels. Service from Kent ports The steamer was owned by John Hayward of Dover and others, including her builder George Graham, and captained by William Hayward. The Haywards were the first private operator of steam vessels from Dover, beginning with Sovereign in 1822. Built specifically for the steam packet services from Dover to London and to Boulogne, Water Witch proved to be a fast vessel, beating both British Post Office packet steamers and French state vessels in speed trials. Initially she was partnered on the London service by the steamer Dover Castle under Capt. Luckhurst, and on sailings to Boulogne by Royal George under Capt. Swaffer, but by 1837 was fully dedicated to the Boulogne route. On 24 June 1843, with the South Eastern Railway Company's line from London having reached Folkestone, Water Witch was specially chartered from Capt. Hayward for a trial trip by its directors and engineer, together with their guests, of a steam ferry service from Folkestone Harbour (which the company had purchased) to Boulogne. The voyage was successful, and demonstrated that a day trip to France from London was possible. Although the subsequent public services were run by ships of the New Commercial Steam Packet Company, when that company withdrew its ships in February 1844, Haywards' Water Witch and Royal George were chartered to fill the gap for ten months. Poole-Portsmouth steam packet In early 1845 Haywards sold Water Witch to the short-lived Poole, Isle of Purbeck, Isle of Wight and Portsmouth Steam Packet Company, and she was re-registered at Poole on 31 May 1845. She was put on a twice-weekly service between Poole and Portsmouth, with calls at Brownsea Island, South Haven, Yarmouth and Cowes. In addition to the packet service, she was used as a tug to assist larger vessels entering and leaving Poole. The opening of the Southampton and Dorchester Railway in 1847 had an adverse effect on demand from passengers and for freight and they consequently looked for alternative trades for Water Witch, their only vessel; one possibility was a service between Poole and the Channel Islands. By mid-1848 other possibilities had not materialised and Water Witch was offered for sale, though a buyer was not found until the end of the year. Bristol Channel services Water Witch began a new service for the Bideford-based North Devon Steam Packet Company in February 1849, connecting Bideford and Barnstaple with Bristol through separate weekly services to each Devon port; calls were also made at Ilfracombe and Lynmouth, and the sailings were timed to connect with the Liverpool steamers at Bristol. In September 1851, after a period offering free return passages to customers making their way to the Great Exhibition in London, the ship was advertised for sale by auction, and then again in December when her North Devon sailings had ended. She was next offered for sale in early 1853, still at Bideford, but with no indication that she had been active in 1852. On 12 January 1857 Water Witch, after extensive repairs and with new boilers, commenced a freight service between Gloucester and Bideford, via Swansea as well as offering towage services to Bristol Channel ports.

It has been Grade II listed since 1970. A similar statue stands at Gordon Reserve, near Parliament House in Melbourne, Australia, on its original tall plinth. A different memorial statue by Edward Onslow Ford, depicting Gordon on a camel, stands at Brompton Barracks, Chatham, with another formerly in Khartoum and now at Gordon's School near Woking. There are further memorial statues to Gordon in Aberdeen; in Gravesham, where the full length stone statue depicts Gordon in his army uniform with a sabre; and there is a Grade II listed monument to Gordon in Southampton. Background Major-General Gordon was lionised as a British war hero after his death at the end of the Siege of Khartoum in January 1885. The statue was made in 1887-88. Gordon's brother, Sir Henry Gordon, advised Thornycroft to minimise the military character of the statue, and emphasis Gordons qualities of strength of mind, love, kindness and affection. The original statue in London was first unveiled in Trafalgar Square on 16 October 1888 without a formal ceremony. It was sited halfway between the two fountains in Trafalgar Square, standing on a high pedestal. The statue was removed from Trafalgar Square in 1943 and moved to the grounds of Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire. In a speech in the House of Commons speech 5 May 1948, Winston Churchill (then Leader of the Opposition) advocated a return of the statue to its original location. In the event, it was reinstalled on a lower plinth in 1953, about half a mile to the southeast, on the Victoria Embankment, between the new Ministry of Defence building and the River Thames, just south of Horse Guards Avenue. Description of the London statue The larger than life size statue depicts the British Army officer Charles George Gordon standing in his army uniform, carrying a cane and a bible, with his head resting on his raised right hand, and his left foot resting on a broken cannon. The plinth of Portland stone bears inscriptions and two bronze plaques, one on each side. The main inscription in the stone on the front of the plinth reads: \\"CHARLES G. GORDON C.B. / MAJOR-GEN. ROYAL ENGINEERS // KILLED AT KHARTOUM / XXVI JANUARY / MDCCCLXXXV\\". Further inscriptions on the stone plinth list his actions, clockwise from the south front: \\"CRIMEA 1855 N CHINA 1864 / QUINSAN SOOCHOW / SOUDAN KHARTOUM / GRAVESEND EQUATOR\\". These inscriptions record his service in the Crimean War; at Quinsan and Soochow during the Taiping Rebellion while leading the Ever Victorious Army; at Gravesend while commanding the Royal Engineers building defences along the River Thames; and in Equatoria (southern Sudan), in Soudan and at Khartoum. The bronze plaques on either side of the plinth depict pairs of allegorical figures in relief, identified by further stone inscriptions, as \\"FORTITUDE\\" (with shield and sword) alongside \\"FAITH\\" (hooded), and \\"CHARITY\\" (with two children) alongside \\"JUSTICE\\" (blindfold, with scales and sword). The shield of Fortitude bears the legend \\"RIGHT / FEARS NO / MIGHT\\". Other statues An identical statue by Thornycroft was installed in 1889 at Gordon Reserve in Melbourne, Australia, on the triangle between Macarthur Street and Spring Street to the south of Parliament House, facing towards the Old Treasury Building. It still stands on its original tall pedestal, which bears scenes from Gordon's life. A different memorial statue by Edward Onslow Ford, depicting Gordon on a camel, stands at Brompton Barracks, Chatham, the home of the Royal School of Military Engineering. It became Grade II* listed in 1998. A second cast of Ford's statue of Gordon on a camel was installed in Khartoum from 1904 until 1958. Shortly after Sudan achieved its independence, the statue was removed and reinstalled at Gordon's School, near Woking, in 1959, where it has a Grade II listing. Further memorial statues to Gordon stand in Aberdeen; in Gravesham, where the full length stone statue depicts Gordon in his army uniform with a sabre; and there is a Grade II listed monument in Southampton.

Overview New India was a newspaper founded as a means to spread news related to the Indian freedom struggle, and as a means to vocalize the views of its founder, the freedom fighter Dr. Annie Besant, through her editorials. It was in the same league as Gandhi's Harijan and Tilak's Kesari. History Annie Besant was a London born half Irish half English, pro workers union, pro Irish freedom person who happened to first come to India in November 1893. She had helped start the first trade unions in London, was a member of the Fabian Society and a close associate of a number of socialists of her time including Sydney Webbs, George Bernard Shaw, George Lansbury and Ramsay MacDonald. In 1866, she read two theosophical books written by Mr A. P. Sinnet, and in 1889 read Mme H. P. Blavatsky's ‚ÄòThe Secret Doctrine‚Äô. These influenced her greatly and she came to India. In May 1889, Besant joined the Theosophical Society in Madras, and became Blavatsky's pupil and helper. She gradually became a prominent worker of the Theosophical Society and was elected President, a position that she held till her death in September 1933. In October 1913, Besant spoke at a public meeting in Madras recommending that there should be a Standing Committee of the House of Commons for Indian affairs which would go into the question of how India might attain freedom. Realising that a newspaper would help propagate her political thoughts, she founded a weekly newspaper in January 1914. In June 1914 she purchased an existing newspaper called 'Madras Standard' and renamed it 'New India'. The New India subsequently became her chosen organ for her tempestuous propaganda for India's freedom, and was widely read by the English educated Indian middle and upper classes, post world war when the Indian freedom struggle was beginning to gather momentum. Activities and Political stance New India was a pro Indian freedom newspaper, which simultaneously worked as a mouthpiece for the views of its founder Dr. Annie Besant. During and after the First world war, the return to Gandhi to India, the involvement of Indian masses in the Indian freedom struggle (which till then had generally remained a topic of discussion only for the English speaking upper class Indians) and the vociferous involvement of Bipin Chandra Pal, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru and others, the Indian freedom struggle began to gather momentum in places other than Delhi, Calcutta and Bombay. In 1914, Besant vocalized the idea of the inclusion of more Indians in making decisions related to India at a political and economic level. She called this freedom 'Home Rule', similar to the home rule movement in Ireland. She egan to be active in the Indian National Congress, as a delegate as well as a member of various committees. In 1915, in a meeting in Bombay, she explained her plan for the establishment of the Home Rule League. This work intensified in 1916, as people began to eagerly read the 'New India' for news of the progress of the Indian freedom movement and to read Dr Besant's editorials in the paper. At that time, popular English newspapers like The Times of India used to usually publish pro-British news to cater to its primarily pro colonial advertisers and readers. Hence there was an urgent need to have English language newspapers that could publish news related to the Indian freedom struggle and the people involved in it. New India's readers thus consisted mainly of the educated English speaking middle and upper class Indians as well as foreigners sympathetic to the cause of India's freedom. Besant started the Home Rule League was on 1 September 1916, announcing it in New India. Bal Gangadhar Tilak too had formed a similar Home League. Due to its danger to the British empire, Tilak was exiled and in June 1917, Besant was interned in Ootacamund with two principal workers G. S. Arundale and B. P. Wadia, thus interrupting the publishing of New India. However, due to widescale protests all over India and abroad, the internment order was withdrawn, and in August 1917 Besant was made the President of the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress. As a result of her campaign and because of the pressure of public opinion in India, the Montagu - Chelmsford proposals were enacted by the British Parliament which created a few nominal openings for Indians in certain local councils. However, Besant favoured changing laws to encourage the participation of Indians in the governance of India, and did not favour the breaking of laws set by the British administration. Thus, when 1920 Gandhi launched Satyagraha in 1920 in Lahore, Besant stood against it. A lifetime of fighting by constitutional means and within the law had left her with a deep distrust of massive law - breaking in whatever cause it might be. Again, New India became a mode through which Besant could vocalize her justification of her views. Gradually, as Besant held on to views opposed tot eh general sway of public, her popularity and New India's popularity waned. However, her creative work for India continued, mostly reflected in her writings in New India. Between 1922 and 1924, in consultation with her colleagues Tej Bahadur Sapru, C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, P. S. Sivaswami Aiyar, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, Purshottamdas Thakurdas and Hari Singh Gour, most of them knights of the British empire who advocated more participation of Indians in the existing British colonial order, she drafted the \\"Commonwealth of India Bill\\" which was presented in the Parliament in London by George Lansbury in December 1925. Parts of it were published in New India, however it did not go beyond the first reading stage.

The $867 billion reconciled farm bill was passed by the Senate on December 11, 2018, and by the House on December 12. Issue is becoming an early plank of the Kentucky Republican's 2020 re- election bid On December 20, 2018, it received President Donald Trump's signature and became law. History On May 18, 2018, the $867 billion farm bill failed in the House of Representatives with a vote of 198 yea to 213 nay. All Democrats and 30 Republicans voted against the measure. Republican opposition came largely from the Freedom Caucus who disagreed with its provisions that would liberalize immigration policy. Jim Jordan, a Freedom Caucus member said \\"My main focus was making sure we do immigration policy right.\\" Democratic opposition was largely due to the proposed changes to the attached Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that would impose work requirements. On September 30, some provisions of the 2014 farm bill expired without a replacement while others were funded through end of calendar year 2018. Sticking points were said to be SNAP work requirements, commodity and energy policy, funding, and cotton and other crop subsidies. In late November, a compromise had been reached, removing SNAP work requirements, and the legislation was voted on and passed by the end of the year. Provisions The bill \\"largely continues current farm and nutrition policy\\", and does not include new requirements for SNAP (food stamps) recipients, but did increase funding for the SNAP Employment and Training Program. The bill also reauthorized Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and other nutrition programs.Aussenberg, Randy Alison; Billings, Kara Clifford (January 30, 2019), 2018 Farm Bill Primer: SNAP and Nutrition Title Programs, Congressional Research Service The 2018 Farm Bill also increased funding for TEFAP and the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grant program. Some previously temporary programs were made permanent in the 2018 farm bill including promotional funds for farmers markets, organic farming research funds, funding of organizing and education of future farmers, and funding for veteran and minority farmers. Incorporating some of the text of the Hemp Farming Act of 2018, the farm bill descheduled some cannabis products from the Controlled Substances Act for the first time. One estimate put the U.S. CBD market at $2.3 billion to $23 billion by the 2020s, enabled by the 2018 farm bill. U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell was such a proponent of the hemp provision that American Military News reported that McConnell coined the hashtag #HempFarmBill The 2018 Farm Bill establishes a new federal hemp regulatory system under the US Department of Agriculture which aims to facilitate the commercial cultivation, processing, and marketing of hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill removes hemp and hemp seeds from the statutory definition of marijuana and the DEA schedule of Controlled Substances. It even makes hemp an eligible crop under the federal crop insurance program. The 2018 Farm Bill also allows the transfer of hemp and hemp-derived products across state lines provided the hemp was lawfully produced under a State or Indian Tribal plan or under a license issued under the USDA plan. Additional revenue to farmers and processors is expected from textiles and other hemp products. The Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act of 2018 was passed as part of the bill.

The Salon d'Or, Homburg, 1871. Rhode Island School of Design Museum Le Tapis Vert (Gambing at Baden-Baden), 1883 engraving by William Ridgway, after an 1867 painting by Gustave Dor√© Salon D'Or, Homburg, is an 1871 oil painting by William Powell Frith. It is held by the Rhode Island School of Design Museum in Providence, Rhode Island. The painting measures . It depicts an interior scene at the , run by the twin brothers Fran√ßois Blanc and Louis Blanc who would later run the Monte Carlo Casino. Frith visited Bad Homburg in 1869 with a friend, O'Neil. The popular casino near Frankfurt was due to close in 1871 when its 30-year lease expired. Frith was following several contemporaneous works of art and literature which had focussed on gambling and casinos, including artworks such as Alfred Elmore's 1865 On the Brink and Gustave Dor√©'s 1867 Le Tapis Vert, and literary works such as Anthony Trollope's 1864 Can You Forgive Her? and Feodor Dostoyevsky's 1869 The Gambler. Frith used photography to capture the scene, and made many preparatory drawings and sketches to establish the final composition. The central figure is a woman in grey, turning away from the tables with blank expression, apparently having lost heavily. A man and a woman to her right look on unapprovingly: portraits of Frith and his wife. He used a landscape format to show the crowds of fashionable people around the gambling tables. His depiction include his typically characterful vignettes, but there are some differences between his final sketch and the completed work. For example, in the sketch, an older man seated in the left foreground gives some money from his winnings to his mistress; in the oil painting, a younger man is seeking more money from his wife so he can keep playing. The completed painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition at Burlington House in 1871, with the subtitle \\"Le jeu est fait - Rien ne va plus\\" (French: \\"The stakes are set ‚Äì No more bets\\"). It received mixed reviews - some critics preferred the repulsive realism of Dor√©, but Frith's work became so popular with the viewing public that a barrier was erected to keep back the crowd ‚Äì an accolade rarely accorded: the previous two instances were Frith's The Derby Day in 1858, and David Wilkie's Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch in 1822. It was also exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. Frith then embarked on a Hogarthian series of paintings on moral subjects, The Road to Ruin, which follows the descending path of a wealthy young gentleman who becomes embroiled in gambling and loses his fortune. This series needed another rail when exhibited at the Royal Academy, also in 1878. Frith had sold Salon D'Or to the art dealer Louis Victor Flatow in 1870 for ¬£4,000, including the copyright. Flatow had the work engraved by the printmaker Charles George Lewis, but Frith was unhappy with the quality of the resulting prints when they were published from 1876. Flatow sold the painting in 1874 for ¬£1,995, without the reproduction rights. Victorian paintings became deeply unfashionable in the early 20th century, and it was auctioned at Christie's in 1932 for just ¬£48 6s, sold to Walter Lowry of New York. He later donated it to the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. A smaller version was acquired by the National Gallery of Canada in 1964.

It is one of many caves investigated or discovered by Philippe- Charles Schmerling, in 1831; the cave is named for a later researcher, Sir Charles Lyell, who visited the cave in 1860. With the Ros√©e Cave it is classified as an since 8 July 1988, and is accessible only to scientific researchers. The cave's troglofauna includes Belgium's only cave-inhabiting beetle, '.  Location The Lyell Cave is located in √âhein on the edge of the valley of Engihoul, where the stream named Engihoul runs by the route des 36 tournants, in a syncline formed during the Vis√©an, near the \\"Lion's quarry\\".  Name Portrait of Charles Lyell Philippe-Charles Schmerling wrote of his searches in the \\"caves of Engihoul\\" in his book Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles d√©couverts dans les cavernes de la province de Li√®ge, which was published two years after his exploration of the place. In 1833 he met geologist Charles Lyell, who was passing through Li√®ge, and told him of his theories about prehistoric humans. Lyell was interested enough to mention them in his Principes de g√©ologie the following year, but without giving it the importance he would assign it later. In 1860 Lyell returned to Li√®ge and decided to examine the \\"caverne d'Engihoul\\" with the help of the Belgian professor Constantin Malaise, from the Institut agricole de l'√âtat who got him to explore a cave different from Schmerling's. In honor of that visit, the cave was renamed \\"Lyell Cave\\" in the 20th century, from \\"Grande Caverne d‚ÄôEngihoul\\" as it was called in Les Cavernes et les rivi√®res souterraines de la Belgique by E. Van den Broeck, √â.-A. Martel and Ed. Rahir.E. Van den Broeck, E.-A. Martel, and Ed.

Lamertin, Bruxelles, 1910, p. 45 of the addenda.  Description  According to the 1910 description, there are two entrances: the one west, marked B on the map, consists of two couloirs, one of which is closed because the quarry's explosives were stored there. The other, marked A, is in the east, at the bottom of the rocky wall of the ravine of Engihoul, 13m from the Meuse. Very narrow and difficult to enter, this passage has been widened and leveled. Longitudinal map of the Lyell Cave (or Grande Caverne d'Engihoul), from E. Van den Broeck, √â.-A. Martel, and Ed.

Lamertin, Bruxelles, 1910. From west to east, there are five halls, connected via narrow passages: # is the deepest, 10m below the entrance, measuring 10m by 9m; # the Hall of the moon, 8m by 3m, a name given by Doudou, because of light entering through a joint in the ceiling; # the Hall of Nutons, 4m by 3m, part of which is the gallery containing stalactites, which rises toward the west and is obscured by concretions; # the Hall of the Cone, 14m by 3m, named for a cone on the ceiling; # the Grand Hall, 20m by 18m, and 4m high, with two oblique chimneys containing layers of sediment full of bones. These are most likely the remains of some sixty bears and fifty boars, which were collected there by water running through the cave.  Subsequent research Philippe-Charles Schmerling Professor Joseph Antoine Spring, of the University of Li√®ge, visited the cave in 1853, before Charles Lyell and Constantin Malaise did in 1860.. Malaise exhumed fragments of human skulls that were later studied by E.-T. Hamy. De Puygt and Lohest, members of the Anthropological Society of Brussels, found Neolithic engravings made with silex. In 1894, paleontology professor Julien Fraipont of the University of Li√®ge found animal bones and tools made of silex. The site has also been pilfered by private individuals for their personal collections. In the 1890s, Ernest Doudou found new cavities containing human and animal remains, sharpened tools of silex, pottery fragments, bones that had been worked on, bronze and iron objects, traces of ancient fires, from different eras. He concluded that the cave was occupied from the Paleolithic to the Middle Ages; most of these objects were deposited at the University of Li√®ge.  Exceptional patrimony classification  With the Ros√©e Cave, with which it forms a single system, it is classified as an since 8 July 1988.Fiche de la R√©gion wallonne It is accessible only to scientific researchers, since access by tourists and amateur speleologists risks upsetting the biotope's natural balance with changes to temperature and light, walking through the clay, and the import of nutritional elements that favor certain organisms. The entrance was closed after the cave was filmed. The cave was owned in the past by the Carmeuse company, which transferred its ownership in 1999 to the non-profit Les Chercheurs de la Wallonie.  Biological importance  The Lyell Cave is relatively uninteresting from the point of view of paleontology, but has interesting biodiversity, as evidenced by 20th-c biospeleologists including Robert Leruth. They have verified many invertebrates some of which were considered endemic to this cave: * ', found later also in a German cave; * ', discovered in the 1940s, and found afterward, in 1998, in the grotte Nicole in Fl√©malle, a recently developed troglobite since it still has minuscule eyes. The Diplura ', discovered in June 1999, was thought to be endemic until June 2000. Also found were: * Porrhomma microphthalmum, a spider; * Schellencandona triquetra, an ostracod; * Niphargus fontanus, an amphipoda; * ', a springtail; * Plutomurus unidentatus, a springtail; * Lengersdorfia flabellata, a fly.

Hizbul Muslimin was also the first Islamist political party of Malaya set-up to fight for the independence from the British colonization.Sejarah Perjuangan PAS 1951-1970 Formation In March 1947, the first Pan-Malayan Islamic conference was held at Madrasah Ma'ahad al-Ehya as-Sharif, Gunung Semanggol, Perak. The conference was organized by the Parti Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM) led by Dr. Burhanuddin al-Helmy to discuss the economy problem faced by the Malay-Muslim. It aim to bring together the Islamic thinkers and movements to be more politically active and progressive. As a result, the Supreme Religious Council of Malaya or Majlis Agama Tertinggi Malaya (MATA) was formed. MATA organised a political conference from 13‚Äì16 March 1948 discussing local and international issues concerning the community. The conference participants felt United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) did not do enough to present the important issues and the conservative-nationalist also did not do their parts for the Malay-Muslim sake. The UMNO representatives were dissatisfied with the Islamist in MATA who were more revolutionist and militant. The UMNO representatives reported to UMNO leader Dato' Onn Jaafar who gave the warning of \\"the dangerous threat from the mountain\\" (\\"ancaman bahaya dari gunung\\"), referring to Gunung Semanggol, the location of MATA movement. Eventually the Parti Orang Muslimin Malaya or Hizbul Muslimin was formed on 17 March 1948 led by Ustaz Abu Bakar al-Baqir after the second MATA conference which declared for MATA to be arranged back as an Islamic political party. With the formation of Hizbul Muslimin, all political activities was transferred to the new party. MATA would be the party's religious affairs bureau. However, Hizbul Muslimin existed not for long when it was banned by the British government by claiming it having relation with the illegal Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). The approval of Emergency Ordinance 1948 had caused Hizbul Muslimin to be considered as dangerous and out-law. It ceased to exist after several of its leaders were arrested during the Malayan Emergency. Dissolution and aftermath Many members of Hizbul Muslimin escaped from British actions by joining UMNO.

Shortly after her launch a French privateer captured her but the British Royal Navy quickly recaptured her. Her recapture gave rise to a court case. In 1815 she successfully repelled an American privateer in a notable single-ship action. She continued to serve the Post Office until 1826 when she was sold. She was wrecked in 1826. Career Hill & Melish built Walsingham for the Post Office as a Postal Packet. However, the vessel's masters owned and managed her. During her career she sailed where the Post Office sent her, including Portugal, Brazil, North America, Jamaica, Malta, and elsewhere. On 26 September 1795 Porcupine and recaptured Walsingham Packet. The French corvette brig Insolent, of 18 guns and 90 men, had captured Walsingham Packet on 13 September as Walsingham Packet, Bell, master, was sailing from Falmouth to Lisbon.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2756. Insolent narrowly escaped being herself captured at the recapture of Walsingham Packet, getting into Lorient as the British ships came into range. Walsingham Packet had a cargo on board at the time of her capture. The British and Portuguese owners of the cargo claimed it. However, her captors disputed their claim to the cargo, pointing out that it was illegal for packets to engage in commercial trade. Justice Sir William Scott (Baron Stowell), of the High Court of Admiralty, rejected the cargo owners' claim, but left open the question of to whom the cargo would be condemned. Lloyd's List reported on 27 November 1807 that Walsingham Packet had arrived at Falmouth with the mails for Lisbon. She had left Lisbon on the 4th after shore batteries on the Tagus River.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4207. On 22 October the government in Portugal had published a proclamation closing all Portugal's ports to British vessels, whether naval or commercial. The proclamation was in response to Napoleon's demands as he implemented the Continental System. Mr. Chamberlain, the Post Office's agent at Lisbon, dispatched the proclamation on the 27th. Anticipating the expulsion or even arrest of all British residents from Portugal, he hired a small armed schooner to stand off the coast, awaiting his arrival. On 11 November the Portuguese government decided to arrest all British subjects, except the ambassador and his staff. Chamberlain made his way to the coast on foot, only to discover that the schooner had departed. He tried to reach some of the British vessels that were off the coast, but the surf prevented him from reaching them. He was able to reach Walsingham, which the shore batteries had fired on the day before, and which was standing off the coast trying to ascertain what was happening. With Chamberlain's arrival and his report, Walsingham had its answer and she departed for Falmouth. In 1813 Lloyd's Register started to list the Falmouth packets. It showed Walsingham with Roberts, owner, changing to Bullock. Her owner was Captain and Co.Lloyd's Register (1813), \\"Falmouth Packets\\", Seq.‚Ññ38. On 11 February 1815,Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Report (1893), p.40. Walsingham was 100 miles to windward was on her way to Jamaica, and under the temporary command of Captain William Nichols. She sighted a schooner that outsailed Walsingham and bore up and hoisted a British blue ensign. Nichols was not deceived and prepared his guns, moving two 9-pounders to the stern to act as stern chasers. As the schooner came up it was clear that she was American, armed with twelve long 9-pounder guns, and that her forecastle was packed with men in preparation for boarding Walsingham. The two vessels exchanged broadsides for half an hour. The American's masts and rigging were badly damaged and the British considered attempting to capture their assailant, but she was able none the less to sail off. Walsingham had five men wounded. When she arrived at Jamaica the local merchants raised some ¬£500 to award Nichols with an honour sword and to reward his crew. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars the packets were put on a peacetime establishment with respect to their armament and manning. Walsingham last appeared in the Lloyd's Registers list of Falmouth packets in 1825 with J. Bullock as master and owner.Lloyd's Register (1825), \\"Falmouth Packets\\", Seq.‚Ññ32.

It was designed by Henry Dangar and built from 1827 to 1888, with William Dangar supervising much of the initial construction. What remains of the original property include a two storied brick homestead and associated western wing, the original carriage house and stables building, a meat store, and the remains of a greenhouse. The property includes a ballroom, servants' quarters, gentlemen's parlour, breakfast room and guest reception room, and sits on a 9.71 hectares block fronting onto the Hunter River. The gates and gate house/lodge survive but are no longer part of the Neotsfield property. The eastern wing has been demolished, and the front balcony and verandah roofs are missing. The main building has \\"lost its face\\" and its original proportions. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Henry Dangar Henry Dangar (1796-1861) was eldest of six brothers, descendants of an old Jersey (Channel Islands) family.Wilberforce et al., 1927 Henry was born at St Neot, Cornwall, son of William Dangar and wife Judith. He was the first of six brothers to emigrate as free settlers to New South Wales. Henry arrived on the \\"Jessie\\" on 2 April 1821 and soon after arrival was appointed by Governor Macquarie as assistant in the Survey Department and employed in the counties of Camden and Argyle.Gray, 1966 The well-known Dangar was one of the Government surveyors who, with Surveyor Finch, surveyed the Counties of Northumberland and Durham in the Hunter Valley. Dangar was rewarded for his service when Governor Macquarie granted him 700 acres in the Hunter Valley between Morpeth and Raymond Terrace on 6 September 1821. When Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane began preparations early in 1822 for the free settlement of the Hunter River districts, Dangar was transferred to Newcastle to make a detailed and immediate survey of the valley, which was believed to extend only about 25 miles (40 km) to the north. He prepared the plans of King's Town (Newcastle) and in the next 2 years measured and marked out village reserves, church lands and allocations for settlers along the lower branches of the Hunter River and as far north as Patrick's Plains, furnishing in 1823 a detailed and valuable \\"Return of Land Cleared and Other Improvements made by Small Settlers\\". Early in 1824 Colonel James Morisset, commandant at Newcastle, complained that Dangar was paying too much attention to his own 700 acre (283ha) grant and too little to his official duties, whereupon Surveyor- General John Oxley ordered his transfer to another district. The order was withdrawn and for the next year Dangar toiled almost unceasingly, marking the road from Newcastle to Wallis Plains (Maitland), measuring reserves and grants and working steadily northwards until he reached the hitherto unsettled upper districts of the Hunter River. In July 1824 he named Fal and Foy Brooks, in August explored the present sites of Muswellbrook, Aberdeen and Scone, crossed the Hunter and discovered and named Kingdon Ponds and Dartbrook. Soon afterwards he arranged an expedition to ascertain \\"the nature and point of junction of the stream from the westward\\" which he had observed on his earlier journey up the Hunter. Accompanied by John Richards and two servants, Dangar discovered in October 1824 the confluence of the Goulburn and Hunter Rivers, explored Dartbrook to its head where Allan Cunningham had crossed it in 1823, named Lamorran Brook (Wybong) and crossed the Liverpool Range to the plains beyond. Cornish place names, scattered through the Hunter Valley, mark Henry Dangar's surveys and record his deep affection for his birthplace. Mount Dangar, Dangarfield and Dangarsleigh commemorate his name. His finest memorial however, was the proud boast of his employees, and their children and grandchildren, that they were \\"Dangar men\\". Henry's brothers William and Thomas arrived in Sydney on 18 March 1825. His reports caused an immediate rush of applicants for land grants in these desirable new districts and in May 1825 when he revisited the area, he was commissioned to select land for a number of settlers. His main purpose was to accompany and advise Peter McIntyre, superintendent for Thomas Macqueen, in the selection of grants for Macqueen and the McIntyre brothers. On returning from the Upper Hunter Dangar allocated for himself and his brother William land to which McIntyre believed he had prior claim. Dangar suggested a compromise which McIntyre regarded as a bribe and the affair was referred to the Governor, who set up a board of inquiry. The board found Dangar guilty of using his public position for private gain and he was dismissed from office on 31 March 1827. Governor Sir Ralph Darling recommended that he be dispossessed of the land under dispute and required to take his grant in some other district. Dangar returned to England to appeal against this recommendation, claiming ample precedent for his actions. Oxley supported him, recording that \\"he has performed his duties with zeal and in the most efficient and correct manner, and afforded no occasion, within my knowledge, in the execution of arduous and perplexing duties, for censure and complaint against his public conduct\\". Although the appeal was unsuccessful, this visit to England determined Dangar's future career. During the voyage he wrote his \\"Index and Directory to Map of the Country Bordering Upon the River Hunter\\", which was published in London in 1828. It demonstrated his skill as a cartographer and ability as a surveyor and brought him to the immediate attention of the directors of the Australian Agricultural Company. He was offered, and accepted, an appointment as a surveyor to the company under Sir Edward Parry. Accompanied by his wife Grace, whom he married at St Neot in Cornwall on 13 May 1828, and with their infant son, William John, (b. 1829) he returned in April 1830 to take up his new position at Port Stephens. In addition to topographical and soil reports on the company's grants Dangar surveyed its 400,000 acre (161,876ha) reserve north of the Manning River. So unfavourable were his reports of the whole area that Parry sent him to explore, as an alternative location, the Liverpool Plains districts recommended originally by Oxley. From the headwaters of the Manning, Dangar crossed the Great Dividing Range to the Liverpool Plains, a feat of extreme endurance and skill which he performed for a second time afterwards, and selected for Parry's personal examination an extensive area of attractive land. Parry then visited the district with him and after much negotiation, during which Dangar and the government surveyor, George White, made a joint survey, the company's claim to the land was accepted by the government. This accomplished, Dangar's services were no longer needed and in June 1833 he retired to his property, Neotsfield, near Singleton. At Newcastle he had boiling down works and meat-processing and tinning works, and in New Zealand he established a steam flour mill near the wheat farms around Official Bay. As a magistrate and member of the District Council his experience and judgement were in frequent demand, and he gave time and energy to the agricultural and political advancement of the Hunter Valley. In common with most large landholders who were seriously short of labour, he supported the proposed reintroduction of transportation and advocated the use of coolie labour. He welcomed the government's immigration policy and sponsored many immigrant families from Britain and later from Saxony. With some hesitation he accepted nomination for the electoral district of Hunter, Brisbane and Bligh in the first elective New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, but his brothers Thomas and William Dangar, both resident in the Upper Hunter, supported his successful opponent, William Dumaresq. In 1845 he was returned for Northumberland and remained a strongly-conservative member of the council until 1851 when he retired from public life. The magnitude and complexity of his pastoral and business interests, combined with the incessant demands of public office and private affairs, at length exhausted even Henry Dangar's vitality. Early in 1852 he sailed for England, returning to NSW in 1856 after an extensive tour of the Continent. He lived in retirement at (castle-like) Grantham, Potts Point and died on 2 March 1861 and was buried in the churchyard of All Saints' Church of England, Singleton in a tomb of Italian marble for which his will provided and in which his widow, Grace, was buried on 18 August 1869. Their surviving children were William John of Neotsfield, Henry Cary Dangar MLA, Frederick Holkham, Albert Augustus, Francis Richard, Margaret and Florence. Neotsfield under Dangar On 16 May 1825, Governor Thomas Brisbane granted Henry Dangar 300 acres, situated at Patrick's Plains, near Singleton. He named this grant \\"Neotsfield\\" after his native place of St Neot in Cornwall, South-West England. On the same day, he also acquired another 700 acres adjoining this grant, giving a total of 1000 acres for Neotsfield. Henry's brother, William John (1800-1868) successfully managed Henry's business affairs from 1925 to 1935, including running Neotsfield farm from until 1933, before settling at Turanville, near Scone. William's pastoral interests became so extensive that Turanville was managed by his brother-in- law, Samuel Wellington Cook, whose son established a stud farm there. William inspired many of Henry Dangar's progressive ventures and shared in others until he returned to England in 1857. William John Dangar supervised the initial house's construction during his years managing Neotsfield. Over the next decade or so the buildings were constructed and became known as Neotsfield. Dangar set cattle on the property and cleared the acres of land around the homestead. Early descriptions of the property indicate that the land was improved in \\"every known way\\", with trees being cleared with discretion in order to leave sufficient shade. The property was well-watered by the Hunter River, and tanks and reservoirs filled by windmill pumps meant that there was no shortage of water for the valuable stock. Dangar ran cattle on the property and at one time a small herd of black buck from India. Apparently they bred so profusely that they became a serious nuisance and were eventually presented to the Zoo. In June 1833, Henry Dangar retired to Neotsfield and took over management of the property. By that time, it was a flourishing and highly developed farm, its stock and produce receiving much favourable comment.Henry Dangar quickly extended his interest, purchasing additional grazing properties and leasing extensive runs which by 1850 amounted to more than 300,000 acres (121, 407 ha). Along the Great North Road to the Liverpool Plains he acquired town allotments and established inns and stores. The main house block would have been erected some time between 1833 and 1838. It had wide verandahs, was designed around a three-sided courtyard (i.e. had two wings). The eastern wing contained temporary family quarters and the wine cellar until such time as the house block was built. It was a large and complex group with 29 rooms built over a period of approximately 50 years. Due to financial difficulties in early 1838, Henry was forced to advertise Neotsfield and his other Hunter River properties for sale. These financial difficulties were apparently overcome and consequently the property was retained by Henry Dangar. An advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald said Neotsfield was \\"to be sold and let, by private bargain, and to be given on the 31st May 1838...\\". Later it offered this description: > The house and offices are brick built and complete, and fit for the > residence of a genteel family; they have been erected under the proprietor's > own superintendence and combine elegance with comfort. The house contains > entrance hall, dining and drawing rooms, six bedrooms, pantry, stores and > servants' apartments, and having in front a spacious and elegant verandah. > The offices are detached, and consist of kitchen, laundry, dairy, store, > office, larder, cellars, granary, servants' rooms, coach-house and stabling > for ten horses'. The properties were eventually taken off the market, probably due to some planning on the part of Henry's brother, William. Henry occupied Neotsfield with his wife and family of three sons from 1833‚Äì1857. Between 1843 and 1847 he amassed squattages of over 300,000 acres in New England, on the Liverpool Plains, on the Namoi River and on the Gwydir River. He was elected a Member of the Colonial New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1845‚Äì51. Henry Dangar died at his home \\"Grantham\\" in Potts Point, Sydney on 2 March 1861. His wife Grace, as executrix, continued to manage his properties and estates which he had acquired, until she distributed them in 1868. She died at Neotsfield on 16 August 1869. Dangar's descendants at Neotsfield Neotsfield passed from Grace Dangar to their son William John (W. J.) Dangar, not to be confused with the property's former manager, his uncle of the same name. During W. J. Dangar's time here he was responsible for starting and developing one of the most successful and highly respected throroughbred horse studs in Australia. He was also a member of the then Horticultural Society of Sydney (Horticultural Society of NSW). This consisted of prominent members of the colony and professional gardeners. His interest in horticulture most certainly resulted in the development of the formal layout of the magnificent garden at Neotsfield. The garden was laid out to the front and two sides of the main house block and was about two acres in extent. Italian Carrara marble urns/vases stood on the front verandah in his time here. W. J. Dangar, living at Neotsfield at the time, thought of pulling down the house and building a new one, and had plans drawn up in London. Owing to his wife's death, he decided against this idea and sold the plans to a neighbour, Duncan Mackay. He had the mansion \\"Minimbah\\" built as a result between 1875‚Äì77. Many of the fine Victorian additions to the homestead at this time, together with the construction of the wooden stables. William also acquired more land during his ownership of Neotsfield. William Dangar died at Neotsfield on 3 August 1890. There were no children from his marriage. Neotsfield passed to the late William's brother Henry Cary Dangar along with its established thoroughbred stud. He quickly became well known as a breeder and an owner of great racehorses and also as a member of the committee of the Australian Jockey Club. One of Henry C. Dangar's best horses bred at Neotsfield at this time was a horse named \\"Gibraltar\\". He also imported a horse named \\"Positano\\", who later sired the immortal racehorse \\"Poseidon\\" at Neotsfield stud. In 1895 the property passed to Richard Halifax (R. H.) Dangar, William's nephew. He continued breeding thoroughbred horses and Suffolk Punch horses for farm work. The most famous horse bred there during his time was \\"Poseidon\\". He was sold as a foal at foot at the break up of the Neotsfield stud in 1904 and consequently became the winner of 19,000 pounds in stakes. R. H. Dangar was probably responsible for the Boom-style additions to the house itself, in the form of the upper servants' quarters above the billiard room. He too acquired extra land after becoming the owner and by 1900, the Neotsfield estate had grown to around 8000 acres in area. Neotsfield's Subdivisions (1913; 1914; 1923) The original approach to the homestead was by way of a drive from the former gates and Gate Lodge on the present New England Highway further towards Singleton. A service drive on the northern side of the homestead was linked to the river by a gravel drive. The first and second subdivisions resulted in the main entry road from the Gate House lodge and gates on the New England Highway passing through five of the newly created blocks. This isolated the gates and Gate Lodge on a 50-acre land parcel. As a consequence a lane about 300 yards to the north of the old entry road and running south along the boundary line was incorporated in the subdivision plan. This access lane to Neotsfield later became known as Haggarty's Lane. Before it reached the homestead block it veered slightly to the south until it met the last section of the old entrance road at the boundary of the homestead block before proceeding on. The first subdivision of the Neotsfield Estate was surveyed by Newcastle surveyor William Francis Hall in December 1913. In 1914 subdivision and auction sale of 11 small farm lots (between 37-63 acres) followed. On 3 March 1914 the second subdivision took place. This resulted in another 14 small farms (38-55 acres) being created (surveyed by Sydney surveyor, W. H. Gregson). It was not until 12 June 1920 that these blocks were advertised for sale. Sales continued until January 1923 when it was noted that all of the first and second subdivisions of the Neotsfield Estate had been sold. Part included the homestead block of 400 acres. This block was then further subdivided until it consisted of 226 acres 7 roods 33 perches (a 1944 survey found the actual area was 219 acres 6 roods). It was finally sold to John Frederick Knodler in April 1924 and he took possession on 1 July 1924. The second 1920 subdivision resulted in the main entry road from the lodge gates on the New England Highway passing through five of the newly created blocks. This effectively isolated the lodge gates and residence on a 50-acre parcel of land. As a consequence a lane about 300 yards to the north of the old entry road and running south along the boundary line was incorporated into the subdivision plan. This access lane to Neotsfield later became known as Haggerty's Lane. Before it reached the homestead it veered slightly to the south until it met the last section of the old entrance road at the boundary of the homestead block before proceeding on (*3, 8). Since 1920-24 the approach to the homestead has been via the rear or service yard, rather than to the front of the house. (*2, 8, *4, 8). In 1928 all that remained of the once 8000 acre Neotsfield holding was the homestead block of 226 acres (*3, 8). A 1944 survey found this was in fact 220 acres (*3, 9) Richard Dangar vacated Neotsfield on 16 July 1924. He had purchased a property at Turee, Cassilis and took with him the ornate Carrara marble urns/vases from the house's front verandah. He died at Cassilis on 19 August 1940. Knodler family John F. Knodler took possession of Neotsfield on 1 July 1924. The purchase price was 10,000 pounds after an amount of 500 pounds had been allowed for maintenance and painting of the homestead and adjacent buildings. Three timber houses stood along the upper banks of the river. His son George Frederick Knodler and his wife took up residence in one, while the other two were occupied by workmen. A modern dairy was constructed almost immediately and one of the first irrigation plants in the Hunter river was installed. The latest machinery needed to work the property efficiently was purchased. Two men were employed specifically to tend the gardens and regular maintenance was carried out on the buildings. The house and buildings were well maintained using some of the same tradespeople that Richard Dangar had employed. Early in their ownership, Knodler and his three sons George, Frederick and Earle became involved in breeding and racing horses. Each year yearlings were transported to Sydney to be auctioned by renowned bloodstock expert and family friend Ken Austin of H. Chisholm and Co. bloodstock sales (later William Inglis and Son). The most successful horse was named \\"Lady Neot\\". Bloodstock was also taken on agistment, the most famous of which was the racehorse \\"Statesman\\", who was sent to Neotsfield for several months by his owner and prominent Sydney trainer, Mr. W. Kelso. On his return to racing he was entered in the 1928 Melbourne Cup which he consequently won. Thoroughbred Clydesdale draught horses were also stabled on the property during this period. A Guernsey cattle stud was also established at Neotsfield. The lighting plant was taken out of service in the late 1920s and the homestead converted to normal supply. The other three houses were connected at this time. John F. Nodler died at Neotsfield on 25 July 1938. The farm was then managed by his wife Christiana until 16 February 1944, when plans were made for subdivision. At that time, Neotsfield was surveyed and subdivided into three lots of 73 acres 2 roods by surveyor Cephas Scott (Scott & Crisp). After the transfer of each lot on 7 August 1944 to each of Christiana's sons, Lot 3 became Neotsfield and the property of Frederick C. Y. Knodler. After creating the three properties, an agreement was reached between the three brothers regarding the two timber stable buildings. The first set of stables that stood on the left of the entry road and north of the homestead's west wing was dismantled and reconstructed on Neots Park (and remains standing). The second set of stables further along and opposite the brick stables were also dismantled and relocated on Lar Neot. These no longer exist. The corn shed which was adjacent to the wool shed was also moved to Neots Park (and remains standing). The middle timber house which was the residence of George F. Knodler was relocated on his property Lar Neot. The statue from the south- west corner of the garden, together with the steel hedge fence and several concrete vases were relocated in the house garden at Neots Park. Frederick Cornwell York (C.Y.) Knodler, as the new owner, built a dairy south of the brick stables and on the opposite side of the entry road. He continued general farming and dairying on the property. In 1947 the original dairy which had been built by John Knodler in 1924 and located in Neots Park was totally destroyed by fire. Building materials were in very short supply at this time so it was decided to demolish the east wing of Neotsfield and recycle the bricks and timber. The east wing was causing some concern due to bowing walls and general deterioration. Materials that could be salvaged were used to build the dairy that still stands on Neots Park. On 22 November 1948 Neotsfield was sold and transferred to the government of the day to become Crown Land for closer settlement. The transfer and surrender reads: \\"To his Most Gracious Majesty King George the Sixth for the purposes of The Closer Settlement Acts\\". Crown Land leased (1948-1975) Reginald T. Tom was granted the Crown Land Closer Settlement lease of Neotsfield on 26 November 1948. He continued to farm Neotsfield and operate the dairy. Later in his tenure he became involved in contract hay baling on some adjacent farms. During his occupancy the homestead became neglected and consequently fell into a state of disrepair. A hole developed in the slate roof and this was not repaired. This allowed water entry causing long term damage. Various items from in and around the house were sold to interested parties. The brass bell from the bell post is thought to have been sold to one of the Singleton schools. A large clover leaf shaped cement section garden bed surround was sold to a local resident. The life- sized garden statue from the south-eastern corner of the garden was also sold. The broken pieces of elegant black marble fireplace from the dining room were much later found scattered around the grounds. Pieces of ruby glass windows from the mezzanine level bathrooms also were later found in the garden. The staircase railing also became damaged. Shutters were removed and disposed of. The garden at the front and sides of the homestead gradually became overgrown with grass and weeds until it was used as an area to run cattle. The pebbled gravel on the surface of the courtyard on the northern side of the house was also not raked or maintained resulting in this area also grassing over. It remains in this state to the present. In 1955 flood water entered the house to a depth of 12 to 14 inches. The woolshed was destroyed by fire and the front balcony and verandah became so dangerous that they had to be demolished. During this process the finely carved sandstone columns were broken into pieces and the balcony joists were shortened in length with a saw. Neotsfield was now in a very neglected state. After Tom's death the property passed to his son, Donald Tom, who was granted the lease on 22 May 1968. For the next five years he continued to farm Neotsfield. After this he decided to move to a larger property to grow wheat. The property then passed to J. and J. E. Britts on 10 June 1973. During the Britts' occupancy no restoration work of any consequence occurred and Neotsfield continued to languish. Recovery: Ted & Lesley Crimmings (1975-97) After two years of the Britts' lease, the property was again placed on the market and sold to Ted and Lesley Crimmings on 28 August 1975 for $81,000. It was their intention to restore Neotsfield to its former Georgian glory. Considering the very poor condition of the homstead they faced a huge challenge, including clearing the billiard room where food for goats had been stored. The large hole in the eastern side of the slate roof needed immediate attention to prevent even more water entering the building. This was done using corrugated iron sheeting. The roof now had three covering materials: slate, asbestos shingles over the servants' quarters and corrugated iron. Internally, broken pieces of black marble fireplace found scattered in the garden were glued back together. Pieces of ruby glass from the mezzanine level bathroom windows found in the garden were also refitted. Cedar joinery throughout the house required stripping of paint. After Neotsfield was heritage-listed (in 1983 a permanent conservation order was placed on it under the NSW Heritage Act 1977), a $3000 Heritage Council grant in 1981 provided some funds to pay for an architectural assessment. Other grants were provided as the work continued. General restoration continued over many years before the balcony and verandah could be rebuilt. Only the shortened balcony joists remained as a guide to the replacement of this section of the house. Architects Suters and Busteed were engaged to provide plans for the work. By 1990 both balcony and verandah had been replaced to look like the original structures. However some materials used and certain elements of their design were not the same as the original. Instead of timber, flat sheeting was used to line the underside of the roof of the verandah. Corrugated iron was used to cover the top of the roof instead of slate. Perhaps understandably, the sandstone pillars were replaced with sandstone- coloured concrete columns because of cost. The original timber beams between the pillars were not a full curve as (built) on the reconstructed verandah. Instead the curved timber pieces that came from each pillar were originally relatively short in length. On 15 March 1994 Neotsfield was surveyed by surveyor Robert George to subdivide the property into two lots and provide an access road from the homestead to Racecourse Lane. Lots 31 and 32 were created with the house on Lot 31 and comprising 23.9 acres. Following a severe hailstorm at Singleton in December 1996 the covering on the house's roof was so badly damaged that it required complete replacement. This was done in 1997 using imported slate. Recent owners The property was sold to Neville Hodkinson and possession given during 1997. Internal restoration work continued. In 2004, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that it had \\"in the past been open for inspection\\" but that it had recently changed hands and its status was \\"in limbo\\". In February 2015, it was again sold, this time to an unnamed local family, with \\"plans to ensure its continued preservation\\". House The main buildings, in (Victorian) Regency (Revival) style were originally designed around a three-sided courtyard, with the homestead itself being built after the two wings. These were used as a kitchen, servants' rooms, store, dairy, scullery, wine cellar and temporary family quarters while the residence itself was constructed. The main house block would have been erected some time between 1833 and 1838. It had wide verandahs, was designed around a three-sided courtyard (i.e. had two wings). It was a large and complex group with 29 rooms built over a period of approximately 50 years. The billiard room at the western end of the house with the servants' quarters over was a much-later structure as was the Victorian-styled porch and bathroom to the service yard (western and northern sides of the homestead, respectively). These later works were commissioned by Henry Dangar's son, William John Dangar, who attempted to match the pile created by his brother Albert at Baroona.Deamer, pp165-7, 1971, in *1, 84-85 The eastern wing was demolished. It had contained the temporary family quarters and the cellar until such time as the house block was built. Only the western wing remains and is much altered internally to its original form. It was intended for use as a servant's rooms, storehouse, kitchen, scullery, dairy room etc. The blank western wall of this wing, as well as the eastern wall of the matching wing, was relieved by the use of an arcaded effect achieved by the use of semi- circular headed recesses formed in the brickwork. This rhythmic device provided sufficient visual interest to overcome what would perhaps have been an overpowering planar quality to the wall, unsympathetic to the remainder of the forms. Outbuildings Of the original outbuildings, only the Stables, Meat House and the base of the former Green House remain. ;Stables The Stables are in need of further reconstruction work to the external walls (some has been done), new roofing and roof plumbing and new flooring to the Hay Loft. ;Meat House The Meat House remains in almost original condition externally. Its roof plumbing and timberwork should be treated to prevent further deterioration. ;Green House Only the rendered base of the former green house remains. ;Shed There is also a derelict shed betwewen the Meat House and the western wing. Garden Only a few remnants remain of the original formal garden which surrounded three sides of the house. These include the former turning circle centre surround, and the bases of three Italian vases, together with some large trees. The original formal garden was laid out to the front and two sides of the main house block and about two acres in extent It also included an orchard, a kitchen garden and a vinery of table grapes. The green house, with its glazed roof, was apparently used to raise ferns and palms. Only the base of the green house remains today. The garden at the front and sides of the house gradually became overgrown with grass and weeds until it was used as an area to run cattle. The formal garden layout had disappeared. Italian vases of Carrara marble (8) that once graced the front of the house (*4, 8) were taken by William Dangar when he left Neotsfield in 1924 and installed at his new property in Cassilis. The bases of three concrete garden vases (once a number of these were laid out across the garden) remain (*4, 4). Remnants of the symmetrical layout to the front include the former turning circle centre surround and some planting including some large trees. These formed part of an ornamental section of the garden and were surrounded by lawns, shrubs and flower beds. The garden at the front and sides of the house gradually became overgrown with grass and weeds until it was used as an area to run cattle. The formal garden layout had disappeared. Trees include the Californian desert fan palm (Washingtonia robusta).  Modifications and dates  * 1821 and 1825: grants of 700 and 800 acres respectively. * -33: Carriage House & Stables built (before the house) to the north east of the house's eastern wing, having its main axis at right angles to the other two. * 1833-8: house built: The house's eastern wing was built first - containing the temporary family quarters and the cellar until such time as the house block. The western wing was originally detached, consisting of kitchen, laundry, dairy, store, office, larder, cellars granary, servants' rooms, coach-house, and stabling for ten horses' (this became the western wing, in time joined to the house). The approach was by way of a drive paved with bricks from the former gates and Gate Lodge situated on the New England highway further towards Singleton. It linked to the river by a well-raked gravel drive. A service drive on the northern side of the homestead was linked to the river by a gravel drive. * 1833-88: various additions to make the homestead a large complex around a three-sided courtyard. Probably the lower roof of the ground floor verandah did not exist (in 1838) and was added at a later date along with finely turned stone columns when the verandah was extended along the east and west walls of the house. * 1860s+: horse stud use introduced and intensified. Fencing, yards etc. developed under William J.Dangar. He also developed the formal garden, an area of around 2 acres around the house. He also acquired more land for the farm. The billiard room at the western end of the house with the servants' quarters over it was a much-later structure as was the porch and bathroom to the service yard (western and northern sides of the homestead, respectively). These later works were commissioned by Henry Dangar's son, William John Dangar, who attempted to match the pile created by his brother Albert at Baroona. William John Dangar concentrated on improving the quality of the racehorse stud and imported high class thoroughbreds and Arab horses. This was continued by Henry C. Dangar between 1890 and 1895. * 1895+: Richard H. Dangar additions to the homestead and land to the farm. * 1900: Neotsfield's land holding covered around 8000 acres * 1900?: undated photography shows the timber outbuildings associated with the stables - these have since been demolished. Pierced brickwork to provide ventilation is visible in the hay loft. * From 1900-1924: under Richard H.Dangar's ownership the estate of 8000 acres was subdivided into a series of small farms and sold off. * : first floor servants' quarters built along with an infill panel between balcony and verandah roof. Italian urns line up along the ground floor verandah posts beside the drive. * 1914: subdivision and auction sale of 11 small farm lots (between 37-63 acres). * 1920: second subdivision tinto another 14 small farms (38-55 acres) were advertised for sale. Sales continued until 1923 when all of the first and second subdivision lots had been sold. * 1923: final subdivision of the Estate. Part included the homestead block of 400 acres. This block was then further subdivided until it consisted of 226 acres 7 roods 33 perches (a 1944 survey found the actual area was 219 acres 6 roods). * John F. Knodler added a modern dairy soon after 1924, one of the first irrigation plants on the Hunter River and the latest farm machinery * 1924 Richard Dangar vacated Neotsfield on 16/7/1924, taking the ornate Carrara marble urns from the front verandah. A large disposal sale of household goods and furniture was held on behalf of Richard Dangar in Neotsfield's courtyard in June that year. The Knodler family built a modern dairy, one of the first irrigation plants in the Hunter and purchased the latest machinery needed to work the property efficiently. * Late 1920s - the lighting plant taken out of service and the homestead converted to normal supply. The other three houses were connected at this time (*4: 5, 9). * after 1949?: Eastern wing was demolished. The property has been subdivided into a number of smaller farms over the years, separating the former gate house from the homestead and altering the direction of approachSuters & Busteed, 1981,1 * 1974 Neotsfield was subdivided into two lots and an access road was provided from the homestead to Racecourse Lane. Lots 31 and 32 were created. * 1975-97: The Crimmings purchased Neotsfield to live in it and restore it. Considering the very poor condition of the homestead they faced a huge challenge, including clearing the Billiard Room where food for goats had been stored. The large hole in the slate roof needed immediate attention to prevent even more water from entering the building. This was done using corrugated iron sheeting. The roof now had three covering materials: slate, asbestos shingles over the servants' quarters and corrugated iron. Internally, the broken black marble fireplace pieces rescued from the garden were glued back together. The pieces of Ruby glass from the mezzanine level bathroom windows were also refitted. Cedar joinery throughout the house required stripping of paint. * 1977: only the western wing remains and is much altered internally. It was intended for use as a servant's rooms, storehouse and dairy * In 1981 the group of buildings included the two storied brick homestead and associated western wing, the original carriage house and stables building and other minor outbuildings including a meat store and the remains of a greenhouse. * 1980s: renovations * December 1994: Western Wing: repaired and replaced roofing iron, fascia, eaves, guttering and downpipes after damage by wind storms and fires of 12/93 and 1/94. A gable on the western side of the wing was removed. Guttering, eaves, fascia and downpipes to the main house were also replaced. Restoration work to west wing's interior to commence afterwards.  Heritage listing  Neotsfield was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The history of Neotsfield is the history of Henry Dangar and his family. The property has substantial significance on this basis alone. Henry Dangar has a place in our history for his contribution to the country's early development. His work as a Surveyor for both the Government and later the A. A. Company literally put Newcastle and its surroundings on the map. The Dangar family built up strong commercial interests in the Upper Hunter and the name can be linked with neighbouring properties such as \\"Baroona\\" and \\"Minimbah\\".

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Neotsfield is significant for its combination of architectural styles, rather than being a precise example of one particular style. The main house block was built in (Victorian) Regency (Revival) style with the later Billiards Room and rear porch and bathroom additions being in Victorian style. Still later the first floor Servants' Quarters and Kitchen Stair link were constructed in Boom style. Deamer (1971) considers that these later additions were commissioned by Henry's son William in an endeavour to match \\"the pile created by his brother Albert at \\"Baroona\\" \\". The interesting manner in which the blank outer walls of the two wings were relieved has been mentioned previously. The now-demolished verandah to the front was a good example of architectural detailing of the time, with finely-turned stone columns supporting its roof. The placement and form of the various out buildings is an important element in the complex. The Carriage House and Stable, Meat House and Green House are all visually interesting buildings that add to the significance of the homestead. Unfortunately the former Gate House, which is also a fine piece of architecture, no longer belongs to the same property....Suters & Busteed, 1981, 17 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Neotsfield is undoubtedly a landmark in the Singleton district, together with the other former pastoral homesteads. These properties and their family history are known to many people within the community. They form part of an image of rich farming and grazing properties set along the Hunter River. With the present influx of industrial development in the Hunter Valley, and particularly in the Singleton district, properties of this type can perhaps be a timely reminder of our past to both old and new generations.Suters & Busteed, 1981, 18 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Clement is an atmospheric and marine scientist studying and modeling global climate change. Her research focuses on cloud albedo feedbacks, ocean circulation patterns, and the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). She is currently a professor at University of Miami's Rosenstiel School.  Early life and education  Clement was born in Boston, Massachusetts but moved to Long Island, New York shortly after, where she spent most of her adolescent life. Clement attended Columbia College where she received a B.A. in Physics. She received her Ph.D from the Earth and Environmental Science program at Columbia University. Her studies continued at the University of Pierre and Marie Currie in Paris, France where she conducted her postdoctoral work. Growing up, Clement's parents, who worked as an engineer and a writer respectively, held high expectations for their children to do something important. She was therefore drawn to science as a young child, volunteering in labs to extend her curiosity of science.  Career and research  Clement is a climate scientist studying atmospheric and oceanic interactions related to climate change. She studies the physics of climate modeling, and seeks to understand the mechanisms of climate change to refine a global climate model. Clement is currently a professor at University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences. She is involved in a long term project focused on understanding the importance of tropical regions in paleoclimate for her global climate model. One of Clements primary research topics focuses on the role of the cloud albedo feedback in a warming climate. Her studies examine low-altitude clouds, which are capable of reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space. She studies the relationship between the cover of these clouds and the rate of warming to examine the role of clouds. Clements findings support this theory in that as climate and oceans warm, low laying clouds form less frequently, which lowers the albedo of the earth (more infrared radiation is absorbed rather than reflected), leading to a warmer climate with less clouds. As most in of her research, these findings support a positive feedback warming cycle in climate. Additionally, Clement has conducted significant research on the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is known to play a large role in the climate system. Clement and her researchers somewhat controversially suggest that atmospheric and ocean dynamics need not be connected in order to understand tropical climate and their associated global patterns. She was awarded the James B Macelwane Medal in 2007. The Macelwane Medal is presented to young scientists who has made significant contributions in the realm of geophysical sciences. Clement was nominated for this award because of her research in tropical atmospheric and ocean dynamics. In conducting this research, she focused on how the atmosphere and ocean interact with both orbital changes and the thermohaline circulation system.  Significant publications  * Orbital controls on the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the tropical climate, Paleoceanography, 1999 *The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation without a role for ocean circulation, Science, 2015 *An Ocean Dynamical Thermostat, Journal of Climate, 1996 *Observational and Model Evidence for Positive Low-Level Cloud Feedback, Science 2009  Awards and honors  Clement has earned several awards throughout her career for her intellectual leadership and mentoring success. * Fellow of the American Meteorological Society * Fellow to the American Geophysical Union * AMS Lawrence Leroy Meisinger Award * AGU James B. Macelwane Medal in 2007 * Rosenstiel School Outstanding Faculty Mentor Award (2015), because of her dedication to encouraging students to think more critically and creatively about fundamental climate processes.

She is a professor and Director of the State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Director of the Shanghai Institute of Hematology, and Vice-Chairwoman of the Chinese Medical Association. She is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and The World Academy of Sciences, and a foreign associate of the French Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine and the Royal College of Physicians of the UK. She has made important discoveries in the pathogenesis of leukemia and developed therapies to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other types of leukemia.  Biography  Chen was born in May 1951 in Yinzhou District, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China. During the early Cultural Revolution, she was forced to quit school and work in a textile factory at age 17. She was able to enter Shanghai Second Medical College a few years later, in 1972, and worked at Ruijin Hospital after graduating in 1975. When graduate research was resumed after the Cultural Revolution, Chen was accepted in 1978 by the renowned hematologist Wang Zhenyi as his graduate student. Another student Wang accepted at the same time was Chen Zhu, her future husband. Chen Saijuan earned her master's degree from Shanghai Second Medical College in 1981. She married Chen Zhu in March 1983, and the couple both went abroad to study in France, he in 1984, and she in 1986. She earned her D.Sc. from Paris VII University in 1989. After returning to China, she became a professor at Shanghai Second Medical College, which was later merged into Shanghai Jiao Tong University to become its medical school. She is now Director of the State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Director of the Shanghai Institute of Hematology, and Vice- Chairwoman of the Chinese Medical Association.  Scientific contributions  Chen's research is focused on molecular genetics and especially the cytogenetics of leukemia, and she has made important discoveries on the pathogenesis and therapy of leukemia on the cellular and molecular level. She cloned the m-BCR (minor breakpoint cluster region) of the BCR gene and discovered a new type of APL (acute promyelocytic leukemia) and new \\"nonrandom chromosomal translocations\\" of leukemia. Based on her discoveries, she developed a new therapy that turned previously fatal APL into a highly curable disease, and made progress toward curing other types of leukemia. She has published more than 300 research papers in peer-reviewed journals.  Honours and recognition  For her contributions to medical research, Chen was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 2003 and The World Academy of Sciences in 2007.

Laura Russo was one of the people responsible for the regulation of the librarian profession. She was the founder and first president of the Federa√ß√£o Brasileira de Associa√ß√µes de Bibliotec√°rios (FEBAB) and of the Conselho Federal de Biblioteconomia (CFB). As a librarian, she worked at the Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia de S√£o Paulo, at the Academia Paulista de Letras, at the Biblioteca M√°rio de Andrade, amongst other institutions.  Education  Laura Russo obtained a bachelor's degree in Library Science in 1942 from the Escola Livre de Sociologia e Pol√≠tica. In 1959, she got a degree in Documentation from the same institution. In 1958 she got a master's degree in Library and Archival Science from the National Library of Spain. During the 1960s, she took courses in Library Science in the United States. In 1975, she obtained a bachelor's degree in Law from the Universidade de S√£o Paulo.  Career  Russo worked as a librarian at Santa Casa from 1942 to 1950, working specifically at the First Surgical Clinic for Women from 1950 to 1952. In 1947 she received an award from the Associa√ß√£o Paulista de Bibliotec√°rios for her work with hospital libraries. In 1951, she founded the circulating library Prof. Celestino Bourroul for the hospital patients. Russo worked as a librarian for the Municipal Library System of S√£o Paulo. From 1942 to 1959, she worked in the Acquisitions department of the M√°rio de Andrade Library. From 1959 to 1961, she was the head of the Child Psychology Section of the Monteiro Lobato Library, returning to M√°rio de Andrade's Acquisition department as chief librarian from 1961 to 1968. In 1968, she became Library Director of M√°rio de Andrade Library. From 1955 to 1957, Russo was the librarian at Casa Cervantes, receiving an award from the institution in 1957 for her work.  Professional associations  In 1959, Russo gave a presentation with Rodolfo Rocha J√∫nior at the II Congresso de Biblioteconomia e Documenta√ß√£o in Salvador, Bahia, that would lead to the creation of the Federa√ß√£o Brasileira de Associa√ß√µes de Bibliotec√°rios (FEBAB). She was nominated as FEBAB's first director in 1961. Russo worked as editor of FEBAB's bulletin from 1961 to 1970, and as editor for the Revista Brasileira de Biblioteconomia e Documenta√ß√£o from 1973 to 1977. In 1966, Russo participated in the creation of the Conselho Federal de Biblioteconomia (CFB) and the Regional Councils (Conselhos Regionais). She was elected as CFB's first president.  Legislation and regulation of the profession  With the assistance of Maria Helena Brand√£o, Russo wrote the document that would become the Law 4.084 of 1962, defining the profession of the librarian and regulating its exercise. Ultimately, the goal of the legislation was to create a market reserve for librarians, guaranteeing that only those with a bachelor's in Library Science could practice the profession. It was believed that this would bring greater visibility and respect for the profession. In 1962, she received an award from the Associa√ß√£o Paulista de Bibliotec√°rios for her work with Law 4.084/62.  Code of ethics  Laura Russo wrote the first version of the Librarian Professional Code of Ethics in 1961. The code would be approved in 1963, achieving legal status in 1966 and falling under the responsibility of CFB.  Laura Russo Award  As a tribute to her professional work, the Regional Council of Librarianship of the State of S√£o Paulo (CRB-8) created the Laura Russo Prize in 1998, that aims to recognize cultural initiatives and encourage the use of the library and library services.

With Stanley Daniels and John Busby, he founded Jova/Daniels/Busby, a multidisciplinary design firm based in Atlanta, Georgia, which designed several notable projects in Atlanta and throughout the Southeast from 1966 to 2013. Jova is noted for his pioneering support of mixed-use development and interest in the development of Midtown Atlanta.  Background and early career  Jova was born into a prominent European/Caribbean family. His grandfather, Juan Jacinto Jova y Gonzalez-Abreu, had immigrated from Cuba to New York City in 1874 as a sugar broker, then gone into brickmaking around 1884; his father, Juan Louis Jova, was a ceramic engineer and director of the plant. His grandmother, Marie Gabrielle Vatable, originally of Basse-Terre, was a sister of Baron Louis Fran√ßois Vatable, the French governor-general of Guadeloupe. The Marques Sabas Marin, another great-uncle, was governor-general of Cuba and Puerto Rico. His mother, Maria Gonzalez Fernandez Cavada, was the daughter of a Spanish diplomat, and a great-great-niece to Federico Fern√°ndez Cavada, commander of the Cuban insurrectionists against Spain in the Ten Years' War. Jova attended Cornell University, where he joined Lambda Chi Alpha. World War II interrupted his education, and he served in the U.S. Army Combat Engineers in the South Pacific theater. He became a fellow of the American Academy in Rome in 1949, winning its prestigious Rome Prize for architecture in 1951. He worked as a designer for Harrison & Abramovitz in New York City from 1952 to 1954, then relocated to Atlanta seeking a less frantic lifestyle. He joined his first cousin's firm, Abreu & Robeson, and served as their chief of design from 1954 to 1966. Relocation to Midtown In 1960, Jova moved to Midtown Atlanta, at the time in decline. Seeing potential in the neighborhood, he became a major promoter, encouraging friends and colleagues to relocate there. He organized the Midtown Neighborhood Association in 1963, and sponsored a home improvement contest, judged by mayor Ivan Allen, Jr., to encourage owners to invest in their properties. Jova himself bought and renovated several properties on Seventh Street and Mentelle Drive. Jova/Daniels/Busby In 1966, he joined fellow Midtown residents Stanley Daniels and John Busby to form Jova/Daniels/Busby, which became known for fusing classical element with modern designs. Jova is well-known for the development of Colony Square at Peachtree Street and 14th, the first mixed-use development in the Southeastern United States, which opened in phases from 1969 to 1973. His design for the Carnegie Education Pavilion in Hardy Ivy Park (1996) and for the Carter Center (1986 and 1993) also received widespread attention. Jova was also lead designer for Atlanta City Hall (1991), Peachtree Road United Methodist Church Sanctuary (2002), the Atlanta Newspapers Building (1971), the Buckhead branch of what is now SunTrust Banks (1987), MARTA North Avenue station (1981), and the Robert Shaw Room for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra (1983) as well as a number of single family homes and other projects. His work outside Atlanta includes four buildings for Southern Progress Corporation in Birmingham, Alabama (beginning in 1974), Day Butterfly Center at Callaway Gardens (1989); and the First Presbyterian Church in Dalton (1989). His interior design work includes work for the Academy of Medicine, the corporate headquarters for BellSouth Enterprises, and for Robinson Humphrey Co. at the Atlanta Financial Center. Jova stepped down as chair of Jova/Daniels/Busby in 2002. After retirement, he relocated to West Palm Beach, Florida with David Rinehart, his longtime partner, to whom he was wed only a few months before his death.

Along with aluminium(II), it is an extremely unstable form of aluminium. While late Group 3 elements such as thallium and indium prefer the +1 oxidation state, aluminium(I) is rare. Unlike late Group XIII elements, aluminium does not experience the inert pair effect, a phenomenon where valence s electrons are poorly shielded from nuclear charge due to the presence of filled d and f orbitals. As such, aluminium (III) (Al^3+) is the much more common oxidation state for aluminium. Aluminium(I) compounds are both prone to disproportionation and difficult to prepare. At standard conditions, they readily oxidize to the aluminium(III) form.  Characteristics  HOMO and LUMO Orbitals for AlCl. Al(I) appears to be red, as solutions of AlBr and AlCl in organic solvents are both red. The presence of this color implies a relatively small HOMO/LUMO gap that is accessible by green light. The geometry of compounds can be determined by analysis of the fine structure of the electronic spectra. Matrix isolation spectroscopy prevents disproportionation of aluminium monohalides and thus allows for the measuring of transitional vibrations as well as reactivity with molecules such as O2. Analysis by 27Al NMR spectroscopy of AlCl, AlBr, and AlI in toluene/diethyl ether at room temperature reveal two signals: one very broad signal at Œ¥ = 100-130 ppm (regardless of the halogen), and one at higher field strength (AlCl: Œ¥ = + 30, AlBr: Œ¥ = + 50, AlI: Œ¥ = + 80). The first signal corresponds to a donor-stabilized four-coordinate aluminium species, while the identity of the latter is inconclusive.  Monohalides  The aluminium(I) cation reacts with hydrogen halides to form the following aluminium monohalides: * aluminium monofluoride (AlF) * aluminium monochloride (AlCl) * aluminium monobromide (AlBr) * aluminium monoiodide (AlI) These compounds are only thermodynamically stable at high temperatures and low pressures in the singlet ground state. However, decomposition can be prevented by making disproportionation kinetically unfavorable. Under cold temperatures (below 77 K), disproportionation is slow enough that the AlCl solid can be kept for long periods of time.  Synthesis  AlCl is synthesized by reaction of liquid aluminium with gaseous HCl at 1200 K and 0.2 mbar to yield gaseous AlCl and hydrogen gas. At 77 K, AlCl is a dark red solid which turns black upon disproportionation at temperatures higher than 180 K. At temperatures under 77 K and dissolved in a matrix of polar and non-polar solvents, it exists as a metastable solution whose reactivity can be studied. AlBr, a red oil, is prepared similarly from liquid aluminium metal and gaseous HBr. Al (l) + HCl (g) -> AlCl (g) + 1/2 H2 (g) Due to the nature of HF, which possesses a bond much stronger than that of its congeners, AlF is synthesized instead by the comproportionation of Al and AlF3 which are pressed and mixed into pellets. The pellets are then loaded into a graphite furnace and heated to 1050 K. 2 Al (s) + AlF3 (s) -> 3 AlF (g) Stability increases with mass: while AlCl decomposes at 77 K or above, AlBr remains stable up to 253 K. Remarkably, it has been discovered that at any given temperature, the vapor pressure of AlF is orders of magnitude lower than that of other aluminium monohalides.  Disproportionation  At room temperature, AlX compounds tend to disproportionate to Al and AlX3. When dark red, solid AlCl is allowed to warm up, it turns black to yield aluminium metal and the more stable aluminium (III) chloride salt. 2 AlCl (s)-> Al (s) +AlCl3 (s) Dohmier et. all documented that the exception is AlBr. AlBr is stable enough at temperatures under -30 C that it comproportionates to AlBr2 in the presence of AlBr3. AlBr (s) + AlBr3 (s) -> 2 AlBr2 (s)  Oligomerization  In Lewis basic solutions, AlX compounds have a tendency to oligomerize. 449x449px  Complex Chemistry  Aluminium is not only the most abundant metal in the earth's crust, but also an element of low toxicity. As such, aluminium (I) complexes attract considerable interest. These complexes can be supported by various ligands and used to activate small molecules.  Œ≤-Diketiminato Systems  Œ≤-Diketiminato ligands, an example of a NacNac ligand. It is anionic and bidentate. Shown are tautomers of a substituted HNacNac ligand precursor, and an idealized complex (right) of the conjugate base (M = metal, L = other ligand)In 2018, Liu et. al reviewed the chemistry of aluminium (I) with Œ≤-diketiminato ligands, widely used ligands with immense versatility in electronic and steric properties. These aluminium (I) complexes have immense potential for small molecule activation. Synthesis Œ≤-diketiminato aluminium alkyls and aluminium halides are synthesized by adding a trialkyl aluminium compound to the initial Œ≤-diketiminate ligands, adding iodine, and the reducing with potassium. issn=1521-3773}}  [1+2] Cycloadditions  Al(I) compounds exhibit behavior analogous to that of singlet carbenes. Like carbenes, they undergo [1+2] cycloadditions with alkynes and azides to afford three membered ring derivatives such as dialuminacyclohexadiene. Similarly to the nucleophilic carbon center in the carbene, the lone pair on the aluminium center binds to the first azide equivalent. Nitrogen gas is liberated. With the second equivalent of azide, a five-member ring is formed. Aluminium (I) systems undergo reactions with azides in the same fashion as carbenes.  Reactions with Other Small Molecules  Such aluminium (I) complexes can activate water as well as elemental phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur to yield bridged dimers. This occurs via partial reduction of the elemental small molecule. Activation of elemental phosphorus (P4) by an aluminium (I) complex AlCp* ligand.  AlCp*  AlCp*, consisting of aluminium (I) bonded with the pentamethylcyclopentadiene anion ((CCH3)5‚àí), was first synthesized in 1991 by Dohmier et al. (AlCp*)4, a yellow crystalline solid, is first produced from the combination of AlCl and MgCp*2. When vaporized, the long Al-Al bonds (276.9 pm) split, and monomeric molecules of [AlCp*] are created. As revealed through Schnockel's work, [AlCp*] reacts by inserting itself into other bonds. Reaction with Al2I6 yields subvalent halide species; reaction with As4tBu4 yields As-Al bonds. When reacted with transition metal-cyclopentadienyl complexes such as NiCp2, it offers a straightforward pathway to compounds containing aluminium-transition metal bonds, which has great potential for important catalytic reactions. NiCp2 and AlCp* react to form a butterfly structure. The LUMO orbitals of CO are shown here. These orbitals are antibonding œÄ orbitals. As with other AlR ligands, [AlCp*] can be regarded as a CO analogue, as it possesses 2 empty œÄ orbitals and engages in similar coordination modes (terminal and bridging). This similarity implies the possibility of pi backbonding interactions between AlCp*and metals it complexes to.  Metalloidal Clusters  Work in aluminium clusters has been done by Linti and Schnockel. These metalloidal clusters can be formed from Al(I) compounds, namely aluminium monohalides. These clusters are termed \\"metalloidal clusters\\" because the number of unbridged metal-metal bonds is greater than the number of localized metal-ligand bonds. On the way to metal formation, intermediates are trapped in the presence of the bulky ligands which substitute the halide atoms. As a result, metal-rich clusters such as Al77R20 are possible and offer insight into solid bulk metal formation. Tetrahedral aluminium is available from the reaction between aluminium(I) species and organometallic species. These clusters can be made through combinations such as AlCp* and LiR, AlBr and Li(THF)3(SiMe3)3, and AlI and NaSiBu3. 479x479px [Al6(tBu)6]‚Ä¢- cluster, as synthesized by Linti et al. This is the first octahedral aluminium cluster synthesized. This method of cluster formation created the only known incidence of an octahedral aluminium cluster, [Al6(tBu)6]‚àí, which was formed by reaction between AlCl and tBuLi. Similarly, AlCl and LiN(SiMe3)2 react to form the first known example of a cluster where two M4 tetrahedra are connected by a common center.  Natural Occurrence  Aluminium is rarely found in its +1 oxidation state in nature due to the immense stability of the +3 oxidation state. Rotational transitions of AlF and AlCl have been detected in circumstellar shells near IRC +10216. The presence of AlF suggests that fluorine is produced in helium shell flashes instead of explosive nucleosynthesis.

The main event is a chariot procession through the streets. The procession may then be followed by performing arts presentations on the stage and visiting various booths encamped at a park site. The festivals involve chants, the arts, music, and free vegetarian feasts that can be seen over the world but specifically in the United States (birthplace of ISKCON). ISKCON, commonly referred to as Hare Krishna is a branch of Hindu religiosity. ISKCON have used the practice of Hindu festivals as an important element of Hare Krishna expression, and is a recognisable feature of their appearance in the public realm. Kirtan is an element that is common to all ISKCON festivals. Kirtan is a process of musical worship, that is accessible for group participation and as described by Edwin Bryant as ‚ÄúKrishna in vibratory form‚Äù. The practice of kirtan are melodies, mantras, spiritual texts that proclaim God's name in his many forms. The ‚ÄòFestival of India‚Äô is the International society for Krishna consciousness conveying Indian expression in the global sphere.  History  The International society for Krishna Consciousness was founded in New York in 1966 by A.C. Bhakitivendanta Swami Prabhupada. Prabhupada (birth name; Abhay Charan), was born in Calcutta, 1896, and received a European focused education, graduating university with majors in economics, English and philosophy. He committed to a religious journey in 1944 whereby he stated that he has ‚Äò‚Ä¶taken the courage to take up the work.‚Äô In 1965 he migrated to the United States and commenced teachings of the Gita. During his life he completed over 70 volumes on Krishna tradition. ISKCON roots are of Hinduism and focuses on the Gita and Purana which feature Krishna. ISKCON emerged due to the myth of Krishna, Lord Krishna is the eighth avatar of Vishnu, the ‚Äòpreserver‚Äô. Krishna is the protagonist of Hindi texts, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana and the Bhagavad Gita. He acts as a counsel during civil wars and is a symbol of peace and a guide on how to achieve inner liberation and freedom. Additionally, he is known to of explored the importance of yoga to spiritual well-being. Krishna is a highly recognised God in the western world partly due to the Hare Krishna influence in the west. ISKCON follow Vaishnavism meaning the worship of Vishnu and believe Krishna to be the central of all of Vishnu's avatars. Vaishnavas believe that the ultimate reality is personal and there their souls are eternal beings whom have forgotten their connection to God. Strong emphasis is placed on chanting as it is believed that this can awaken to the soul to the spiritual realm.  Ratha Yatra Chariot being pulled by Devotees The festival of Chariots originated in India in a city called Jagannatha Puri. The festival has been used in Vishnu-related traditions in Hinduism along with other traditions such as Daoism. The festival celebrates Lord Krishna return to Vrindavan. Vrindavan is a town in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India however it is also a symbolic as an eternal spiritual place which encumbers everything and is transcendental. To go to Vrindavan is the act of seeing God himself, as you are enveloped by them. Vrindavan is where Krishna returned, but Vrindavan is also Krishna himself. This tradition of using a chariot in public procession is an ancient tradition, common in many Asian traditions. The pulling of the chariot symbolises the pulling of the lord into one's heart.  World-wide example  The festival of the chariots is now celebrated world-wide, in nearly every major city. For example, in San Francisco the festival is celebrated annually. The event causes a city-wide interruption as the festival draws in thousands of people to participate. In 2017 procession wooden carts were rolled through the streets accompanied by the ISKCON chant; ‚ÄúHare krishna, hare krishna, krishna krishna, hare hare‚Ä¶‚Äù. Food and music are essential parts of the festival, as in many ISKCON festivals. Vegetarian food is usually supplied during the festival and well as information on how to become part of the community. The festivals display a connectivity of Indian culture and ethically non-Indian population. Vani Devi Das born in Sacramento, US was brought up within the movement and attends the annual festival. Das makes it a family affair bringing her children. She is an example of the festival of Indian functioning in a western sphere.  Controversy  Notable points of controversy include: People throwing paint # Cultural tension these festivals have caused outside India. In Singapore the state has been historically hostile towards members of ISKCON. The practice of festival, central to their beliefs, have had to been practiced in different ways such as in personal houses, farms or stadiums. ISKCON expression has taken a different mode when interacting with its culturally situated surroundings. # Some believe that the festival has been stripped of its religious value spectators who participate for non-religious recreational purposes. This specifically relates to Holi ‚Äòthe festival of colours‚Äô.

It was absorbed by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) in 1902. Its lines now form the Z√ºrich‚ÄìZug railway (via Affoltern) and the Zug‚ÄìLucerne railway.  History  East-west railway project In 1857, Federal Councilor Jakob St√§mpfli established the Swiss East‚ÄìWest Railway (Schweizerische Ostwestbahn, OWB), which was intended to implement a second railway line through the Central Plateau in direct competition with the Swiss Central Railway (Schweizerische Centralbahn, SCB). The Basle-based SCB had acquired licenses to build and operate railways in Aarau, Lucerne, Bern and Biel and controlled the rail traffic in the Central Plateau. The OWB was to compete as a Bern-based railway company in direct competition with the SCB. The OWB projected a railway line from La Neuveville via Biel, Bern, Langnau im Emmental, Lucerne and Zug to Z√ºrich and began construction without securing the funding for the line. The OWB was only able to open a line between Frienisberg (in Le Landeron) and Biel on 3 December 1860 before going bankrupt. In April 1861, the canton of Bern founded the Bern State Railways (Bernische Staatsbahn, BSB), which took over the bankrupt OWB on 1 June 1861. The BSB completed the projects in the canton of Bern that construction had commenced on in 1864.  Construction by the Northeastern Railway the Swiss Northeastern Railway (Schweizerische Nordostbahn, NOB) took over the planning and concession for the Z√ºrich‚ÄìZug‚ÄìLucerne line from the OWB's bankrupt estate. The Z√ºrich-based NOB created a subsidiary called the Z√ºrich- Zug-Lucerne railway (ZZL) and, after minor revisions of the project, began building the line. Basically planned as a single route, the topography allowed the low-cost connection to Zug only by means of a branch line, which was connected at Kollerm√ºhle by means of a large triangular junction (\\"wye\\"). The Altstetten‚ÄìZug and Kollerm√ºhle‚ÄìG√ºtsch sections and the Knonau-Cham connecting curve were put into operation together by the ZZL on 1 June 1864. The triangular junction allowed the direct connection of the Z√ºrich‚ÄìZug, Zug‚ÄìLucerne and Lucerne‚ÄìZ√ºrich lines. Altstetten station was redesigned as a Keilbahnhof (a station located between branching tracks) for the connection of the ZZL to the NOB‚Äôs Z√ºrich‚ÄìBrugg line and a new station building was built to plans by Jakob Friedrich Wanner. The same architect was responsible for the design of Zug station which was located on today's Bundesplatz and had a track triangle for turning trains. The ZZL route ended at the Untergrund yard where it connected with the Lucerne‚ÄìEmmenbr√ºcke(‚ÄìOlten) line opened by the SCB in 1859, which had to be used to reach Lucerne station, which also belonged to the SCB. The approach to Lucerne changed again to join at the new Fluhm√ºhle yard in August 1875, when the line of the Bern-Luzern Railway (Bern-Luzern- Bahn, BLB) from Langnau im Emmental was opened along with a new entrance to the station by the 317 metre-long Gibraltar tunnel.  Gotthard Railway connection As the Swiss private railways were already in a weak financial situation, an economic crisis in the 1870s brought railway construction to a standstill. However, construction of the Gotthard Railway (Gotthardbahn, GB) commenced after 1869. The SCB and NOB established the Aargau Southern Railway (Aargauische S√ºdbahn, ASB) to build an access route; this reached Rotkreuz station on the ZZL from Muri on 1 December 1881. On 1 June 1882, the ASB also opened the Brugg‚ÄìHendschiken(‚ÄìMuri) and Rotkreuz‚ÄìImmensee lines and the GB opened the Immensee‚ÄìArth-Goldau‚ÄìG√∂schenen line, allowing continuous operations over the Gotthard. The ASB allowed the SCB to operate direct movements via Olten and Aarau to Immensee to the provisional starting point of the Gotthard Railway and the NOB could also operate direct movements via Brugg. Trains running via the ZZL from Zurich and Zug had to reverse in Rotkreuz, but trains running from Lucerne could run directly on to the Gotthard Railway. The building of direct approaches from Z√ºrich and Lucerne to the Gotthard Railway, namely the (Z√ºrich‚Äì)Thalwil‚ÄìZug (NOB), the Zug‚ÄìArth-Goldau (GB) and the Lucerne‚ÄìImmensee (GB) lines, was delayed. At their opening, the ZZL would lose its legal independence.  Gotthard Railway approach On 1 January 1892, the ZZL was completely taken over by its parent company NOB. At the federal level, meanwhile, negotiations continued on the nationalisation of the private railways, the proposal to buy up the SCB had still not been formally discussed in 1891, but the number of advocates of a state railway company in the councils steadily increased. On 1 November 1896, the SCB again changed the approach to Lucerne as part of the construction of the second Lucerne station; the platform area of the station was turned around 90 degrees to face south and the approach was rebuilt to run through two new tunnels, called Sch√∂nheim and G√ºtsch, allowing the removal of all level crossings in the city. After only 21 years of use, the Gibraltar Tunnel was made superfluous and was the third Swiss railway tunnel to be abandoned; until 1981 it was the longest abandoned railway tunnel in Switzerland. The Gotthard Railway‚Äôs access lines were finally completed on 1 June 1897, exactly 15 years after the opening of the Gotthard Railway. The Lucerne‚ÄìImmensee line of the GB was introduced as a parallel line to the SCB with its own platform in Lucerne station. In preparation for the opening of the Thalwil‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway by the NOB and GB, Zug station was relocated and a new station building was built‚Äîthe old station building was moved to Wollishofen. The second station was built between the diverging lines and the wye junction was replaced by the so-called Zug loop. The Zug loop itself was closed in 1990 with the introduction of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn. Trains running via the ZZL line from Z√ºrich entered the station via the loop from the north; it was possible to run towards Arth-Goldau or continue on the ZZL line to Lucerne. For the latter possibility, a parallel track between Chollerm√ºli (Kollerm√ºhle) and Zug was opened on 18 December 1897 so that trains on the ZZL route could run from Cham via the southern track to the station, the loop and back by the northern track to Knonau (and vice versa), allowing Zug Station to be served. In the course of 1897 the Federal Council also passed the so-called Repurchase Act (R√ºckkaufsgesetz) to be put to a referendum; this law, which was to form the basis of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), was put a referendum in 1898 and was adopted by a two-thirds majority. The nationalisation of the NOB took place formally on 1 January 1902; this included the transfer of the line of the former ZZL to the ownership of the SBB.  Z√ºrich‚ÄìAffoltern am Albis‚ÄìZug railway The Z√ºrich‚ÄìAffoltern am Albis‚ÄìZug railway runs through the former Knonaueramt (now the district of Affoltern), giving it the colloquial name of the Knonauer- Strecke (Knonau line). Its importance as an approach line to the Gotthard was lost with the opening of the Thalwil‚ÄìArth-Goldau railway in 1897. The direct Z√ºrich‚ÄìLucerne trains now use the route via Thalwil, so that this branch of the line became a secondary line without through traffic. With the introduction of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn, the line has been somewhat revived and some improvements have been made as a result of increasing passenger traffic.  Zug‚ÄìLucerne railway The line between Zug and Lucerne has not been fully developed to two tracks. Above all, the single-track section along the Rotsee and the single-track Friedtal Tunnel and the subsequent single-track Reus Bridge, are now considered bottlenecks.

It is also known as Baiame‚Äôs Cave, Creator Cave, Dhurramulan, Goign, Wabooee, Baiamai, Biami, Baimae, Biamie, Biaime, Byarmie and Byarme. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 July 2015. Description Baiame Cave rock art Baiame Cave is an exposed escarpment of Hawkesbury sandstone, approximately 24 metres above the adjacent valley, on the western side of Bulga Creek, facing in a north-easterly direction, overlooking the Hunter Valley towards Singleton. The location of the site and the open nature of the cave indicate that the site was specifically chosen for the purpose of showcasing the art interpretation of Baiame the 'Creator', and providing a panoramic view of the Hunter Valley. The site is significantly positioned above the valley floor in close proximity to a permanent water source, and acts as a gallery, enabling the Wonnarua people and visitors from neighbouring Aboriginal nations to view their 'Creator'. The artwork is visible on the rear wall of the cave and depicts a larger-than-life male figure, outlined with white pigment and filled with a red pigment, with two large white circles for eyes and both arms outstretched. There is little to no detail visible, although the figure is the main focal point of the artwork and is positioned just off the centre of the cave. There are several key art stencils scattered around the figure's body below the arms, with only two art stencils located above the arms in the top corner of the cave. The stencils include boomerangs, left and right hands and forearms, a hafted axe and possibly a spear. The lower artwork has visible signs of deterioration due to the pigments fading, although the higher artwork is slightly more protected and appears less deteriorated. The cave and rock art are exposed to the elements throughout the year, but a sloped floor provides good drainage, keeping it dry and free from moisture. The cave shows evidence of infestation by swallows, which have built nests in the roof. Cracks in the sandstone walls and ceiling have appeared on either side of the artwork, with one crack evident through Baiame's right arm. In 1993, the National Parks and Wildlife Service constructed a wooden and compacted earth stairway leading from the unsealed road within the privately owned property to a viewing platform close to the entrance of Baiame Cave, to provide a safe access route and deter inappropriate access to the site. The stairway and mesh viewing platform are in good condition, although future maintenance of the stairway will be needed to maintain safety. For the past 40 years, the private landowners have managed the site through regular inspections, and deterring livestock and inappropriate access. To date there have been no formal comparative studies conducted to compare the artwork of Baiame Cave and its condition over any period of time, however, in 2015 the landowners stated that over the 40 years they have owned the property, the site's condition is increasingly deteriorating with the pigments fading. In 2015, the site remains relatively untouched by vandalism, the artwork is considered to be in its original form, but with fading and deterioration of the pigments caused by natural weathering. Significance Baiame Cave rock art Baiame Cave is a spiritual site depicting the image of the \\"Creator\\", and is an exceptionally rare and unique pigment art representation of Baiame with his arms outstretched over the lands of the Wonnarua people. Baiame Cave is a unique and excellent example of Aboriginal rock art and is highly respected by the local Wonnarua people, numerous Aboriginal nations throughout south-east Australia and the wider community of the Hunter Valley. The artwork depicting Baiame signifies the site's significance as being an integral part of the history and social and cultural dynamics of Aboriginal culture and heritage within the Wonnarua area and surrounding Aboriginal communities. Baiame Cave is linked to the Creation story, country and totem (the Eagle) of the Wonnarua people, and is interconnected with numerous other Aboriginal cultural and heritage sites and landscapes throughout the Hunter Valley and NSW. Baiame is directly associated with several significant Dreaming sites and stories throughout south-east Australia, which have previously been declared Aboriginal Places or listed on the SHR. Baiame Cave is the only known and recorded rock shelter with larger-than-life, pigment art depicting the ancestral creator Baiame. Baiame Cave continues to demonstrate the importance of ancestral beings, creation stories and Dreaming sites throughout Aboriginal communities, providing the Wonnarua people with a place that enables them to maintain traditional practices and customs, share oral histories, creation stories and traditional lore (law). It is a place considered to be of special cultural, social and spiritual significance. Wonnarua traditional owner Victor Perry has described their understanding of the artwork as such: > On the back of this cave out here at Milbrodale is a figure of, a deity > figure that was known up and down the coast in Aboriginal tribal society. He > had different names. In our language we called him Goign. But in some other > languages he was called Baiame or Biamee. In other areas they used to call > him Bundjel, Nerunderee and a lot of other different names. But essentially > the figure in the cave here is . . . revered as the creator figure. If you'd > like to interpret that, that would be the same as same as God as the creator > to the English people. That is the Aboriginal interpretation of the creator. > Just to explain about the drawings around the figure, there's boomerangs > there which are called boringan in the Wonnarua language, stone axes which > are interpreted as mogos. The hands on the wall are symbols of the people > who perhaps looked after the area, or in this case may have looked after the > cave and the actual painting on the wall. Some of the stories that are > connected to the cave talk about Baiame's arms and why they are so long. The > reason being is because he was believed to be protector of the area and > protector of the people in the district. His eyes also are of large capacity > because it was said also he was all seeing, all knowledge. And everyone > revered [him]. Like they do today they had their own religion and the > Aboriginal religion had the deity figure, Goign or in the other people's > language, Baiame is the figure.'

The band's final line-up consisted of Riefian \\"Ifan\\" Fajarsyah (vocals), Herman Sikumbang (guitar), M. Awal \\"Bani\\" Purbani (bass guitar), and Windu Andi Darmawan (drums). They released six studio albums and fifteen singles. They were known for their hit singles, such as \\"Selalu Mengalah\\", \\"Jaga Selalu Hatimu\\", \\"Jalan Terbaik\\", and \\"Ayah\\". Seventeen was performing in a tent at Tanjung Lesung resort on 22 December 2018 when the Sunda Strait tsunami struck the stage from behind. Bani, Herman, Andi, a crew member, and their on-road manager were killed. Ifan, the only surviving member, announced his solo career. History The band was formed by Yudhi Rus Harjanto, Herman Sikumbang, Zulianto \\"Zozo\\" Angga, and Windu Andi Darmawan who attended a private high school in Yogyakarta. With a serious desire to form a band, they asked M. Awal \\"Bani\\" Purbani, Yudhi's cousin, to join the band. Seventeen was officially formed on January 17, 1999. The band's name, \\"Seventeen\\", was chosen because all of the band members were 17 years old. One year later, Yohan \\"Doni\\" Saputro joined the band to fill the vocalist position. Their debut album, Bintang Terpilih (\\"Selected Stars\\") was released on July 17, 2003 through Universal Music Indonesia. They asked Indonesian MTV VJ at the time, Arie Untung, to duet on their song \\"Jibaku\\". This album managed to achieve sales figures of up to 75,000 copies and some of its songs were used for soap opera soundtracks. But not long ago, their label closed its local division. For the next two years, they did not have a label contract. When the Universal Music local division was reopened, Seventeen immediately returned to signing a contract. They later released their second album, Sweet Seventeen in 2005 with the single \\"Jika Kau Percaya\\" (\\"If You Believe\\"). In 2008, vocalist Doni, drummer Andi, and guitarist Zozo left the band. The remaining band members were confused to find a replacement of Doni for the crucial vocalist position. After going through the audition process, they got Ifan as their new vocalist. The vocal character differences between Doni and Ifan makes a change in Seventeen's genre. Seventeen's third album, Lelaki Hebat (\\"Great Man\\"), was released in 2008 with a drastic change from rock to pop. For their third album, Seventeen released it in the Glodok electronic goods shopping center which has been known as a place for music pirates. After the release of their third album, Andi rejoined as a drummer after previously leaving because he focused on his work as a bank employee. In 2011, the band released their fourth album, Dunia yang Indah (\\"The Beautiful World\\"), with a hit single \\"Jaga Slalu Hatimu\\" (\\"Always Keep Your Heart\\"). In 2013, due to differences in music vision, guitarist Yudhi chose to leave the band when the fifth album Sang Juara (\\"The Champion\\") was going to be released. The album contains two singles, titled \\"Sang Juara\\" and \\"Sumpah Ku Mencintaimu\\" (\\"I Swear I Love You\\"). Three years later, on 31 March 2016, they released their sixth album Pantang Mundur (\\"Persistent\\"). In this album, they worked with music directors for the first time. The album contains 11 tracks including four singles \\"Cinta Jangan Sembunyi\\" (\\"Love Don't Hide\\"), \\"Bukan Main Main\\" (\\"Not Kidding\\"), \\"Aku Gila\\" (I'm Crazy\\"), \\"Menunggu Kamu\\" (\\"Waiting for You\\") and \\"Kemarin\\" (\\"Yesterday\\"). In 2018, they released a new single titled \\"Jangan Dulu Pergi\\" (\\"Don't Go Away\\"), written for the vocalist Ifan's deceased father. Its music video was released on 10 June 2018. It was the last work by the band before it disbanded. Tsunami at Sunda Strait Seventeen was performing at PLN Family Gathering in Tanjung Lesung, Pandeglang, Banten, when an eruption from Anak Krakatau caused a tsunami and suddenly struck the stage from behind. All the members were swept away by the tsunami. Bassist Bani and road manager Oki Wijaya were declared dead at the scene. The body of guitarist Herman was found several hours after being announced as missing. The body of drummer Andi was found one day after being announced as missing. Crew member Rukmana ‚ÄúUjang‚Äù Rustam and vocalist Ifan's wife, actress and TV personality Dylan Sahara, were also killed in the tsunami. Ifan survived the tsunami as the only remaining member of Seventeen. He later announced that the band is now disbanded and he would continue as a solo artist.

Roosevelt and Churchill between themselves drafted an agreement on how liberated France would be governed. They agreed on a merger between Giraud's Algiers Imperial Council and de Gaulle's London-based French National Committee. However Roosevelt's original draft called for General Giraud to be in charge.

Nevertheless it was kept from actually taking a leadership role regarding the UN or Germany.Andrew Williams, \\"France and the Origins of the United Nations, 1944‚Äì1945: 'Si La France ne compte plus, qu‚Äôon nous le dise'.\\" Diplomacy & Statecraft 28.2 (2017): 215-234. The French were angry at not being invited to Potsdam, but they did fairly well in the end.Julian Jackson, Charles de Gaulle (2003) p 39. Algeria 1958 The May 1958 seizure of power in Algiers by French army units and French settlers opposed to concessions in the face of Arab nationalist insurrection ripped apart the unstable Fourth Republic. The National Assembly brought him back to power during the May 1958 crisis. De Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic with a strengthened presidency, and he was elected in the latter role. He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs (Frenchmen settled in Algeria) and the military; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule. He granted independence to Algeria in 1962 and progressively to other French colonies.Winock, Michel. \\"De Gaulle and the Algerian Crisis 1958-1962.\\" in Hugh Gough and John Home, eds., De Gaulle and Twentieth Century France (1994) pp 71-82. French West Africa French West Africa before it broke into smaller independent states. French conservatives were disillusioned with the colonial experience after the disasters in Indochina and Algeria. They wanted to cut all ties to the numerous colonies in French Sub-Saharan Africa. During the war, de Gaulle had successfully based his Free France movement and the African colonies. After a visit in 1958, he made a commitment to make sub- Saharan French Africa a major component of his foreign-policy.Julian Jackson, De Gaulle (2018), pp 490-93, 525, 609-615. All the colonies in 1958, except Guinea, voted to remain in the French Community, with representation in Parliament and a guarantee of French aid. In practice, nearly all the colonies became independent in the late 1950s, but maintained very strong connections.Patrick Manning, Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa 1880‚Äì1995 (1999) pp 137-41, 149-50, 158-62. Under close supervision from the president, French advisors played a major role in civil and military affairs, thwarted coups, and, occasionally, replaced upstart local leaders. The French colonial system had always been based primarily on local leadership, in sharp contrast to the situation in British colonies. The French colonial goal had been to assimilate the natives into mainstream French culture, with a strong emphasis on the French language. From de Gaulle's point of view, close association gave legitimacy to his visions of global client grandeur, certified his humanitarian credentials, provided access to oil, uranium and other minerals, and provided a small but steady market for French manufacturers. Above all it guaranteed the vitality of French language and culture in a large slice of the world that was rapidly growing in population. De Gaulle's successors Georges Pompidou (1969‚Äì74) and Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing (1974-1981) continued de Gaulle's African policy. It was supported with French military units, and a large naval presence in the Indian Ocean. Over 260,000 Frenchmen worked in Africa, focused especially on delivering oil supplies. There was some effort to build up oil refineries and aluminum smelters, but little effort to develop small-scale local industry, which the French wanted to monopolize for the mainland. Senegal, Ivory Coast, Gabon, and Cameroon were the largest and most reliable African allies, and received most of the investments.John R. Frears, France in the Giscard Presidency (1981) pp 109-127. During the Nigerian Civil War (1967‚Äì1970), France supported breakaway Biafra, but only on a limited scale, providing mercenaries and obsolete weaponry. De Gaulle's goals were to protect its nearby ex-colonies from Nigeria, to stop Soviet advances, and to acquire a foothold in the oil-rich Niger delta.Christopher Griffin, \\"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War, 1967‚Äì1970.\\" Small Wars & Insurgencies 26.1 (2015): 114-135. Politics of Grandeur Proclaiming that grandeur was the essential to the nature of France, de Gaulle initiated his \\"Politics of Grandeur\\". He demanded complete autonomy for France in world affairs, which meant that it has its major decisions which could not be forced upon it by NATO, the European Community or anyone else. De Gaulle pursued a policy of \\"national independence.\\" He twice vetoed Britain's entry into the Common Market, fearing it might overshadow France in European affairs.Helen Parr, \\"Saving the Community: The French Response to Britain's Second EEC Application in 1967\\", Cold War History (2006) 6#4 pp 425‚Äì454 While not officially abandoning NATO, he withdraw from its military integrated command, fearing that the United States had too much control over NATO. He launched an independent nuclear development program that made France the fourth nuclear power. Hostile to Anglo-Saxons He restored cordial Franco-German relations in order to create a European counterweight between the \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" (American and British) and Soviet spheres of influence. De Gaulle openly criticised the U.S. intervention in Vietnam. He was angry at American economic power, especially what his Finance minister called the \\"exorbitant privilege\\" of the U.S. dollar. He went to Canada and proclaimed \\"Vive le Qu√©bec libre\\", The catchphrase for an independent Quebec.See Wayne C. Thompson, Canada 2014 (2013) Partial withdrawal from NATO in 1966 De Gaulle's vision called for a strong, independent France, armed with nuclear weapons, expecting that his vigor and weapons would enable Paris to deal with Washington on equal terms. Europe should emancipate itself from America and become a third force in the Cold War where it could rally neutral nations and perhaps reach a d√©tente with the Soviet Union. NATO stood in the way of these goals. De Gaulle protested at the strong role of the United States in NATO. He considered the \\"special relationship\\" between the U.S. and the UK to be too close and too detrimental to the French role in Europe. The existing NATO situation gave the United States a veto power a nuclear weapons and thus prevented France from having a fully independent nuclear force of its own. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he proposed a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with them. He also wanted NATO's coverage to expand to include French Algeria, where France was waging a counter-insurgency and sought NATO assistance.Anand Menon, France, NATO, and the limits of independence, 1981‚Äì97 (2000) p 11. De Gaulle's ideas went nowhere, so he began the development of an Force de dissuasion (an independent French nuclear force). He refused to sign the 1963 agreement against underground nuclear testing. In 1963 he vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC (the European Union). No NATO countries followed his lead. In July 1964, de Gaulle presented West Germany with a clear choice: \\"Either you [West Germany] follow a policy subordinated to the US or you adopt a policy that is European and independent of the U.S., but not hostile to them.\\" West Germany rejected de Gaulle's ultimatum by pledging total loyalty to the U.S. ending his plan for leadership of Europe. In 1966-67 he withdrew France from NATO's military structure‚Äîwhich required an American to be in command of any NATO military action. He expelled NATO's headquarters and NATO units from French soil.Garret Martin, \\"The 1967 withdrawal from NATO‚Äìa cornerstone of de Gaulle's grand strategy?.\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies 9.3 (2011): 232-243. The 15 NATO partners did not ignore De Gaulle's threats. Instead they worked to more closely cooperate with one to neutralize his countermeasures.Christian Nuenlist, \\"Dealing with the devil: NATO and Gaullist France, 1958‚Äì66.\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies 9.3 (2011): 220-231. France officially remained a NATO member and finally in 2009 President Nicolas Sarkozy ended France's estrangement from NATO, closing the Gaullist chapter. James Ellison explains why Western Europe rejected de Gaulle's vision: :he antagonised his allies in the EEC [European Community] and in the Atlantic Alliance and he worked against the prevailing political atmosphere in the West. That atmosphere ....was a general belief in interdependence and integration and their achievement through a reformed NATO and Atlantic Alliance and an advancing EEC. During the second half of the 1960s, independence and national sovereignty became outmoded and it was amid de Gaulle‚Äôs pursuit of them that this became clear.James Ellison, \\"Separated by the Atlantic: the British and de Gaulle, 1958‚Äì1967\\" in In de Gaulle's very long-term perspective, all that really mattered was the nation state, not ideologies that come and go such as communism. That is the good relationship of the French state and the Russian state had a higher priority than petty issues such as socialism and capitalism. Breaking through the polarization of the Cold War would allow France to assume a major leadership role in the world. The polarization was furthermore illegitimate, since France had been excluded from Yalta and the other episodes in which the Cold War had been established in 1945-47. By now, he was confident, there was no risk of a European war, and the Soviet Union had so many internal troubles that it was ready for d√©tente. It had split bitterly with China and the two were now engaged in a global battle for control of local Communist movements. His diplomats opened informal discussions with Romania, Bulgaria and Poland. Moscow, however, was so alarmed at de Gaulle's suggestion that the Soviet satellites should show some independence of their own. When Czechoslovakia did show independence, Moscow and its client states invaded and crushed the new government there in 1968. D√©tente was dead as were de Gaulle's grandiose plans.Martin, \\"The 1967 withdrawal from NATO‚Äìa cornerstone of de Gaulle's grand strategy?.\\" pp. 238-243. Evaluations French scholar Alfred Grosser has evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of de Gaulle's foreign policy. On the positive side, the highest praise goes to a restoration of French grandeur in rank in world affairs, a return to a historic ranking. The French themselves are especially pleased with this development. As Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville told the National Assembly in 1964: France has resumed her position in all sectors of world affairs.\\"Alfred Grosser, French foreign policy under De Gaulle (1967) p 129. There is little dissent with this conclusion inside France, even from de Gaulle's old enemies. However, the rest of the world looks at the claim with some amusement, as de Gaulle has not restored the diplomatic reputation of Paris in Washington, London, or Moscow nor in Beijing, New Delhi, Tokyo, Bonn and Rome. West Germany remained much more closely aligned with the United States in major world affairs, especially regarding NATO. When Soviet control of Eastern Europe collapsed in 1989, the United States led the effort to reunite Germany, despite serious French doubts. Secondly, France did establish its independence of the Anglo-Saxon powers ‚Äì especially the United States, and also Great Britain. De Gaulle's anti-American rhetoric did indeed rub Americans the wrong way, and give some encouragement to intellectuals hostile to Americanism.Kulski, pp 77‚Äì79.James Chace and Elizabeth Malkin, ‚ÄòThe Mischief-Maker: The American Media and De Gaulle, 1964‚Äì1968‚Äô, in Robert O. Paxton and Nicholas Wahl, eds., De Gaulle and the United States (1994), 359‚Äì76. His pulling the French military out of NATO was basically a symbolic action, with few practical results. It did mean that NATO headquarters was relocated to Belgium, with the result that French generals gave up their voice in NATO policy. Most historians conclude that NATO grew stronger, and de Gaulle had failed to weaken it or lessen American dominance. As long as de Gaulle was in power, he successfully blocked British entry into the European Union. When he retired, so too was that exclusionary policy. Grosser concludes that the enormous French effort to become independent of Washington in nuclear policy by building its own \\"force de frappe\\" has been a failure. The high budget cost came at the expense of weakening France's conventional military capabilities. Neither Washington nor Moscow pays much attention to the French nuclear deterrent one way or another. As a neutral force in world affairs, France does have considerable influence over its former colonies--Much more than any other ex-colonial power. But the countries involved are not powerhouses, and the major neutral nations at the time, such as India, Yugoslavia and Indonesia, paid little attention to Paris.Kulski, pp 314‚Äì320. He did not have a major influence at the United Nations.Kulski, pp 321‚Äì389. While the French people supported and admired the foreign policy of Charles de Gaulle--at the time and in retrospect--he made it all himself with scant regard to French public or elite opinion.Grosser, French foreign policy under De Gaulle (1967) pp 128‚Äì144.Kulski, pp 37‚Äì38.

Background  The Oregon Hops and Brewing Archives are unique in that it intertwines the history of hops and beer, as well as uniting and contextualizing the social and cultural aspects of brewing. They focus on materials related to the regional hops and barley farming, craft and home brewing, cider, mead, and the Oregon State University (OSU) research on hops and brewing that dates to the 1890s. Housed at OSU's Special Collections and Archives Research Center (SCARC) in Corvallis, Oregon, OHBA contains the archives of brewers and breweries from the Pacific Northwest, as well as an extensive oral history collection. The physical and digital collections are curated by Tiah Edmunson-Morton and serve not only as a collecting initiative, but also as an educational initiative to encourage people to preserve their ongoing work. Edmunson-Morton argues that people underestimate the importance of what they've created, especially craft brewers, when in reality they are contributing to the history of American beer. Oregon State University (OSU) began planting and experimenting with hops as early as 1893. Dr. Alfred Haunold influenced modern and popular hop varieties through his work with food studies. The Fermentation Science Program established itself in 1995 and further aided the study of hops and brewing at Oregon State, followed by the creation of the Oregon Hops and Brewing Archives in 2013.  Methods  OHBA is a community archive, and its collections come from donations. These donations include a variety of items, from beer lists and promotional posters to business records and photographs. Digitized collections also make up a portion of OHBA, whether it be the collections themselves or publications about hops and brewing. Community archiving makes up a large part of OHBA and works to keep the archive local to the Pacific Northwest. Archivists work with these local hops and brewing communities to document their work and experiences. Materials of interest include technical and legal documents, press releases, marketing materials, recipes, as well as practice and production methods. Additional collecting items include information related to figures in the brewing industry such as biographical information, and OHBA conducts many oral history interviews with members of the local hops and brewing community.  Hops and Brewing Publications and Newsletters  Various Hops and Brewing Publications and Newsletters are all housed within the OHBA archives and Oregon State University Library and cover a span from 1895 to present. The contents range from notable brewing publications, to technical information and reputable books on the subject. Some notable highlights from the Brewing Publication Collections include All About Beer (issues from 1979-2014), Oregon Beer Growler (issued from 2010‚Äìpresent), and American Brewer (issues from 1957-2013). OHBA also houses hop publications, which vary from the Oregon Hop Grower and The Pacific Hop Grower (issues from 1933-1940) to The Hopper (issues from 1945-1954).  Collections  The Oregon Hops and Brewing Archives contains the collections of over 45 of people and organizations. Aside from personal collections and papers, OHBA contains oral histories as well as hops and brewing newsletters and publications  People, businesses, and groups  Some notable people represented through the OHBA collections include: Fred Eckhardt, homebrewer and pioneer in the field of beer journalism, Godfrey R. Hoerner, a specialist in hop production, and Pete Dunlop, author of Portland Beer: Crafting the Road to Beervana. Furthermore, OHBA's collections include that of notable businesses in Pacific Northwest Brewing. These include the records of Barley's Angel's, an organization dedicated to helping women in craft brewing by establishing chapters across the country, and the records of the Hop Growers of America Records, which is an organization founded with the purpose of increasing and improving knowledge on hops. The Oregon Hops and Brewing Archives contain collections of noteworthy brewing organizations from Oregon. These include archival material from McMenamins Brewery Collection, Ninkasi Brewing Company Collection, and the Zoller Hop Company Records. Oral histories The oral histories are a unique aspect of OHBA's archival collections is its extensive collection of oral history interviews, conducted from 2014 to 2019. Some notable interviews from each year has been included.  2014  * Teri Fahrendorf: One of the first female brewers in the Pacific Northwest * Dr. Alfred Haunold: released the Cascade, Willamette, Sterling, Liberty, Mt.

The precinct was built from 1856. It includes the HMAS Kuttabul naval base, formerly known as HMAS Penguin. The property is owned by Australian Department of Defence. It was added to the Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 and the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 November 2004.  History  The Garden Island Naval Precinct, incorporates Fleet Base East, including the Garden Island Dockyard and adjacent facility Sydney Maritime Headquarters (MHQ) at Potts Point. The precinct is the main naval base in Australia and has the largest repair and refitting dockyard in Australia. Originally established as a British naval Depot, the island developed slowly from the early colonial days, with the greatest spurt occurring during World War II. This period saw massive building programs including the construction of the Captain Cook Graving Dock and land reclamation by 1945 that joined the island to the mainland at Potts Point. The dock was then the largest of its kind in the southern hemisphere. The Garden Island facility was for a long period known as HMAS Penguin, after the survey vessel, later depot ship, built in 1876. The Garden Island establishment was commissioned at HMAS Penguin until 1 January 1943.Frame, 1990. At this time, the base was renamed HMAS Kuttabul in memory of the loss of that depot ship in the Japanese attack of Sydney Harbour. Ba-ing-hoe and Derawan, pre-1788 to the 1820s The topographical formations now known as Garden Island and Potts Point first became recognisable features in the Sydney Harbour landscapes about 6,500 years ago when sea levels stabilised at their current levels. The Cadigal people came to know them by the names of Ba-ing-hoe and Derawan.Attenbrow, 2002. In June 2004 the NSW Government announced an initiative to reintroduce a dual naming policy for such significant landforms. Over the following few thousand years, the harbour's Aboriginal population gradually increased, developed significant technologies (such as fish-hook making), raw material utilisation (such as recovering shells for tool making), and maximised estuarine food resources from rocky shorelines, such as shellfish. Within 2‚Äì3 years of the arrival of the British in 1788, the Cadigal people's patterns of life were increasingly difficult to sustain, due to conflict, loss of resources, disease and the attractions of developing colonial towns. In 1791 it was reported that only three Cadigal people remained alive after a smallpox epidemic.Turbet, 2001: 21. Others have questioned this rapid demise when, for example, in 1795 it was reported that a large number of people had gathered in Farm Cove, only west of the Precinct, for an initiation ceremony. The island itself must have had some significant connections to certain Aboriginal people, and was known to have been the scene of early armed conflict between local Aboriginal (probably Cadigal) men and British soldiers in 1788. Cadigal use of the island was not recorded by colonial observers, although other Aboriginal associations were reported. The story of Bungaree's death on the island is notable and has been explored by several writers. Although from Broken Bay, \\"King\\" Bungaree was recognised by Governor Macquarie as the \\"Supreme Chief of the Sydney Tribes\\",Sydney Gazette, 27 November 1830. and was a well known and respected figure around Sydney. Bungaree had accompanied Matthew Flinders on several of his voyages along the east coast, the Torres Strait and the Gulf of Carpentaria between 1799 and 1803. He travelled with King in 1819,McBryde, 33 so was probably the first Aboriginal person to have circumnavigated Australia (although not in a single voyage). Macquarie's last vice-regal act was to arrange for Bungaree to be given a boat and net so that he could engage in commercial fishing.Horton, 164 In late 1830 Bungaree was admitted to the General Hospital, and after being sick for some time asked to be taken to Garden Island to die. The 'King's' wish was granted and on 27 November 1830 he died surrounded by \\"his own tribe, as well as that of Darling Harbour'. A coffin was sent to the island from the government lumber yard, and it was reported that Bungaree was to be buried in Rose Bay next to one of his queens, possibly Matora. Frame argues that Bungaree was taken to die on the island in appreciation of his services to the Royal Navy in assisting Flinders and other navigators. Attenbrow states that by the 1820s the original ways of life of the Cadigal had been lost, although descendants of the Cadigal of 1788 still remained in Sydney. By the 1820s, Ba- ing-hoe and Derawan had become well known in Sydney by the English names of Garden Island and Paddy's Point,Pollon, 208 and colonial forces were beginning the shape the precinct. The search for a naval depot, 1788‚Äì1856 On 5 February 1788 Governor Phillip granted Ba-ing-hoe to the ships' company of for their use as a garden. On 11 February 1788 a party of men was sent to Garden Island for that purpose. From this time the island became known as \\"Garden Island\\", although Sirius Island and Sirius Garden Island had some limited use. Conflict with the local Cadigal people began at this time when, on 18 February, 17 Aboriginal men (probably Cadigal), landed on the island and collected some of the garden tools lying around. The Royal Marines fired small shot at their legs, forcing them to drop some of the tools before they got away back to the mainland. Thus, within weeks of the First Fleet's arrival, the island had become a microcosm of the future of relations between Aboriginal people and their colonisers. Even more tangible evidence of the invasion of the Cadigal domain was provided by some of the early gardeners when three men carved their initials into a rock on the island's northern hill: \\"FM\\", \\"IR\\" and \\"WB\\" with the year \\"1788\\". The men were clearly staking a visual, if unofficial, claim to English control of the land. The garden continued to be cultivated until the loss of HMS Sirius on Norfolk Island in 1790. Although gardening flourished for some time, the new name of the island, and its associations with the navy, became a permanent reminder if its history since 1788. In 1789, the Row Boat Guard was established to patrol the harbour for smugglers, and a watch house was built on the island, but later transferred to Watsons Bay because of a lack of fresh water. In 1796 the island was transferred to the company of , and a house was built with convict labour ‚Äì the first permanent structure on the island. In 1799 a gun battery was established on the island's northern hummock, and between 1800 and 1806 the island was possibly used as a lazaret or quarantine station, but the Royal Navy never relinquished its claims to the island. In 1800 the company of gained control of the island, and a Dr Brandt, with his pet dog and baboon ‚Äì which became an attraction for local Sydneysiders to visit the island ‚Äì lived in the convict house. In April 1803 the Sydney Gazette reported that an Aboriginal man had been shot dead when a party of Aboriginal and white men in canoes and dinghies landed on the island and raided the gardens. A succession of Royal Navy ships companies occupied the island, using it mainly to grow vegetables and fruit for the ship kitchens until 1810 when arrived in Sydney with a new Governor, Lachlan Macquarie. Within a few months of Macquarie's arrival, he had a notice published in the Gazette stating that Garden Island was now part of the Governor's Domain, that all produce of the island was now the Governor's, and prohibited the setting of fires on the island. Thus the island was removed from naval jurisdiction and made part of the vice-regal estates. This action was not contested by the Royal Navy, which was busy with the American War (1812) and the Napoleonic Wars that ended in 1815, and it was not until 1821 that the stationing of Royal Navy ships in Sydney was resumed. By that time the island was considered part of the Domain, and often visited by the public. In 1821 it was proposed to build a monument to the late Princess of Wales on the island. In 1825 the remains of Judge Advocate Ellis Bent were exhumed from the George Street Cemetery (now the site of Sydney Town Hall) and re-interred in a tomb on the island, and in 1826 Bent's close friend, Major John Ovens, was also entombed on the island. A contemporary wrote in 1842 that \\"they wished to lay their bones on this little isle, where they had so often wandered to contemplate and admire the beauties of nature\\". The tomb was located on the southern hummock in a \\"sylvan glade\\". In 1827 the tomb was plundered by thieves for the lead of the coffins, and in 1886 the remains were relocated to St Thomas' churchyard in North Sydney. Three years after the entombment, king Bungaree was brought to die on the island (see above). During the 1830s-1850s, the Sydney press often referred to the island's natural beauty in the harbour, and the general public seemed to have made use of the island for rambling and other recreational pursuits, but the lack of suitable boats for tourists hindered their visiting, and eventually became a reason for returning the island to naval control. By the 1850s, the potential for the island as a place of remembrance and public resort was about to end. Developing a naval depot, 1856‚Äì1914 Between the 1820s and 1850s, the size of the Royal Navy greatly contracted at a time when the extent of the British Empire continued to grow. At the same time, the technologies of shipping, both naval and merchant, underwent great change with the introduction of steam and the use of steel cladding, to mention just two. The navy continued to be subject to pressures in reducing expenditures, continued to regard the Australasian colonies as offshoots of its East Indies stations, and remained unconvinced as to the value of extensive harbour defence systems. In addition, the imperial authorities in London were coming to a view that the cost of colonial defences should be at least partly born by the colonies. Within New South Wales the view was somewhat different. The expansion of the wool industry and the gold rushes showed Australia was more than a stopping point between the Pacific and Indian oceans, and the use of Sydney as a base during the Maori Wars in New Zealand emphasised its strategic role. At the same time the agitation for, and then the granting of, responsible government to NSW in 1856 resulted in the elected colonial politicians campaigning for the use of Sydney Harbour as a base for the Royal Navy in the South Pacific. The Navy's then use of Fort Macquarie as its main residence was not secure due to that site's co-use as part of the Sydney Harbour military defence system. Naval agitation to secure a more secure tenure led to requests of the NSW Government to set aside Garden Island as a purely naval preserve. Debate continued over the need to set aside portions of its northern end for harbour defence purposes and to limit naval building in these areas. The Navy took control of the island in 1858 at a time that coincided with the development of the separate British fleet, the \\"Australia Station\\" ‚Äì to guard against aggression by external naval forces. Garden Island became the base for the flotilla. A survey of the island by crew from provides a unique insight into the undeveloped nature of the island and the logistical difficulties of establishing the base. Commodore Loring became the first commander of the Australia Station on 26 March 1859 with his flagship . From 1860‚Äì1864 little progress was made at Garden Island although the presence of some buildings, roads and a slip were noted. Finally in 1865, despite continual changes to the inferred area to be incorporated into naval control, a portion of Garden Island was officially gazetted for sole naval use (10 January 1865). The Colonial Naval Defence Act of 1865 allowed for the colonies to form their own navies and to train crew, and cemented the Sydney base as the chief naval station in Australia. Significantly on 5 June 1866 the entire portion of Garden Island was gazetted as a Naval Depot, finally reflecting the initial discussions and offer of Garden Island for that purpose, back in 1856. Defence requirements continued and a new gun battery in a sunken gun pit was opened on the northern hill in 1871. Significant building work on the island did not commence until 1885 when the British Admiralty's engineer James Fishenden was sent out from England to plan and oversee works. This saw the levelling of the southern \\"hummock\\" of the island, forever changing its visual appearance. The fill deposited onto the southern side increased the land area by 3 acres. 1885 saw the appointment of Rear Admiral Tryon which raised the Australia Station to Flag rank status. A combined Rigging Shed and Sail Loft was to be commenced first, with the foundations of the Rigging Workshop, Kitchen Block, Anchor Store, Chain Store, Factory Workshop and Spar Shed laid in 1886. Two stone slipways were also commenced on the eastern side of the Sail Loft in 1887 and the Barracks Building initiated that same year. The Barracks consisted of three levels of Tuscan columned verandas with a symmetrical arrangement, and the second level serving as Fleet Hospital (see also Rivett, 1999: 5-9). The building served as accommodation for crews on the Australia Station vessels. At this time the eastern seawall was two-thirds complete. Building works continued slowly and the Sail Loft and Rigging Shed was not formally acquired by the Admiralty until 1889. This followed years of debate over funding and negotiations with the NSW Government. Colonial Architect James Barnet was involved with drafting the plans for the Rigging Shed and Barracks Building. A contract to build the urgently Naval Store was finally let on 26 July 1892 to Howie Brothers, after contracts were let in 1891, and the work was completed early in 1894 for a sum of . The building comprised a four-storey (semi- basement and three upper floors) late Victorian Warehouse of load-bearing polychrome bricks with sandstone string courses, cornices, sills, copings and granite thresholds to doors. The building is divided into five fire separated compartments by vertical cross walls. Within each section are two rows of circular cast iron columns supporting iron girders, timber joists and a 50mm tallowwood floor. The ground floor was paved with Val-de-Travers asphalt 38mm thick. Plan dimensions of the building are approximately 64m x 39m. The building is located next to the eastern side of Building 88. Lightly framed wrought iron roof trusses span between the masonry walls and support the roof. Originally corrugated galvanised iron, the roof has been corrugated asbestos cement and is currently zincalume. To service the stores, five externally mounted wrought iron whips were provided above the large arched doorways on the northern side. Between these doorways and around the rest of the building are numerous windows of varying size. The timber framed double hung windows have 2 and 4 light sashes. In the centre of the northern and southern parapet, carved in sandstone is the Royal cypher of Queen Victoria and the date 1893. The original water operated hydraulic plant consisted of engines, accumulators, five hoists (whips) and two lifts. The lifts have since been electrified with light motor rooms projecting above the roof level. The accumulator, originally planned to be located in Building 95 is now located in the western bay of Building 89. Additions (Buildings 87 and 90) have been constructed on the southern and eastern sides. Architectural Style: Victorian Warehouse.National Trust Other building work included the semi-detached residences completed in 1896, the Barracks and Kitchen wing in 1889, the battery shed, factory and workshop in 1891, the naval stores complex in 1894, the main offices in 1895, further residences and the core shop in 1895, and the boat shed in 1896. That year saw the entire Garden Island depot completed and handed over to Rear Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge, Commander-in-Chief, on behalf of the Admiralty. The Royal Australian Navy now finally had an established base. Supporting the Australia Station, 1895‚Äì1914 Consolidation of the base was a feature of this period with specialist staff brought out from England and labour recruited locally, including civilians. 1900 saw Australia's participation in the Boxer Rebellion, particularly the New South Wales Naval Brigade and the conversion to troopship at Garden Island of the steamship SS Salamis. 1901 saw the vessels and personnel from the former Colonial navies transferred to the Commonwealth on 1 March 1901 with the proclamation of the Australian Commonwealth. Australia signed the Naval Agreement with Britain in 1903 which continued Royal Navy vessels as part of the Australia Station, although supported with a financial subsidy. Building work during this period included the construction of a Naval Prison with plans initially drawn up by the Colonial Architect back in 1888. The work was substantially complete by 1905. 1902 had seen part of the Sail Loft partitioned off to form a Naval Chapel, and various minor additions were added for this use, including a prisoners' gallery. The ownership question of Garden Island was raised again at the end of the decade with Britain's intention to withdraw vessels on the Australia Station due to the Australian Government's moves to determine its own naval policy. The NSW State Government believed the Commonwealth, once it took ownership, should pay it for the building works performed. The withdrawal of British fleet support for Australia was widely debated in the media at the time. In 1908 the arrival of the US Great White Fleet caused alarm in Sydney due to its ability to \\"surprise\\" the local population. The Garden Island base was used to support the fleet of sixteen battleships during their week's stay. German strength in the Pacific raised further alarm and the Imperial Conference on Naval Affairs held in 1909 led the British to develop a Pacific Fleet, the Australian Station component being funded and manned entirely by Australia. Garden Island was formally handed over from the British Admiralty to the Commonwealth Government in 1913 and coincided with the establishment of the first wholly owned and operated Royal Australian Navy. The Island would become increasingly vital to maintain and support the vessels. This fleet was headed by the new Indefatigable-class battlecruiser HMAS Australia which was constructed from 1910 and arrived amidst much fanfare with other fleet units on 4 October 1913. Their entry to Port Jackson initiated the tradition of the naval fleet review. The fleet also comprised the light cruisers , and the aging , the torpedo boat destroyers , and , and the two submarines and (which did not arrive until 1914). Operating a naval depot, 1914‚Äì1990 During World War I (1914‚Äì1918) Garden Island was the principal naval asset for the fitting out and arming of transports and troopships. Some 79 vessels were refitted and repaired at the facility with 852 ship visits including service to Australian naval vessels, Royal Navy, and that of France and Japan. 1917 saw a major union dispute on the island which had a potential significant impact on war production and services. The dispute arose out of the introduction of the American \\"Taylor\\" system of job cards and involved much of the eastern States. The island played a unique part in naval history in 1914 when it served as the base of Australia's first submarine flotilla. HMAS AE1 and AE2, British E-class submarines, were based there until AE1 was lost near Rabaul in 1914 and AE2 famously near Gallipoli during the Dardanelles Campaign of 1915. These were also the first submarines in the Southern Hemisphere and attracted significant public attention. The end of the war did not lead to an immediate downturn in work at Garden Island as the many merchant ships fitted out as troop ships had to be reconverted. However, from 1920 onwards, significant reduction in labour and reorganisation of the Dockyard to achieve efficiencies were a feature. A Royal Commission was established by the Commonwealth Government in 1921 to assess the needs and future uses of both the Garden Island facility and Cockatoo Island Dockyard, which always generated competing debate. The report concluded that there was insufficient work to keep both establishments fully employed and Cockatoo was transferred to the control of the Prime Minister's Department on 1 July 1921. The Royal Commission had the effect of restricting expansion or development at Garden Island which witnessed continued large staff reductions. The 1920s-1930s was a volatile time for the security of naval control over Garden Island. Earlier debates about its ownership were reopened when, post-war, the New South Wales State Government, through its State Crown Lands Consolidation Act of 1913, contended its rights over control. The State argued that the RAN's use of the island was inconsistent with the original 1865 and 1866 Declarations which were for the purpose only of a naval depot for the Royal Navy. On 12 October 1923 the State Government formally revoked the earlier dedications and by 1924 issued an ultimatum to the Commonwealth for possession of the island, or a declaration of that entitlement, plus claims for profits owed for its use. The High Court upheld the State's claim though severely criticised it for taken such actions. The Commonwealth deferred any decision and by mid-1919 NSW Premier Jack Lang demanded payment for the island's use from October 1923 and a timeline for the Commonwealth abandonment of the site. A change of Federal Government stalled the issue further. The State's 1932 land valuation was contested and a recommendation made by the Department of Defence to buy the island outright for a reduced sum, partly due to the benefit the facility provided to the State in terms of labour, major works, and the associated facilities in Sydney Harbour that would close with the abandonment of Garden Island. As these debates continued the functioning efficiency of the island further dwindled with much of the machinery obsolete or worn out from wartime work. World economic downturn played a significant part as the Great Depression took hold. Late 1930s world political events led to a re-assessment of the need for Australia's national naval defence and the importance of facilities such as Garden Island. A major obstacle was the lack of sufficient docking facilities for large capital ships, particularly the availability of a graving dock. In 1938, the Federal Cabinet approved, in principle, the construction of an Australian naval graving dock. 3 September 1939 saw Australia at war with Germany. On 1 May 1940, Prime Minister Robert Menzies tabled plans for construction of the graving dock in parliament. As Tom Frame notes, construction of the graving dock and ancillary equipment such as cranes, \\"would be the greatest engineering feat in Australia's history, surpassing even the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It would involve the reclamation of thirty acres between Potts Point and Garden Island\\". Work on the graving dock commenced from 1940 to 1942 when work was undertaken night and day following the fall of Singapore and loss of facilities there. A special sandstone quarry was opened up at Balls Head to supply stone for the cofferdam. The dock gates, or caissons were designed by Vickers Armstrong in the UK and built by the Sydney Steel Company Pty Ltd. They included steel capable of building a ship and were viewed as the most difficult welding project ever conducted in Australia up to that time. World War Two saw a reinstatement of the critical value of Garden Island to national defence and the facility immediately undertook extensive vessel repairs and modification work. The importance of the facility was demonstrated on 31 May 1942 when the Japanese Imperial Navy attacked Sydney Harbour with a fleet of five I-class ocean going submarines and three midget's. The principle targets were the heavy ships in port at that time, including the cruiser USS Chicago tied up at No.2 Buoy on the eastern side of Garden Island. While the raid was a failure with no significant losses, bar two of the midget submarines, the island Depot Ship, the ex-ferry , was destroyed by torpedo alongside Garden Island, killing 21 sailors. The importance of this tragedy is remembered with a commemorative plaque on the eastern side of Garden Island, annual commemoration ceremonies at that historic spot and the naming of the HMAS Kuttabul base. The Dutch submarine K-IX was also damaged by the explosion while a second torpedo ran ashore on the island and failed to explode.HO; No Cause for Alarm, 2002: 23 Dockyard Torpedo Depot staff undertook the dangerous disarming task. 1944 was a significant year with the Commonwealth Government formally acquiring Garden Island from the New South Wales Government for after having resumed the land under wartime regulations in 1939. The graving dock was by this time almost complete. On 2 March 1945 the British aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious required urgent repairs and entered the dock three weeks prior to its opening. Officially opened on 24 March 1945, the dock was named in honour of Captain James Cook RN, with the celebratory ribbon cut by the bow of the frigate HMAS Lachlan. By war's end, the dock had accommodated some of the most famous British battleships and carriers, HMS Indomitable, HMS Duke of York, HMS Implacable, HMS Indefatigable, HMS King George V, Illustrious and HMS Formidable, and serviced its largest guest, the battleship HMS HMS Anson of . Post World War Two, industrial relations issues came to the fore between dockyard workers and managers. The 1975 formal recognition of the Garden Island Combined Union Shop Committee (CUSC) representing 13 unions, provided a level of stability. In March 1977, then Minister for Defence, James Killen, announced a planning team to examine the modification of the Dockyard and Fleet Base. Apart from efficiencies of space and traffic movement, the plan sought to address the need to retain and preserve historic buildings and artefacts on site. The modernisation program was completed in mid-1990, transforming the appearance of the base. The importance of Garden Island rose from 1987 when then Minister for Defence, Kim Beazley announced the Government's intention to sell its interest in the Williamstown Dockyard, Cockatoo Island (other than for submarine refit), while the State Dockyard at Newcastle was also to go. This activity was in part to pay for a huge fleet modernisation program including the purchase of the Collins-class submarines and Anzac-class frigates. In 1988 the Hawke Government corporatised Garden Island into the new Commonwealth-owned company, Australian Defence Industries (ADI).Stevens 246 Garden Island became the only Government-owned and operated dockyard in Australia, and was set on a cost-recovery basis, including provision for undertaking commercial contracts. Hammerhead Crane associated with the Captain Cook Dock On part of the reclaimed land there is a dock and a complex of buildings on the western side of Garden Island and on the eastern edge of Woolloomooloo Bay. The crane occupies a length of on the fitting out wharf about two thirds along the Captain Cook Dock, beyond the boundary of Garden Island itself. Although the crane is incorporated into the wharf, it is disconnected from it by expansion joints on either side of its abutment with the wharf. The Hammerhead Crane has dominated the skyline since it was built. In 1966 the crane was the largest crane in the southern hemisphere and remains the largest dockside crane in Australia. Like the dockyard itself, it was engineered to the extremes of likely demand and represented the contingency approach to naval support planning in the aftermath of the two World Wars. Tenders for the crane were called in 1944 and construction occurred 1944‚Äì51. The Sydney Steel Company was contracted to fabricate and erect the crane to the design of Sir William Arrol, with Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners as consultants. All mechanical and electrical equipment came from England and all structural steelwork was fabricated and erected by the Sydney Steel Company. The crane's main function was the removal and refitting of gun turrets to warships. It was last used in 1988 for heavy lifting of power station stators (the cores of electrical generators). Upon completion in February 1952, the New South Wales Minister for Works, Joseph Cahill, drove in the final rivet to complete the edifice. According to an undated brochure published by the Navy, the Hammerhead Crane first came into use in March 1951. According to the specification, all fabricated steelwork had to be assembled and then trial erected to check the faring of holes and camber of booms. At the time of trial erection of the cantilever and during preliminary checking for camber, it was found impracticable to build the cantilever the right way up as this would have necessitated a great deal of shoring because the jib tapered from in the centre to at the nose. It was then decided to build the cantilever upside down as the top chord only had a camber of 20.7 cm (8.5/32in). Pre-cast concrete blocks were placed at each panel to give the correct camber and trial erection then proceeded satisfactorily: all splices being 60% pinned and bolted using parallel pins so as not to damage the holes. After the trial erection ended, the structure was dismantled and transported to the site for final erection. Work commenced on the foundation cylinders in August 1944 (each of the four cylinders were named (A to D). In March 1945 the precast sections B and D each weighing were lifted and placed in their prepared guides using the floating crane Titan. They proved watertight but were extremely lively in the water, the slightest wash from a passing launch causing them to strike heavily against their staging. Work on the foundations continued but water penetration of cylinders A and C became a concern caused by general seepage and then by small leaks. By 19 August 1946, the Engineer in Chief reported: \\"Water was coming in fairly rapidly\\" and on 24 August two divers worked in relays plugging the leak, but the depth was great and the job was not successful. Divers working in of water could only generally work for a total time of 2 hours 50 minutes in tw The main use of the crane has been in the removal and refitting of gun turrets. The crane comprises an asymmetric horizontal steel boom, radius , swiveling on a square section steel tower. The maximum lift is , although a subsidiary crane on the boom is able to lift up to . The crane has been decommissioned.  Description  The Precinct consists of Garden Island, the tip of Potts Point, the reclaimed area linking the island and the point, and part of the eastern shoreline of Woolloomooloo Bay. The island and the point are high points above sea level of the drowned river valley that now forms Sydney Harbour, which was itself formed between 10,000 and 6,500 years ago as sea levels rose following the last glaciation. The island and point are essentially composed of sandstone, and in 1788 were both vegetated with low coastal heath and woodland formations. The island had hummocks at its north (24metres high) and south (20 metres) ends, with a lower flat between them until substantial re-forming began in 1885 as part of the development of the naval base. The narrow strait between the island at the mainland was filled in during World War Two to provide further naval facilities, notably a graving dock, and all of the shorelines in the precinct have been substantially covered and reshaped by the construction of seawalls, docks and other facilities since the 1880s. Most buildings in the Precinct were built in the 1880s and 1890s. The Captain Cook Graving Dock was built during World War Two, linking the Island to the mainland. Of further interest and worth are sandstone carvings of 1788, the Signal Station and the Royal Australian Navy Historical Collection. The timber figurehead of Queen Victoria is off the clipper ship Windsor Castle, which was launched in 1869, and was carved to represent Queen Victoria dressed in regalia. When the ship was sold to become a coal hulk in Sydney Harbour, its master Captain William Cargill put the figurehead in the garden of his house. Discovered years later by Dr C Morris, who presented it to Garden Island. It also features a carved timber figurehead of a woman from the clipper ship Consuela, built in 1880s and which traded to Australia, which is on display for public viewing. The Small Dockyard Steam Crane designed for operation on railway lines similar to those once used on the railways system. Individual buildings Secretariat The Secretariat is a three storeyed Victorian Georgian stuccoed brick building moulded to simulate sandstone, hipped slate roof built in 1887. Three storey verandah to three sides supported on cast iron pillars imported from Britain and also support upper floors of interior. Designed as barracks by Barnet. Essentially colonial Georgian design; twelve pane windows and four panel doors. Were large coolrooms underneath, now distilled water plant. Kitchen block: built of brick, stuccoed to represent stone, slate roof, small pane windows.RNE Rigging Shed and Naval Chapel Stained glass window in the Naval Chapel, pictured in 2006. Separately-listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List, the Rigging Shed and Naval Chapel is a two-storey Victorian Italianate stuccoed brick building having stone sills, arches and columns, with original timber beams replaced by steel. It was originally built as a rigging shed based on 1790 Admiralty plans. It is the oldest building on the island. The sail loft was converted into a chapel in 1902, with stained glass windows installed from the original chapel, which had been built in 1891. The original loft floor of timber remains caulked with oakum and bitumen, access being by exterior timber stairs. Facades have recessed bays. The Chapel incorporates a unique stained glass commemorative window to Australia's first two submarines, AE1 and AE2, based at the Island and lost at Rabaul (1914) and near Gallipoli (1915) respectively. The facades have recessed bays with small arched windows and large doorways with timber sliding doors. Walls are brick, stuccoed and ruled to resemble ashlar stonework. The roof has a double hipped form and, originally clad with corrugated iron, was re-clad with corrugated asbestos and has since returned to corrugated iron; there are raised central ridge lights. An arched brick spine wall helps support the first floor, which is also supported by rolled and wrought iron girders. The timber floor of the first floor is still caulked with oakham and bitumen. Windows are double-hung sashes, with six panes to each sash. Parts of the hoisting facilities remain. The chapel features polished cedar furnishings and joinery, mosaics, memorial plaques, stained glass windows commemorating RAN ships and personnel, and a pulpit in the shape of a ship's bow. External stairs were added when the chapel was made, and in about 1980 two spiral staircases were added to the building. A mezzanine floor has been added to the southern end. Slipways to the eastern side have gone, although bollards and mooring rings remain. The building, owing to its style and materials, contributes to the visual amenity of the nineteenth century group of buildings at Garden Island and is a waterside feature in the precinct. It is similar in scale, form and design to other buildings, such as the Factory. Hill Road residences The Hill Road Residences are a group of two brick buildings of two storeys, of the maisonette type, built in 1900 as married officer's quarters. Queen Anne style with shingled timber corner balconies and terracotta tiled roofs. Central stuccoed brick core has large batten and rough cast gable with decorative barge board. Some verandahs and balconies have been filled in. Office building The Office building is a two-storey Victorian Italianate building built to Admiralty plans, built in 1890 based on 1790 standard designs. Original section of pale brickwork with sandstone trims and clock tower surmounted by a cupola. The clock mechanism of pulleys and weights, and a differential turning all four sets of hands, is rare. The hipped roof is clad with tiles (originally slate). Windows are double-hung sashes and are arched. There is fine cedar joinery internally, a fine internal staircase, and etched entrance glass featuring Australian flora. Internal walls are rendered in ashlar imitation. Side wings added in 1920s. Hammerhead Crane The hammerhead crane prior to removal, 2013 The Hammerhead Crane consists of an asymmetric horizontal steel truss boom long, with a maximum radius of , swivelling on a square section steel truss tower square, a height of from wharf level to top of the cantilever. The main machinery house is situated on top of the boom, making the total height of the complete structure from wharf level. Foundations consist of four main concrete bases deep and below the low water level being in diameter, taken down to the rock bed. The maximum lift of the crane is when the two main purchase hooks are coupled. All crane motors and swivelling gear are electrically driven. The two main purchase hooks are each powered by motors (maximum 1,000 revolutions variation to 100 revolutions minimum) with automatically adjusting brush gear for speed control. Combined, the provide a lift of operated by one lever, a auxiliary hook powered by a motor is also part of the lifting capacity of the crane. A capacity hook for handling lifting gear and other items is also available and there is also a travelling crane in the main machine house used for maintenance purposes. When tested initially after completion, the maximum test load was lifted, lowered and controlled. Steel wire used in the mains sections totalled , apart from the of electrical gear used. The top of the tower is formed by four main girders. Approximately 250,000 rivets were used in construction. Battery Shop The Battery Shop is a single storey brick building stuccoed to represent stone. Built in 1880 to Admiralty plans of 1790 as a chain and cable store. Facades are divided up into uniform recessed bays within which are arched openings. Some are small-paned windows at the upper level as original but most of the doorways are now bricked up. Simple hipped roof now sheeted with asbestos cement. Factory The Factory is a two-storey stuccoed brick and stone building built as a factory for fitting out warships, built in 1887 based upon Admiralty plans of 1790. Doors and windows have round headed arches while the asbestos cement roof is in the form of a series of hips with ridge lights. A two-storey single gabled section to the north was devoted to making spars and masts. Naval Store Separately-listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List, the Naval Store is a large victualling store constructed in 1893 to an Admiralty design, of polychrome bricks brought from Britain. With sandstone string courses, cornices, sills, granite thresholds to doors. Of three storeys and semi-basement with parapet to the roof, the northern fourth floor never having been completed. Otherwise remains in near original condition. Floors are tallowwood, supported by cast iron columns (the ground floor is asphalt). Remaining in the building are elements of the former water-operated hydraulic hoist system, including the hoists or whips, the accumulator and there are two lifts which have been electrified. This hoist system is the most intact of its type surviving in NSW. Naval Garden The Naval Garden has been described as one of the last large garden areas on Garden Island and appears to be one of the last \\"naval style\\" gardens in Australia ‚Äì relating in spirit to the garden at Admiralty House, Kirribilli. Much nature planting survives on the northwest corner of the site including a large fig tree, a clipped olive hedge, and plantings of aspidistra, hydrangea etc. Initials carved by seamen of the Sirius in 1788* survive on sandstone formations; cannon from HMS Sirius are displayed in an appropriate naval style together with other mementos brought back by captains. The white painted galvanised iron railings, although crude and recent, are a valid naval style treatment. 20th-century sandstone terracing provides a traditional display of garden flowers and is sympathetic to the naval character of the garden. Other notable buildings * Buildings 16‚Äì20 were built as Residences in 1894‚Äì95 (three residences in one building, two in the other). The buildings have remained in use as residences throughout their life. * Building 88 was erected during 1889‚Äì91 as the Chain and Anchor Store, again designed by Barnet with Admiralty plans. By the early 1990s it was the sheet metal workshop. * Building 95 was built as the Engineers Shop 1889‚Äì91, designed by Barnet. An extension housing a foundry and other works was added in 1892. The building has retained its workshop function. * Building 99 was erected as a Spar Shed and Dining Room at the same time as Building 95 and is used as a workshop today. Other historic buildings include Buildings 21 and 22, built as Overseers' Cottages in 1885‚Äì86 and designed by Barnet. These are now the oldest extant buildings on the island and are still in residential use. Building 9 was erected as an additional Office Building in 1895‚Äì96 and retains the office function. The Boatshed (Building 25) dates from 1896 and was prefabricated in England; a slipway was built nearby. A provisions pit, excavated for the secure storage of food and supplies, dates from 1885. The Tennis Court Pavilion dates from about 1907 and, with the courts, shows that there was a recreational aspect to the island lifestyle. Also on the northern end of the island are naval gardens dating from about the 1880s. Retaining walls and sea walls were built in the 1880s and 1890s. Dating from the same period are the remains of the Goods Tramway built to transport light goods between wharves, stores and workshops. It was disused by the time of the Second World War. Dating from either 1919‚Äì20 or 1923 is the Gun Mounting Store which has retained gun functions as well as other uses. The Lime Store (Building 98, now Core Shop) was most likely built in 1927; it has been used as stables in the past. Built in about 1930 is the Signal Station (Building 13) which was used in connection with navigation of vessels on Sydney Harbour. Various wharves are in the precinct, including the Cruiser Wharf, built prior to 1912, the Oil Wharf dating from just before the Second World War and the Oil Tank just up the hill, built in 1916 when oil was starting to replace coal as fuel, the Gun Wharf (1920s), and the East Dock Wharf built at the same time as the Captain Cook Graving Dock. A tunnel system, with its own power supply, was excavated under the northern hill of the island during the Second World War and was modified in the 1960s‚Äì'70s.  Modifications and dates  *1885 ‚Äì removal of southern hummock of Garden Island. *1942 ‚Äì Captain Cook Graving Dock built and island connected to mainland.  Heritage listing  As at 30 June 2004, Garden Island Naval Precinct is of state significance for the role played by the Royal Navy and then the Royal Australian Navy in the development and growth of Sydney as an imperial and then as a global city. It has long associations with victualling and repairing naval vessels and other similar maritime defence activities. Garden Island, in particular, is significant as a place of the earliest contacts between Aboriginal people and colonists, and is important in the course of introducing and establishing European gardening and cultivation techniques and food plant species. The precinct is important in understanding the patterns of recreational use in the harbour and the development of a harbourside public domain. The precinct has important associations with historically significant people, notably king Bungaree, Governor Lachlan Macquarie, Commodore Loring, Rear Admiral Tyron, and Colonial Architect James Barnet. The precinct provides ample evidence of the technological innovations in the design and construction of machinery for the specialised needs of maintaining naval vessels. The whole precinct makes a notable contribution to the characteristic beauty of Sydney Harbour and retains a sense of being a low-lying island set against the high-rise Sydney CBD. Significant associations have long existed between the precinct and RN and RAN personnel on active service and in retirement. The precinct retains an ability to yield significant archaeological evidence, both maritime and terrestrial, on the settlement of Sydney and the development of naval facilities. The precinct is rare as the only example of a fleet base in New South Wales, and illustrates the combination of industrial, military and recreational uses that have characterised the shores and islands of Sydney Harbour since 1788. Garden Island Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 November 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Garden Island Naval Precinct is of state significance for its ability to demonstrate the importance of the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy to the development of Sydney as an imperial and later a global city. Garden Island has long been associated with maritime activities such as victualling and repairing naval vessels, and with the building and operation of harbourside defences. The precinct is significant in the course of NSW history for its role since the 1880s as the most important fleet base in Australia. The precinct is also significant as a place of the earliest contacts between Aboriginal people and colonists, with a very early armed encounter taking place on the island in 1789. The island is significant in the course of establishing European gardening techniques and methods in Australia by trial and error. The precinct, and the island in particular, are important in the patterns of recreational use of, and public campaigns for increasing public access to, Sydney Harbour as part of the public domain. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Garden Island Naval Precinct is of state significance for its associations with significant people and groups, notably with the Cadigal people for whom the island was part of their country; with king Bungaree the \\"King of Sydney\\", maritime explorer and probably first Aboriginal person to travel right around the continental coastlines, who specifically asked to die there; with Governor Macquarie who first brought the island into the public domain; with Commordore James Loring, the first commander of the Royal Navy establishment at Garden Island; with Colonial Architect James Barnet who designed many of the precinct's buildings; and with Rear Admiral Sir George Tyron, first commander in chief of the Australia station of the Royal Navy whose appointment to the Garden Island raised the status of the Australia station to that of a flag rank in 1885. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Garden Island Naval Precinct is of state significance for the technical innovation it can demonstrate in the naval machinery designed and constructed for the specialised maintenance of navy vessels; and for its contribution to the beauty and characteristic qualities of Sydney Harbour as a low, bulbous headland projecting into the blue waters of the harbour, with a collection of low scale, late Victorian naval buildings lying just above a shoreline entirely skirted by sea walls and docks, beneath the towering, skeletal frame of the Hammerhead Crane watching over it all, and edged by an ever-changing variety of naval vessels, all set against a backdrop of the late 20th century high rise of Sydney CBD forming a harbourscape of unparalleled aesthetic qualities. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Garden Island Precinct has special associations with personnel of the Royal Australian Navy who have served there, and who maintain contact with the place through the location of the headquarters of associations for former personnel. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Sydney Harbour Naval Precinct is of state significance for its ability to yield information about the earliest period of colonial settlement in Australia and as a benchmark site for the study of naval facilities on the east coast. The precinct, although subject to disturbance especially during the building of the graving dock, retains potential for maritime archaeological remains associated with the early wharf and jetty facilities, and depositional material from the shore and fleet units. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Sydney Harbour Naval Precinct is rare at the state level as the only example in New South Wales of a Royal Australian Navy Fleet Base, and as a naval facility that has been in almost continual use for defence purposes since 1788. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Sydney Harbour Naval Precinct is representative of the ways in which the islands and headlands of Sydney Harbour have been used for industrial and military purposes during the late colonial and 20th century periods, and is illustrative of the debates about recreational use of the harbour's isles and foreshores during the early colonial and later 20th century periods.

Accession  He was the second son of Zayed I to rule Abu Dhabi and acceded on his elder brother Tahnoun's peaceful death. Zayed's eldest son, Khalifa, did not want to rule and so Hamdan, actually Zayed's fifth son (the fourth, Saqr, was to rule following the death of Hamdan's younger brother and successor, Sultan) took up the reins. His rule was unpopular within the ruling family as he discontinued the subsidies normally paid to family members. He was also said to have disrupted Abu Dhabi's trade relations. While Abu Dhabi's population was violently anti-Wahhabi (a number of incursions into Buraimi had helped to seal Wahhabi unpopularity), Hamdan sent a mission to Ibn Saud in Riyadh. Hamdan oversaw the continuation of the breakdown of authority which had followed his powerful father's long reign and death. In Liwa and Buraimi, fighting broke out between the Bedouin tribes, with the Manasir and Bani Yas fighting a southern confederation of Awamir, Duru and Al Bu Shamis. An ally of the Wahhabis, Hamdan managed to broker an uneasy truce. In August 1922, Hamdan was killed by his younger brother, Sultan. Zayed's other two sons disagreed with the murder and were estranged, the town of Abu Dhabi becoming disorderly as factions emerged in the confusion following the murder. Later Hamdan‚Äôs brother avenged the murder of his brother and killed Sultan, later becoming the Ruler of Abu Dhabi. Sultan inherited the unstable interior that Hamdan had barely pacified, pitching him into a series of wars and outbreaks of peace which dogged his rule.  Sheikha Latifa  Hamdan's daughter, Latifa, fled to Dubai on his murder and later married Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum. She was the mother of the current ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

Family His father was Augustin-Antoine de Ferriol (1653-1736 or 1737), comte d'Argental, pr√©sident √† mortier of the parlement of Metz and brother of Charles de Ferriol d'Argental, French ambassador to the Sublime Porte. His mother was Marie-Ang√©lique de Tencin, sister of cardinal Pierre Gu√©rin de Tencin and Claudine Gu√©rin de Tencin, mother of d'Alembert. His brother was the dramatic writer :fr:Antoine de Ferriol de Pont-de-Veyle. In 1737 he married Jeanne-Gr√¢ce Bosc du Bouchet (d.1774). He was nicknamed 'goussaut' ('sturdy horse') within his family.Pittet Jo√´l, Lettres priv√©es de Mme de Tencin et du futur cardinal de Tencin √† leur fr√®re le pr√©sident de Tencin et autres, Imp. Saint-Paul, Fribourg, 2010, p.97 : lettre de Pierre de Tencin √† D'Argental du 22 juillet 1742. On the death of his aunt in 1760, he inherited the title baron Saint-Martin-de-R√©. Career D'Argental passed his bar exams in 1719 and became an advocate in the Parlement of Paris in 1721. He was offered the post of intendant of Saint-Domingue in 1738, but turned it down; he did however accept the post of Minister Plenipotentiary to France of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza from 1759 to 1788. During the disputes between Louis XV and the Parlement in the 1750s, he was more inclined to the side of the Crown than of those seeking greater independence for the Parlement. Friendship with Voltaire Like Voltaire, d'Argental was educated at Louis- le-Grand, though as he was six years younger, it is not certain that they knew each other at school. Like Voltaire he was devoted to the theatre. Voltaire's first letter to him was written in 1724 and after this they corresponded frequently - more than 1,200 from Voltaire to d'Argental have survived, though d'Argental wrote much less often, and never visited Voltaire in Ferney. From 1737, supported by his wife, he became Voltaire‚Äôs literary critical friend, as well as his theatre agent and even his stage director. While Voltaire was exiled in Ferney it was the d‚ÄôArgentals who did what was necessary to bring his plays to the stage, securing the venues, contracting the actors, and working with them intensively to ensure that Voltaire‚Äôs meaning was properly communicated. As well as helping Voltaire in theatrical matters, d‚ÄôArgental was his indispensable organiser in the campaigns against injustice in the 1760s - the Calas, de la Barre and Sirven Affairs. His close connections with the court and in particular with the Foreign Minister Choiseul were especially useful in these cases. In 1760, when funds were being raised to pay for a statue of Voltaire by Pigalle, he did not have enough money to make a contribution, so he borrowed 10,000 livres from Voltaire himself. From the time Voltaire returned from exile to Paris in February 1788 until his death in May, d‚ÄôArgental was with him constantly. Relationship with Adrienne Lecouvreur As a young man he developed an infatuation for the famous actress Adrienne Lecouvreur. His mother was afraid that he would marry her, and threatened to send him to the colonies to prevent this. The actress wrote to her in 1721 promising to spurn his advances, and urging her not to exile a son so able and so full of promise. D'Argental knew nothing of this correspondence until, sixty-three years later, he was going through his mother's papers at the age of eighty-five. As was normal at the time for actors, Lecouvreur was denied a proper Christian burial when she died and her body was disposed of in unconsecrated ground. In 1786, fifty-six years after her death, d'Argental managed to located her burial place at what is new 115 rue de la Grenelle in Paris. He placed there a marble tablet with a poem to her that he had written. Work It is believed by some scholars that d'Argenson was the true author of the :fr:M√©moires du comte de Comminge (1735) which was published by his aunt, Mme de Tencin. However Voltaire confirmed that d'Argenson himself never claimed to have been the author. Death D'Argental died in 1788 after contracting a fever, which lasted only a few days.

The main suspect, Francis Auld, was tried for murder in the High Court of Justiciary in Glasgow and was acquitted when the jury returned a majority verdict of \\"not proven\\". A bid by prosecutors to try Auld for a second time on the basis of new evidence was rejected by the courts in 2016. Auld died of cancer in July 2017. The outcome of Auld's trial prompted a national conversation around the continued existence of the \\"not proven\\" verdict and around double jeopardy rules.  Murder  Duffy, a 19-year-old student at Motherwell College, went missing in the early hours of the morning of Saturday 30 May 1992 after a night out with friends, celebrating the fact she had been called to audition at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Her body was found by passers-by that evening in an area of waste ground near a car park at Miller Street, Hamilton, South Lanarkshire. Duffy was found \\"lying on her back, naked from the waist down, with her face and head covered in blood\\" and branches and twigs \\"had been inserted into her mouth, nostrils and vagina\\". According to a post mortem examination, she had died between 1.30 am and 1.30 pm, having suffered extensive blunt force injuries to the head and neck, as well as asphyxia and injuries to the anus and rectum.  Trial  20-year-old Francis Auld was tried for Duffy's murder in 1992. Witnesses had seen Auld with Duffy between midnight and 1 am. A bite to Duffy's right breast, which would have been \\"excruciatingly painful\\" and was inflicted within an hour prior to death, matched Auld's dental features. However, Auld said that he had left Duffy in the company of someone named \\"Mark\\", who was never identified. The jury returned a majority verdict of \\"not proven\\" in November 1992.  Aftermath   Threatening phone calls  In 1994, Auld was convicted of making threatening phone calls to two former friends, and sentenced to 240 hours community service. He admitted telling one of them \\"Patrick, you thought Amanda was the last. Well, you're next, after Caroline.\\"  Civil action  In 1995, Duffy's parents, Joe and Kathleen, sued Auld in civil court, where the standard of evidence is lower. Auld did not contest the lawsuit and the couple were awarded a ¬£50,000 payout. This amount was never paid.  Calls to scrap \\"not proven\\" verdict  Following the verdict in the criminal trial, Duffy's parents launched a high-profile campaign for the \\"not proven\\" verdict to be abolished in Scots law. A national petition was launched at an event in Glasgow addressed by Joe Duffy. In 1993, the couple's Member of Parliament, George Robertson, launched the Criminal Procedure (Abolition Of Not Proven Verdict) (Scotland) Bill in the House of Commons to scrap the verdict, though its likelihood of success was considered slim. The Duffys' campaign also increased pressure on the Scottish Office, which eventually launched a consultation on scrapping the \\"not proven\\" verdict in 1994. MP John Home Robertson, in a 1995 bid to scrap the verdict, praised \\"Kathleen and Joe Duffy for the thoughtful and constructive campaign that they have been waging\\". When the Scottish Parliament debated scrapping the verdict in 2016, the Duffy case was cited by MSP Michael McMahon in support of scrapping the verdict.  Bid for retrial  After the introduction of the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011, which allows for a person to be tried twice for the same crime in certain circumstances, Strathclyde Police reopened an investigation into Duffy's murder in 2012 because they believed that \\"certain people have information in relation to Amanda's murder that they are withholding, perhaps from a sense of misguided loyalty\\". Police Scotland's cold case unit later re- examined the crime on the instruction of the Crown Office. In 2015, prosecutors launched a bid under the Act to re-try Auld for the murder. However, the bid was rejected by judges in February 2016. Jim Govan, the chief forensic scientist at the original trial, then went on public record, saying the jury got the verdict wrong and there was more than enough evidence to convict.Lynn McPherson, The jury got it wrong: Amanda Duffy murder scene investigators break silence on not proven case, Daily Record, 28 February, 2016 Auld died of cancer in July 2017.

January 1968) known professionally as Kevin Bendix is a Danish serial entrepreneur specializing in development of temporary urban culture.  Early life  Bendix grew up in the South Harbour district of Copenhagen, which in the 1970s and 1980s gained a reputation for being the area in Denmark with most people on social welfare, the lowest education rate and life expectancy and high incidence of all major social problems. With a father from Jamaica and a Danish mother, and thefore a darker skin than the majority of Danes, Bendix had to face racism and bullying during his school years, which Bendix claims to have helped him become an indefatigable entrepreneur.  Professional career  In the late 1990s to early 2000s Bendix moved away from working as a television producer in the Danish Broadcasting Corporation to become CEO in an independent TV production company 'Engine' which specialized in creating educational entertainment targeting young people and aiming for having a more serious layout with fewer jump cuts slower pace and more information, than the standard of danish youth television at the time.  Darling aRTbar  Bendix ran Caf√© Darling, later known as Darling aRTbar from April 2004 to September 2013, before that, the venue was previously known as Basse and Ohnas Kaffe & Cocktail. The bar was located on Enghave Plads and together with the other local shops suffered from asphyxiation from the building of the Copenhagen Metro City ring. As an Art bar Bendix let artists use the bar as an exhibition hall for free if they chose to donate an art-piece to the art collection. During the art bars existence it featured numerous concerts and poetry readings from the Danish beat poet Claus H√∏xbroe, Dansk Fl√∏de among others.  Restaurants Haven Bendix got interested in developing the vacant factory grounds left by the Carlsberg Brewery (today known as the Carlsberg district) in 2010. after the financial crisis of 2008 the area had seen little development. Bendix overtook the lease of the brewery's old leisure Center called 'Haven' (The Garden) and transformed it into an cafe / restaurant with a distinct Danish 1970s dive bar look featuring old styled brown curtains and red checkered tablecloth. Though successful, Haven closed on January 2014 as the temporary lease could not be extended. Vildt & Vin Vildt & Vin (translated Wild and Wine) opened in July 2015 was located on Enghavevej 14, as its name applied it served wild meat like venison and zebra.  √òl & K√∏d  √òl & K√∏d (translated Beer and Beef) is a pop-up bar originally located in the Carlsberg district. Whereas Vildt & Vin was a true restaurant, √òl & K√∏d was outdoor only featuring grilled exotic meat . BOXLAND In 2013 Bendix joined a collaboration with Carlsberg Byen and formed Boxland Bazaer, a flea market featuring pop-up cafes, urban farming and food court. The BOXLAND Bazar at Carlsberg was the first version of a concept featuring temporary container 'buildings' erected as a village with each container featuring different functions. the concept 'village' has since moved to the former produce market 'Gr√∏nttorvet' in Valby  References  Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Danish businesspeople ","title":"Kevin Bendix"},{"id":"58907815","text":"Adolf Gondrell (1902‚Äì1954) was a German stage and film actor known for his comedy roles.

The lakes are of particular interest because they receive the water outlets from two power stations and the temperature of the water is significantly raised, supporting a different flora and fauna to other lakes in the region. Water for the two power stations is drawn primarily from Lake PƒÖtnowskie, and discharged via canals to Lake Liche≈Ñskie, with other outlets flowing into the other lakes.

Lake Liche≈Ñskie is shallow and shows the greatest temperature variation, reaching a maximum of in mid summer while the deeper Lake ≈ölesi≈Ñskie reached . Flora and fauna In the mid 1990s, eel grass (Vallisneria spiralis), a non-native species, made its appearance in three of the lakes and a decade later was present in the littoral regions of four lakes, growing so vigorously as to exclude other vegetation in many shallow parts. The changes in temperature and in vegetation altered the balance of micro-organisms present, new rotifer species appeared and competed with existing species, native populations often having little defence and being crowded out. Larger organisms also appeared; non-native species now living and breeding in the lakes include three species of bryozoan, three crustaceans, seven molluscs and at least six species of fish. The hotter water encourages eutrophication and alters the proportions of fish species present; common bream and white bream are able to thrive while populations of predatory fish diminish. When the discharges from the power station into Lakes Liche≈Ñskie, ≈ölesi≈Ñskie and Mikorzy≈Ñskie cease in the autumn, common roach numbers diminish from 28‚Äì56% of the total fish stock in June to 1‚Äì2% in October. It is probable that the roaches migrate to the warmer lakes nearer the power stations in autumn.

Sarrazin argued that if immigration continued, Germany would, over time, become a predominantly Muslim country.

Its name comes from Woburn Abbey, the main country seat of the Dukes of Bedford, who developed much of Bloomsbury. The street is well-preserved, including the black painted bow-fronted shops windows. Several of the buildings are Grade II* listed (No. 1-9 and 9a, Woburn Walk). The walk shares the same building design with the adjacent Duke's Road, which however was built open to traffic. As of today a number of shops, restaurants and a cafeteria are located on both sides of the walk. Notable residents From 1895 to 1919, the Irish poet, dramatist and Nobel Prize winner W. B. Yeats lived at what is today 5 Woburn Walk. From 1905 to 1906, the novelist Dorothy Richardson lived in Woburn Walk, in the building number 6, opposite where Yeats stayed.

Founded in Oslo (then Christiania) by Dorothea Christensen in 1898, it was also the first organization for housewives in Europe. The association functioned until the late.1970s. In 1897, Christensen had published an article in Husmoderen (The Housewife) titled \\"Vi husm√∏dre slutter os sammen\\" (We housewives should stick together) which paved the way for the establishment of Hjemmenes Vel on 10 March 1898. Based on the success of the Oslo organization, local Hjemmenes Vel branches were established throughout the country. As a result, in 1915 Hjemmenes Vels Landsforbund or national headquarters was founded by Marie Michelet who chaired it until 1934. By 1924, there were some 50 local organizations in Norway. From the start, Hjemmenes Vels Landsforbund was associated with the Norwegian National Women's Council. In 1933, the organization changed its name to Norges Husmorforbund or Norwegian Housewives' Association. It became a large, influential organization with 30,000 members by 1940, providing advice on nutrition, housekeeping, childcare and economics. Husmorbladet (Housewives Magazine) was published from 1952. The association was particularly successful in the years up to 1960 when there were 70,000 members. Thereafter, as women began to take up employment, interest in the organization gradually faded until it was no longer viable.

Like most positional games, it is described by its set of positions (X) and its family of winning-sets (\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\- a family of subsets of X). It is played by two players, called First and Second, who alternately take previously-untaken positions. In a strong positional game, the winner is the first player who holds all the elements of a winning-set. If all positions are taken and no player wins, then it is a draw. Classic Tic- tac-toe is an example of a strong positional game.  First player advantage  In a strong positional game, Second cannot have a winning strategy. This can be proved by a strategy-stealing argument: if Second had a winning strategy, then First could have stolen it and win too, but this is impossible since there is only one winner. Therefore, for every strong-positional game there are only two options: either First has a winning strategy, or Second has a drawing strategy. An interesting corollary is that, if a certain game does not have draw positions, then First always has a winning strategy.  Comparison to Maker-Breaker game  Every strong positional game has a variant that is a Maker-Breaker game. In that variant, only the first player (\\"Maker\\") can win by holding a winning-set. The second player (\\"Breaker\\") can win only by preventing Maker to hold a winning-set. For fixed X and \\\\mathcal{F}, the strong-positional variant is strictly harder for the first player, since in it, he needs to both \\"attack\\" (try to get a winning-set) and \\"defend\\" (prevent the second player from getting one), while in the maker-breaker variant, the first player can focus only on \\"attack\\". Hence, every winning-strategy of First in a strong-positional game is also a winning-strategy of Maker in the corresponding maker-breaker game. The opposite is not true. For example, in the maker-breaker variant of Tic-Tac-Toe, Maker has a winning strategy, but in its strong-positional (classic) variant, Second has a drawing strategy. Similarly, the strong-positional variant is strictly easier for the second player: every winning strategy of Breaker in a maker-breaker game is also a drawing-strategy of Second in the corresponding strong-positional game, but the opposite is not true.  The extra-set paradox  Suppose First has a winning strategy. Now, we add a new set to \\\\mathcal{F}. Contrary to intuition, it is possible that this new set will now destroy the winning strategy and make the game a draw. Intuitively, the reason is that First might have to spend some moves to prevent Second from owning this extra set. The extra-set paradox does not appear in Maker-Breaker games.  Examples   The clique game  The clique game is an example of a strong positional game. It is parametrized by two integers, n and N. In it: * Xcontains all edges of the complete graph on {1,...,N}; * \\\\mathcal{F}contains all cliques of size n. According to Ramsey's theorem, there exists some number R(n,n) such that, for every N > R(n,n), in every two-coloring of the complete graph on {1,...,N}, one of the colors must contain a clique of size n. Therefore, by the above corollary, when N > R(n,n), First always has a winning strategy.  Multi- dimensional tic-tac-toe  Consider the game of tic-tac-toe played in an d-dimensional cube of length n. By the Hales‚ÄìJewett theorem, when d is large enough (as a function of n), every 2-coloring of the cube-cells contains a monochromatic geometric line. Therefore, by the above corollary, First always has a winning strategy.  Open questions  Besides these existential results, there are few constructive results related to strong-positional games. For example, while it is known that the first player has a winning strategy in a sufficiently large clique game, no specific winning strategy is currently known.

It was designed and partly made by Ernst Rietschel, and unveiled on 25 June 1868. The monument consists of a group of bronze statues on stone plinths centred on a statue of Luther, surrounded by statues of related individuals and allegorical statues representing related towns. The elements are arranged in the shape of a castle, recalling Luther's hymn \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (\\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\\"). It is one of the largest Luther Monuments, and shaped views of the reformer. Copies of the central Luther statue are located in Europe and the United States, including the Luther Monument in Washington, D.C. (1884).  History  The monument on a 1902 postcard Plans to build a significant monument to Martin Luther in Worms were already made in the 18th century. In 1856, an association, the Luther-Denkmal- Verein, was formed, which pursued the idea and collected donations from Europe and the Americas. Among the historical topics remembered by the monument are Luther's Ninety-five Theses of 1517 and his appearance at the Diet of Worms in 1521, where he defended his theses facing Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The main high bronze statue of Luther is surrounded by eleven others depicting other reformers, political figures, and personified related towns. The statues are mounted on separate stone plinths on a stepped base, and the overall shape of the monument is intended to resemble a castle, representing Luther's hymn \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (A firm castle is our God). Ernst Rietschel designed the group in 1859. He completed the sculptures of Luther and John Wycliff but died in 1861. The other statues were mostly executed by his pupils. Adolf von Donndorf contributed standing figures of Reuchlin and Frederick the Wise of Saxony, seated figures of Girolamo Savonarola, Peter Waldo and an allegorical statue (with mural crown) representing the town of Magdeburg grieving after the Sack of Magdeburg in 1631, as well as reliefs. Johannes Schilling created a statue for the town of Speyer, the location of the Protestation at Speyer in 1539. made statues of Jan Hus, Philipp Melanchthon, Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, and one for the town of Augsburg, where the Augsburg Confession was first presented in 1530. The architect Georg Hermann Nicolai, a pupil of Gottfried Semper, was also involved. The monument was cast at the . Luther is depicted in the robe of preacher, not the habit and cowl of a monk. He is holding a Bible in his left hand, and rests his right fist upon the book. According to Hans A. Pohlsander, \\"his posture suggests courage and determination\\". In addition to the main statues, the monument has inscriptions with quotations, scenes from Luther's life, coats of arms of 27 Protestant towns, and bronze relief sculptures depicting two Electors of Saxony, with others including Justus Jonas, Johann Bugenhagen, Johannes Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli.

Rietschel's statue of Luther became a typical image of the reformer in the late 19th century and became a model for many monuments to him, with copies in Europe and the United States, such as the Luther Monument in Washington, D.C. (1884), and others at the Concordia Lutheran Seminary in St. Louis (1903), in Decorah, Iowa (1911), Saint Paul, Minnesota (1921), Dubuque, Iowa (1923), and Detroit (1930). The 150th anniversary of the monument was celebrated as a major event in 2018.

Life Theophilus Dunn was born at the end of the 18th century and lived for many years in Netherton, near Dudley. He achieved some fame as a fortune teller and finder of lost objects, and as someone who could cast healing spells. He supposedly was fairly well educated and could \\"cast a horoscope with as much facility almost as a Nostradamus\\". A number of stories are told of his prophesies such as warning the prizefighter, William Perry of his forthcoming defeat at the hands of Tom Sayers. He was known by some as the \\"Dudley Devil\\". An obituary in a local paper claimed that \\"he was the chief resource in times of difficulty or trial to half the lower classes of society in the district in which he resided\\". It was also stated that he was the \\"restorer of lost goods, the discoverer of stolen property, the healer of broken hearts\\" and that \\"apparently respectable persons\\" had travelled fifty to sixty miles for consultations with Dunn. Reputedly, he sold charms to cure toothache, priced at 1 shilling, consisting of a supposed dialogue between Jesus and St Peter, written on a piece of paper, in which the apostle is cured of his painful teeth by faith. He was found dead at his home on 9 October 1851, apparently after taking his own life, the official verdict of the subsequent inquest being \\"Insanity\\". His death was reported in many British newspapers, some published as far away from his home region as John o'Groats, Scotland. Theophilus Dunn's grave is in the churchyard of St Andrews', Netherton.

It was designed by J. Kirkpatrick and built from 1900. The property is owned by the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The area occupied by the stands were previously Aboriginal land, a water reserve, community facility, showground, and cricket ground.  History  In 1811 Governor Macquarie proclaimed Sydney's second Common, an area of .Wentworth Courier, 2014, 22 The establishment of the Sydney Cricket Ground dates from 1854 when matches were played there by members of the military from Victoria Barracks. From 1876 all major cricket matches were played at these grounds. The earliest grandstands date from around the turn of the century when four grandstands were constructed. Of these, only the Members Stand and the Lady Members Stand survive. The Members Stand is a large two level grandstand built and designed by architect, J. Kirkpatrick. The stand incorporates an earlier three storey stuccoed brick club room at the rear.Heritage Branch Report, 1984 The original Members' Stand was built in 1878 in the north west corner where the current Members' Stand now sits. The Members' Stand was rebuilt on its current site at a cost of . From 1920 to 1937, the dominant visual elements of the (adjacent) Sydney Showground complex by this time were the peripheral walls. The iconic Members' Stand clock tower and tower of the Anthony Hordern Building. In 1896 the Lady Members' Stand was opened, along with a concrete cycling track which circled the inside of the ground. Like the Members' Stand, the Lady Members' Stand, commonly called the Ladies' Stand, is an elegant two level grandstand constructed of cast iron and with an extensive three-storey members' room at the rear. The (adjacent) Sydney Showground was the venue for the first Ashes Test held on Australian soil. It was also used for World Series Cricket matches during the late 1970s when the Sydney Cricket Ground was unavailable.  Description  Timber and cast iron grandstands.

She was born in Portland, Maine and studied at the University of Wisconsin and at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, Oxford. She moved to the United Kingdom from the United States in the 1960s to study in Oxford for a year, and married her husband Nick Fisher in 1967. After completing postgraduate studies in the United States, they both returned to the United Kingdom in 1970, moving to Glasgow in 1971 and Aberdeen in 1976. Fisher has worked at both Glasgow Print Studio and Peacock Visual Arts (formerly Peacock Printmakers) in Aberdeen, and helped to establish both workshops. She was a founder member of Glasgow Print Studio in 1972, and was responsible for co-running the workshop for the first few years, with Sheena McGregor.  Teaching  Fisher taught at several Scottish art schools before her retirement in 2004: Glasgow School of Art, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, Dundee and Grays School of Art, Aberdeen. She also lectured at Oxford Polytechnic (now Oxford Brookes University) in the early 1970s.  Artistic career  Depictions of self and family have been central to the artist's work, examining domestic and personal issues through a feminist perspective with honesty. She often uses herself and her family as models. Art history has been an influence on her work, as has religious iconography, and drawing has been a central part of her artistic practice. The Canopy Series (1987) draws on experiences from the artist's own family. It was first exhibited in Glasgow at the Third Eye Centre, and later in Aberdeen, Dundee, at the 10th International Bradford Biennale, Plymouth, Cardiff and Orkney. Fisher's Vigil I series (1999‚Äì2000) is a suite of prints made using the same four plates, inked differently with their sequence of printing and overprinting altered each time to produce unique prints. The theme is the artist's husband's cardiac disease, both the tests, treatments and medical procedures he underwent as well as Fisher's fears as his wife and carer. The Vigil II series takes Fisher's daughter's battle with breast cancer as the subject. A significant exhibition of Fisher's work was Grisaille Legacy in 2010. The show began at the Royal Scottish Academy in January 2010 and subsequently toured to Space Gallery, University of Portsmouth and New Hall Art Collection, Cambridge. It consisted of monumental scale figurative drawings, inspired by classical works but using the artist's personal and family life as the subject. The powerful, large-scale drawings include images of long-term mental illness, physical decline and aging, and the effects of a cancer diagnosis in the family. The series was begun during a drawing project funded by the Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC) in 200-2001 and completed after Fisher's retirement in 2004.

The 292nd overall episode of the series, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 31, 2018. The episode, which focuses on Mr. Mackey and Kenny McCormick, parodies the popularity of scooter-sharing systems and e-scooters, which cause a candy shortage on Halloween, and a hoarding problem for the citizens of South Park. The episode's title is a parody of the classic horror-thriller film The Birds, elements of which are referenced in the episode. The episode also includes Halloween costumes and plot elements inspired by the video game Fortnite. Plot A narrator opens the episode by explaining that the Halloween night depicted in the story was different from the ones that came before, and changed everyone‚Äôs lives forever. While putting his garbage out on the sidewalk, South Park Elementary School counselor Mr. Mackey trips over an e-scooter, one of many ride share scooters left anonymously all over town. Despite their popularity, Mackey is skeptical of the trend and hopes it is only a fad, a position that escalates to anger after the vehicular collisions he experiences at the hands of scooter users. That night, he collects all the abandoned e-scooters he can find in a pickup truck and throws them off a cliff. He nonetheless finds the town filled with them the next day, even inexplicably in his home. Fourth graders Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman decide to use the e-scooters to go trick-or-treating, but because using an e-scooter requires a cell phone, this excludes their impoverished friend, Kenny McCormick, who does not own a cell phone. Kenny learns that all of his other schoolmates are using e-scooters on Halloween too, leaving him alone on the holiday. At a town meeting the day before Halloween, the police inform the public that the use of e-scooters, which allows riders to cover more ground in a single night, means that citizens will be visited by trick- or-treaters from surrounding towns, and will need at least $6,000 of candy to prepare for this. This leads to a panic by some of the townsfolk, and a shortage of candy. Mackey is among those worried about Halloween night, but when a despondent Kenny tries to seek his counsel, and Mackey learns from him that cell phones are needed to use e-scooters, they join forces to resolve both of their problems. On Halloween night, citizens and the police are swamped with trick-or-treaters using e-scooters, a problem that occurs nationwide as even dense urban areas like New York City are reported to be out of candy. Mackey and Kenny drive to a cell tower and disable it. This in turn disables all of the trick-or-treaters‚Äô cell phones and e-scooters, which they abandon upon returning to trick-or-treating on foot. As the narrator, revealed to be Kenny, relates that this was the last, good Halloween that felt like Halloween, one of the abandoned e-scooters stands up by itself and drives off without a rider. Reception Jesse Schedeen with IGN rated the episode a 7.8 out of 10 and summarized in his review, \\"While not the best Halloween-themed South Park episode, 'The Scoots' certainly has its moments. The e-scooter storyline is a bit repetitive at first but eventually has great payoff after a candy-fueled apocalypse sweeps over South Park.\\" John Hugar, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode an A- grade, stating in his review, \\"So, why does 'The Scoots' still manage to work so well? Because it focuses on comedy and characterization more than message. Yes, this episode wants to make a point about the degree to which our phones control our lives, but it mostly just wants to tell a story about a kid being left out on Halloween, and a counselor being tortured by seemingly magic scooters.\\" Chris Longo with Den of Geek rated the episode 3 out of 5 stars and stated in his review, \\"South Park could have gotten bogged down in the mystery of the scooters or wandered down a path of addressing our smartphone fixation, but it really said all it needed to about e-scooters by using Mr. Mackey, who gets his car dinged a number of times, to illustrate the potential pitfalls of scootin'.\\" Longo also told how he had seen e-scooters become an issue at the San Diego Comic-Con and was able to relate better to the episode as a result of it.

She is known for her work on meiosis in human egg cells, and for her studies on the mechanisms that lead to Down syndrome. Early life and education  Schuh was born in 1980 in Germany and grew up in Bad Pyrmont. She received a diploma degree in biochemistry from the University of Bayreuth, Germany. She went on to do her PhD with Jan Ellenberg at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany, where she used live cell imaging to study the organization of the spindle in mouse oocytes.  Career  In 2009, Schuh became a group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. Her work centers around the process of asymmetric oocyte division, in which oocytes mature into eggs by extruding half of their chromosomes in a small cell termed the polar body. This requires the spindle apparatus in these cells to be asymmetric. She discovered a role for proteins that control actin nucleation in the positioning of the spindle. In studying how actin helps position the spindle, she discovered that vesicles carrying specific signals can change the organization and density of actin networks. Errors in oocyte division can lead to genetic disorders such as Down syndrome. Working with Bourn Hall Clinic, the clinic that first pioneered IVF, Schuh studied human oocyte divisions directly, instead of using mouse oocytes as a model system. She found that human oocytes have a surprisingly slow and error-prone mechanism for assembling the meiotic spindle, increasing the likelihood of segregation errors. She has also investigated the reasons why the children of older mothers have a higher rate of pregnancy loss and Down syndrome, finding that oocytes from older mothers have a higher frequency of errors in pairing between sister chromatids. Schuh has shown that actin filaments normally protect mammalian eggs against this type of error.

The film follows the Chicago Seven, a group of anti‚ÄìVietnam War protesters charged with conspiracy and crossing state lines with the intention of inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It features an ensemble cast that includes Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Sacha Baron Cohen, Daniel Flaherty, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, John Carroll Lynch, Eddie Redmayne, Noah Robbins, Mark Rylance, Alex Sharp, and Jeremy Strong. Sorkin originally wrote the screenplay in 2007, with the intent of Steven Spielberg directing the film with mostly unknown actors. After the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike and budget concerns forced Spielberg to drop out as director, Sorkin was announced as director in October 2018, and much of the cast joined that same month. Filming took place in the fall of 2019 in Chicago and around New Jersey. Originally planned for a theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, the distribution rights to the film were sold to Netflix due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released in select theaters on September 25, 2020, and began streaming digitally on Netflix on October 16, 2020. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, the screenplay, and the modern parallels to the 1960s. Plot In August 1968, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger, Lee Weiner, John Froines, and Bobby Seale ‚Äì begin prepare to protest at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Five months later, all eight of them are arrested and are charged with trying to incite a riot. John N. Mitchell, the Attorney General appoints Tom Foran and Richard Schultz as the prosecutors, while all the defendants except Seale are represented by William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass. Judge Julius Hoffman shows significant prejudice for the prosecution. Seale's attorney is not present and he receives help from Fred Hampton. Abbie Hoffman openly antagonizes the court. Judge Hoffman begins removing jurors who are suspected of sympathizing with the defendants because of reported threats from the Black Panther Party and gives the defendants and their attorneys multiple contempt of court charges. Numerous undercover cops testify. One night, Hayden noticed two cops tailing Davis and attempted to let the air out of their tire, but was caught and later arrested. Abbie led a protest to the police station where Hayden was being kept, but turned around upon seeing the police blockade outside. When attempting to return to the park, police had taken control of the hill. A riot ensued, and the protestors claimed the hill again. Kunstler makes a point that none of the defendants instigated the riot. It is reported that Hampton is killed during a police raid. In retaliation to Seale continuing to speak up for his constitutional rights, Judge Hoffman has him taken to another room, beaten, and returned gagged and chained. Judge Hoffman takes Schultz‚Äôs suggestion of declaring Seale's case a mistrial. Kunstler and Weinglass decide to put Ramsey Clark, the previous Attorney General on the stand. Judge Hoffman refuses to let the jury hear his testimony, despite Clark testifying that the police instigated the riots. This prompts Dellinger to punch a bailiff, resulting in his arrest. Kunstler presents a tape implicating Hayden to the defendants. On the night of the riot, Davis tried to pacify cops attempting to arrest a protestor who was climbing a pole. After the police clubbed Davis‚Äô head, an enraged Hayden told the protestors that if blood were to be spilled, let it spill everywhere. The defendants were eventually cornered by police, who removed their badges and proceeded to assault them. Abbie deduces that Hayden was taken out of context, and Hayden asks him to testify. Abbie says that Hayden was misconstrued. Hayden uses the closing statement by naming over 4,000 soldiers that died in the Vietnam War since the trial began.

Executive producers Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald collaborated on the development of Sorkin's script, with Spielberg intending to direct the film. Sacha Baron Cohen was cast as Abbie Hoffman as early as 2007, while, at the time, Spielberg approached Will Smith for the role of Bobby Seale, and planned to meet with Heath Ledger about playing Tom Hayden. The Writers Guild of America strike, which started in November 2007 and lasted 100 days, Paul Greengrass in Talks for Aaron Sorkin- Penned 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' , Rebecca Ford, The Hollywood Reporter, 23 July 2013.Retrieved: April 26, 2015. delayed filming and the project was suspended. Sorkin was later to continue to rewrite the script for Spielberg, and the director intended to mostly cast unknowns to keep the budget down. In 2008, Ben Stiller was reported to be working with Sorkin while considering directing the film. In July 2013, it was announced that Paul Greengrass would direct the film,https://deadline.com/2013/07/paul-greengrass-in-final-talks- to-direct-aaron-sorkins-chicago-7-script-for-dreamworks-546608/ but he exited the project two months later when a budget could not be agreed upon,https://variety.com/2013/film/news/paul-greengrass-parts-ways-with- dreamworks-chicago-7-exclusive-1200615093/ and it did not move forward. In July 2020, Vanity Fair reported that Spielberg had decided to resurrect The Trial of the Chicago 7 \\"a year and a half ago.\\" In October 2018, Sorkin was announced as the director of the film. In December 2018, the film was put on hold due to budgetary concerns, until it was revived and ready for distribution offers. Paramount Pictures ended up picking up distribution rights. Casting In October 2018, Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne joined the cast. In November 2018, Jonathan Majors joined the cast. In February 2019, Seth Rogen, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Alex Sharp joined the cast. Michael Keaton was also being considered for a role. In August, Frank Langella and Mark Rylance were added to the cast. In September, Jeremy Strong was cast, replacing Rogen. In October, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II joined the cast to replace Majors, with Kelvin Harrison Jr., Keaton, William Hurt, J. C. MacKenzie, Max Adler and Ben Shenkman joining the cast. Filming Principal production was set to begin in September 2019, but began the next month in October between Chicago and New Jersey. Filming in Morris County, New Jersey took place in Hennessy Hall, affectionately known as \\"The Mansion,\\" on Fairleigh Dickinson University's Florham Campus and Hyland Hall (located within Henderson Hall), Grant Park in Chicago, in Hudson County, New Jersey in Hoboken, and at Santa Maria at College of Saint Elizabeth. The film had a production budget of $35 million, with $11 million going towards the cast.  Music  The score was written by British composer Daniel Pemberton, who also wrote the score for Aaron Sorkin's 2017 film Molly's Game. The soundtrack, titled The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (Music From The Netflix Film), was released digitally under American record label Var√®se Sarabande and Universal Music Group on October 16, 2020. The soundtrack features three original songs performed by British singer Celeste, including \\"Hear My Voice\\", which served as the lead single and was released on October 8, 2020. The song was also submitted to the 93rd Academy Awards for Best Original Song in September 2020. \\"Blood on the Streets\\" was released as a promotional single on October 15, 2020, a day before the release of both the soundtrack and film. A physical CD edition of the soundtrack will be released on 20 November 2020. Recording of the soundtrack took place in Studio Two at Abbey Road Studios and was conducted by Sam Okell, with assistance from Christopher Parker and Jack Thomason. Release The Trial of the Chicago 7 was originally scheduled by Paramount Pictures to begin a limited theatrical release on September 25, 2020, before going wide on October 16, 2020. On June 20, 2020, due to the movie theater closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, it was reported Netflix was in negotiations to acquire rights to the film. On July 1, 2020, the company officially closed a $56 million deal to distribute the film. It was released in select theaters on September 25, 2020 (ironically Paramount's original release date), and was made available digitally on Netflix on October 16. Although Netflix does not publicly release the box office results of its films, Deadline Hollywood reported that the film averaged about 10 people per show at the 100 theaters it was playing in its opening weekend. Upon its digital release, it was the second-most streamed film over its debut weekend, which IndieWire called \\"higher than usual for a more-serious entry Netflix title\\". Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 7.93/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"An actors' showcase enlivened by its topical fact-based story, The Trial of the Chicago 7 plays squarely ‚Äì and compellingly ‚Äì to Aaron Sorkin's strengths.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper gave the film four out of four stars, saying: \\"Certain events are rearranged from the factual timelines, and yes, The Trial of the Chicago 7 exercises poetic license. This is not a documentary; it's a dramatization of events that resonates with great power while containing essential truths, and it's one of the best movies of the year.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised Cohen and Redmayne's performances and said, \\"Sorkin has structured The Trial of the Chicago 7 ingeniously, so that it's never about just one thing. It's about the theatrical insanity of the war in the courtroom, about how the government would stop at nothing (including flagrant attempts at jury tampering), and about the politics, at once planned and spontaneous, of how the Chicago protests unfolded.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Sorkin has made a movie that's gripping, illuminating and trenchant, as erudite as his best work and always grounded first and foremost in story and character. It's as much about the constitutional American right to protest as it is about justice, which makes it incredibly relevant to where we are today\\". IndieWire's Eric Kohn gave the film a \\"B\\", saying Sorkin \\"directs his own blunt, energetic screenplay with the convictions of a storyteller fully committed to the tropes at hand\\" and that Sacha Baron Cohen \\"steals the show and transforms an otherwise stagey period piece into something far more compelling.\\" See also * Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8 * Steal This Movie! * Chicago 10 * William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe * The Chicago 8 References  Further reading  * Sorkin, Aaron.

In January 2015, while on the terrace of a caf√©, Soliman witnesses an attack by masked policemen on a peaceful protest commemorating the fourth anniversary of the uprising of January 25, 2011 (\\"The Day of Anger\\"). She witnessed a protester, Shaimaa al-Sabbagh, shot to death by the police. Following this tragedy, Soliman voluntarily went to the Office of the Prosecutor to testify to the death of Shaimaa El Sabbagh during the dispersal of the demonstration by the police. She underlined the responsibility of the police, and lodged a complaint against the Minister of the Interior and the security forces. The prosecutor questioned her and informed her that a complaint had been lodged against her and four other witnesses for \\"illegal meeting\\" and \\"participation in a public security demonstration\\", despite her not having participated in the demonstration. On March 23, 2015, she was formally charged, along with sixteen others, with \\"unauthorized protest\\" and \\"breach of security and public order\\". On May 23, 2015, the Court discharged the charges against them, a judgment confirmed in October of the same year by the Court of Appeal, the Crown having appealed the first decision. The Allard Prize awarded to Soliman in 2017 On November 19, 2016, a new set of retaliatory measures started against her. While she was on her way to Jordan to participate in 'Musawah', a global movement for equality and justice in the Muslim family, led by feminists \\"seeking to reclaim Islam and the Koran for themselves\\", the airport police stopped Soliman from leaving the country. Shortly after, her bank froze her accounts as well as those of her law firm. Two weeks later, in early December, she was arrested by the police, taken to the police station and then to the office of an examining magistrate for interrogation. She was accused of falling under a new law on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), prohibiting NGOs from receive grants from abroad. These charges were confirmed by a court on December 14, 2016, and Soliman was prohibition from leaving the country and her assets frozen. A solidarity movement was organized to support her. The Allard Prize for \\"exceptional courage and leadership in combating corruption or protecting human rights\\" was awarded to Khadija Ismayilova in 2017. Soliman was a finalist and received an honourable mention.

The agency is also known as the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanic Committee South China Sea Regional Tsunami Warning Center, which is abbreviated as the South China Sea Tsunami Advisory Center (SCSTAC). It was founded in 2013 and is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China and the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center. The agency operates the regional tsunami warning system, which provides supervision and timely warnings to Chinese coastal areas and countries surrounding the South China Sea, including Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is a subsidized public institution, with headquarters in Beijing. The current director is Yuan Ye and the chief forecaster is Zhao Lianda.  History   Background and early history  China has three high-risk earthquake and tsunami zones, including the Bohai Sea, Taiwan's surrounding seas, and the South China Sea. These areas are mostly located in the Ring of Fire, and tsunamis‚Äîwhich frequently accompany large earthquakes‚Äîrepresent potential threats to China's coastline. In the early 1970s, the Intelligence Agency of the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) had researched tsunami and earthquake history. Past earthquakes in China, such as the 1975 Haicheng earthquake, the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, and several large earthquakes that occurred in the Bohai Sea, did not cause any noticeable tsunamis. This has led to the spread of claims in Mainland China that there have been no destructive earthquake-generated tsunamis in China. According to research on Chinese and regional tsunami history, however, China is considered to have frequent earthquake-generated tsunamis. China has the most deaths caused by tsunamis out of any country, accounting for one-third of all global tsunami-caused deaths. Not every large earthquake can cause tsunamis. Only shallow earthquakes with strong tectonic movements can generate tsunamis. Only one in four earthquakes occurring in the Pacific Ocean meet these criteria, which can explain the low frequency of the earthquake-generated tsunamis in the Bohai Sea.  Regional cooperation and establishment  In 2011, Yu Fujiang, the vice director of the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center (NMEFC), stated that the tsunami warning system established by China could send a warning to tsunami-prone near-sea areas within two minutes and to far-sea areas within 15 minutes. China, however, still had not established a tsunami advisory center, and the SOA was the only sub-agency regulating the Chinese tsunami warning project. In 2013, SOA Tsunami Advisory Center was established in Haiding District, Beijing. It was a subsidiary of the NMEFC and was considered the first major development in China's tsunami warning technology. In the 24th Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Pacific Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System in 2011, the SOA proposed that countries near the South China Sea should cooperate to establish the South China Sea Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System. In 2012, the second South China Sea regional cooperation conference was held in Malaysia. It focused on and approved the document of Construction Scheme of South China Sea Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System that was proposed and drafted by China. In September 2013, the 25th Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Pacific Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System officially reached an agreement on the establishment of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanic Committee South China Sea Regional Tsunami Warning Center, which built upon the SOA Tsunami Advisory Center and was abbreviated as the South China Sea Tsunami Advisory Center (SCSTAC), filling the long-term lack of a tsunami warning system in the region. In January 2016, the 2016 China Marine Disaster Public Report was published. In the report, the SOA announced that the administration was going to strengthen the operations of the regional tsunami warning system and relevant monitoring work, with a goal of mitigating the damage of potential tsunamis in Chinese coastal areas. On 8 February 2018, the SCSTAC announced its official trial run in offering service, becoming the first 24-hour international warning center in the SOA. On 8 May 2018, the signing and opening ceremony of the SCSTAC was held in Beijing. On 17 March 2018, the 13th National People's Congress adopted The 1st Session of 13th NPC's Decision on the Reform Plan of the Ministries of the State Council and approved the Reform Plan of the Ministries of the State Council. The Ministry of the Natural Resources was formed, replacing the Ministry of Land and Resources of the People's Republic of China. In November 2018, the SOA Tsunami Advisory Center was renamed the Tsunami Advisory Center of the Ministry of Natural Resources (TACMNR).  Advisory scope and service  monitor water zone of South China Sea Regional Tsunami Advisory Center of UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanic Committee The TACMNR collects data from around the world in real time, including data from more than 800 tide-gauge stations, 69 tsunami buoys, and 112 minute-level tidal observatories in China's coastal areas and surrounding islands. After the agency's establishment of a new system in forecasting tsunami figures in the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea, the forecasting processes of tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean, the southwestern part of Pacific Ocean, and the South China Sea can be finished within five minutes, one minute, and 30 seconds, respectively. This has cut two-thirds of the time it took in 2011, allowing for more timely tsunami warnings. The TACMNR monitors an area stretching from Taiwan in the north to Singapore in the south and from the Philippines in the east to Indonesia in the south. It mainly services countries including China, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The establishment of the TACMNR, its monitoring network, its regional tsunami warning system, and its tsunami disaster-reduction system have enhanced the ability to monitor, analyze, and predict earthquakes and tsunamis in the region. The TACMNR issues timely tsunami warnings to China's coastal areas and regional countries. This has also improved the technological research capacity in tsunami monitoring and built research groups with safety-guaranteed work. The TACMNR's tsunami warning system is efficiently structured, with adequate infrastructure and human capital. The tsunami warning and mitigation capacity of China and the South China Sea region have been notably enhanced. The South China Sea Regional Advisory under TACMNR aims to lower the frequency of regional tsunamis, offering to protect people and property in coastal areas worldwide. In May 2015, the SOA published the Contingency Plans for Storm Tides, Sea Waves, Tsunamis and Sea-ice Disasters, which illustrated that the Tsunami Advisory Center of SOA should analyze and confirm the level of response under emergency situations, play a leading role in marine disaster warning services, and issue national marine disaster warnings. Moreover, it should provide emergency solutions for marine disasters, as well as consultation for the Ministry of the State council, relevant army departments, and large central enterprises.

The region experienced widespread marine transgressions and deposition during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, that continued into the Cenozoic with the uplift of the Hindu Kush mountains. Stratigraphy & geologic history Afghanistan is underlain by Precambrian metamorphic rocks, which form high regions in the center of the country and in the Hindu Kush. The Central Afghan Swell, between Herat and Panjao is the northernmost structural high, encompassing metamorphic rocks. The swell is connected to the Hindu Kush by Precambrian rocks in Koh-i-Baba. The Shahrestan swell between Kabul and Malestan follows a northeast trend, but also extends to the southwest as the Malestan swell. Precambrian rocks outcrop locally west of Jalalabad, close to Kabul and Khost, and are likely present in the Safed Koh Range. Near Kabul, potassium-argon dating indicates that the rocks formed between 938 and 44 million years ago in the Paleozoic eon. In general, the Precambrian rocks in the Hindu Kush and Safed Koh Range are poorly studied. The Precambrian rocks of Afghanistan include phyllite, greenschist, garnet-mica schist and partially melted gneiss that experienced anataxis. Paleozoic (541‚Äì251 million years ago) Fifty to 60 meter thick limestones, overlying 70 meter thick dolomite, in the Panjao region host Late Cambrian trilobite fossils, dating to the time at which multi-cellular life proliferated. Non-fossil bearing sandstone, shale and limestone, southwest of Kabul are up to 680 meters thick, pinching out in the north. The formation underlies fossil-bearing sediments. South of the Afghan swell are several outcrops of Ordovician rocks. A researcher in 1970 reported conodont fossils from the Tremadocian in a one kilometer thick quartzite, shale and limestone formation. Close to Surkh Bum, Cambrian limestone is disconformably overlain by 60 meters of Ordovician shale and limestone, while to the southwest of Kabul in the Logar Valley region quartzite and shale ranges between 850 meters and 1.4 kilometers thick. Sediments 2.2 kilometers thick are present in the Dasht-i-Newar area, although they are not present in the east and southeast. Silurian rocks, such as 40 meters of black shale and limestone at Jalalabad, are only found in eastern Afghanistan. Ludlovian age limestone with orthocerid fossils outcrops in the upper Logar Valley. In the Dasht-i-Newar area, Silurian and Early Devonian clastic rocks grow coarser as it thickens from 650 meters of sandstone and shale to 2.2 kilometers of quartzite and conglomerate further east. Devonian rocks are limited in area, but widely dispersed containing extensive fossils. Early Devonian conglomerates with interlayered dolomite and marl outcrop in the central Afghan swell and the Hindu Kush. Some conglomerates show signs of tectonic reworking. Other units include 100 meters of marl and limestone near Herat, 650 meters of the same type of rocks near Ghuk and up to 100 meters of limestone near Panjao. Devonian rocks unconformably overlap older rocks in the Logar Valley and close to Kabul, with calcareous sandstones up to 700 meters thick. In eastern Dasht-i-Nawar, 1.9 kilometer thick early Devonian quartzite and intercalated conglomerate is over overlain by 550 meters of middle Devonian limestone. Late Devonian rocks are not present and an unconformity and conglomerate deposits point to a break in sedimentation. Tournaisian and Westphalian calcareous rocks from Carboniferous are distributed across the west, ranging from 350 meters thick at Herat to 400 meters at Kotale Shutur Chun. These rocks grade to quartzite and shale to the east. In the upper Kabul valley and Dash-t-Nawar, early Carboniferous limestone is 100 to 420 meters thick, disconformably overlain by 1.5 kilometers of quartzite and shale. A similar sequence is found north of Moqor. Several other locations have Carboniferous rocks such as the western Hindu Kush, north of the Shibar Pass or north of Salang Pass. In between Do Ab and Khanabad is a three kilometer thick sequence of early Carboniferous limestone, sandstone and shale. Afghanistan has numerous Permian rocks. In the west, south of Herat is a 150-meter sequence of dolomite and limestone. Permian rocks span the areas between the western Hindu Kush, Kandahar, Gardez, Jalalabad and Moqor. Carboniferous rocks transition to Permian sandstone and shale in the Dasht-i- Nawar and Logar valley area. A marine transgression emplaced 1.5 kilometers of limestone and dolomite and in places north of the Hindu Kush, Permian rocks lie directly on top of folded Precambrian basement. Mesozoic (251‚Äì66 million years ago) Triassic rocks are present north and south of the Hindu Kush-central Afghan swell area. To the south, limestone and dolomite 1.8 kilometers thick sits directly atop Permian limestones. In some places, there is no clear depositional break between the Permian and Triassic. North of the Hindu Kush, Triassic rocks unconformably overlie older rocks, with a transgressive sequence ranging between 350 meters and seven kilometers and composed of shale, sandstone and conglomerate. In the southern part of the basin, thick sequences of volcanic rock are common. Black shale near Badakshan has been found to contain extensive Triassic fossils. In the east, Jurassic limestone, marl, shale and sandstone conformably overlies Triassic sediments. Volcanic rocks intercalate these units between Kabul and Khost. To the west, Jurassic rocks are different: mainly sandstone and shale up to three kilometers thick, with subordinate limestone and marl. Close to Karkar, geologists have found 200 meter sandstone, shale and limestone sequence from the Middle Jurassic overlying coal. Researchers view the 650 meter thick sequence in the northwest as the remnants of deposition in the extinct Oxfordian age \\"Pamir Sea.\\" Like Jurassic deposits, Cretaceous rocks also differ from north to south. Between Asra and Khost, calcareous sediments interfinger with volcanic rocks. In east-central Afghanistan, 500 meters of sandstone, shale, marl and conglomerate overlies Paleozoic and Precambrian rocks. Conglomerate, greywacke and sandstone grading into limestone (rich in rudist fossils), sandstone and marl in the north and southeast suggests a large sedimentary basin. Limestone, marl and claystone up to 1.5 kilometers thick indicates a major marine transgression in the Aptian, from the north. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) South of the central Afghan swell, regional folding and faulting took place at the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the Cenozoic, with marine conditions only in the southeast. Around Khost, calcareous sedimentation continued until the Eocene. Beginning with a basal conglomerate, sedimentary rocks from the Paleocene through the Oligocene coarsen upwards in the southeast and between Khost and Sarobi. Nummulitic limestone and volcanic rocks intercalate with these sedimentary rocks around the edge of the basin. Paleocene and Eocene marl up to 300 meters thick interbeds with limestone and gypsum, unconformably overlying Cretaceous limestone in the north. These units are overlain by Eocene and Oligocene sequence 500 meters thick with tuff and lava intercalation. Tectonic activity began uplifting new mountains in the Neogene, bringing folding and driving erosion into intermontane basins as well as rift valleys and plains. Reddish conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, marl and claystone with small amount of travertine, gypsum and limestone from this age are dated to the Miocene and Pliocene. Similar sequences are found north of the Hindu Kush and the Amu Darya Depression holds up to 10 kilometers of material from the period. Clastic sedimentation continued into the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary. Early Pleistocene and Neogene sedimentations were often covered over coarse gravels with an angular unconformity as a result of intensive uplift in the middle Pleistocene. Glacial moraines are found above 3000 meters in the Hindu Kush and some north facing mountain slopes above 5000 meters still have glaciers. Natural resource geology Before the Soviet invasion in 1979, mining in Afghanistan was limited to lapis lazuli, rock salt, natural gas and coal. Jurassic and Cretaceous limestones and sandstones in the north near Shibarghan contain extensive oil and natural gas‚Äîin fact Cretaceous gas is more than 95 percent methane. The northern Jurassic basin has 20 known coal deposits, previously mined at about 140,000 tons a year, with total reserves of around 500 million tons. The Hajigak Pass holds 110 million tons of high-grade iron ore, with a concentration of 63 percent in hematite and magnetite. The Kabul ophiolite in the Logar Valley holds a high-grade chromite deposit. Sulfur is known near Balkh, talc near Jalalabad, beryl in Nuristan and fluorite to the north of Kandahar, together with Cretaceous rock salt near Taluqan.

Broadway Stages‚Äô studios can be found throughout Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. As of 2018 it has over 3 million square feet of integrated space including soundstages, locations, production services and parking.  History  Broadway Stages was founded in 1983 by Tony Argento who turned a rundown movie theatre on Broadway Street in Astoria, Queens into his first soundstage. There he filmed commercials, and music videos for musical artists such as Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Justin Timberlake, LL Cool-J, Eminem, Whitney Houston, Queen Latifah, Celine Dion, Will Smith, Hall & Oats, TLC, Busta Rhymes and others. The company expanded to Brooklyn where additional soundstages were built in Greenpoint, broadening from music videos to television and film production. Tony‚Äôs sister and current President and CEO Gina Argento, joined Broadway Stages after graduating from college,. Today the company manages over three million square feet of integrated space including unique locations, production services and more than 50 soundstages across New York City. In addition to New York City, Broadway Stages also has facilities in Pitman, NJ and Savannah, GA.  Locations and Services  Broadway Stages provides unique locations and the complete set of services for all sizes, styles and types of productions, including office space for writers and sketch artists, construction, wardrobe, lighting, storage, equipment and parking. Community Through financial, in-kind, and volunteer resources Broadway Stages actively supports economic and social growth, education, the arts, community betterment, and environmental sustainability throughout Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and greater NYC. A commitment to community, local/state resourcing and environmental sustainability is a cornerstone of their business philosophy. Environment In addition to remediating Brownfield sites and repurposing them for economically beneficial soundstages, Broadway Stages installed solar panels, and both farm and garden rooftops on several of their soundstages in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Solar Rooftops In 2010 Broadway Stages teamed with Greenpoint Energy Partners and Brooklyn-based Solar Energy Systems to install and maintain 50,000 square feet of solar electric facilities on five of its soundstage buildings in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. With a capacity of 1.6 MW, this project represents one of the largest combined solar arrays deployed on a private facility in New York, and the largest in the TV and film production industry. The solar panels have offset approximately one third of Broadway Stages‚Äô annual electricity consumption, provided improved air quality, increased reliability of the power grid during peak demand and created jobs. Kingsland Wildflowers Project In 2016 Broadway Stages collaborated with the New York City Audubon, Alive Structures and Newtown Creek Alliance to create a large scale, half-acre green roof on top of their soundstage at 520 Kingsland Avenue in Greenpoint. It donated the space, matched initial funding from the Greenpoint Community Environmental Fund, and continues to provide financial support for the infrastructure and garden maintenance. thumb The green roof was designed by Alive Structures and features species native to the Long Island Sound coastal lowlands, including native grasses such as stout blue-eyed grass and northern drop seed, heart- leaved golden alexanders, and asclepias tuberosa or butterfly weed ‚Äî a host plant for monarch butterflies that also produces silky seed pod fibers used by orioles and goldfinches in their nests. This bird-friendly rooftop wildflower meadow not only attracts wildlife, but also diverts rainwater runoff, and provides educational programs throughout the year. The garden is maintained by Alive Structures and the New York City Audubon together with the Newtown Creek Alliance manage the year-round educational programs and oversee wildlife monitoring through bat and bird microphones and swallow houses installed on the green roof. Eagle Street Rooftop Farm In 2008 the company funded New York City‚Äôs first-ever year-round, fully operational organic rooftop farm at their Eagle Street soundstage. Aimed at advancing the health of the environment and educating Brooklyn citizens about green initiatives, Broadway Stages provided Goode Green with its warehouse rooftop as the setting for Rooftop Farms, a commercially operated green roof program used for urban farming. During growing season, the green-thumbs with Eagle Street Rooftop Farm who cultivate organic produce supply a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, an onsite farmers market, and fresh produce to area restaurants. In partnership with the food education organization Growing Chefs, the Eagle Street Rooftop Farm also hosts a range of farm based educational and volunteer programs. For more information visit Eagle Street Rooftop Farm. Arthur Kill In August 2017, Broadway Stages acquired the former Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, located in the Charleston section of Staten Island, from the Empire State Development for $7 million. It is repairing the former prison and converting parts of it into five new soundstages. While under contract, before the closing of the sale, Broadway Stages spent $3.5 million to bring the prison up to code and brought production to Staten Island. Movies and television shows including Orange is the New Black, The Sinner, Blindspot, Ocean's 8, The Good Cop, and Daredevil, have filmed in the Arthur Kill facility.

Tectonics Mongolia has complicated tectonic and structural geology, belonging to the Mongolian-Okhotsk Mobile Zone, between the Siberian Platform and Chinese Platform. The basement rocks formed during the Paleozoic in the Precambrian as Riphean age ophiolite formations experienced rifting from 1.7 to 1.6 billion years ago and again around 800 million years ago. The closing of a late Proterozoic ocean generated the ophiolites and the oldest basement rock. The Baikalides and Altaid mountain belts represent the accretion of island arcs into the Paleozoic. The collision of small microcontinents like Amuria and the large collision between Asia and Gondwana in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic had a major impact on the region. Crustal extension created the Mongolian Plateau, while rifting, crustal thinning, block faulting and basalt eruptions produced terrain very similar to the Basin and Range province in the western United States. History of geological research Alexander von Humboldt and N.M. Prewalskii made the first geological reconnaissance of Mongolia. Russian geologists were active prior and after World War I, into the Soviet period, conducting expeditions into the Gobi Desert. The Russian Geological Exploration Expeditions from 1932 to 1937 discovered molybdenum, tungsten, tin, oil, iron, coal, evaporites and fluorite, followed by the activities of the Polish-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition from 1946 to 1949. Mongolneft, a state owned oil company launched in 1948. The Geological Prospecting Survey (renamed Ministry of Geology in 1961) was created in 1957. Natural resource geology Tectonic belts in Mongolia have a strong influence on where base metal ores have formed. The North Mongolian Metallogenic Province is part of the Mongolian Altai Caledonides, with a southern boundary at a deep fault near Bulgan. The East Mongolian Metallogenic Province covers two-thirds of the country and was highly influenced by Mesozoic magmatic activity. The South Mongolian Metallogenic Province is a third grouping. Iron ore forms as metasomatic skarn deposits and together with manganese ore is common in the East Mongolian province. Hercynian and Caledonian ophiolite structures seem to control for chromium, titanium and vanadium. Lead, zinc, copper and gold mineralization across all three metallogenic provinces. The Boro ore zone traces the Changajn and Chentejn mountains in the East Mongolian province with gold deposits. Triassic and Jurassic igneous deposits hold many of the country's metal resources in the same province. Deep-seated faults host mercury deposits. Northwest of Muren, aluminum deposits are associated with nepheline syenite and sillimanite gneiss. Ophiolite belts often host secondary nickel and cobalt-nickel ores together with chrysotile asbestos. The Bulgan fault zone mylonite hosts azurite, malachite, chrysocolla and turquoise. The Valley of Lakes is the center of Mongolia's extensive coal deposits, which date to the Carboniferous in the west and the Permian in the south. Oil is known from intracratonic basins in the southeast, centered around the Sajnsand oil field.

In 2018, she ran for Georgia's 7th congressional district, coming within 433 votes of defeating the incumbent Republican, Rep. Rob Woodall, in what was the closest congressional race in the entire country. On February 7, 2019, Rob Woodall announced he would retire at the end of his current term, meaning the seat would be open in 2020. That same day, Bourdeaux announced her intentions to once again seek the seat. Early life and education Bourdeaux is from Roanoke, Virginia. Her parents were both teachers, but the family declared bankruptcy when she was in school. She graduated from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in history and economics, aided by Pell Grants and Stafford Loans.

In the third quarter of 2018, Bourdeaux outraised Woodall by a margin of more than 3-1, raising over $1 million. The election continued to be close all the way through election day. On election night, the race was too close to call, and the winner of this race was still unclear. Just a few hours after it was filed on November 15, U.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May denied an emergency motion to force Gwinnett County to count previously rejected absentee ballots in the razor-thin 7th congressional district race.

It was officially announced on May 18, 2018 with a release date in August 2018. and released in the United States via AT&T; and Verizon Wireless on November 2, 2018 after multiple delays. The Hydrogen One's signature features revolve around imaging, including a 3D display (called 4-View or 4V) that uses diffracted backlighting to create depth effects, dual front and rear cameras that can take pictures and film video in the device's proprietary 3D format as well as standard 3D SBS and 2D, and pin connectors that were meant to allow the device to be integrated into other planned products (such as a 3D 8K camera called RED Lithium that was to use the Hydrogen One as a viewfinder).  Specifications  Hardware The Hydrogen One's design is influenced by the lens mounts of Red's cinema cameras, with aluminum and Kevlar materials. scalloped grips, and texturing; hardware buttons and a fingerprint reader are integrated into some of the scallops. It features a 5.7-inch 1440p LCD with 3D display technology branded as \\"4V\\" (\\"4 View\\"). Developed by the Red-backed startup Leia, it uses nanostructures to diffract the display's backlight into a light field, creating a \\"holographic\\" depth effect. The device features dual 8-megapixel front-facing and 16-megapixel rear-facing cameras, which can also be used to take holographic photos and video compatible with 4V. The front- facing cameras only support 4V in portrait orientation, and the rear-facing cameras only support 4V in landscape. There are expansion pins on the rear of the Hydrogen One for integration with other hardware. Red unveiled an 8K professional camera in partnership with Lucid, which supports 4V and could use a Hydrogen One as a 3D viewfinder. However, references to these products have since been removed from Red's website, citing planned \\"changes\\" to the Hydrogen program. It utilizes the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip, with 6 GB of RAM, 128 GB of expandable storage, and a 4500 mAH battery. Software The Hydrogen One ships with Android 8.1 \\"Oreo\\", and is bundled with several applications intended to showcase 4V-compatible content, including RED Player, the LeiaLoft app store for apps and games, Hydrogen Network for movies and shorts (which also includes film rentals), and the photo sharing social network app Holopix. 4V content is currently proprietary to the Hydrogen One and can only be viewed through the supplied apps, but RED Player can also play back standard 3D formats which can also be uploaded to Holopix. Red stated that the device would receive ongoing updates to improve its functionality and software. The AT&T; version is provided with 3D digital copies of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Ready Player One.  Reception  The Hydrogen One received mixed reviews. Its utilitarian design was considered to be a contrast to other mainstream smartphones, but that it also made the device large and heavy (however, CNET felt that this design made the Hydrogen One \\"satisfyingly dense and solid\\"). CNET felt that the display's holographic effect was \\"oddly reminiscent of lenticular printed 3D baseball cards\\", and observed mixed reactions from colleagues who were shown demonstrations. The Verge felt that the 4V display's depth effect was akin to \\"a paper cutout being placed on top of a flat background\\" that \\"creates some illusion of depth, but [is] very clearly artificial in most cases\\", and that the display seemed \\"smudged\\" when the 3D mode was activated. 4V video was criticized for \\"[tending] to flicker in and out and have lots of strange artifacts\\", and being \\"dizzying anytime there‚Äôs too much motion and the layers of depth are constantly changing\\". The limited amount of 4V content, and the quality of their effects, was also noted. In regards to its cameras, CNET described their image quality as being akin to \\"analog film\\", with 2D images showing realistic color reproduction (as opposed to the processed output of competitors such as Google Pixel 3 and iPhone XS) and detail, but that they struggled in low-light conditions, as well as medium-to-low-light video (a trait considered contradictory to Red's reputation as a professional video camera manufacturer). The Verge felt that 4V photos of people \\"generally end up looking really goofy, with the person appearing as a paper cutout on top of whatever was behind them\\". The quality of its Android software was also noted, as well as its use of the older Snapdragon 835 over the newer and faster 845. With a score of 7.9 out of 10, CNET concluded that the Hydrogen One needed polish, but \\"has a flagship price and flagship ambitions.\\" In contrast, The Verge gave the Hydrogen One a score of 3 out of 10, arguing that it \\"fell short\\" of the quality expected among phones in its price range, and acknowledging the shortcomings of the features that were intended to set the Hydrogen One apart from them.

She also studied with American dancer, choreographer and anthropologist Pearl Primus. In the 60s and 70s, Skanks‚Äô choreographic work merged European interpretive dance forms with dances and movement of the African diaspora. Throughout her life, she performed, taught and choreographed in Toronto and the United States for both stage and screen, with clients including CBC Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Mariposa Folk Festival, Caribana and the San Diego Museum of Art. She was on the faculty at the University of New York at Buffalo and taught at the Three Schools Artists‚Äô Workshop in Toronto. In 1974, Skanks opened her own studio in Toronto. In 2017, Skanks was one of ten notable dance pioneers inducted into the Dance Collection Danse Encore! Dance Hall of Fame. Images of Skanks were featured in Seika Boye's exhibit It's About Time: Dancing Black in Canada 1900-1970 which was shown at the Dance Collection Danse Gallery in 2017, OCADU's Ignite Gallery in 2018 and at the Progress Festival in Toronto in 2019.

Formerly, it was the oldest and best-known orphanage in Rwanda, however, in 2016 the government began closing orphanages and transferring the children under foster care and adoption to families. It was founded by Peter and Dancilla Gisimba in the 1980s. They took orphans into their home from the local community, until there were too many to house, at which point they transferred to a larger location. It was renamed the Gisimba Memorial Centre in 1990. In the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the Damas and Jean- Francois Gisimba (the founder's sons) along with American aide worker Carl Wilkens help hide and save 400 children, and even more adults, within the orphanage from the Interahamwe, or Hutu militia. On November 21, 2017, the former orphanage officially changed its mission. In a statement to the press, the director said, \\"We have turned the orphanage to Gisimba after School Initiative ‚Äì it is a training centre which will bring the youth together for several entertainment and education activities.\\" Media Brandon Stanton, the creator of Humans of New York, visited Rwanda in September 2018. Beginning on October 16, 2018, he began covering the genocide on his site through a series of interviews and photos from persons who were affected. On his site, he stated his objective: \\"During my week in Rwanda, I focused on the stories of people who took a moral stand during the genocide. These are members of the Hutu majority who risked their lives to shield and protect Tutsis. In Rwanda they are known as ‚ÄòThe Rescuers.'\\" In conjunction with the series, he hosted a GoFundMe campaign to benefit the Gisimba Memorial Centre in Rwanda and the planned the yet-to-be-built Gisimba House in Uganda. He supplemented the campaign with $13,000 from HONY's Patreon fund, as well as with $1 for every donation beyond the 5,000th donation.

He was a two times regular season MVP in both 2017 Summer and 2018 Spring LCK season. Bdd's signature champions are considered to be Galio, Azir, Taliyah, Orianna although his favourite champion is Zed.  Playing career  Bdd stands for (), which means \\"rice thief\\". Bdd joined CJ Entus as a sub mid laner in April 2015 but was unable to play for them due to being underage. Bdd was hyped as \\"super-rookie\\" and the biggest Korean mid laner prospect after Faker before his debut. He finally turned 17 on March 1, 2016, and he made his competitive debut in the 2016 LCK Spring on March 2 in a series against Kongdoo Monster, which CJ won 2‚Äì1. He finished the first competitive season at 8th place. CJ Entus had a very poor showing in the 2016 LCK Summer season, going 3-15 total in set score and relegated first time in history. Bdd alongside with all other members left the team after the season. In December 2016, Bdd announced his signing with Longzhu Gaming. However, he spent his whole 2017 LCK Spring season on bench. He was moved to starter in summer season and won the 2017 LCK Summer playoff as well as regular season MVP with 1300 points and set an all-time record of 11.3 KDA throughout the whole season over 44 games. In January 2017, Longzhu Gaming was acquired by a Chinese company and rebranded into KING-ZONE DragonX. Bdd won the regular season MVP and playoff again in 2018 LCK Spring season. He and his team represented Korea for Mid-Season Invitational but they only managed to get runner-up disappointingly. KING-ZONE DragonX finished summer season at 4th place and failed to quality for 2018 World Championship after losing to Gen.G in regional qualifier. On November 27, 2018, kt Rolster announced the singing of Bdd as their new mid laner. KT struggled in 2019 season and finished only at 9th and 8th place in spring and summer season. He left the team after a disappointing year in November 2019. On November 20, 2019, Gen.G announced the singing of Bdd alongside with jungler Clid and top laner Rascal as their new members through former Gen.G player and world champion Ambition's twitch stream.

The country has experienced long-running uplift events, forming the Tian Shan mountains and large, sediment filled basins. Geologic History, Stratigraphy and Tectonics The Precambrian tectonic evolution of the region is poorly understood. Geologists infer that the Northern Turkestan domain likely formed along the margin of the Proterozoic Baltica-Siberia continent. The Tarim Block may have belonged to Gondwanaland, based on paleontological evidence. Although paleomagnetic data for the Tien Shan mountains is lacking, some have suggested that the ocean closed to form the Turkestan domain may have been a branch of the proto-Pacific Ocean. The Paleozoic rocks in the Tien Shan mountains are the remnants of accreted island arcs, mainly from the Ordovician onward. During the Vendian, the Northern Turkestan domain was part of the Kipchak island arc system between the East European and Siberian continent, separated by the Terksey back-arc basin which had originated as a rift basin. The Tien Shan mountains began to form in the Ordovician out of three island arcs amalgamated by the subduction of Terksey oceanic crust beneath the Kungey Arc, Sandalash Arc and subduction of Paleotethys Ocean crust under the Yagnob Arc. The Kyrgyz Block formed in the middle Ordovician with closure of the Terksey Basin and then underwent deformation. Coarse molasse sediments lie unconformably on top of subduction-related granite intrusions and volcanic rocks. North and south of the Terksey Suture, formed during the event, late Ordovician collision-related granites. Into the Silurian, the Sandalash magmatic arc remained along the southern margin of the Kyrgyz Block. Turkestan oceanic crust was subducated beneath the Sandalash magmatic arc. By the early Devonian, magmatic activity was taking place in the northern Tien Shan mountains, likely as a result of the subducting Turkestan crust. Sedimentation occurred in shallow seas and on the passive margin of the Tarim-Alay Block. Magmatic activity resumed in the Carboniferous, with spreading in the Turkestan Ocean and renewed subduction under the Kyrgyz Block. By the late Carboniferous, collision between the Tarim-Alay microcontinent and the Kyrgyz Block was underway, emplacing large nappe features with ophiolite deposits on top of the Tarim-Alay basement rocks. Magmatism continued through the Permian in the Tien Shan mountains, accompanied by deformation and the deposition of molasse sediments in different basins. Structural geologists distinguish a number of tectonic features from the Paleozoic including the Nikolaev's Line, Talas-Fergana Fault, Turkestan Suture and Terskey Suture. Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago-present) At the start of the Mesozoic, depressions began to develop in the Triassic, accumulating thick, coal-bearing sediments. The East Fergana pull-apart basin aligned along the Talas-Fergana Fault. The western edge of the basin has delta sediments while the center of the basin reflects deep water sediments. Material and fossils continued to accumulate into the Jurassic as the units were folded. A shallow water basin covered the region in the Cretaceous, leaving behind salt water fauna west of the Talas- Fergana fault. Alluvial deposits mark the edges of the saline lake and Cretaceous deposits accumulated up to 500 meters thick. The lake became a shallow intracontinental sea, lasting into the Cenozoic. Lagoon deposits accumulated through the Eocene, until the sea began to retreat in late Paleogene times. The retreat was brought on with the collision of India with Asia around 50 million years ago. Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary rocks are up to two kilometers thick in the Fergana Basin. The Oligocene, the entire region had shifted to lagoon and continental deposition. To the east of the Fergana Range, there are no Cretaceous or Paleocene sediments. Continental sediments accumulated there beginning in the Eocene, formed clay, siltstone and sandstone, interbedded with thinner layers of gypsum, marl, conglomerate and limestone in river valleys formed in the central Tien Shan Mountains in the Oligocene and Miocene. These deposits range widely from several meters thick to several kilometers. They reach their greatest thickness of four kilometers in Fergana, Atbashi and Naryn basins. Tien Shan mountain rocks show no signs of folding from the Cretaceous through the Paleogene and lie with an angular unconformity atop basement rocks. Tectonic activity rapidly resumed in the late Pliocene, leading to erosion of continental sediments into intermontane basins into the Quaternary. Folding developed into the Quaternary in the Tien Shan mountains as global changes in climate brought on the Pleistocene ice ages. Most ridges in the mountain range are asymmetric anticlines bounded by reverse and thrust faults. Folding and thrusting is often oriented toward major basins like the Fergana, Chur or Tarim basins. Seismic activity Due to tectonic activity since the Pliocene, Kyrgyzstan has intense seismic activity on a regular basis. There have been more than 11 earthquakes magnitude 6 or greater on the Richter scale since 1865. The most activity centers on the Kyrgyz Ranges, Kungey Ranges and East Fergana region. Natural resource geology Kyrgyzstan is notable for significant deposits of antimony and mercury, such as the Chauvay, Kadamzhai and Khaydarkan deposits. These are examples of quartz-fluorite-antimonite-cinnabar (also known as jasperoid type deposits), while others are quartz-dickite-cinnabar or magnesian-carbonate- cinnabar (or listvenite)_ types. The primary types of deposits are common at the contact between Carboniferous limestone and overlying Silurian shales and Devonian sandstone nappe formations. Listvenite deposits are typically associated with serpentine m√©lange. Contact metamorphism skarn deposit gold, hydrothermal gold, pegmatite hosted tin, cassiterite-quartz and iron ore in Proterozoic slates are also common together, with smaller amounts of zinc, aluminum, lead, vanadium and uranium. Oil and gas are found in commercial quantities in the Fergana Basin in Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene sedimentary rocks. The oil is low in sulfur and the natural gas is dry with up to 72 percent methane. The South Fergana Basin, the Uzgen Basin, Kavak Basin and Southern Issyk Kul Basin all host coal deposits from the Triassic and Jurassic formed under continental conditions, with 70 percent hard coal.

The district covers the Northwestern suburbs of Boston and includes Lowell, Lawrence, Concord, and her hometown of Westford. A Democrat, she previously served as chief of staff to former Representative Marty Meehan in Massachusetts's 5th congressional district.  Early life and education  Trahan was born on October 27, 1973 and raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. She grew up with three sisters. Trahan attended Lowell High School, where she would later be inducted into the school's Sports Hall of Fame. Trahan described her family as \\"living paycheck to paycheck\\". Her father, Tony Loureiro, had Portuguese parents. His father was from Porto in northern Portugal, and his mother was born in Brazil to Portuguese parents and moved to the Azores to live with relatives as a child following her mother's death. Trahan's mother is of partial Portuguese ancestry (from the Azores). At Lowell High, she earned an athletic scholarship in volleyball to Georgetown University. She graduated from Georgetown University with a bachelor's degree in comparative and regional studies in International Relations.  Earlier career  After college, Trahan worked for Marty Meehan, member of the United States House of Representatives for Massachusetts's 5th congressional district, eventually becoming his chief of staff. In 2005, Trahan left the public sector to work for ChoiceStream, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based marketing software company. She became the CEO of the Concire Leadership Institute, a small, woman-owned consulting firm. U.S. House of Representatives  Elections   2018 general election  In October 2017, Trahan announced her candidacy for the November 2018 election for the House to succeed retiring Representative Niki Tsongas. Tsongas had succeeded Trahan's former boss, Meehan, in a 2007 special election (the district was renumbered as the 5th district after the 2010 census). In September 2018, Trahan won the Democratic primary election, the real contest in the Democratic district, after narrowly defeating Daniel Koh, the former Chief of Staff to Mayor of Boston Marty Walsh, in a field of 10 candidates. The victory was upheld following a recount. In the November general election, Trahan defeated her Republican challenger, Rick Green, garnering 62% of the vote. Tenure Campaign finance investigation On March 4, 2019, The Boston Globe published an analysis of contributions to Trahan's campaign in the weeks before the 3rd congressional district's primary where she beat Daniel Koh by less than 150 votes. In the last days before the primary, Trahan put hundreds of thousands of dollars into TV advertising and the Globe asked the question about the source of the money. Trahan offered an explanation to the Globe, claiming she used $371,000 in personal funds, but federal financial disclosures she filed in the late summer of 2018 appeared to show that she did not have the funds to cover such a campaign loan. On December 17, 2019, the United States House Committee on Ethics launched a continuing investigation of Trahan after congressional investigators found \\"substantial reason to believe\\" that she violated campaign finance laws in her election win in 2018. The Ethics Committee voted unanimously to dismiss the inquiry on July 15, 2020, saying in their final report that they \\"did not find that Representative Trahan acted in violation of House Rules, laws, regulations, or other standards of conduct.\\"  Committee assignments  * Committee on Armed Services ** Subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging Threats and Capabilities ** Subcommittee on Military Personnel * Committee on Education and Labor ** Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions ** Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Investment  Caucus memberships  * Congressional Hispanic Caucus * Congressional Progressive Caucus * New Democrat Coalition Electoral history Political positions In April 2019, Trahan said she supports the candidacy of the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020. In an Interview with WBZ-TV in April 2019, Trahan told the political commentator, Jon Keller, that she does not support the impeachment of President Trump, but said Congress should continue investigating the president. In December 2019, however, after the revelation that president Trump had spoken to the Ukrainian president about investigating his rival Joe Biden, Trahan told The Salem News that she supported the impeachment of the president saying Trump's \\"abuses in office a \\"clear and present danger\\" that requires action. On December 19, 2019, Trahan voted to impeach on both articles of impeachment against Trump.

By the 20th century, it had become one of the most globalized economies in the world, relying heavily on international trade with developed countries including Australia, Canada, China, European Union, the United States, Japan, and South Korea. It is a mixed economy that functions on free-market principles and has a sizable manufacturing and service sector and an efficient agricultural sector. New Zealand has the 54th largest export economy in the world measured by nominal gross domestic product. In 2016, New Zealand exported a total of NZ$35.1billion and imported a total of NZ$35.4 billion, with its top exports being concentrated milk and the top imports being cars. New Zealand has an extremely diverse market economy with a sizable service sector that accounted for 63% of all GDP in 2013. Other industries including mining, manufacturing, waste services, electricity and gas accounted for 16.5% of GDP in 2013 while the primary sector only accounted for 6.5% of GDP, despite continually dominating New Zealand's exports. The biggest capital market for New Zealand is known as the New Zealand Exchange. As of June 2018 the NZX had listed over 300 securities with a market capitalization of NZD $164.5 billion.  Overview  The economy of New Zealand has been listed as seventh in the world for Social Progression, a societal tracker that watches areas such as Basic Human Needs, Foundations of Wellbeing, and the level of Opportunity provided to its residents. However, New Zealand's economy used to be much stronger than it is today. During the 1970s, the New Zealand income level was higher than it was in many of the other countries in Western Europe leading up to the oil shock crisis of this time. Due to the fact that income levels dropped in relative terms and have yet to be able to fully recover, the percentage of New Zealand citizens living in poverty has skyrocketed and there have been further increases in income inequality. Furthermore, New Zealand has dealt with current account deficit issues since the crisis of the 1970s with these deficits peaking in 2006 at ‚àí7.8% of GDP, but falling back down to ‚àí2.6% of GDP in 2014. Regardless of this, the outstanding government debt, in 2014, stood at 38.4% of GDP and between 1984 and 2006, the debt owed to foreign investors increased 11 times to a total of NZ$182 billion. Undeterred by the current account deficit problems, the difference on external goods and service has typically shown positive gains in the economy. In the 2014 fiscal year exports outpaced imports by NZ$3.9 billion. Over the last half-century, the government of New Zealand has been able to transform the country from an agrarian-based economy, that was extremely reliant upon the British for access to their markets, to an industrialized, free economy that is able to compete with other highly developed countries on the global scale. Prior to the market crash in 2007, per capita incomes had risen steadily for 10 consecutive years and then receded in 2008 and 2009. However, for the first half of the decade debt-driven spending had driven growth and this, in turn, caused the central bank to continuously raise its key rate from 2004‚Äì2008, at which point it was among the highest in the OCED. New Zealand remains focused on expanding its free trade network as a top foreign policy priority as they were one of the earliest backing parties for the Trans Pacific Partnership and the second country to ratify it.  Economy before 1840  Meeting of Settlers and Maoris at Hawke's Bay, New Zealand Prior to the arrival of the Europeans in New Zealand, the land was occupied by the Maori. The Maori were Polynesian tribes that had built perennial establishments and exploited the natural resources of the land in order to provide themselves with a way of life. It was around the 15th century that exploitation of these resources slowed down, and the economy went with it. The use of capital during this time, such as clearing forests and building houses, was just enough to cover the population growth and minimal use of capital means that there was little total per-capita economic growth. Some of this slow growth can be attributed to natural events such as; volcanoes, tsunamis, earthquakes, and droughts. It was the warfare between the tribes that kept the economy going during these years as the construction and re-construction of fortifications would have used energy and resources from the tribes. It was not until the Europeans arrived bringing with them new technologies, ideas, plants, animals, and sources of capital that economic growth was seen in the New Zealand lands again. Many of these European colonies were reliant upon the Maori for food and the Maori obliged by providing the foreigners with goods from their lands. The Maori were keen to trade with the new arrivals and typically bartered with potatoes, corn, and flax for weapons, alcohol, tobacco and most importantly ‚Äì European tools and products. The relationships between the Maori and the Europeans did not last more than a few decades as the European towns and villages became increasingly self-sustaining and by usurping the fertile lands which the Maori used to grow their crops. By the 1830s, money was becoming widely used among the Maori and it was shortly after this that banks were established in the area.  Growing economy 1840‚Äì1930  Banks in New Zealand made a quick entry into society after the Europeans arrived. The first one, The Union Bank of Australia, made its first appearance in Britannia in 1840. It did not take long for others to follow suit and soon there were a large number of banks, state and foreign- owned, that emerged. At first, there was no central authority to regulate or administer the currency and so all banks operated independently and issued their own currency. Today, banks must be registered with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which the nation's central bank and issues all the currency. In 1851 the government opened the Colonial Bank of Issue which held the power and ability to issue banknotes, but this did not last long and the bank was closed in 1856. Infrastructure was something that was desperately needed in the young civilization as necessities required to support the economy and society had to be built from the ground up. It was during the 1860s that the settlers began to quarry for a variety of minerals, including gold. Towns and settlements sprung up and flourished near these quarrying sites and they gave the economy a temporary boost as resources were used up and the locals benefited from the business they received. There were long-term benefits from this quarrying as well as the desperately needed roads, railways, ports, and factories were put in place as people moved from site to site. Gold quickly became the most significant depletable resource of the 19th century in New Zealand. In the 1860s alone, gold export receipts contributed more to the economy than wool did and totalled ¬£46 million by 1890. The gold resource in its entirety was a relatively small one in the world market, but New Zealand was also an extremely small economy in the 1860s. This boom in the economy allowed Dunedin to become the richest of the New Zealand cities by 1880s, but the citizens soon found they would need another source of capital as the mineral quarrying was largely depleted by the end of the century. The amount of capital the settlers had was declining as they had mainly relied on the capital they had brought with them, upon their arrival, to sustain themselves. Settlements realized there would need to be another product which could be exported to generate revenue to pay for the upkeep of infrastructure and repay their debts. Wool became New Zealand's first large export staple, exported from the Wellington settlement towards the end of the 1850s. New Zealand began to produce and export staple goods at a rapid pace and it helped shape society as well as establish a tone for economic growth, none of which would have happened without the invention of refrigeration in 1882. This new technology allowed New Zealand to export frozen products such as meats and dairy to markets that had been thought of as unreachable. The economy relied largely on the exportation of dairy, meat and wool for the next 100 years.  Depression  From the late 1870s to the mid-1890s, New Zealand experienced a depression that was the result of quarrying a finite amount of resources. The depression was foreshadowed by the closing of the City Bank of Glasgow in 1878, which in turn led to a reduction of credit that was available to New Zealand. Many farmers lost their homes and lands and turned to \\"sweating\\" in the factories because of a lack of jobs for rural workers. Fewer immigrants arrived as people began emigrating to Australia. In 1888 there were 10,000 more people that left New Zealand than arrived and during the years of the depression, 1881‚Äì1890, the overall gain from migration was just 40,000.  1930‚Äì1990  Reserve Bank of New Zealand It was not until the 1930s that New Zealand established its own central bank titled The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, it was established in 1934 and was constituted under the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act of 1989 with its primary purpose being to provide \\"stability in the general level of prices\\". Before then, all monetary policy was decided in the United Kingdom and New Zealand Pound, which was the currency until 1967, was issued by independent, private banks. One of the first measures the new central bank took was to give itself the ability to implement its own economic agenda as it saw fit and quickly took strides to better defend the economy and people from the world markets. By the middle of the century, pastoral products made up over 90% of the country's exports with more than 60% of that going towards the British market, which established a heavy reliance upon Britain for access to its markets. Growth and production were strong and consistent beginning in 1935 following the Great Depression and lasting through the Second World War as both men and women worked outside of the home to contribute to the war. The economy slowed down following the end of the war, but surged again from the 1950s through the 1960s and was brought about by high demand for pastoral products and a labor force that was growing fast enough to fit right into the growing manufacturing sector. Trading had never been better for New Zealand and prices skyrocketed for virtually all of their exporting products, which meant that New Zealand was quickly climbing up the income rankings. During the 1950s, the income per-capita in New Zealand was 88% of that in the United States. This was helped by tough import controls, which gave the local manufacturers the ability to manufacture nearly identical products locally, expand their factories and operations, and compete against the much higher priced imports. The Reserve Bank's primary role during this time was to implement and handle the effects of the fluctuations in government spending as the inflation rates remained low through the end of the 1960s. The 1950s were exceptionally prosperous for New Zealand, but it was evident that Britain was beginning to look elsewhere in Europe for trading partners. This meant that New Zealand would have to struggle for access to the markets it once supplied with its products, especially once the United Kingdom joined the EEC in 1973 and all trade agreements with New Zealand officially came to an end. At the end of 1966, the price of wool was cut by 40% as it was replaced by a synthetic fiber and this posed a large issue for New Zealand as wool was one of its top exports and the entire economy underwent a diversification period as its solution. New Zealand began looking for an alternative source of capital via exporting goods as it was no longer able to trade with Britain. The loss of wool in 1966 and the depression of dairy and meat prices meant that change had to happen fast if the economy was to still operate at a functioning level. Through the 1960s, New Zealand had operated by exporting pastoral products such as dairy, meat, and wool. By 2008 the single biggest export good was tourism, bringing in over a quarter of the total export revenue and in 2017 export goods had increased another NZ$406 million. Other forms of diversification are still present; pharmaceuticals, milk powders and fine wool garments.  Think Big  New Zealand Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon was the face behind the Think Big strategy that was implemented during his time at the head of the National party. This strategy was devised to establish 400,000 jobs, following the second oil shock in 1979, and push New Zealand toward being self-sufficient in the energy sector. Massive industrial plants were built on New Zealand's natural gas reserves and a wide variety of new products for export such as ammonia, urea fertilizer, methanol, and petrol were produced. However, bad timing struck and many of these projects were available for use right as oil prices hit the ground, dropping from US$90 a barrel to US$30 a barrel within a few years. Due to these Think Big projects requiring capital to get started, the public debt shot through the roof from NZ$4.2 billion to a staggering NZ$21.9 billion 9 years later when Muldoon left the position of Prime Minister. It has been speculated that these debts have cost taxpayers over NZ$7 billion since the early 1980s.  Reform  Roger Douglas Between the years of 1984 and 1990, New Zealand underwent a period of large reform on the components that guide the economy and public administration. These reforms are sometimes referred to as Rogernomics, named after the Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas, who carried them out. There were a large number of changes to the economy and how it was run during Douglas' time as Minister of Finance, some of the changes included making the Reserve Bank independent of political decisions, subsidy-free agriculture, loosening import regulations, removing controls on interest rates, and more. These changes continued to be implemented under two different governments, helping to solve a wide range of economic restructuring and governmental problems, as well as generating a substantial amount of social change. New Zealand relied heavily on privatization to help with its reform period by selling off telecommunications, airlines, computing services, government printing offices, and many others. The government decided that many agencies in the economy should be viewed as profit-making and tax-paying enterprises.  Open economy  New Zealand's economy entered into the longest period of significant growth in 1998 and lasted until 2006. This growth came as a result of a newly diversified and deregulated economy and benefitted the economy a great deal. For the first time in history, New Zealand was running long-term fiscal surpluses in the OCED and unemployment had fallen to never before seen levels. Despite these improvements, the country remained stagnant on the international income ranking level due to higher interest rates stemming from an unwillingness to save. Nonetheless, New Zealand is still a top choice for foreign investors which totalled NZ$107.69 billion in 2014, a statistic which has increased more than 1,000 times over since 1989 when foreign investment totalled NZ$9.7 billion.  Economic outlook  Since the 1980s, New Zealand has gone from being one of the most heavily regulated economies in the OCED to one of the least regulated and most free market economy. Projecting an increase in growth of 3% for 2018, OCED believes that steady growth \\"will continue to be driven by strong tourism demand from Asia and increases in dairy exports\\". The stock market continues to show strong growth as well, rising 22% in 2017, held up by the economy growing at a rate that is above its long-term trend. GDP is forecasted to increase as well due to strong tourism growth, low-interest rates, and high net migration. Strong economic performance in the near term would greatly benefit New Zealand, but demand from government spending could be weaker than projected if the implementation of policy is slower than expected.

In Paris, she was influenced by the European avant-garde, most notably abstraction.

Soldevilla graduated from the Falc√≥n Conservatory for singing and the violin, founding the short-lived group La Orchestra de Lol√≥ (Lolo's Orchestra) before taking up painting in 1948.Jorge Domingo Cuadriello, Lol√≥ Soldevilla, www.subastahabana.com, , accessed October 2018. During the 1930s, she was a seminal political activist, enduring detainment for participation in several political rallies, as well as imprisonment in the Prison for Women in Guanabacoa, in 1935 for her positions against the Machado dictatorship. She also helped found the Partido Aprista of Cuba, along with Enrique de la Osa and Guillermo de Z√©ndegui among others and integrated the Executive National Committee for this political organization.Jorge Domingo Cuadriello In 1949, she traveled to Paris as a cultural attach√© for the Cuban Embassy and enrolled in the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, where she started to develop works that would later on that year, encompass her first two shows. Among her returns to Cuba, Soldevilla traveled extensively during her career, she was influenced by the avant-garde of several countries in Europe and Latin America including Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Austria, Germany, Venezuela, and Brazil among others. In 1951, she joined the artist workshop Atelier d‚ÄôArt Abstrait founded by Deswane and Pillet, with whom she collaborated with for two years; she also attended a course on engraving techniques with Hayter and Cochet.McEwen, Abigail. A Pioneer and Champion of Mid-20th-Century Cuban Modernism, Essay, , November 9, 2016. Soldevilla traveled back and forth from the island exhibiting her works and garnering a group of contemporaries who would soon help her expand the influence of concrete abstraction in Cuba. In 1957, after a stint in Venezuela Soldevilla returned to Cuba with her husband and fellow artist Pedro de Ora√° and together founded Galeria Color-Luz, gallery focused on Concrete Abstraction and the Ten Concrete Painters (Los Diez). Although Los Diez and Color-Luz were short-lived, lasting only from 1957-1961, Soldevilla kept painting and collaborated with several magazines and newspapers such as Revoluci√≥n. From the revolution in 1959 to the early sixties, she became the professor of Fine Arts in the School of Architecture at the University of Havana. In 1964, she founded the group of painters Espacio,Jorge Domingo Cuadriello and became a member of UPEC, a journalist union and the group UNEAC (La Union de Escritores y Artistas de Cuba) the Union of Writers and Artists of Cuba. Lol√≥ Soldevilla died in 1971.  History  Los Diez Pintores Concretos (The 10 concrete painters) were...\\" a group that established the style of ‚ÄòConcretism‚Äô or ‚ÄòConcrete‚Äô art in 1950s Cuba and fashioned a whole new, unique language of abstraction.\\"Odette Artiles, 3Concrete, \\"D FINE: Artists and Exhibition in the Rodr√≠guez Collection,\\" Henry Ballate (Ed.), pp. 136‚Äì141, 2018, print. Soldevilla's take on geometric abstraction played an important role in the development of concretismo in Cuba as well as in the international scene. Soldevilla's education in Paris and the bonds she formed between her teachers, students and fellow contemporaries led to her producing her most important body of work in the years between 1950-1957. Her collage work from this period is a study of the geometries of circles, rectangles, lines and colors, creating a rhythm with their variation of size and shape. Diagonals, opposing elements, contrasting colors and organic geometric style set Lol√≥ apart from her fellow contemporaries, as did her asymmetric metal kinetic sculptures.McEwen, Abigail The main philosophy of concrete art is that it is an extremely introverted art form, it has no narrative, no basis or reference in the natural world and has no defining qualities except the simple admiration of its colors and shapes. Soldevilla was a principal advocate of this style and movement. Just as Soldevilla's opening of Galeria Color-Luz incubated Los Diez, its closing in 1961 marked the official dissolution of the group after exhibiting together only three times. The last decade of her life would be spent in journalistic and literary pursuits, she worked with several magazines and newspapers and even wrote a memoir about her life in Paris entitled, Ir, venir, volver a ir: cr√≥nicas (1952-1957) (‚ÄúGoing, Coming, Going Back: Chronicles, [1952-1957]‚Äù).McEwen, Abigail An avid writer she wrote novels, plays and even a ballet. Although she exhibited little in the 1960s, she remains a seminal, revolutionary figure in the history of Cuban art and the flowering of concretism and concrete art.

Abortion Spanberger supports legal abortion. Economy Although not a member of Congress when it passed, Spanberger criticized the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Trump tax cut) because of permanent tax cuts for corporations that increased the national debt. Spanberger has called for the passage of the USMCA trade deal negotiated between the Trump administration, Mexico, and Canada. Environment Spanberger called climate change \\"one of the greatest and most imminent threats to our economy, our national security, and our way of life\\" and promised to \\"stand up to attacks against science.\\" She described the Green New Deal proposed by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a \\"bold compilation of ideas meant to address global climate change\\" but criticized it for allegedly including unrelated policy proposals and not identifying specific resolutions to the problems that it identifies. \\"Overall I am not a supporter of the Green New Deal,\\" she said. Guns Spanberger has called for a new version of the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. She favors requiring background checks on private gun sales and supported a ban on bump stocks.

She has voiced her support for stronger border security measures but opposes Trump's proposed wall. She voted for a bill that included funding for border infrastructure, technology at ports of entry and more customs and border patrol agents. She said that she did not support \\"sanctuary cities\\" but also referred to the term as \\"a campaign slogan a lot of people get caught up in.\\" She added that it \\"degrades the value of the conversation if we're not actually talking about what the real concern is.\\" Spanberger called for a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who abide by the laws, work, and pay taxes. Donald Trump According to FiveThirtyEight's congressional vote tracker, Spanberger votes with Donald Trump 6.9% of the time‚Äîabout one seventh of the expected tally (49.1%) when factoring in the district's partisan leaning and general partisanship in Congress.

On September 23, 2019 Spanberger joined six other freshmen Democrats in the House in calling for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. They co-wrote an opinion editorial in The Washington Post explaining their support for an impeachment inquiry, writing \\"Congress must determine whether the president was indeed willing to use his power and withhold security assistance funds to persuade a foreign country to assist him in an upcoming election.\\" Spanberger later announced that she would vote in favor of impeachment. \\"The President‚Äôs actions violate his oath of office, endanger our national security, and betray the public trust,\\" she said. In June 2020, Spanberger harshly criticized Trump after police used tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful protestors and a priest during the George Floyd protests in order to clear a path so that Trump could have a photo-op in front of St. John's Episcopal Church. Electoral history Personal life Spanberger married Adam Spanberger, and they have three daughters. In 2014, Spanberger and her family moved back to Henrico County. They live in Glen Allen, Virginia.

Manjutakin laid siege to the city over the winter, while the population of Aleppo starved and suffered from disease. In the spring of 995, the emir of Aleppo appealed for help from Byzantine emperor Basil II. The arrival of a Byzantine relief army under the emperor in April 995 compelled the Fatimid forces to give up the siege and retreat south. Background On 28 October 969, the Byzantine Empire reconquered the city of Antioch after an eleven- month siege. To give more strategic depth to the new possession, the Byzantine general Peter advanced on the Hamdanid capital city of Aleppo. After a 27-day siege, the Hamdanids surrendered in January 970 and agreed to become a Byzantine client state in the Treaty of Safar. At the same time, the Fatimid Caliphate seized control of Egypt in 969 and adopted a policy of securing the Levant as a buffer state against a northeastern invasion of Egypt and to advance their claims to leadership over the Muslim world, replacing the Abbasid Caliphate. An immediate conflict between the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimids was avoided because each side saw the other as a useful ally against the Abbasids, and because the Fatimids had trouble establishing their dominance over Syria. By the 980s, the Fatimids had subdued most of Syria. The rationale for friendly relations between the Byzantines and Fatimids looked more untenable. For the Fatimids, Aleppo was a gateway for military operations against both the Abbasids to the east and the Byzantines to the north. For the Byzantines, retaining Aleppo as a buffer was vital to prevent the emergence of a strong Muslim state on its frontier that could directly threaten the Empire. Prelude In 992, the Fatimids broke a 987 truce with the Byzantines and launched an invasion of the Hamdanid and Byzantine territories in Syria, inflicting major damage on them. Byzantine emperor Basil II sent the general Leo Melissenos to reinforce the Byzantine defences and launched an abortive naval operation against Fatimid Alexandria in May 993. These actions did not prevent the Fatimids from amassing a force strong enough to conquer Aleppo. Siege As the Fatimids under general Manjutakin laid siege to Aleppo in the spring of 994, the Byzantine doux Michael Bourtzes led an army to relieve the city. He was defeated and his army destroyed at the Battle of the Orontes on 15 September 994, with 5,000 Byzantine soldiers killed. In the aftermath, Manjutakin took over the fortress of Azaz and the lands around Aleppo. The Fatimids built a fortified village in front of Aleppo, replete with bazaars and baths, in which to quarter their soldiers for the winter. The population of Aleppo endured famine and disease as the months dragged on. The emir of Aleppo appealed to Basil II for aid, warning that should Aleppo fall, Antioch would be next in line. Basil II was busy campaigning against the Bulgarian Empire but recognized the importance of stability on the Byzantine eastern frontier. With a relief army in tow, he marched across Anatolia to Antioch in sixteen days, arriving in April 995. As the emperor's army approached Aleppo, Manjutakin burned his camp and promptly abandoned the siege. Aftermath As the Fatimid army retreated south, desertions mounted and the civilian population suffered due to the depredations of the marauding soldiers. Basil II's army went on to restore the lands of the Hamdanids and mount a failed siege against Tripoli. He soon returned to Constantinople by way of Antioch, leaving the eastern frontier with modestly increased Byzantine territories and with Damian Dalassenos as the new doux of Antioch. The emperor rejected a suggestion from his brother Constantine to annex Aleppo.

Its story follows Emma Woodhouse, a young woman who interferes in the love lives of her friends. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Johnny Flynn, Josh O'Connor, Callum Turner, Mia Goth, Miranda Hart, and Bill Nighy. It was released in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2020, and in the United States on 21 February 2020. It received generally favourable reviews from critics, and grossed $25 million worldwide.  Plot  In Regency-era England, wealthy Emma Woodhouse searches for a new companion after her governess, Miss Taylor, marries and becomes Mrs. Weston. Emma settles on Harriet Smith, a younger girl whom Emma supposes is the unclaimed child of a gentleman; Harriet's parents are unknown but her education has been provided for. Emma learns that Mr. Robert Martin, a tenant farmer of her sister's husband's brother, Mr. Knightley, has proposed to Harriet. Though claiming she will not interfere, Emma manipulates Harriet into declining Mr. Martin's offer of marriage, much to Harriet's distress. Emma believes that Mr. Elton, the local vicar, is in love with Harriet and encourages Harriet to transfer her hopes to him. At Christmas time, Emma's older sister and Mr. Knightley's younger brother come to visit. After everyone leaves dinner with the Westons early, Emma finds herself alone in a carriage with Mr. Elton, who declares his love for her. Emma promptly refuses him and Mr. Elton disappears for six weeks, eventually returning with a wife. Two much-talked-about members of Emma's social circle appear: Jane Fairfax, the governess niece of Miss Bates, and Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son from his first marriage. Emma grows jealous of Jane, but is entranced by Frank. Frank's arrival prompts the Westons to hold a ball, where Mr. Elton embarrasses Harriet by pointedly refusing to dance with her. She is rescued by Mr. Knightley, who asks her to dance. Emma and Mr. Knightley also dance together, awakening romantic feelings between them. Though Emma leaves before Mr. Knightley can speak to her, he runs to her home only for their meeting to be interrupted by Frank, who has rescued Harriet after she was set upon by gypsies. Harriet intimates to Emma that she has fallen in love again, leading Emma to believe Harriet is in love with Frank. Emma again vows not to interfere, but manipulates circumstances so that Harriet and Frank may spend more time together. Emma tries to spend more time with Mr. Knightley and is surprised when he repeatedly ignores her. On a picnic with their entire party of social acquaintances, Frank urges them to play a game to amuse Emma, who unthinkingly insults Miss Bates, leading the party to disband in discomfort. Mr. Knightley rebukes Emma for her behaviour, and a humiliated Emma apologizes to Miss Bates, who accepts her apology without question. Frank Churchill's wealthy aunt dies, and he is no longer required to be at her beck and call. The Westons reveal that he has been secretly engaged to Jane Fairfax and was waiting for the death of his aunt, who was opposed to the match. The Westons had hoped he would marry Emma, but Emma is only distressed on account of Harriet. Emma breaks the news to Harriet, who reveals that she is actually in love with Mr. Knightley. Harriet realizes that Emma herself is in love with Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley goes to Emma to comfort her about the news of Frank, and to reveal that he is in love with her and hopes to marry her. Initially pleased with his offer of marriage, Emma develops a nosebleed when she realizes how upset Harriet will be. Interfering one last time, she goes to Mr. Martin to make amends, offering him a portrait of Harriet she drew herself. Harriet tells Emma she has accepted Mr. Martin's offer of marriage, and that her father has revealed himself now that she is of age; he is not a gentleman, but a tradesman who makes galoshes. Emma congratulates Harriet and invites her and her father to her home. Though Emma and Mr. Knightley are very much in love, Emma is distressed at the thought of leaving her father alone. To accommodate her wishes, Mr. Knightley suggests that rather than have Emma quit her father's home, he join them there. Emma happily agrees and the two are married.

She primarily produces gestural, expressive paintings, often large and displaying vivid color, that include layered collage elements like cut paper letters spelling out pointed phrases and topical passages that tumble and pile up across her canvases. Background and education Raised in Saudi Arabia and Athens, Greece, Stokou is the child of civil engineers. She attended the German School of Athens in her youth. After first earning a degree in 1998 from the Technical Institute for Marketing and Publicity in Athens and then graduating from the Athens School of Fine Arts in 2002, Stokou received a DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program scholarship to study at the University of Fine Arts Berlin in the ‚ÄúArt in Context‚Äù department. In 2005, she received a Master of Arts there and remained in Berlin for the subsequent decade: ‚ÄúWhat attracted me to the city was this whole open space. I mean that in the spiritual sense also, not only the city itself.‚Äù In addition to her studio-based painting practice, Stokou was very active on the Berlin art scene and within the artist community there. In 2015, Stokou moved to Los Angeles. Painting  Stokou is known for transposing swaths of online textual data onto canvas. Boiling her painterly impulse down to an essence, she has said: ‚ÄúWhat I really try to create is a dialogue, a monologue, if you will. I‚Äôm very interested in communication and the way information passes‚Ä¶I look at the text and I want to paint it.‚Äù Her engagement with and use of text draws mainly from digital platforms and messages, tracking not only the content of social exchanges but the contemporary infrastructure that bears them as well. Tangled layers of text appear at points legible and illegible beneath abstract smears and swipes of color that together convey a sense of amped up, frenetic energy characteristic of her work. Writing in The New York Times, Roberta Smith described Stokou's paintings in her 2013 exhibition, ‚ÄúBulletproof‚Äù at Derek Eller Gallery, where ‚Äú[m]oments of legibility rise to the surface and then sink back into the works‚Äô eccentric, generally monochromatic tactility...Stokou's loquacious, streetwise paintings build on precedents from Cy Twombly, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Suzanne McClellan and Sean Landers to conjure an impression of colliding voices, opinions and needs.‚Äù Exhibitions Stokou has had solo exhibitions at Derek Eller Gallery (New York City), Praz-Delavallade (Los Angeles), Eigen + Art (Leipzig), EIGEN + ART Lab (Berlin), Appartement (Berlin), Galerie Krobath (Vienna), Apt Gallery (London), and Kalfayan Galleries (Athens). She has also exhibited at Kunstverein Gera (Gera, Germany), KW Institute of Contemporary Art (Berlin), Midway Contemporary Art (Minneapolis), and the Center for Contemporary Arts (Glasgow, UK), among other institutions. Her work is held in numerous private and public collections such as the Deutsche Bank Collection; Schwartz Collection, Harvard; and Zabludowicz Collection. Writing As a writer, Stokou has been a strong voice for women in arts, publishing polemical texts that are both provocative and highly entertaining, such as her article ‚ÄúArt is Genderful! An Artist‚Äôs Notes on Navigating a Sexist System‚Äù (2016). Her writing is distinctively playful, acerbic, and incisively cutting. Her writing has appeared in publications including Hyperallergenic, Artslant, Modern Painters, and Monopol. In 2010, Stokou founded Bpigs (bpigs.com), the independent artist-run art guide to Berlin, which she continues to edit and publish. Curatorial projects She directed the curatorial program at Grimmuseum (an artist-run space in Kreuzberg) at its inception from 2009-2011. While at Grimmuseum, she organized ‚ÄúThe Curators Battle‚Äù (2011) with curators Aaron Moulton and Carson Chan facing off in competing shows featuring the same artists, she curated ‚ÄúMadonna Psycho Slut,‚Äù an exhibition of twenty-one women artists, and presented the exhibition of her work, ‚ÄúDirty Dozen (D12),‚Äù both in 2010.

It stars Alexandra Hulme, who frequently stars in Brewster's films. It also marks the third film Brewster and Daly's Hex Studios has created with Dark Dunes Productions. The film premiered at the 2019 Glasgow Film Festival. Synopsis In a remote Scottish mansion an ancient doll sits, waiting to be evaluated by an antique expert. Despite being aware of the doll's history of being cursed, Dr. Brendan Cole is unprepared for when he and his stepdaughter Rose become the focus of the curse of \\"The Infernal Princess\\".

Cast *Alexandra Hulme as Talia *Erich Redman as Frederick *Jonathan Hansler as The General *Nick Ford as Officer Stille *Jamie Scott Gordon as Dr. Brendan Cole *Victoria Lucie as Rose *Stephen Kerr as Calder Production For the film, Brewster and Daly were inspired by a \\"wild mix of influences\\" such as Italian Gothic cinema, Mario Bava, Dario Argento, and Roger Corman. It was created over a three-year period and filming took place in Fife, Scotland, and Wales. Filming for The Devil's Machine was completed in April 2018. Brewster has described the movie as \\"the most ambitious film we‚Äôve produced\\". As with previous films, Brewster and Daly chose to use a different style and look than their prior film, The Black Gloves, citing a desire to \\"take our story to new horizons\\". To help with production costs, a Kickstarter campaign was launched in the spring of 2018 and by its completion in May 2018, became the site's most funded narrative film in the United Kingdom. Brewster broke a similar record with The Unkindness of Ravens, which was the highest funded British horror film on Kickstarter at the time. Originally, the film was titled Automata, but the name was changed to The Devil's Machine around June 2019, between the limited release at film festivals and the DVD production.

Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics  Uzbekistan's Variscan Paleozoic basement rock is divided into eight main zones. The Karakum-Tajik microcontinent has four tectonic zones in the metamorphic basement rock. The lower units of the southern Baysoon Unit are mainly late Proterozoic high- pressure metamorphic rocks‚Äîmainly meta-ultramafic or meta-acidic, gray and coarse. The exact origin of these rocks is uncertain, although they are inferred to have originated from island arc volcanism. They are overlain by unmetamorphosed carbonates from the late Silurian through the middle Devonian, with an angular unconformity at the base. Another angular unconformity above separates these rocks from volcanic and continental sedimentary rocks, with thick conglomerate at the base, ascending to pebbly limestone and metamorphic rocks. The upper unit is a thick cooled lava and tuff overlain by sandstone, conglomerate and Carboniferous plant remnants. The tectonic zone to the north has greater meta-pelagic rock presence and rare fossils from the Cambrian. The two peaks of metamorphic activity in the Karakum-Tajik microcontinent is associated with the time when the oceanic crust of the Turkestan Ocean subducted beneath the edge of the microcontinent. Collision with the Kazakh microcontinent produced a second pulse of metamorphism. Metamorphic rocks are present at the base of volcanic rocks, along with recrystallized limestone. Basalt lava flows, tuff, limestone and sandstone from the early and middle Carboniferous overlie these rocks, with a thickness of three kilometers. Diabase dikes, gabbro and serpentinite are also common. In Uzbekistan's paleo- rift zone, volcanic rocks and gabbro are up to thick, dropping to around the edges of the zone. The Karakum-Tajik microcontinent's other two zones cold high-temperature, but low-pressure metamorphic ophiolite complexes, overlain by Ordovician and Silurian flysch, tuff, andesite lava and shallow-water sandstone. In turn, these units are overlain by a thick carbonate sequence up to thick. Rocks left over from the Turkestan Ocean crust form allochthon units on the northern edge of the Karakum-Tajik microcontinent. In the western part of the Turkestan structure, in the Kyzylkum Desert, andesite lava flows and tuff overlie Ordovician-Silurian carbonate and pelite. Nappe formations, such as the Kulkuduk Unit are composed of basal serptinized dunite and lherzolite, with overlying harzburgite and layered gabbro. These are cut by granite dikes and intrusions and are overlain by tube basalt, pillow basalt and sedimentary rocks such as ophiolite breccia, green and red pelagic shales, limestone and olistoliths. Geologists separate the Kazakh microcontinent into two zones: the Tamdy and Kurama units. The base of the Tamdy Unit is metabasic and metasedimentary rocks ranging from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers thick and reaching blueschist grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. The lowermost unit is a serpentinized ultramafic m√©lange with eclogite fragments. It underlies Silurian-Devonian terrestrial and carbonate sedimentary rocks. These rocks are overlain by conglomerate and flysch from the Carboniferous, as well as acid tuff and Permian continental conglomerates. By contrast, the Kurama Unit has Proterozoic paragneiss, orthogneiss and granite intrusions in its basement rocks. Isotope dating indicates ages ranging from 1.9 billion to 230 million years ago for the metamorphic rocks. Vendian age sandstone and conglomerate intercalate with basalt, limestone and tuff, unconformably overlying the basement rock. Typically, these units are one to two kilometers thick. The Kurama Unit has volcanic rocks from the Ordovician, Silurian turbidites and andesite flows. An angular unconformity separates these rocks from a Devonian molasse unit, striking to the northeast with layers of andesite and tuff and overlain by a Devonian to Carboniferous carbonate unit. A volcanic unit caps the sequence, extending into Early Triassic age.  Platform cover: Mesozoic-Cenozoic  Sedimentary rocks deposited on top of the two microcontinents beginning in the Mesozoic. Faulting during the Triassic through the Early Cretaceous limited deposition to only a few small depressions. Sandstone, shale and conglomerate from the Triassic are found in the Ustyurt Plateau and southern Uzbekistan, containing units of bauxite deposited above an unconformity. Particularly in the Fergana Basin and the Kughitang and Zaravshansky ridges or the Gasly-Bukhara Depression, Jurassic coal and fine grained sedimentary rocks are more common, with thicknesses of 150 to 300 meters. Late Jurassic deposits are similar in thickness and include cross-bedded sandstone and conglomerate. Cretaceous rocks are most common in the Kyzylkum Desert, Gissar-Kughitang, Bukhara-Kiva Depression, Fergana Valley and around Tashkent, with carbonates, sandstones and red shales up to thick. Aptian and Albian age (based on marine fossils) gray sandstone, limestone and shale are more common in the west and south. In southern Uzbekistan, they are notable as oil and gas-bearing reservoir formations. Copper-rich sandstone is found close to the Gissar area. Except in the east, where bauxite and continental sandstone formed, the Cretaceous immersed Uzbekistan in a shallow sea that left behind limestone and gypsum. With the beginning of the Cenozoic, in the Paleogene deposition changed leaving behind a sequence with thick green clay at the base, overlain by limestone and then sandstone and clay in the east. In the middle Paleogene, thick sequences of gypsum and carbonate overlain by of clay, sandstone and carbonate formed in other parts of the country, producing oil and gas in the lowest unit. The thickest sedimentary rocks in the platform cover are from the Neogene. The lower unit, dubbed E type, includes sandstone, shale and conglomerate with layers of gypsum and salt. It is about thick, dating to the Miocene and Pliocene, much of it formed in lake environments. The Middle Pliocene unit is up to 3.4 kilometers thick and deposited in connection with rapid uplift of the Tien Shan mountains. The second type of sedimentation‚ÄîW type‚Äîincludes one kilometer of lacustrine carbonate with small layers of gypsum, sandstone and salt, as well as a top unit of red shale and sandstone. During the last 2.5 million years in the Quaternary, sedimentary rocks deposited in river valleys, and repeating layers with conglomerate at the base ascending to sandstone and shale indicate four different phases of uplift. The Kyzylkum (or \\"red sand\\") Desert has thick red sand dunes from the Quaternary.

It is considered as an old animal husbandry branch and usual for around the country. Production in variety fields such as wool, meat and dairy products makes sheep farming leading animal husbandry field in the country. There are few pasture areas in Azerbaijan and it shows negative impact on the productivity of the sheep breeding.  Trends in statistics  According to the statistics in 2014 there were 8.7 million sheep and goats in the country. The production of mutton and wool in the country are respectively, 70 000 tons and 17 000 tons. Statistics reveal that there were got about 2 kg wool from per sheep in a year.  Breeds  Native aboriginal breed is Karabakh sheep and local conditions are considered convenient for farming. Their physical appearance is big and light gray or brown colored. Compared to the other breeds their food demand is less but their weight is high. The main sheep and rams weigh respectively, up to 50 and 80 kilos. They are able to travel 25 kilometers in a day. They are resistant to the local conditions and diseases. People get more than 130 lambs from each hundred sheep. Another native sheep breed is Garadolag. They are mainly spread in the mountainous pastures in the country. This breed is popular for their high productivity of dairy products, large and sophisticated physical and skeleton structure. The average weight of the lambs is approximately 4-6 kilos, but average weight of the main sheep reaches 46 kg, while the live weight of the rams is up to 80 kg. In comparison, Garodolag breeds are widely used in cross-breeding than other breeds. Azerbaijan Mountain Merino breed was established in 1947 by the participation of F. Malikov and M. Sadigov. In order to create new breed, they cross-breed foreign Merino breeds with Askania in the farms of Shamkir and Gadabay. This breed distinguishes for their high productivity of wool. People get approximately, 4-5 kilos wool from the main sheep and up to 10 kg from rugs. Absheron sheep belongs to the Caucasian group. They are long tailed, semi-rough woolen and high productive sheep. Mainly distinguished as a fast-growing, extreme climate resistant and large-sized species. By the initiative of the agricultural scientist Najaf Najafov Absheron breed was created as a result of the cross- breeding with local Qala sheep. Their adaptation to extreme conditions was scientifically researched and confirmed. Their semi-rough wool is widely used in carpet weaving around the country. Balbas breed is widely spread in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and considered as a largest sheep. In the neighboring countries such as, Armenia, Iran and Turkey they widely spread. Average sheep are tall and white with black spots on their legs. They are woolen and hornless. The weight of the main sheep is 50 kg and rugs are 65 kilos. Their tails weigh about 16-20 kilos. Bozak sheep are cultivated in the western part of the country especially in Ganja ‚Äì Gazakh region and considered as an old and native breed. At the same time, they spread in the neighboring countries like Georgia and Armenia. The weight of the main sheep is about 50 - 65 kilos and they are mainly gray colored. The name of the breed comes from their colors. Caro sheep are mainly spread on the south-eastern districts of Azerbaijan. They are mostly cultivated in Lankaran and considered as less productive breeds. During the lactation period, farmers get up to 60 liters of milk and less than three kilos wool. Their wool is basically white, brown and black and the main sheep weigh about 50 kg. Herik sheep is mainly cultivated in Shaki, Gakh and a number of neighboring districts. They have several common signs with Lezgin sheep. Lezgin sheep. In the 19th and 20th century this breed is widely spread in the country. The homeland of the Lezgin sheep is considered as Dagestan. That is why they are mostly cultivated in the bordering districts with Dagestan such as, Guba, Gusar, Balakan, Zagatala, Gakh, Shaki, Oguz and partly in Goychay and Agdash. Their productivity is not high, so the main sheep weigh 40 ‚Äì 65 kg and 2 kg wool and up to 40 liters of milk people get during the farming. They are basically, white, gray or black- brown colored. Mazhik sheep widespread in the areas of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and Armania, Turkey and Iran. They have a number of productive features that makes them more cultivated breed in the region. 130 liters of milk they can produce and their physical appearance is good. Rugs have horns and sheep are hornless. Their tail is up to 15 kg and wool is mainly golden or brown colored and not rough. Gala sheep. This sheep was created as a result of the selection in Gala village is situated in Absheron peninsula. They are cultivated in a limited area. That is why Gala sheep is considered as sheep's papules. However, Gala sheep is also ancestor of the productive Absheron sheep breed which created by the scientist N. Najafov.

He was born in Kazan, Tatarstan. After he had completed his schooling, he worked in a metal plant for a few years. In 1941, he graduated from the Physics faculty of Moscow State University. After seeking the advice of a senior fellow (and eventual Nobel laureate), Vitaly Ginzburg, he was persuaded by Ginzburg to apply for a postgraduate course at FIAN (the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (LPI)). Rabinovich became a postgraduate student of Evgenii Feinberg and a junior researcher in the LPI from 1945, once Ginzburg had changed Feinberg's mind about accepting him; this arrangement notwithstanding, Feinberg told Rabinovich not even to call him. From 1948, he was a senior researcher in Vladimir Veksler's laboratory (and he later wrote his epitaph in the scientific press). That year he also gained a Ph.D. in Physical and Mathematical Sciences. From the early 1950s, he was established as a leading Soviet expert in accelerator theory and, along with Veksler, received state prizes for his work. In particular, he supported research on stellarators. In 1957, he started the LPI's Laboratory for Fusion and Plasma Physics. In 1959, he was granted a professorship at the LPI. He founded the journal Fizika Plasmy (Plasma Physics). He remained in his role as the head of the laboratory for the remainder of his life. He died in Moscow aged 63 after a long illness.

At only wide, it is one of the narrowest commercial buildings in the world, rivaling the Sam Kee Building in Vancouver which is considered the narrowest by Guinness World Records. The Kee building is wide at the ground floor, but has overhanging bay windows on the second floor that extend to . The Skinny Building's narrow lot was created in 1903 by a street widening project, and the building itself was constructed in 1926 by Louis Hendel (c. 1874‚Äì1945), partly out of spite for neighboring business owners who complained about him obstructing the sidewalk with his fruit-selling business. Due to the building's impractical dimensions, the second and third floors have not seen much use, but the ground floor has housed a number of different businesses including a popular lunch counter. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property in the Fourth Avenue Historic District. History Origins The narrow lot on which the building stands originated in 1903, when Diamond Street (now Forbes Avenue) was widened in order to ease downtown traffic congestion. This required the demolition of several buildings on the north side of the street between Smithfield Street and Market Square, one of which was a two-story brick store owned by Hugh McKee. After the widening, only a by strip remained from McKee's formerly standard-sized lot. Other inconveniently sized parcels were consolidated into neighboring properties, but Greek- American entrepreneur D. J. Demas saw a business opportunity and secured a ten-year lease on McKee's lot. The Pittsburgh Gazette reported that \\"A frame building of 'shack' proportions is now being erected on the site. In this narrow stand will be a shoe shining emporium, an ice cream and soda dispensary, a peanut market, and a fruit stand.\\" In 1907, Andrew Mellon bought the property from McKee for $40,000. Mellon sold the building in 1918 to one of its tenants, fruit vendor Louis Hendel, who paid $95,000. At the time of the sale, the Post-Gazette reported \\"The property has an obsolete improvement consisting of a one-story building. Mr. Hendel's place of business is in the rear, a cigar stand occupies the front, while a small restaurant is conducted in the intervening space.\\" Hendel continued to run his business for the next eight years, but had frequent run-ins with authorities and other business owners over sidewalk obstruction issues, as there was no room for customers inside the store. He earned particular enmity from the Diamond Street Sidewalks Association, which placed ads in local papers asking \\"Is this man higher than the law?\\" Hendel Building Despite the bad press, Hendel decided in 1926 to double down on his investment by building a new three-story building on the site. According to family members, he was motivated at least partly by spite for his hostile neighbors. Work started on July 29, and the first tenants, a cigar store and a restaurant, signed their leases in early December. In 1928, the Lincoln Restaurant opened on the top two floors, catering to African-American customers who had few places to eat in the area. The Pittsburgh Courier reported that Hendel, a Jew, was sympathetic to the black community: \\"Mr. Hendel owns the building in which the restaurant is located. Through his friendship with [restaurant proprietor] Mr. Jefferson and the desire to help the colored race, he has leased this property, disregarding the bitter comments of the nearby white business men, in order that we might have a decent place to eat in the downtown section.\\" Advertising \\"cozy booths for two\\" in the \\"world's narrowest building\\", the restaurant was said to have a row of narrow tables along one wall like a dining car, and \\"drew a patronage composed chiefly of the curious.\\" Evidently it was not a successful venture as it was already out of business by 1931. While the upper levels of the building did not see much use, the ground floor housed a number of tenants over the years, including Hendel's original fruit store. Although it eventually outgrew the space, the company survived until the 1980s. (Hendel himself died in 1945 in Miami Beach.) Another successful tenant was a lunch counter called Raywell's, which operated from 1938 to 1979. Patrons of the restaurant sat on stools with their backs to the street, facing a narrow counter with about of space behind for the employees‚Äîtoo narrow for the two waitresses to pass each other. A grill was installed in the corner. The building has housed various businesses since Raywell's closed and as of 2015 was occupied by a clothing store. In 2000, the Hendel Building was proposed for demolition as part of the Market Place redevelopment project, though this ultimately did not come to fruition. However, the debate brought attention to the unusual building. In 2001, community activists turned the upstairs windows into an outward-facing art gallery displaying \\"images of, variously, graffiti art, vintage strippers and the late sportscaster Myron Cope\\". It was listed as a contributing property in the Fourth Avenue Historic District when the boundaries of the district were increased in 2013. That same year, the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority bought the building, along with the neighboring Roberts Jewelers building, for $1.3 million. The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation used leftover money from a state grant to renovate the exteriors of both buildings in 2014. Architecture The Skinny Building is long and wide. It is a three-story, steel-framed building with a brick, wood, and glass facade. The Forbes Avenue elevation is four bays wide with large, multi-pane windows. The windows vary in size, but each has a central casement flanked by large panes on either side, with three or five small multi-pane transom lights above. The short sides of the building, facing Wood Street and Book Way, are one bay wide and have single-pane windows with multi-pane transom lights. The top of the building has a projecting cornice and a hipped tile roof that slopes up toward the neighboring Roberts building. The upper floors are accessed by narrow, steep staircases; there is also reportedly a basement.

Organizational structure The Sparkasse zu L√ºbeck AG has been registered in the commercial register since 1 November 2004 as a stock corporation. The legal basis for the bank is essentially the Kreditwesengesetz (KWG) and the Sparkassengesetz for Schleswig-Holstein. The bodies of the savings bank are the Annual General Meeting, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board. History The savings bank was founded in 1817 under the name \\"Spar- und Anleih-Kasse\\" as a dependent Gesellschaft zur Bef√∂rderung gemeinn√ºtziger T√§tigkeit (institution of the society for the promotion of charitable activity). The first business day was June 12, 1817. It was held in the now-defunct orphanage near the L√ºbeck Cathedral. The core task of the new bank was to give the city, which was devastated by the Napoleonic occupation and the following wars of liberation, and its inhabitants an opportunity \\"to secure the return on their savings or their purchases safely and affordably\\", thus at the same time to act as a capital collection point. The deposits were lent mostly as mortgage loans. As a result of the recently introduced B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch (Civil Code), the savings bank obtained in 1905 legal independence in the legal form of a foundation. As early as 1825, the savings bank moved from the orphanage to a new premise at Breite Stra√üe 16. In 1912, the bank moved into the newly built commercial building Breite Stra√üe 18 next- door. At this point, in the 1965 built house, the seat of the Sparkasse is still today. In 1937 the Sparkasse zu L√ºbeck, which at that time still carried the name Spar- und Anleihe-Kasse zu L√ºbeck , took over the Sparkasse in Travem√ºnde. The name Sparkasse zu L√ºbeck was adopted by the bank in 1958. In 2004, the bank's banking operations were spun off the foundation and transferred to a public limited company, today's Sparkasse zu L√ºbeck AG. The foundation that had once supported the Sparkasse became a nonprofit organization, the Gemeinn√ºtzige Sparkassenstiftung zu L√ºbeck, holding the majority in the Sparkasse zu L√ºbeck AG with 74%. From its interest and dividends, the foundation supports charitable and benevolent projects in L√ºbeck with millions each year. The remaining shares are held by Haspa Finanzholding in Hamburg. Business focus The Sparkasse zu L√ºbeck AG operates in its business area as a savings bank in the universal banking business. Among others, it cooperates with LBS Bausparkasse Schleswig- Holstein-Hamburg AG, Provinzial NordWest, insurer neue leben in Hamburg, HSH Nordbank, LGS Leasinggesellschaft Deutsche Leasing AG and DekaBank. Not infrequently, the Sparkasse zu L√ºbeck was a pioneer in the introduction of new products. In 1985, for example, the Sparkasse zu L√ºbeck was the first savings bank in Schleswig-Holstein to issue listed bearer bonds and, since 2004, the first savings bank in the federal territory to issue debentures.

Tielsch in Pittsburgh. The attack was motivated by antisemitic hate.  Background  Neal Rosenblum was the third of five children in an Orthodox Jewish family in Toronto. He was a rabbinical and computer science student. He married Manya Weingarten of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh in the spring of 1985. As a devout Orthodox Jew, he prayed three times daily, attending services at synagogue or at Jewish schools. Alt URL A month after their daughter was born, the family visited Mrs. Rosenblum's parents, intending to stay for Passover. Rosenblum was 24 or 25 years old at the time.  The murder and immediate aftermath  A few hours after arriving at his in-laws' house in Squirrel Hill, Rosenblum went to pray the evening services at the Kollel Bais Yitzchok Torah Institute Study Center. As he walked home from the synagogue, a car pulled up, and the passenger engaged him in conversation. The passenger then shot him five times. He was killed because of his Jewish appearance, wearing Haredi attire such as a black fedora. Rosenblum was still conscious when emergency workers arrived, and he provided some details of the attack. He died about five hours later while in surgery at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Investigators were unable to develop leads for 12 years.  Development of case  In 1988, Tielsch and Sanford Gordon shared a cell in the Allegheny County jail, both on separate drug charges. Tielsch bragged that he had killed a Jew, and would often make antisemitic remarks and draw swastikas, a common antisemitic symbol, on himself. Gordon reported the information to the authorities, but they did not have enough evidence to make the case in 2000. At that time, the Cold Case Squad took over the investigation and got a corroborating witness. Twelve years after the original crime, police arrested the now 45-year-old killer.  Trials  Gordon was the star witness in all the trials. In the first three trials, an extensive roster of witnesses was used, many of them jailhouse informants or otherwise unsavory characters. For the fourth trial, the prosecutor streamlined the case, using more technologically advanced presentation such as PowerPoint and far fewer witnessess, concluding the proceedings in half the amount of time. Tielsch's leg tattoo of a swastika was not admitted into evidence. His attorney argued that it could not be proven that he had already had the swastika at the time of the murder. Tielsch's first three trials ended in a deadlocked jury. He was convicted of third- degree murder in a fourth trial in 2002, with a sentence of 10 to 20 years. The judge in the latter trial, Lawrence O'Toole, declared that the jury was giving the defendant a break by limiting charges to 3rd degree murder. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upheld the decision in 2007. Tielsch was released from prison on October 23, 2017, after serving 15 years of the maximum 20.  Media  The prosecutorial doggedness in pursuing multiple trials generated controversy. The prosecutor explained it as due to the heinous nature of a hate crime, while the local newspaper rejected hate crimes as deserving special treatment. The newspaper's response drew public criticism. After the Pittsburgh synagogue mass shooting in 2018 that killed 11 and injured 6, major media revisited the Rosenblum murder, which was also an anti-Semitic shooting attack that took place in the same neighborhood, and one in which the shooter also had no relationship with the victim.

Function According to Intimacy Directors International, a nonprofit organization founded in 2016 by Alicia Rodis that advocates for the function, an intimacy coordinator is expected to ensure that: *all staff and actors are aware of the context of the intimacy as part of the story, *communication about the intimacy takes place among participants and avenues for reporting harassment are available, *actors continually consent to all scenes of intimacy, *all scenes of intimacy are performed according to a previously agreed-to choreography, and *actors are encouraged to mark the end of each intimate scene with a moment to signal the return to real-life interaction. The role of intimacy coordinator is not to be confused with that of an \\"intimacy choreographer\\", who specializes in the techniques of staging intimate scenes. History Demand for the role grew in the U.S. entertainment industry after the 2017 Weinstein scandal and the Me Too movement highlighted the often routine nature of sexual harassment and misconduct in the industry. Actors such as Emily Meade began to demand professional safeguards for their well-being on set, noting that given the structure of power in a production, actors (particularly young, inexperienced ones) might otherwise not feel able to speak up if directors, staff members or other actors disregarded their consent or previous agreements regarding intimate scenes. In 2017, the London talent agency Carey Dodd Associates fronted a campaign for an industry standard in handling scenes of intimacy using guidelines developed by Ita O'Brien. In October 2018, the television network HBO adopted a policy of using intimacy coordinators for all its series and films with intimate scenes. Intimacy coordinators and intimacy workshop teaching best practices for intimate scenes were also beginning to be used in London theaters as of 2018. In January 2019, Netflix released Sex Education, its first production that used an intimacy coordinator, Ita O'Brien.

It was later popularly known as Temulji's Lying-in Hospital and he came to be symbolic of \\"Parsi motherhood\\". Nariman headed the maternity hospital for twenty one years and joined the Governor's council in 1910. In 1902, he prepared an essay describing his time at Grant Medical College (1867 to 1902). Among the descriptions of the training and examination arrangements there he noted that the college physicians were often in competition with local \\"quacks\\" and unqualified medical practitioners known as vaids and hakims who offered traditional remedies and sometimes were able to claim a success when a patient who was already close to recovery was transferred to their care.

Design Tech was founded in 2014 by a group of four educators: Nicole Cerra, Ken Montgomery, Christy Knott, and Wendy Little, along with community members Sandra Feder, Ron Drabkin, Betsy Corcoran and David Little.https://web.archive.org/web/20130901005427/http://designtechhighschool.org/i-hs- partners Montgomery, who had previously been the Assistant Principal of Capuchino High School, was inspired by his studies at Stanford, where he attended classes at the Stanford d.school. The group began planning of the school and opened in time for the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, with a temporary campus in a hallway at Mills High School in Millbrae, California. The first class of d.tech graduated in 2018.https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mdN5DfLOI5uhu2NDW-E47nX0DK1vNwSNJDjB- TuDSFU/edit#slide=id.g363534c87d_0_84 The school remained there for the entirety of the year, but students and parents of Mills complained about the school's presence. The next school year, d.tech migrated to a former auto body shop, nearby in an industrial area of Burlingame on Rollins Rd. During that school year, d.tech was offered the opportunity to design and build a building on a waterfront plot of land on the Oracle campus in Redwood City, California. Throughout the year, students and faculty met with Oracle's architectural team to help design the new building, and it was completed in January 2018. As of 2019, Design Tech offers multiple courses out of the usual high school curriculum, including Creative Writing, Photography, Model United Nations, and Design Thinking. While the school does not have a standard Physical Education program, it offers sports such as sailing, basketball, soccer, volleyball, and baseball.  Campus  Mills High School Design Tech's first campus was at Mills High School in Millbrae, California. In spring 2014 SMUHSD offered six classrooms at Mills essentially rent-free, based on the requirements of Proposition 39, which mandates that charter schools be offered facilities \\"reasonably equivalent\\" to public schools. School leaders had initially requested space at Burlingame High School, but district officials stated there was no space at BHS. Intended to be a temporary campus, d.tech was located within a single hallway at Mills. In the first two weeks of school at the Mills campus, instead of attending academic classes, students were tasked with designing their classroom layouts. They were also required to take a field trip on the second day of school due to Mills' first day of school. However, students and parents of Mills complained about the presence of d.tech on their campus, capped by a contentious SMUHSD Board of Trustees meeting where State Senator Jerry Hill declared he would ask a civil grand jury to investigate the Board's responsiveness to citizens, and d.tech began planning their relocation within a few months. Rollins Road Design Tech began to rent a large warehouse, previously an auto-body repair school, to use as their campus. It was located in Millbrae as well, on Rollins Road, adjacent to US Highway 101. The students began to affectionately call this campus \\"Rollins\\", after the road it was located on. The main area of the building was the \\"Hangar\\"; a large, open, concrete-floored space. Classrooms in the Hangar were fluid; while some students often complained about distracting noise during their classes, as there were no walls or doors to stop sound or people from entering classrooms, other students felt that there was a special sense of community in this open space that brought them all closer together and could not be replicated in another way. The Rollins Road campus included the school's first iteration of the Design Realization Garage which students used to build projects such as wheelchair accessible ramps, skateboard racks, and a hexagonal bench that was eventually used as seating for meetings and snack breaks. Despite the limited space of the campus and it's lack of school- related uses, students were quick to use the often empty parking lot for basketball, football, and other physical activities. Oracle Soon after d.tech's move to Rollins, the Oracle Education Foundation announced plans to build a $43 million campus for d.tech on an unused plot of land adjacent to the Belmont Slough. They agreed to lease the building to d.tech for $1 per year, symbolic of the goal of having a strong relationship with the school. The building was designed to make space for a large, two-story, 20,000 square foot Design Realization Garage, or DRG, where students could work on projects during free time. During the first year on campus, students moved to increase happiness on campus by installing multiple vending machines with healthy snacks. This project by students spanned over the course of almost 3 years, with eventual support from staff after sorting out minor details.  Awards and recognition  The current Design Tech High School campus building at Oracle has won multiple awards such as the Green Building Award from Sustainable San Mateo County https://news.theregistrysf.com/d-tech-wins-ssmc- and-aia-smc-green-building-award/ and Best Education Project from both Silicon Valley Business Journal and PCBS as a part of their 2018 Gold Nugget Awards.https://www.integralgroup.com/news/dtech-gold-nugget/ The school is WASC accredited.https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/09/21/design- tech-high-school-is-our-educational-project.html  Athletics  Design Tech offers students the chance to create sports teams based on interest. The first sport introduced to the school was Basketball during the school's inaugural year. The men's team completed a disappointing first year without accomplishing a victory, but have since become more successful, competing for a playoff spot in the Private School: North League as recently as 2018. Since the inaugural year, the school has expanded to 6 sports for both Boys and Girls consisting of girls volleyball, cross country, basketball, soccer, boys baseball, girls softball, swimming, track, and sailing. In the 2019‚Äì2020 school year, girls volleyball, cross country, and boys basketball have qualified for CCS playoffs.  Admissions  Design Tech applicants are admitted to the school based on a lottery system, per California law. The lottery gives preference to siblings and to students in the San Mateo and Sequoia High School districts. There are more applicants than there are spaces available, and the school has moved to offer tours only after admission has been granted due to the large number of applicants.https://www.designtechhighschool.org/register-1  Executive directors  *2014‚Äìpresent: Ken Montgomery  Enrollment  {| style=\\"text-align:center;font-size:85%;\\" |+ style=\\"font-size:125%;\\" Design Tech High School Enrollment Statistics |- !

Description  Life restorations of known individuals Lavocatisaurus was a medium-sized sauropod, and one of the only known dinosaurs from the Rayoso Formation. It is known from almost all of its anatomical elements, and it is known from a few specimens including juveniles and an adult. The adult specimen is currently under preparation, and thus the described fossils come from a number of juvenile individuals. The skull was elongate and similar in shape to that of Diplodocus. The skull is well preserved for the most part, and it provides further evidence that some sauropods may have had a beak-like keratinous sheath covering the anterior of the snout.

This programming language is somewhat similar to C and C++. This language is specific to DOORS, and it has its own syntax, declaration, a forum to discuss the development, in addition to the specific reference manuals. DXL scripts were utilized to help the users of DOORS. Much of the native DOORS GUI is written in DXL. DXL is used in the client-server based \\"DOORS Classic\\"; it is not used in the newer web-based \\"DOORS Next Generation\\".  Usage of DXL  There are several of ways to use the DXL in the Rational DOORS. # \\"Editor DXL\\" is DXL typed into the DXL Editor window and run from there. It may or may not also be saved in some file. This DXL typically has some user interface, if only print statements. # \\"Menu DXL\\" is stored in Files and appear in DOORS windows, either the Explorer or open Module. The files must be of type , the files and the housing folders must be set up to display DOORS menus. It is otherwise like DXL Editor DXL. # \\"Attribute DXL\\" is stored in an Attribute Definition and saved in a Module. It has the context of a single object. When the object-attr-value is retrieved (including being displayed) the code runs and calculates the value for that object. Calculated values are not saved in the module. Attr-DXL should be written to run without user interface and complete without any pauses. # \\"Layout DXL\\" is defined in a Column and saved in a module's View. It runs for an object when that object's layout column is displayed in the GUI. It is otherwise similar to Attr-DXL. Layout DXL can be generated by the traceability Wizard, and can be converted to Attr-DXL. . # \\"Batch DXL\\" is stored in files. It runs when DOORS is run in (background) batch mode as either \\"Batch\\", \\"DXL\\", or \\"CLE\\" code defined in the batch process's command line. Since Batch mode as no GUI loaded, so DXL running in batch has some restrictions on what can run or how it is run, certainly it can have no GUI. # \\"Trigger DXL\\" is defined in a \\"Trigger\\" and stored either in a Module, a Project, or in the Database root. There is no native interface for Triggers; a file-based DXL is needed to create or delete the Trigger. When the Trigger's specified Event occurs (such as Opening a Module) any Triggers associated with that event run in order of priority. There are some restrictions on what can run inside a Trigger, but it can and often does have some Interface (typically asking the user to proceed or not). \\"Post\\" event trigger run after the event; \\"Pre\\" event triggers run before the event and can prevent the event from happening. The most common types of events are opening/closing a module, selecting a new object, or saving an object-attr value. Dynamic triggers are not stored and exist only while DOORS is running on the client computer. A typical dynamic trigger would be a post-module-close trigger that will close a GUI (such as a \\"print\\" dialog) associated with that module. A common mistake made while learning Triggers is to define a pre-module-close trigger that always prevents the module from closing. # \\"Eval DXL\\" is invoked from other DXL and runs in its own context. It is generally reserved for nuanced advanced DXL. \\"Top Eval\\" code gets deployed in the \\"top context\\" and applies to all future DXL until DOORS closes.  DXL script extensions  DXL scripts are usually stored with extension of \\".dxl\\", however they do use the library files with extension \\".inc\\".  \\"Hello, world\\" example  To print the \\"Hello, World\\", the following code will be used, print \\"Hello, World\\"  DXL editors  Sodius DXL Editor,Sodius DXL Editor built on top of Eclipse, is one tool which provides option to edit, browse, compile, execute, and debug DXL scripts. There are many open source and free editors like Notepad++ and jEdit that support DXL by custom properties.DXL Editors  References   External links * Introduction to IBM Rational DOORS eXtension Language (DXL).

University of Florida encourages UFHSA to preserve and interpret state owned properties in St. Augustine that will in turn satisfy and support state needs of professionals in historic preservation, archaeology, cultural resources management, cultural tourism, history, and museum administration. UFHSA also seeks to meet the needs of locals in the state of Florida and in the city of St. Augustine, supporting educational internships and practicums.  History  The ground work that led to UFHSA began in 2007 with the enactment of Chapter 267.1735 F.S. This Florida statute outlined goals, contracts, and duties for historic preservation professionals in St. Augustine. The University of Florida assumed management responsibilities for some historic properties downtown. In 2009, UF developed a strategic plan that laid foundations for property use, visitor experience, interpretive exhibits, educational programming, and collaborative planning with the City of St. Augustine. In 2010, UF received additional funding to upkeep and manage these historic properties from the State of Florida through recurring Plant Operation and Maintenance (PO&M;) funds. To oversee the earlier strategic plan, University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc. was formed in December 2010 and is a Direct Support Organization (DSO).  Present Day  UFHSA currently operates the website http://staugustine.ufl.edu/index.html. The organization partners with City of St. Augustine, St. Johns County, the St. Augustine Historical Society, Flagler College, the Visitors and Convention Bureau, the Castillo de San Marcos, and the Colonial Quarter.

She is currently Professor of Geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She is best-known for her research of the terrestrial carbon cycle and is an advocate for underrepresented groups in the sciences, specifically women.  Early life and education  Mar√≠n-Spiotta grew up in Spain. She became interested in her area of study and spending time outside with her family, visiting archeological sites. In 1997, she graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in Biology with a Minor in Political Science.Mar√≠n-Spiotta, Erika. \\"Erika Mar√≠n-Spiotta Curriculum Vitae\\". marinspiotta.wordpress.com/people. Retrieved 2018-11-08. Nine years later, Mar√≠n-Spiotta completed her Ph.D. of Ecosystem Science from University of California, Berkeley. Her thesis, ‚ÄúControls on above and belowground carbon storage during tropical reforestation,‚Äù contributed to her field as it discussed how changes in land use affect carbon sequestration in soil and how the establishment of secondary forests can contribute to biodiversity conservation. During her time at UC- Berkeley, she was a Graduate Research Environmental Fellow for the Department of Energy.  Career  After working as a NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Geography at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Mar√≠n-Spiotta joined the faculty at UW-Madison in 2009 as an Assistant Professor in Geography. In the following years, she also became an affiliate of the Latin American, Caribbean, and Iberian Studies Program and Center for Culture, History, and the Environment, the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies, and the Departments of Soil Science and Forest and Wildlife Ecology. Mar√≠n-Spiotta was promoted to Associate Professor in 2015 and to Professor in 2019 in the Department of Geography. In 2019, Marin-Spiotta was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists & Engineers (PECASE).  Research  Mar√≠n-Spiotta focuses on the ways in which both human-caused land use and climate changes affect biodiversity, biomass, and the biogeochemistry of the atmosphere, water, and soil, in particular as related to terrestrial carbon cycling. Her research offers insight into a variety of fields and the intersections between them, including soil science, biogeochemistry, ecosystem ecology, and geography. Specifically, much of her research looks at these impacts in tropical ecosystems and the strength and ability of forests in different stages of succession to store and sequester carbon. More recently, Mar√≠n-Spiotta has conducted research about paleosols and how the carbon stored in these soils could be a potential driver of climate change in the future. Following this research, Mar√≠n-Spiotta and her colleague were awarded a National Science Foundation grant to continue investigating the role of deep soil carbon in the carbon cycle. Currently, Mar√≠n-Spiotta‚Äôs lab researches a variety of projects across a range of questions focused on how global change is altering ecosystems and critical global elemental cycles.

Description  The Pwllpriddog Oak is known in Welsh as Derwen Pwllpriddog, and an alternative English name is the Rhandirmwyn Oak. It is sited in a farm hedgerow by a country lane outside of Rhandirmwyn in Carmarthenshire, Wales. The tree is described as a giant, being some in girth, and is completely hollow. The pub in Rhandirmwyn is named the \\"Royal Oak\\": there is possibly a connection to a local legend about the tree serving as a hiding place for a king. The hollow inside the tree has been used by farmers in the past as a pig sty ‚Äì the current farmer uses its branches as a roost and nesting place for ducks. Bands and choirs have used the tree as a performance venue, and it is thought to be the only tree in Wales to have had live music performed inside of it.

Born in Glasgow, he began his career with Welsh side Cardiff City where he signed at the age of fifteen. He made his professional debut two years later and went on to make more than 20 appearances for the club before being allowed to join Crystal Palace in 1967. However, he never played a first team game for Palace and departed the club a year later. He moved into non- league football with Margate. In seven years at the club, he made 395 appearances in all competitions and was named their player of the year for the 1972‚Äì73 season. He left Margate in 1974 and, after a brief spell with Dover, he returned to Wales where he joined Pontardawe Athletic. He succeeded Ivor Allchurch as player-manager in 1978 but left after a single season and finished his playing career with BP Llandarcy. Although primarily a wing half in his professional career, he played in numerous positions during his non- league career, including as a central defender and a forward. Career Football League Houston began his career with Cardiff City, joining the club at the age of fifteen in 1963 alongside Dai Yorath. Cardiff manager Jimmy Scoular had brought several Scottish junior players to the club, handing Houston his professional debut on 23 October 1965 in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers at the age of seventeen. Including his debut he played in ten consecutive league matches in the Second Division in place of Gareth Williams. However, when Williams returned to his usual role, Houston struggled to maintain his place and played in seven further league matches during the 1965‚Äì66 season. The following season, he made only a single appearance during a 1‚Äì1 draw with Derby County. He left the club in 1967 to sign for Crystal Palace, where his friend Yorath had moved several months earlier. However, despite playing regularly at reserve team level, Houston never appeared for Palace's first team. Margate After leaving Palace, Houston was offered a deal with Romford but rejected the offer in order to sign for Margate in January 1938. For the third time in his career, his friend Dai Yorath also made the same move. He made his debut for the club in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Cheltenham Town in the Southern Football League and scored his first goal a month later, during a 3‚Äì1 victory over Weymouth. In his first season at the club, he made 40 appearances in all competitions, scoring five times, and helped the side win the Southern Football League Cup after beating Ramsgate. Having drawn 1‚Äì1 and 0‚Äì0 in the two legs of the final, the tie went to a replay which Margate won 3‚Äì1. The following season, Houston made 61 appearances in all competitions and was used as a forward for a large part of the campaign. In his first appearance in the position, he scored a brace during a 4‚Äì4 draw with Nuneaton Borough in October 1968. A month later, Margate played a benefit match for manager Almer Hall against West Ham United. The match ended in a 6‚Äì6 draw with Houston scoring five of his side's goals. His performance prompted West Ham to scout Houston during the season although no transfer ever materialised. He scored in the club's following fixture, against Northampton Town in the first round of the FA Cup and, later in the season, scored in the final of the Kent Floodlight Cup as Margate defeated Maidstone 4‚Äì2 on aggregate. In Margate's following two seasons, Houston made over 130 appearances in all competitions and played as a defender, midfielder, winger and a forward. He would later settle into a central defensive role and, during the 1972‚Äì73 season he played in Margate's run to the third round of the FA Cup for only the second time in their history. After advancing past Dagenham and Walton & Hersham in the opening rounds, they were drawn against Tottenham Hotspur but suffered a 6‚Äì0 defeat. The 1972‚Äì73 season also saw Houston named the club's player of the year, with manager Les Riggs describing Houston as \\"a credit to the club.\\" However, the following season, he fell out of favour midway through the campaign and appeared largely as a substitute after the Christmas period. Having made 395 appearances during his seven year spell with the club, he was released at the end of the 1973‚Äì74 season. Later years Following his release, Houston signed for Dover but a promotion in his day job led to him relocating his family to South Wales and subsequently departing the club after a month. He initially remained away from football after moving but eventually joined Pontardawe Athletic who were managed by his former Cardiff teammate Ivor Allchurch. Houston played three seasons under Allchurch before succeeding him as player-manager when he decided to step down. However, Houston left the position after a single season. He moved on to BP Llandarcy where he played until 1986, including a brief spell as player-manager in 1985. He retires from football at the age of 37. Personal life After leaving professional football in 1968, Houston worked in several jobs alongside his playing career. He was employed as a civil servant in London before moving to Canterbury. In 1971, he transferred to work at Margate County Court. In later life, he worked as a clerk for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea and lived in Bryncoch. He married his partner Ann, who was from the Cardiff area, in 1971 and the pair had two children together, Craig and Leah.

The region experienced complicated tectonics during the Paleozoic, long-running shallow water conditions and then renewed uplift and erosion in the past several million years ago. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Medium- and high-grade metamorphic rocks form the basement of Thailand and geologists have debated based on radiometric dating whether metamorphism took place during the Precambrian or Mesozoic (if during the Mesozoic, it likely overprinted and recrystallized older rocks). In the northwest, many rocks near Chiang Mai and Kanchanaburi are metamorphosed to amphibolite or epidote grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. The region has a paragneiss-schist and anatectic-migmatic sequence. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) Early Paleozoic rocks are only known in western Thailand, such as sandstones on Tarutao Island in the Andaman Sea with Cambrian and Ordovician trilobite fossils. Together with non-fossil bearing strata on the mainland, they make up the Tarutao Group. Primarily sandstones, some make direct contact visible at the surface with underlying gneiss. Limestone commonly deposited in the Ordovician and Silurian, forming the Thung Song Group, with a large component of argillite in the upper and lower part of the group. There is also a shale horizon called the Ban Na Shale, interbedded with Ordovician limestone. The presence of shale suggests a deeper water environment in the Silurian. The Thong Pha Phum Group conformably overlies the Thung Song Group in the west with a thick sequence of non-fossil bearing clastic marine sedimentary rocks that likely deposited in a forearc basin. Volcanic activity was common in the Devonian and Carboniferous as limestone accumulated on a western facing continental margin (exposures of these rocks are visible at Petchabun-Loei in east-central Thailand). Carboniferous and Permian turbidite sequences overlie these groups in south, west and central Thailand. Thick sequences of clastic sediment in the Kaeng Krachan Formation extends from the center-west into Myanmar. Some geologists have interpreted pebbly diamictite mudstone and turbidites in the Mergui Group as glacial sediments, with possible origin in India or northwest Australia. One interpretation holds that the Mergui Group was thrust on top of the Shan-Thai Block from the west during the Mesozoic, forming a nappe. Extensional tectonics in the north led to mafic volcanic activity within the Shan-Thai Block in the Carboniferous, continuing into the Permian. Some red beds also formed during the same period. During the Permian, almost the entire region was submerged during a major marine transgression. Carbonates deposited in shallow, shelf seas and today form dramatic karst landscapes. The warm water Saraburi Group in the east has numerous fossils, while the Ratburi Group in the west does not. In peninsular Thailand, sandstone is predominant interfingered with Ratburi Group limestones. Along the western edge of the Khorat Plateau, a limestone dominated shelf sequence abuts turbidites and pyroclastic flow deposits. A magmatic arc around a west-dipping subduction zone produced intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks in the north around Lampang to the east of Chiang Mai. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) During the Triassic, a major marine transgression flooded Thailand. Conglomerate is common at the base of units from this time period, overlain by limestone that thickens to the westward. East of Chiang Mai, the Lampang Group has marine shale, sandstone, limestone and conglomerate three kilometers thick, overlain by an additional two kilometers of flysch. Geologists have interpreted it as shallow-water deposition in a forearc basin over a west- dipping subduction zone. Marine conditions lasted into the Norian, or as late as the Jurassic in the west. The Mae Moei Group is a major limestone unit in the northwest equivalent to the Lampang Group with Jurassic strata at the top and overlain by Cretaceous red beds. By contrast to the patterns of marine deposition, the Khorat Plateau in the northeast is underlain by Triassic- Cretaceous continental deposits. Offshore islands and the Cambodian border have numerous sandstones related to the plateau. With calc-alkaline volcanic rock at its base, the Khorat Plateau is diachronous giving the appearance that basin deposition moved further west through the Mesozoic. The Khorat Group is five kilometers thick in the northeast and holds occasional dinosaur, plant and bivalve fossils. Much of the deposition took place in a lake environment. The Khorat Group begins with 2.5 kilometers of red beds, overlain by light- colored sandstones, red beds and evaporites such as carallite, tachyhydrite, halite and sylvite. The carnallite zone is up to 95 meters thick and the halite deposit is one of the thickest on Earth. Thailand has intrusive granitoid everywhere but the Khorat Plateau. I- and S-type plutons are dominant along the border with Myanmar and extending to the Phuket Island. Typically, they are small and isolated with biotite and muscovite-rich granite as well as potassium feldspar megacrysts, hornblende and large mica-tourmaline or lepidolite pegmatites. S-type granites in this belt commonly have tin- tungsten mineralization. Triassic S-type granitoid batholiths, often associated with orthogneiss and migmatite, form a central belt in western Thailand the peninsula. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) Cenozoic sedimentary rocks are mainly found in low-lying areas in the north and west, but also at several areas in the south. In the north, graben formations filled with sediment two kilometers thick. For much of the Cenozoic, Thailand was comparatively flat until rapid uplift began in the north, accompanied by block faulting and horst and graben formation in the Pliocene and Pleistocene, leaving valley floors to fill with gravel and sand. Large quantities of natural gas and some petroleum have been found in the blended terrestrial and marine sedimentary strata along the Andaman Sea coast, ranging in age from Oligocene to Pliocene. Marine influence is modest and common later in the sequence, which is up to eight kilometers thick. The Chao Paya Basin around Bangkok and Pitsanulok Basin in the north both have extensive Quaternary sedimentary cover from the last 2.5 million years. Based on aerial magnetic surveys and boreholes, geologists have inferred that the Chao Paya Basin is believed to be a composite graben with uneven underlying topography. Throughout the Quaternary, as uplift continued sediments eroded off the rising highlands and deposited in low-lying areas. During the Pleistocene ice ages, the Gulf of Thailand resembled its present geography, although sea levels did rise and extend more than 100 kilometers north of Bangkok, leaving behind the 20 meter thick Bangkok Clay in the Holocene. An alkaline basalt province erupted across northern Thailand and into Cambodia and Vietnam, leaving behind small vents, plugs and flows. Natural resource geology Thailand is a leading global producer of tin, almost exclusively from cassiterite. In a few locations, very small occurrences of malayaite and stannite‚Äîother examples of tin minerals‚Äîhave been found. Cassiterite is found in quartz veins, skarn deposits, aplite, pegmatite and greisenized granite intrusions, often with accessory minerals such as fluorite, muscovite, wolframite, columbite, tantalite, tourmaline, topaz, zircon and beryl. Sulfide minerals like chalcopyrite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, galena and bismuthinite are found in association with cassiterite in the north and south. Virtually all deposits display some form of hydrothermal formation. In the west and along the Malaysian border are tin-bearing granites. In fact, the Ranong-Phuket area near the Andaman Sea coast and the southern peninsula of Thailand produces 85 percent of its tin output. Onshore and offshore placer deposits are the key tin source. Additionally, Thailand has some production of gypsum, limestone, kaolin, sapphire, zircon, tantalite, columbite, antimony, lead, zinc, barite and fluorite. Examples include Jurassic sandstones with copper-uranium mineralization or Ordovician limestones with lead-zinc sulfides. Onshore and offshore Cenozoic basins have lignite, oil shale and some petroleum.

Marasmius querceus) is one of the garlic-scented mushrooms formerly in the genus Marasmius. It has a reddish brown stipe, and usually grows on fallen oak leaves. Description The species can be described as follows: *The cap is reddish brown to pale brown, and is hygrophanous, drying to a paler colour. It measures around 1-2.5 cm in diameter. *The gills are white to cream and crowded. The spore powder is white. *The brownish stem can grow to 10 cm tall and up to 4 mm in diameter. It is powdery (\\"pruinose\\") or covered in minute hairs (\\"pubescent\\"), a feature which distinguishes it from M. scorodonius. *The smell is strongly of garlic. *The spores are roughly ellipsoid and measure 7-10 ¬µm x 4-5 ¬µm. *There are no cheilocystidia (on the gill edge) or pleurocystidia (on the gill faces). Naming and related species The Latin species name, querceus, means \\"relating to oak\\", and refers to its being found commonly on oak leaf litter. This species was originally defined as Marasmius querceus by the German mycologist Max Britzelmayr in 1896 and it had that name until it was put into the new genus Mycetinis in 2005 (see the Mycetinis page for more details). The name Marasmius prasiosmus (following Fries) has wrongly been used for this mushroom by some authors, but this is an illegitimate synonym because there is a conflict between Fries's description of 1838 (which does represent M. querceus) and his original description of 1818 and 1821 (which represents some other mushroom). The pruinose or pubescent reddish brown stipe, together with its habitat on deciduous leaf litter are enough to distinguish it from other European species of Mycetinis. Ecology and distribution This mushroom is found in autumn on fallen deciduous leaves, especially those of various types of Quercus. It is uncommon but widespread in Europe, and recorded from North Africa.

This is approximately , by road, southeast of Narok, where the county headquarters are located. Overview CYRQ Energy, a United States-based energy and technology company, has carried out feasibility studies for a geothermal power station at the project site. The results of those studies support the development of an economically viable power station, with capacity of 330 megawatts. The power station, to be developed in phases, will start with capacity of 75 megawatts. subsequent phases will raise output to 330 megawatts. The energy from this power station is expected to be sold to Kenya Power and Lighting Company, under a 25 year power purchase agreement. Timetable and funding As of October 2018, the station owner/developers have submitted requests to install the power station at the development site. When those requests are approved, construction of the first phase is expected to follow and take an estimated three to four years. Later phases of the development would then follow. The entire development is estimated to cost KSh30 billion (US$300 million), financed through equity and debt.

Discovery of the body  On Friday 11 October 1991, Colin Oliver, then 62, discovered the torso in woods off Broxmead Lane in Bolney, Sussex. Oliver was walking home to Burgess Hill from Cuckfield along Broxfield Lane. He stopped along the lane and went through a gate leading to a field. He went into the trees to urinate and found a bloody torso rolled up in a piece of carpet in undergrowth. Oliver then walked to the Burgess Hill police station to alert the police to his discovery. He claimed to have been so disturbed by the discovery that he had trouble sleeping for several months afterwards.  Initial description of the victim  The remains were found to be of a male who was believed to have been in his 60s at the time of death. The head and hands of the victim had been removed and the severed head and limbs were never found. One arm had been severed six inches below the elbow and the other two inches below the elbow; this appeared to have been done in order to remove an identifying tattoo. The arms and head appeared to have been removed with an axe or bolt cropper. The victim was described as white, had a protruding belly, was circumcised and had a small star-shaped mole on his right thigh. The victim was wearing turned up trousers from Fosters and a blue shirt with a distinctive motif on the pocket.  Investigation  The investigation to find the identity of the victim and the murderer was assigned the name Operation A23, employing 60 people and costing ¬£150,000. DCI Peter Kennett led the initial inquiry. Detectives searched files of over 100 missing men without finding a match and appeals for the public to come forward with an identity were fruitless.  Suspects  In December 1991, police were contacted by a local estate agent with a potential lead; a large rented house in Copyhold Lane, Cuckfield, (1.5 miles from the deposition location of the body) had been abandoned which raised their suspicions. Police investigated the property and found a copy of Penthouse magazine containing an article about dismembering bodies with numbers scrawled on the pages. Gunter Josef Knieper, from Dresden, Germany, and Kornelia Maria Teusel first rented the property in September 1991 paying ¬£10,000 (6 months rent) in advance. The couple abandoned the property some time around 9 October 1991. Knieper, who had been using the pseudonym Dr Matthias Herrman, was being sought in Germany and Ireland on suspicion of business fraud. In June 1992, Knieper was arrested in Spain. Police interviewed Knieper in Frankfurt and established that the gang intended to start a fraud operation but Knieper denied any involvement in the murder of the victim. In August 1992, police admitted there was no evidence to link Knieper to the murder. In January 1994, police returned to Germany to interview another unnamed male who had visited the property in Copyhold Lane.  Burial  On 2 August 1994, after a brief service, the remains of the victim were laid to rest at Western Road Cemetery, in Haywards Heath. The coffin bore the name \\"Unknown Male\\" Eight people attended the paupers funeral paid for by Mid Sussex District Council. The mourners in attendance were representatives of the police, coroner's office and Mid Sussex District Council.  Subsequent events  In December 1995, a few days before Christmas, some flowers and a note were left at the victim's grave. The note bore the message: \\"For the unknown male, Peter and team, remember our loss [sic].\\"  Re-investigation  In March 2009, police exhumed the body in the hope that advances in forensic techniques would provide additional information. On 12 November 2009, the case appeared on the BBC program Crimewatch. In 2010 it was reported that, following media appeals on Crimewatch UK and its German equivalent, numerous suggestions for the victim's identity had been received; however, none bore fruit. Police stated that three missing persons had been discounted as the identity of the victim and their families had been informed. In 2011, it was revealed that evidence gathered in 2010 indicated that the victim had been dressed post mortem and that the clothes did not belong to the victim. The re-investigation examined a femur, rib bone and toenail from the victim. This revealed that the victim likely came from Southern Germany or a surrounding country. Analysis of the toenail suggested that the victim spent the last year of his life in the UK or the French/German border.  Revised description of the victim  The revised description of the victim was that his height was between 5 ft 6 and 5 ft 8 tall, aged between 30 and 45 and most likely in his late 30s at the time of death. The victim had a strongly built upper body. Analysis of the skeleton indicated that the victim was strong, well-nourished and healthy at the time of his death and had no signs of any degenerative illness.

A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times is the title of the collection of satirical poems published on June 12, 1915 by suffragist Alice Duer Miller. Many of the poems in this collection were originally released individually in the New York Tribune. This collection mainly contains satirical works and poetry designed to promote the suffrage movement. Her collection was broke down into five sections: the Treacherous Texts, Campaign Material, Women's Sphere, A Masque of Teachers, and The Unconscious Suffragists. Each section varied in the style of writing employed by Miller from poetry, to prose, to lists, to a short play, but all of the writings promoted feminist and suffragist themes and ideals. Title Page: Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times by Alice Duer Miller. Published by George H. Doran Company, New York, 1915 Summary and Themes The Treacherous Texts The first section, the Treacherous Texts, contains satirical poetry that was written in direct response to a quote often from a public official that openly expressed anti-feminist and anti-suffragist ideals. Her poems in this section varied from satirical and comical to biting and harsh critiques of the quotes to which she was responding. She included these quotes above each poem for this section. One prime example of her use of this format was in her poem Representation, wherein which Miller writes in response to a quote by Vice President Marshall: > Representation (\\"My wife is against suffrage, and that settles me.\\"‚ÄîVice- > President Marshall.) I My wife dislikes the income tax, And so I cannot pay > it; She thinks that golf all interest lacks, So now I never play it; She is > opposed to tolls repeal (Though why I cannot say), But woman's duty is to > feel, And man's is to obey. II I'm in a hard position for a perfect > gentleman, I want to please the ladies, but I don't see how I can, My > present wife's a suffragist, and counts on my support, But my mother is an > anti, of a rather biting sort; One grandmother is on the fence, the other > much opposed, And my sister lives in Oregon, and thinks the question's > closed; Each one is counting on my vote to represent her view. Now what > should you think proper for a gentleman to do?  Campaign Material (For Both Sides) This section of the collection mainly contains lists and short timelines relating to suffrage themes. Many of these lists are sarcastic and critical examinations of the anti-suffrage and anti-feminist perspectives. One such list, Why We Oppose Pockets for Women, satirically examines the equal right of women to have pockets as a clear critique of those who pose similar arguments against women's suffrage: > Why We Oppose Pockets for Women 1\\\\. Because pockets are not a natural right. > 2\\\\. Because the great majority of women do not want pockets. If they did > they would have them. 3\\\\. Because whenever women have had pockets they have > not used them. 4\\\\. Because women are required to carry enough things as it > is, without the additional burden of pockets. 5\\\\. Because it would make > dissension between husband and wife as to whose pockets were to be filled. > 6\\\\. Because it would destroy man's chivalry toward woman, if he did not have > to carry all her things in his pockets. 7\\\\. Because men are men, and women > are women. We must not fly in the face of nature. 8\\\\. Because pockets have > been used by men to carry tobacco, pipes, whiskey flasks, chewing gum and > compromising letters. We see no reason to suppose that women would use them > more wisely.  Women's Sphere  This section of the collection contains more of Miller's short poems. These satirical poems directly address issues of feminism, the double standards that women face and the need for equality for women. This collection of poems differs from that of The Treacherous Texts because unlike in the first section, most of the poems in this collection are not directly in response to and referencing a specific quote. One such work that exemplifies the kinds of satirical feminist writings typical of this section is A Sex Difference: > A Sex Difference When men in Congress come to blows at something someone > said, I always notice that it shows their blood is quick and red; But if two > women disagree, with very little noise, It proves, and this seems strange to > me, that women have no poise.  A Masque of Teachers  This section contains only one work called The Ideal Candidates. This work is a short one-act play written in verse. The work is set up as a conversation between three candidates to become teachers and the board of education. Each candidate needs to prove to the board of directors that their husband is either unfit to work, or that they were left by their husband in order to be given a teaching position. This was written in response to a by-law of the New York Board of Education. At the beginning of the piece Miller directly addressed the motivation for this satirical work by including: > \\"A by-law of the New York Board of Education says: 'No married woman shall > be appointed to any teaching or supervising position in the New York public > schools unless her husband is mentally or physically incapacitated to earn a > living or has deserted her for a period of not less than one year.'\\"  The Unconscious Suffragists  This final section contains quotes from many important male political leaders in the United States. All of the quotes collected in this section, whether or not it was the intention of the author, are arguing in favor of suffrage and equality for women.  Release and Publication  These poems were originally released individually in the New York Tribune, and were later published as a collection by the George H. Doran company in 1915. In the introduction to this collection, Miller included the dedication: > \\"To the New York Tribune, in whose generous columns many of these verses > first appeared, the author here wishes to express her gratitude.\\" Her column in the New York Tribune ran from February 1914 to November 1917. Reception This collection was positive in its initial critical reception. It appeared in the New York Time's list of \\"IMPORTANT NEW BOOKS FOR JUNE; Publications in Various Fields of Literature to Fill Demands for Summer Reading,\\" published on June 6th 1915.

The rules vary slightly from region to region, but the basic game in each variation is identical. It is one of the Rams group of card games characterised by allowing players to drop out of the current game if they think they will be unable to win any tricks or a minimum number of tricks.Card Games: Rams Group at www.pagat.com. Retrieved 16 Oct 2018Geiser, Remigius (2004). \\"100 Kartenspiele des Landes Salzburg\\", in Talon, Issue 13, p. 38.  History  In many ways, Lupfen resembles the game of Tippen which was already well known in the 19th century and is described in Meyers Lexikon von 1905 as follows: Tippen (Dreiblatt, Zwicken), a gambling game of cards that is very widely played in Germany. It is played by 3‚Äì6 people with 32 cards or, with more participants, with 52 cards. The dealer pays three chips (Marken) as the initial stake (Stamm), deals each player 3 cards, one at a time, and turns the next for trumps. If only the Stamm is available, all the players must play (mitgehen), and anyone who fails to take a trick pays a b√™te (the amount in the pot). Once the pot includes a b√™te, any player who does not think he can win a trick, may pass (\\"passen\\"); a player, however, with good cards, may say: \\"I'll go with you\\" (\\"Ich gehe mit\\") or taps (tippt) his finger on the table. For each trick taken, a player receives one third of the existing pool. Players must follow suit or trump. www.zeno.org The main differences are that Tippen is played with 32 cards and no special combinations, whereas Lupfen is played with just 20 cards and certain card combinations come into play. Today, Lupfen is mainly played in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg and in the southern German region of the Allg√§u, usually for small monetary stakes. The first international Lupfen competition was held √ñflingen in the south German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in 1974.Schnitzelbank 1974 at www.sumpfer.de. Retrieved 30 Oct 2018. It is also played by students in Liechtenstein.Lupfen at www.pagat.com. Retrieved 9 Nov 2018  Rules  Lupfen is normally played by three to six players with a pack of Salzburg or Bavarian pattern cards with the suits of Acorns (Eichel), Leaves (Schippen), Hearts (Herz) and Bells (Schellen). In Liechtenstein it is played with Swiss- suited cards with the suits: Acorns, Roses, Shields and Bells. Only the Sow (Deuce),Commonly, but erroneously, called an Ace and often even marked with an \\"A\\". 10 or Banner, King, Ober and Unter are used, the cards ranking in that order, making 20 cards in all. The cards are shuffled and each player is dealt 3 cards clockwise, in turn, and one at a time. Depending on the contents of the pott (i.e. \\"pot\\"), players either play a compulsory 'round' or a Lupfen round.  Force  The first deal at the beginning of the game is always a compulsory round or 'force' (Pflichtrunde). In addition, a force is played whenever the pott has been exhausted. In a force, all the players must participate; they are not allowed to drop out if they have a weak hand. Each player pays a previously agreed ante into the pott - a container placed in the middle of the table. The top card of the remaining stock is turned over and determines the trump suit. The player to the left of the dealer makes the opening lead (kommt heraus). Players must follow suit or, if they have no card in the led suit, must play a trump. If they have no trumps either, they usually plays their lowest card because it is not possible to win a trick without following suit or trumping. Once the force has been played out, the tricks are reckoned. A player who has taken no tricks has to pay the contents of the pot (paying the money to the pot after the winnings have been distributed). If each player has taken a trick (only possible with 3 players), another force is played. Force deals are repeated until at least one player fails to take any tricks.  Lupfen  In a Lupfen round, the top card of the stock is not turned for trumps immediately after the cards have been dealt. Instead, players decide, in clockwise order, whether to turn the top card, indicating they will \\"play\\" or whether to drop out of the current round by saying \\"pass\\". If a player has a good hand and believes he can win one or more tricks, he turns the top card of the stock. This is known as a lupf (\\"lift\\") from the south German verb, lupfen). The turnup decides the trump suit as normal. The remaining players now decide whether or not to take up the challenge by saying \\"play!\\" (mit!\\", literally \\"with!\\"), thereby undertaking to win at least one trick. The player who has made a lupf (gelupft), together with the other active players, now play for the pott. Players receive one third of the pott (3 cards ‚Üí 3 possible tricks) for each trick won. If an active player fails to take a trick, he must pay the contents of the pott. Players continue playing a lupfen until the pott is empty again. Example 1: \\\\- Player A has made a lupf \\\\- Players B and C decide to play. \\\\- Player A takes 1 trick, Player B takes 2 tricks, Player C takes none. ‚Üí Player A receives 1 third of the pott, Player B receives 2 thirds and Player C has to pay the contents of the pott (the total in the pott thus stays the same) Example 2: \\\\- Player B has made a lupf and takes all 3 tricks \\\\- Players A and C both fail to take any tricks ‚Üí Player B receives the whole pott, Players A and C each play (!) the content of the pott (the pott has now been doubled) This is repeated until the pott has been completed divided out (i. e. each participant in the deal has taken a trick or a player has made a lupf, but everyone else has passed). Players may agree beforehand how or when a session ends.  Special card combinations  A distinguishing feature of Lupfen is its special card combinations:  3 Unters  If a player has 3 Unters in his hand, he has automatically won once a game is on. In a compulsory round, he declares \\"three Unters\\" whereupon all the others must pay the pott. In a Lupfen, he does not reveal his hand, but waits to see which of the others will \\"play\\". Once the announcements have been made, the 3 Unters are declared and every other player who opted to \\"play\\" has to pay the pott because 3 Unters cannot be beaten.  Scrap  If a player has 2 Unters and 1 Ober - i.e. the weakest possible hand - he may end the deal early by calling \\"scrap!\\" (Verworfen). In a compulsory round, the cards are reshuffled and dealt again without anyone having to pay the pott. In a Lupfen, the player may wait until the game is on before scrapping. For example, a player with 2 Unters and an Ober can lupf and wait to see whether anyone plays. If no-one does, he wins the pott. If another player takes up the challenge and wants to play, he reveals his hand and declares \\"scrap!\\" and the deal starts again.  St√§nder  A St√§nder is when a player has 3 cards of the same suit in his hand (a 3-card flush). This is announced immediately on receipt of the 3rd card by 'knocking' on the table.  Variants  * Dealer stake. It may be agreed before the game that the dealer pays an additional stake to the pott before dealing. Usually the dealing fee = the basic stake. It can, however, be another amount as long as it is divisible by three. * Shoving. If there is a fee for dealing, the dealer is free to choose whether he goes ahead, shuffles and deals, or 'shoves' (schiebt) the cards to the next player after paying his fee. This can be repeated as often as desired. The pott thus increases each round by the dealing fee i.e. in the playoff round the amount at stake is all the greater. The variant with the fee for the dealer lets the pot grow faster, because it also increases if every player has made a trick in a compulsory round. * Compulsory Hearts. If trumps are Hearts, all players must play. * Compulsory Lupf. If a player has 2 Sows, he must lupf. * Blind Lupf. A player turns the Lupf card before looking at his cards. The loser then pays double the pott.  References   External links  * Lupfen as a gambling game in Bavaria. * Lupf Kartenspiel - YouTube tutorial (German). * Lupfen at www.pagat.com.

Mann's case is believed by law enforcement to be the longest case in North America, where the abducted child is reunited with a parent where they're both in safe conditions.  Abduction  Mann was allegedly kidnapped by his father, Allan Mann, on 24 June 1987, when he was 21 months old during a scheduled visit in Toronto, Canada. His parents had separated the year prior. Lyneth Mann-Lewis reported her son's disappearance to the Missing Children Society of Canada (MCSC), when he and his father failed to return. While in the United States, Mann and his father lived under counterfeit birth certificates and other documents. Through the documents, Allan Mann lived under the name \\"Hailee DeSouza\\", and claimed that he and his son were both born in Texas, and had relocated to Vernon, Connecticut. Allan Mann was discovered in Section 8 housing in Vernon, and it was revealed that Allan Mann had told Jermaine that his mother had died after giving birth to him.  Investigation  The case was investigated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the US Marshals Service, Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, the Toronto Police, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The CEO of MCSC, Amanda Pick, and Mann-Lewis both credited the work of retired police officer Ted Davis, who investigated for the MCSC. In August 2018, US Marshals interviewed several of Allan Mann's relatives and friends, who indicated that he may have settled in Connecticut. Later in the month a forensic specialist from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children analyzed and compared an old picture of Allan Mann and the 2015 drivers license from DeSouza, and found they were likely the same person.  Discovery  There is an active warrant for Allan Mann by the Canadian authorities, but extradition proceedings from the United States would not begin immediately. In the United States, Allan Mann is detained on charges which include making false statements in transactions with the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mann-Lewis gave a press statement after news broke of his discovery; \\"I am the proof that after 31 long years of suffering, one should never give up.

He played college basketball for Maryland.  Early life and high school career  Nickens attended the Westtown School near West Chester, Pennsylvania, where he was coached by Seth Berger. He was considered a four- star recruit by 247Sports.com and was ranked the 94th best prospect in his class. Nickens committed to Maryland on June 16, 2013. College career As a freshman, Nickens came off the bench on Maryland's first NCAA tournament team under coach Mark Turgeon. He scored 14 points in the first round match against Valparaiso. He averaged 6.1 points per game as a freshman, shooting 39% from behind the arc.

After the season, Nickens and teammate Jaylen Brantley popularized the dance craze \\"Running Man Challenge,\\" which became a viral sensation. The two appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. He received fewer minutes during his junior season due to the arrival of Kevin Huerter and a poor shooting start to the season. Nickens scored in double figures once, with 12 points in a victory against Michigan. Despite not playing much as a junior, Nickens hit the game- tying three-point shot which resulted in an 84-76 win against Iowa. As a senior, Nickens had an increased role due to the season-ending injury to Justin Jackson. During a five-game stretch during the middle of his senior season, Nickens endured a shooting slump in which he went 6 of 27 and 2 of 19 on three-pointers. In the next five games, he improved his shooting to 17 of 33 and 13 of 26 on three-pointers. During this improved shooting streak, Nickens scored 13 points in a 74-70 loss to Penn State on February 7, 2018. He averaged 5.1 points and 1.4 rebounds per game as a senior and shot 41.3 percent from behind the arc. Nickens did not reach the NCAA Tournament as a senior but finished his career as the eighth-most prolific three-point shooter in school history.

She was a member of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League, a communist group fighting against French rule in Vietnam. She became the first female political prisoner in Vietnam.  Early life  Nguyen Trung Nguyet grew up on her parents farm in Binh Dai. Although few girls received an education at this time, Nguyen Trung Nguyet went to an all-boys night school run by her uncle. At nine years old her family moved from Binh Dai to Rach Gia (now Kien Giang), and at age twelve, they again uprooted to Phuoc Long (now part of Bac Lieu Province). Her father, Nguyen van Nham, was a French resistor, and told her stories of anticolonial resistance. He encouraged her to write patriotic poems and question the French rule. At her age, most young Vietnamese women were expected to be married, but Nguyen Trung Nguyet did not want to be distracted from the revolution against the French. Trung Nguyet often tried to persuade her parents to let her leave home to engage in revolutionary activities, but they resisted. In the Spring of 1927, Nguyen Trung Nguyet left home for Saigon, where she stayed with her aunt, Kim Oanh and her uncle Ton Duc Thang. Around the time she left home, Nguyen Trung Nguyet adopted the name Bao Luong (‚ÄúPrecious Honesty‚Äù), which she had originally used as a pen name while writing poetry.  Activism  Her uncle, Ton Duc Thang was the leader of the southern section of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League. After four months, during which Ton Duc Thang assessed Bao Luong's interest and potential, she was recruited to join the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League. Training for the Youth League was in Guangzhou, China, and before boarding the boat, Bao Luong's family disguised her as a boy. Her true identity was discovered only after she gained the trust and loyalty of the other revolutionary activists on board. In Guangzhou, Bao and the other trainees attended lectures on revolutionary ideologies, evolution, and the socialist movement. At the training school, Bao wrote poetry and other articles for the cause. When her training was complete, she went back to her family in Phuoc Long. Her first task was to convince her family to support her efforts in the revolution, and her parents vowed to support her and keep her secret. She went on to recruit women to join the revolution. Bao Luong traveled throughout the Mekong Delta pretending to sell fabric. Along the way, she gathered women that supported the Revolutionary Youth League. Many of these women hoped that the revolution would lead to education reforms and the freedom to choose their own husbands. Bao Luong then received permission to start an all-women cell of the Revolutionary Youth League. She hosted meetings that gathered women from a wide geographical area, spanning five regions. All female meetings were unprecedented at the time, and Bao's superiors warned her to be more careful. At these meetings, the women decided to use poetry to spread the anticolonial message, and used stories of exemplary women throughout history to help make their points.  Murder on Barbier Street  Bao Luong's passionate fight against French rule led her to become involved in an assassination plot. On December 8, 1928, Le van Phat was found in his home on Barbier Street. Le van Phat was known as Lang to the members of the Revolutionary Youth League. Lang was the chairman of the Saigon Provincial regional committee of the Revolutionary Youth League. Lang was accused of forcing a younger member of his cell to become his mistress. He also began abusing power, disrespecting orders, and missing meetings. Bao Luong chaired the meeting where the decision to execute Lang's murder was made. She directed members at the meeting to draw ballots to see who would commit the murder and three men (including Bao Luong's cousin) were selected. Bao Luong drafted a love letter which was used to make sure Lang would be home at the time of the murder. Her cousin and the two other men attempted to kill Lang with poison, before slitting his throat. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Youth League was against the murder and ordered the Saigon cell to disband. This group went on to become the Communist Party of Indochina. After Bao Luong and her fellow Saigon cell members refused, an anonymous letter was sent to the Republic of Vietnam National Police, known as the Surete, that implicated Bao Luong and other league members in the murder of Lang.  Imprisonment and later life  Bao Luong was beaten in prison, as the Surete tried to get her to confess. She was then moved to the Saigon Central Prison, where she awaited trial. At her trial, she spoke out to the French judge about the poor treatment of women in French Indochina and maintained her revolutionary ideas. She was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, but her behavior in court added three more years to her sentence. The men who committed the murder were sentenced to death. Her mentor and uncle, Ton Duc Thang, served a short prison sentence before becoming the president of Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In prison, a male nurse who cared for Bao Luong fell in love with her. Through an intermediary, the nurse (Nguyen van Thom) asked her family for her hand in marriage. After being questioned by the head of the prison for his plans to marry Bao Luong upon her release, Nguyen van Thom quit. After Bao's release, the two moved to O Mon and had children. She was later encouraged to rejoin the revolution, but denied the invitation to care for her children and in-laws.

In late November 2000, just weeks before his disappearance, Deely flew to Alaska in the United States. He flew on a discount that his friend procured for him due to his role as a long-haul flight attendant, which his friend described as ‚Äòfree‚Äô. He went over to see a girl that he had met in Dublin during the summer while she was holidaying in Ireland.'. Disappearance The Christmas party was scheduled for Thursday 7 December. After drinks in Copper Face Jack's and the Hilton Hotel, the party moved to Buck Whaley's nightclub on Lower Leeson Street. Deely left Buck Whaley's about 3:25am. He started walking in the direction of his apartment in the Renoir complex, on Serpentine Avenue in Ballsbridge. There was a heavy storm that night with gusts as high as 60 or 70 mph, and there was also a taxi strike. About ten minutes after leaving the nightclub, Deely arrived at his office, and was let in after calling security. While in his office Deely made a cup of tea and spoke to a colleague, Karl Pender, who was working the night shift. He also checked his emails and made a note of things he needed to do in work the following morning. He left the office at 4:03am, taking an umbrella with him, and continued in the direction of Ballsbridge. Around this time he rang a friend of his in Naas and left a voicemail. His friend described the message as saying \\"‚ÄòHi, Glen, I‚Äôve missed you there. Just on my way home, all going good, I‚Äôll talk to you tomorrow.‚Äô Or words to that very close effect.‚Äù His friend deleted the message, not regarding it as significant and investigators never sought to retrieve it. CCTV footage shows that a man dressed in black was waiting outside the gates of the bank for approximately half an hour before Deely arrived. When Deely arrived, they had a brief conversation. Two minutes after Deely entered the bank, two more men arrived at the gate. While they have since been cleared as colleagues of Deely, the man in black remains a person of interest. By the time Deely left the bank, this man was no longer waiting outside. At 4:14am CCTV footage shows Deely walking past what was then the AIB bank on the corner of Baggot Street Bridge and Haddington Road in the direction of his flat. About thirty seconds later a man dressed in black passed by the AIB bank. Garda√≠ said that they believe this is the same man who spoke to Deely outside his office. This man has never come forward to Garda√≠, despite numerous appeals over many years since the disappearance. This footage represents the last known sighting of Deely. Investigation Deely's absence from work the following morning was not seen as a cause for concern as it had been a late night. Additionally, his flatmates were away that weekend so they did not know he was missing either. Only when Deely failed to show up the following Monday were alarm bells raised. His work informed his family. After asserting that nobody had spoken to Deely that weekend, they reported him as a missing person. Over the following days Deely's family and friends put up hundreds of posters, handed out thousands of leaflets and went from house to house and business to business inquiring if people had seen him. His friends were able to obtain the CCTV footage used in the investigation. Det. Sgt Michael Fitzgerald, who worked on the case from the beginning said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never worked on a case where the family were so proactive.‚Äù Unfortunately, the delay between Deely being last seen and reported as missing meant that vital time was lost. The Garda sub-aqua team searched the river Dodder and the Grand Canal but did not find anything. They were unable to drain the Grand Canal Basin as it would affect the structural integrity of the surrounding buildings. Deely's sister, Michele, said that she rang Trevor's phone a few times the weekend he went missing and she believes that it rang out. According to Dr. Philip Perry, a senior research fellow in the radio and optical communications laboratory at Dublin City University, a phone in 2000 would have gone dead within seconds of falling into the water. However, Michele said she is not 100% sure that it did actually ring. Two Garda√≠ travelled to Alaska to speak to the girl who Deely had gone over to see before his disappearance. Deely's sisters also travelled to Alaska separately for the same purpose. The trips did not produce any leads. Recent developments Deely's whereabouts remain unknown and the case continues to spark interest. A special documentary hosted by Donal MacIntyre aired on TV3 in 2015. In December 2016 a new investigation was opened. The following April, enhanced CCTV footage was released, leading to the announcement by Garda√≠ that they believed that the man dressed in black seen behind Deely on the Haddington Road footage was the same man that he spoke to outside his office. That same month a ‚Ç¨100,000 reward was offered for information. In August 2017, Garda√≠ began a search of a three-acre secluded area in the Dublin suburb of Chapelizod, about 8 kilometres from where Deely was last seen. An informant alleged that Deely was murdered on the night of his disappearance by a Crumlin-based criminal known to Garda√≠. The gang he was in was involved in the drugs and prostitution trade in the area where Deely disappeared. The same gang was investigated for the murder of Sinead Kelly in June 1998. The informant said that Deely and his alleged murderer had not known each other and it was a chance encounter. Although a gun and drugs were found during the search, investigators concluded that they were not related to the case, calling the site a 'stash area' for criminals. The search was called off in September and Garda√≠ said at the time that they had not found anything that would assist them in the case.

It was designed by Spain and Cosh and built in 1906-07 by Conolly and Stidwell. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Singleton District Hospital was the first permanent hospital established in this district when it was completed in 1907. Both the site and what was variously reported as most or all of the total cost of the hospital, ¬£8333 10s 5d, were donated by Albert Augustus Dangar, of the prominent Dangar family. The hospital was initially named the Dangar Cottage Hospital. Dangar also donated ¬£4156 2s 6d towards a hospital endowment. Prior to Dangar's gift, residents had been complaining that local health facilities were inadequate for several years without resolution. By 1954, it was treating an average of 41 patients daily, reaching its then-highest monthly total of 177 patients in November that year. The hospital lacked maternity facilities for many years, with births taking place at the Fairholme Maternity Hospital. The hospital name changed to the Singleton District Hospital in 1956. A maternity section opened at the hospital on 2 August 1961. A $7 million expansion and redevelopment of the hospital, including a new West Wing, formally opened in February 2018. In 2018, the hospital continues to operate from the original site, offering services including an emergency department, surgery and day surgery, obstetrics, renal dialysis, palliative care, other specialists and allied health.  Description  The hospital is a substantial two storey central building built in the Federation Arts and Crafts Style with attached shingled projecting window bays and verandah flanked on either side by single storey wings, enclosed by verandahs supported on brick and timber columns.  Heritage listing  The hospital is of architectural significance as an example of an early 20th century country hospital design in the Federation Arts and Crafts style. It is also of historical significance of an important local community building. Singleton District Hospital was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Bollea 150 Misc. 2d 925 (N.Y. Misc. 1990) is a 1990 New York Supreme Court case between TV presenter Richard Belzer and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan (whose real name is Terry Bollea). The case involved Belzer suing Hogan for personal injury after Hogan had put a sleeper hold on him. The case was eventually settled financially out of court; however, the case continued to be heard for the purposes of additional attorney's compensation requested by Belzer's lawyers, which was denied by the court.  Background  Richard Belzer is a comedian who was the host of Hot Properties on television in 1985. During one episode, he was interviewing Hulk Hogan and Mr. T live for their upcoming World Wrestling Federation WrestleMania I tag team match. Belzer persistently asked Hogan to put him in a wrestling hold, which Hogan initially resisted doing, but later acquiesced to the request, after comments from Mr. T and the audience. Hogan put Belzer in a front chin lock and applied it, which led to Belzer passing out. As he did so, Belzer slipped from Hogan's grasp and hit his head on the floor. Belzer later awoke to cut to a commercial break, and went to the hospital to have nine stitches in the back of his head where he hit the floor. Following the commercial break, Hogan, keeping kayfabe, apologized for injuring Belzer, and cited the dangers of using professional wrestling moves on people who were untrained. Belzer appeared on Hot Properties a week later, and showed the stitches that resulted from the incident. He sued Hogan for $5 million in damages for personal injury.  Trial  The case was due to be heard at the New York Supreme Court. However, Belzer and Hogan reached an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed amount. Belzer's lawyers said they were entitled to 50% of the settlement instead of the regular 1/3 contingent fee, due to the \\"angst, aggravation and life's blood\\" they had spent on the case; the case continued in order to decide this. Despite providing a letter from Belzer praising them for their work and appearing supportive of the application, Belzer stated that he only agreed to that under duress, as he felt emotionally drained by the case and feared if he refused, then it could jeopardize the settlement with Hogan if he hired new lawyers. Belzer stated he did not personally agree with the additional fees, which caused the lawyers to call him \\"a paradigm of ingratitude\\". The judge ruled that under New York Codes, Rules and Regulations, lawyers' compensation could either be based upon a sliding scale of permissible recovery, or on an agreed-upon contingent fee. Belzer had agreed a retainer agreement for the 1/3 contingent fee prior to the case. The lawyers argued that, as they had spent over 50 hours preparing the case, then their services were worth more than the contingent fee. The judge denied this request, stating that that was a risk that the lawyers had voluntarily taken when they signed the initial agreement. The Court issued a judgment in favor of Belzer, and declared that any section of the signed agreement for compensation greater than the 1/3 contingent fee was null and void, \\"no matter how sterling the representation may have been\\".  Aftermath  Following the case, Belzer used the money to buy a farmhouse in Nice, France, which he ironically named \\"Chez Hogan\\". Hogan would go on to become one of the most popular professional wrestlers, because of his status as WWF Champion at the forefront of the 1980s professional wrestling boom. The case would be cited as legal precedent in New York State law relating to attorney's contingent fees.

She also holds an adjunct affiliation with the University of Agder, and is a member of the CHI Academy. Contributions Palen's research involves searching for \\"ways in which we can communicate uncertainty and probability and risk to the public\\" and translating that information into recommendations on how disaster victims should respond. She has also studied the ways that people use social media during disasters. According to Palen, the first uses of these platforms in these ways came during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and their use has become much more widespread since then. Her tips for using social media in emergency situations include being specific about locations and conditions, avoiding trying to remain emotionless and unaffected, and helping to gather and check information when not directly affected. Education and career Palen studied computer science and psychology at the University of Stirling from 1988 to 1989, and graduated in 1991 from the University of California, San Diego with a bachelor's degree in cognitive science.

Born at Cowbridge in Glamorgan, Williams' father was a Methodist minister. Williams was one of eighteen children, and was sent out to work at the Penygraig Colliery when he was nine years old. He found religion to be a welcome relief from long working days, and began preaching when he was thirteen years old. In 1877, Williams won a Dr Williams Scholarship to study at Carmarthen College, and he was ordained three years later. From 1884, he was a minister at Neath, then in 1888 he transferred to Bradford, where he became interested in socialism. The Manchester Guardian described him as \\"holding advanced views on religion, which he expressed vigorously... regarded by older people as almost too heretical for the Congregational ministry\\". However, he became known as a powerful and persuasive preacher, and won a considerable following. Williams was a founding vice-president of the League of Progressive Thought in 1908, working closely with the Reverend R. J. Campbell. He transferred to Brighton in 1909, taking over Campbell's congregation, and remained there for the rest of his career. At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, Williams stood for the Labour Party in Cambridge, taking 24.7% of the vote. Williams served as chair of the Congregational Church of England and Wales in 1929/30. He wrote many religious tracts, and after his retirement in 1931, he wrote two autobiographical works: Faith Without Fear and How I found my Faith: a Religious Pilgrimage.

He served as Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Territory of Hawaii following annexation to the United States. Appointed Inspector General of Schools for the Kingdom of Hawaii, he served under the administrations of KalƒÅkaua and Lili ªuokalani, and continued in the position under the Provisional Government of Hawaii and the Republic of Hawaii . A journalist and newspaper owner, he is believed to have been one of two authors of satirical works lampooning Walter Murray Gibson cabinet regime under KalƒÅkaua. Atkinson Drive in the Ala Moana area of Honolulu, was named to honor him. Background He was born in the small town of Qapal in the Kazakh steppes of Central Asia, to British explorers Lucy Atkinson and Thomas Witlam Atkinson, who named him after the famous Tamshybulak Spring in Qapal and the Alatau Mountains (Tien Shan), and spent the first ten years of his life in Siberia, Central Asia, and St Petersburg. After his father's death in Kent, England when Alatau was ten years old, a public fund-raising appeal by Sir Roderick Murchison, President of the Royal Geographical Society, helped finance Alatau's education at Rugby School. After a brief career in Russia as Secretary of the Turko-Russian boundary commission, he changed careers to become a writer for the British newspaper the Newcastle Courant. He briefly held a teaching position in England at Durham School. Hawaii's school system An 1854 treaty for Hawaii's annexation to the United States had been submitted to Kamehameha III, but he never signed it. During the 1863‚Äì1872 reign of Kamehameha V, the Hawaiian language was still the predominant communication in Hawaii's schools. Increasing exposure to the outside world was being brought by the sea trade, missionaries, and foreigners operating sugar plantations in the islands. In 1867, a proposed reciprocity treaty, tax relief for sugar planters, had gotten as far as the United States Congress, but was defeated in the Senate. Atkinson was offered a position by Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley in 1868, to become instructor and principal at St. Alban's College in Pauoa, Hawaii. He left England together with his wife Annie (nee Humble) and his daughter Zoe in 1869 for the long sea journey to Hawaii. St. Alban's would later merge with  ªIolani School. Atkinson would later also be given charge of the Fort Street School. He believed that fluency in a common language used by the outside world would be a vital necessity for the coming generations of Hawaiians. It became his life's career to convert Hawaii's schools into using English as the predominant language.; In 1887 he was appointed Inspector General of Schools for the Kingdom of Hawaii, serving under both KalƒÅkaua and Lili ªuokalani. He remained in that position under Dole during the Republic of Hawaii. When Hawaii became a territory, Atkinson was appointed Superintendent of Public Instruction. Elected representative Atkinson represented the Fourth District of Hawaii in the Legislature of the Republic of Hawaii for the February 16 ‚Äì July 7, 1898 session. Hawaii was annexed by the United States on August 12 1898. Writing He was editor of the Hawaiian Gazette, and was president of Hawaiian Star Newspaper Association. Atkinson and/or Vice Chamberlain Edward William Purvis are to believed to have been the authors of The Grand Duke of Gynbergdrinkenstein, a 3-act burlesque originally published in 1886 as a satirical jab at KalƒÅkaua's cabinet under the helm of Walter M. Gibson. The character of Herr Von Boss was believed to have been wealthy sugar baron Claus Spreckels. A second version was published in 1887 as The Gynberg Ballads. British Commissioner James Hay Wodehouse believed the satire rang true to the king's cabinet under Gibson, and made sure numerous officials in London received copies. Government reports  * Personal life Atkinson married Annie Humble in England in January 1868. They sailed to Hawaii in 1869, by way of Panama and San Francisco. He died April 24, 1906 as a result of a series of strokes after a lengthy illness. Upon his death, all schools were closed in his honor. Atkinson Drive in the Ala Moana area of Honolulu is named for him. Annie Atkinson died of pneumonia in 1911. The couple had four daughters and three sons: 1\\\\.

The bridge was designed by Ernest de Burgh and built in 1902-03 by William Murphy and James Taylor. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  Timber truss bridges Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid-19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Ernest de Burgh, the designer of de Burgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that New South Wales was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\". Glennies Creek Bridge The bridge was built in 1902-03 at a cost of A¬£4,100.  Description  The bridge over Glennies Creek is a de Burgh- type timber truss road bridge. It has two timber truss spans, each of . There are single timber approach spans at each end giving the bridge an overall length of . The bridge super structure is supported by twin Monier concrete cylinders with metal bracing. The bridge provides a single lane carriage way with a minimum width of . A timber post-and-rail guard rail extends the full length of the bridge.  Heritage listing  The Middle Falbrook bridge is a de Burgh timber truss road bridge. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest de Burgh, the designer of this type of truss. de Burgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works' engineer Ernest M. de Burgh, the de Burgh truss is an adaptation of the American Pratt truss design. The de Burgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber. de Burgh trusses were significant technical improvements over their predecessors. The Middle Falbrook bridge has piers made from Monier pipes filled with concrete, which is representative of the emerging concrete technology in bridge construction. Middle Falbrook Bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were ten surviving de Burgh trusses in NSW of the twenty built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Middle Falbrook bridge is a representative example of de Burgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. Middle Falbrook Bridge over Glennies Creek was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest de Burgh, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare - only de Burgh truss bridge with Monier concrete pipe piers. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Representative of de Burgh truss bridges.
