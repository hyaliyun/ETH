The stated purpose of these regular meetings is \\"to provide an opportunity for the international intelligence community to listen to and learn from each other, and to share ideas in the common war against terrorism.\\" Organization According to the Intelligence Summit's website, the meetings are run by organizers (Robert Katz and John Loftus) and an Advisory Council, which includes or included in the past \\"two former heads of CIA, the head of British Joint Intelligence, senior officials of the Mossad, the former Director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism, the former director of the Indian Counter Intelligence Service, generals of the US Army and Air Force intelligence services, and academic experts\\". Among the Advisory Council members are the author and consultant Yossef Bodansky, special operations expert Richard Marcinko, and retired generals and Fox News military analysts Paul E. Vallely and Tom McInerney. Funding Ron Jacobs notes that the primary sponsor of the conference, Michael Cherney, \\"is the subject of controversy and is currently denied entry into the United States because of his indictment on various charges in Russia and Israel.\\" Jacobs points out that \\"Cherney is well-known among supporters of Israel and has contributed millions of dollars to various organizations on the right end of Israel's political spectrum, as well as several thousands to the US Republican Party.\\"Ron Jacobs, \\"Kenneth Timmerman's Iranian 'Democracy' and the 'Intelligence' Summit\\" The St. Petersburg Times confirms that Cherney is the main contributor to the Summit and notes that \\"the United States has denied Cherney a visa since 1999 because of alleged ties to the Russian mafia.\\" Cherney is listed for organized crime and money laundering on the Interpol Red List of wanted persons.Interpol Red List Entry for Michael Cherney, , accessed June 3, 2013 Loftus counters that Cherney \\"was framed by [former Director of the Office of National Intelligence John] Negroponte.\\"Meg Laughlin, \\"Intelligence conference draws criticism,\\" St. Petersburg Times (6 March 2007) p. 1A. Controversies John Loftus has come under fire from former representatives of the International Holocaust Education Center, who are concerned about him using the organization's tax-exempt status improperly to promote his intelligence activities. The St. Petersburg Times noted that \\"Walter Loebenberg, who founded the Holocaust Education Center and approved of turning the name over to Loftus in 2005 because of his high regard for him, says that he knew Loftus was doing intelligence work at the time. 'But ... we agreed he would change the name if he did his intelligence work under the name of the Holocaust Education Center. It has gone farther than we expected,' said Loebenberg. 'We never would have organized or sponsored an intelligence conference.'\\" An Internal Revenue Service spokesperson explained the impropriety: \\"If a tax-exempt charitable organization changes the name, the purpose or the structure, it must let IRS know by corresponding with us. And, it must remain neutral and nonpartisan.\\" Loftus has also been criticized for listing sponsors of the Summit who never consented to being so listed, including Konica Minolta and Florida Holocaust Museum board member Bruce Epstein. Objectives The Intelligence Summit's emphasis is upon terrorism and jihad related issues;Intelligence Summit Discusses Jihad in India - March 26, 2007, India Cause former Jamaa Islamia terrorist and author Tawfik Hamid is on the Summit's Advisory Council. Ahmed Bedier of the Council on American- Islamic Relations noted of Hamid's participation in the Summit, \\"The Intelligence Summit is a group of neoconservatives and private intelligence agencies that are benefiting from the war on terrorism. And opportunists like Hamid and others at this event are bashing and cashing and making money from it.\\"Glenn Beck, \\"Moderate Muslims Speak out Against Extremism,\\" CNN (5 March 2007).

The novel was inspired by the idea of \\"a 24-year-old hoax brought to life ‚Äì original, angry, multilingual, learned. He was interested in what the being would know instinctively and what he would be ignorant of. How would the creator deal with his creation, and the creation with his creator?\\"Moran, Jennifer (2003) Carey's powerful plea for novel as act of imagination, The Canberra Times, 21 August 2003, p. 3 He realised as he was writing the book that he was not interested in James McAuley and Harold Stewart who perpetrated the hoax but in \\"magical thinking\\". It is told as a first-person narrative from the point of view of a young woman editing a literary magazine, and is presented as her account of her encounter with the perpetrator of the hoax after many years. However, it was originally written in the voice of \\"the created being\\". Carey takes a number of significant liberties in his novelization, not the least of which is his decision to make the Ern Malley counterpart (called Bob McCorkle in the story) an actual person who ends up haunting his \\"creator.\\" Themes A major theme of the novel is the ambiguity of reality, as the reader must wrestle with the question of whether the man claiming to be Bob McCorkle is a maniac with an identity delusion, a hoaxer's hoaxer, a coincidence, or a phantasm called into being by his creator. As a discussion of and commentary on modern poetry, particularly Australian poetry, the novel makes many references to Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, W. H.

He was involved in various progressive movements and controversial issues in the Islamic community in Lagos for most of the first half of the twentieth century,H.O. Danmole, A Visionary of the Lagos Muslim Community: Mustapha Adamu Animashaun, 1885‚Äì1968. Lagos Historical Society, Vol 5, 2005. p 1. when the Muslims then constituted about half of the Lagos population. His major influence was also his master, a prominent Lagos Muslim, Idris Animashaun. As a religious leader, he promoted the adoption of Western education among Muslims and sought the enactment of a constitution for the Lagos Central Mosque and the general Lagos Muslim community. However, the agitation for the latter led to some conflicts with fellow Muslims in Lagos.Danmole p 2 Early life Animashaun was born as a freeman in the ancient city of Kano. The name of his father was Usman, while his mother was the daughter of the Chief Imam of Kano, Mallam Ibrahim. At the early age of eight, he lost his status as a freeman when he was captured as a slave, during a turbulent time in Kano. He was then sold to the palace of the Emir of Zazzau and was trained by the emir's son. As a steward in the Emir's palace, he was afforded the opportunity to travel to a few Northern Nigerian cities, he also lived in Cairo for five years. However, his search for freedom soon hit the rocks; while returning from Egypt, he was captured again and re-sold as a slave to the Waziri of Sokoto. He later left the Islamic city of Sokoto for Ilorin with a Sokoto man, Mallam Madugu. In Ilorin, he was sold to Alfa (cleric) Bello of Agbaji quarters, an Islamic center of renowned scholarship. While in Ilorin, he was raised and taught in the Islamic way; he also chose the name Adamu, a popular name at the time and was also quite popular among his peers.Danmole p 4. He was finally sold to his last master, Idris Animashaun, the head of a government Muslim school in Lagos. He enrolled in the Muslim school in 1896, where he was able to apply the Arabic and astrology knowledge he had learned in Egypt and Ilorin. His experience in the school was quite a success, he only spent two years in the school as he was already an astute and literate man well versed in Islamic knowledge which was the major vocal point of the Lagos Islamic School. Career Shop manager After completing his studies, he apprenticed under his tutor and master, Idris Animashaun as an assistant Shop keeper. He later became the manager of the shop in 1912. During the same year, he was given a certificate of freedom and he became a freeman. He then followed his mentor's foot step and opened a shop in 1913, the shop specialised in selling Arabic books on Shitta street, Lagos. By the time, he had begun to assimilate into the elite Muslim community of Lagos, due in part to the influence of Idris Animashaun. He married, the daughter of the Chief Imam of Lagos, the cleric Ibrahim. Publisher and author To complement the services offered in his store, he opened a small printing business in 1914. The business was involved in printing Islamic related posters and notices. He also used the business to print his version of a Nigerian almanac. He used his astrology knowledge to predict events for individual clients who came to his office, while he gained popularity as a fortune teller due in large part to his knowledge of the Arabic language and astrology which was quite high in relation to many residents of Lagos. However, his style of prediction mostly used and extrapolated from world and local events and societal issues. In 1918, he acquired the Lagos Central Times from Mr Davies. The Times was established three and a half years earlier. He bought the paper after negative news generated as a result of a crisis in the Lagos Central Mosque. The paper was later financed by the Muslim community up to 1924. The Lagos crisis was between the Chief Imam, who had reneged on an earlier agreement to sign a constitution for the Lagos Muslim community while the members of the mosque, led by Animashaun had campaigned for rules and regulations for the central mosque. The crisis induced bad publicity for the Muslim community in the local press. To avail on what he felt was a propensity to inadequate reporting from the mainstream Lagos press on the Muslim community. He bought and became for a short time, the editor of the newspaper. He was quite successful, as the newspaper grew rapidly in its early years.Danmole p 9. As the publisher of the newspaper, he began to use the medium for his personal views on many issues, including a controversial Islamic group, the Ahmadiyya society. His influence among the community began to grow, so also did his opposition, including opposition from the Ahmadi's. In 1937, he published a pamphlet on the History of Islam in Lagos. The book detailed the history of Imams of the central mosque and became an authoritative source on the timeline of Imams in Lagos. The book also expanded on major developments in the Lagos community from 1770 to the 1920s.Danmole p 14. Promoting education Animashaun was a well read man and he wanted to improve the educational facilities available to Muslims in Lagos. From most indications he was a bibliophile, and well versed in the rudimentary of economics, Nigerian politics and Islamic studies and established a Muslim training school in Lagos. The school dealt mostly with literacy, as primary subjects where Arabic and English language. This approach to spreading education was soon followed by the Ahmadiyya movement and the Ansaruddeen society. A desired goal of his was to educate Muslim children to be employed as clerical workers in the Colonial Service. Later life Animashaun left the heart of Lagos for Mushin, a district of the larger Lagos State in the 1930s. He later became the Seriki of Mushin, (leader of Mushin Muslims) and was a founding member of the United Muslim Party in 1953.

Breck is commemorated on April 2 on the Episcopal calendar of saints. Early life and education Breck was born in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth son of Catherine D. n√©e Israell and George Breck. He attended high school at the Flushing Institute (at Flushing, New York), founded by William Augustus Muhlenberg, who inspired him to resolve at the age of sixteen to devote himself to missionary activity. Senator James Lloyd of Massachusetts and Breck's uncle financed his education at Flushing and the University of Pennsylvania.Robert W. Prichard. \\"Breck, James Lloyd\\"; http://www.anb.org/articles/08/08-00172.html; American National Biography Online Feb. 2000. He received a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1838 and a B.D. from the General Theological Seminary in 1841. At the seminary he was heavily influenced by William Whittingham and the high church movement.Dictionary of American Biography Vol. 2 p. 3 Career In 1842, by then a deacon in the Episcopal Church, he went to the frontier of Wisconsin with two classmates, under the direction of Bishop Jackson Kemper, to found Nashotah House, intended as a monastic community, a seminary, and a center for theological work. It continues today as a seminary. Breck was ordained into the priesthood later that year by the Missionary Bishop, Jackson Kemper at the Oneida Indian settlement 150 miles north of Nashotah.Nashotah Scholiast Vol.4 No.2, 1886, p. 28-30 Breck (right) with Enmegahbowh (The Rev. John Johnson) (left) and Isaac Manitowab (center). In 1850 Breck moved to Minnesota where he began another mission. On June 23, 1850 he celebrated the first Episcopal Eucharist in the La Crosse area.Goldstein, Norm, editor, Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, 2000, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Perseus Publishing, pp. 84-85. Two years later he began work among the Ojibway, founding St. Columba Mission. In 1855 Breck married Jane Maria Mills, one of the teachers at the St. Columba Mission. He opened another mission at Leech Lake in 1856, and then in 1857 he moved to Faribault where he and the Rev. Solon Manney began a mission school to train clergy to work in Minnesota missions.Pritchard, \\"Breck\\". Breck worked closely with the first Bishop of Minnesota, Henry Whipple and the mission school for clergy became Seabury Seminary which survives today as Bexley-Seabury Western Seminary in Chicago.Seabury: About Seabury: Seabury's History Jane Breck died in 1862 and Breck married Sarah Stiles in 1864.Pritchard, \\"Breck.\\" Three years later he moved to Benicia, California to build another two institutions. Breck was known as \\"The Apostle of the Wilderness\\". Death Breck's grave at Nashotah House Breck died in Benicia in 1876. He was buried beneath the altar of the church he served as rector but later his body was removed and reinterred on the grounds of Nashotah House in Nashotah, Wisconsin. The recommittal service there had 14 bishops, about 100 priests, and many lay people in attendance. Legacy Breck's major legacies were Nashotah House Seminary, Seabury Seminary, and several other institutions since closed including Racine College in Delafield, Wisconsin, St. Augustine College in Benecia, California, and St. Mary's School in Benecia. Breck School in Golden Valley, Minnesota, founded in 1886, was named for him. Henry M.

She gave all her time and energy to her patients and died at the age of 35 from typhus fever. Florence Nightingale said of Agnes Elizabeth Jones, ‚ÄòShe overworked as others underwork. I looked upon hers as one of the most valuable lives in England.‚Äô Life Agnes Jones was born on 10 November 1832 in Cambridge into a wealthy family with both military and evangelical religious connections. Her uncle was Sir John Lawrence, later Lord Lawrence who went on to become Governor General of India. In the early years of Jones' life, the family moved to Fahan in County Donegal, Ireland, though they followed her father's career with the army, notably to Mauritius. Her home education was supplemented when she went to Miss Ainsworth's school at Avonbank near Staford up Avon and stayed until 1850. During a holiday in Europe with her family she met and was deeply impressed by deaconesses who were from the Institution of Kaiserwerth, which had earlier overseen the early nursing experiences of Florence Nightingale. She visited the Institution in Bonn, and saw the hospital, orphanage, an asylum and two schools run by the deaconesses. Jones returned home to Ireland and used the experience she had gained. In 1859 she went to London, making contact with Florence Nightingale and Sarah E. Wardroper, senior nurse of St Thomas Hospital. Nightingale said of her that she was \\" a woman attractive and rich and young and witty; yet a veiled and silent woman, distinguished by no other genius than the divine genius\\" In 1862 Agnes Jones commenced nurse training in the Nightingale School at St Thomas Hospital in London. When her year's training was complete, Nightingale called her our \\"best and dearest pupil\\". However her greatest work was ahead of her and was in Liverpool. Liverpool Workhouse Infirmary, at Brownlow Hill was one of the largest infirmaries in the country. It catered for 1200 sick paupers. Liverpool philanthropist William Rathbone obtained permission from the Liverpool Vestry to introduce trained nurses (at his own expense for three years) at the workhouse hospital in 1864, and invited Jones to move from the London Great Northern Hospital, to be the first trained Nursing Superintendent in 1865. The conditions in the infirmary when she arrived were described as \\"disorder, extravagance of every description in the establishment to an incredible degree\\". Soon after she arrived, Jones brought 12 trained nurses and seven probationers (all trained at the Nightingale School of Nursing in London) to the infirmary. This initial group were supplemented by further probationers and 54 able-bodied female inmates who were paid a small salary. This was the first training for nurses in any workhouse infirmary, paving the way for nurse training systems in other workhouses across the UK; social reformer Eva McLaren was among those trained there as a nurse. Death and legacy Liverpool Anglican cathedral Agnes Jones House is a converted Women's hospital that is now a student's hall of residence Statue of Agnes Elizabeth Jones in The Oratory, St James Cemetery, Liverpool Jones' contribution to the welfare of the sick paupers was enormous, and she worked tirelessly to make the experiment a success. However the work took its toll upon her, and at the age of just 35 years of age she died of typhus fever. This condition was endemic among the poor of Liverpool during this period. Jones's only publication was a Bible study, The Gospel Promises shown in Isaiah I to VI. Her sister published her Memorials of Agnes Elizabeth Jones in 1871. A Guardian review of Nightingale's introductionin a Times advertisement for a later \\"cheaper\\" edition said it \\"should read like a trumpet call in the ears of any lady who is conscious of a similar vocation\\".Times 8 April 1872 10B The memory of her outstanding contribution to nursing, to Liverpool and to the poor is commemorated in Liverpool. A window in the Anglican Cathedral is dedicated to her memory, and a statue to her exists in the Cathedral Oratory. Also, a local housing association has named a large student hall of residence after her. Agnes Jones is now buried in her beloved Ireland. Her recently refurbished grave can be found in the quiet country graveyard of Fahan, 4 miles east from Buncranna in County Donegal. This graveyard is also home to one of the oldest Celtic covering stones in Ireland dating back to the time of St. Columba.

He made his major league debut on April 24, 1934 for the Browns in a 15-2 loss to the Cleveland Indians. Used as a utility infielder for the remainder of the season, Bejma hit .271 in 95 games (both career highs) and played four positions (shortstop, second base, third base, and outfield). He also achieved career highs in doubles (16), triples (3), stolen bases (3), walks (40), strikeouts (36), slugging percentage (.378), and hit by pitch (4, which was tied for third in the American League that year). Bejma was born in South Bend, Indiana. He batted and threw right-handed. He spent the next two seasons with the Browns in a somewhat less frequent reserve role, filling in at every infield position but first base. Bejma made no major league appearances in the 1937 or 1938 seasons, spending the latter in the minor league system of the Chicago White Sox, who had purchased him from the Browns in March 1938. He made his debut with the White Sox in 1939 and went on to log more at-bats (307) that year than any previous season of his career. He also surprisingly tallied 8 home runs, despite having hit only 6 in 599 major league at-bats coming into 1939. This contributed to his career best of 44 runs batted in. Bejma's last game was on October 1, 1939, a 4-3 loss to Bejma's original team, the St. Louis Browns. He was traded by the White Sox with Johnny Gerlach to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Skeeter Webb. Though Webb played for another nine seasons in the majors, neither Gerlach nor Bejma ever again appeared in a big-league game. Bejma was somewhat immortalized in a Peanuts comic strip on February 21, 1974, cited as having been the starting shortstop for St. Paul of the American Association when they won their pennant in 1938.February 21, 1974 episode of Peanuts In fact, he was the team's second baseman, and he was instrumental in leading the club to the American Association championship that year.

It occurs in normal individuals and typically starts and disappears spontaneously. However, it can sometimes last up to three weeks. Since the condition typically resolves itself, medical professionals do not consider it to be serious or a cause for concern.

Page 5) was a physician and a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He is suspected of the murder of his fourth wife, who died of morphine poisoning. His first three wives also predeceased him, raising suspicions that he murdered them as well. Clements committed suicide by an overdose of morphine before he was caught by the police.Briend, Bernadette (2 February 2000). \\"Trust me, I'm a doctor\\". Health Service Journal. Retrieved January 29, 2019. Life Clements was born in 1880 in Belfast, Ireland. He graduated in 1904, aged 24.The collected works of Max Haines, Volume 4, Max Haines, 2000. Page 571 Marriages and deaths Clements married four times, three of his four wives were heiresses. His first wife, Edith (or Edyth) Annie Mercier, who was active in the Ulster Women‚Äôs Unionist Council and the daughter of a wealthy Belfast grain merchant, Dufferin Flour and Meal Mills owner William Turpin Mercier, died of \\"sleeping sickness\\" in 1920, aged 40. His second wife, Mary McCreary, was the daughter of an Irish industrialist based in Manchester; her 1925 death was ascribed to endocarditis, at aged 25. His third wife, Sarah Kathleen Burke (known as Kathleen), died on 27 May 1939, which was ascribed to endocarditis, and was quickly cremated,The People's almanac presents the book of lists, David Wallechinsky, Irving Wallace, Amy Wallace, 1977. Page 70 though the police had made an attempt to halt the cremation. By all accounts, Clements' had genuine affection for Burke. His last wife, Amy Victoria \\"Vee\\" Barnett, (often written as Burnett) was the daughter of one of Clements' few patients, Reginald W. G. Barnett, the wealthy managing director of the Liverpool Cartage Company, who died suddenly in January 1940, six months prior to his daughter's June nuptials. She died on 27 May 1947, under suspicious circumstances, in Southport. The previous day, Clements had called in another doctor when his wife fell ill. She was taken to a nursing home where she died the next day.The new murderers' who's who, page 86 Both Clements and the other doctor called in diagnosed myeloid leukemia, which was confirmed by a botched post-mortem carried out by another physician, James Houston, who, one week after her death, committed suicide in regret of his negligence. The circumstances of Burnett's death caused people at the time to question the deaths of Clement's first three wives. All, with the exception of the third, were wealthy women when he married them and were almost penniless at the time of their deaths. Clements signed the death certificates himself, and although there were some suspicions voiced following the death of his third wife there were no opportunities to perform a post-mortem, due to her body having already been cremated. When the police came to arrest Clements they found that he had committed suicide, via an overdose of morphine. A second autopsy was conducted by a Dr. Grace who deduced that she had died from morphine poisoning. This was confirmed by Dr J.B. Firth, Director of the Home Office Laboratory in Preston.The medical murderer, 1967. Page 150 Clements is thought to have murdered Burnett in order to inherit her money. When Houston found out that his post-mortem had missed the presence of morphine, he, too, committed suicide.Haines, Max. \\"Crime Flashback - Practice makes perfect\\". Toronto Sun.

Introduced in the book Chessmen of Mars, the Kaldanes are almost all head, but for six arachnoid legs and a pair of chelae. Their racial goal is to achieve pure intellect against bodily existence: In order to function in the physical realm, the Kaldanes have bred the Rykors: a nonsentient complementary species composed of a body similar to that of a Red Martian but lacking a head; when the Kaldane places itself upon the shoulders of the Rykor, a bundle of tentacles connects with the Rykor's spinal cord, allowing the brain of the Kaldane to control its motor nerves and sensory nerves. Should the Rykor become damaged or die, the Kaldane climbs upon another. Although the Rykors breed like other animals, the Kaldanes do not breed except for their \\"king\\": The Kaldanes are also imbued with conscious race memory, obtained through selective breeding.

Riordan, 85, Ex-Bell Labs Engineer, The New York Times obituary, August 31, 1988 was an American mathematician and the author of major early works in combinatorics, particularly Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis and Combinatorial Identities. Biography Riordan was a graduate of Yale University. In his early life he wrote a number of poems and essays and a book of short-stories, On the Make, published in 1929, and was Editor-in-Chief of Salient and The Figure in the Carpet, literary magazines published by The New School for Social Research in New York. He married Mavis McIntosh, the well-known poet and literary agent and founder of McIntosh & Otis. The couple had two daughters: Sheila Riordan and Kathleen Riordan Speeth, and were long time residents of Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.Mavis McIntosh Riordan, 83; Represented Noted Writers, The New York Times obituary, August 6, 1986. Riordan's long professional career was at Bell Labs, which he joined in 1926 (a year after its foundation) and where he remained, publishing over a hundred scholarly papers on combinatorial analysis, until he retired in 1968. He then joined the faculty at Rockefeller University as professor emeritus. A Festschrift was published in his honor in 1978. Throughout his life Riordan led an active literary life, with many distinguished friends such as Kenneth Burke, William Carlos Williams, and A. R. Orage. The Riordan array, created by mathematician Louis W. Shapiro, is named after John Riordan .  Tribute  From the Introduction by Marc Kac to the Special Issue of the JCTA in honor of John Riordan: : Foremost among the keepers of the barely flickering combinatorial flame was John Riordan. John‚Äôs work in Combinatorial Theory (or Combinatorial Analysis as he prefers to call it) is uncompromisingly classical in spirit and appearance. Though largely tolerant of modernity he does not let anyone forget that Combinatorial Analysis is the art and science of counting (enumerating is the word he prefers) and that a generating function by any other name or definition is still a generating function. From an interview with Neil Sloane published by Bell Labs: : Even at the end of my first year as a graduate student at Cornell, in 1962, I managed to arrange a summer job at Bell Labs in Holmdel. This was still on minimal cost networks. During that summer I met another of my heroes, John Riordan, one of the great early workers in combinatorics. His book An Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis is a classic. He was working at Bell Labs in West Street in Manhattan at that time. One of my earliest papers, on a problem that came up in my thesis work, was a joint paper with him.

Organized into 16 diverse practice areas covering a broad spectrum of industry sectors, Gensler delivers a range of project types for clients around the world. In 2017, Gensler generated $1.197 billion in revenue, the most of any architecture firm in the United States. As of 2018, Gensler operated offices in 48 cities in 16 countries worldwide, working for clients in over 100 countries. History Art Gensler, along with his wife Drue Gensler and their associate James Follett, founded the firm in 1965. They originally focused on corporate interiors, pioneering interiors for newly constructed office buildings, including the Alcoa Building (1967) and the Bank of America Building (1969), both in San Francisco. The firm has since diversified into numerous forms of architecture and design, including commercial office buildings, retail centers, airports, education facilities, entertainment complexes, planning and urban design, mission-critical facilities, consulting, brand design, and other areas. Gensler grew rapidly with offices opening around the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s and then overseas in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1972, the firm established an office in Houston to provide interior design services for Pennzoil Company's 600,000-sq-ft corporate headquarters. In 1979, the firm opened its New York office to provide interior design and production services for Mobil Oil Corporation's corporate headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia. In 1988, the firm launched its first overseas office in London, followed by new offices in Tokyo and Hong Kong in 1993. In 2002, Gensler opened an office in Shanghai, establishing a permanent presence in China. By the early 2000s, Gensler was the largest architecture and design company headquartered in the U.S. In 2005, Gensler's Board of Directors extended the firm's collaborative leadership structure by naming Andy Cohen, Diane Hoskins, and David Gensler as Executive Directors/Co-CEOs. Cohen and Hoskins continue their tenure as Co- CEOs. As the firm's global footprint has grown, Gensler has launched megaprojects such as CityCenter (Gensler served as Executive Architect of the 67-acre, 18 million-square-foot ‚Äúcity within a city‚Äù in Las Vegas), SFO Airport (beginning with the Central Terminal project in 1980 and continuing with comprehensive T2, T3, and T1 renovations), and Shanghai Tower (a 128-story mixed-use tower). In 2013, the 2,073-foot Shanghai Tower became China's tallest building, and the second-tallest in the world. In 1990, Gensler established Gensler University, the firm's chief platform for leadership development. Subsequently, the firm established the Diversity Scholarship, a juried program that recognizes emerging talent among African- American college students enrolled in an accredited architectural program, and the Gensler Brinkmann Scholarship Fund, which was established in 1999 as a memorial to Donald G. Brinkmann, a gifted interior designer and former partner at Gensler. In 2007, the firm established its gServe community impact program. Gensler's Community Impact program encourages offices to dedicate at least 80 percent of their Community Impact resources to one or more of four themes: Housing and Homelessness, Health and Wellness, the Environment, and the Next Generation. The model organizes the firm's philanthropic and volunteer efforts with a focused strategy to be part of the solution to the major issues facing cities today and tomorrow. In 2005, Gensler debuted its first U.K. Workplace Survey, followed by a U.S. Workplace Survey in 2006, and the formal establishment of the Gensler Research program in 2007. The firm launched subsequent U.S. & U.K. Workplace Surveys in 2008, 2013, and 2016. Gensler's Workplace Surveys now encompass four continents, with the Asia Workplace Survey 2016, and Latin America Workplace Survey 2017. In 2010, Gensler's research program secured a registered trademark for its Workplace Performance Index (WPI), a trademarked pre- and post-occupancy tool. In 2017, Gensler celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Gensler Research Program (now the Gensler Research Institute) with the publication of Gensler's Research Catalogue, Volume 2. In 2017, the firm launched the Gensler Experience Index, which quantifies the direct impact design has on experience, followed by industry reports in the Retail and Hospitality sectors. In 2016, Gensler signed the Paris Pledge for Action at the COP21 conference, pledging to reduce carbon emissions to limit climate change to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Gensler's ‚ÄúImpact Through Design‚Äù report, launched in 2016, explores strategies for architecture and design to play a greater role in global climate change strategy and mitigation, reinforcing this commitment to sustainability with the firm's subsequent ‚ÄúImpact by Design‚Äù reports in 2017 and 2018. Recognition Shanghai Tower, Shanghai. Gensler was awarded the Architecture Firm Award in 2000 by the American Institute of Architects. In 2009, Gensler became the first firm inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame. Gensler received the AIA Institute Honor Award for Architecture for the HyundaiCard Air Lounge in 2012 and the Jackson Hole Airport in 2014.

A member of the prominent Bush- Walker family, he was a maternal uncle of US President George H.W. Bush. Biography Walker was the fifth of six children of banker and businessman George Herbert Walker and his wife Lucretia Wear, daughter of James H. Wear. (Dr. Walker's older sister Dorothy married President Bush's father Senator Prescott Bush.) Walker attended The Hill School and later Yale University, where he lettered in football, baseball and squash, was a member of Skull and Bones, and graduated in 1931. In 1936, Walker graduated from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and went on to his residency at Roosevelt Hospital. In 1939, he married Elsie Louise Mead, daughter of George Houk Mead, president of the Mead Corporation. They had three sons and four daughters. One daughter died of polio in 1955 and two daughters were born with Down syndrome. During World War II he served as a major in the US Army in Europe. Walker had a private practice until he was diagnosed with polio in 1950. A skilled athlete and golfer, he would eventually need a wheelchair. In 1952, he joined Memorial Hospital (now part of Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center) as a clinical assistant in surgery and remained with the institution for 25 years, serving as president from 1965 to 1974. In 1953, future President Bush's daughter Pauline Robinson \\"Robin\\" Bush was diagnosed with leukemia. A local doctor advised them that treatment was futile, but Walker helped her get admitted to Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering. She lived another six months and died shortly before her fourth birthday. President Bush later wrote about his uncle: > He was a great cancer surgeon, who had been stricken with polio. A strong > and purposeful man. I told him of our local doc's advise and he said \\"You > have no choice - none at all - you must treat this child.

Walker & Co., founded by his father in 1900, and a limited partner in Alex. Brown & Sons. In 1971, he retired to a farm in Easton, Maryland which for two decades he ran profitably for a third career. He spent summers with his extended family in Kennebunkport, Maine. In 1989, President Bush appointed Walker's eldest son District Judge John M. Walker Jr. to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Bush told a White House lawyer \\"It's the least I can do for someone whose father did so much for me. Besides, Johnny's as well qualified as anyone else for the position.\\" In 1990, while in Kennebunkport and after a martini with his brother, Walker died that same evening of complications from an aneurism at age 83.

Although he did not win election to the Illinois Senate from Bloomington, Illinois, he served on both the Illinois Circuit Courts (1862-1870) and the Supreme Court of Illinois (1870-1888), including three one-year terms as Chief Justice. The trust he established in his will funded the first hospital in Bloomington and continues to fund local healthcare today. Early life John Milton Scott was born in August 1, 1824 in Belleville, Illinois. His parents were wealthy and could afford to send Scott for private schooling. Scott studied law in Belleville under Kinney & Bissell. Career Admitted to the bar in 1848, Scott moved to McLean County to establish a law practice with Asahel Gridley in the Miller‚ÄìDavis Law Buildings. A year later he was elected county school commissioner, a position that he held until 1852. Scott also owned and managed several farms in the Bloomington area. He also served as Bloomington city attorney before being elected judge of the McLean County court. Scott admired the political philosophies of Daniel Webster and thus affiliated himself with the Whig Party. When the party dissolved in the 1850s, Scott became a Republican. He was nominated by the party for the Illinois Senate in 1856, but lost narrowly to William C. Goudy. In 1862, Bloomington judge David Davis was elected Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, thus creating a vacancy in the 8th Circuit Court. Scott was appointed to fill the unexpired term, then won election to a full term. In 1870, the Constitution of Illinois was amended; one of the amendments expanded the Supreme Court of Illinois. The Illinois bar convened that July and selected Scott as one of the new justices. He was re-elected by his district by a large margin in 1879, but declined to seek re-election to a third nine-year term in 1888. Scott served three times as Chief Justice (1875, 1882, and 1886). His most notable decision may have been Ker v. Illinois, upholding the conviction of a thief kidnapped by the Pinkerton Detective Agency after fleeing to Peru. The United States Supreme Court upheld his decision. In 1887 he wrote the opinion upholding several of the convictions of anarchists in the Haymarket Affair, which was also upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, despite ongoing public and historical controversy concerning the trial judge and police (with many allegations of fabricated evidence). Judge Scott also wrote a dissent in Dimick v. Chicago and Northwestern Railroad, 96 Ill. 49 (1880), disagreeing with the court's other justices followed a recent decision of the Indiana Supreme Court and allowed the railroad a new trial in a case involving a farmer killed by a no-whistle train at an unguarded and brush-obstructed road crossing on his farm. Personal life Scott married Charlotte A. Perry, the Pennsylvania-board daughter of a Presbyterian minister, in 1853. They had two children, but both died before reaching three years.https://www.cityblm.org/home/showdocument?id=22003 The Scotts adopted and raised another daughter. Judge Scott enjoyed reading in his free time and owned a large collection of books.https://www.cityblm.org/government/departments/john-m-scott Final years and death After retiring from the court, Scott traveled. He also wrote two books, and helped found the McLean County Historical Society in 1892 (and remained its president until his death). Scott died in Bloomington on January 21, 1898 and was buried in Evergreen Memorial Cemetery. His will directed that part of his estate be used to establish a hospital; the trust to support local healthcare still exists today but local courts have twice revised its terms to account for changed circumstances.https://www.cityblm.org/government/departments/john-m-scott His papers are held by the McLean Historical Society, now the McLean County Museum of History and housed since 1991 in the former 8th Circuit courthouse where Judge Scott once worked (a more modern facility having been constructed for the judiciary in 1976).

Enmegahbowh (left) with Rev. James Lloyd Breck (right) and Isaac Manitowab (center). Born around 1820, Enmegahbowh (pronounced En-meh-GAH-boe),\\"Honoring 'The One Who Stands Before His People'\\", Soundings, June 2002, Vol.24, Number 3, p. 11, Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota was the only child of the chief of an Ojibwe Band on Rice Lake near Peterborough, Canada. Because this group of Ojibwe \\"trade Indians\\" remained behind while the others pressed farther up the Great Lakes in search of furs, some consider Enmegahbowh an Ottawa.Zapffe, Carl A., \\"The life and work of Enmegahbowh: A time line\\", Soundings, June 2002, Vol.24, Number 3, p.12 He was raised in a Christian Anishinaabe (Ojibwe)Thomas, Rev. M. Lucie, \\"Enmegahbowh:Native and Christian\\", Church Divinity School of the Pacific, Berkeley, California, December 16, 1994 village near Petersburg which was affiliated with the Methodists. An Episcopal clergyman of the vicinity, Mr. Armour, persuaded Enmegahbowh's reluctant parents to send him to be educated with the clergyman's own sons. Enmegahbowh did learn to read and speak English, but after three months, the homesick boy ran away in the night and walked for two days to return to his own people. About 1831, Enmegahbowh's grandfather, a medicine man of high rank, inducted him into the tribal religious organization Midewiwin. On July 4, 1841 Enmegahbowh married Biwabikogeshigequay (a/k/a Iron Sky Woman and baptized Charlotte), niece of Hole-in-the-Day. He met the Rev. Ezekiel Gilbert Gear, chaplain at Fort Snelling at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, and became an Episcopalian. Gear eventually introduced Enmegahbowh to the Rev. James Lloyd Breck, a missionary who had arrived in Minnesota in 1851, and who baptised Enmegahbowh.Thomas, Rev. M. Lucie, Soundings, June 2002, Vol. 24, Number 3, pp. 11‚Äì13 Bishop Jackson Kemper ordained him deacon in 1859, and Enmegahbowh went to Crow Wing, Minnesota to assist in founding St. Columba Mission. Mille Lacs Chief Fine-Day was an early member of Enmegahbowh's church, and took over the mission in 1861. The Dakota War In 1821, the Sioux on the upper Minnesota River entered into two treaties with the United States government, the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and the Treaty of Mendota, which together ceded their claims to millions of acres and enabled white settlement in Minnesota. In exchange, the Sioux were to receive a reservation and annual payments totaling more than two million dollars, but ultimately received little other than a few trade goods. Most of the payments were actually made to white traders (supposedly for goods provided to the Sioux) or stolen through corruption within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. When Minnesota became a state in 1858, the tribes sent representatives to Washington, D.C. led by Little Crow to complain about not receiving the benefits negotiated in the treaty, but had little success. The land on their reservation proved not arable, and new settlement practices restricted hunting. During the Dakota War of 1862, which began as treaty payments were due for distribution to the starving Sioux at Fort Ridgely, the Gull Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa rose to attack near-by Fort Ripley. Enmegahbowh prevented other Ojibwa bands from joining the Gull Lake Band, for which the rebels imprisoned him. Enmegahbowh escaped and traveled thirty miles at night to warn Fort Ripley. This discouraged the Gull Lake Band from attacking the fort. However, many Ojibwe resented Enmegahbowh's actions for years, even though he followed his people (and the Gull Lake band and other Ojibwa) when they were removed to the environs of the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and then eventually to the White Earth Indian Reservation. In 1867 Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple ordained Enmegahbowh a priest.Neslund, Robert, \\"St. Columba's Mission, co-founded by Enmegahbowh, celebrates its sesquicentennial\\", Soundings, June 2002, Vol.24, Number 3, p.14] In 1869 he encouraged Chief White Cloud's mission to establish peace between the Ojibwe and the Sioux in 1869. In March 1880, Enmegahbowh and Chief Fine-Day traveled across the eastern United States for three months in order to raise money for a new St. Columba Episcopal Church at White Earth. While in Ohio, they impressed the governor, and also addressed the Ohio state legislature, raising $6000 for their project. After Chief Fine-Day died in 1883, Enmegahbowh referred to him as \\"our noblest chief\\" and recommended that a stained glass window in the church memorialize him. Death and legacy Enmegahbowh died at the White Earth Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota on June 12, 1902 at the age of 95, and is buried in St. Columba's churchyard. The people of St. Columba's honor him each June during the White Earth Pow- Wow. The Episcopal calendar of saints remembers Enmegahbowh on June 12. Owanah Anderson, in Jamestown Commitment: The Episcopal Church and the American Indian, states that \\"Church historians have slighted the role of an Indian man, Enmegahbowh, in chronicling the coming of Christianity to the Ojibwa of northern Minnesota. While Whipple was the broker, Enmegahbowh was the implementer. While Whipple would come to be known as Apostle to the Indians, it was Enmegahbowh who served as the bishop's enabler, loyal companion, associate, and interpreter for more than 40 years.\\" He is memorialized in the Enmegahbowh Healing and Reconciliation Station at St. Mark's Cathedral, Minneapolis.

The highway has its southern terminus at a T-intersection with SR 56 in the unincorporated community of South Bloomingville. The northern terminus of SR 664 is also at a T-intersection, this time with SR 256 on the Fairfield-Perry county line approximately north of the village of Rushville. Route description Along its way, SR 664 passes through portions of Hocking and Fairfield Counties. No segment of this highway is included as a part of the National Highway System, a network of routes identified as being most important for the country's economy, mobility and defense. History SR 664 was designated in 1937. The original routing of this highway included the current stretch of SR 374 from its southern terminus at SR 56 southeast of South Bloomingville to the eastern intersection between SR 374 and SR 664, and the present routing of SR 664 from that point to its northern terminus at SR 256 north of Rushville. After just one year, SR 664 was shortened when its southern terminus was moved to the present eastern junction of SR 374 and SR 664. This occurred as a result of SR 374 being extended from that location south along the former section of SR 664 to its present southern endpoint at SR 56. In 1946, SR 664 took on the shape that it has today. From the eastern SR 374/SR 664 junction, SR 664 was routed west concurrent with SR 374 for a distance of more than , then southwesterly along a previously un-numbered roadway to South Bloomingville and its present southern terminus at SR 56. Starting in 2011, SR 664 (along the concurrency with SR 374) was rerouted to a new alignment near the Old Man's Cave area of Hocking Hills State Park. The realignment was needed to reduce the conflict between traffic on the road and pedestrians in the vicinity of the park. The realignment opened by January 2013. The interchange at US 33 in Logan, originally a standard diamond interchange with an increasing accident rate, was reconstructed to be a double-roundabout or dumbbell interchange that opened on December 4, 2013. This type of interchange is the first constructed and opened in Ohio.

The name of the species commemorates √âdouard M√©n√©tries, the French zoologist who described the species in 1832. It is closely related to the Sardinian warbler (Curruca melanocephala) of the Mediterranean basin and is similar to it in appearance. Description The Menetries's warbler is 12 to 14 cm long with a wingspan of 15 to 19 cm and weighs about 9-11 grams. Its fairly long tail is blackish with white on the outer-feathers and is often held cocked. It is frequently wagged up and down or from side to side. The bill is fairly heavy and is dark with a pinkish patch at the base. There is a pale bare ring around the eye. The male of the nominate subspecies C. m. mystacea is dark greyish above and whitish below with a white submoustachial stripe and a pink throat and breast. It has a dark cap which is dull black at the front but becomes paler further back and merges into the grey nape unlike the Sardininan warbler which has an entirely jet-black cap. Menetries's warblers have rather plain tertial feathers unlike the Sardinian warbler which has tertials with more obvious dark centres and pale edges. The western subspecies S. m. rubescens is paler grey above than the nominate and the pink on the underparts is paler or absent entirely. The eastern subspecies C. m. turcmenica is paler grey above and paler pink below than the nominate and has longer wings than both the other subspecies. Male Menetries's warblers become browner outside the breeding season with a less dark cap. The female is sandy grey-brown above and buff-white below. It is similar to female Sardinian and subalpine warblers but has plainer tertial feathers and more contrast between the pale back and dark tail. First-winter males are similar to females but may have some pink on the throat and breast. The species has a harsh, buzzing call, as well as a sparrow-like chattering call. The song of the male is a quiet chattering, which mixes musical and harsh notes and is often given in flight. Distribution It is a migratory bird, nesting in Southwest Asia and wintering westwards in Northeast Africa. The subspecies C. m. mystacea breeds from the Caspian Sea region of Russia down through Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and easternmost Turkey to northern Iran. C. m. rubescens breeds locally in south-east Turkey, Syria, Iraq, western Iran and possibly in Lebanon. C. m. turcmenica occurs from north-east Iran eastward to the Syr Darya valley in Central Asia and the Balochistan region in Pakistan. The winter range covers southern Iran, the Arabian Peninsula and Northeast Africa, from Sudan to Somalia. A few birds pass through Israel and Jordan on migration, and vagrants have been recorded from Portugal, Nigeria and Niger. Ecology It occurs in scrub, thickets, open woodland, cultivated areas and gardens in areas with dry, continental climates. It is typically found in steppe regions, on mountain slopes and along rivers and is often associated with tamarisk bushes. It forages among leaves and branches for insects and other invertebrates, starting at the top of a bush and moving downwards. It also feeds on fruit and seeds. Reproduction The cup-shaped nest is built in low vegetation, up to 90 cm above the ground. It is made of twigs, stems and grass leaves with feathers and hair used in the lining. Four or five eggs are laid and are incubated for 11 to 13 days. They are glossy white with brown spots. The young birds fledge after 10 or 11 days. Both sexes are involved in incubating the eggs and caring for the young. They usually raise two broods during the breeding season.

My Mother, Madame Edwarda, The Dead Man. 1989: Marion Boyars. Trans. Pauvert, Jean-Jacques. Music critic Thom Jurek's interpretation is that the use of these texts by the band is \\"for the purpose of explaining the Devil not as God's mystical antithesis, but as a pure nihilistic humanist construct that is synthesis. It also offers a very concrete view of the \\"real\\" theory of Satanism as practiced in Europe.\\" On another interpretation, the album \\"represents the Bataillean quest for the ‚Äúcritical spasm,‚Äù while remaining torn as to whether or not what one has just experienced was revolting or gratifying. This pilgrimage for spiritual truth is also a metaphor for Lucifer‚Äôs fall, as well as the dematerialization of grace.\\" Further, the title of the second track 'The Shrine of Mad Laughter' is again derived from Bataille, whose \\"definition of laughter as a response to aversion and horror, and to Ecclesiastes 2:2.\\" Track listing References Category:Deathspell Omega albums Category:2007 albums ","title":"Fas ‚Äì Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum"},{"id":"11751620","text":"John or Jack Hendry or Hendrie may refer to: *John Hendry (industrialist) (1843‚Äì1916), Canadian lumber magnate *John Strathearn Hendrie (1857‚Äì1923), Canadian politician *John C.

NRK Alltid nyheter () is a Norwegian all-news radio channel operated by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). It was launched on 14 April 1997 as part of an effort to attract listeners to DAB digital radio, and was the world's first all-digital news channel. Initially the station used the same production model as ABC NewsRadio in Sydney, Australia and broadcast news every fifteen minutes, in a less formal manner than traditional radio. It had its own staff of 16 journalists who created stories based on material provided by NRK's main news division, the BBC World Service, and Sveriges Radio. In 2002 the station moved to NRK's headquarters in Marienlyst, Oslo, where other NRK news output is produced. Although the channel had been set up with the aim of attracting listeners to DAB, it was later decided that early DAB coverage was too low, and parallel broadcasting on FM was begun in 17 of the largest Norwegian cities and towns. These FM transmissions were withdrawn in line with the planned switch-off of analogue radio in Norway, which started in January 2017, now that DAB+ transmissions can be received by 99.7% of the population.EBU: Norwegian analogue switch-off By 13 December 2017 all NRK national stations had transitioned to DAB+ transmissions only. In 2002 the station became part of NRK's news division. Alongside its own productions, NRK Alltid nyheter today rebroadcasts full programmes from other NRK stations and the audio from NRK's early-evening tv news programme Dagsrevyen. Overnight (from 22.00 to 6.30 on weekdays, longer at weekends) the station relays the BBC World Service in English. On weekdays Alltid nyheter also airs a special edition of Ekot ‚Äì 15 minutes of news in Swedish from Sveriges Radio (30 minutes on Fridays) ‚Äì and further BBC World Service content is rebroadcast as part of the daytime schedule at weekends.

The cooks/caterers guild - informally known as the traiteurs - progressively claimed the right to make any sophisticated meals, leaving inns and taverns to mainly make roast or grilled meat. As of the late seventeenth century, many offered a table d'h√¥te, a meal offered at a set price with no choice of dishes.Spang, 30-31. However both cabarets and traiteurs could also offer individual choice of dishes, despite claims to the contrary. As for the etymology of the word, traiteur is an agent noun formed from the verb traiter (\\"treat\\"), which literally refers to the action of \\"treating\\" someone to something (for instance, a meal). The root of the verb is Latin tractare (\\"manage, handle\\"), a frequentative of trahere (\\"pull, draw\\"):http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=treat The verb \\"treat\\" in the Online Etymology Dictionary in ancient times, for example, Latins used the expression littera tractoria (roughly rendered as \\"treatment letter\\") to indicate a document the envoys of a prince would be given to receive food, accommodation and means of transport in the lands they would pass by, so to get a full treatment along their way.Pianigiani, origin and meaning of the noun \\"trattore\\". This Latin root originated both French traiteur and Italian trattoria. Present-day traiteurs Today in France, a traiteur is a catering business devoted to take-out food and service of banquets. Many traiteurs also undertake home delivery. Generally there is no seating on the business premises; a few traiteurs may have very limited seating. Especially in market towns where there is competition, traiteurs take great pride in the beauty of their window displays. Traiteur 'departments' are now common in supermarch√©s, the equivalent of the US/UK delicatessen. The staple of this type of business is an array of salads, cold meat and seafood dishes. In France today, it is a 900 million-euro business involving 1,250 companies.Fed√®le, P. et Bravo, E.

It bears an imprecise date: the 5th day of the Macedonian month of Panemos, in the year 78 of king Moga. It is thought it may be related to the establishment of a Maues era, which would give a date around 6 CE. The copper plate is written in the Kharosthi script (a script derived from Aramaic). It relates the dedication of a relic of the Buddha Shakyamuni (Pali: ≈õakamuni, literally \\"Master of the Shakas\\") to a Buddhist monastery by the Indo-Scythian (Pali: \\"≈õaka\\") ruler Patika Kusulaka, son of Liaka Kusulaka, satrap of Chukhsa, near Taxila.

Nashville Lifestyles Magazine recently named Robert as the #2 in the top 100 Reasons to Love Nashville, describing him as Nashville's \\"Master of Ceremonies\\". Early life and arts background Robert Hicks was born and raised in South Florida. He moved to Williamson County, Tennessee in 1974 and lives near the Bingham Community at \\"Labor in Vain,\\" his late-eighteenth-century log cabin. Working over the years as a music publisher and in artist management in both country and alternative-rock music, Hicks's interests have remained varied. A partner in the B. B. King's Blues Clubs in Nashville, Memphis, Orlando and Los Angeles, Hicks serves as \\"Curator of Vibe\\" for the corporation. A lifelong collector, Hicks was the first Tennessean to be listed among Art & Antiquess Top 100 Collectors in America ‚Äì- his collection focuses on outsider art by artists such as Howard Finster and B.F.Perkins, Tennesseana, and Southern Material Culture. He served as curator on the exhibition, Art of Tennessee, at the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville. The exhibition was a seven-year endeavor from conception at his kitchen table to its opening, September 2003. He was co-editor of the exhibition's award-winning and critically acclaimed catalog, Art of Tennessee.University of Tennessee Press, September 2003 Historic preservation In the field of historic preservation, he has served on the boards of the Tennessee State Museum, The Williamson County Historical Society, and the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He presently serves on the board of directors of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans and of Historic Carnton Plantation in Franklin, Tennessee. In December 1997, after a third term as President of the Carnton board, and in light of his years of service to the site, Hicks was named by board resolution: \\"the driving force in the restoration and preservation of Historic Carnton Plantation.\\" He is founding chairman emeritus of \\"Franklin's Charge: A Vision and Campaign for the Preservation of Historic Open Space\\" in the fight to secure and preserve both battlefield and other historic open space in Williamson County. Franklin's Charge took on the massive mission of saving what remains of the eastern flank of the battlefield at Franklin -‚Äì the largest remaining undeveloped fragment of the battlefield -‚Äì and turning it into a public battlefield park. The American Battlefield Protection Program has called this endeavor \\"the largest battlefield reclamation in North American history.\\" By the end of 2005, Franklin's Charge had already raised over 5 million dollars toward this goal, surpassing anything ever done within any other community in America to preserve battlefield open space. As Jim Lighthizer, President of the Civil War Preservation Trust has said, \\"There is no 'close second' in any community in America, to what Robert Hicks and Franklin's Charge has done in Franklin.\\" The Governor named Hicks as a commissioner to plan out the 150th Anniversary of the Civil War in Tennessee. Novels The Widow of the South Hicks became fascinated by the Battle of Franklin, Tennessee, a major battle which occurred in the final months of the Civil War. During his many years working at Carnton, he began to develop a book idea, and during an accidental meeting with civil war historian and author Shelby Foote, he received further encouragement to complete a historic novel about the battle.Speech given by Robert Hicks in Clarksville, Tennessee on June 8, 2007, as keynote speaker to the Clarksville Writers Conference, 2007 sponsored by the Arts and Heritage Development Council, concerning his meeting with Shelby Foote. The result was Hicks' first novel, The Widow of the South.Warner Books, NY, 2005 In writing the novel, he hoped to bring national attention back to this moment in American history, the impact those five bloody hours played in making us a nation, and in the preservation of the sites tied to the story. The Widow of the South was launched September 1, 2005 to overwhelming critical success, entering the New York Times Bestseller List after only one week out. The novel is centered around the Carnton Plantation and mansion which was commandeered by officers of the Confederate States Army as a hospital during the Battle of Franklin II. Hicks creates a cast of characters including the Madame of the mansion and soldiers wounded during this monumental battle. The novel has been critically acclaimed as comparable to other literary works on the Civil War including Gone with the Wind, and The Killer Angels.Informational brochure produced by the Arts and Heritage Development Council In December 2005, Nashville's The Tennessean named him \\"Tennessean of the Year\\" for the impact The Widow of the South had on Tennessee, heritage tourism and preservation. A Separate Country Hicks' second novel, A Separate CountryGrand Central Publishing/Hachette/North America was released on September 23, 2009. The novel is set in New Orleans in the years after the Civil War. It is based on the incredible life of John Bell Hood, arguably one of the most controversial generals of the Confederate Army‚Äîand one of its most tragic figures. Robert E. Lee promoted him to major general after the Battle of Antietam. But the Civil War would mark him forever. At Gettysburg, he lost the use of his left arm. At the Battle of Chickamauga, his right leg was amputated. Starting fresh after the war, he married Anna Marie Hennen and fathered 11 children with her, including three sets of twins. But fate had other plans. Crippled by his war wounds and defeat, ravaged by financial misfortune, Hood had one last foe to battle: yellow fever. Other writings and presentations Hicks's essays on regional history, southern material culture, furniture and music have appeared in numerous publications over the years. Hicks now writes op-eds for The New York Times on contemporary politics in the South. He is also a regular contributor to Garden & Gun. He travels, throughout the nation, speaking on a variety of topics ranging from \\"Why The South Matters to The Importance of Fiction in Preserving History to Southern Material Culture\\" to \\"A Model for the Preservation of Historic Open Space for Every Community\\". Hicks's first book, a collaboration with French-American photographer Michel Arnaud, came out in 2000: Nashville: the Pilgrims of Guitar Town.Stewart, Tabori & Chang He is co-editor (with Justin Stelter and John Bohlinger) of a collection of short stories, A Guitar and A Pen: Short Stories and Story-Songs By Nashville Songwriters.Center Street Books/Hachette, North America, released in April 2008 He has also written the introduction to two books on historic preservation authored by photographer, Nell Dickerson: GONE: A Photographic Plea for Preservation Photographs by Nell Dickerson.

About his decision to release Battlefield Bourbon he said, \\"My decision to only produce 1,864 bottles of Battlefield Bourbon this year makes it pretty much the smallest batch of small batch bourbon anywhere. Yet, it only seemed right as I promised myself that whatever I produced would be really good and really rare. Besides, as I am signing and numbering every bottle, I figured that I needed to protect the old signing hand and 1,864 bottles seemed like enough. Of course, 1864 is the year of the Battle of Franklin, which this sesquicentennial commemoration is all about.\\" References External links *The Carnton Plantation website *Brief Bio on Robert Hicks *Hachette Book Group website for A Separate Country *Robert Hicks website *Franklin's Charge website *B.

Named after counties in 12 states, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-731 was laid down on 27 December 1943 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the Dravo Corporation of Neville Island; launched on 12 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. A. J. Ackerman; and commissioned on 30 March 1944 with Ensign K. S. McCann, Jr., in command. Service history During World War II, LST-731 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater and participated in the following operations: capture and occupation of Guam (July and August, 1944), and assault and occupation of Iwo Jima (February and March, 1945). Following the war, LST-731 was redesignated hospital ship LSTH-731 on 15 September 1945 and performed occupation duty in the Far East until mid- February, 1946. She was decommissioned on 2 June 1950 and redesignated LST-731 on 6 March 1952. The ship received the name USS Douglas County (LST-731) on 1 July 1955 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1958. Her final fate is unknown. LST-731 earned two battle stars for World War II service.

It results from the failure of myocardial development during embryogenesis. During development, the majority of the heart muscle is a sponge-like meshwork of interwoven myocardial fibers. As normal development progresses, these trabeculated structures undergo significant compaction that transforms them from spongy to solid. This process is particularly apparent in the ventricles, and particularly so in the left ventricle. Noncompaction cardiomyopathy results when there is failure of this process of compaction. Because the consequence of non-compaction is particularly evident in the left ventricle, the condition is also called left ventricular noncompaction. Other hypotheses and models have been proposed, none of which is as widely accepted as the noncompaction model. Symptoms range greatly in severity. Most are a result of a poor pumping performance by the heart. The disease can be associated with other problems with the heart and the body. Signs and symptoms Subjects' symptoms from non-compaction cardiomyopathy range widely. It is possible to be diagnosed with the condition, yet not to have any of the symptoms associated with heart disease. Likewise it possible to have severe heart failure, which even though the condition is present from birth, may only manifest itself later in life. Differences in symptoms between adults and children are also prevalent with adults more likely to have heart failure and children from depression of systolic function. Common symptoms associated with a reduced pumping performance of the heart include: * Breathlessness * Fatigue * Swelling of the ankles * Limited physical capacity and exercise intolerance Two conditions though that are more prevalent in noncompaction cardiomyopathy are: tachyarrhythmia which can lead to sudden cardiac death and clotting of the blood in the heart. Complications The presence of NCC can also lead to other complications around the heart and elsewhere in the body. These are not necessarily common complications and no paper has yet commented on how frequently these complicationcs occur with NCC as well. Genetics The American Heart Association's 2006 classification of cardiomyopathies considers noncompaction cardiomyopathy a genetic cardiomyopathy. Mutations in LDB3 (also known as \\"Cypher/ZASP\\") have been described in patients with the condition. There is recent information in which NCC has been seen in combination with 1q21.1 deletion Syndrome.A publication is expected by Leiden University Medical Centre Furthermore mutations in Titin (TTN), RBM20 and also LMNA could be detected in a large cohort of LVNC patients. In addition, a small in-frame deletion was identified in the DES gene, encoding the intermediate filament protein desmin. Diagnosis Trabeculation of the ventricles is normal, as are prominent, discrete muscular bundles greater than 2mm. In non-compaction there are excessively prominent trabeculations. Echocardiography is the reference standard for diagnosing NCC, although it can be well defined by computer tomography scan, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Chin, et al., described echocardiographic method to distinguish non- compaction from normal trabeculation. They described a ratio of the distance from the trough and peak, of the trabeculations, to the epicardial surface. Non-compaction is diagnosed when the trabeculations are more than twice the thickness of the underlying ventricular wall. Image:Cardiovasc Ultrasound LVNC 1.jpg|Two-dimensional apical four chamber and parasternal short axis images at the level of the ventricles show dilatation of both ventricles, multiple trabeculae and intertrabecular recesses in inferior, lateral, anterior walls, middle and apical portions of the septum and apex of the left ventricle.

Image:Cardiovasc Ultrasound LVNC 4.jpg|Two-dimensional parasternal and color Doppler images at the level of both ventricles that show the noncompacted:compacted wall ratio and how the color enters the intertrabecular recesses Differential diagnosis In a study (2006) carried out on 53 patients with the condition in Mexico, 42 had been diagnosed with another form of heart disease and only in the most recent 11 cases that ventricular noncompation was diagnosed and this took several echocardiograms to confirm. The most common misdiagnoses were: * dilated cardiomyopathy: 30 Cases * congenital heart disease: 6 Cases * ischemic heart disease: 2 Cases * disease of the heart valves: 2 Cases * dilated phase hypertensive cardiomyopathy: 1 Case * restrictive cardiomyopathy: 1 Case The high number of misdiagnoses can be attributed to non-compaction cardiomyopathy being first reported in 1990; diagnosis is therefore often overlooked or delayed. Advances in medical imaging equipment have made it easier to diagnose the condition, particularly with the wider use of MRIs. Management One paper has listed the various types of management of care that have been used for various types of NCC. These are similar to management programs for other types of cardiomyopathies which include the use of ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and aspirin therapy to relieve the pressure on the heart, surgical options such as the installation of pacemaker is also an option for those thought to be at a high risk of arrhythmia problems. In severe cases, where NCC has led to heart failure, with resulting surgical treatment including a heart valve operation, or a heart transplant. Prognosis Due to non- compaction cardiomyopathy being a relatively new disease, its impact on human life expectancy is not very well understood. In a 2005 study that documented the long-term follow-up of 34 patients with NCC, 35% had died at the age of 42 +/- 40 months, with a further 12% having to undergo a heart transplant due to heart failure. However, this study was based upon symptomatic patients referred to a tertiary-care center, and so were suffering from more severe forms of NCC than might be found typically in the population. Sedaghat- Hamedani et al. also showed the clinical course of symptomatic LVNC can be severe. In this study cardiovascular events were significantly more frequent in LVNC patients compared with an age-matched group of patients with non- ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). As NCC is a genetic disease, immediate family members are being tested as a precaution, which is turning up more supposedly healthy people with NCC who are asymptomatic. The long-term prognosis for these people is currently unknown. Epidemiology Due to its recent establishment as a diagnosis, and it being unclassified as a cardiomyopathy according to the WHO, it is not fully understood how common the condition is. Some reports suggest that it is in the order of 0.12 cases per 100,000. The low number of reported cases though is due to the lack of any large population studies into the disease and have been based primarily upon patients suffering from advanced heart failure. A similar situation occurred with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which was initially considered very rare; however is now thought to occur in one in every 500 people in the population. Again due to this condition being established as a diagnosis recently, there are ongoing discussions as to its nature, and to various points such as the ratio of compacted to non-compacted at different age stages. However it is universally understood that non-compaction cardiomyopathy will be characterized anatomically by deep trabeculations in the ventricular wall, which define recesses communicating with the main ventricular chamber. Major clinical correlates include systolic and diastolic dysfunction, associated at times with systemic embolic events. History Non-compaction cardiomyopathy was first identified as an isolated condition in 1984 by Engberding and Benber. They reported on a 33-year-old female presenting with exertional dyspnea and palpitations. Investigations concluded persistence of myocardial sinusoids (now termed non-compaction). Prior to this report, the condition was only reported in association with other cardiac anomalies, namely pulmonary or aortic atresia. Myocardial sinusoids is considered not an accurate term as endothelium lines the intertrabecular recesses.

They first appeared under Pepin the Short in 741 and became ubiquitous at monasteries throughout the empire in the following decades. They were not official court annals, but they often bear the bias of having been written in one regnum or another. The Reichsannalen are distinguished from earlier and later classes of annals by their coverage of supranational and not just local events; they covered the entire empire. Though usually composed at monasteries, they are contrasted with monastic annals which emphasise ecclesiastical and especially local happenings over those of the larger Reich. Some historians, such as Ranke (Zur Kritik fr√§nkisch-deutscher Reichsannalisten. Berlin, 1854) have seen a sheen of officiality in the various annals for the kings whose reigns they cover. The authors of the Reichsannalen show a greater awareness of external affairs, military man≈ìuvres, and court politics than the cloistered penmen of the monastic annals. The earliest of the annals is the Royal Frankish Annals, dating from 741. For information before that date, the Chronicon Universale (MGH: Scriptores, XIII, 1-19) was drawn up about 761. The Chronicon contains information derived from Bede, Fredegar, Isidore of Seville, the Liber Pontificalis, the Annales Mosellani, and the Annales Laureshamenses. During the reign of Charlemagne, Reichsannalen proliferate: the Annales Laurissenses minores (c.806), the Annales Maximiani (810-811) and the Annals of Flavigny (816) crop up. The Annales Fuldenses, the most famous of them all, appear in the reign of Louis the Pious. They have a regional, East Frankish character, but purport to record national events. The author must certainly have been in touch with the court. They cover the period from in 711 until 901 with information drawn from the Annales Laurissenses minores, the Royal Frankish Annals, and the official Annales Lithienses. The counterpart of the Fuldenses is the Annales Bertiniani in West Francia, of a more universal character and probably more objective. They form the source for the Chronicon de gestis Normannorum in Franci√¢. In Lotharingia, the Annales Vedastini appear and form the basis for the Chronicon Vedastinum, a universal chronicle continuing until 899.

Martin believed witches (sorginak) to be particularly numerous among the population of Navarra, and the Basques of the Pyrenees in general. He recommends stern measures of an inquisition against this. His depiction of witchcraft is, however, based on sources predating the Malleus maleficarum, arguing against its simplistic depiction of witchcraft (falsa opinione [...] credentes cum Diana vel Herodia nocturnis horis equitare, vel se in alias creaturas transformare). The work was printed in Paris in 1517, and in Rome in 1559 (142 sextodecimo pages). The work was not widely received and is now very difficult to find. Nicolas R√©my in his 1595 Demonolatry writes: :\\"I am aware that Peter of Palude and Martin of Arles have said that when demons go about this work, they, as it were, milk the semen from the bodies of dead men; but this is as ridiculous as the proverbial dead donkey's fart.\\" (trans.

He developed the innovative use of a layered cardboard printing matrix that could be carved like a woodcut, enabling the inexpensive creation of large-scale works. Early life Casarella was born in Newark, New Jersey on September 3, 1920 to an ethnic Italian family. His family moved to Brooklyn, where he attended local schools. He graduated from Cooper Union College in 1942. He became a mentor to Vincent Longo, a younger boy in the neighborhood who was interested in art and followed Casarella to Cooper Union.Mark Segal, \\"Vincent Longo: Squaring the Circle\\", The East Hampton Star, 26 November 2014, accessed 26 February 2016 Longo also became an artist, and has worked chiefly as a painter since the late 20th century. Career Casarella was hired by printmaker Anthony Velonis, who during the 1930s had led the Federal Arts Project in New York and expanded silk-screen printing as a fine art process.Warrington Colescott, Arthur Hove, Progressive Printmakers: Wisconsin Artists and the Print Renaissance, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1999, p. 5 Velonis was commissioned to write a pamphlet on this technique, Technical Problems of the Artist: Technique of the Silk Screen Process (1938), which was distributed to WPA art centers across the country. It was very influential in encouraging artists to try this process.Sylvie Covey, Modern Printmaking: A Guide to Traditional and Digital Techniques, Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony, 2016, p. 38 The New Deal program created employment opportunities for artists. In the 1940s, Velonis continued to lead Creative Printmakers Group in New York, which he had co-founded in 1939. Casarella printed serigraphs at this studio. The following year Casarella created the poster for the 1943 exhibition, Artists for Victory. Casarella joined the U.S. Army in 1944 and fought in Europe during World War II. After his discharge, he studied under the GI Bill at the Brooklyn Museum School from 1949 to 1951, including printmaking with Gabor Peterdi. Casarella made his first paper relief print in about 1948. He continued to experiment with the medium throughout his career and developed a way of layering cardboard in order to cut it like a woodcut - an inexpensive way to produce large-scale works. His work was shown in 1949 at the Laurel Gallery in New York. In 1952 he was represented by Margaret Lowengrund's Contemporaries Gallery. In 1953, Casarella and Vincent Longo had their work shown in a joint exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. That same year Casarella's work was included in the Young American Printmakers exhibition at the New York Museum of Modern Art. In 1962, he was included in the widely traveled exhibition, American Prints Today. Casarella received a Fulbright Fellowship in 1951, a Tiffany Award in 1955, and a Guggenheim Foundation Grant in 1960. These awards enabled him to travel for study and work throughout Italy and Greece. Casarella returned to the Brooklyn Museum to teach art classes from 1955 to 1960. During the 1960s, he shifted from printmaking to creating works of sculpture. He taught courses at the Art Students' League and Hunter College, with additional temporary teaching positions at the Pratt Institute, Yale University, Rutgers University and Columbia University. From 1969 to 1975, he taught at Cooper Union and Finch College in New York City. Works Casarella was accepted as an Academician of the National Academy of Design. His prints, paintings and sculpture were included in a score of exhibitions in the United States and Eastern Europe. His work is represented in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Library of Congress, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Worcester Art Museum, the Speed Art Museum, the Chazen Museum of Art, the Green National Museum in Athens, and the Australian National Museum in Canberra. Casarella died on February 13, 1996 in Englewood, New Jersey.

She was David Phillips Professor of Molecular Biophysics at the University of Oxford from 1990 to 2007, and later an emeritus professor. Education Johnson attended Wimbledon High School for Girls from 1952 to 1959, where girls were encouraged to study science and to pursue useful careers. Her mother had read biochemistry and physiology at University College London in the 1930s and was supportive of Johnson's decision to pursue a scientific career. She went to University College London in 1959 to read Physics and coming from an all-girls school, she was surprised to find herself one of only four girls in a class of 40. She took theoretical physics as her third-year option and graduated with a 2.1 degree. Whilst working at the Atomic Energy Authority, Harwell, on neutron diffraction, during one of her vacations, she met Dr Uli Arndt, an instrument scientist, who worked at the Royal Institution, London. She was impressed by the work taking place there and in 1962 she moved to the Royal Institution to do a PhD in biophysics. Her graduate supervisor was David Chilton Phillips, whose team was working on the crystal structure of lysozyme. Her first task was to determine the structure of a sugar molecule, N-Acetylglucosamine, using x-ray diffraction, which she solved within a year. She then moved onto the study of the substrate binding to the protein lysozyme and was part of the team, that discovered the structure of the enzyme lysozyme; this was the third protein structure ever solved by x-ray crystallography, and the first enzyme. She was awarded her PhD in 1965. Career After her PhD, she moved to the laboratory of Frederic M. Richards at Yale University for postdoctoral research in 1966. At Yale she worked as part of a team with Frederic M. Richards and Hal Wyckoff on the crystal structure of another enzyme, ribonuclease, which was solved shortly after she left: the fourth protein structure solved.Louise N. Johnson, \\"Clever Women\\", unpublished autobiographical notes, deposited with the papers of L.N. Johnson, at the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford. After her post-doctoral year at Yale, she returned to the UK in 1967 and took up the post of Departmental Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford. The Professor of Zoology, J.W.R. Pringle, saw zoology as extending from animal studies to molecular studies, and had been partly responsible for bringing David Phillips to Oxford as Professor of Molecular Biophysics. Johnson was able to combine teaching with independent research and continued her work on lysozyme and new crystal studies on other enzymes. In 1972 she received some crystals of glycogen phosphorylase and this was the beginning of a major chapter in her research career. She began a detailed x-ray crystallographic analysis of the protein, which was eight times larger than lysozyme and much larger than any of the other proteins whose structures had been solved at that time. In 1973 she was appointed University Lecturer, a post which was associated with Somerville College, Oxford. She became an Additional Fellow of the college and the Janet Vaughan Lecturer. She was now able to expand her team of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. The phosphorylase work developed and by 1978 the team had discovered its structure and were able to work on its biological control properties. Glycogen phosphorylase is found in muscle and is responsible for mobilising the energy store of glycogen to provide fuel to sustain muscle contraction. In resting muscle the enzyme is switched off to prevent wasteful degradation of the fuel but in response to nervous or hormonal signals the enzyme is switched on almost simultaneously to generate the energy supply. Her research was directed towards understanding the molecular basis of the biological properties of control and catalytic mechanism. Her team used the bright x-ray source generated at the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury, which provided data that could not be obtained with the home source. She was David Phillips Professor in Molecular Biophysics, University of Oxford, in 1990‚Äì2007. Johnson's lab at Oxford solved and studied many other protein structures, and she is a depositor on 100 PDB entries including many forms of glycogen phosphorylase and of cell cycle CDK/cyclin complexes As well as carrying out cutting-edge research, she nurtured numerous careers, training a generation of crystallographers in Oxford who themselves now train future leaders across the world. Together with Tom Blundell, she wrote an influential textbook on protein crystallography. She was Director of Life Sciences at Diamond Light Source, 2003‚Äì2008, and was a Fellow of Diamond Light Source, 2008‚Äì2012. Diamond Light Source is the UK's national synchrotron facility at Harwell, Oxfordshire.Diamond Light Source. Honours She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2003. She was a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and an Honorary Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford.

His family moved to New Zealand in 1924. He had about \\"seven years of formal schooling\\" in England, Scotland and New Zealand before getting work at 15. His first job was as a radio mechanic. In 1936 he emigrated to Australia, working in commercial radio, and then the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He then did army service, returned to ABC, and resigned spending a year in the Northern Territory, becoming a freelance writer. Hart-Smith was connected with the Jindyworobak Movement and had some of his work, such as Columbus Goes West (1943), published by them. However he spent only a decade in Australia, returning to New Zealand in 1946. From 1948 to 1954 he taught in adult education. He spent several years in Perth from the late 1960s, associating with younger poets including Andrew Lansdown, Hal Colebatch and Lee Knowles. He was a prolific writer of poetry into old age, though many of his later poems have never been collected. He was also a distinguished conchologist, specialising in classifying cowrie shells. He said he had come to Perth from Sydney to find unpolluted water for shelling. He was awarded the ALS Gold Medal in 1960, and won the Patrick White Award in 1987. He died in 1990.

As with many screw- pile structures, it had several run-ins with ice, with several pilings being damaged in its first winter. It was threatened again in 1879, but escaped further damage.

As is expected from the prefix milli-, a millioctave is defined as 1/1000 of an octave. From this it follows that one millioctave is equal to the ratio 21/1000, the 1000th root of 2, or approximately 1.0006934 (). Given two frequencies a and b, the measurement of the interval between them in millioctaves can be calculated by :n = 1000 \\\\log_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{a}{b} \\\\right) \\\\approx 3322 \\\\log_{10} \\\\left( \\\\frac{a}{b} \\\\right) Likewise, if you know a note b and the number n of millioctaves in the interval, then the other note a may be calculated by: :a = b \\\\times 2 ^ \\\\frac{n}{1000} Like the more common cent, the millioctave is a linear measure of intervals, and thus the size of intervals can be calculated by adding their millioctave values, instead of multiplication, which is necessary for calculations of frequencies. A millioctave is exactly 1.2 cents.  History and use  The millioctave was introduced by the German physicist Arthur von Oettingen in his book Das duale Harmoniesystem (1913). The invention goes back to John Herschel, who proposed a division of the octave into 1000 parts, which was published (with appropriate credit to Herschel) in George Biddell Airy's book on musical acoustics. Compared to the cent, the millioctave has not been as popular because it is not aligned with just intervals. It is however occasionally used by authors who wish to avoid the close association between the cent and twelve-tone equal temperament. Some considers that the millioctave introduces as well a bias for the less familiar 10-tone equal temperament however this bias is common in the decimal system.

The plaza occupies part of a block in the downtown area, limited by San Luis St., a pedestrian segment of San Mart√≠n St., and a smaller street or passage called Bar√≥n de Mau√°. Most of the block is taken up by the Bernardino Rivadavia Culture Center. History The site of the plaza was a marketplace between 1857 and 1903. A better organized fruit and vegetable market replaced it around 1905, which lasted there until 1962, when mayor C√°ndido Carballo ordered its removal for sanitary reasons, in 1962. The buildings were demolished, leaving an empty lot. The Autom√≥vil Club Argentino struck an agreement with the Municipality to build a car park underground, while the ground area was turned into a hardscape public space called Plaza Emidgio Pinasco.

It was founded in 1946 by actor Juliusz Osterwa, who took the initial steps leading to the establishment of the Academy through the amalgamation of three local studios; Stary Teatr, the S≈Çowacki Theatre, and Iwo Gall's Dramatic Studio. __TOC__ History The history of the Ludwik Solski Academy began in 1946 with a three-year training course in drama for prospective actors. In 1949 the name of the school was changed to the State College of Acting (Pa≈Ñstwowa Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Aktorska), and the curriculum extended to four years. Its current name, the Pa≈Ñstwowa Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Teatralna, was determined in 1955. From 1954 to 1964 the college also provided courses in puppetry and the puppet theatre, reactivated in 1972 as an independent Puppet Theatre Faculty located in the city of Wroc≈Çaw. The new Faculty of Directing was created in 1955 and continued in its original form till 1962. In 1973 the Faculty was re-established as the Faculty of Play Directing with several students pursuing a four-year programme. The next important stage in the development of the Academy was the establishment in 1979 of the Actors' Faculty in Wroc≈Çaw. In October 2017 the name of the school was changed to the AST National Academy of Theatre Arts in Krak√≥w. The academy patron was also changed. Currently the patron is a playwright, painter and poet Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski (Akademia Sztuk Teatralnych im. Stanis≈Çawa Wyspia≈Ñskiego w Krakowie). From its beginnings the Academy for the Dramatic Arts was run by some of the most prominent Polish dramatic artists, Juliusz Osterwa, Tadeusz Burnatowicz, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wo≈∫nik, Eugeniusz Fulde, Bronis≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski, Jerzy Krasowski, Danuta Micha≈Çowska, Jerzy Trela, and Jerzy Stuhr. The Academy's history was shaped by outstanding teachers and trainers as well as by famous theoreticians, including its own graduates who have made a substantial impact on the theatre scene in Poland and abroad. The following celebrities have also conducted practical classes in acting, directing and music: Jerzy Jarocki, Tadeusz Kantor, Mieczys≈Çaw Kotlarczyk, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Krzemi≈Ñski, Ewa Lasek, Krystian Lupa, Krzysztof Penderecki, Anna Polony, Krystyna Skuszanka, Marta Stebnicka, Konrad Swinarski, and Roman Zawistowski. Many of these artists are still teaching at the Academy. The most important directors in the last two decades have been predominantly graduates of the school: in the 1990s these included Krystian Lupa and Mikolaj Grabowski's students Krzysztof Warlikowski, Grzegorz Jarzyna, Anna Augustynowicz and Pawe≈Ç Miskiewicz, and in the 2000s (decade), directors Maja Kleczewska, Jan Klata and Michal Zadara. Some of the Academy's more outstanding graduates in its first decade included Zbigniew Cybulski, Jerzy Grotowski, Leszek Herdegen, Gustaw Holoubek, Jerzy Jarocki, Bogumi≈Ç Kobiela, and Halina Miko≈Çajska, while subsequent decades produced further prominent alumni: Jerzy Bi≈Ñczycki, Teresa Budzisz-Krzy≈ºanowska, Ewa Demarczyk, Jan Nowicki, Jan Peszek, Anna Polony, Maciej Prus, Wojciech Pszoniak, Anna Seniuk, Jerzy Stuhr, and Marek Walczewski. Many of its students and graduates have been involved with the emergence of new dramatic initiatives, such as the establishment of Teatr STU and the Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz Theatre in Zakopane. From its early years the Ludwik Solski Academy was a source of continuity for the Polish theatre thanks to the fact that its teaching staff often belonged to different generations including actors from before the Second World War, with many of them (i.e. Tadeusz Burnatowicz, Halina Gallowa, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Krzemi≈Ñski, Wac≈Çaw Nowakowski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wo≈∫nik) completing drama courses in prewar Poland. Close ties with the local theatre scene defined the unique character of the school from the very start. This uniqueness has been maintained even during the difficult period of the 1950s, when the authorities and the Soviet training model Monika Mokrzycka-Pokora, \\"The Ludwik Solski State Theatre School\\" at culture.pl barred students from active participation in professional theatre. The directives of the Stalinist Ministry of Culture marked the introduction of Socialist Realism in a schematic and vulgarized way. The repertoire of the Academy was narrowed down mostly to Russian and Soviet drama with no contemporary Western plays whatsoever. The repressive political climate lasted until after the Polish October of 1956. Close links to the leading theatres in Krak√≥w contribute to the Academy's status.

Biography He was born in Altenburg, where his father, Johann Ernst Witt, was court organist; he had come from Denmark around 1650 when a Danish princess married into the house of Saxe- Altenburg. Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg probably gave Witt a scholarship in 1676 to study in Vienna and Salzburg, and then from 1685‚Äì1686 to study composition and counterpoint in Nuremberg with Georg Caspar Wecker, returning for a further period of study in 1688. He moved to Gotha to take up a post as chamber organist to the court in June 1686; he remained there for the rest of his life. He became a substitute for W.M. Mylius, the kapellmeister, in 1694, and succeeded him after his death in 1713; Duke Frederick II was one of his pupils. He is mentioned as a good keyboard player and kapellmeister in J.P. Treiber's Der accurate Organist im General-Bass (1704) and Telemann's Beschreibung der Augen-Orgel (1739). He was also valued by the courts of Ansbach-Bayreuth, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, and Saxe- Weissenfels. While on Witt's deathbed, Johann Sebastian Bach was commissioned to substitute for him and perform a Passiontide work for the court chapel (the Weimarer Passion BWV deest (BC D 1)). Compositions Vocal His cantatas feature instrumental introductions, vocal concerto movements, solos, duets, homophonic chorale choruses, and are without recitatives. Psalmodia sacra is an important hymnal from the late baroque; Marpurg wrote that it was the best he knew. It contains 762 hymns, 351 with melodies and figured basses, and an appendix of 12 more hymns and five more melodies. There are established chorale melodies by sixteenth and seventeenth century Thuringian composers along with over 100 new ones believed to have been written by Witt. *65 cantatas: Rentweinsdorf cycle, for 4 voices, 2 violins, 2 viols, continuo; other instruments include clarino, bassoon, and violone *12 cantatas *Funeral ode: Wer kan des H√∂chsten Rath, for 5 voices (1697) *Psalmodia sacra, oder And√§chtige und sch√∂ne Ges√§nge: (trans, \\"Holy Praisings or Devout and Beautiful songs\\") 356 melodies, of which about 100 are by Witt, for voice and continuo (1715) Orchestral *3 ouvertures in the French style *3 suites, a 4‚Äì6 *7 sonatas, a 4‚Äì7, 10 - in an Italian concerto grosso style, including a 3-part concertino *3 marches, a 4, ed.

Before and after the war she was USC&GSS; Pathfinder (OSS-30) for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, named after the USC&GSS; Pathfinder (1899-1941) that had surveyed and was lost in the Philippines at Corregidor. Pathfinder ended her service 23 December 1971 as she and the Coast and Geodetic Survey itself had come the National Ocean Survey under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Construction  Pathfinder was built by the Lake Washington Shipyard of Houghton, Washington with her keel laid 20 February 1941, christened by Eleanor Roosevelt Boettinger, granddaughter of the president, launched 11 January 1942 and completed 31 August 1942 with armament as a request by Navy as the ship's transfer had been approved by Department of Commerce before completion. The ship had been completed at a cost of $1,265,448 which was slightly under estimated costs. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy and commissioned 31 August 1942, with Capt. Bascom H. Thomas, USNR, in command.  U.S. Navy service  A sea-going arm of the U.S. Navy's Hydrographic Office, Pathfinder spent the war years paving the way for amphibious invasion. After shakedown in the Puget Sound area of Washington and a stop at San Francisco, Pathfinder got under way 10 November 1942 and proceeded via Pearl Harbor and Palmyra Island to the Ellice Islands arriving Funa Futi 26 December. For nearly two years Pathfinder operated along the dangerous New Guinea-New Britain-Solomon Islands areas allied land-air-sea forces fought to break the Japanese grip on the area. An isolated reef, an uncharted harbor, a lonely stretch of enemy hold coastline‚Äîeach presented a different problem. At Bougainville, Treasury Island, Green Island, Emirau and Guam, advance Pathfinder parties were sent ashore under the noses of the Japanese to work in close cooperation with Allied amphibious elements in laying out harbor charts or surveying inland channels. During most of 1943, the ship operated in the Solomons and neighboring groups; the Russell Islands, Admiralties, Loyalties, and New Caledonia. Pathfinder, although nominally a noncombatant, experienced some fifty bombing raids while working close to the front lines. She showed that she could retaliate at Guadalcanal 7 April 1943 when her antiaircraft gunners shot down two Japanese planes. At the end of September 1944, after some three months of scientific probing around New Guinea, Pathfinder departed for Espiritu Santo, with written commendations from Admirals Nimitz, Kinkaid, and Halsey. She reached Pearl Harbor 11 October and Alameda, California, 21 October. The proud veteran headed back toward the war zone 18 December 1944. By this time the tide of battle had swept northward to the Philippines. She reached Guam 4 February to prepare for landings at Casiguran Bay, Luzon 13 March 1945. This first on the eastern coast of Luzon greatly helped to liberate the Philippines. On 28 March two enemy aircraft attacked the ship but she escaped damage. On 1 May 1945, one month after the initial beachhead was established on Okinawa, Pathfinder churned into Hagushi Anchorage. On 6 May 1945 at \\"Suicide Slot\\", Sesoko, a Japanese kamikaze plane crash-dived into the veteran survey ship's after gun platform killing one man, starting fires and setting off ready ammunition. Emergency parties quickly brought the flames under control. Between her arrival at Okinawa and the final cessation of hostilities 15 August, the ship was at General Quarters 170 times. Pathfinder anchored at Yokosuka Naval Base, Tokyo Bay, 13 October 1945 and wound up her U.S. Naval career with a series of surveys among the Empire's home islands to assist the Allied occupation. Pathfinder departed Yokosuka, Japan, 5 December 1945. Touching at Pearl Harbor 16 December, the ship arrived Seattle, Washington, 24 December, she decommissioned 31 January 1946, and was transferred to the Commerce Department on 22 August. On 1 October 1946 Pathfinder was returned to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. She was struck from the Navy List 13 November 1946. Seattle, Washington, sometime between 1946 and 1950.

He was born on December 14 in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, now a part of Pittsburgh, the son of Delia Dennig Hubbard and DeWitt Clinton Clapp, an iron company executive. He graduated from the Western University of Pennsylvania, today's University of Pittsburgh, in 1877. He married Anne Love in 1882 and the couple had two children. Clapp took an engineering position at Park Brothers' Black Diamond Steel Works. There, along with Captain Alfred E. Hunt, he established the Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory's chemistry department. Hunt formed a company in 1888 to exploit the Charles Martin Hall patents for making aluminum by electrolysis. Clapp was treasurer and secretary of the fledgling company. He resigned as treasurer in 1892 and was replaced by Andrew W. Mellon. The company became later known as the Aluminium Company of America. While Hall is generally credited with the invention the aluminum process, Clapp raised the initial venture capital to make the process commercially viable. The Mellon interests supplied the company's working capital. As Clapp's wealth grew, he pursued his avocational interests in conchology and numismatics. He had begun collecting coins as a boy in the 1870s by sifting through the coins of a toll bridge across the Allegheny River. He later became a founder of the Western Pennsylvania Numismatic Society. His grandfather encouraged him to start collecting shells. Over the years he assembled more than 100,000 mollusk shells, which he later donated to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. In the 1930s he donated his coin collections to both the American Numismatic Society and the Carnegie. Beginning in 1907 until his death, Clapp was president of Pitt's Board of Trustees. He was a driving force in moving the school from its North Side location to the Oakland district. He also was a trustee of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now known as Carnegie Mellon University, and was a member of the American Chemical Society. He died at age 90 on March 31, 1949 at his home in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Clapp Hall, an academic building on the Pitt campus, is named in his honor.

A widely published journalist for over 60 years, he was editor of The Bulletin (1964‚Äì1967) and of Quadrant for 20 years, and published 16 books on political, biographical and cultural subjects.Oxford Companion to Australian Literature (1994) Hyde, Hooton, Andrews, OUP. http://www.answers.com/library/Australian+Literature-cid-17647929 \\"Peter Coleman\\" accessed 8 June 2012 While still working as an editor and journalist he had a short but distinguished political career as a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1968‚Äì1978 for the Liberal Party, serving both as a Minister in the State Cabinet and in the final year as Leader of the New South Wales Opposition. From 1981‚Äì1987 he was the member for Wentworth in the Australian House of Representatives. Early life Coleman was born in Melbourne, the son of Stanley Charles Coleman, an advertising agent, and Norma Victoria Tiernan. Moving to Sydney, he was educated at North Sydney Boys High School and at the University of Sydney under philosophers John Anderson and John Passmore. Fellow students included the philosophers David Armstrong and David Stove. Coleman then travelled to the United Kingdom to study political philosophy at the London School of Economics under Michael Oakeshott, completing a thesis on the French philosopher Georges Sorel.http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/politics- in-a-poetic-key/3327118 Transcript of interview with Alan Saunders and Dr Ian Tregenza accessed 6 June 2012 He graduated as Master of Science (Economics) in 1952. On 5 April 1952 he married the writer and librarian, Verna Scott. Together they had two daughters, Tanya, who became a lawyer and later wife of Deputy Liberal Leader Peter Costello, Ursula, a children's writer, and a son William, who is an economist. After teaching English for a year in the Sudan, Coleman returned to Australia to undertake a career as a journalist. In 1958 he became associate editor of The Observer, a fortnightly magazine founded in 1958 and published by Australian Consolidated Press. Other staff members included the editor Donald Horne and financial editor Michael Baume. In 1961 it was absorbed by the legendary but ailing political and literary magazine The Bulletin and Coleman subsequently became editor of The Bulletin between 1964 and 1967.\\"Left to Right\\" Christopher Pearson 31 July 2010 http://www.spectator.co.uk/australia/6173473/left-to-right/ In these years he published his first books Australian Civilization, a symposium which brought together writers and critics ranging from Manning Clark and Max Harris to James McAuley and Vincent Buckley; Obscenity Blasphemy Sedition, a study of the first 100 years of censorship in Australia; the anthology The Bulletin Book; and Cartoons of Australian History, with cartoonist Les Tanner. When Coleman resigned from The Bulletin in 1967 he became editor of Quadrant magazine, a position he held for twenty years. Political life In 1968 Coleman was elected the Liberal member for Fuller, a marginal seat taking in North Ryde, Gladesville and Hunter's Hill, in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, defeating the Labor Member Frank Downing. Originally serving on the backbench, Coleman gained experience through his appointment as a member of the Australian Council for the Arts from 1968 to 1973, a councillor of the National Institute of Dramatic Art from 1970 to 1985, and as Chairman of the Interim Council of the National Film and Television School from 1971 to 1973. In 1974, Coleman became the Chairman of the Select Committee into Appointment of Judges to the High Court, which examined different judicial appointment methods prior to the 1977 Federal Referendum. Coleman was then further promoted in June 1975 as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier Tom Lewis, in which capacity he served only five months until his promotion to Cabinet. He was made a Minister of the Crown in October 1975 as the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue. When Sir Eric Willis became Premier, Coleman was appointed to the revived office of Chief Secretary from January 1976. He served in Cabinet until the defeat of the Willis government in the May 1976 election, at which he retained his seat on a slightly increased margin of 52%. In opposition under Eric Willis, Coleman served as the Shadow Minister for Justice and Services. On 15 December 1977 four party MPs declared that they would oppose Willis in a leadership ballot the next day. On 16 December 1977, Willis resigned and Coleman was elected as the leader by the party. At the 1978 election, Coleman and the Coalition campaigned on a platform based around the spectre of \\"Whitlamism\\" and attempted to undermine the strong central leadership of Wran. This failed to resonate with voters, and the election, which was later termed the \\"Wranslide\\", saw a massive defeat for the Opposition Coalition. Coleman himself lost his seat of Fuller to Hunter's Hill Municipal Council Alderman, Rodney Cavalier, a result that had been anticipated by some.Troy Bramston, editor (2006) \\"The Wran Era\\" Federation Press, with a foreword by Neville Wran In September 1979, Coleman was appointed as Administrator of Norfolk Island. Following the resignation of Robert Ellicott, he gained Liberal Party pre-selection for the federal seat of Wentworth and was elected in a by-election in April 1981. He retired from parliament before the 1987 election and resumed his literary career. Post- politics On leaving politics, Coleman resumed his career as a full-time writer, publishing widely both journalism and books, including a major history of the intellectuals and the Cold War, The Liberal Conspiracy. The Congress for Cultural Freedom and the Struggle for the Mind of Postwar Europe and biographical works on the Australian poet James McAuley, comic artist Barry Humphries, film director Bruce Beresford and economist Heinz Arndt. He also published a selection of poetry, a cookbook and a collection of his Quadrant essays, The Last Intellectuals. In 2008 Coleman assisted his son-in-law, Peter Costello, in writing and editing his account of his career: The Costello Memoirs: The Age of Prosperity. During this period he also recorded interviews, held by the National Library of Australia as part of the oral history project, with leading Australian figures in journalism, arts, law, economics, philosophy and politics, including Hugh Atkinson, Garfield Barwick, Bruce Beresford, Jim Carlton, Madge Eddy, Charles Higham, Kenneth Jacobs, Eugene Kamenka, Michael Kirby, Kenneth Minogue, Barry Oakley, Desmond O'Grady, Clyde Packer, John Passmore, Peter Porter, Adrian Rawlins and Amy Witting.Retrieved 9 June 2012 He was a regular contributor to the Australian edition of The Spectator with a weekly column entitled 'Australian Notes'Retrieved 26 June 2012 and also contributed to The Australian and ABC programs. Coleman died on 31 March 2019. Honours In 2001 Coleman was awarded the Centenary Medal. In 2008 he was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Letters (honoris causa) at the University of Sydney for services to Australian intellectual life. On 8 June 2015 he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) \\"for distinguished service to the print media industry as a noted editor, journalist, biographer and author, to the Parliaments of Australia and New South Wales, and to the community\\".https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1151751&search;_type=simple&showInd;=true Bibliography  Books  * Republished (2015) Connor Court Publishing Ballarat * Republished (2000) by Duffy & Snellgrove, Sydney * Republished (1973) Republished (1978) enlarged edition  Republished (2006) Connor Court Publishing * Preface * Chapter One \\"A bit of Stick\\"   * ;Books edited * Introduction   *  Official reports    Essays, interviews, chapters, lectures  * 'An Interview with Peter Coleman' Frank Devine, Quadrant May 2006 * ‚ÄòA Political Formation or No Roads to Damascus' (Cheshire 1963) in Australian Politics.

Programs are typically cancelled for financial reasons; low viewership or listenership will lead to lower advertising or subscription revenue, prompting networks to replace it with another show with the potential to turn a larger profit. Likewise, a disproportionately high budget is potentially undesirable (this is somewhat complicated, as prominent programs have effects on the viewership of programs that air before and after; an expensive program may be worth the cost‚Äîa loss leader‚Äîif it increases the ratings of other shows on the network, while a profitable low-budget show may still be cancelled if it lowers the ratings of the surrounding programs). Other potential reasons for canceling television programs include unfavorable critical reviews, controversies involving the program's cast, conflicts among the show's staff members or to make room for new programming. Shows whose runs end due to a mutual creative decision by its creators, producers, cast, and the network it airs on (such as Seinfeld, The Sopranos, or The Cosby Show) are not considered to be \\"cancelled\\" but rather \\"concluded\\" or \\"ended\\", with a special last episode called its series finale. Even so, programs that end their runs in this manner are sometimes incorrectly stated to have been cancelled, even if the program was renewed for a final season (such as with American Idol, by which the term was incorrectly applied upon the announcement of Fox, Fremantle Media and 19 Entertainment's decision to renew the show for a 15th and final season in May 2015 to air in 2016); shows that are cancelled traditionally end their runs during the television season in which the program airs first-run episodes at the time, either effective immediately after the announcement is made by the network or until all remaining episodes are broadcast. The Friday night death slot is a perceived graveyard slot in American television, referring to the idea that a television program in the United States scheduled on Friday evenings is destined for imminent cancellation.  Overview  Commercial television and radio is supported by advertising. Subscription outlets, including cable and satellite television and satellite radio, have the additional revenue stream of subscriber fees (broadcast stations in some areas may also have retransmission consent privileges, but this is not universal; Canada, for instance, does not allow it). Viewing figures are collected by audience measurement ratings agencies (such as Nielsen in the United States), and the programs with the highest viewing figures command a higher advertising fee for the network. As such, shows with a low viewership are generally not as profitable. For most United States networks, the number of viewers within the 18‚Äì49 age range is more important than the total number of viewers. According to Advertising Age, during the 2007‚Äì08 season, Grey's Anatomy was able to charge $419,000 per television commercial, compared to only $248,000 for a commercial during CSI, despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average. Due to its strength in young demographics, Friends was able to charge almost three times as much for a commercial as Murder, She Wrote, even though the two television series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together. (A slight exception to this is CBS, whose self-stated target audience is persons 25 to 54 years old; because of this, CBS programs tend to favor slightly older audiences than their broadcast rivals.) Other factors are considered as well, such as the cost to produce the show. For example, most game shows cost less money to produce than a drama series, so even if the game show has lesser ratings it may survive cancellation because of the higher profit margin. Game shows and self-contained reality shows, which can be produced on short order with very little preparation compared to scripted series and annual contests, may not be canceled in the same way, but merely have the network cease ordering episodes and end up in limbo (except for those that have high production costs); in turn, these types of shows are also easily brought back if a network needs to produce filler programming quickly (as was the case with Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?, which was renewed more than three years after it had produced its last episode because of a programming shortage on Fox). Whether the show is produced by the network or an outside company can also factor into a show's future; networks, especially in the 21st century, tend to prefer shows that are produced in-house, as they can take advantage of vertical integration and, in addition to making money from the first run of the show on the network, continue to profit from syndicating the reruns. Thus, if two shows have similar ratings and expenses but one is produced by the network while the other is held by an outside company, the outsider program is more likely to be canceled. This was not an issue in the late 20th century, when Financial Interest and Syndication Rules prohibited American networks from owning syndicators. Very rarely are television programs cancelled for reasons other than ratings or profitability. Notable cases are Turn-On and Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos, which were canceled after viewer and station outrage; Bridget Loves Bernie, which was forced off the air in 1973 despite high ratings because of threats of violence from Jewish radicals; Home Run Derby, which was canceled in 1960 due to the host's death before being revived as an annual event in 1986; Roseanne, which was cancelled in 2018 despite extremely strong ratings over objections to title star Roseanne Barr's social media comments (this cancellation was eventually reversed as the show continued without Barr under the new name The Conners); Megan Wants a Millionaire, which was cancelled in August 2009 following the arrest warrant (and later, suicide) of one of the finalists; and Cops and Live PD, which were both cancelled in June 2020 as a result of protests following the killing of George Floyd. One example of a television program that was canceled because of war is the CBS Television Quiz, which was cancelled by CBS in May 1942 in order to allow the United States government to divert resources to World War II. Several television programs were also canceled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A television series that attempts to tell a long, overarching story can be cancelled even before it resolves all story arcs and broadcasts all of its planned episodes. For some series in danger of being cancelled, the creators may try to end the current season finale on a cliffhanger to give fans the impression that the series truly is unfinished and needs to keep telling more stories, but even that may not work and can produce a strong bout of disappointment if the series is cancelled anyway. Some series that are renewed and planned for another season can also be cancelled, like The Electric Company and Transformers: Animated. Saved from cancellation Occasionally, a show may be revived, or brought back into production after being previously cancelled. Such was the case with Unforgettable, a CBS crime drama that was canceled in 2012, but was revived in the summer of 2013. Sometimes, one network may decide to air a series previously cancelled by another network. For example, Family Matters and Step by Step both moved from ABC to CBS in its ninth and final season of production. This is an uncommon occurrence, and few programs have successfully made audience gains when changing networks. In other cases, overwhelming fan response may lead to a show's revival. The original series of Star Trek was given an additional season after a letter-writing campaign from fans. Another successful letter- writing campaign helped revive Cagney & Lacey. In 2007, Jericho was given an additional seven-episode order after fans mailed thousands of pounds of nuts to network executives (a reference to a pivotal line in the season finale). Strong home video sales and viewership on cable have also helped revive a series. Firefly and Police Squad! were revived in the form of theatrical films (an uncommon occurrence, since failed television series are usually not considered bankable movie material), Family Guy was returned to Fox, and Futurama (the volume 5 DVD cover touts the tag line \\"back by popular harassment!\\") returned in the form of straight to video films and a subsequent series of new television episodes for Comedy Central (although Comedy Central would later cancel the show itself). Arrested Development was revived for a fourth season in 2013 (seven years after being canceled by Fox) as a Netflix Original Series, after episodes of its initial run proved popular on the streaming service. In some situations, a television series may be revived years after being cancelled. Often this is in the form of a spin-off show featuring new characters (such as Star Trek: The Next Generation which premiered eighteen years after the original series went off the air). Doctor Who, which was cancelled by the BBC in 1989, was brought back in 2005 as a continuation of the original run of shows. Both franchises also produced spin- off films in the periods they were cancelled. This approach has seen increased exposure in the 2010s, with shows such as Girl Meets World (a follow-up to Boy Meets World), Fuller House (a follow-up to Full House), Will & Grace and Roseanne all returning to television approximately a full generation after the original series aired. In 2018, FOX announced that it was cancelling the police procedural sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine. However, after massive fan outcry, the show was rescued by the American TV channel NBC, 31 hours after it was cancelled. A show can instead be retooled if the network thinks that changes can be made to a struggling program that will make the show more profitable and/or higher-rated. In a retooling, characters may be replaced or recast, plots may be abandoned, and in extreme cases, continuity can be erased and the name of the show changed, depending on how extensive of a retool is undertaken. (In more extreme cases, a retooling can resemble a full reboot of the storyline.) One example of such a scenario was Lovers and Friends, which was placed on hiatus in May 1977 and was retitled as For Richer, For Poorer when it returned in December 1977; the program would end in September 1978.

Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933. It followed the Council House Fight, in which Republic of Texas officials attempted to capture and take prisoner 33 Comanche chiefs who had come to negotiate a peace treaty, killing them together with two dozen of their family and followers. The Comanche tribe was supposed to have brought white hostages as their part of the negotiations but only brought one young woman (the 16 years old Mathilda Lockart). Arguments and fighting then broke out among the Texians and Comanches. The Texas Officials were determined to force the Comanche to release all white captives among them. To avenge what the Comanche viewed as a bitter betrayal by the Texans, the Comanche war chief Buffalo Hump raised a huge war party of many of the bands of the Comanche, and raided deep into white-settled areas of Southeast Texas. Buffalo Hump gathers the tribes Penateka first war chief Buffalo Hump was determined to do more than merely complain about what the Comanches viewed as a bitter betrayal. Spreading word to the other bands of Comanches that he was raiding the white settlements in revenge, Buffalo Hump led the Great Raid of 1840.The Comanches: Lords of the Southern Plains. University of Oklahoma Press. 1952. Buffalo Hump, Penateka second war chief Yellow Wolf, Penateka third war chief Santa Anna and Isimanica gathered a Penateka huge raiding party, at least 400 warriors, with (maybe 500) wives and young boys along to provide comfort and do the work and, in the summer, raided the settlements between Bastrop and San Antonio. In mid-July they were ready and Comanches from every division (Nokoni, Kotsoteka, Yamparika and Kwahadi) were roaming trough Texas. Altogether as many as a thousand Comanche may have set out from West Texas on the Great Raid. On this raid the Comanches went all the way from the plains of west Texas to the cities of Victoria and Linnville on the Texas coast. In what may have been the largest organized raid by the Comanches to that point, they raided and burned these towns and plundered at will.R.E. Moore (2000). The Texas Comanches. Texas Indians.com Accessed 2007-11-04. Victoria The huge war party crossed into central Texas and first attacked the town of Victoria, August 6. Although rangers had found the tracks of a gigantic war party coming out of West Texas, and were shadowing the onrushing Comanches, part of the war party broke off and attacked Victoria before the citizens could be warned. One resident wrote, \\"We of Victoria were startled by the apparitions presented by the sudden appearance of six hundred mounted Comanches in the immediate outskirts of the village.\\"John J. Linn, Reminiscences of Fifty Years in Texas (1883). The citizens of Victoria hid in the buildings, and the Comanches, after killing a dozen or so townspeople and riding up and down, departed Victoria when rifle fire from the buildings began to make the riding dangerous. The war party intended to gather horses and loot the coastal towns, which were not as prepared for the Comanches as the central Texas cities. After the attack on Victoria, the Comanches camped the night of August 6 on nearby Spring Creek. The Sack of Linnville Leaving Victoria August 7, the Comanches continued on toward Linnville camping the night on Placido (now Placedo) Creek on the ranch of Pl√°cido Benavides, about twelve miles from Linnville.The old road from Victoria to Linnville, and the location of the Pl√°cido Benavides ranch (shown on the map as \\"Placido Venabides\\"), are shown on an 1858 map of Victoria County. Pressler, Charles W.. Victoria County, Map, November 21, 1858; digital image, (http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth89041/), University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History, crediting Texas General Land Office, Austin, Texas. Early August 8, 1840, the Comanches surrounded the small port of Linnville, Texas, which was the second largest port in the Republic of Texas at the time, and began pillaging the stores and houses. Linnville, which is now a ghost town, was located 3.5 miles northeast of present-day Port Lavaca. The Comanches reportedly killed three whites, including customs officer Hugh Oran Watts, who had delayed his escape to retrieve a gold watch at his home (reportedly a family heirloom). After killing Watts, the Comanche captured his wife of only three weeks, the former Juliet Constance, and a black woman and child. Realizing that the plains Indians would have no experience on water, the townspeople fled prudently from the Comanche raiders to the safety of the water. They were saved by remaining aboard small boats and a schooner captained by William G. Marshall, which was at anchor in the bay. While safe in the water, the refugees witnessed the destruction and looting of their town, unable to do a thing except curse them. For that entire day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping themselves grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds and bolts of cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded large numbers of cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.He was saved because of the Comanche reverence for the mad, a reverence shared by most Native American cultures.University of Texas Handbook At the time of the Great Raid, many trade goods were en route from overseas to New Orleans, Louisiana to San Antonio, Texas and Austin, Texas; a total inventory valued at over $300,000 was reported to be at Linnville at that moment, including an undisclosed amount of silver bullion. Linn noted that in addition to the cloth and other trade goods usually present in his warehouse at that time were several cases of hats and umbrellas belonging to James Robinson, a San Antonio merchant. \\"These the Indians made free with, and went dashing about the blazing village, amid their screeching squaws and \`little Injuns,' like demons in a drunken saturnalia, with Robinson's hats on their heads and Robinson's umbrellas bobbing about on every side like tipsy young balloons.\\" After loading loot onto pack mules, the raiders, finally began their retreat on the afternoon on August 8, 1840. The Battle of Plum Creek The Rangers had been trailing the war party for some time, unable to engage them because of their sheer numbers. But the three days of looting at Linnville gave the militia and Ranger companies a chance to gather. Volunteers from Gonzales, Texas, under Mathew Caldwell and from Bastrop under Ed Burleson, with all the ranger companies of east and central Texas, moved to intercept the Indians. They made contact at Plum Creek, near the city of Lockhart, Texas, on August 12, 1840. The Comanches, who normally fared about as a fast and deadly light cavalry, were detained considerably by the captive, slower pack mules. The normal Comanche tactic was to ride as fast as possible away from the scene of a victory, but on this occasion they slowed to a gentler pace acceptable to the heavily laden pack mules. Thus, the militia and rangers caught the raiders, which normally they found impossible. The battle of Plum Creek was really a running gun battle, where the Texans attempted to kill the raiders and recover loot, and the Indians simply attempted to get away. Although only a dozen bodies were recovered, the Texans reported killing 80 Comanches, and the war party losses were probably higher than normal. But greed saved the Comanches in turn; when the militia discovered the stolen bullion, they abandoned the fight, divided their loot, and went home. Conclusion The Great Raid of 1840 was the largest Indian raid on White cities in the history of what is now the United States‚Äîthough technically when it occurred it was in the Republic of Texas and not in the United States. The war party burned one city to the ground. Their total plunder included over 3,000 horses and mules as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars of other items ranging from silver to cloth and mirrors. The sheer volume of loot slowed them down and made them vulnerable to attack from a militia that otherwise would have never caught them. The militia concentrated on seizing and dividing the recovered bullion and other plunder rather than pursue the raiding party.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,905. The parish includes the hamlets of Cothill east-northeast of the village, and Gozzard's Ford northeast of the village. Frilford and Garford used to be townships of Marcham parish, but are now separate civil parishes. All these parishes were part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred them to Oxfordshire. Marcham parish extends about north‚Äìsouth and up to east‚Äìwest. It is bounded to the south by the River Ock and to the east largely by Sandford Brook, a tributary of the Ock. To the west it is bounded largely by field boundaries. To the north the parish tapers almost to a point, bounded to the west by the A338 road, to the north by the A420 road and to the east by field boundaries. The land is low-lying, rising from about above sea level by the Ock in the south to at Upwood Park in the north. Marcham village is on the A415 road, which runs east‚Äìwest through the parish. The A415 links Abingdon and A34 Marcham interchange to the east with Kingston Bagpuize on the A420 road to the west. Archaeology In Trendles Field behind the former Noah's Ark Inn, in the extreme south-west of the parish, the remains of an Iron Age and Roman village have been excavated. Evidence has been found of round huts and grain storage pits, to which a celtic religious shrine was later added. At the end of the first century AD a stone-built Romano-British temple was built on the site of one of the huts and a smaller stone building, possibly a shrine, was built on the site of the Iron Age shrine. The temple seems to have remained in use well into the 5th century. This site was subject to an excavation by Oxford University and a research project, with excavations being made each July until summer of 2011. In 2009 it was announced that the remains of a possible amphitheatre had been found. The amphitheatre is unusual in that it is round, unlike most Romano-British arenas which are oval. Manor The toponym \\"Marcham\\" is derived from the Old English Merceham, in which ham is a homestead and merece is a place where wild celery grows. The earliest record of the manor of Marcham is from AD 965, when King Edgar the Peaceful granted to Abingdon Abbey an estate of 50 hides that included Marcham. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that the abbey still held Marcham after the Norman Conquest of England. The abbey was forced to surrender all of its estates to the Crown in 1538 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Parish church The oldest parts of the Church of England Parish Church of All Saints are 13th- century, including the west tower and probably the font. The south doorway is Perpendicular Gothic from either the late 14th or early 15th century. Also Perpendicular are the timber roof of the nave and the 15th-century doorway to the west tower. The church was heavily rebuilt in 1837. It is a Grade II* listed building. The tower has a ring of six bells. James Wells of Aldbourne, Wiltshire cast the second, fourth, fifth and tenor bells in 1816. Charles and George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1855. The Whitechapel Bell Foundry also cast or recast the third bell in 1988. Economic and social history The Black Horse at Gozzard's Ford Hyde Farmhouse on the eastern side of the village is late 13th- or early 14th- century. It was remodelled and extended in the middle of the 16th century and again in the middle of the 17th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. Just southwest of the village is a circular dovecote. It is either late medieval or 16th-century. On the south side of the village is The Priory. It is mid-16th-century and a Grade II* listed building. Marcham has long had a watermill on the Ock, about south of the village. The present mill building is 17th-century, with an 18th-century extension. The road east‚Äìwest through Gozzard's Ford used to be a turnpike linking Abingdon in the east to Fyfield in the west. It was later disturnpiked, and in the 20th century the part between Gozzard's Ford and Shippon was closed and dismantled to make way for one of the runways at RAF Abingdon. An open field system of farming continued in the parish until 1836, when the inclosure award for Marcham was made. Air crash Armstrong Whitworth Whitley V aircraft, similar to N1439 which crashed at Upwood Park On 11 February 1942 an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley V bomber aircraft, N1439 of No. 10 Operational Training Unit RAF, took off from RAF Abingdon for night circuit training. A minute later it crashed in Upwood Park in the north of Marcham parish and burst into flames. The crash was ascribed to an error by the trainee pilot. Three of the four crew were killed. The survivor, Sgt DE Hughes, was hospitalised in the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford and survived the rest of the War. Amenities Marcham has a Church of England Primary School. The National Federation of Women's Institutes has Denman College, its residential adult education college, in Marcham. Marcham Football Club plays in North Berks Football League Division Two. President and Life Member of the Berks & Bucks Football Association and North Berks Football League, W.J. Gosling, was born in the village in 1928. Marcham has a village shop and post office called MVS. Marcham Cricket club plays in the Oxfordshire Cricket Association League.

A governorate can also join an existing region to create a new region. There is no limit to the number of governorates that can form a region, unlike the Transitional Administrative Law of the Iraqi Interim Government which limited it to three. A new region can be proposed by one third or more of the council members in each affected governorate plus 500 voters or by one tenth or more voters in each affected governorate. A referendum must then be held within three months, which requires a simple majority in favour to pass. In the event of competing proposals, the multiple proposals are put to a ballot and the proposal with the most supporters is put to the referendum. In the event of an affirmative referendum a Transitional Legislative Assembly is elected for one year, which has the task of writing a constitution for the Region, which is then put to a referendum requiring a simple majority to pass.

Early life Sarah was born in Rupert's Land, i.e. the Hudson Bay drainage basin, part of British North America deeply involved in the fur trade. She was one of eight children of Alexander Roderick McLeod, chief trader for the Hudson's Bay Company, and a mixed-blood mother (see Marriage '√† la fa√ßon du pays' and Anglo-M√©tis). She grew up at trading posts in the Mackenzie River and Columbia areas. She was sent to the Red River Colony (now part of Manitoba) to receive a formal education. At Red River she met John Ballenden, a newly appointed Scottish accountant at Upper Fort Garry, whom she married in 1836. This type of mixed marriage was still considered socially acceptable at this time. The Ballendens began to raise a family. When John was named chief factor, they returned to Red River in 1848. He was in poor health but recovering and they were active in leading the social life of the community. Foss-Pelly scandal In 1850, Sarah Ballenden found herself involved in a situation which became known as the Foss-Pelly scandal, characterised by Joseph James Hargrave in his 1871 history Red River as a cause c√©l√®bre (as quoted in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography). In short, she was accused of an adulterous affair with a Captain Christopher Vaughan Foss. Leading the defamation campaign was a couple named Pelly. It appears that the motivation was jealousy over the social status of Sarah given her M√©tis heritage. A three-day trial ruled in favour of Foss and awarded heavy damages but the apparent racial tensions were brought into the open. The situation was only resolved when Eden Colvile arrived in post, and dispatched the Pelly couple, Captain Foss, and the Ballendens away from the colony. John Ballenden took a posting at Fort Vancouver, his wife being too ill from childbirth to accompany him.

An Early Modern structure built from 1911-1912 by architects Kiehnel and Elliott, has been noted for its capital ornamentation over the entrance doors, and the wave-like shapes repeated across the cornice which likely derive from the German art nouveau movement jugendstil. The building originally served as the Central Turnverein, a German-American social and athletic association, and later known as the Central Athletic Association. It served as the site of various athletic contests, including some involving the University of Pittsburgh. During World War I, it was used to house those in the Student Army Training Corps. Following the war, a severe space shortage at the Dental School prompted the university to purchase the building in 1920 for use as a dental clinic and infirmary. Known then as the Infirmary Building, a annex was erected in 1922 creating enough space in the building to hold 200 dental chairs. The Gardner Steel Conference Center, as it is now known, is currently home to classrooms, computer labs, the Academic Resource Center, and the Innovation Institute. In 1995, the School of Engineering and the Department of Mathematics collaborated on a $250,000 joint project that created a laboratory for the computer instruction of calculus. The Gardner Steel Conference Center is the former home to the Pitt Club, a University of Pittsburgh faculty and staff club defunct since 2003. Previously, it also served for a time as home of the General Alumni Association (now the Pitt Alumni Association based in Alumni Hall). The Gardner Steel Conference Center is named after Gardner Steele, a Pitt alumnus and investor in the oil fields of Oklahoma. He matriculated in 1891 and was a member of one of the first intervarsity football teams and also held the record for the dash while at Pitt. When he died in 1928, he left the bulk of a $300,000 estate to the university.

A Windows-compatible version of QText was released, but the brand faded out from the public as Windows gained popularity and Microsoft Word with Hebrew support became available. QText is no longer developed. The DOS version of QText used encoding starting at the hexadecimal code 128d for the Aleph character. An early version of their web pages () has a working (tested July 2011) link to a 30-day free trial of the Windows version.

It has a biannual journal named: \\"The Journal of Jordan Academy of Arabic\\" (). Many dictionaries and occasional publications have been also produced by this Academy, as its interest covers Arabization of technical and professional terms, facilitating the use of Arabic in tertiary education as well as regulating the Arabic language and literature.

It was the second Arabic language regulator to be founded in the Arab world after the Arab Scientific Academy in Damascus which was founded in 1919. Due to the scarcity of financial, scientific and human resources, it was short-lived. A royal decree to re-establish the Jordan Academy of Arabic was issued in 1976.

It is located in the center of the group, eight kilometers east of Al-Sawda, the closest island, and the second largest of the group. The area is . The only village is located on the flat western part, with a population in the range of 100 to 150. It is reachable by boat or plane. An airstrip is located nearby. The island is generally rugged and barren, except for some tamarix trees and a little grass on its eastern side. The central part of the island rises to granite chimney peaks standing close together. The tallest peak reaches a height of . The east and west ends of the island terminate in comparatively low points. Ras al Hallaniyah, the summit and northern headland of the island, is a bold projecting bluff, high. The coast of a length of one mile on either side of this bluff consists of a Muschelkalk cliff descending almost vertically to the sea. The inhabitants visit the other islands with their boats, weather permitting, to catch birds and collect eggs. Other than that, their main occupation is fishing. The inhabitants speak a dialect of the Shehri (or Jibbali) language. During the Charif, from mid-May to mid-September, cold water rich of nutrients from great depths reaches the surface, bringing with it an abundance of fish. The sea is rough during that time, and the weather is windy and foggy. In early 2016, the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology released an interim report documenting the discovery and subsequent excavation of a shipwreck believed to be the Portuguese vessel Esmerelda. Esmeralda foundered in 1503 while being captained by Vicente Sodr√©, maternal uncle of Vasco da Gama, and was discovered in 1998. Although little remained of the vessel itself due to the shallow waters in which it sank, an excavation from 2013 to 2015 discovered 2,800 artifacts including an extremely rare √≠ndio silver coin minted for trade with India, a dozen gold coins, a copper alloy ship's bell, stone cannonballs, and part of what is believed to be an astrolabe. In March 2019, the astrolabe has been recorded as the oldest of its kind, according to the Guinness World Record.

The museum was founded in 2002 and became a non-profit organization in 2004. It features over 1,400 hammers and related tools, ranging from ancient times through the colonial days to the industrial era. Mission The mission of the Hammer Museum is to research, identify, exhibit, and preserve the history and use of hammers for the education of the general public. History The museum's founder, Dave Pahl, moved to Alaska from Cleveland, Ohio with the goal of becoming self-sufficient in 1973. He became a blacksmith and began informally collecting hand tools. His collection grew over the years through purchases, gifts, and \\"hammer hunting\\" expeditions. In 2001, Pahl and his wife Carol purchased a hundred- year-old building in Haines and intended to turn the space into a museum. If there was any doubt about the plan, Dave uncovered a ceremonial Tlingit warrior‚Äôs pick while digging a foundation for the building. The museum opened in 2002 and became a non-profit organization in 2004. Most of the hammers on display are on permanent loan from the Pahl collection, but the museum actively collects new acquisitions. For a complete history, see the website. Collections The Hammer Museum has several galleries featuring hammers used for blacksmithing, early trades, industry, and specific materials such as metal, stone, and wood. The collection has traditional hammers such as those used in mining, ranching, carpentry, the railroad industry, and auto-body repair.

His father, Frederick Gould, was a bootmakerChalk up the Memory - The autobiography of Sir Ronald Gould, published by George Philip Alexander Ltd (1976) who was later Labour MP of nearby Frome. His mother, Emma Gay, had been a servant to the Monckton family at Clevedon; her duties including looking after their children including the young Sir Walter Monckton. She was a descendant of the playwright John Gay. Fred and Emma were both musical: he was a baritone and she a soprano. At the age of three-and-a- half Ronald attended the local Methodist infants' school. At seven he transferred to a local middle school. After that he attended grammar school in Shepton Mallet, before going to Westminster College, London for teacher training. Career He completed his teacher training in 1924 and was offered a temporary teaching post at Milk Street Council School in Frome, and then took up a post at Radstock Council School, Radstock, Somerset. At the outbreak of the war in 1939, Somerset County Council appointed him as Educational Liaison Officer with responsibilities for evacuated children from London, Ilford and East Ham. He was also appointed as chairman of the local invasion committee. After becoming a teacher, he regularly attended meetings of the Radstock N.U.T. association. He was elected to the local committee and then to the Somerset County Association. He attended his first national NUT meeting in 1931. He made his first speech at the conference a few years later in Scarborough. He became head teacher of Welton Council School (now Welton Primary School in Midsomer Norton). In 1936 was elected to the NUT Executive. In 1942, Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labour, invited him to join a committee enquiring into the reasons for poor recruitment into coalmining. In April 1943 he was inducted as President of the NUT, a post he held for a year. By 1946 he was chairman of Radstock Urban District Council and also a magistrate. In 1947 he became General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers, a post he held until 1970.

The truncated normal distribution has wide applications in statistics and econometrics. For example, it is used to model the probabilities of the binary outcomes in the probit model and to model censored data in the Tobit model. Definitions Suppose X has a normal distribution with mean \\\\mu and variance \\\\sigma^2 and lies within the interval (a,b), \\\\text{with} \\\\; -\\\\infty \\\\leq a < b \\\\leq \\\\infty . Then X conditional on a < X < b has a truncated normal distribution. Its probability density function, f, for a \\\\leq x \\\\leq b , is given by : f(x;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma,a,b) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma}\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\phi(\\\\frac{x - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma})}{\\\\Phi(\\\\frac{b - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}) - \\\\Phi(\\\\frac{a - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}) } and by f=0 otherwise. Here, :\\\\phi(\\\\xi)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi}}\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\xi^2\\\\right) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution and \\\\Phi(\\\\cdot) is its cumulative distribution function :\\\\Phi(x)=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( 1+\\\\operatorname{erf}(x/\\\\sqrt{2}) \\\\right). By definition, if b=\\\\infty, then \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{b - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right) =1, and similarly, if a=-\\\\infty, then \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{a - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right) =0. The above formulae show that when -\\\\infty the scale parameter \\\\sigma^2 of the truncated normal distribution is allowed to assume negative values. The parameter \\\\sigma is in this case imaginary, but the function f is nevertheless real, positive, and normalizable. The scale parameter \\\\sigma^2 of the canonical normal distribution must be positive because the distribution would not be normalizable otherwise. The doubly truncated normal distribution, on the other hand, can in principle have a negative scale parameter (which is different from the variance, see summary formulae), because no such integrability problems arise on a bounded domain. In this case the distribution cannot be interpreted as a canonical normal conditional on a < X < b , of course, but can still be interpreted as a maximum-entropy distribution with first and second moments as constraints, and has an additional peculiar feature: it presents two local maxima instead of one, located at x=a and x=b. Properties The truncated normal is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a fixed mean and variance, with the random variate X constrained to be in the interval [a,b]. Moments If the random variable has been truncated only from below, some probability mass has been shifted to higher values, giving a first-order stochastically dominating distribution and hence increasing the mean to a value higher than the mean \\\\mu of the original normal distribution. Likewise, if the random variable has been truncated only from above, the truncated distribution has a mean less than \\\\mu. Regardless of whether the random variable is bounded above, below, or both, the truncation is a mean-preserving contraction combined with a mean-changing rigid shift, and hence the variance of the truncated distribution is less than the variance \\\\sigma^2 of the original normal distribution.  Two sided truncationJohnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Balakrishnan, N. (1994) Continuous Univariate Distributions, Volume 1, Wiley. (Section 10.1)  Let \\\\alpha=(a-\\\\mu)/\\\\sigma and \\\\beta=(b-\\\\mu)/\\\\sigma . Then: \\\\operatorname{E}(X \\\\mid a and \\\\operatorname{Var}(X \\\\mid a Care must be taken in the numerical evaluation of these formulas, which can result in catastrophic cancellation when the interval [a,b] does not include \\\\mu. There are better ways to rewrite them that avoid this issue.  One sided truncation (of lower tail)  In this case \\\\; \\\\phi(\\\\beta)=0, \\\\; \\\\Phi(\\\\beta)=1, then \\\\operatorname{E}(X \\\\mid X>a) = \\\\mu +\\\\sigma \\\\phi(\\\\alpha)/Z ,\\\\\\\\! and \\\\operatorname{Var}(X \\\\mid X>a) = \\\\sigma^2[1+ \\\\alpha \\\\phi(\\\\alpha)/Z- (\\\\phi(\\\\alpha)/Z)^2 ], where Z=1-\\\\Phi(\\\\alpha).  One sided truncation (of upper tail)  \\\\operatorname{E}(X \\\\mid X, \\\\operatorname{Var}(X \\\\mid X Barr and Sherrill (1999) give a simpler expression for the variance of one sided truncations. Their formula is in terms of the chi-square CDF, which is implemented in standard software libraries. Bebu and Mathew (2009) provide formulas for (generalized) confidence intervals around the truncated moments. ;A recursive formula As for the non-truncated case, there is a recursive formula for the truncated moments.Document by Eric Orjebin, \\"http://www.smp.uq.edu.au/people/YoniNazarathy/teaching_projects/studentWork/EricOrjebin_TruncatedNormalMoments.pdf\\" Multivariate Computing the moments of a multivariate truncated normal is harder.  Computational methods  Generating values from the truncated normal distribution A random variate x defined as x = \\\\Phi^{-1}( \\\\Phi(\\\\alpha) + U\\\\cdot(\\\\Phi(\\\\beta)-\\\\Phi(\\\\alpha)))\\\\sigma + \\\\mu with \\\\Phi the cumulative distribution function and \\\\Phi^{-1} its inverse, U a uniform random number on (0, 1), follows the distribution truncated to the range (a, b). This is simply the inverse transform method for simulating random variables. Although one of the simplest, this method can either fail when sampling in the tail of the normal distribution, or be much too slow. Thus, in practice, one has to find alternative methods of simulation. One such truncated normal generator (implemented in Matlab and in R (programming language) as trandn.R ) is based on an acceptance rejection idea due to Marsaglia. Despite the slightly suboptimal acceptance rate of Marsaglia (1964) in comparison with Robert (1995), Marsaglia's method is typically faster, because it does not require the costly numerical evaluation of the exponential function. For more on simulating a draw from the truncated normal distribution, see Robert (1995), Lynch (2007) Section 8.1.3 (pages 200‚Äì206), Devroye (1986). The MSM package in R has a function, rtnorm, that calculates draws from a truncated normal. The truncnorm package in R also has functions to draw from a truncated normal. Chopin (2011) proposed (arXiv) an algorithm inspired from the Ziggurat algorithm of Marsaglia and Tsang (1984, 2000), which is usually considered as the fastest Gaussian sampler, and is also very close to Ahrens‚Äôs algorithm (1995). Implementations can be found in C, C++, Matlab and Python. Sampling from the multivariate truncated normal distribution is considerably more difficult. Exact or perfect simulation is only feasible in the case of truncation of the normal distribution to a polytope region. In more general cases, Damien and Walker (2001) introduce a general methodology for sampling truncated densities within a Gibbs sampling framework. Their algorithm introduces one latent variable and, within a Gibbs sampling framework, it is more computationally efficient than the algorithm of Robert (1995).

It is possible that their function is to transfer chemical signals from the cerebrospinal fluid to the central nervous system. The term tanycyte comes from the Greek word tanus which means elongated. Structure Tanycytes share some features with radial glial cells and astrocytes. Their form and location have led some authors to regard them as radial glial cells that remain in the hypothalamus throughout life. This has led some to believe that these cells share the same lineage. Even so, tanycytes also display certain characteristics that distinguish them from radial glia cells. Tanycytes in rats begin to develop in the last two days of gestation and continue on until they reach their full differentiation in the first month of life. Radial glia cells on the other hand, are a key component of the embryonic brain. Tanycytes also contain many proteins not found in radial glia cells. Thus, evidence now suggests that tanycytes are genealogical descendants of radial glia cells that do not develop into astrocytes, but rather into their own subpopulation. Location Tanycytes in adult mammals are found in the ventricular system and the circumventricular organs. They are most numerous in the third ventricle of the brain, are also found in the fourth ventricle, and can also be seen in the spinal cord radiating from the ependyma of the central canal to the spinal cord surface. Tanycytes represent approximately 0.6% of the population of the lateral ventricular wall. Tanycytes have also been shown in vivo to serve as a diet-responsive neurogenic niche. Function Recent work suggests that tanycyte cells bridge the gap between the central nervous system (CNS) via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the hypophyseal portal blood. This may also link the CSF to neuroendocrine events. Role in the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone Researches in 2005 and 2010 found that tanycytes participate in the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH is released by neurons located in the rostral hypothalamus. These nerve fibers are concentrated in the region that exactly matches the distribution of Œ≤1 tanycytes. Œ≤1 and Œ≤2 tanycytes are found nearer the arcuate nucleus and the median eminence. Currently, it is thought that there are two different mechanisms by which tanycytes participate in the release of GnRH. One includes the cyclic remodeling of the spatial relationship between GnRH terminals, the tanycytes, and the perivascular space. The second is the cell to cell signaling mechanism mediated by specific tanycyte compounds. Recent evidence supports both mechanisms, and also the possibility that both are part of a single mechanism. History The term tanycyte was coined by Horstmann in 1954 when he described a distinct structural feature of the cell, which is a single, long basal process that projects to a distinct region of the hypothalamus. During the 1970s and 1980s, tanycytes were the subject of many research publications, ranging from their morphology to function. But the lack of advanced methodological tools stalled research and led to disagreements between researchers about the full role of tanycytes. Recent advances in immunocytochemistry have allowed for new research in this area.

Geography The municipality, with an area of one of largest in Germany, is located in the northeastern part of Brandenburg, close to the border with the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The rural community is part of the Uckermark historic region, it is surrounded by extended forests and the Uckermark Lakes Nature Park. In the south, it borders the towns of Templin and Lychen. History A settlement named Bozineburc was first mentioned in a 1215 deed. After the whole Uckermark region had passed to the Margraves of Brandenburg according to the 1250 Treaty of Landin, a Cistercian monastery at the site was founded; documented since 1271, about the time when nearby Chorin Abbey was established. In 1536 the abbey was secularised during the Protestant Reformation and devastated by Danish troops in the Thirty Years' War one hundred years later. Boitzenburg Castle was first mentioned in 1276, it was occupied by Margrave William I of Meissen in 1398 but returned to Brandenburg in 1415. From 1429 the estates were held by the Arnim noble family. Damaged in the Thirty Years' War, when it was a possession of Field Marshal Hans Georg von Arnim-Boitzenburg, the fortress was rebuilt by his descendants in a Baroque style from 1740 onwards. Refurbished according to plans designed by Friedrich August St√ºler between 1838 and 1842, it received its present Neo-Renaissance appearance in 1881‚Äì1884. The adjacent landscape garden was laid out by Peter Joseph Lenn√© around 1840. Boitzenburg was then held by Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg, who became the first Minister President of Prussia in 1848.

Tseng was born on 31 March 1926 in Sanshi Village, Taihoku Prefecture, now known as present-day New Taipei City, Taiwan. Tseng married Lee on 9 February 1949, when he was a teaching assistant in the Faculty of Agriculture and Economics at National Taiwan University. The couple had three children. Their eldest son, Lee Hsien-wen, (c. 1950 ‚Äì 21 March 1982) died of sinus cancer. Daughters Anna and Annie, were born c. 1952 and c. 1954, respectively. Politically, Tseng stated that she preferred to keep a low profile for her husband's sake. However, she became the subject of controversy in 2000 when New Party politicians Elmer Fung, Hsieh Chi-ta, and Tai Chi accused her of attempting to flee to New York City with a suitcase containing NT$85 million. In response, she filed a defamation suit against them on 29 March 2000, making her the only first lady in Taiwan's history to become involved in a lawsuit. The case involved the testimony of Wang Kuang-yu, which marked the first time that any Investigation Bureau director testified in a case under Investigation Bureau jurisdiction. The three were cleared of charges, but Tseng appealed the verdict to the Taiwan High Court. The appeal was submitted in April 2002, and the High Court began its own investigation in November. In December 2003, the High Court reversed the Taipei District Court's decision. All three accusers were fined NT$81,000. Hsieh refused to pay, and was sentenced to three months imprisonment.

Definition  Climate risk management is a generic term referring to an approach to climate- sensitive decision making. The approach seeks to promote sustainable development by reducing the vulnerability associated with climate risk. CRM involves strategies aimed at maximizing positive and minimizing negative outcomes for communities in fields such as agriculture, food security, water resources, and health.Hellmuth, M.E., Moorhead, A., Thomson, M.C., and Williams, J.

It is the administrative centre of the Comilla District, part of the Chittagong Division. Comilla is the second-largest city of eastern Bangladesh after Chittagong and is one of the three oldest cities in Bangladesh. History Ancient era Shalaban Bihar is evidence of the age of Comilla. The Comilla region was once under ancient Samatata and was joined with Tripura State. This district came under the reign of the kings of the Harikela in the ninth century AD. Lamai Mainamati was ruled by the Deva dynasty (eighth century AD), and (during the 10th and mid-11th century AD). In 1732, it became the centre of the Bengal-backed domain of Jagat Manikya. The Peasants‚Äô Movement against the king of Tripura in 1764, which originally formed under the leadership of Shamsher Gazi is a notable historical event in Comilla. It came under the rule of East India Company in 1765. This district was established as the Tripura district in 1790. It was renamed Comilla in 1960. Chandpur and Brahmanbaria subdivisions of this district were transformed into districts in 1984. British era World War II cemetery in Mainamati. Communal tension spread over Comilla when a Muslim was shot in the town during the partition of Bengal in 1905. On 21 November 1921, Kazi Nazrul Islam composed patriotic songs and tried to awaken the town people by protesting the Prince of Wales's visit to India. During this time, Avay Ashram, as a revolutionary institution, played a significant role. Poet Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi visited Comilla at that time. In 1931, approximately 4000 peasants in Mohini village in Chauddagram Upazila revolted against a land revenue tax. The British Gurkha soldiers fired indiscriminately on the crowd, killing four people. In a major peasant gathering, the police fired at Hasnabad of Laksam Upazila in 1932. Two people were killed and many were wounded. Comilla Victoria Government College in the city was named in memory of Queen Victoria . And the people of comilla were recognized as ITOR by British people that means they were intellectual, talented, obedient and reliable (ITOR). The main meaning of conversation is that the people of comilla have always maintained good relations and harmonized with others.https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2398721153683156&id;=1671913669697245 World War II Comilla Cantonment is an important military base and the oldest in East Bengal. It was widely used by the British Indian Army during World War II. It was the headquarter of the British 14th Army.

Born in Lausanne, Montan studied piano from the age of eight at Geneva Conservatory. Fascinated by the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, when he was seventeen he decided to study the harpsichord and its huge repertoire. In June 2000 the Conservatoire Sup√©rieur de Musique de Gen√®ve, where he was in the class of Christiane Jaccottet, awarded him first prize in harpsichord virtuosity. He was the last of Jaccottet‚Äôs pupils to be entirely trained by her. In October 2000 he obtained a degree in literature, specialising in musicology, from the University of Geneva. In June 2002 Patrick Montan obtained a post-graduate diploma in harpsichord studies with Bob van Asperen at the Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten. He also followed the master courses of Christopher Hogwood, Christiane Jaccottet, Bob van Asperen and Gustav Leonhardt. In 2003 the Leenaards Foundation awarded him a cultural scholarship. Concurrently with his studies and teaching the harpsichord and the clavichord, Patrick Montan has appeared in several European countries (France, Germany, Austria, Holland, Britain, Switzerland etc.) mostly as a soloist, but also as a continuo player of chamber music. He recorded on the original harpsichord by Ioannes Ruckers (Antwerp, 1624) in the Unterlinden Museum in Colmar works by Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Johann Jakob Froberger, Fran√ßois Couperin and Johann Sebastian Bach. On the musicology side, Patrick Montan has written a monograph entitled \\"L‚ÄôArt de toucher le clavecin de Fran√ßois Couperin.

Matas was the first to use spinal anesthesia as part of surgery in the United States, with work he conducted in 1889. He was the developer of the intravenous drip technique, of suction, of siphonage in abdominal operations, and the first to surgically repair aneurysms. Furthermore, he was the first to perform a Kondoleon operation for elephantiasis in the U.S. In 1896, he published an influential pamphlet, The Surgical Peculiarities of the American Negro. Many of his publications continue to be cited through the 2000s.

On first publication it was illustrated by Adrienne Adams, but later editions were illustrated by Barbara Cooney; the British Puffin edition is illustrated by Sheila Bewley. The story treats the simultaneous events of wishing for love, in Ivy, a young orphaned girl, and Holly, a Christmas doll. The story has been adapted into a stage production by the same name and a 1991 animated Christmas television program entitled The Wish That Changed Christmas. Synopsis St. Agnes orphanage has closed for Christmas, and all the children except Ivy have been dispatched to various homes for the holiday. Miss Shepherd, the head of the home, cannot take Ivy home with her, so she decides to send her to an infants' orphanage, a train ride away. Ivy suggests that she could instead go to her grandmother in Aylesbury, a surprising inspiration, since she has no grandmother. This inspiration is a primary theme of the story, which begins, \\"This is a story about wishing.\\" Ivy is put on a train. She tells travelers she will be visiting her grandmother in Aylesbury. When they respond knowingly to that, she says, \\"Then...there is an Aylesbury.\\" She gets off there and begins to explore, enjoying the Christmas Eve in the town and looking for her grandmother. A beautiful new Christmas doll named Holly is standing in the display window of Mr. Blossom's toy store, wishing for a little girl to come and take her home. The toy owl next to her, Abracadabra, treats her with undisguised contempt, and suggests that, since no one will want Holly after the holiday, she will wind up spending the year in the back room with him. Mrs. Jones, who lives a few blocks from the toy store, suggests to her husband, a police officer that they have a Christmas tree that year. Her husband refuses, saying that it would be a waste of money since they have no children to enjoy it. Despite his words, Mrs. Jones buys a Christmas tree and decorates it. After a busy afternoon of Christmas sales, Mr. Blossom's toy store finally closes. Neither Holly nor Abracadabra has been sold. Mr. Blossom is tired from a long day's work, so he asks Peter to lock up the store for him, telling him that he can pick a toy for himself as a bonus. Peter locks up the store, but the key slips out of a hole in his pocket without him noticing, landing in the snow outside the shop. Meanwhile, Ivy's search for her grandmother has not gone well. Feeling very discouraged, she is walking past the toy store when Holly catches her eye. The doll is exactly what she wanted, but she is outside, and the store is locked. She wishes to have the doll, and Holly wishes to have the girl (Ivy). She finds the key that Peter dropped, and decides to keep it. Night falls, and she takes shelter in a nearby alley. The next morning, she returns to the toy store to look at Holly, and overhears a conversation between Peter and Officer Jones, who has been on patrol all night. Peter is distraught about losing the key to the shop. Ivy realizes that was the key that she found, and returns it. Peter goes in to check the store. Officer Jones quickly realizes that Ivy is on her own, and decides to take her home for breakfast. When Ivy insists that she is going to see her grandmother, Officer Jones decides to let her lead the way to her supposed grandmother's home. Peter ensures that the store has not been robbed. Since Ivy saved his job, he decides to use his bonus to select a present for her, and chooses Holly. Abracadabra, furious that Holly's wish is about to come true, hurls himself at Peter and winds up in the trash. When Mr. Blossom goes to retrieve him later, he has mysteriously vanished. When Ivy sees a house with a beautiful Christmas tree and no children, she claims it is her grandmother's house, which surprises Officer Jones, because it is his own home. When he lets them inside, Mrs. Jones quickly accepts Ivy, and Ivy decides she has found her grandmother. Shortly after, Peter delivers a beautifully wrapped box, which contains Holly. Everyone's wishes have come true: Ivy has a family and a Christmas doll, Holly has a little girl, and Mrs. Jones has a child - she and Officer Jones adopt Ivy. The story ends with a reflection of \\"If\\" imaginings showing how thin are the threads holding together the big elements of the story, and \\"If I had not wished,\\" concludes Holly.

They are right next to Abracadabra on the shelf and are very afraid of him. * Crumple - An elephant in the toy shop. * Other dolls - A bride and two bridesmaids who are next to Holly on the shelf, none of whom are sold during Christmas. The three dolls mention that they can be sold at other times of the year (the yellow primrose bridesmaid is suitable for spring, the pink rose bridesmaid is appropriate for summer, and the orange blossom bride is appropriate for any time a wedding happens). Television adaptation A television adaptation of the book entitled The Wish That Changed Christmas aired on CBS as part of the Ronald McDonald Family Theater on December 20, 1991. The 30 minute show featured the voice of Jonathan Winters as The Owl, with Brittany Thornton and Lea Floden voicing the characters of Ivy and Holly. The New York Times and Los Angeles Times were both highly critical of the special's script, animation, and of the presence of Ronald McDonald as the show's host, which the Los Angeles Times felt made the show \\"feel suspiciously like a long, low-key commercial for a certain fast-food chain.\\" The Washington Post was more favorable in their review, but also voiced skepticism over the presence of Ronald McDonald as the special's host. Reception The Guardian gave a favorable review for the book, marking it as one of their \\"perennial favorites\\". The Horn Book Magazine also rated it highly, as they felt it was \\"Texturally rich and evocatively wintry\\" and recommended it as a read for the \\"whole family\\". The Boston Parents Paper has named the book one of their \\"100 Best Children's Books of All Time\\".

His unconventional teaching style was an inspiration for the character of Mr. Keating, played by Robin Williams in the film Dead Poets Society. Pickering specializes in the familiar essay, children's literature, nature writers, and 18th and 19th century English literature. Pickering has published many collections of non-fiction personal essays as well as over 200 articles. Life Samuel Pickering was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, where he attended Montgomery Bell Academy. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) from the University of the South and a second B.A. from St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He briefly returned to his alma mater, Montgomery Bell, to teach, a year before attending graduate school, receiving a Master of Arts degree (M.A.) at St Catharine's. He attained a second M.A. and a Doctor of Philosophy degree (Ph.D.) from Princeton University. In addition, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Oglethorpe University in 2002. Career One of Pickering's students at Montgomery Bell Academy, Tom Schulman, later wrote the script for the film Dead Poets Society, basing the pedagogy of Robin Williams' character very loosely on Pickering's eccentric style. Pickering has eschewed publicity raised by the film and has since regarded the unorthodoxy of his classroom behavior as more goalless than that depicted in Dead Poets Society, in which unorthodoxy is employed deliberately as a way to preach the values of non-conformity and carpe diem. Instead, Pickering has commented that \\"I did such things not so much to awaken students as to entertain myself.\\" Pickering has often considered his teaching style purely purposeless and impulsive, and he criticizes those who have subsequently asked him about his philosophy on education, responding that people, regarding such large social questions, have trouble with \\"the realization that mostly it's all meaningless. I don't know why people want answers.\\" Pickering's writing has been characterized as equally sporadic, meandering, and amusing, with a common teaching and writing guideline of \\"You have to lie to give the illusion of the truth.\\" His non- fiction work typically takes a humorous tone and revolves around the everyday absurdities and pretensions of civilization. Regarding his writing process, Pickering has said: Pickering was an assistant professor at Dartmouth College from 1970‚Äì1978, associate professor at the University of Connecticut from 1978-1984, and has been a professor at the University of Connecticut since 1984. A Fulbright recipient, Pickering has lectured in classrooms in Jordan and Syria, and has held research posts at the University of Western Australia as well as the University of Edinburgh.

Service history During World War II, LST-758 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater and participated in the assault and occupation of Iwo Jima in February, 1945, and the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunt≈ç in April through June, 1945. Following the war, she performed occupation duty in the Far East until mid-September 1945. LST-758 was decommissioned on 13 July 1946, and recommissioned on 3 November 1950 for service in the Korean War. She saw service in Korea until late November, 1953. I James E. Thompson went aboard the 758 in November, 1950, and was discharged from it on 1 February 1954. She was scheduled to leave Korea in July 1953. When the armistice was signed in June she was held over to return prisoners from Koje Do Island to Inchon. Pens were built on the tank deck that held 600 prisoners and she made three trips to Inchon. She sailed to Long Beach, California, in November. On 1 July 1955, the ship was redesignated USS Duval County (LST-758). Following the Korean War, she saw extensive service with the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets through 1969. Duval County was decommissioned on 28 October 1969. Laid up in the Reserve Fleet, the ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1976.

It assesses how people identify themselves psychologically. Sandra Bem's goal of the BSRI was to examine psychological androgyny and provide empirical evidence to show the advantage of a shared masculine and feminine personality versus a sex-typed categorization.American Psychologist (1977) \\"Sandra Lipsitz Bem: Early Career Award.\\" American Psychologist (32)88-89 The test is formatted with 60 different personality traits which participants rate themselves based on a 7-point Likert scale. Traits are evenly dispersed, 20 masculine, 20 feminine, and 20 filler traits thought to be gender neutral.Bem & Sandra Lipsitz (1981) \\"Bem Sex-Role Inventory\\" Mental Measurements Yearbook with Tests in Print, (9) All traits in the BSRI are positively valued personality aspects.Lee, Aldora (1982) \\"Psychological Androgyny and Social Desirability\\" Journal of Personality Assessment, (46)147 Numerous past studies have found that gender categorizations are correlated with many stereotypical gendered behaviors. History \\"In the field of psychology, much research is conducted involving individuals' perceptions of gender roles, and behavioral as well as attitudinal correlates. Gender roles may be defined as \\"expectations about what is appropriate behavior for each sex\\". One can also add to this definition the expectations which are held about appropriate personality characteristics.\\" The Bem Sex-Role Inventory was created by Sandra Bem in an effort to measure androgyny. It was published in 1974. Stereotypical masculine and feminine traits were found by surveying 100 Stanford undergraduate students on which traits they found to be socially desirable for each sex. The original list of 200 traits was narrowed down to the 40 masculine and feminine traits that appear on the present test.Gaa, John P. & Liberman, Dov. (1980) \\"Response Tendency on the Bem Sex-Role Inventory.\\" The Journal of Psychology. (2)259 Normative data was found from a 1973 sample for 444 males and 279 females and a 1978 sample of 340 females and 476 males all also from Stanford University undergraduates. Scoring and interpretation Participants are asked to rate themselves on each trait using a Likert scale. One indicates never or almost never true, while a seven would indicate always or almost always true. Originally androgyny was calculated by finding the t-ratio difference between masculine and feminine scores; however, in 1981 Bem advises users to utilize a split median technique for more accurate scoring. The Bem Sex-Role Inventory offers four different possible resulting categorizations: masculine, feminine, androgynous and undifferentiated. Previously, an androgynous score was thought to be the result of equal masculine and feminine traits, while a sex-typed masculine or feminine score is the result of more traits belonging in one or the other category. The fourth type of score, undifferentiated, was seen as the result of extremely low masculine and feminine traits. However, after the change in scoring technique, androgynous is the result of scoring above the median in both masculine and feminine categories. Sex-typed scores, masculine and feminine, are the result of scoring above the median in one gender and below the median in the other. An undifferentiated score is now a result of scoring below the median in both masculine and feminine categories. In other words, since scores are based on normative data, an androgynous classification occurs when a subject scores above 50% of the comparison group in both masculine and feminine categories, while a sex-typed classification is the result of scoring above half the comparison group in only one gender category.Sedney, Mars Anne (1981) \\"Comments on Median Split Procedures for Scoring Androgyny Measures.\\" Sex Roles (7)217 Reliability and validity The BSRI is very empirically sound. Bem reports coefficient alphas of .78 for femininity scales and .87 for the masculinity scale. BSRI, also has demonstrated high test-retest reliability. However, since this is a self-report inventory, how reliable the assessment is depends on how accurately participants rate themselves. An androgynous score is the result of extremely masculine and feminine scores and an undifferentiated score is the result of extremely low masculine and feminine scores. It has been theorized that perhaps tendencies to rate oneself extremely low and extremely high on traits can affect a subjects' resulting gender placement. The degree of reliability of each scoring technique is up for debate. When comparing the old t ratio scoring to the newly endorsed median split technique, 42.3% of participants had a different resulting categorization. Since the median split method bases scores more heavily on the normative data of that population, a participant can be categorized differently based on the population of subjects they take the test with. For example, results may differ if the test was administered to a group of marines versus students at a private girls highschool. This challenges the test's between sample reliability. As stated by Elazae Pedhazur in a clip from his critique, \\"Bem concludes her discussion by stating, 'Finally, we urge investigators to further analyze their data without categorizing individual subjects in any way, i.e., through the use of multiple regression technique.' While endorsing what appears to be a suggestion to conduct studies within the framework of trait-treatment interactions, one cannot help wondering: Where has androgyny gone?\\"Pedhazur, Elazae. \\"Bem Sex Role Inventory: A Theoretical and Methodological Critique.\\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (1979): 996-1016. EBSCOhost. Web. 13 Oct. 2013. . Bem Sex-Role Inventory (short form) The short form of the BSRI consists of 30 items. It has a strong .90 correlation with the original BSRI. This short form of the test allows for increased internal consistency. Bem reports similar masculinity coefficient alphas and higher femininity coefficient alphas with this form. The short form discards the traits \\"feminine\\", \\"masculine\\", and \\"athletic\\" from the self-report scales. Specifically, the short form removed some feminine traits that could be seen as less socially desirable such as \\"gullible\\" and \\"childlike\\". Masculine categories depict \\"assertive-dominance\\" and \\"instrumentality\\", while feminine categories depict \\"nurtureness- interpersonal warmth\\" and \\"expressiveness\\".

Retrieved 13 June 2007. Calls for intelligence-led policing originated in the 1990s, both in Britain and in the United States. In the U.S., Mark Riebling's 1994 book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA spotlighted the conflict between law enforcement and intelligence, and urged cops to become \\"more like spies.\\" Intelligence-led policing gained considerable momentum globally following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. It is now advocated by the leading police associations in North America and the UK.Edmund F. McGarrell, Joshua D. Freilich, and Steven Chermak, ‚ÄúIntelligence- led Policing as a Framework for Responding to Terrorism,‚Äù Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice, Vol. 23, no. 2 (May 2007): 142-158. Although intelligence-led policing builds on earlier paradigms, such as community policing, problem-oriented policing, and the partnership model of policing, it originated as a rejection of the \\"reactive\\" focus on crime of community policing, with calls for police to spend more time employing informants and surveillance to combat recidivist offenders.Audit Commission \\"Helping With Enquiries: Tackling Crime Effectively\\" (London: HMSO, 1993). Recently, intelligence-led policing has undergone a 'revisionist'Hale, C., Heaton, R. and Uglow, S. (2004) \\"Uniform styles? Aspects of police centralization in England and Wales\\", Policing and Society, Vol. 14, no. 3 (2004), 291-312. expansion to allow incorporation of reassurance and neighbourhood policing.Maguire, M. and John, T. \\"Intelligence led policing, managerialism and community engagement: Competing priorities and the role of the National Intelligence Model in the UK\\", Policing and Society, Vol. 16 no. 1 (2006): 67-85. History Prior to intelligence-led policing, a responsive strategy was the main method of policing. However, as crime was perceived to outgrow police resources in the UK, there was a demand gap, and a call for a new strategy that would more efficiently use the resources available at the time Early development of intelligence-led policing took place in the UK. It was perceived that police were spending too much time responding to specific incidents, and not tackling the problem of repeat offenders. Therefore, reports by the Audit Commission in 1993 and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in 1997 advocated increased use of intelligence, surveillance and informants to target recidivist offenders, so that police could be more effective in fighting crime. The call was quickly taken up by some police forces, particularly the Kent Constabulary. Intelligence led policing was not a major proponent of policing styles until the September 11th terrorist attacks. Prior to these attacks the majority of all branches of the government would often not divulge any information to each other. The main assumptions of this theory can be described by Ratcliffe‚Äôs 3i format. As shown by the figure below,the three I‚Äôs call for close cooperation between police chiefs and intelligence analysts in order to facilitate a strategy that will impact the criminal environment. Figure 1. 3i Model of Intelligence-led Policing adapted from Ratcliffe Police efforts in the homeland security mission will be changing as the main threats begin to change. \\"the principal threats are local, selfgenerating, and self-directed. If there are direct connections overseas, these are likely initiated by local actors. This isn't intended to minimize the international threat, but a caution that local threats will increase‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt has become plausible that a small group of non-state actors, such as terrorists, could launch a serious attack against the nation using weapons of mass destruction, or even small arms, as in Mumbai. These individuals might live in a local U.S. community or halfway across the world, yet plan and execute a massive and violent attack against a local U.S. community‚Äù. This change will effect the intelligence that is collected by police departments. Misconceptions Oftentimes the intelligence in intelligence led policing is seen as the gathering of information, however the process does not start or begin there. The National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP) which was introduced in 2003 contained 28 recommendations for major changes to policing and a process of collecting data. NCISP is a process of intelligence, also known as the intelligence cycle. Intelligence is seen as information that has been gathered and analyzed. This can be done through computer software but usually that only simplifies data, instead to be considered intelligence it must be analyzed by a trained analyst. Camden Study Camden, New Jersey was once considered one of the most violent cities in the world. This was attributed to the large amount of violent crimes that were reported in the city. The large amount of violent crime was attributed to the disputed \\"gang corners\\". On these gang corners, rival gangs would often dispute territory boundaries of where they could sell drugs. A study found that the majority of crime took place in areas that had multiple gangs.Ratcliffe, J.H. and Taniguchi, T. A. (in press) ‚ÄúIs crime higher around drug‚Äêgang street corners? Two spatial approaches to the relationship between gang set spaces and local crime levels‚Äù. Crime Patterns and Analysis, Vol 1, Issue 1. Through interviews with police officers, the study also found that their focus was more on gang activity, rather than the location of said activity. Therefore, in order to change the environment, the police department of Camden would use a \\"location denial strategy\\", where a police officer would be placed in these locations until they were no longer disputed. United Kingdom(UK) Intelligence-led policing in the UK has been applied as a specialized police practice involving the identification and targeting of high-rate, chronic offenders, and devising strategic interventions based on that intelligence. ILP originated as a problem-oriented strategy in Northern Ireland (Royal Ulster Constabulary) and was adopted by the Kent and Northumbria Constabularies in combating motor vehicle theft and other property crime. Kent prioritized its calls for service, placing less priority on minor service calls, and referring them to other agencies, in order to provide police with more time to focus on the property crimes. Rather than reactively responding to individual incidents, a systematic analysis of offenses was conducted, which showed that a small number of offenders were responsible for a disproportionately large number of motor vehicle thefts in the area, as well as identifying repeat victims and problem areas. Using this knowledge to formulate a response, the automobile theft rate dropped significantly. Since 2000, ILP has been enshrined in Britain as the philosophy underpinning the National Intelligence Model. United States Intelligence-led policing gained its momentum in the 1970s, when the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals announced that every law enforcement agency should immediately create system for gathering and analyzing data. However, agencies were not governed by policies and violated many civil liberties, resulting in many agencies shutting down their intelligence functions by court order or voluntarily. In 1976, standards and policies were introduced to address the abuses that had taken place. These stated that an individual had to meet certain criminal criteria in order to be entered into intelligence files. In the 1980s, Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Centers, a sharing system, were introduced throughout the nation to collect and store data on criminals. The post-9/11 environment in the US, the \\"era of Homeland Security\\" for American policing,Willard M. Oliver, ‚ÄúThe Fourth Era of Policing: Homeland Security,‚Äù International Review of Law Computers & Technology, Vol. 20, nos. 1&2 (March‚ÄìJuly 2006): 49-62. has increased demands for law enforcement to build global partnerships and to work more closely with local agencies to expand the capacity of the state to fight both crime and terrorism. Owing to the belief held by some that 9/11 and other terrorist attacks could have been prevented if not for intelligence failures, a key difference between intelligence-led policing and earlier strategies is that intelligence is no longer considered a specialized function for crime analysts or intelligence units. Investigations following bombings of the rail systems in Madrid and London and the arrest of suspected terrorists in Canada, Britain, and Florida suggested that intelligence culled from a variety of sources may be the key to identifying suspects and successfully intervening to prevent attacks. On March 16, 2005, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff outlined a risk-based approach to homeland security threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences when he said, > \\"Risk management must guide our decision-making as we examine how we can > best organize to prevent, respond, and recover from an attack . . . . Our > strategy is, in essence, to manage risk in terms of these three variables ‚Äì > threat, vulnerability, consequence. We seek to prioritize according to these > variables, to fashion a series of preventive and protective steps that > increase security at multiple levels.\\"DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, > Prepared Remarks at George Washington University Homeland Security Policy > Institute (Mar. 16, 2005) In 2006, Mark Riebling of the Center for Policing Terrorism published a doctrine on Intelligence-Led Policing. Riebling's model leverages both Israeli counter-terrorist tactics, and the NYPD's Broken Windows policing theories. Among the Broken Windows mechanisms, Riebling's doctrine blends problem solving, environmental design, community policing, and public-private partnerships. Analyzing the operations of the Israeli National Police in Tel Aviv, Riebling notes approvingly that \\"investigation of the incident, even a traffic accident, is secondary to the number one goal‚Äîwhich is gathering intelligence. \\"For instance, when they raided a bordello, where the patrons were primarily Arabs from different parts of the region, Israeli police were less concerned about the criminal activity, than with preparing intelligence reports on who these people were, and how they got into Israel.\\"Mark Riebling, The New Paradigm: Merging Law Enforcement and Intelligence Strategies, Center for Policing Terrorism, January 2006. In its current conceptualization, intelligence-led policing is envisioned as a tool for information sharing both within law enforcement agencies and between all participants in the community, private sector, intelligence community, and public government. The concept aids law enforcement agencies in identifying threats and developing responses to prevent those threats from reaching fruition in America‚Äôs communities. There is no universally accepted definition of ILP, although the components of most definitions are the same or at least similar. > The collection and analysis of information related to crime and conditions > that contribute to crime, resulting in an actionable intelligence product > intended to aid law enforcement in developing tactical responses to threats > and/or strategic planning related to emerging or changing threats.Carter, D. > L. & Carter, J. G. (2009). Intelligence Led Policing: Conceptual > Considerations for Public Policy. Criminal Justice Policy Review, 20(3), > 310-325. Researchers have argued that, while the British experience with ILP has provided an important foundation for U.S. initiatives, there are \\"important differences in legacy and functional responsibilities that limit the wholesale adoption of the British model in the United States. Among those limitations has been the array of post-9/11 federal standards for the American law enforcement intelligence process, including the new dimension of homeland security intelligence. One of the differences between the British model and the U.S. model is that of balancing American constitutional rights, and the act of gathering intelligence.\\" Although the implementation of ILP is expected to be difficult for most U.S. law enforcement agencies, Carter and Carter argue that the experiences and foundation of CompStat and community policing serve as important springboards for success. Although there are substantive differences in the concepts, the similarities serve as reliable policy experiences to make implementation of ILP a functional reality\\" (p. 322) Canada In the Canadian context, the lineage of intelligence-led policing can be traced to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police‚Äôs failure to prevent the 1985 bombing of Air India flight 182. Post-event analysis concluded that if the RCMP had had a better relationship with the Sikh community in Vancouver, they might have acquired actionable intelligence alerting them to the plot by extremists looking to establish an independent Sikh state in the Punjab region of India. This was an impetus for the adoption of community policing, but it was soon realized that the focus on ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù was a distraction in that hardened targets are not easily penetrated through better police-community relations; rather, it is the ‚Äúmode of information that is important.‚Äù Consequently, the RCMP developed its CAPRA model (Clients, Analysis, Partnerships, Response, Assessment), which fits with, and has been re-cast as, intelligence-led policing. New Zealand New Zealand has been experimenting with intelligence-led policing since the 1990s and has implemented it throughout the New Zealand Police, which is the national police organization in the country of New Zealand. Intelligence-led policing is encouraged throughout the districts of the New Zealand Police, and is implemented throughout the country and is an implementation of intelligence- led policing throughout an entire country.Darroch, S., & Mazerolle, L. (2013). Intelligence-Led Policing: A Comparative Analysis of Organizational Factors Influencing Innovation Uptake. Police Quarterly, 16(1), 3-37. One of the results of this experiment is that there was little sharing of information between districts in New Zealand. In the New Zealand study there were problems both organizational and behavioral that hindered the results of either using the information or gathering the information to make intelligence based decisions. The New Zealand Police are now implementing more aspects of problem-oriented policing to their intelligence-led policing system.Ratcliffe, Jerry. \\"The Effectiveness Of Police Intelligence Management: A New Zealand Case Study.\\" Police Practice & Research 6.5 (2005): 435-451. Academic Search Premier. Web. Crime prevention implications ILP is often viewed as a management tool instead of a crime reduction strategy. Jerry Ratcliffe claims ten benefits of the use of intelligence led policing: # Supportive and informed command structure # Intelligence-led policing is the heart of an organization‚Äêwide approach # Integrated crime and criminal analysis # Focus on prolific and serious offenders # Analytical and executive training available # Both strategic and tactical tasking meetings take place # Much routine investigation is screened out # Data are sufficiently complete, reliable and available to support quality products that influence decision‚Äêmaking # Management structures exist to action intelligence products # Appropriate use of prevention, disruption and enforcement He argues that these all help prevent crime by creating a police force that is more efficient with its resources. There is also a growing recognition within policing that external agencies may hold the key to long-term crime reduction. These agencies, such as local councils, housing authorities, and health and education departments, are believed to have a greater potential to impact a wider range of causal factors. As agencies share information amongst each other, a larger \\"network of intelligence\\" is created, which proponents hope, when used effectively, will cause a substantial decrease in crime.Ratcliffe, Jerry (2003) Trends & Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice Issues Intelligence-led policing is still in its early stages, and therefore lacks a universal conceptual framework that can be applied to disparate contexts as a policing paradigm. Implementation can also be difficult, because it requires police managers to ‚Äúhave faith in the intelligence process and in the judgments and recommendations of their intelligence staff.‚Äù Some have also questioned whether the foundational ingredient - intelligence - has been properly considered, given that police and security professionals already have to contend with ‚Äúinformation overload‚Äù from the huge databanks that have been built up in the intelligence process, and that increasing raw data is not the same as generating ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù or actionable intelligence.Jean-Paul Brodeur and Benoit Dupont, ‚ÄúKnowledge Workers or ‚ÄòKnowledge‚Äô Workers?,‚Äù Policing & Society, Vol. 16, no. 1 (March 2006): 7-26. As intelligence-led policing represents a move towards surveillance, it focuses on information collection and analyzing data. However, the way that this data is collected is a concern for privacy advocates. The United States Supreme Court has not made any particular decisions in relation to searches that deal specifically with intelligence-led policing. The cases that do cover most searches, such as Mapp v. Ohio (1961) and Terry v. Ohio (1968), were decided prior to the implementation of intelligence-led policing.Newton, Samuel P., Welch, Teresa L. Understanding Criminal Evidence: A Case Method Approach. 2013. Wolters Kluwer. Frederick MO. The question arises with intelligence-led policing of when a search has occurred. The U.S. Supreme Court has given a two part test to determine a search in Katz v. United States (1967). The first is an expectation of privacy, and the second is that the expectation of privacy should be reasonable. The issue exists in what type of privacy expectation an individual can hope to have with technology. Technology has given officers access to information that was unobtainable in the past. Finally, intelligence-led policing has been described as part of a larger trend of blurring the distinction between national security and domestic policing, risking the same perils that have tarnished policing in the past, such as political interference, violating civil liberties, and a greater potential for the abuse of police power with the increased secrecy that intelligence work entails.

Early life Grinnell was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts on February 18, 1799. He was the son of Cornelius Grinnell (1758‚Äì1850) and Sylvia (n√©e Howland) Grinnell (1765‚Äì1837). His siblings included Joseph Grinnell and Moses Hicks Grinnell. After graduating from the New Bedford Academy, Grinnell moved to New York City in 1818, where he became a clerk in the commission house of H.D. & E.B. Sewell. Career In 1825, Henry joined his older brother Joseph (who later served as member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Massachusetts) and Preserved Fish in Fish, Grinnell & Company. A few years later, with the addition of Henry's brother- in-law, Robert Bowne Minturn, the firm became Grinnell, Minturn & Company, whose operations were greatly expanded by its entry into the general shipping business. The company became one of the strongest and best known mercantile houses in New York City. Arctic exploration Henry Grinnell retired in 1850, around the time that he became very interested in the fate of the lost Franklin Polar Expedition. For the remainder of his life he corresponded regularly with Lady Jane Franklin and others interested in solving the mystery, as well as promoting and funding several expeditions. The first of these expeditions was in 1850, when he purchased and loaned to the United States Navy the brigs Rescue and Advance to search the Arctic under the overall command of Lieutenant Edwin De Haven. After these vessels returned unsuccessful, he funded a second expedition with the Advance under Elisha Kent Kane which explored the region named Grinnell Land off the north-western coast of Greenland between 1853 and 1855, when the vessel, hopelessly beset in the ice, was abandoned. In 1856, Grinnell was instrumental in having the recently salvaged HMS Resolute restored at the expense of the United States government, and returned to Great Britain as a good-will gesture. This was partly in the hope that the vessel would be used for a further search for the Franklin expedition. On later occasions, Grinnell manifested his unabated interest in polar exploration by contributing to the voyage of Isaac Israel Hayes in 1860, and the three expeditions of Charles Francis Hall between 1860 and 1870. He was also a regular correspondent with the writer and unsuccessful explorer William Parker Snow. Henry Grinnell was also one of the founders, and the first president, of the American Geographical and Statistical Society. Personal life Portrait of Grinnell's granddaughter, Frances Sherborne Ridley Watts, by John Singer Sargent, 1877 On June 12, 1822, Grinnell was married to Sarah Minturn (d. 1881) the daughter of William Minturn Jr. and Sarah (n√©e Bowne) Minturn from the prominent merchant and shipping family. Together, they were the parents of: * Cornelius Grinnell (1825‚Äì1869), who lived in London and died unmarried. * Sarah Minturn Grinnell (1827‚Äì1905), who married Ridley Watts (d. 1892) in 1851. * Robert Minturn Grinnell (1829‚Äì1898), who first married Isabella Musgrave. After her death, he married Sophie Van Alen (d. 1916), sister of Brig. Gen. James Henry Van Alen. * William Minturn Grinnell (1831‚Äì1870), who died unmarried in Arkansas. * Mary Minturn Grinnell (b. 1834), who died young. * Henry Howland Grinnell (b. 1836), who also died young. * Sylvia Howland Grinnell (b. 1838), who married William Fitzherbert Ruxton (born 1830) who became an admiral in the British Royal Navy. * Mary Minturn Grinnell (1841‚Äì1847), who died young. * Henry Walton Grinnell (1843‚Äì1920), who had a distinguished naval career. Grinnell died on June 30, 1874 and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. In 1880, the British Government presented his widow with a lady's desk made from timbers from the recently demolished HMS Resolute. This was not the Resolute desk, but a companion desk made from other timbers from the same vessel. Descendants Through his daughter Sarah, he was the grandfather of Frances Sherborne Ridley \\"Fanny\\" Watts (b. 1852). Fanny was a childhood friend of the artist John Singer Sargent, who painted her in 1877. The painting was the first that Sargent submitted to the Paris Salon. Through his son Robert, he was the grandfather of Josephine Lucy Grinnell (1877‚Äì1957), who married Fredrick Harold Van Rensselaer (1874‚Äì1903), a grandson of U.S. Representative Henry Bell Van Rensselaer, in 1898. After his death of cerebro meningitis, she married the actor Harold Rogers Woolf (1880‚Äì1953), nephew of Benjamin Edward Woolf, in 1905. They divorced and in 1913, she married Robert Stewart Smith (1875‚Äì1944). Through his daughter Sylvia, he was the grandfather of Sylvia Leith-Ross (1884‚Äì1980), who was an anthropologist and writer who worked in Nigeria.Helen Callaway, \\"Sylvia Hope Leith-Ross\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press 2004).

Origin of the name  The present-day Plaza de Santa Cruz was once the site of the Iglesia de Santa Cruz (Church of the Holy Cross), a parish church that gave its name to the neighborhood. The church in Mud√©jar style was constructed over the ruins of a synagogue, incorporating the floor of that older building. During the Napoleonic Wars the church was demolished as part of an urban renewal scheme, the old floor remained as the present plaza. The parish was moved to the monastery of the Cl√©rigos del Esp√≠ritu Santo (\\"clerics of the Holy Spirit\\"), now the current Iglesia de Santa Cruz in Calle Mateos Gago (Mateos Gago Street). The present church houses a painting of the Last Supper by 17th century painter (and Santa Cruz resident) Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo; Murillo was buried in the demolished parish church where the plaza now stands.  The labyrinth  Fountain in Juder√≠a Street. The Barrio de Santa Cruz is a labyrinth of narrow streets and alleys dating back to the old juder√≠a. These narrow streets provide protection from the oppressive sun of the Sevillian summer. Scattered through the neighborhood are several plazas or squares. Among these are the aforementioned Plaza de Santa Cruz, the Plaza de los Venerables, the Plaza de las Cruces, the Plaza de Do√±a Elvira, and the Plaza de los Refinadores. The Plaza de Santa Cruz, on the site of an old parish church and an older synagogue, has at its center an elaborate 17th century wrought iron cross, the Cruz de la Cerrajer√≠a (\\"Locksmith's Cross\\"). The Plaza de los Venerables is full of bars and terraces. Its name is believed to come from the onetime Hospital para Venerables Sacerdotes; it may have been the birthplace of Don Juan Tenorio. The tiny Plaza de las Cruces, has three columns, each topped by a cross. The elegant Plaza de Do√±a Elvira, with its azulejos (tiles), orange trees, fountains, and brick-and-tile benches, once a corral de comedias (a type of open-air theater), is the supposed birthplace of Don Juan Tenorio's impossible love, the mythical Do√±a In√©s de Ulloa, daughter of Don Gonzalo. The Plaza de los Refinadores has a graceful sculpture of Don Juan. Other plazas are the Plaza de Alfaro and the Plaza de la Alianza (formerly Plaza del Pozo Seco), along the city wall. Besides these public squares, one can glimpse (and smell) the flowering plants in the patios of private houses. The Callej√≥n del Agua, an alley parallel to the city walls, was once the route along which water was brought to the royal Alc√°zar of Seville, and was once the home of the American writer Washington Irving, as is recorded by a plaque made by Mariano Benlliure. The alley also leads to one of the exits from the neighborhood, via the Jardines de Murillo. Another exit from Santa Cruz is the Callej√≥n de la Juder√≠a and the enormous Patio de Banderas adjacent to the Alc√°zar and the city walls. The Calle de las Cruces has two wooden crosses on a painted red wall; the Calle de Santa Teresa is the site of the Casa de Murillo and of a 17th-century Carmelite convent founded by Saint Teresa of √Åvila; the Calle de Lope de Rueda is known for its mansions; the Calle Mateos Gago gives one of the best views of the Giralda. Other streets are less famous, but no less beautiful: the Calle de la Gloria, Calle Mezquita, Calle Vida, Calle Pimienta, Calle Justino de Neve, Calle Jamerdana and Calle Susona (formerly Calle de la Muerte).

He is best remembered for his early years with influential gospel group The Imperials. Smith spent four years with that group, recording four albums and one live video. Smith was inducted into the Gospel Music Association's Gospel Music Hall of Fame as a member of The Imperials. He has recorded several solo albums and is a songwriter. Early career Smith began his musical career in 1981 with The Imperials, following the departure of Russ Taff. Smith was familiar with the group through his booking them for concerts at Baylor University‚Äîwhere he was attending. Smith finished out the \\"Priority tour\\" and rapidly earned the respect of The Imperials' fans. For the 1982 album Stand by the Power, Smith co-wrote the title track and the hit \\"Lord of The Harvest.\\" He also co-wrote the 1980s, Larnelle Harris hit \\"How Excellent Is Thy Name.\\" In 1983, The Imperials released Side By Side. It was a double record set featuring five solo performances from each member. Smith had the last five songs on the album. Side By Side won the Dove Award for 1984 Pop/Contemporary Album of The Year. Smith recorded four albums and one live video with The Imperials before leaving the group in 1985. He continued to submit songs to The Imperials‚ÄîIncluding his song \\"Wings of Love,\\" which was recorded by the group in 1987. Solo In 1986, Smith signed with Dayspring Records a division of the Word Records. Live and Learn was a successful album in the Christian music marketplace. He only recorded three albums on this label. By 1990, the record label StarSong pulled away from Word Records and became part of Sparrow Records. Many artists including The Imperials had left Word and signed with StarSong, and Smith also made the move. Human Touch was released in 1991. It would be his only album released on that label. Smith continued to tour through the early 1990s‚Äîbut did not have a new album out until 1994‚Äîwhen he signed a contract with Integrity Music to release Extra Measure. The album charted, but the success did not last. He later served as Music Minister at the First Baptist Church of Colleyvile, Texas. In 2006, Smith's long awaited album Soli Deo was released independently. \\"Soli Deo is not a huge departure from the musical style that made Paul a highly recognizable voice in contemporary Christian music in the '80s.\\" In 2010, Smith reunited with former Imperials members Armond Morales and Dave Will, to record and tour.

Nowadays, La Macarena is the name of the neighborhood placed on both sides of the north city wall, but also a much bigger administrative district of Seville. Fray Diego street The famed Virgin of Hope of Macarena in close-up detail  Etymology of the toponym Macarena  The origin of the toponym Macarena is disputed. While some authorities think that it is derived from Arabic, others maintain that it is from Latin. If it is from Latin, Macarena would be derived from the male name Macarius. It is supposed that a patrician named Macarius would have been an important Roman landowner in this area. Alternatively, it is known that during Muslim rule, the still existing city-wall gate Puerta de la Macarena was named Bab-al- Makrin, which could be related with to the current denomination Macarena. The neighbourhood of La Macarena lends its name to the sculpture of Virgin of Hope of Macarena, sometimes known simply as La Macarena. Many Sevillian women are named after this statue. This gave rise to the name of Los del R√≠o's Spanish- language song \\"Macarena\\".  Monuments and landmarks  The neighborhood is known for housing the Basilica of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Esperanza Macarena (Our Lady of Hope of Macarena), seat of the homonymous Holy Week brotherhood. The procession in the early morning of Good Friday is one of the largest, most popular, and fervent in the whole of Spain. The wooden statue of Our Lady of Hope Macarena dates from the 17th century. The Neobaroque Basilica was built by Aurelio G√≥mez Mill√°n in the 20th century. Next to the church is placed the Museum and Treasure of La Macarena, where the huge artistic and sentimental patrimony of the brotherhood is exposed, working as a complete explanation about the famous Holy Week processions of Seville. The largest remaining portion of the Almohad city walls is to be found in La Macarena neighbourhood. It spans two of the old city gates, from the monumental Puerta de la Macarena (Macarena gate) in the west, next to the Basilica, to the Puerta de Cordoba (C√≥rdoba gate) in the east, and annex to San Hermenegildo church.Macarena gate The Parliament of Andalusia is housed in the old building of the Hospital de las Cinco Llagas (literally, Hospital of the Five Holy Wounds). Dated from 16th century, it is one of the best examples of Andalusian Mannerism. The Torre de los Perdigones (literally, Tower of the Pellets), placed in Los Perdigones gardens next to the Guadalquivir river, is the last remain of a foundry building from the late 19th century. Since 2007 it contains a panoramic room-sized camera obscura. In the nearby Feria street is located the oldest marketplace of Seville, the Mercado de la Feria. The building dates from 18th century and the greengrocer's, butcher's and fishmonger's stalls constitute a traditional and picturesque scene of Seville daily life.  Transport  One can get to and from La Macarena by bus. The TUSSAM C3/C4 lines are circular, running clockwise and counter clockwise all along the periphery of the historical center, and have many stops in the neighborhood. Lines C1/C2 are also circular, and connect La Macarena with outer neighbourhoods, such as Nervi√≥n, La Cartuja and Los Remedios.

Schools also incorporate nutrition-based curriculum and provide students with experiential learning opportunities such as farm visits, garden-based learning, and recycling programs. As a result of Farm to School, students have access to fresh, local foods, and farmers have access to new markets through school sales. Farmers are also able to participate in programs designed to educate kids about local food and agriculture. Currently, school lunches are generally designed according to the guidelines put out by the USDA National School Lunch Program (NSLP).http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/NSLPFactSheet.pdf More than half of US children participate daily, which translates to approximately 28 million lunches distributed per day. The nutritional guidelines for the NSLP lunches are based on \\"Dietary Recommendations for Americans\\" composed by the Institute of Medicine. Its requirements are that a school lunch includes one third of the RDA of calories, vitamins A and C, calcium and iron, and protein. Additionally, the lunch should contain no more than 30% of the total calories from fat, and no more than 10% from saturated fat. The guidelines provide unclear recommendations on fruit, vegetable, whole grain, and sodium content. In general, the guidelines leave room for interpretation and do not always lead to the creation of healthy meals. For example, in several schools pizza counts as a vegetable due to its tomato sauce. Another issue facing schools is the prevalence of other sources of food and snacks, which often make the problem of school lunch nutrition worse. One such source is called ‚Äúcommodity foods‚Äù which are free or low cost foods subsidized by the USDA. Of the subsidy money, 73% goes to buy meat and dairy, whereas less than 1% goes to subsidize fruits and vegetables. Schools also may receive ‚Äúbonus foods,‚Äù which are free surplus foods from farms or large-scale agriculture, which also are not typically healthy options for children.Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine, \\"Healthy School Lunches,\\" www.healthyschoollunches.org, accessed March 2012. Most concerning is the widespread use of ‚Äúcompetitive foods,‚Äù a term describing foods and snacks offered outside of the auspices of the NSLP. Competitive food includes such items as vending machines (which usually contain high-calorie sugary drinks and sodas, as well as other junk foods), snack bars, and pizza or bake sales. School lunch nutrition is of particular importance currently due to the emerging childhood obesity epidemic. Using the definition of obesity as having a BMI-for-age of greater than the 85th percentile, approximately 31.7% of American children qualify as being overweight, whereas 16.9% of US children aged 2 through 19 years meet criteria for being obese (with BMI-for-age greater than the 95th percentile).Ogden C et al. Prevalence of High Body Mass Index in US Children and Adolescents, 2007-2008. JAMA 2010 Jan 20;303(3):242-9. Epub 2010 Jan 13. Unfortunately, this epidemic is worsening with an alarming pace ‚Äî in school-age children, the rate of obesity has increased since 1980 from 6.5% to 19.6%.Ogden C and Carroll M. Prevalence of Obesity Among Children and Adolescents: United States, Trends 1963-1965 Through 2007-2008. CDC E-stat. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_child_07_08/obesity_child_07_08.htm Given this growing problem facing the nation‚Äôs youth, school lunch nutrition will play a vital role in halting and potentially reversing this concerning trend. Farm to School provides a model for positively influencing children‚Äôs eating habits through school cafeteria improvements, hands-on nutrition education, and community involvement and support. The last decade has witnessed a tremendous spike in nutrition- and health-related diseases in the country, especially those affecting children. In response, there have been numerous initiatives undertaken to combat the growing rates of childhood obesity targeted at changes at the school, community and individual levels. Farm to School is one such initiative, and it also has the added benefits of supporting small farmers, local agriculture, and local economies. History The National Farm to School Network sprouted in 1996-1997 from the desire to support community-based food systems, strengthen family farms, and improve student health by reducing childhood obesity. In 2004 the National Farm to School Program was officially authorized, and included 400 programs in 22 states.http://www.farmtoschool.org Additionally, the 2011 White House Task Force Report on Childhood Obesity recognized Farm to School as a strategy for obesity prevention.

In late 2011, it was decided that the National Farm to School Network had outgrown its original home and it became its own organization under the fiscal sponsorship of the Tides Center. The National Farm to School Network is as an information, advocacy and networking hub for communities working to bring local food sourcing, school gardens and food and agriculture education into schools and early care and education settings. NFSN includes all 50 states, Washington D.C., Native Communities, and the U.S. Territories; all are represented by Core and Supporting partners. The Network‚Äôs six main priority areas are:http://www.farmtoschool.org # Policy development # Training and technical assistance # Information development and dissemination # Networking # Media and marketing # Research and evaluation Benefits of Farm to School The Farm to School approach helps children understand where their food comes from and how their food choices impact their bodies, the environment and their communities at large. Potential benefits of the program for communities, schools, farmers and children include:http://www.farmtoschool.org * Nutrition education for students * Participation in school meal program * Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables * Improved nutrition * Reduced hunger * Obesity prevention * Local economic development: Each dollar invested in farm to school stimulates an additional $0.60-$2.16 of local economic activity http://www.farmtoschool.org/Resources/BenefitsFactSheet.pdf * Market opportunities for farmers * Food security for children * Decreased distance between producer and consumer * Influence policy-making at the local and regional levels Recent studies conducted by Beery et al. demonstrated additional, unexpected benefits from programs similar to Farm to School, as illustrated by the following quotes:Beery, M. & Joshi, A. (2007, August). A growing movement: A decade of farm to school in California. Center for Food & Justice,Urban and Environmental Policy Institute. Retrieved from http://scholar.oxy.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1381&context;=uep_faculty * ‚ÄúStudents eating from the farm fresh salad bar lunches took between 90% and 144% of recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables compared to the students eating hot lunches 40% and 60% of the recommended servings‚Äù * \\"Experiences from existing programs prove that innovative nutrition education, experiential education, and marketing programs for the salad bar are key to generating enthusiasm about the farm to school programs and maintaining strong participation in the cafeteria meal program\\" Environmental impact Multiple studies have looked at the environmental impact of conventional agriculture versus the local food movement.Conway, GR and Pretty JN.Unwelcome Harvest: Agriculture and Pollution. (1991) London, UK: Earthscan.Uphoff N (Ed.). Agroecological Innovations. (2002) London, UK: Earthscan.Coley D, Howard M, Winter M. Local food, food miles and carbon emissions: A comparison of farm shop and mass distribution approaches. (2009) 34: 150-155. These studies show that there is not yet a consistent methodology for measuring energy consumption in local versus non-local farms. ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù is not a clearly defined measurement, and by only examining the energy in terms of ‚Äúfood miles‚Äù versus an entire life cycle assessment (LCA), much of the research on local farming is missing key components of the farm-to-consumer process, and the energy consumption involved. For example, despite the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from transporting farm foods to consumers, agricultural soils are also responsible for releasing significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (Schlesinger). The life cycle assessment attempts to measure the impacts of each activity directly or indirectly involved in the production, transport, storage, retail, consumption and disposal of a particular food from ‚Äúfarm to fork‚Äù or ‚Äúfarm to waste‚Äù. Studies that examine the LCA still show that there is no clear conclusion on the environmental impact of local versus non-local agriculture. A study in Sweden that examined bread production using local flour versus flour from other regions in Sweden found that the smaller scale of local farms results in less energy efficiency5. Another study supports this argument that global food systems have better energy efficiency due to the size of production, the so-called ‚Äúecology-of-scale‚Äù.Schlich E and Fleissner U. The ecology of scale: assessment of regional energy turnovers and comparison with global food. (2005) Int‚Äôl Journal of Life Cycle Assessment. 10: 219-223. Both of these studies are countered by other studies that found lower emissions on small scale bread making facilities,Andersson K and Ohlsson T. Life cycle assessment of bread produced on different scaled. (1998). Gotegorg, Sweden: Chalmers Tekniska Hogskola.Jungbluth N and Demmeler M. Letter to the editor ‚Äì ‚Äòthe ecology of scale: assessment of regional energy turnover and comparison with global food; by Elmar Schlich and Ulla Fleissner. (2005).

These studies show the inherent variation in farming production, which leads to varying levels of impact on the environment. Other environmental assessments of farming production methods include: * Water consumption (including contamination of water from surface waterways exposed to feces from cattle and wildlife), * Use (and production) of fertilizers and pesticides (and the impact of these chemical in ground water), * Risk of food contamination and infectious agents from longer traveling times from farm to consumer, * Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the impact on animal and human health, * And mono-agriculture methods that cause soil erosion and soil nutrient depletion. Several organizations promoting sustainable agriculture methods have been created on a national and international scale in response to growing concerns about the impact of current farming production methods on the environment, the economy, human health, and animal health combined. Economic impact There is a widespread perception that serving healthier meals in schools and doing away with serving typical vending foods such as chips, sodas, and sweets will decrease the financial viability of the school lunch program (CDC). A growing body of evidence indicates that this concern may not be warranted.CDC. Implementing Strong Nutrition Standards for Schools: Financial Implications. www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/nutrition/pdf/financial_implications.pdf Accessed 5/7/2012. Though there may be an initial decrease in revenue, most schools have reported an increase or no change in revenue after implementing strong nutrition standards and restricting the sale of unhealthy a la carte foods in pilot studies (CDC). This seems to be due to an increase in school lunch program participation.CDC. Implementing Strong Nutrition Standards for Schools: Financial Implications. www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/nutrition/pdf/financial_implications.pdf Accessed 5/7/2012. Additionally, vending contracts are not a significant source of funding for most schools and can in most cases be eliminated without significant financial loss. A la carte foods from vending machines may simply compete with the school lunch program.Wilde, P., and M. Kennedy. ‚ÄúThe Economics of a Healthy School Meal.‚Äù Choices 24, no. 3 (2009). Stronger restrictions or even eliminating these competing options are most likely to increase participation in the school lunch programs which generally include the healthiest food options.Wilde, P., and M. Kennedy. ‚ÄúThe Economics of a Healthy School Meal.‚Äù Choices 24, no. 3 (2009). Advocates of farm to school argue that it will have a beneficial effect on the regional economy but there are few comprehensive analyses that have evaluated this. At least one analysis evaluated the potential economic impact of farm to school programs for an entire region (Central Minnesota) in a comprehensive manner.Tuck, B., M. Haynes, R. King, and R. Pesch. ‚ÄúAn Extension Community Economics Program. The Economic Impact of Farm-to-School Lunch Programs: A Central Minnesota Example‚Äù University of Minnesota Extension Center for Community Vitality. Regents of the University of Minnesota, March 2010. The investigators empirically developed a realistic set of potential foods to include in farm-to-school lunch programs in the region. Their analysis took into account the impact on output as well as employment and labor income in the regions. Depending on the price paid for the farm foods and how often the farm foods are utilized in school lunches, the regional economic impact ranged from $20,000 to almost $500,000 in their analysis. Though initial pilot studies and economic analyses provide hope that farm-to-school programs are financially viable options for schools and can also be beneficial to local economies, this research is in early stages and no longer term controlled studies have been completed.Wharton, Christopher M, Michael Long, and Marlene B Schwartz. ‚ÄúChanging Nutrition Standards in Schools: The Emerging Impact on School Revenue.‚Äù Journal of School Health 78, no. 5 (May 1, 2008): 245‚Äì251.

It lies to the east of the city centre (the Casco Antiguo), to the north of the Distrito Sur, to the south of San Pablo-Santa Justa and to the west of Cerro-Amate. The district is an important commercial district of the city, where much of the regional capital's business takes place. The population is 16,129 inhabitants.  History  Remains of the Roman aqueduct Prior to 1911, most of Nervi√≥n was cultivated land with multiple cotton plantations. The land was owned by the Marques of Nervi√≥n, who donated it to the city. A few structures did exist in the zone, however, including a penitentiary, Sevilla 1, which still stands, albeit out of use and in the process of historical renovation. At the time, the Roman Aqueduct known as The Pipes of Carmona was still supplying fresh water to the city as it had for nearly two thousand years. The aqueduct was demolished to make space for development, beginning in 1912.\\"Los Ca√±os de Carmona\\", jaimepf.blogspot.com (Spanish) Three small sections of the aqueduct still stand along Calle Luis Montoto and Calle Cig√ºe√±a in Sevilla. Development of Nervi√≥n began in 1911, comprising what was then an outskirt of the city with plans centering on the Gran Plaza. The architect in charge of the planning and development was renowned Spanish architect Anibal Gonzalez, who designed many other famous structures in Seville and the rest of Andalusia. In the 1920s and 1930s, many low-level villa-style houses surrounded by gardens were built in the area. Large high-rise apartment buildings were built in the 1960s. Since the 1980s and 1990s, construction has been mainly of hotels, shopping centres and office buildings.:es:Barrio de Nervi√≥n (Sevilla) It is presently a highly developed, modern suburb of Seville. Sites It is the second focal point of the city, and is home to a number of important sites:View of Estadio Ram√≥n S√°nchez Pizju√°n *Santa Justa, Seville's major train station, with high-speed links via the AVE to Madrid, C√≥rdoba, and Cadiz. *Estadio Ram√≥n S√°nchez Pizju√°n, home to Sevilla FC, one of Seville's two association football clubs in La Liga. The area's name is the origin of one of Sevilla's nicknames, Los Nervionenses. *Nervi√≥n Plaza, a commercial shopping complex with many chain stores and a large cinema with 20 screens. *El Prado, a gardened zone that serves as a major short-distance bus hub. *Estaci√≥n de C√°diz, the lesser of the city's two trains stations. It currently serves as a fresh produce market. The Facultad de Ciencias Econ√≥micas y Empresariales (School of Business) of the University of Seville is located in this neighborhood. The Seville Metro has four stations in the district: Prado, San Bernardo, Nervi√≥n and Gran Plaza. All of these are on Line 1, which became operational on 2 April 2009.http://www.metrodesevilla.org/index.php?id=7 The Prado station also connects to the planned Line 3, as well as the city's primary short-distance bus hub. Many TUSSAM bus routes connect Nervi√≥n with other districts, as well as internally. These include circular lines such as the C1/C2 in addition to a number of other lines, such as the 27, that connect it with the historical centre, the Casco Antiguo.

Like other neighborhoods that were historically separated from the main city, it was known as an arrabal. Triana is located on a peninsula between two branches of the Guadalquivir, narrowly linked to the mainland in the north. Two other districts are also usually included in this area, Los Remedios to the south and La Cartuja to the north. Residents of Triana have traditionally been called trianeros; they identify strongly with the neighborhood and consider it different in character from the rest of Seville. Triana has a traditional pottery and tile industry, a vibrant flamenco culture, and its own festivals; it has played an important role in the development of Sevillan culture and tradition.  Etymology  Legend holds that Triana was founded as a Roman colony by the emperor Trajan, who was born in the nearby city of Italica; the name \\"Triana\\" supposedly derived from the original denomination of Trajana. Another theory claims that the name may be derived from the combination of the Latin tri, meaning \\"three\\", and the Celtiberian ana, meaning \\"river\\", since the Guadalquivir river split into three branches nearby. An additional hypothesis suggests that the derivation of \\"Triana\\" is from the Latin expression Trans amnem, meaning \\"those beyond the river\\".  History  The first settlements in the Triana area are dated from the Roman period. During Muslim rule the neighborhood developed around a castle built in the 10th century. Triana was the last defence of Seville from the west before the city- walls. It was strategically important because of its position between Seville proper and both the coast and the Aljarafe region of grainfields, vineyards, and olive orchards. The construction of a pontoon bridge (puente de barcas, literally, boat-bridge) joining Triana and Seville in 1171 during the reign of Caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf greatly facilitated the development of the neighborhood. Because of Triana's strategic role in the defence of city, Ferdinand III of Castile destroyed the citadel (Castillo de Triana) and the bridge before taking Seville in 1248. During Castile's rule, the castle of Triana became the first Christian church of the neighbourhood when it was made the seat of a fraternal society, the Order of Saint George, which changed its name to Castillo de San Jorge (Castle of Saint George). Later, in 1481, under the rule of the Catholic Monarchs, it was made the seat of the Spanish Inquisition until 1785. The current bridge, the Puente de Isabel II, a representative symbol of Triana, was built in 1854. Since Triana is close to the Guadalquivir River, the neighbourhood was frequently devastated by flooding, as it had no levees to hold back the rising waters. During these periodic floods, the inhabitants had to take refuge at the Castillo de San Jorge and the Church of Santa Ana. The historically worst floods occurred in 1435, 1440, 1545, and 1554. The reconstruction of the Guadalquivir channel system during the second half of the 20th century finally eliminated this hazard. Triana was traditionally populated by sailors and potters, construction workers and artisans, with many bull-fighters and Flamenco singers and dancers living in the neighbourhood as well. Triana was also home to a large population of Romani people, concentrated in the street called the Cava de los Gitanos (now the Pag√©s del Corro), but they were displaced during the redevelopment projects of the 1970s.  Main streets, museums and landmarks  The Moorish Revival Chapel of El Carmen next to the Triana bridge Triana is connected to Seville by the Isabel II bridge (popularly known as Puente de Triana) constructed between 1845 and 1852 by Gustavo Steinacher and Ferdinand Bennetot. It has on its west side a small Neo-Mud√©jar chapel built by An√≠bal Gonz√°lez in 1927; both together constitute the most recognised symbol of the neighborhood. They were declared a national monument in 1976 after a proposal to demolish them was defeated. The Triana market, built in 2005 in the Moorish Revival style, is located on the southern side of the bridge. The foundations of the Castillo de San Jorge may be seen in the basement of this building, which is now home to educational exhibits relating to the history of the Inquisition. The traditional gateway to Triana from the bridge is the Altozano square, with its monuments to the renowned bullfighter Juan Belmonte and the flamenco arts, executed in modern style. It continues into San Jacinto street, a pedestrian commercial street that crosses the historical quarter from east to west, named after the monumental San Jacinto church, built in 1676 by Mat√≠as de Figueroa for the Dominican order. Betis street from the Guadalquivir river San Jorge and Castilla streets are the main axes on the north side of the neighbourhood. Landmarks in this area include the Callej√≥n de la Inquisici√≥n (Inquisition alley), a narrow street leading to the river; the Moorish Revival building of the old F√°brica de Cer√°mica Santa Ana (Santa Ana pottery factory), part of which has now been converted into the Centro Ceramica Santa Ana, the museum of pottery; the Baroque Parroquia de Nuestra Se√±ora de La O (Parish Church of Our Lady of the O), built between 1697 and 1702, and the El Cachorro Basilica, seat of the Holy Week brotherhood with the same name. To the south of Altozano square, Calle Pureza is the main street crossing the historical quarter. Here is found the Church of Santa Ana (Iglesia de Santa Ana), considered the Cathedral of Triana by popular sentiment. It was the first Catholic church built in Seville after Muslim rule ended in the city in 1248; its architecture combines early Gothic and Mud√©jar styles. Constructed by order of Alfonso X, it contains an impressive altar piece painted by Pedro de Campa√±a. Other notable buildings in this street are the Capilla de los Marineros (Sailors' Chapel), seat of the popular brotherhood known as La Esperanza de Triana (Our Lady of Hope of Triana), and the Casa de las Columnas (House of Columns), formerly occupied by the Universidad de Mareantes, an institution founded for the training of seamen bound for the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries. Calle Betis, the street which runs along the waterfront, offers a panoramic view of Seville proper, and has many of the city's most popular restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Triana traditionally contained a large population of Romani people, who usually lived in corrales, or communal homes. A corral is a building organized around a patio with a central fountain, the occupants living in individual rooms that open to the communal patio. The stereotypical image of Triana as a haven for gypsies is no longer accurate, as most of the corrales have disappeared during the latter 20th century due to pressure by development interests. Those that currently persist are scattered through the neighborhood and strictly protected as a cultural and ethnographic heritage. Among them are those located in Alfarer√≠a street, numbers 85 and 8-10 (dating from the 19th century and 1913-1914 respectively), in Castilla street at numbers 7 (1907‚Äì1910) and 88A (1918), and the house named Corral Herrera in Pag√©s del Corro Street (from 1909). Museums Tower at the Pavilion of Navigation A museum devoted to the Spanish Inquisition (Centro Tem√°tico del Castillo de San Jorge) is located in the remains of the Castillo San Jorge that served as headquarters of the ‚ÄúTribuno del Santo Oficio o de la Santa Inquisicion‚Äù from 1481 to 1785. Other museums in the area include the Centro Cer√°mica Santa Ana (opened 2014), which includes a section on Triana and its people and traditions, The Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor√°neo (CAAC) in the former Monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas also known as the Monastery of the Cartuja and Pabellon de la Navegaci√≥n (Pavilion of Navigation)  Festivals  Betis street during the Vel√° Santana fairThe Triana bridge during the Vel√° Santana fair The Holy Week religious processions in Triana have a distinct character compared to those in downtown Seville. Two of the most popular are La Esperanza de Triana (Our Lady of Hope of Triana) and El Cachorro (literally, \\"The Puppy\\"). The latter reflects the popular name of a sculpture of the dying Christ. Tradition says the sculptor Francisco Antonio Ruiz Gij√≥n, looking for a source of inspiration, saw the gypsy nicknamed Cachorro as he was dying after being stabbed. Ruiz Gij√≥n made the sculpture so similar to him that people realized the similarity and started to call the Christ by the gypsy's nickname, El Cachorro. Between 21 and 26 July, the Vel√° Santana (literally, \\"Saint Anne's evenings\\", because Saint Anne's day on the liturgical calendar is the 26 July) is celebrated on Betis Street. It is the city's second most important festival after the Feria de abril de Sevilla, although it is much older, dating from the 13th century. Here people drink sherry wine and dance the sevillanas, a type of folk dance; eating roasted sardines is also a popular activity. The cuca√±a is a popular competition during this celebration: people try to take a prize from the top of a greasy pole over the river.  Triana Flea Market  Near Isabel II Bridge is Triana Market, a busy flea market with food stalls and small restaurants that offer tapas, as well as handmade local crafts. The market stalls are open from Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 3 pm.

Characteristics  Clintonism refers to the centrist (domestically speaking) political faction of the United States Democratic Party centered on former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, both in their times in office and subsequently. This faction is also thought to include journalist Sidney Blumenthal, Democratic National Committee Chairman Steven Grossman, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros, Treasury Department Secretary Robert Rubin and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. While the primary qualification is being aligned with or part of the web of political and donor connections associated with the Clintons, the ideology of the faction can be said in broad outline to favor certain policies: * Free trade: Bill Clinton supported and worked to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement and create the World Trade Organization. Free trade was an essential component of his economic policy. * Balanced budget: Clintonism is associated with restraining the growth of federal spending in order to allow lower interest rates and freer monetary policy. * Greater willingness to use and fund the military *A willingness to compromise on social issues such as abortion and LGBT rights. * Reform or reduction of some government programs, exemplified by the ending of Aid to Families with Dependent Children as part of welfare reform. * Internationalism, particularly the expansion of North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The ideology is sometimes thought of as part of the Third Way, a brand of politics that is said to include (at the time or since) Prime Minister Tony Blair's New Labour in the United Kingdom, the Liberal Party in Canada and the Social Democratic Party in Germany under Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der.

The church was built during the pastorate of Ignat Opri»ô and Filip Zob Opri»ô, the later ordained in 1733 in Ia»ôi by the metropolitan Antoniu of Moldavia. The present church, as its forerunner, was named a BƒÉndrenilor, after the noble founder family »òerba, nicknamed BƒÉndreni. We do not know with whose permission the itinerant church carpenters had started the construction of an unfamiliar Moldavian church with lateral apses here, yet, the local tradition remembers the villagers became very upset for this and discharged the carpenters from their started work. Not until they succeeded to build another church, in Glod more like a local one, they were entrusted to continue their work in CƒÉline»ôti Susani. After their return, they seem also to have changed the plans, probably in agreement with the founders, and completed the church with the characteristic narrowed superstructure and a tower, like any other traditional church with two eaves. The church from CƒÉline»ôti Susani is one of the most unusual wooden constructions from Maramure»ô. Several art historians interpreted the features of this church. Victor BrƒÉtulescu believed that \\"in the plan entered some elements from the Russian architecture\\", but Coriolan Petranu replied him that the Russian influence \\"is not proved and hard to believe\\". According to Vasile DrƒÉgu»õ, the church from CƒÉline»ôti Susani \\"is a precious witness of the Moldavian influence in Maramure»ô\\". Marius Porumb specified that \\"the form of the plan of the wooden church from CƒÉline»ôti Susani is unusual in Maramure»ô\\" and \\"reminds the edifices with a trefoil plan from Moldavia\\". loana Cristache-Panait, an experienced scholar of the Moldavian wooden churches, stated that \\"the Moldavian carpenters, inspired by the masonry architecture, created during the 18th century a new type of plan for the wooden churches, by adding the lateral apses. ... From here, without knowing borders, the typological creation of the Moldavian carpenters passed also into Maramure»ô, at the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary from CƒÉline»ôti Susani\\". As it was remarked by others, the most distinctive feature of this construction is the plan with its lateral apses. The entrance of the church was placed on the south and its threshold is the long southern ground sill, laid first over the stones of the foundation. The western part of the narthex ends polygonal, with three short walls. At the opposite side, the sanctuary has also a polygonal shape with five outer walls. In the middle it is the nave, enlarged on both lateral sides by two polygonal apses, also with five short outer walls. Behind the iconostasis, on both sides of the sanctuary, but unobserved from outside, there are two rectangular pockets like rooms used as prothesis and diaconicon. In Moldavia, loana Cristache-Panait mentioned about 30 wooden churches with a similar trefoil plan. The church was built 7 m wide for about 95 men and 75 women, which was a medium-sized parish at that time. Inside the nave there is a choir loft that much probably was built at the same time with the church, and there can about 45 children, young men and women attend the service, apart from their parents. As in the plan, the church continues to respect the Moldavian constructive tradition in the lower part of its elevation. The lower walls were erected 3.7 m high, higher than the half of the width of the church. The uppermost timbers end outside the wall with cantilevers to support the eaves purlins of the lower roof. These cantilevers, high above the ground and shaped with numerous stylised heads of horses, arc very specific for Moldavia. The same can be said about the dimensions and the design of the portals, windows and openings in the wall between men and women. The consoles inside the nave and sanctuary, and the cross beams supporting the flat ceiling over the narthex are all adorned with filigree like decoration. The large eaves formed by the long ends of the lower rafters and the typical continuous roof over the apses and all around the church complete the list of Moldavian features. The much the lower part of the church represents the Moldavian school as much the superstructure, the double roof and the tower belong to the local constructive tradition. The contrasting fusion between the two models of wooden churches is actually the innovating feature of this church. The superstructure was superimposed on consoles above the lower fabric, designed in the west with a polygonal shape, like the western part of the narthex underneath. Two small upper windows on each long side of the nave give the church its basilica appearance. The upper frame of the roof consists of pairs of rafters tied together and stiffened by a collar. The tower was suspended above the narthex, with the four uprights supporting straight the spire of the steeple. The bell chamber is almost only an outer adornment. The church was built mainly of spruce fir timbers, but a different tree essence was used for the sills, the two portals, the frames of three large windows and for the framework of the tower. The frames of two large windows seem to be prefabricated, while the third was designed with an arched upper part topped by a cross, a motif similar with that on the portal above the entrance. The three large windows together with the small one on the west facade seem to be penetrated by the horizontal axes of the church, from east to west and from south to north, forming an invisible but present Latin cross inside the holy house. This church is more than influenced by the Moldavian sacred architecture, it is rather a Moldavian wooden church transplanted into a Maramoro»ôan village. The carpenters without doubts came here from Moldavia and accomplished a curious but successful hybrid between a typical Moldavian trefoil church and a local basilica church, with great charm, inspiring local builders later in the 20th century.

Although separated in 8 tracks, Colors gives the impression of one continuous song, with transitions between each part. Overview Colors was recorded in April through May 2007 at the Basement Studios with Jamie King as the chosen producer for it. Prior to its release, it received great praise and sold 12,600 copies in its first week of release, reaching 57th on the Billboard 200, which was the first time the band reached the top 100 on the list. Mike Portnoy, formerly of Dream Theater, one of Between the Buried and Me's main influences, named Colors his favorite album of the year. PopMatters wrote, \\"A true marvel, this challenging but ultimately highly rewarding album is an example of a young band just discovering what it‚Äôs capable of. At the rate they‚Äôre going, the modern metal pantheon awaits,\\" while Ultimate Guitar also named it \\"Best Album of the Year\\" in their annual This Year in Metal. A live DVD, titled Colors Live, was released on October 14, 2008 and includes footage from a live show on August 2, 2008 at Rocketown in Nashville, Tennessee. The song \\"Prequel to the Sequel\\" is featured as downloadable content for the video game, Rock Band 2, though it is the radio edited version of the song, shortened to five minutes, leaving the polka verse and everything after missing. In May 2017, Between the Buried and Me announced a 10th anniversary tour of the album with The Contortionist, Polyphia, and Toothgrinder. Music The band described the album as \\"adult contemporary progressive death metal\\". Dave Donnelly of AllMusic described the music of Colors as being \\"an anomaly on the otherwise more conservative, pop-punk and hardcore oriented Victory Records label\\" noting that the group \\"play a progressive style of extreme metal\\" which incorporated a range of styles. Loudwire commented about the song \\"Ants of the Sky\\": \\"The 13-minute track weaves in and out of demented carnival metal, psychedelic solos, smooth jazz guitar, space rock and a goddamn country hoedown‚Ä¶ not to mention the most tear-jerkingly beautiful solo of Paul Waggoner‚Äôs career.\\" Promotion Two weeks before the release of Colors, the band released a series of videos for the songs. The videos consisted of clips from classic films, and each video was shown for one day before being removed.

He was a son-in- law and copyist of Johann Sebastian Bach. Biography He was born in Berna bei Seidenberg, Oberlausitz, and first educated at the Lauban Lyceum in 1733. He was employed as a singer and assistant organist at St Maria Magdalena, Breslau, between 1740 and 1744. He began studying theology at the University of Leipzig from March 1744, after being granted four thalers as a viaticum in January of that year. From Michaelmas 1745 he sang as a bass in Johann Sebastian Bach's choirs (asserted by Bach in May 1747 when Altnickol claimed a grant of 12 thalers in April/May 1747 for the work), something he should not have been allowed to do as a university student. He also served as a scribe for Bach. He was recommended by W. F. Bach as the successor to his post at Dresden in April 1746, with the assertion that he had studied keyboard and composition with his father, but was not awarded the appointment. He was appointed as organist and schoolmaster at Niederwiesa, near Greiffenberg, Silesia, in January 1748, after Bach testified that he was a satisfactory student. In September of that year, he moved to a post at St Wenzel, Naumburg, after another recommendation from Bach; the council unanimously agreed to appoint him before they had received his formal application. He married Bach's daughter Elisabeth Juliane Friederica in January 1749; their first son was born in October of the same year and named Johann Sebastian, but died in infancy. Forkel wrote that Bach dictated his last chorale prelude (Vor deinen Thron tret ich hiermit, BWV 668) to Altnickol on his deathbed, although this manuscript did not survive. He acted as a trustee after Bach died in 1750, and was involved in distributing his estate. He took his brother-in-law Gottfried Heinrich Bach, believed to have been mentally handicapped, into his household, and also took on the teaching of J.G. M√ºthel. He was unsuccessful in an application for a post at the Johanniskirche, Zittau, in 1753, along with W. F. Bach. He taught trumpeter J. Ernst Altenburg in 1757, and is known to have directed a pasticcio Passion cantata Wer ist der, so von Edom k√∂mmt, featuring music by C.H. Graun, Bach and Telemann, as well as Bach's St. Matthew Passion. He was succeeded by Johann Friedrich Gr√§bner at Naumburg upon his death in 1759. His widow lived on an allowance from C. P. E. Bach, her half-brother. She is known to have remained in Naumburg until 1763, when her brother Gottfried Heinrich died; she later moved back to Leipzig, where her two daughters married; she died on 24 August 1781.

College Remediation Rate  According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 8% of the Northern Cambria High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.  Dual enrollment  The Northern Cambria High School offers a dual enrollment program in 2014. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. Three colleges are available: Mount Aloysius College, Penn Highlands Community College and Saint Francis University. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Guidelines, 2010 Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are home schooled are eligible to participate in this program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis.  Graduation requirements  Among Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts, graduation requirements widely vary. The Northern Cambria School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 22 credits to graduate, including: a required class every year in math 4 credits, English 4 credits social studies 3.5 credits, science 3.5 credits, Physical Education 2 credits, health .5 credits, Computers 2 credits, arts humanities 5.5 credits and electives.Northern Cambria School Board, Northern Cambria High School Course Descriptions 2015, 2015 Students in the class of 2019 are required to pass a total of 24.5 credits. For nearly two decades, all Pennsylvania secondary school students were required to complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the respective Keystone Exams for each course. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams.

State - 78% Enrollment According to Pennsylvania Department of Education enrollment reports, there are 1,155 students enrolled in preschool-12th in the 2014-15 school year at Northern Cambria School District. In 2007 there were 1,273 pupils. There were 88 students in the Class of 2009. The district's class of 2010 had 97 students. Enrollment at Northern Cambria School District is projected to decline to 1,144 students by 2020. In 2008, the district administrative costs were $631.64 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of small public school districts in Pennsylvania in 2007. The study found that consolidation of the administration of Northern Cambria School District with an adjacent school district, would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. The study examined consolidation of administrations with five neighboring school districts. Consolidation with Blacklick Valley School District was predicted to save $2 million in 2007. Consolidation with Cambria Heights School District would save taxpayers over $4 million in redundant administration costs. Similarly, consolidation with Harmony Area School District would save taxpayers over $2 million. consolidation with Penns Manor Area School District would save taxpayers over $2.6 million. Finally, consolidation of administrations with Purchase Line School District projected taxpayer savings of over $4 million. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes. Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any school buildings. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any school buildings. From 2000 through 2010, rural Pennsylvania public school district enrollment decreased by 8 percent. In 2010, there were 726,417 children in rural Pennsylvania, or 21 percent of the total rural population. From 2000 to 2010, the number of children in rural counties decreased 7 percent. The decline in the number of children impacted most rural counties with 42 of Pennsylvania's 48 rural counties experiencing a decline. Cameron County, Elk County and Sullivan County experienced the greatest declines, with a decrease of more than 21 percent in all three counties. Cambria County's live birth rate was 1,897 births in 1990. Cambria County's live birth rate in 2000 was 1,569 births, while in 2011 the birth rate had continued to decline to 1,374 babies.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Birth Age County Reports 1990 and 2011, 2011 Over the past 50 years (1960 to 2010), rural Pennsylvania saw a steady decline in both the number and proportion of residents under 18 years old. In 1960, 1.06 million rural residents, or 35 percent of the rural population, were children. Pennsylvania's birth rate has been declining for two decades. According to data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, in 1990, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's birth rate was 171,053.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 1990 In 2000, Pennsylvania's birth rate was 145,874.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 2000 Finally in 2011, the State's birth rate declined further to 142,021.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Health Statistics - Resident Live Birth rate by county, 2013 From 2000 to 2009, the number of babies born in rural counties declined 5 percent.Center for Rural Pennsylvania, Number of Children Decreasing, Number of Seniors Increasing in Rural Pennsylvania, July 2011 Urban counties have also experienced a decline in the number of school aged children. From 2000-2010 urban Pennsylvania counties had a 3 percent decline in the number of residents under 18 years old. In 2010, there were 2.07 million residents, or 22 percent of the urban population, who were under age 18.Pennsylvania Department of Health, Birth Statistics, 2013 Pennsylvania had 2,361 public school districts in 1959. The state compelled mergers reducing the number to 505 by 1980. Mergers slowed through the 1980s after a 1981 court order desegregated and combined the Edgewood, General Braddock, Swissvale, Churchill and Turtle Creek districts into the Woodland Hills district. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.2009‚Äì2010 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor, 2010 In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any school buildings. Special education In December 2013, the district administration reported that 159 pupils, or 13.9% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 47.8% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the District administration reported that 182 pupils, or 14.7% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 57% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-2011 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. While Northern Cambria School District has seen decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, it has yielded no savings. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding was in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. Northern Cambria School District received a $747,682 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. For the 2014-2015 school year, Northern Cambria School District received an increase to $760,311 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. Gifted education Northern Cambria School District Administration reported that 27 or 2.21% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness are also considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 The latest teacher union contract governs years 2014-2018 inclusive. The taxpayers pay 100% of the cost of the employee's health insurance. There is limited spousal coverage. In 2013, the average teacher salary in Northern Cambria School District was $55,643.08 a year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in Pennsylvania Students2013, 2013Pennsylvania Department of Education, Northern Cambria School District Fast Facts Financial Information 2014, 2014 The District employed 114 teachers with a top salary of $102,500. Northern Cambria School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, a teacher can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2009, Northern Cambria School District reported employing 96 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $60,537 and a top salary of $122,120. The teacher's work day is 7.5 hours with 184 days in the contract year. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, 2 paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, paid bereavement leave, paid sabbatical leave (50% of salary and benefits for one year) and other benefits. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.PA Delaware County Times, Teachers need to know enough is enough, April 20, 2010. Administrative spending Northern Cambria School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $631.64 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 The Pennsylvania School Boards Association collects and maintains statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. In 2013, High School principal, Joy Tibbott was moved to the administrative offices as Director of Education as part of lawsuit settlement. She was to hold the position through 2014-15 school year. Per-pupil spending In 2008, Northern Cambria School District administration reported that per-pupil spending was $11,562 which ranked 333rd among Pennsylvania's then 501 public school districts.

The U.S. Census Bureau reported that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year 2000-01. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was reported as $12,759. Among the fifty states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. Pennsylvania's total revenue per pupil rose to $16,186 ranking 9th in the nation in 2011. Reserves In 2008, Northern Cambria School District reported a balance of $1,463,867, in its unreserved-undesignated fund. The unreserved-designated fund balance was reported as zero. In 2010, Northern Cambria School District Administration reported an increase to $1,879,629 in the unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The district also reported zero in its unreserved-designated fund in 2010. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2005, the total reserve funds held by Pennsylvania public school districts was $1.9 billion. By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion.

In 2009 Northern Cambria Community Development Corp. owed $136,533on the former Miners Hospital property. The land was listed on the Cambria County delinquent property tax sale list. State Audits In January 2014, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the school board and the district's administration. The findings found significant issues with conflict of interest ethics violations by a school board member. In August 2010, Auditor General Wagner found the District had corrected issues regarding failing to bill nonresident students for tuition. Tuition Students who live within the Northern Cambria School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Northern Cambria School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Northern Cambria School District schools. The 2013 tuition rates are Elementary School - $9,060, High School - $9,992. Northern Cambria School District is funded by a combination of: a Local Services Tax - $5, a local earned income tax 0.5%, per capita taxes, Public Utility Taxes, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a small amount, generally 10% of its budget from the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. State basic education funding According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Northern Cambria School District receives 75.6% of its annual revenue from the state. This exceeds the goal of the state providing 50% of district funding. For the 2014-15 school year, Northern Cambria School District received $8,469,189 in State Basic Education funding.

The State is paying $500.8 million to Social Security on the school employees behalf and another $1.16 billion to the state teachers pension system (PSERS). In total, Pennsylvania's Education budget for K-12 public schools is $10 billion. This was a $305 million increase over 2013-2014 state spending and the greatest amount ever allotted by the Commonwealth for its public schools.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-15 Enacted Education Budget Fast Facts, July 14, 2014 In the 2013-2014 school year, Northern Cambria School District received a 1.2% increase or $8,469,774 in Pennsylvania Basic Education Funding.

In 2010, Head Start received $37.6 million in Pennsylvania state education dollars. Since 2003, Pennsylvania has more than doubled the number of preschoolers in publicly funded pre-kindergarten through a multipronged system including: school-based pre-kindergarten, Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts through private providers, Early Intervention, Head Start and Head Start Supplemental, and the school district's use of Accountability Block Grants. Over 100,000 Pennsylvania preschoolers participate in state taxpayer funded pre-kindergarten programs. In 2013, the federal government spent $8 billion for preschool programs nationwide. In 2013, Pennsylvania was awarded a $51.7 million federal grant to fund early learning programs. The funding will be used to create 50 Early Childhood Education Community Innovation Zones in areas where the lowest- performing public schools, including charter schools, exist. The federal dollars were not be used to provide seats for children in preschools. Instead the money was used to build state bureaucracy and added training for teachers/providers. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The School District applied to participate in 2006-07, but was denied funding by PA Education Secretary Gerald Zahorchak. In 2007-08 and in 2008-09 did not apply for funding in spite of repeated requests from the board to do so. Among the public school districts in Cambria County, the highest award was given to Greater Johnstown School District which received $463,166. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Science It‚Äôs Elementary grant Northern Cambria Elementary School successfully applied to participate and received a Science It's Elementary grant in 2008-09. For the 2008-09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 66,973 students across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program was a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills.Patricia Vathis Pennsylvania Department of Education, Grants and Subsidies Science: It‚Äôs Elementary, 2006 To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010-11 Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Application Guidelines, July 2010 The district was required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. The school district administration was required to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3,000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated for the program. The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. The grant was discontinued in the state's 2011 budget by Governor Edward G. Rendell. Education Assistance Grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11 the Northern Cambria School District received $24,245.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Educational Assistance Program Funding 2010-2011 Fiscal Year, 2010 In 2003-04, Governor Rendell signed into law the EAP for targeted tutoring at a funding level of $38 million. Almost 35,000 students in 82 academically challenged school districts received extra help in the first year. The program was continued at the same funding level in 2004-05. In 2005-06, the program received $66 million in funding and expanded to support tutoring in 175 school districts and Career and Technical Centers. Hybrid Learning grants Northern Cambria School District participated in a pilot year of the state's Hybrid learning initiative. Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning uses three learning models to increase student achievement: instruction from the teacher, group activities, and self-instruction through digital content. According to state testing results, among the pilot schools, 88 percent achieved higher academic performance in hybrid classes compared to traditional classes in the same district or statewide benchmarks, 75 percent reported better academic achievement, and all of them met or exceeded academic growth. In 2013-14, the state awarded $633,000 in federal Title 2A funds to accelerate teacher training in the implementation of hybrid learning programs in 50 school buildings in 34 school entities. In 2012, $1.1 million was awarded to 15 districts to launch the first hybrid pilot schools in the state that included more than 1,900 students and 48 teachers.Pennsylvania Department of Education press release, Governor Corbett Announces $633,000 in Hybrid Learning Grants to 34 School Entities, May 28, 2013 Northern Cambria School District received $19,500. Other grants Northern Cambria School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant; 2013 Safe Schools and Resource Officer grants; Project 720 High School Reform grants (discontinued effective with 2011-12 budget); nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. Federal Stimulus grant The Northern Cambria School District received an extra $2,027,455 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students.Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Cambria County ARRA FUNDING Report, 2009 The funding was limited to the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Northern Cambria School District officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. Common Cents state initiative Northern Cambria School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Common Cents program - Making Every Dollar Count, 2007 After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Local Services Tax All local taxing authorities are required by the Local Tax Enabling Act to exempt disabled veterans and members of the armed forces reserve who are called to active duty at any time during the tax year from any local services tax and to exempt from any local services tax levied at a rate in excess of $10 those persons whose total income and net profits from all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for the tax year. The Local Tax Enabling Act also authorizes, but does not require, taxing authorities to exempt from per capita, occupation, and earned income taxes and any local services tax levied at a rate of $10 or less per year, any person whose total income from all sources is less than $12,000 per year. Real estate taxes Property tax rates in 2014-2015 were set by the school board at 50.1600 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013-14 - 47.0000 mills *2012-13 - 47.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 47.0000 mills. *2010-11 - 47.0000 mills. *2009-10 - 43.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008-09 - 43.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 40.9890 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 39.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 39.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Cambria County residents amounts to about 2.4% of their yearly income.

According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Pennsylvania's 2011 tax burden of 10.35% ranked 10th highest out of 50 states. The tax burden was above the national average of 9.8%. Pennsylvania's taxpayers paid $4,374 per capita in state and local taxes, including school taxes.Tax Foundation, The facts on Pennsylvania‚Äôs Tax Climate, January 2015 Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above their annual Act 1 Index unless they either: allow the district's voters to approve the increase through a vote by referendum or they receive an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the school year is published by the PDE in the fall of each year. Each individual school district's Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as local property values and the personal income of district residents. Originally, Act 1 of 2006 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. Property tax relief In 2014, Northern Cambria School District approved 2,345 homestead properties to receive $134 each. The decline in amount was related to more residents applying for tax relief and a decline in table games tax revenues. The amount received by the district must be divided equally among all approved residences. In 2009, Northern Cambria School District approved 2,307 homestead properties to receive $136 in property tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The amount of property tax relief each Pennsylvania public school district receives is announced by the PDE in May of each year. The amount of tax relief is dependent on the total tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. Thirty-five percent of the slots tax revenues are used for property tax relief. In Cambria County, the highest tax relief went to Ferndale Area School District which was set at $214.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2009. The highest property tax relief provided, among Pennsylvania school districts, goes to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District in Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester- Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The tax relief was started by Governor Edward G. Rendell with passage of the state gaming law in 2004. Rendell promised taxpayers substantial property tax relief from legalized gambling. In Cambria County, 54% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. This was among the lowest participation rates in Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, the homestead exclusion reduces the assessed values of homestead properties, reducing the property tax on these homes. The homestead exclusion allows homeowners real property tax relief of up to one half of the median assessed value of homesteads in the taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, city, borough, or township). Some Northern Cambria School District residents, including: low income residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older, can qualify for the state's Property Tax/Rent Rebate program. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. Residents must apply annually to receive up to $650. The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Nutrition/Wellness policy Northern Cambria School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Northern Cambria School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 The District also offers the Seamless Summer Food program to all children without charge. In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non-subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Northern Cambria School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in the buildings to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Highmark Healthy High 5 grant In 2014, Northern Cambria School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Northern Cambria Elementary School received $5,000 which was used to purchase the Healthy Beginnings Program to promote student wellness.Highmark Foundation, 2014 School Challenge Grants, 2014 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools.

They beat Union(Rimersburg) in the first round. Tony Rocco led the Colts that game with 20 points and 11 steals. In the round of 16 they lost to Rocky Grove. 2010 Boys A Basketball Round of 32 The 2010 team won the Heritage Conference and playoffs looked bright. However, in the first round they played Reading Central Catholic, the favored team in the state tournament to win. They kept the game close with a gap of just 7 going into the 4th quarter, but Reading deemed too much for the Colts. Northern Cambria shot a horrid 9%(3-31) from the 3-pt line, usually their specialty, or they might have pulled off the upset. Marcus Dawkins, a member of Reading Central Catholic, dunked on Joe Yuhas's head in the game and also threw the ball of the backboard to himself on a fast break and dunked it. Marcus Dawkins is black. This team also won the Cambria Heights Christmas basketball tournament in 2009. Named to the all-tourney team was Anthony Penksa, Josh Stiles, and Tony Rocco. Left off of the all-tourney was Joe Yuhas. To this day Joe is still salty about the whole ordeal. He weeps alone in his room for hours and hours when thinking back. 2008 Girls AA Basketball State Runner-Up The 2008 team became the first girls basketball team at the school to make the state playoffs.

His name continued to be used by several different piano manufacturers through the 1950s, and was filed independently as a trademark for musical instruments in 2005 and 2008. Worms rightFrederick Mathushek was born in Mannheim, in Baden, June 9, 1814, and apprenticed with a pianomaker of that city until the age of 17, when he travelled visiting piano making facilities in Germany, Austria, Russia, and eventually Paris, before establishing his own workshop in Worms, where he built pianos influenced by those he had seen in the factory of Jean-Henri Pape. New York, 1850s Mathushek's 1851 patentIn 1849 Mathushek emigrated to New York (after holding a prominent position with Erard in London, according to his obituary), and worked for John B. Dunham, who was one of the first piano manufacturers to introduce overstringing in America several years earlier.Spillane, p.183-184 Alfred Dolge wrote Mathushek perfected a simplified press for applying felt covering to piano hammers in 1850, and in 1851 he patented a method for overstringing in cast iron frame square pianos to allow a greater number of strings with larger diameters.F. Mathushek.

Mathushek started his own workshop in New York in 1852, and that year listed his address at 118 East 21st street. By 1856 he was listed at 188 Mercer and 72 Prince, and at 252 Fourth street from 1858 through 1861.Trow's New York City Directory John F. Trow, New York 1855, 1856, 1857, 1858, 1859, 1860, 1861 Piano historians Daniel Spillane and Alfred Dolge wrote that by 1857 he had been engaged to bring some of Spencer B. Driggs' designs to practical form. Driggs had moved to New York from Detroit, Michigan in 1856 after patenting his linguine repeating attachment, and campaigned to improve the piano through a series of patents he concentrated around the construction of violins. The identifying feature was the use of two un-barred sounding boards, one of which was meant to form the bottom of the instrument instead of the usual heavy wooden base or frame, and they were intended to be bent into arches to increase their stiffness and coupled using a sound post. By late 1859 Mathushek was associated with lawyer Wellington Wells, and coassigned him patents for a repetition action and grand pianos.F. Mathushek. Piano Action. United States Patent 26,550, December 20, 1859; F. Mathushek. Piano.

Life Early life Poynter was educated at the English College at Douai, where he was ordained in 1786. He remained as professor, and afterwards prefect of studies till the college was suppressed during the French Revolution.Ward, Bernard. \\"William Poynter.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 11 January 2019 After undergoing eighteen months imprisonment, the collegians were set free, and returned to England in March, 1795. Poynter with the students from the South of England went to Old Hall at Ware, Hertfordshire, where he took a leading part in the foundation of St. Edmund's College, being first vice-president, then (1801‚Äì13) president. Apostolic vicar In 1803, in light of the declining health of Bishop John Douglass, vicar apostolic of the London district, Poynter was appointed titular bishop of Halia and coadjutor vicar apostolic, remaining at the same time president of the college. He was consecrated bishop by Bishop Douglass on 29 May 1803. On the death of Bishop Douglass in 1812, Bishop Poynter succeeded as vicar apostolic.Phillips, Peter, ed., The Diaries of Bishop William Poynter, V.A. (1815-1824, Catholic Record Society (London, 2006), Introduction, at p.6. His position was rendered difficult by the persistent attacks of Bishop John Milner, vicar apostolic of the Midlands District, in pamphlets and in his pastorals, covering a range of disputes but mostly centred on the question of Catholic Emancipation and the demands of the British government to control the appointment of Catholic bishops in Great Britain. An unrelated dispute arose when Poynter put restrictions on the writings of Peter Gandolphy which Milner then allowed in his vicariate.Geoffrey Holt, article on Gandolphy in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Poynter endured Milner's accusations in silence, having the support of all the other English and Scotch bishops; but when in May 1814, on the issue of the Quarantotti Rescript, Milner went to Rome to obtain its reversal, Poynter followed him there and wrote his Apologetical Epistle defending himself to the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide. Quarantotti's Rescript was withdrawn, and in its place was substituted a Letter to Dr. Poynter, dated from Genoa, where the pope had taken refuge during the Hundred Days that ensued upon Napoleon Bonaparte's escape from exile on Elba. A limited veto for the British Crown upon the appointment of bishops was sanctioned, but the exequatur was refused. Milner was directed to abstain from publishing pastorals or pamphlets against Poynter. He obeyed this injunction, but continued his attacks in letters to the Orthodox Journal until he was peremptorily prohibited by order of the pope, under pain of being deposed. During his episcopate Poynter paid four visits to Paris of several months each (1814, 15, 17, and 22), with the object of reclaiming the property of the colleges at Douai and elsewhere, which had been confiscated during the Revolution. He received the support of the Duke of Wellington and Lord Castlereagh, and of the British commissioners appointed to deal with the claims. He succeeded eventually in recovering the colleges themselves and about ¬£30,000 which had been kept in the names of the bishops, but the main claim amounting to ¬£120,000 was lost. The French paid it to the British commissioners, but these refused to hand it over, on the plea that it would be applied to purposes considered by English law as \\"superstitious\\".Firmly I Believe and Truly: The Spiritual Tradition of Catholic England, (John Saward, John Morrill, Michael Tomko, eds.), OUP Oxford, 2013, p. 365 The final decision was given in November, 1825.

He played one season for the Cincinnati Bengals and one season for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the National Football League. He played in 14 games in 1977 with Cincinnati and two games in 1978 with Tampa Bay, but never recorded an interception. He then played for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League in 1980 and 1981. Following his career, he was viewed as a hero by his family and community. On May 27, 1984, he rescued some trapped motorists from floodwaters in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Even though Anderson pulled two people from Dirty Butter Creek, he felt guilty that he was unable to save a third person, Bridgette Johnson, from a submerged car that day. Exactly five years later, on May 27, 1989, in his hometown of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Anderson took Dwight Ogleton, Jr. and another boy fishing on the Stones River, which had been bloated by heavy rains. Brad Logsdon and Josh McFarland were fishing on a nearby dam when they were overtaken by the water. McFarland fell in. Logsdon extended a hand to grab McFarland and he then fell in too. Anderson managed to rescue both boys but went underwater two or three times and never resurfaced. He died five months shy of his 36th birthday and was buried June 3, 1989, at Green Acres Cemetery north of Tulsa. Rescue workers pulled him from the river and took him to Middle Tennessee Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. On October 31, 1989, the story of his heroism and death was aired on Rescue 911. About six months after Anderson's death, the local NAACP chapter named an award in his honor. The Jerry Anderson Hero and Humanitarian Awards are awarded each January to someone in the community.

He joined the NBA in 1992 and has held various positions within the league, becoming chief operating officer and deputy commissioner under his predecessor and mentor David Stern in 2006. When Stern retired in 2014, Silver was named the new commissioner. While commissioner, the league continued to grow economically and globally, especially in China. Silver made headlines in 2014 for forcing Donald Sterling to sell the Los Angeles Clippers after Sterling made racist remarks; later banning him for life from the game. Silver also received international attention for his neutral positioning of the NBA during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. Early life Silver was born into a Jewish-American family and grew up in Rye, New York, a northern suburb of New York City in Westchester County.Jerusalem Post: \\"Who was the most influential Jew in sports this past year?\\" By Uriel Sturm August 9, 2016 He attended Rye High School and graduated in 1980. After high school, Silver went to Duke University and majored in political science. He graduated in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, then worked for one year as a legislative aide to Les AuCoin, who was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1975 to 1993. Silver then attended the University of Chicago Law School, graduating in 1988 with a J.D. degree. After law school, Silver clerked for one year for Judge Kimba Wood of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and then joined the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore as an associate. NBA career Prior to becoming commissioner, Silver was the NBA's Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer for eight years. In that role, he was involved in the negotiation of the league's last three collective bargaining agreements with the National Basketball Players Association, the development of the WNBA and NBA Development League, the partnership with Turner Broadcasting to manage the NBA's digital assets, and the creation of NBA China. Previously, Silver spent eight years as President and COO of NBA Entertainment. Since joining the NBA in 1992, Silver has also held the positions of Senior VP & COO, NBA Entertainment, NBA Chief of Staff, and Special Assistant to the Commissioner. During his time with NBA Entertainment, Silver was an executive producer of the IMAX movie Michael Jordan to the Max, as well as the documentary Whatever Happened to Micheal Ray? He also worked on the production side of Like Mike and Year of the Yao.  Commissioner  On October 25, 2012, he was endorsed by David Stern to be the next NBA Commissioner when Stern announced that he would step down on February 1, 2014. On April 25, 2014, TMZ Sports released a video of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling holding a conversation with his girlfriend that included racist remarks. Silver responded on April 29, 2014, announcing that Sterling had been banned from the NBA for life. In addition, Silver fined Sterling $2.5 million, the maximum allowed under the NBA constitution. Silver stripped Sterling from virtually all of his authority over the Clippers, and urged owners to vote to expel Sterling from ownership of the Clippers. Sterling was disallowed from entering any Clippers facility as well as attending any NBA games. It was one of the most severe punishments ever imposed on a professional sports owner. On November 13, 2014, Silver published an op-ed piece in The New York Times, where he announced that he is in favor of legalized and regulated sports betting, mentioning that it should be \\"brought out of the underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated.\\" On October 4, 2019, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey issued a tweet that supported the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. Morey later deleted the tweet. On October 6, Morey and the NBA each issued a separate statement addressing the original tweet; Morey said that he never intended his tweet to cause any offense while the NBA said the tweet was \\"regrettable.\\" The statements drew attention and subsequent bipartisan criticism from several US politicians. On October 7, Silver defended league's response to the tweet, supporting Morey's right to freedom of expression while also accepting the right of reply from the government of and businesses from China. Soon after, Silver faced a risk between the partnership of China and the NBA. China responded negatively with decisions to possibly cut ties from the NBA. Silver publicly said, \\"It is inevitable that people around the world‚Äîincluding from America and China‚Äîwill have different viewpoints over different issues. . . . It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\\" Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo responded to Silver's statements, stating, \\"Vivo has always insisted on the principle that the national interest is above all else and firmly opposes any remark and behavior that constitutes a challenge to the national sovereignty and territorial integrity. . . . Starting today, Vivo will suspend all cooperation with the NBA.\\" On March 11, 2020, Silver made the decision to suspend the 2019-20 NBA season in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 4, 2020, it was announced that the season would resume for 22 of the 30 teams in the NBA Bubble, a $170 million investment to protect the players, the coaches, and the successful completion of the season. Near the end of the regular season, Silver stated that the bubble was \\"better than what we had envisioned.\\" Honors In 2016, Sports Business Journal ranked Silver No. 1 on its list of the 50 Most Influential People in Sports Business. In 2015, Silver was named Executive of the Year by Sports Business Journal. That year he was also named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People and one of Fortune's 50 Greatest Leaders.

After studying law, he was admitted to the bar in 1862 and commenced practice in Edwardsville, Illinois. He enlisted in the Union Army on August 12, 1862. He was promoted to second lieutenant, Company G, 117th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, in 1863 and to first lieutenant in 1864. He served as member of the Illinois House of Representatives in 1868, serving until 1870.Benjamin Gue, \\"History of Iowa: From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century,\\" vol. IV, p. 153 (1903). In 1870 he moved to Grundy Center, Iowa, where he continued to practice law, and also farmed. He was a school director in 1875. Kerr was elected mayor of Grundy Center in 1877. He was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives in 1883. In 1886, ran for the Republican nomination to Congress in the Fifth Iowa District. His money did him no harm; nor did owning the Grundy Center Argus, a Republican newspaper. A bitter fight in the convention left bruised feelings all around, and the leading Republican newspaper in Cedar Rapids, the Evening Gazette, charged the money-changers had brought about Kerr's nomination. Kerr could counter by pointing to his battle against jobbery in the Illinois legislature and still more to the advantages he had brought to his community in pushing the Burlington railroad into the northwestern counties of the state. Kerr's own known prohibitionist leanings harmed him seriously among the German Republicans in Cedar Rapids, but made up for it among Republican farmers in the drier countryside. Most of all, the incumbent Democratic congressman, Benjamin Frederick, found it impossible to rein in a savagely-divided and ill- natured party.Dubuque Daily Herald, June 12, 1886; Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette, August 24, 30, November 26, 1886. Kerr was elected as a Republican to the Fiftieth Congress, unseating incumbent Democrat Benjamin T. Frederick. After re-election in 1888 and service in the Fifty-first Congress, he declined to run for a third term in 1890. In all, he served in Congress from March 4, 1887 to March 3, 1891. After leaving Congress, Kerr resumed the practice of law. Kerr had served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1888 and 1896.

While it is particularly known for work in Power generation, its customers come from many industries across a wide geographical regions, and problems are solved using a variety of engineering techniques. Thus, the company is best defined by the type of problems solved, rather than by traditional industry or consultant categories. History The company was formed as Business Aircraft Consulting Services in 1975 by Robert Gielow and James Paul, two Professional Engineers with backgrounds in the aerospace industry. They quickly realized that the knowledge they had gained working on projects such as the Apollo program moon rockets could be used to advance a wide variety of industries. Joining with Robert Nelson they soon changed the name of the company to Airflow Sciences Corporation to more closely reflect the services offered. In 1994 ASC was purchased by Ricardo plc, an automotive consulting firm based in Shoreham-by- Sea, England. This arrangement proved less than satisfying to both sides, so, after two years, management repurchased the company. Since then, ASC has continued to expand its client base and diversify the tools it has on hand to solve a variety of industrial fluid flow problems. Problems Solved by ASC ASC works with its customer's internal engineers to solve problems involving the flow of fluids (gases or liquids) in or around a wide variety of equipment or goods. Some problems include simply the flow itself. These include such things as reducing pressure drop, eliminating flow induced vibrations, or ensuring uniform flow through an equipment that processes elements of the flow (e.g., pollution reduction equipment such as a catalyst or an electrostatic precipitator). Since fluid flow carries energy, heat transfer problems such as improving thermal mixing or heating/cooling characteristics are often solved. Similarly, ASC undertakes many problems involving the pneumatic transport of particulate. The chemical reactions in a flowing gas or liquid are also the subject of ASC studies. Methods used to solve these problems include: Numerical simulation (including Computational fluid dynamics), Wind tunnel testing, Laboratory modeling (including Scale models), and Field testing. Customer Base ASC customers include manufacturing and processing firms from a wide variety of industries, including: *Power generation * Food processing * Manufacturing (especially involving heat treatment) * Home appliances * Portland cement and chemical industry * Pulp and paper industry * Sports teams (bobsleigh, bicycling) and sports equipment manufacturers * Steel producers * Automotive industry and auto racing companies * Class I railroads and railcar companies * Biotechnology firms Customers include Fortune 1000 companies, such as Ford Motor Company, Duke Energy, Norfolk Southern, Kellogg, Southern Company, Goodyear, and hundreds more.

Quiney held several municipal offices in the corporation of Stratford-upon-Avon, the highest being chamberlain in 1621 and 1622, but was also fined for various minor offences. In 1616, Quiney married Judith Shakespeare. The marriage took place during a season when a special licence was required by the church, and the couple had failed to obtain one, leading to Quiney's brief excommunication. Quiney was also summoned before the Bawdy Court less than two months after the wedding to answer charges of \\"carnal copulation\\" with a Margaret Wheeler, who died in childbirth. Scholars believe that as a result of these events William Shakespeare altered his will to favour his other daughter, Susanna Hall, and excluded Quiney from his inheritance. Judith and Thomas had three children: Shakespeare, Richard, and Thomas. Shakespeare Quiney died at six months of age, and neither Richard nor Thomas lived past 21. The death of Judith's last child led to legal wrangling over William Shakespeare's will that lasted until 1652. Scholars speculate that Thomas Quiney may have died in 1662 or 1663 when the burial records are incomplete. Birth and early life Quiney family coat of arms. \\"Or, on a bend sable, three trefoils slipped argent.\\" Thomas Quiney was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised on 26 February 1589 in Holy Trinity Church. He was the son of Richard and Elizabeth Quiney. He had 10 siblings, among them a Richard Quiney who was a grocer in London, Mary Quiney who later married Richard Watts, the vicar of Harbury, and Elizabeth Quiney who married William Chandler. There is no record of Thomas Quiney's attendance at the local school, but he had sufficient education to write short passages in French, run a business, and hold several municipal offices in his life. Business and municipal offices Quiney was a vintner and dealt in tobacco. He held the lease to a house known as \\"Atwood's\\" for the purpose of running a tavern, and later traded houses with his brother-in-law, William Chandler, for the larger house known as \\"The Cage\\" where he set up his vintner's shop in the upper half. He is recorded as selling wine to the corporation of Stratford- upon-Avon as late as 1650. Facsimile of Quiney's couplet in French for the accounts of 1622‚Äì23. He was a man of some education, with knowledge of French and calligraphy. In signing his accounts for 1621 and 1622 as chamberlain he decorated them with a couplet in French from a romance by Mellin de Saint- Gelais. Quiney writes \\"Bien heureux est celui qui pour devenir sage, Qui pour le mal d'autrui fait son apprentissage\\" but the original is \\"Heureux celui qui pour devenir sage, Du mal d'autrui fait son apprentissage\\". The original translates into English as \\"Happy is he who to become wise, serves his apprenticeship from other men's troubles\\" but Quiney's version \\"‚Ä¶ is ungrammatical and without sense\\". Facsimile of Quiney's signature \\"with flourishes\\" from the accounts of 1622‚Äì23. He was a well-respected man in the borough, and was elected a burgess and constable in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1617. In 1621 and 1662 he was acting Chamberlain. In signing his accounts for 1622‚Äì23, he did so \\"with flourishes\\", but the records show that the council voted them \\"imperfect\\". Quiney did not attend this meeting, but he did attend the later meeting where the accounts were passed, so they appear to have needed further explanation. Quiney's reputation was slightly spotted; he was fined for swearing and for \\"suffering townsmen to tipple in his house\\", and was at one point in danger of prosecution for \\"dispensing unwholesome and adulterated wine\\". Marriage Holy Trinity Church, Stratford upon Avon, where Thomas was married. View from the opposite bank of the River Avon. On 10 February 1616, Thomas Quiney married Judith Shakespeare, William Shakespeare's daughter, in Holy Trinity Church. The assistant vicar, Richard Watts, who later married Quiney's sister Mary, probably officiated. The wedding took place during the Lenten season, which was prohibited. In 1616 Lent started on 23 January, Septuagesima Sunday, and ended on 7 April, the Sunday after Easter. The marriage therefore required a special licence, issued by the Bishop of Worcester, which the couple had failed to obtain. A Walter Wright of Stratford was cited for marrying without either banns or licence, so since Quiney was only cited for marrying without the required licence it is presumed that they had posted banns in church. The infraction was a minor one, apparently caused by the minister, as three other couples were also wed that February. Quiney was nevertheless summoned by Walter Nixon to appear before the Consistory court in Worcester. (This same Walter Nixon was later involved in a Star Chamber case and was found guilty of forging signatures and taking bribes). Quiney failed to appear by the required date. The register recorded the judgement, which was excommunication, on or about 12 March 1616. It is unknown if Judith was also excommunicated, but in any case the punishment did not last long. In November of the same year they were back in church for the baptism of their firstborn child. The marriage did not begin well: Quiney had recently impregnated another woman, Margaret Wheeler, who was to die in childbirth along with the child and was buried on 15 March 1616. On 26 March 1616, Quiney appeared before the Bawdy Court, which dealt, among other things, with \\"whoredom and uncleanliness\\". Confessing in open court to \\"carnal copulation\\" with Margaret Wheeler, he submitted himself for correction. He was sentenced to open penance \\"in a white sheet (according to custom)\\" before the congregation on three Sundays. He also had to admit to his crime, this time wearing ordinary clothes, before the Minister of Bishopton in Warwickshire. The first part of the sentence was remitted, essentially letting him off with a five-shilling fine to be given to the parish's poor. Since Bishopton only had a chapel, he was spared any public humiliation. Chapel Lane, Atwood's and The Cage Where the Quineys lived after being married is unknown. Judith owned her father's cottage on Chapel Lane, Stratford, while Thomas had held, since 1611, the lease on a tavern called \\"Atwood's\\" on High Street. The cottage later passed from Judith to her sister as part of the settlement in their father's will. In July 1616 Thomas swapped houses with his brother-in- law, William Chandler, moving his vintner's shop to the upper half of a house at the corner of High Street and Bridge Street. Known as \\"The Cage\\", it is the house traditionally associated with Judith Quiney. In the 20th century The Cage was for a time a Wimpy restaurant before being turned into the Stratford Information Office. The Cage provides further insight into why Shakespeare would not have trusted Judith's husband. Around 1630 Quiney tried to sell the lease on the house but was prevented by his kinsmen. In 1633, to protect the interests of Judith and the children, the lease was signed over to the trust of three relatives: John Hall, Susanna's husband; Thomas Nash, the husband of Judith's niece; and Richard Watts, vicar of nearby Harbury, who was Quiney's brother-in-law and who had officiated at Thomas and Judith's wedding. Eventually, in November 1652, the lease to The Cage ended up in the hands of Thomas' eldest brother, Richard Quiney, a grocer in London. William Shakespeare's last will and testament Nash's House, standing adjacent to the site of New Place The inauspicious beginnings of Judith's marriage, in spite of her husband and his family being otherwise unexceptionable, has led to speculation that this was the cause for William Shakespeare's hastily altered last will and testament. He first summoned his lawyer, Francis Collins, in January 1616. On 25 March he made further alterations, probably because he was dying and because of his concerns about Quiney. In the first bequest of the will there had been a provision \\"vnto my sonne in L[aw]\\"; but \\"sonne in L[aw]\\" was then struck out, with Judith's name inserted in its stead. To this daughter he bequeathed ¬£100 \\"in discharge of her marriage porcion\\"; another ¬£50 if she were to relinquish the Chapel Lane cottage; and, if she or any of her children were still alive at the end of three years following the date of the will, a further ¬£150, of which she was to receive the interest but not the principal. This money was explicitly denied to Thomas Quiney unless he were to bestow on Judith lands of equal value. In a separate bequest, Judith was given \\"my broad silver gilt bole\\". Finally, for the bulk of his estate, which included his main house, \\"New Place\\", his two houses on Henley Street and various lands in and around Stratford, Shakespeare had set up an entail. His estate was bequeathed, in descending order of choice, to the following: 1) his daughter, Susanna Hall; 2) upon Susanna's death, \\"to the first sonne of her bodie lawfullie yssueing & to the heires Males of the bodie of the saied first Sonne lawfullie yssueing\\"; 3) to Susanna's second son and his male heirs; 4) to Susanna's third son and his male heirs; 5) to Susanna's \\"ffourth ... ffyfth sixte & Seaventh sonnes\\" and their male heirs; 6) to Elizabeth, Susanna and John Hall's firstborn, and her male heirs; 7) to Judith and her male heirs; or 8) to whatever heirs the law would normally recognise. This elaborate entail is usually taken to indicate that Thomas Quiney was not to be entrusted with Shakespeare's inheritance, although some have speculated that it may simply indicate that Susanna was the favoured child. Children Judith and Thomas Quiney had three children: Shakespeare (baptised 23 November 1616 ‚Äì buried 8 May 1617); Richard (baptised 9 February 1618 ‚Äì buried 6 February 1639); and Thomas (baptised 23 January 1620 ‚Äì buried 28 January 1639). Shakespeare was named for his mother's father. Richard's name was common among the Quineys: his other grandfather and an uncle were both named Richard. Shakespeare Quiney died at six months of age. Richard and Thomas Quiney were buried within a month of each other; they were 19 and 21 years old, respectively. The deaths of all of Judith's children brought on new legal consequences. The entail on her father's inheritance led Susanna, along with her daughter and son-in-law, to make a settlement, by use of a rather elaborate legal device, for the inheritance of her own branch of the family. Legal wrangling continued for another thirteen years, until 1652. Death Of Thomas Quiney's fate the records show little. It is speculated that he may have died in 1662 or 1663 when the parish burial records are incomplete. He certainly had a nephew in London, who by this time held the lease to The Cage.

However, Carlisle Centurions failed to complete the 2005 National League Three because of travelling difficulties causing serious player-availability issues. The club was reformed in 2006 under coach Geoff Grieves and returned to the Rugby League Conference in 2006 joining the North Division.

In both 2007 and 2008 the club lost out at the National semi-final stage to Coventry Bears and Nottingham Outlaws, suffering for a lack of genuine competition in the Northern Premier competition. In 2009, they returned to National League Three reconstituted as the Rugby League Conference National Division. Former Workington Town player Dennis Bibby became coach after Grieves left mid-season.

It is located in the far south of the country, just near the borders with France and Luxembourg. It is a French speaking city, though the traditional language is Luxembourgish. The poet and novelist Hubert Juin (1926‚Äì1987) was born in Athus. The city was famous during the 19th and 20th century because of its steelworks factory which closed in the 1970s.  Geography  The city is surrounded by two boundaries: the one with France and the other one with Luxembourg; city was built around the Messancy river and the river Chiers, both right tributaries to the Meuse river. Directly across the border with Luxembourg is the town of Rodange and the town of P√©tange is to the east. On the French side, the main neighbouring city is Longwy in Meurthe-et-Moselle, over 5 km to the south west. Athus is situated at 200 kilometers from Brussels, 25 from Luxembourg City and 15 from Arlon.  History  H√¥tel de Ville of the municipality of Aubange, is situated in Athus Athus has always been a Germanic place though its first origins are during the Roman period. It was a little village until the 17th century when the steelworks began to develop in the whole region. It was during the 19th century that Athus started to become relatively famous in the neighborhood and especially in 1872 when the first steel factory was founded. At the same time, in 1878, Athus also became an independent commune until the reorganization of the 1970s, when it was merged with the surrounding communes to create the enlarged municipality of Aubange on 1 January 1977. But 1977 was a tragic year for the city because the factory closed its doors due to the iron and steel crisis of that moment. At that time, the city was at the top of its fame and of its number of inhabitants which reached approximately 7,500. That event led to a social and economic crisis for the city and the whole region which is not yet totally solved today. But Athus is still the biggest locality of the municipality of Aubange, and the most important because many services are still there; (the townhall, the main schools, the main bus lines stops and train station, the police station or the firehouse are examples.)  Steelworks  The container terminal of Athus, as seen from Road N830 The steelworks in Athus was founded in 1872 as the company Soci√©t√© des Hauts Fourneaux d'Athus, a blast furnace was constructed and in 1880 a steelworks. In 1882, the company became Soci√©t√© des Hauts Fourneaux et Aci√©ries d'Athus; by 1914 there were four blast furnaces, and by 1928 five. In 1927 merger with the S.A. des Aci√©ries d'Angleur et des Charbonnages belges de Tilleu formed S.A. d¬¥Angleur-Athus. In 1945 the company was taken over by the Soci√©t√© anonyme John Cockerill. Production continued until the steel works at Athus was merged with the Mini√®re et M√©tallurgique de Rodange (MMR) in 1973; restructuring as a result of the Steel crisis of the 1973‚Äì75 recession led to the complete closure of the plant in Athus in the late 1970s. The site of the plant is now a rail-served container terminal which deals with containers from the ports of the North Sea to the interior of France, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.  Demographics  The Place verte (the green square), location of Athus's first religious monument, a chapel, built in the 16th century. Athus had a population of 7227 inhabitants in January 2012.

It is connected hourly to Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette for the Luxembourgish part, and also hourly to Arlon, Libramont and Virton on the Belgian routes. This railway route hosts cargo trains as well as passenger trains and has been operating for a number of years. The city is situated just 10 kilometres south of European highway E 411/E42 between Luxembourg and Brussels.  Culture   Museums  Athus has two museums: * Athus et l'acier (Athus and Steel), which is about the history of the steelworks and the factory of the city. * L'Univers des pompiers (fr) (The Fireman's World), which is about firemen.  Religion  Athus is Catholic, though today there is a very limited number of people who go to church. The church is dedicated to Saint Stephen and was built in 1833.

Biography He was born in Hausen, near Arnstadt; from 1706 he studied with Johann Sebastian Bach, who was organist there between 1703 and 1707. He also taught, in Rudolstadt, by P. H. Erlebach and Nicolaus Vetter. He moved to Weimar to study further with Bach from 1710 to 1715, during which time he copied Jacques Boyvin's two livres d'orgue. He was appointed organist at Stadtilm in 1715, leaving in May 1721 to take up Bach's former post of organist to the Weimar court. He failed in two applications in 1729 for organ posts at the Nikolaikirche, Leipzig, and Sts Peter und Paul, G√∂rlitz, which were filled by Bach pupils Johann Schneider and David Nicolai. The Leipzig judges remarked that he 'played too fast and confused the congregation'; this did not deter him from boasting of his 'swiftness of hand and feet' in the second application. He was selected for the post of organist of the Marktkirche in Hanover in 1735, but forbidden from leaving Weimar by Duke Ernst August, the same prohibition that Duke Wilhelm Ernst had imposed years before on Bach. Nevertheless, he became deputy mayor of Weimar as some consolation, and mayor two years later; he remained there for the rest of his life. Works He composed a St Mark Passion which is now lost, and only three of his works, all organ chorales, are now known. His setting of Jesu Leiden, Pein und Tod, BWV Anh. 57 (modelled on O Mensch, bewein dein S√ºnde gro√ü, BWV 622, in Bach's Orgelb√ºchlein) is one of the most elaborately decorated chorales in the whole repertoire, with the chorale melody embellished by hemidemisemiquavers and even shorter notes. He published the two other chorales as Vermischte musikalische Choral-Gedanken (Weimar, 1737; in Incognita organo XXXVI, Hilversum, 1988); they are of a similar style to Bach's 'Arnstadt' chorales with expressive, improvisational interludes to a full harmonised chorale; there are other features resembling Bach's 'Leipzig' chorales, BWV 651‚Äì668. There are some copies of Bach's compositions in Vogler's hand; he was formerly known in the Bach literature as 'Anonymous 18' before his identity was established. The copy he made of the Prelude and Fughetta in C major, BWV 870a, is valued in performance practice studies, for its written-out fingerings.

In the Maine House: Opposition to the Barwise Bill and the Ku Klux Klan Hale served in the Maine House of Representatives 1923-1930, and was elected as Speaker in 1929-1930. In 1923 and 1925 he was instrumental in defeating the Barwise Bill, a measure supported by the majority of his party, which would have changed the Maine Constitution to outlaw all state aid to parochial schools. The bill (introduced and defeated twice) was strongly opposed by Maine's Catholic population, and just as strongly favored by the Ku Klux Klan whose state headquarters and center of support was in Hale's home city of Portland. The measure split the Maine Republican Party and embroiled state politics for three years. It was favored by Governor Owen Brewster but opposed by a faction that included Hale and his cousin, U.S. Senator Frederick Hale, whose Senate seat Brewster would eventually (but unsuccessfully) contest.Lewiston Daily Sun, Mar. 22, 1923; \\"Barwise Bill Defeated in House\\" Lewiston Evening Journal, Mar. 24, 1925, p. 4 In leading the 1923 debate against the Barwise Bill, Hale said it was \\"conceived in intolerance against the Roman Catholic Church\\" and related that he \\"knew of a person (n Europe). . . who was killed for the only reason that he was a Jew\\". He then read extracts from speeches by the King Kleagle of the Maine Ku Klux Klan, F. Eugene Farnsworth, calling him \\"an ignorant demagogue\\".Lewiston Daily Sun, Mar. 22, 1923 In his 1925 speech against a new version of the same bill, Hale cited examples of recent intolerance in American political life, including the rejection of German language teaching during World War I and Tennessee's law against the teaching of evolution. Referring again to the Ku Klux Klan of Maine, who had demonstrated their strength during a recent Maine State Senate debate on the same bill, Hale said that only the defeat of the Barwise measure would \\"appease this hysteria\\".\\"Barwise Bill Defeated in House\\" Lewiston Evening Journal, Mar. 24, 1925, p. 4 Hale was a convincing champion of the Anti- Barwise forces because he was a Protestant Republican from Portland, a Klan hotbed. The bill was defeated, but Hale's opposition to it likely defeated his own initial bid to become Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives in 1926. Hale made a second successful bid for the House Speakership in 1929, by which time the Klan was a spent force in the Maine Republican Party. U.S. Congress: The New Deal and Cold War Years Hale was elected as a Republican to the Seventy-eighth and seven succeeding U.S. Congresses (January 3, 1943 ‚Äì January 3, 1959). In the war-time election of 1942, Hale used his support for Roosevelt's foreign policy to unseat Congressman James C. Oliver, who was a pre-war isolationist, in the Republican primary. In the general election, however, Hale was called a \\"disciple of hate\\" by his opponent, former Democratic Governor of Maine Louis J. Brann, because of an article he'd written for Harper's Magazine in 1936 entitled \\"I Too Hate Roosevelt\\" and criticizing the New Deal.Lawrence Journal-World, Sep 15, 1942, p. 2 Brann went so far as to claim that a Hale victory would \\"please Hitler\\".The Lewiston Daily Sun, Sep 12, 1942, p. 1 Hale started his own congressional service with equally alarmist rhetoric, telling an audience in Oct. 1942 that they could expect Roosevelt to \\"abolish Congress\\" within the next four years.The Lewiston Daily Sun, Oct 23, 1942, p. 1 During the early Cold War Hale supported the formation and role of the United Nations but was otherwise on the right wing of the Republican Party during the Truman administration. In 1950 he said of Sen. Joseph McCarthy that \\"people should give him credit for what he is trying to do instead of carping on his methods\\", a position opposite to that of his Maine Republican colleague Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, and early critic of McCarthyism.Lewiston Daily Sun, April 8, 1950, p. 1 He also defended Gen. Douglas MacArthur when he was fired by Truman, claiming MacArthur \\"has always been right\\" about the \\"Far Eastern situation\\",Times News, April 14, 1951, p. 2 and introduced a resolution to impeach Truman after the president nationalized steel mills in 1952.Portsmouth Times, April 22, 1952, p. 2 On the other hand, he advised against the use of atomic bombs in the Korean War while his more liberal colleague Sen. Smith joined right-wing Maine Sen. Owen Brewster in sanctioning their use against Communist China \\"if necessary\\".Lewiston Evening Journal, Nov. 29, 1950, p. 1 Hale voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Hale's last election victory, in 1956, saw him winning by only 29 votes out of over 100,000 cast.Herald Journal, Oct 13, 1936, p. 1 His Democratic Party opponent was James C. Oliver, who, as a Republican, Hale had unseated for the same congressional seat in 1942. Oliver ran against Hale again in 1958 and this time won back the seat he'd occupied 26 years before. Hale afterwards resumed the practice of law in Washington, D.C.. He died on November 30, 1976 in Washington, D.C., and was interred in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland, Maine.

They are often worn by construction workers and carpenters, hence the name, to carry their tools so that their hands can be kept free yet the tools are still easily accessible.  Characteristics  Carpenter jeans are usually made of blue denim. Canvas may be the material in more durable styles, and colours may vary; white and beige are other popular colours. A 'hammer loop' is usually located on the left leg; although this was originally designed to be useful, most carpenters do not use the loop, because the hammer often falls out or bangs around the leg. Other features include extra pockets, sometimes located on the outer thighs, and extra rivets for durability. Another feature is wider belt loops, to accommodate a wider, thicker belt. Because of the weight of the tools carried in the pockets and loops, a tightly cinched, wide 'work belt' must be worn by most people. Most carpenter jeans are made for function, not fashion, and are usually of a softer denim than the original utilitarian jeans, with a looser fit. Carpenter jeans were quite popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s hip hop scene especially those by the Tommy Hilfiger brand who placed their trademark logo on the hammer loop.

The AP logo is well visible on a rudder A sportsplane PZL.26, during the Challenge 1934 contest, of the Aero Club of the Polish Republic (ARP) History Aviation organizations could be founded in Poland only after regaining independence in 1918. The first such organization was Aeroklub Polski w Poznaniu (PAC in Pozna≈Ñ), founded on 30 October 1919 and admitted to the FAI in 1920. In June 1920 there was founded Aeroklub Polski w Warszawie (PAC in Warsaw). On 18 January 1921 both Aero Clubs formed a central federation Aeroklub Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej (ARP; Aero Club of the Polish Republic). By 1939, there were created several other regional aero clubs, including some university aero clubs. Before the World War II, members of the ARP took active part in world's aviation sports. The first major international event was the Challenge 1930 touring planes contest. The Poles enjoyed success in the Challenge 1932 and several Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning contests. The ARP organized the Challenge 1934 international contest and the Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning in 1934-1936, also successful for the Polish pilots. Just after the World War II, in 1945 the association was renewed and more regional aero clubs were created. In 1957‚Äì1990 it was named Aeroklub Polskiej Rzeczpospolitej Ludowej (APRL; Aero Club of the Polish People's Republic). At the time of communist Poland, the membership in aero club was practically the only chance for private persons to fly. The ARP/APRL was supported by the government and supplied with trainer and auxiliary aircraft withdrawn from the Polish Air Force, distributed to regional aero clubs. Present In 1990, after a fall of communism, the organization was renamed to its current name Aeroklub Polski, referring to the first historical organization of that type. Aeroklub Polski is the national governing and coordinating body of air sport and recreational flying. Organizational units of the Aeroklub Polski are regional aero clubs; members of regional aero clubs are also members of AP. Currently there are 58 regional aero clubs in Poland (as of 2007). Goals of AP are, among others: a propagation and development of the aviation in Poland, an organization of air sports and air recreation, a representation of Polish air sports abroad, a training of aviators. It is also a sports association.

Located at the end of Ballpark Road in Deltaville, Virginia, it hosts baseball games from several different teams and organizations. History Early 1950s aerial photograph of Deltaville BallparkThe ballpark was originally constructed in 1948, and hosted its first game in June of that year. In 1976, the first major renovation occurred, when much of the grandstand was rebuilt due to concerns of structural stability. A second renovation occurred in 1996, which saw the construction of new dugouts and replacement of the outfield fence. In 2016, a multi-year renovation began to help preserve and appropriately renovate the ballpark. Over the winter of 2016-17, the 68-year-old roof was replaced. Contractors used custom-cut rough- sawn lumber to emulate the original wood, and metal roofing very similar to the original was installed. The scoreboard was also replaced, and a light pole which had a large woodpecker hole in it was replaced as well. In 2020, phase 2 was completed, which primarily involved rebuilding a new, modern concession building, which made way for an ADA-accessible entrance ramp into the grandstand, and refitting a partial row of seats to accept wheelchairs. The outdoor concourse area was also enlarged. Future plans, namely phase 3, involve constructing new ADA-accessible bathrooms to complete the accessibility renovation, and future plans include replacing the lighting system and re-grading the field. Field and stadium The wooden grandstands provide covered seating for approximately 300 fans. They are protected from foul balls by a crab pot wire fence.Daily Press. In Deltaville, Baseball and Boating Rule the Day - \\"In Deltaville, Baseball and Boating Rule the Day\\" A small press box sits in the top two rows behind home plate; it has telephone connections to each dugout, scoreboard controls, microphone, and a PA/Music system. Beside the home team dugout (3rd base line) is a small additional seating area with room for approximately 15-20 spectators. The infield playing surface is skin, which drains remarkably well for a field of its type. Hundreds of holes are drilled beneath its surface, filled with rock to facilitate drainage. Outfield wall dimensions are 300-365-295, with the metal wall being approximately 9 feet tall. Even with the high wall, the short distance down the lines leads a large number of home runs. One of the light poles is home to an Osprey nest, whose occupants occasionally will leave remains of fish to be found by an unsuspecting player.

The season typically begins around the second week of May, and continues through early August. Players are mostly college-aged players from the local area, with a number of former college & professional players also among the roster. Many players come from teams at Christopher Newport University, Lynchburg College, Randolph-Macon College, Norfolk State University, The Apprentice School, Old Dominion University, and several others. Two Major League Baseball World Series champions have pitched for the Deltas. Former Minnesota Twins pitcher Keith Atherton, a native of nearby Mathews County, as well as former New York Yankee Jim Coates of Lancaster County, pitched several post-MLB years for the Deltas. Both were members of MLB clubs that won the World Series. Admission to Deltas games is $6 for adults, $3 for teens, and kids 12 & under free. Middlesex Little League Before the construction of the Middlesex Sports Complex, Deltaville Ballpark was one of the primary sites for playing baseball for Middlesex County youth. Since the construction of the complex, all 12-and-under games are played on the smaller 60-foot diamonds at the complex, as well as most of the 13- to 18-year-old games on the complex's 90' diamonds. However, on certain occasions, sometimes due to scheduling conflicts or just for the heck of it, games for the older group would be played at the ballpark, often with all the music, announcers, and other light fanfare that goes along with a typical game; however, this ceased after 2003. In 2016, Deltaville Ballpark began an annual tradition of giving children an opportunity to play at the stadium again. \\"Little League Weekend at Deltaville Ballpark\\" schedules youth teams from 7-8 year old machine pitch through 15-16 year old Senior League a weekend of games at the stadium. As with all Little League games, admission to the event is free. 241 Baseball in 2020, a new youth league called 241 baseball was launched, and replaced American Legion baseball in the area. Seven teams share the ballpark and the Lancaster Dream Fields complex as home sites, for high school aged players 13-17. Former Middlesex High School Chargers The local public high school, Middlesex High School, used the ballpark as its home game & practice field for the varsity baseball team between 1996 and 2014. Games began in early March, running through mid-May or later. The high school hosted the Rappahannock General Hospital Invitational Tournament each spring, a warmup tournament for Middlesex and three invited opponents. The ballpark also hosted the Tidewater District tournament, and has played host to Middlesex home games of the Region A tournament, and in 2002, State Group A Quarterfinals. In 2015, the Syd Thrift Athletic Complex was opened on the campus of the high school, and the baseball teams moved to the new field at the complex. In 2019, Middlesex High School returned to the ballpark for a one-game stint, with intentions on the game becoming an annual special event. 2020's follow up, along with 2 other scheduled high school games with other area high school teams, were cancelled due to COVID-19. Middle Peninsula Mariners The Middle Peninsula Mariners team was formed in the 1990s as a second semi-pro team to call Deltaville home. Like the Deltas, played with wood bats & a schedule which ran from May through early August. Players were mostly college-aged or former college players, with many on the roster coming from area Division III college baseball teams. The Mariners played in the Virginia Baseball League until 2009, and won the 2008 & 2009 league titles.Middle Peninsula Mariners \\"Mariners Web Site\\" The Mariners are no longer active as of the 2011 season. They last played an abbreviated schedule as an independent team in 2010. For many years from the 1990s until 2010, the \\"cross-town\\" Deltas & Mariners played each other at the ballpark. Sometimes dubbed \\"The Battle for the Ballpark\\", this event always drew large crowds, and generally, a good baseball game. Area players were in both lineups, and many fans of both teams know a number of players from either side. The teams each played one home game, the opponent having to be \\"visitor\\" at their own field once a year. Other uses The ballpark has been used for several other events in the past. These include recreational softball, pickup baseball games, charitable events (memorable charity events include a womanless wedding show, an outdoor concerts, and donkey baseball games), as well as other events suited to the ballpark. Heritage Day Fireworks at the Ballpark on Heritage Day For decades, on or about the 4th of July, a Saturday event known as Heritage Day occurred in Deltaville. The day was filled with arts & crafts, crab races, and even a parade, and was capped off each year by a Deltas game at the ballpark. Traditionally the opponent was the longtime Deltas rival Tappahannock Tides, however, from 2007-2013 the opponent was another team from the Deltas league. The game time was moved up from the traditional 7:30pm start time to 5:00pm, and was followed by a short \\"Old- Timers Game\\", in which former Deltaville players of all ages relived their playing days for a couple of innings. This was all followed at approximately 8:45pm, with a large fireworks display to celebrate Independence Day.Deltaville Community Association. \\"DeltavilleVA.com\\" The grandstands are typically filled to capacity for this game, and fans will venture into the infield once the lights go out to watch the fireworks unobstructed. More than a thousand more will bring blankets & lawn chairs to enjoy the fireworks from the large field beside the ballpark. The Deltaville Community Association abandoned Heritage Day in 2014, in favor of a new event, the Deltaville Seafood Festival, which is held on another weekend, typically in May. Fireworks have not been fired at the ballpark since 2012, though there have been attempts to revive the town's Independence Day celebration.

Myer (T-ARC-6) was the second of only two Maritime Commission type S3-S2-BP1 ships built for the US Army near the end of World War II intended to support Army Signal Corps communications cables. She is named for Brig. Gen. Albert J. Myer, the founder of the Signal Corps. The other ship was the William H. G. Bullard, later USS Neptune, which Myer later joined in naval service. The new ship was laid up in 1946 until reactivated by the Army in 1952 for service out of Seattle, Washington maintaining the Alaska Communications System that served civilian as well as military needs. USACS Albert J. Myer also saw service on other defense and civilian cables and supported the Navy's Project Caesar, the unclassified name for building and maintaining the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) that tracked Soviet submarines. The ship was transferred on 13 June 1966 to the Navy for service as USNS Albert J. Myer (T-ARC-6) assigned to Project Caesar, though supporting other military systems on occasion. Albert J. Myer, along with sister ship Neptune, were the only ships in the Navy designed and built as cable ships. Unlike Neptune, which had been commissioned by the Navy, Albert J. Myer was never commissioned serving entirely as a civil service crewed ship under the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS)/Military Sealift Command (MSC).USACS William H. G. Bullard had also been laid up shortly after launch but was not activated by the Army. The Navy designated that ship for Project Caesar support in 1952 and withdrew the ship from reserve 17 February 1953. The Navy intended the ship for commissioned service renaming it Neptune designated ARC-2. was the first designated Navy cable repair ship. Both underwent modifications and a major rebuild in the early 1980s. Albert J. Myer was deactivated in 1994.  Construction  Maritime Commission hull 2558 was laid down on 14 April 1945 by Pusey & Jones Corp. of Wilmington, Delaware as the yard's hull number 1109.Shipbuilding History has the erroneous spelling \\"Meyer\\" found in a few references. Albert J. Myer was launched on 7 November 1945, and sponsored by Mrs. Grace Salisbury Ingles, the wife of Major General Harry C. Ingles, commanding officer of the Army Signal Corps.  Function  The ship's assignments were typically to transport, deploy, retrieve and repair submarine cables. In later Naval service functions specified were towing a cable plow, a large devices used to bury cable in coastal areas to protect it from damage from trawls and other hazards. Additional functions not directly related to cable work were towing acoustic projectors and conducting acoustic, hydrographic, and bathymetric surveys.  Career  U.S. Army Since World War II ended some eight months before her completion, the Albert J. Myer was delivered to the Maritime Commission on 17 May 1946 and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, Lee Hall, Virginia. The ship was again taken in by the US Army on 7 February 1952. The ship was reactivated at Baltimore, Maryland with a crew recruited from Seattle, Washington where the ship would be based and put into service as USACS Albert J. Myer operated by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Army Cable Ship Albert J. Myer 1952 ‚Äî 1966. Albert J. Myer's primary mission at the time was maintenance of the Alaska Communications System which handled both military and commercial traffic to Alaska. Two cables linking Port Angeles, Washington and Ketchikan, Alaska with forty-eight circuits were laid in 1956. The ship also worked on projects for the Air Force and the Navy, including substantial assignment to Project Caesar in support of the Sound Surveillance System. During 1957 the ship laid cable for the U.S. Air Force between Thule, Greenland and Baffin Island with a landing at Cape Dyer. The Cape Dyer landing, subject to damage by gounding icebergs, was bypassed by the ship in 1964. In 1961 the ship laid communications cable connecting the Pacific islands of Kwajalein, Ennylabegan (one of the islands in the Kwajalein atoll), Gugeegue, Eniwetok and Roi-Namur supporting the Army's then Kwajalein Missile Range, now the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site for Nike Zeus tests. The first phase was laying thirty miles Submarine cable is usually measured in nautical miles, but the source does not specify and is for public consumption. of entrenched cable connecting the islands in the Kwajalein group and then another fifty-five miles of coaxial ocean cable connecting Eniwetok and Roi-Namur to the Kwajalein network. The entrenched cable path had to be first cleared of World War II era ordinance and the trench prepared by Navy underwater demolition team. To preserve communications the ship was also available for emergency repairs to commercial cables. For example, the cable ship repaired a break in the Cable and Wireless cable between Fanning Island and Bamfield, Vancouver Island, British Columbia that was a British around the world link. The only other cable ship available in the northwest Pacific was also an Army ship. Albert J. Myer laid the shore ends of the Hampden, Newfoundland terminus of CANTAT-1 (CANadian TransAtlantic Telephone cable). During March and April 1964 the ship conducted an extensive, detailed magnetic survey for the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office northeast of Hispanola. U.S. Navy The cable layer was returned to the Maritime Administration (MARAD), 13 June 1966, and simultaneously transferred to the Navy where she served as the cable repair ship operated by the Military Sea Transportation Service as USNS Albert J. Myer (T-ARC-6) permanently assigned to Project Caesar. USNS Albert J. Myer (T-ARC-6) circa May 1976 before modernization. Only two of the four cable ships available for Project Caesar had been designed and built as cable ships, the others being conversions and lacking some critical features needed for cable operations. The larger and were not suitable for modernization while Albert J. Myer and Neptune had cable ship features, including deeper draft than the larger ships, that made them suitable candidates for modernization. Albert J. Myer and Neptune were extensively modernized in 1980 by Bethlehem Steel in Baltimore, Maryland. This included new turbo-electric engines replacing two Skinner Uniflow Reciprocating Steam Engines and modern cable machinery. The two ships had been the last ships in the Navy to operate using reciprocating steam engines. The ship performed cable repair duties all over the world until 1994, when she'd been in active service for nearly 42 years. During her career, she received a Meritorious Unit Commendation (1974), and four Navy E ribbons (1981, 1982, 1984, and 1985). Albert J. Myer was deactivated in 1994 entering the James River Reserve Fleet at Lee Hall, Virginia on 31 March 1994. On 1 April 1998 the Navy transferred title to the Maritime Administration for disposal. The ship was dismantled and recycled by International Shipbreaking Ltd of Brownsville, TX in 2005.

A graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he commanded the USS South Carolina during World War I, for which he received the Navy Cross. During his two terms as governor, he proved one of the most contentious leaders in Guam's history. He exercised a large amount of control over islanders' daily lives, including banning whistling and smoking and setting up a curfew. He came into conflict with prominent Americans and Washington Naval leaders when he outlawed marriage between whites and non-whites on the island, believing the Chamorro people inferior. Eventually, concerned islanders gained the attention of Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, who had Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt personally order the rescinding of the act. Gilmer was removed for a short time before serving a second term. During his second term, he continued making numerous edicts, eventually equaling 50 separate orders. He required all men over sixteen to carry identification cards, partially in an effort to wipe out the Spanish naming customs of adopting both the mother's and father's name. Seen as autocratic and abusive of his power, the Navy ultimately removed him from the post in 1920. A number of geographical features in Alaska, as well as a school in North Carolina, are named after him, largely during an expedition that he took part in to explore parts of the Alaskan islands. Life and naval career Gilmer graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1885. As an ensign, he served aboard . In 1906, he married Florence Peterson. On 2 January 1914 he received command of .NavSource Online: Cruiser Photo Archive During World War I, he commanded the battleship , for which he received the Navy Cross. He retired with the rank of Captain after resigning his commission. Gilmer died on January 8, 1955. Governorship Gilmer served two terms as Naval Governor of Guam. His first term lasted from November 15, 1918 to November 22, 1919. A month before he arrived, Guam experienced an outbreak of influenza, and though he set up quarantine zones upon taking command, the pandemic lasted through December, with nearly a thousand dead. Gilmer's administration proved very controversial as he exercised a large amount of control over the activities of the island's inhabitants. He outlawed alcohol, smoking, and whistling. Further, he forbid any parties that lasted after 10 p.m. In an effort to curtail the growing rat problem, Gilmer forced all residents to either deliver the heads of five rats or a tax of twenty-five cents to the government every month. Gilmer came into conflict with prominent American families on the island and stateside naval officials. He issued an order that forbade any white American from marrying a Chamorro or Filipino spouse, arguing such marriages created a new class that \\"wields a powerful influence\\" and caused servicemen to leave the navy and fall under the influence of native religions. A committee of forty-two prominent Guamanians signed a petition against the order, and the Legislature of Guam formally objected to the order. Gilmer attempted to justify his order to the committee in 1919 by claiming that \\"if a man in the United States marries a woman of any other color, he sinks immediately to the level of his wife.\\" James H. Underwood, postmaster of the island, wrote directly to officials in Washington, D.C. to protest the move, as many Americans had already married Chamorros. He eventually obtained a meeting with the Chief of Naval Operations, former Guam governor Robert Coontz, and soon after Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, personally wrote to Gilmer and ordered the law revoked, allowing whites to again marry Chamorros and Filipinos. He was relieved of duty soon after the incident. Gilmer returned for a second from December 21, 1919 to July 7, 1920. In March 1920, Gilmer began requiring that all men sixteen and older obtain a c√®dula personal, essentially an identification document issued by the government. These documents were used to interact with the government during matters like tax payment, land transfers, birth certification, and anything in the court system. At the same time, these documents were meant to discourage the Guamanian practice of using Spanish naming customs, in which a person used the father's last name, followed by the mother's maiden name, and forced the western custom of using the father's name as the last name upon the people. Throughout his two terms, he issued over 50 orders, many of them later viewed as autocratic, and increased the use of the death penalty exponentially, which had only been used once before during America's occupation of the island before him. Eventually, Gilmer was removed from office after many of his orders were seen as abuses of power and embarrassing to the Navy. After his removal from his post, Gilmer resigned his Navy commission. Legacy In Fletcher, North Carolina, a parochial elementary school administered by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Captain Gilmer School is named after him. The school's name was changed to \\"Captain Gilmer School\\" in 1950 after Gilmer gave $2000 for the construction of an additional classroom and two bathrooms. Gilmer Bay on the western shore of Kruzof Island was named after him in 1897, while he was a lieutenant. As an ensign, he served in an exploration party, during which Gilmore Cove on Partofshikof Island was named after him.

Early life Austen was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, as Ian Hamilton. She grew up in Stonehaven, south of Aberdeen, in the North East of Scotland. Educated at Robert Gordon's College, Aberdeen, she had a generally unhappy and dislocated childhood, including a spell at boarding school, where she was abused. She was an outwardly popular and charismatic child but after suffering years of sexual abuse made worse by her gender dysphoria, she decided to join the British Army to camouflage her real personality. Austen joined as an officer in the Royal Irish Rangers in 1982, serving in Northern Ireland. She retrained as a video journalist in 1986 working for Scottish Television. Her military background saw her dispatched to war zones covering the Gulf War 1, the civil wars in Angola and Afghanistan, and the conflict in Bosnia, as well as service with the United Nations. She then worked as a director and series producer for Scottish and Anglia Television. In 1997 Hamilton was promoted to editor-in- chief of the television division of Mirror Group. After management changes at Mirror Group, she took up a senior management position at Granada TV. She has been nominated three times by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Rejoining the British Army During 1995, Austen rejoined the Army. As an over-age candidate, she first joined the Territorial Army and then the Regular Army. She joined the Parachute Regiment in 2002, having already passed the stringent selection process at age 35, and went on to attend All Arms Commando Course and Special Forces selection with 22 SAS, becoming a combat survival and a physical training instructor. She served with the Cheshire Regiment and The Highlanders in a variety of command appointments, as well as a number of staff appointments both in the UK and overseas, with a speciality in Information and Psychological Operations. In 2003 she commanded a company from The Parachute Regiment on operations in Iraq. She deployed on operations in Bosnia, Northern Ireland, the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. She returned to the United Kingdom in 2006 and spent a period recovering from two continuous years of operations before taking a position back in Afghanistan with NATO Forces, advising on specialist counter-narcotics operations, from where she was medevacked back to the UK with a serious infection following an IED incident. Forced resignation, 2007 In 2007, Abigail decided to undergo gender normalisation, in accordance with her desire to live as a female. Transgender individuals in the UK are protected under a number of legislative acts, including the Sex Discrimination Act Amendments (1999) and the Gender Recognition Act (2004), which make it illegal to treat a person differently on the grounds of gender alone, with the aim of protecting the rights of trans- people in the work-place. Although other people in the Royal Navy and Air Force have successfully transitioned in the service, as the first officer and first paratrooper, Austen's background caused considerable surprise to the Army, particularly in the light of constant media attention. At that time, the British military did not have regulations in place to support Austen's continued service with Airborne Forces. This led to a lengthy and public legal dispute. The issue was eventually amicably resolved, and Austen resigned her commission. Austen's case led to Army policy on transgender soldiers being formalised for the first time which now allows soldiers to transition while in service. The Regimental Colonel of The Parachute Regiment wrote to Austen to thank her for her \\"years of loyal service as an Airborne Officer\\". Present day Austen was the subject of a documentary on Channel 4 (UK) in March 2008 entitled Sex Change Soldier.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ449clo2jw This was repeated several times on UK television and sold to a number of other territories. The film continues to be shown around the world and formed the basis for a biographical film based on her life, produced by the Japanese TV company NHK. She continues to undertake a number of training and advisory roles on gender issues, including with Lancashire Police. She continues to support the Parachute Regiment by fundraising for Airborne Charities.

The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Highmark Healthy High 5 grant Northern Cambria High School also received a $7,588 Healthy High 5 grant in 2011. The funds were used to fund its Get Moving Keep Moving program.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Project 720 Northern Cambria School District did not participate in Project 720 High School Reform grants. Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth‚Äôs high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High schools applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. The funding was discontinued effective with 2011-12 Pennsylvania education budget. Nutrition/Wellness policy Northern Cambria School Board established a district-wide wellness policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Northern Cambria High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 The district also offered the Seamless Summer Food program to all children without charge in the summer of 2015. In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non-subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Northern Cambria High School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Extracurriculars The district offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the school district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 Athletics The Northern Cambria teams are call the Colts with the school colors being black and gold.

He was one of the last students of Johann Sebastian Bach. His students included Michael Gotthard Fischer, Karl Gottlieb Umbreit, Johann Wilhelm H√§ssler and Christian Heinrich Rinck. Biography Kittel was born and died in Erfurt. He first studied with Jakob Adlung. He moved to Leipzig in 1748 and was a favourite - and last - pupil of Johann Sebastian Bach until his death two years later. He was appointed organist and teacher in Langensalza in 1751, following which he returned to Erfurt as organist of the Barf√º√üerkirche, in 1756, moving to the Predigerkirche in 1762. He refused many generous and more munificent offers, including one in 1790 from Duchess Anna Amalia of Saxe-Weimar to travel to Italy, remaining in Erfurt for the rest of his life. He played many evening recitals there and was famous as a virtuoso organist; Goethe, Herder, and Wieland all went to hear him play, and he made a concert tour to Hamburg in 1800, remaining there for a year while preparing a book of chorales for Schleswig-Holstein. Compositions He considered himself to be \\"grounded in the principles of Bach\\" and aimed \\"to awaken, maintain and heighten feelings of devotion in the hearts of his hearers by means of music\\". His teaching and composition fulfilled this aim by a restriction to simple forms which were best suited to liturgical use. He wrote some large-scale organ works such as double chorale variations based on Bach's examples, though he was influenced by the contemporary galant style, with a strong emphasis on melody. His piano sonatas of 1789 have features in common with the Viennese classical school. Piano *6 Sonaten ... nebst einer Fantasie (Gera, 1789) *6 Ver√§nderungen, √ºber ...

Notice how a long exposure blurs passerby while buildings retain sharp focus In this 45-minute exposure taken on a dark clear night at Paranal Observatory, the stars leave trails as they appear to revolve around the south celestial pole (left), due to Earth's rotation. Long-exposure photography is used at night to take interesting pictures of the roads with their route being noticeable Long-exposure, time-exposure, or slow-shutter photography involves using a long-duration shutter speed to sharply capture the stationary elements of images while blurring, smearing, or obscuring the moving elements. Long- exposure photography captures one element that conventional photography does not: an extended period of time. The paths of bright moving objects become clearly visible‚Äîclouds form broad bands, vehicle lights draw bright streaks, stars leave trails in the sky, and water waves appear smooth. Only bright objects leave visible trails, whereas dark objects usually disappear. Boats in long exposures disappear during the daytime, but draw bright trails from their lights at night.

The 'BULB' mode on a DSLR camera was used for this photo. Note the \\"flashing\\" of the locomotive ditch lights. Whereas there is no fixed definition of what constitutes \\"long\\", the intent is to create a photo that somehow shows the effect of passing time, be it smoother waters or light trails. A 30-minute photo of a static object and surrounding cannot be distinguished from a short exposure, hence, the inclusion of motion is the main factor to add intrigue to long exposure photos. Images with exposure times of several minutes also tend to make moving people or dark objects disappear (because they are in any one spot for only a fraction of the exposure time), often adding a serene and otherworldly appearance to long exposure photos. When a scene includes both stationary and moving subjects (for example, a fixed street and moving cars or a camera within a car showing a fixed dashboard and moving scenery), a slow shutter speed can cause interesting effects, such as light trails. Long exposures are easiest to accomplish in low-light conditions but can be done in brighter light using neutral density filters or specially designed cameras. When using a dense neutral density filter your camera's auto focus will not be able to function. It is best to compose and focus without the filter. Then once you are happy with the composition, switch to manual focus and put the neutral density filter back on. 8 Tips for long exposure photography.

A 30-second exposure shows the candlelight trails in a Romanian cathedral. Long-exposure photography is often used in a night- time setting, where the lack of light forces longer exposures, if maximum quality is to be retained. Increasing ISO sensitivity allows for shorter exposures, but substantially decreases image quality through reduced dynamic range and higher noise. By leaving the camera's shutter open for an extended period of time, more light is absorbed, creating an exposure that captures the entire dynamic range of the digital camera sensor or film. If the camera is stationary for the entire period of time that the shutter is open, a very vibrant and clear photograph can be produced.School of Photography Light painting Example of light painting In this technique, a scene is kept very dark and the photographer or an assistant takes a light source‚Äîit can be small penlight‚Äîand moves it about in patterns. The light source can be turned off between strokes. Often, stationary objects in the scene are illuminated by briefly turning on studio lights, by one or more flashes from a strobe light, or by increasing the aperture.Greenspun, Philip (January 2007). \\"Studio Photography \\".

Debris in the swirling water in the pool forms complete circles. A 4-second-long exposure of a gorge yields a more misty look. Long exposures can blur moving water so it has mist-like qualities while keeping stationary objects like land and structures sharp.Digital Photography Review Varying the shutter speed can produce different effects, preserving some of the water's turbulence or smoothing it out entirely.photopigs Solargraphy A one-year exposure, showing sun trails for the entire year 2014. Image was taken in Sashegy, Buda, Budapest, Hungary. A Solargraph taken from ESO's APEX at Chajnantor. Solargraphy is a technique in which a fixed pinhole camera is used to expose photographic paper for a length of time that is typically 6-months but can be as short as a few hours and last well over a year. Depending on the length of the exposure the resulting image shows the path of the Sun across the sky both from dawn until dusk, but also from North to South (or vice versa) between the solstices. Each light streak in a solargraphic image represents one day. Where light streaks are broken or missing indicates obstruction of the sun, which is caused by cloud cover. Frequently, cameras are made from upcycled aluminum or tin cans which can be made light-tight and are generally weatherproof for the time needed to make the exposure. Apertures usually range in fractions of a millimeter One example of this is a single six-month exposure taken by photographer Justin Quinnell, showing sun-trails over Clifton Suspension Bridge between 19 December 2007 and 21 June 2008. Part of the Slow light: 6 months over Bristol exhibition, Quinnell describes the piece as capturing \\"a period of time beyond what we can perceive with our own vision.\\" This method of solargraphy uses a simple pinhole camera securely fixed in a position which won't be disturbed. Quinnel constructed his camera from an empty drink can with a 0.25mm aperture and a single sheet of photographic paper. On 3 February 2015, a pinhole camera used in a Georgia State University solargraphy art project was blown up by the Atlanta bomb squad, due to reports of it being a bomb. The device, one of nineteen placed throughout the city, had been duct-taped to the 14th Ave. bridge above I-75/85; traffic was shut down for two hours, and the remaining cameras were later removed by authorities.MICHAEL ZHANG: It Looks Like Someone‚Äôs Solargraphy Camera Just Got Blown Up by an Atlanta Bomb Squad 2 FEB 2015Alexis Stevens.

Combining these traditions in innovative ways, they produce sounds that are both new and distinctive. Their focus on the local is complemented by the creative use of related traditions in Scotland, Ireland and the Scots-Irish diaspora in North America.

Originally located off Drum Point at the mouth of the Patuxent River, it is now an exhibit at the Calvert Marine Museum. History The earliest recorded call for a light at Drum Point came in report by one Lt. William D. Porter to the Secretary of the Treasury. In the 1850s funds were appropriated and some initial surveys made; disputes between the state of Maryland and the federal government over the property to be used eventually brought these efforts to naught. If this project had been carried through, it would have been an early example of a screw-pile lighthouse in the bay, as the Pungoteague Creek Light had been finished only two years earlier. In spite of subsequent requests by steamship operators, it was not until 1882 that a $25,000 appropriation was made, and in the following year a offshore lot was obtained. The original appropriation was to construct a pair of range lights, for reasons that remain obscure. The funds were not adequate for such a project and it was never seriously considered for execution. Instead, a screw- pile light was prefabricated in parts at Lazaretto Point, and the light was erected in about a month, being lit for the first time in August of that year. The light was needed in the first place because of the considerable shoaling around the point. This gradually shifted the shoreline to the point where the light, which originally stood in ten feet of water, was entirely on land in 1970. At the turn of the century a small bridge was constructed from the light to the shore (as visible in the photograph), allowing the keeper's family to live with him in the light. Unlike many such lights, Drum Point escaped ice damage. The storm of 1933 flooded the house and sank the tender, however. Originally a fixed red light was shown, with dark sectors added starting in 1889. This was changed in 1911 to a fixed white light with red sectors. The light was converted to electricity in 1944 and automated in 1960. The light was discontinued two years later, replaced at first by a lighted buoy, and then a fixed offshore light. Unlike other such conversions, however, the house was not torn down, but simply abandoned. The Calvert County Historical Society attempted to acquire the light as early as 1966, but they did not gain possession until 1974, and the federal government retained the land on which it sat. However, due to a grant and the timely assistance of the B.F. Diamond Construction Company (which was constructing a bridge over the Patuxent nearby) the light was cut from the ground and barged to its current location. Restoration was aided by many grants and the donation of much period furnishings, and the light was rededicated as an exhibit in June 1978. Fortuitously, the complete logbooks from 1883 to 1943 survive as well, providing an excellent glimpse into the life of a lighthouse keeper.

He played as a defensive back for eight seasons in the NFL.http://www.albanyherald.com/former-albany-businessman-brady-keys-jr-dies- at-age/article_cb4599dc-57e1-57c5-890b-7b13efc80975.html He was also America's first black owner of a national fast food franchise.  Career  After being turned down for loans by a variety of banks he was load his seed money by Dan Rooney, then manager of the Pittsburgh Steelers, to establish All Pro Fried Chicken, through which he became America's first black franchisor. His first store opened in January 1967 and at its peak, All Pro Fried Chicken, had 150 franchises and was run by Keys as a family business. In 1969 he decided he needed to diversify and following a meeting with James McLamore he agreed to take on a struggling Burger King franchise in Detroit, which he turned around using a series of innovative approaches, being credited by some for coming up with Burger King's famous saying 'Have it your way'. By 1988 he owned 13 restaurants in Detroit. In September 1970 he entered into a joint venture with Kentucky Fried Chicken to take a 50 percent stake in 6 stores in the Detroit area, as a condition to this agreement he was required to liquidate all of his All Pro Fried Chicken restaurants, most of which were sold to the franchisees. By 1972 he owned these six restaurants outright. In 1982 due to increased competition the stores had run into trouble and to secure their long term future KFC offered him to swap these six restaurants for four anywhere else in the country under the normal terms of a franchisee to which he agreed choosing four restaurants based in Albany. By 2002, when he exited the business, he owned 11 KFC franchises. Death Keys died on October 24, 2017 after complications from a stroke. He was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery.Brady Keys Jr.  Legacy  Throughout his pioneering business career Keys consistently advocated for black-owned businesses, including founding both Burger King's and KFC's Minority Franchise Associations. He was the first black board member of the International Franchise Association. In 1971 he successfully lobbied Burger King to award the contract for its first inner city restaurant construction to a Black-owned business. In 1972 he was appointed to President Nixon's Minority Business Advisory Board. In 1973 he testified in front of Congress about his work in franchising and opportunities for minorities. In 1986 whilst on the executive board of the Burger King/PUSH Economic Development Covenant he was instrumental on securing an agreement with Burger King to funnel $750,000 into the black community, which at the time was the largest commitment made by any fast-food company.

Public-key cryptosystems are convenient in that they do not require the sender and receiver to share a common secret in order to communicate securely (among other useful properties). However, they often rely on complicated mathematical computations and are thus generally much more inefficient than comparable symmetric-key cryptosystems. In many applications, the high cost of encrypting long messages in a public-key cryptosystem can be prohibitive. This is addressed by hybrid systems by using a combination of both. A hybrid cryptosystem can be constructed using any two separate cryptosystems: * a key encapsulation scheme, which is a public-key cryptosystem, and * a data encapsulation scheme, which is a symmetric-key cryptosystem. The hybrid cryptosystem is itself a public-key system, whose public and private keys are the same as in the key encapsulation scheme. Note that for very long messages the bulk of the work in encryption/decryption is done by the more efficient symmetric-key scheme, while the inefficient public- key scheme is used only to encrypt/decrypt a short key value. All practical implementations of public key cryptography today employ the use of a hybrid system. Examples include the TLS protocol which uses a public-key mechanism for key exchange (such as Diffie-Hellman) and a symmetric-key mechanism for data encapsulation (such as AES). The OpenPGP (RFC 4880) file format and the PKCS #7 (RFC 2315) file format are other examples.  Example  To encrypt a message addressed to Alice in a hybrid cryptosystem, Bob does the following: # Obtains Alice's public key. # Generates a fresh symmetric key for the data encapsulation scheme. # Encrypts the message under the data encapsulation scheme, using the symmetric key just generated. # Encrypts the symmetric key under the key encapsulation scheme, using Alice's public key. # Sends both of these encryptions to Alice. To decrypt this hybrid ciphertext, Alice does the following: # Uses her private key to decrypt the symmetric key contained in the key encapsulation segment. # Uses this symmetric key to decrypt the message contained in the data encapsulation segment. Security If both the key encapsulation and data encapsulation schemes are secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks, then the hybrid scheme inherits that property as well. However, it is possible to construct a hybrid scheme secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack even if the key encapsulation has a slightly weakened security definition (though the security of the data encapsulation must be slightly stronger).

The LMS is typically a web-based tool that allows access to learning resources. Competency Management Systems tend to have a more multidimensional and comprehensive approach and include tools such as competency management, skills-gap analysis, succession planning, as well as competency analysis and profiling. The CompMS tends to focus more on creating an environment of sustainable competency in addition to entering and tracking learning resources in software. However, conceptually, there is no reason why a CompMS or LMS could not be manual (i.e. not computer-based) and indeed learning management systems are as old as learning institutions. One view is that competency management systems may be based on adult learning and occupational task analysis principles, such as DACUM,DACUM which identify the business processes in a company and break them down into tasks. These tasks are what an individual needs to do in their work. Modern techniques use competency-based management methodologies to develop a competency architecture for an organization. This architecture captures key competencies into a competency dictionary that is subsequently used in the creation of job descriptions. Competency-based performance management can then be employed to measure and discover learning gaps that then drive the training course selections for an employee. There is as yet no generally agreed definition of competence. This lack of consensus at the moment can be seen by the efforts of the IEEE to define standards in the area of competency, such as their 1484 series of standards; for example, see the standard for reusable competency definitions. To some people, the term competence may be synonymous with skills. To others, a broader definition of competence would be that competence = skills + knowledge + behaviours. For example, educational institutions (certainly higher educational institutions) are more focussed on the informational dimension of competence. Hence for many professions, formal education and graduation are followed by a period of practice typically under the direction of qualified practitioners. Such post-education practical work is where someone picks up skills and behaviours needed to be a competent practitioner. The need to acquire education, skills, and an ability to perform professional behaviour are frequently the requirements of a competent practitioner. More sophisticated definitions of competence or competency would add two more dimensions: (1) the 'level' at which a person may be required to work 'competently', and (2) the context in which a competence is being exercised. As used by The Gill Payne Partnership Ltd extensively within the energy sector since 1992, their definition of competence is \\"The ability for a person to perform a required and/or specified activity, safely, to a set standard, and under varying conditions\\". In the competence standards they create for clients and use within their systems, they develop Performance Standards and, Knowledge and Understanding Standards. Performance Standards are those activities that people are expected to do in the job role, if you like ‚Äì what the role entails in the way of practical activity ‚Äì the 'how' and 'what' of the job role. Knowledge and Understanding Standards are the 'what the person is expected to know and understand' in fulfilling their job role, the 'why' the how and what are done in the job. It is quite common for their clients to ask about separate Behaviour and Attitude Standards however, The Gill Payne Partnership Ltd usually embeds these within the Performance Standards as they are in effect, a 'practical activity' required in the role i.e., 'certain behaviours and/or attitudes are required to be demonstrated' in the job role. An early discussion of competence management can be found in a paper by Darnton. The maintenance of a set of competencies in an organization of, say, 40,000 employees is particularly challenging. Classroom-based, or training course are not easy to use to provide the scale necessary to maintain the competences of such a large number of people. A typical sequence of activities to use a competence management system in such a situation looks like this: # Identify all things that need to be done by people in the organization in order to provide an inventory of required competencies and audit the competencies currently available; # Use the strategy of the organization to define the competencies needed in order to implement the strategy; # Perform a 'gap analysis' (in the cases of both 1 and 2) to identify the competencies currently available to the organization and the competencies it actually needs; # Use the results of the gap analysis to identify the competence development needed if the organization is to have the competencies it needs; # Commission the required competence development; # Manage training. As the required development is being done, it will probably be necessary to use a learning management system to manage all the required learning; developing or maintaining the competence of a 40,000 person workforce will usually require careful use of all aspects of blended learning. A competence management system is able to track the competence requirements of the organization and identify any remaining gaps. It is also able to track the experience of people to add to their learning in order to provide an evidence base for assertions of competence. Typically, an organization will also establish and maintain a competence dictionary. Modern Competency Management The problem with traditional competency management is that it perceives competency development as specific event-based interventions (e.g., \\"manage training\\"). Newer definitions take into account that unlike training, which is an event, learning is a process that should never end. Organizations recognizing that changes in skill requirements are now the norm, understand that only a culture of learning will enable people to remain competent through lifelong learning. They use systems and processes that intrinsically motivate people within their organizations to want to learn continuously. That enables people do self-develop at scale, such that number of people in an organization is no longer a challenge.

Several major territorial changes occurred during the Venetian rule in those regions, starting from 1392, and lasting until 1797. By the end of the 15th century, the main possessions in northern Albania had been lost to the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. In spite of that, Venetians did not want to renounce their formal claims to the Albanian coast, and the term Venetian Albania was officially kept in use, designating the remaining Venetian possessions in coastal Montenegro, centered around the Bay of Kotor. Those regions remained under Venetian rule until the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. By the Treaty of Campo Formio, the region was transferred to the Habsburg Monarchy. Geography Venice used the term \\"Venetian Albania\\" for its initial possessions that stretched from the southern borders of the Republic of Ragusa to Durr√´s in coastal Albania. Generally these possessions extended not more than 20 km (12 miles) inland from the Adriatic Sea. Between the Siege of Shkodra and 1571 the territories in what is today Albania were lost. After 1573 the southern limit moved to the village of Kufin (which means border in Albanian) near Budva, because of the Ottoman conquests of Antivari (Bar), Dulcigno (Ulcinj), Scutari (Shkod√´r) and Durr√´s. From then on, the Venetian territory was centered on the Bay of Kotor, and included the towns of Kotor, Risan, Perast, Tivat, Herceg Novi, Budva, and Sutomore. From 1718 to 1797 the Venetian Republic extended its territory south towards the Republic of Ragusa while maintaining the enclaves of Cattaro (Kotor) and Budua (Budva). History Standard-bearer of Perast (1634). Map of the Bay of Kotor (1789). The Venetians sporadically controlled the small southern Dalmatian villages around the 10th century, but did not permanently assume control until 1420. The Venetians assimilated the Dalmatian language into the Venetian language quickly. The Venetian territories around Kotor lasted from 1420 to 1797 and were called Venetian Albania, a province of the Venetian Republic. In the early years of the Renaissance the territories under Venetian control included areas from modern coastal Montenegro to northern Albania as far as Durr√´s: Venice retained this city after a siege by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1466, but it fell to Ottoman forces in 1501. At that time Venetian Albania was relatively rich, and the area around the city of Kotor enjoyed a huge cultural and artistic development. When the Ottoman Empire started to conquer the Balkans in the 15th century, the population of Christian Slavs in Dalmatia increased greatly. As a consequence of this, by the end of the 17th century the Romance-speaking population of the historical Venetian Albania was a minority, according to Oscar Randi. After the French Republic conquered the Venetian Republic, the area of Venetian Albania became part of the Austrian Empire under the Treaty of Campo Formio, and then part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy under the Peace of Pressburg, and then the French Illyrian Provinces under the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn. In 1814 it was again included in the Austrian Empire. Towns *Cattaro. Four centuries of Venetian domination gave the city the typical Venetian architecture, that contributed to make Kotor a UNESCO world heritage site. *Perast. Once part of Venetian Albania, was at its peak in the 18th century, when it had as many as four active shipyards, a standing fleet of around a hundred ships, and 1,643 residents. At that time a number of architecturally significant buildings were constructed in this fortified town. Many ornate baroque palaces and houses were decorated the town of Perast, built in the Venetian style. Citizens of Perast (the population was around 1,600 at the time) enjoyed privileges from the Venetian Republic. They were allowed to trade with large ships and to sell goods without tax on the Venetian market, which created considerable income for the town. *Budva. The Venetians ruled the town for nearly 400 years, from 1420 to 1797. Budva, called \\"Budua\\" in those centuries, was part of the Venetian Republic region of Albania Veneta and was fortified by powerful Venetian walls against Ottoman conquests. According to the historian Luigi Paulucci in his book \\"Le Bocche di Cattaro nel 1810\\" (The Bay of Kotor in 1810), most of the population spoke the Venetian language until the beginning of the 19th century. One of the most renowned theater librettists and composers, Cristoforo Ivanovich, was born in Venetian Budua. Budua (1900).jpg|Budva, 1900 postcard Perasto (1900).jpg|Perast, 1900 postcard Cattaro09370v.jpg|Postcard of Old Cattaro, showing typical venetian architecture buildings and the \\"Clock tower\\" Population According to the Dalmatian historian Luigi Paulucci (in his book Le Bocche di Cattaro nel 1810) the population of Venetian Albania, during the centuries of the Republic of Venice, was mainly Venetian speaking (approximately 66%) in the urban areas (Cattaro, Perasto, Budua, etc) around the \\"Bocche di Cattaro\\" (Bay of Kotor). Venetian Albania in purple But in the inland areas more than half of the population was Serbo-Croatian speaking, after the first years of the 18th century. Paulucci wrote that near the border with Albania there were large communities of Albanian-speaking people: Ulcinj was half Albanian, one quarter Venetian and one quarter Slavic-speaking.Paulucci, Luigi. Le Bocche di Cattaro nel 1810 Edizioni Italo Svevo. Trieste, 2005. After the disappearance of the Venetian Albania, during the nineteenth century (according to the historian Marzio Scaglioni) the wars of independence of Italy from the Austro-Hungarian empire created a situation of harassment against the Italian (or Venetian speaking) communities in the Austrian southern dalmatia. The result was that in 1880 there were in Cattaro, according to the Austrian census, only 930 ethnic Italians (or only 32% of a total population of 2910 people). Furthermore, in the Austrian census of 1910, the Italians were reduced to only 13.6% in that city. Today there are 500 Italian speaking in Montenegro, mainly in the area of Cattaro (Kotor), who constitute the \\"Comunit√° Nazionale Italiana del Montenegro\\". Notable people Many notable people were born in the \\"Cattaro Bay\\" (now called Bay of Kotor) during the Venetian rule. These included: *Notable Italian-language writers in the 15th to 18th centuries who originated from Venetian Albania, notably Giovanni Bona Boliris, Cristoforo Ivanovich, Ludovico Pasquali, Tomo Medin, Stefano Zannowich and others. *The first South Slavic printer Andrija Palta≈°iƒá was born in Venetian Cattaro in 1440.Be≈°iƒá, Zarij M.

It can be divided up into several discrete periods defined by the principal means of motive power used. Horse-drawn The Welsh Swansea and Mumbles Railway ran the world's first passenger tram service in 1807 Mule- drawn streetcar, Houston, USA, 1870s An Adelaide, South Australia horse tram and employees at the depot (probably Unley) about 1910 The Douglas Bay Horse Tramway in Douglas, Isle of Man was still operating as of 2017 The world's first passenger tram was the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, in Wales, UK. The Mumbles Railway Act was passed by the British Parliament in 1804, and this first horse-drawn passenger tramway started operating in 1807. It was worked by steam from 1877, and then, from 1929, by very large (106-seater) electric tramcars, until closure in 1961. The first streetcar in America, developed by John Stephenson, began service in the year 1832.The John Stephenson Car Co. Retrieved 25 February 2009. This was the New York and Harlem Railroad's Fourth Avenue Line which ran along the Bowery and Fourth Avenue in New York City. These trams were an animal railway, usually using horses and sometimes mules to haul the cars, usually two as a team. Rarely, other animals were tried, including humans in emergency circumstances. It was followed in 1835 by New Orleans, Louisiana, which is the oldest continuously operating street railway system in the world, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The first tram in Continental Europe opened in France in 1839 between Montbrison and Montrond, on the streets inside the towns, and on the roadside outside town. It had permission for steam traction, but was entirely run with horse traction. In 1848, it was closed down after repeated economic failure. The tram developed in numerous cities of Europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in Berlin, Budapest, Birmingham, Leningrad, Lisbon, London, Manchester, Paris). The first tram in South America opened in 1858 in Santiago, Chile. The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in Sydney. Africa's first tram service started in Alexandria on 8 January 1863. The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia). Problems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing of. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar. Horsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from overhead wires by Frank J. Sprague. His spring-loaded trolley pole used a wheel to travel along the wire. In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in Richmond, Virginia. Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents. Horses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century. Many large metropolitan lines lasted well into the early twentieth century. New York City had a regular horsecar service on the Bleecker Street Line until its closure in 1917.\\"New York Loses its Last Horse Car\\" New York Times July 29, 1917. page 12 Pittsburgh, had its Sarah Street line drawn by horses until 1923. The last regular mule-drawn cars in the US ran in Sulphur Rock, Arkansas, until 1926 and were commemorated by a U.S. postage stamp issued in 1983. The last mule tram service in Mexico City ended in 1932, and a mule tram in Celaya, Mexico, survived until 1954. The last horse-drawn tram to be withdrawn from public service in the UK took passengers from Fintona railway station to Fintona Junction one mile away on the main Omagh to Enniskillen railway in Northern Ireland. The tram made its last journey on 30 September 1957 when the Omagh to Enniskillen line closed. The van now lies at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum. Horse-drawn trams still operate on the 1876-built Douglas Bay Horse Tramway on the Isle of Man, and at the 1894-built Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram, in Adelaide, South Australia. New horse-drawn systems have been established at the Hokkaid≈ç Museum in Japan and also in Disneyland. Steam Cologne-Bonn railway, pulling a train through Br√ºhl marketplace, around 1900 The first mechanical trams were powered by steam. Generally, there were two types of steam tram. The first and most common had a small steam locomotive (called a tram engine in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages, similar to a small train. Systems with such steam trams included Christchurch, New Zealand; Adelaide, South Australia; Sydney, Australia and other city systems in New South Wales; Munich, Germany (from August 1883 on), British India (Pakistan) (from 1885) and the Dublin & Blessington Steam Tramway (from 1888) in Ireland. Steam tramways also were used on the suburban tramway lines around Milan and Padua; the last Gamba de Legn (\\"Peg-Leg\\") tramway ran on the Milan-Magenta-Castano Primo route in late 1958. The other style of steam tram had the steam engine in the body of the tram, referred to as a tram engine (UK) or steam dummy (US). The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in Rockhampton, in the Australian state of Queensland between 1909 and 1939. Stockholm, Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of S√∂dermalm between 1887 and 1901. Tram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used coke rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; condensers or superheating were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam tram engines faded out around 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams. Cable-hauled London and Blackwall cable-operated railway, 1840 San Francisco cable car: a cable pulled system, still operating Another motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a fixed track by a moving steel cable. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a \\"powerhouse\\" site a distance away from the actual vehicle. The London and Blackwall Railway, which opened for passengers in East London, England, in 1840 used such a system. The first practical cable car line was tested in San Francisco, in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable cable grip mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was Dunedin in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957. The most extensive cable system in the US was built in Chicago between 1882 and 1906. New York City developed at least seven cable car lines. Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898. St Kilda Line in Melbourne in 1905. Trams on George Street, Sydney, circa 1919‚Äì20. Sydney once had the largest tram network in the world. From 1885 to 1940, the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on of track, though during its heyday, Sydney's network was larger,From ABC-TV's 'Can you help?'. Sydney, the largest city in Australia, once had the largest tram system in Australia, the second largest in the Commonwealth (after London), and one of the largest in the world. In the early 1960s the entire network was dismantled. with about 1,600 cars in service at any one time at its peak during the 1930s (cf. about 500 trams in Melbourne today). There were also two isolated cable lines in Sydney, the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900,Trams in Sydney and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905. Sydney's tram network ceased to serve the city population by the 1960s, with all tracks being removed, in lieu of a bus service. Melbourne's tram network, however, continues to run to this day. In Dresden, Germany, in 1901 an elevated suspended cable car following the Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system started operating. Cable cars operated on Highgate Hill in North London and Kennington to Brixton Hill in South London. They also worked around \\"Upper Douglas\\" in the Isle of Man from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet). Cable cars suffered from high infrastructure costs, since an expensive system of cables, pulleys, stationary engines and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected (\\"dropped\\") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be \\"picked up\\" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) would have to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations. Cable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not lose traction as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and track brakes, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco. The San Francisco cable cars, though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known tourist attraction. A single cable line also survives in Wellington, New Zealand (rebuilt in 1979 as a funicular but still called the Wellington Cable Car). Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of Llandudno up to the top of the Great Orme hill in North Wales, UK. Gas In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, naphtha gas or coal gas in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between Alphington and Clifton Hill in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia (1886‚Äì1888); in Berlin and Dresden, Germany; in Estonia (1920s‚Äì1930); between Jelenia G√≥ra, Cieplice, and Sobiesz√≥w in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at Lytham St Annes, Neath (1896‚Äì1920), and Trafford Park, Manchester (1897‚Äì1908). On 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper The Argus reprinted a report from the San Francisco Bulletin that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'. Comparatively little has been published about gas trams. However, research on the subject was carried out for an article in the October 2011 edition of \\"The Times\\", the historical journal of the Australian Association of Timetable Collectors, now the Australian Timetable Association. A tram system powered by compressed natural gas was due to open in Malaysia in 2012, but the news about the project appears to have dried up. Electric Lichterfelde tram in Berlin, 1882 Volks Electric Railway, built in 1883, is still in operation First type of M√∂dling and Hinterbr√ºhl Tramcars, powered by bipolar overhead line, 1883 Fully restored 1920 Toronto streetcar Double-decker tram in Blackpool Melbourne, 1890s The world's first experimental electric tramway was built by Russian inventor Fyodor Pirotsky near St Petersburg in 1875. The first commercially successful electric tram line operated in Lichterfelde near Berlin, Germany, in 1881. It was built by Werner von Siemens (see Berlin Stra√üenbahn). It initially drew current from the rails, with overhead wire being installed in 1883.\\"This is how some of the world's familiar...\\" Popular Mechanics, May 1929, pg. 750. via Google Books. In Britain, the Volk's Electric Railway was opened in 1883 in Brighton. This two kilometer line, re-gauged to in 1884, remains in service to this day, and is the oldest operating electric tramway in the world. Also in 1883, M√∂dling and Hinterbr√ºhl Tram was opened near Vienna in Austria. It was the first tram in the world in regular service that was run with electricity served by an overhead line with pantograph current collectors. The Blackpool Tramway, was opened in Blackpool, England on 29 September 1885 using conduit collection along Blackpool Promenade. This system is still in operation in a modernised form. Earliest tram system in Canada was by John Joseph Wright, brother of the famous mining entrepreneur Whitaker Wright, in Toronto in 1883. In the US, multiple functioning experimental electric trams were exhibited at the 1884 World Cotton Centennial World's Fair in New Orleans, Louisiana, but they were not deemed good enough to replace the Lamm fireless engines then propelling the St Charles Streetcar in that city. The first commercial installation of an electric streetcar in the United States was built in 1884 in Cleveland, Ohio and operated for a period of one year by the East Cleveland Street Railway Company. Trams were operated in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888, on the Richmond Union Passenger Railway built by Frank J. Sprague. Sprague later developed multiple unit control, first demonstrated in Chicago in 1897, allowing multiple cars to be coupled together and operated by a single motorman. This gave birth to the modern subway train. Following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on streetcars for collecting electricity from overhead wires by Frank J. Sprague, electric tram systems were rapidly adopted across the world. Earlier installations proved difficult or unreliable. Siemens' line, for example, provided power through a live rail and a return rail, like a model train, limiting the voltage that could be used, and providing electric shocks to people and animals crossing the tracks. Siemens later designed his own version of overhead current collection, called the bow collector, and Thorold, Ontario, opened in 1887, and was considered quite successful at the time. While this line proved quite versatile as one of the earliest fully functional electric streetcar installations, it required horse-drawn support while climbing the Niagara Escarpment and for two months of the winter when hydroelectricity was not available. It continued in service in its original form into the 1950s. Sidney Howe Short designed and produced the first electric motor that operated a streetcar without gears. The motor had its armature direct-connected to the streetcar's axle for the driving force. Short pioneered \\"use of a conduit system of concealed feed\\" thereby eliminating the necessity of overhead wire, trolley poles and a trolley for street cars and railways. While at the University of Denver he conducted important experiments which established that multiple unit powered cars were a better way to operate trains and trolleys. Sarajevo built a citywide system of electric trams in 1885. Budapest established its tramway system in 1887, and its ring line has grown to be the busiest tram line in Europe, with a tram running every 60 seconds at rush hour. Bucharest and Belgrade ran a regular service from 1894. Ljubljana introduced its tram system in 1901 ‚Äì it closed in 1958. The first electric tramway in Australia was a Sprague system demonstrated at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in Melbourne; afterwards, this was installed as a commercial venture operating between the outer Melbourne suburbs of Box Hill and Doncaster from 1889 to 1896. As well, electric systems were built in Adelaide, Ballarat, Bendigo, Brisbane, Fremantle, Geelong, Hobart, Kalgoorlie, Launceston, Leonora, Newcastle, Perth and Sydney. By the 1970s, the only tramway system remaining in Australia was the Melbourne tram system other than a few single lines remaining elsewhere: the Glenelg tram line, connecting Adelaide to the beachside suburb of Glenelg, and tourist trams in the Victorian Goldfields cities of Ballarat and Bendigo. In recent years the Melbourne system, generally recognised as one of the largest in the world, has been considerably modernised and expanded. The Adelaide line has also been extended to the Entertainment Centre, and there are plans to expand further. In Japan, the Kyoto Electric railroad was the first tram system, starting operation in 1895.Kyoto Tram from Kyoto City Web. Retrieved 12 February 2009. By 1932, the network had grown to 82 railway companies in 65 cities, with a total network length of .The Rebirth of Trams from the JFS Newsletter, December 2007. Retrieved 12 February 2009. By the 1960s the tram had generally died out in Japan. Two rare but significant alternatives were conduit current collection, which was widely used in London, Washington, D.C. and New York City, and the surface contact collection method, used in Wolverhampton (the Lorain system), Torquay and Hastings in the UK (the Dolter stud system), and currently in Bordeaux, France (the ground-level power supply system). The convenience and economy of electricity resulted in its rapid adoption once the technical problems of production and transmission of electricity were solved. Electric trams largely replaced animal power and other forms of motive power including cable and steam, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There is one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as saloon lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts. In British terminology such a tram was said to be ‚Äògrounded‚Äô‚Äînot to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram. The water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails. In the 2000s, two companies introduced catenary-free designs. The Alstom Citadis line uses a third rail, and Bombardier's Primove LRV is charged by contactless induction plates embedded in the trackway.Wordpress.com , \\"The transport politic\\" Battery As early as 1834, Thomas Davenport, a Vermont blacksmith, had invented a battery-powered electric motor which he later patented. The following year he used it to operate a small model electric car on a short section of track four feet in diameter.Electrifying America by David E. Nye, p.86, from Google Books. Retrieved 14 February 2009.Thomas Davenport from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . Retrieved 14 February 2009. Attempts to use batteries as a source of electricity were made from the 1880s and 1890s, with unsuccessful trials conducted in among other places Bendigo and Adelaide in Australia, and for about 14 years as The Hague accutram of HTM in the Netherlands. The first trams in Bendigo, Australia, in 1892, were battery- powered but within as little as three months they were replaced with horse- drawn trams. In New York City some minor lines also used storage batteries. Then, comparatively recently, during the 1950s, a longer battery-operated tramway line ran from Milan to Bergamo. In China there is a Nanjing battery Tram line and has been running since 2014. Other power sources The only petrol-driven tram of Stockholms Sp√•rv√§gar, on line 19 in the 1920s In some places, other forms of power were used to power the tram. Hastings and some other tramways, for example Stockholms Sp√•rv√§gar in Sweden and some lines in Karachi, used petrol trams. Paris operated trams that were powered by compressed air using the Mekarski system. Galveston Island Trolley in Texas operated diesel trams due to the city's hurricane-prone location, which would result in frequent damage to an electrical supply system. Although Portland, Victoria promotes its tourist tram as being a cable car it actually operates using a hidden diesel motor. The tram, which runs on a circular route around the town of Portland, uses dummies and salons formerly used on the extensive Melbourne cable tramway system and now beautifully restored. In March 2015, China South Rail Corporation (CSR) demonstrated the world's first hydrogen fuel cell vehicle tramcar at an assembly facility in Qingdao. The chief engineer of the CSR subsidiary CRRC Qingdao Sifang, Liang Jianying, said that the company is studying how to reduce the running costs of the tram. Hybrid systems A cable tractor assisting a tramcar on the cable section of the Opicina Tramway in Trieste, Italy. The Trieste‚ÄìOpicina tramway in Trieste operates a hybrid funicular tramway system. Conventional electric trams are operated in street running and on reserved track for most of their route. However, on one steep segment of track, they are assisted by cable tractors, which push the trams uphill and act as brakes for the downhill run. For safety, the cable tractors are always deployed on the downhill side of the tram vehicle. Similar systems were used elsewhere in the past, notably on the Queen Anne Counterbalance in Seattle and the Darling Street wharf line in Sydney. Rail profile At first the rails protruded above street level, causing accidents and problems for pedestrians. They were supplanted in 1852 by grooved rails or girder rails, invented by Alphonse Loubat.Conf√©rence sur Alphonse LOUBAT, inventeur du tramway . In French. Retrieved 11 February 2009. Loubat, inspired by Stephenson, built the first tramline in Paris, France. The line was inaugurated on 21 November 1853, in connection with the 1855 World Fair, running on a trial basis from Place de la Concorde to Pont de S√®vres and later to the village of Boulogne.John Prentice: Tramway Origins and Pioneers.

The Toronto streetcar system is one of the few in North America still operating in the classic style on street trackage shared with car traffic, where streetcars stop on demand at frequent stops like buses rather than having fixed stations.

Retrieved 11 February 2009. Decline Copenhagen tram, January 1969. (Grossraumtriebwagen 524) The then obsolete tram model would soon be phased out, and the entire system closed. The advent of personal motor vehicles and the improvements in motorized buses caused the rapid disappearance of the tram from most western and Asian countries by the end of the 1950s (for example the first major UK city to completely abandon its trams was Manchester by January 1949). Continuing technical and reliability improvements in buses made them a serious competitor to trams because they did not require the construction of costly infrastructure. However, the demise of the streetcar came when lines were torn out of the major cities by \\"bus manufacturing or oil marketing companies for the specific purpose of replacing rail service with buses.\\" In many cases postwar buses were cited as providing a smoother ride and a faster journey than the older, prewar trams. For example, the tram network survived in Budapest but for a considerable period of time bus fares were higher to recognize the superior quality of the buses. However, many riders protested against the replacement of streetcars arguing that buses weren't as smooth or efficient and polluted the air. In the United States, there have been allegations that the Great American streetcar scandal was responsible for the replacement of trains with buses, but critics of this theory point to evidence that larger economic forces were driving conversion before General Motors' actions and outside of its reach. Certainly the oldest system of all, the Swansea and Mumbles Railway of 1807, was purchased by The South Wales Transport Company (which operated a large motor bus fleet in the area) and despite vociferous local opposition, closed down in 1960. Governments thus put investment principally into bus networks. Indeed, infrastructure for roads and highways meant for the automobile were perceived as a mark of progress. The priority given to roads is illustrated in the proposal of French president Georges Pompidou who declared in 1971 that \\"the city must adapt to the car\\". Tram networks were no longer maintained or modernized, a state of affairs that served to discredit them in the eyes of the public. Old lines, considered archaic, were then gradually replaced by buses. Tram networks disappeared almost completely from France, the UK, and altogether from Ireland, Denmark, Spain, as well as being completely removed from cities such as Sydney, which had one of the largest networks in the world with route length and Brisbane. The vast majority of tram networks also disappeared in North America, but American cities Boston, Philadelphia, Newark, San Francisco, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Canadian city Toronto, and Mexico City still retained trams. This situation occurred in Italy and Netherlands, too. There are preserved system in Milan, Rome, Naples, Turin, Ritten and between Trieste and Opicina, and in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. On the other hand, tram systems were generally retained or modernized in most communist countries, as well as Switzerland, West Germany, Austria, Belgium, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Japan etc. though cuts and closures of entire systems also happened there as the example of Hamburg shows. In France, only the networks in Lille, Saint-√âtienne and Marseille, survive from this period, but they all suffered significant reduction from their original size. In Great Britain, only the Blackpool Tramway kept running, with an extensive system which includes some street running in Blackpool, and a long stretch of segregated track to nearby Fleetwood. Resurgences Strasbourg, 2004 A Siemens Combino tram in Amsterdam, 2004 An Italian produced Sirio tram in Gothenburg, 2006 The priority given to personal vehicles and notably to the automobile led to a loss in quality of life, particularly in large cities where smog, traffic congestion, sound pollution and parking became problematic. Acknowledging this, some authorities saw fit to redefine their transport policies. Rapid transit required a heavy investment and presented problems in terms of subterranean spaces that required constant security. For rapid transit, the investment was mainly in underground construction, which made it impossible in some cities (with underground water reserves, archaeological remains, etc.). Metro construction thus was not a universal panacea. The advantages of the tram thus became once again visible. At the end of the 1970s, some governments studied, and then built new tram lines. In Germany the Stadtbahnwagen B was a modern tram (or tram-train) hybrid built to run on heavy rail tracks in a premetro type of system. The renaissance of light rail in North America began in 1978 when the Canadian city of Edmonton adopted the German Siemens-Duewag U2 system, followed three years later by Calgary and San Diego. 1980s and 1990s Britain began replacing its run-down local railways with light rail in the 1980s, starting with the Tyne & Wear Metro in Tyneside followed by the Docklands Light Railway in London. The trend to light rail in the United Kingdom was firmly established with the success of the Manchester Metrolink system and Sheffield Supertram in 1992, followed by Midland Metro in Birmingham in 1999, and Tramlink in London in 2000. In France, Nantes and Grenoble led the way in terms of the modern tram, and new systems were inaugurated in 1985 and 1988. In 1994 Strasbourg opened a system with novel British-built trams, specified by the city, with the goal of breaking with the archaic conceptual image that was held by the public. A great example of this shift in ideology is the city of Munich, which began replacing its tram network with a metro a few years before the 1972 Summer Olympics. When the metro network was finished in the 1990s the city began to tear out the tram network (which had become rather old and decrepit), but now faced opposition from many citizens who enjoyed the enhanced mobility of the mixed network‚Äîthe metro lines deviate from the tram lines to a significant degree. New rolling stock was purchased and the system was modernized, and a new line was proposed in 2003. In Berlin, in 1990, ADtranz low floor tram, the world's first completely low floor tram was introduced. West Berlin had shut down its trams in the 1960s but the East reversed a previous decision to shut down the tramway network and new lines have been laid into the western part of Berlin after reunification. 21st Century The 2004 Summer Olympics that prompted the redevelopment of trams as part of the Athens Mass Transit System. The tramways in Athens are integrated with the revived Athens Metro system, as well as the buses, trolleybuses and suburban trains. In Melbourne, Australia, the already extensive tramway system continues to be extended. In 2004 the Mont Albert line was extended several kilometres to Box Hill, whilst in 2005 the Burwood East line was extended several kilometres to Vermont South. In Sydney, trams returned in the form of light rail with the opening of the Inner West Light Rail line in 1997, which has seen extensions and now covers . In Prague, in 2009, ≈†koda 15 T, the world's first completely low-floor tram with articulated bogies was introduced. In Scotland, Edinburgh relaunched its tram network on 31 May 2014 after delayed development which began in 2008. Edinburgh previously had an extensive tram network which began closure in the 1950s.http://www.grantonhistory.org/transport/edinburgh_tram_maps.htm The new network is significantly smaller, 8.7 miles, compared to the previous tram network, 47.25 miles. Systems such as tram-trains are bringing rail based transit to areas that never had it and would not otherwise have gotten it. The Karlsruhe model was one of the first in the modern era and provided one seat rides where several connections would have been necessary before, increasing ridership by significant amounts upon opening of service compared to prior bus or local train routes. Modern development While many networks closed down during the postwar decades, the rolling stock on remaining systems kept developing, with multi-car trains (or articulated trams) with double-end designs and automatic control systems, allowing a single driver to serve more passengers, and decreasing turnaround time. Passenger and driver comfort have improved with stuffed seats and cabin heating. Advertising on trams, including all-over striping, became common. The resurgence in the late 20th and 21st century has seen development of new technologies such as driverless automatic train operation in trams in Potsdam, low-floor trams and regenerative braking.

History The earliest vestiges of human occupation date back to 50,000 years B.C. (pertaining to the middle Paleolithic), associated with the interior of the cave. The first occupants of the cave came from groups of Neanderthal hunter-gatherers, who used the cave as a temporary shelter in order to hunt. Based on bone evidence within the cave, these groups hunted nearby aurochs, deer and horse. Elements of rock art also pertain to the Upper Paleolithic (40,000 to 10,000 years B.C.) or final parts of the Neolithic period, when the interior was used as a funerary site, while a small settlement inhabited the area in the exterior. During the Chalcolithic period, a human settlement existed within the cave, developing into a fortified site by the end of Copper Age. A series of archaeological investigations began in 1963, under Manuel Farinha dos Santos, which continued in 1980, while a team of international investigators performed soundings in 1989. In 1999 it was included in the Programa de Valoriza√ß√£o e Divulga√ß√£o Tur√≠stica: Itiner√°rios Arqueol√≥gicos do Alentejo e Algarve, under the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism and Secretary-of-State of Culture, in order to monetize the sight as a tourist pole. As a result, an interpretative centre was constructed from a local traditional building, then expanded, reopened in 2011 after new public works. Architecture The rock-art site is located along the E.N.370 motorway between Santiago do Escoural and Alto da Abaneja, approximately five kilometres from the latter. A side road towards the east, in the direction of Herdade da Sala, in the locality of Fonte Nova, directs the traveller to a marble outcropping and cliff face embedded in igneous rock, on which the archaeological site is found. It is in an isolated rural location between the Tagus River and Sado River basins and the plains region of the Alentejo, near other important megalithic monuments, including the Cromolech of Almendres and the dolmen Anta Grande do Zambujeiro. A complex subterranean structure, the cave is an irregular plan that extends longitudinally northwest to southeast, consisting of a network of horizontal halls and galleries at different levels sealed within a thick flowstone mantle. Although the excavation and investigation of the cave has been studied since the 1960s, prospecting in the cave has yet to be concluded. The cave, which develops in a very tangled and karst network with multiple connections to the outside, is located within a steep cliff of hard limestone. The latest surveys, made in 1989 (Silva and others, 1991), have revealed new chambers, resulting in further progressive investigations. Beyond the important cave art, paintings and engravings, the underground system has revealed numerous funerary burial sites dating from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic, with a universe of interesting artifacts. Outdoors, in an area defined by the extent of the cliff face, there were recorded traces of a village that existed throughout the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. The monument is a singular example of Neolithic Portuguese archaeology, whose prehistoric art paintings are comparable to those of Altamira and Lascaux. The site was the first in Portugal in which prehistoric art was identified, and the only location that has examples of Paleolithic artwork. There have been identified hundreds of motifs, engravings and paintings of animals, abstract forms and geometric shapes in the archaeological site.

The novel first appeared in serialised form in The New York Times Magazine, in sixteen installments published from September 17, 2006 to January 21, 2007.  Plot summary Evidence mounts that the murder is part of a terrorist plot to build and deploy a dirty bomb, justifying the FBI's moves to push the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and Bosch to the sidelines. Refusing to be sidelined, Bosch aggressively works around the FBI in order to track down Stanley Kent's killers, much to the chagrin of his young, inexperienced partner, who sees his career at the LAPD jeopardized by Bosch's actions. The FBI agents, including Rachel Walling, view Bosch as endangering their attempts to retrieve the missing cesium and to track down known terrorists. Relying on instinct and experience, Bosch pursues his line of inquiry, ultimately succeeding in solving the murder and recovering the cesium. The principal players in the story are: Harry Bosch, the lead detective on the case, who is the principal protagonist of this and twelve previous Harry Bosch novels. Rachel Walling, who was romantically involved with Harry in a number of previous Harry Bosch novels. In this story, while Harry has hopes of re- connecting with Rachel, their relationship is strained, owing to conflicting views on how the investigation should be carried out. Ignacio \\"Iggy\\" Ferras, Bosch's young partner. Iggy wants to play by the book and is seriously disturbed by Bosch's let's-break-the-rules attitude. At one point, he tells Bosch that he can't work with him and will be requesting a new partner. Stanley Kent, the murder victim who has stolen 32 sources of cesium from a Los Angeles hospital in response to demands from unknown parties who have taken his wife hostage. If used in a dirty bomb, tens of thousands of people could die from radiation exposure. Alicia Kent, the beautiful wife of the murder victim, who was taken hostage in her home by two intruders. She was used by the intruders to pressure Stanley Kent to steal the cesium from the hospital. Jack Brenner, Rachel Walling's FBI partner and superior and the lead FBI agent on the case. His primary concern is dealing with the terror threat associated with the stolen cesium. To him, Bosch's homicide investigation is a secondary concern. Cliff Maxwell, an FBI agent working on the case, with whom Bosch has two violent encounters.

Sometimes referred to as Owston or Ferry, the village forms part of the Isle of Axholme. It is bounded to the west by the A161 road and the village of Haxey. The River Trent is directly to the east. To the north, beyond a number of hamlets and villages, lies the River Humber. West Butterwick was originally a part of the township of Owston.

(1991) A Dictionary of English Place-Names, Oxford University Press a view shared by other sources which outline that it specifically implied the \\"farmstead east of Haxey\\". The name \\"Owston\\" is shared by at least two other settlements within the United Kingdom. In the 1086 Domesday Book it is listed as \\"Ostone\\", Owston Ferry Castle, also known as Kinnard's Ferry Castle, was a motte-and-bailey fortification from the 12th century.

Since 1996 however, Owston Ferry has formed part of the unitary authority area of North Lincolnshire. Assessment as nuclear site In 2009, a specific area of land in Owston Ferry was highlighted in a study by W. S. Atkins for the Department of Energy on alternative sites for a nuclear power plant as a potentially suitable site \\"worthy of further consideration\\". (It had featured in a 1970s CEGB list of possible sites for such plant.) By 2010, the Department had issued another document saying it had given the matter further consideration; it had concluded that, although the site nominally met its \\"strategic site assessment criteria\\" for new nuclear power sites, it was not a credible site for deployment of new nuclear by the end of 2025 ‚Äì adding that anyway, no firm had expressed any interest in building such plant there.

Originally located in Hooper Strait, between Hooper and Bloodsworth Islands in Dorchester County and at the entrance to Tangier Sound, it is now an exhibit at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels, Maryland. History Lightships were stationed at this site beginning in 1827, including one destroyed by confederate forces during the Civil War. In 1867 a square screw-pile structure was erected. It survived only ten years; in January 1877 ice tore the house loose and sent it floating down the bay. The keeper John S. Cornwell and his assistant barely escaped using one of the light's boats, and were trapped on the ice for 24 hours before being rescued. In spite of frostbite, Cornwell said that \\"should there be another house erected, or a boat placed in the site of the old one, Capt. Conway [his assistant] and myself will be ready to take charge of it[.]\\" Lighthouse tenders sent after the sunken house located it some five miles (8 km) south of the strait and were able to salvage the lens, lamp, and fog bell. On display at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum A new light was erected at the same location in 1879, another screw-pile light of the then typical hexagonal form, with the house being prefabricated at the Lazarretto Point depot. John Cornwell did in fact become the first keeper of the new light. In 1882 a red sector was fitted. This light remained manned until 1954, at which point it was automated and the house boarded up. In the 1960s the Coast Guard had taken to removing the houses from the old screw-pile lights in order to cut maintenance costs and avoid vandalism; a skeleton tower would then be erected on the old foundation. The Hooper Strait Light was slated to be so treated in 1966, but the newly founded Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum arranged with the Historical Society of Talbot County and the federal government to have the light moved to its campus instead. The light was sliced in half at its eaves, and the two pieces of the house were barged to St. Michaels, where they were reassembled on a newly constructed foundation on Navy Point. This was the first successful preservation effort of its kind in the bay, laying a precedent for the removal and preservation of the Drum Point and Seven Foot Knoll lights. The light remains a showpiece of the museum and a landmark on the St. Michaels waterfront.

Biography He was born in Bindersleben, near Erfurt, to David Adlung, an organist and his first teacher, and the former Dorothea Elisabetha Meuerin, from Tondorf. He attended the St. Andreas lower school in Erfurt from 1711, moving on to the Erfurt Gymnasium in 1713, during which time he lived in the household of Christian Reichardt, who also taught him organ. He studied philosophy, philology, and theology at the University of Jena from 1723 to 1726, where he studied the organ further with Johann Nikolaus Bach. At this time, he became friends with Johann Gottfried Walther in Weimar, and borrowed his works on music theory; he later wrote some books on the subject, most of which were destroyed, along with his house, in a fire in 1736. He returned to Erfurt in 1737 where he succeeded Johann Heinrich Buttstedt as organist of the Prediger church after the former's death, a post he retained for the rest of his life. He was also professor of languages at the Erfurt Gymnasium and taught, by his own estimate, 218 organ students and 284 language students between 1728 and 1762. He was also a maker of keyboard instruments, and completed sixteen of the same. He married Elisabeth Ritter in 1732, who was the daughter of the mayor of Gross-Wanzleben, near Magdeburg. Work He is one of a group of excellent scholar-musicians of the mid-18th century, along with Johann Mattheson, Lorenz Christoph Mizler, and Johann Gottfried Walther, who all wrote important and comprehensive studies of the theory, aesthetics, and practice of music; their works are rich and still partly untapped sources of information today, particularly about baroque music and performance practice. Anleitung zu der musikalischen Gelahrtheit records and collates all knowledge he could find about music history, mathematics in relation to music, temperament, more about the organ, other musical instruments, singing, thoroughbass, the chorale and chorale preludes, improvisation, Italian tablature, and composition. As a composer, he predominantly wrote pieces for organ.

K. Loring. It was the first volume in the six-volume Ragged Dick Series and became Alger's best-selling work. The tale follows a poor bootblack's rise to middle-class respectability in 19th-century New York City. It had a favorable reception. Student and Schoolmate reported their readers were delighted with the first installment, and Putnam's Magazine thought boys would love the novel. The plot and theme were repeated in Alger's subsequent novels and became the subject of parodies and satires. Ragged Dick and Alger's Silas Snobden's Office Boy inspired the musical comedy Shine! in 1982.  Plot  The text of Ragged Dick is based on the 1868 first book edition, annotated for student readers. \\"Contexts\\" begins by looking at Ragged Dick through the lenses of 1860s New York and Alger's own life there. Ragged Dick is a fourteen-year-old bootblack ‚Äì he smokes, drinks occasionally, and sleeps on the streets ‚Äì but he is anxious \\"to turn over a new leaf, and try to grow up 'spectable\\". He won't steal under any circumstances, and many gentlemen who are impressed with this virtue (and his determination to succeed) offer their aid. Mr. Greyson, for example, invites him to church and Mr. Whitney gives him five dollars for performing a service. Dick uses the money to open a bank account and to rent his first apartment. He fattens his bank account by practicing frugality and is tutored by his roommate Fosdick in the three R's. When Dick rescues a drowning child, the grateful father rewards him with a new suit and a job in his mercantile firm. With this final event, Richard is \\"cut off from the old vagabond life which he hoped never to resume\\" and henceforth will call himself Richard Hunter, Esq.  Major themes  A plate from an early edition depicting a \\"smasher\\" (luggage boy), a newsboy, and two bootblacks The Alger canon is described by Carl Bode of the University of Maryland as \\"bouncy little books for boys\\" that promote \\"the merits of honesty, hard work, and cheerfulness in adversity.\\" Alger \\"emblematized those qualities\\" in his heroes, he writes, and his tales are not so much about rags to riches \\"but, more sensibly, rags to respectability\\". With a moral thrust entrenched in the Protestant ethic, Alger novels emphasized that honesty, especially of the fiscal sort, was not only the best policy but the morally right policy, and alcohol and smoking were to be abjured. Alger knew he wasn't writing great literature, Bode explains, but he was providing boys with the sort of material they enjoyed reading: formulaic novels \\"whose aim was to teach young boys how to succeed by being good\\" and which featured \\"active and enterprising\\" boy heroes sustained by \\"an endearing sense of humor\\" even in the most trying of situations. Dialogue was \\"brisk\\" in the Alger novel and \\"when good disputed with evil, good always won.\\" Generally, a \\"malicious young snob\\" and a \\"middle-aged rascal\\" schemed to hurt the hero's rise, and a \\"mysterious stranger\\" and a \\"worldly but warmhearted patron\\" were at hand to ensure his success. Violence was kept at arm's length in the Alger novel, the tone remained \\"optimistic and positive\\", suspense was never \\"of the nail- biting sort\\", and the Alger universe was \\"basically benign\\". Bode points out that the problems of upward mobility in the Alger novel were never \\"insoluble\\", and, although luck was a major element in the Alger plot, it was never luck alone that brought the hero success but luck combined with \\"pluck\\".Alger 1985, pp. ix‚Äìxii. Gary Scharnhorst finds six major themes in Alger's 100-plus boys' books and considers that the major theme of Ragged Dick is a rise to respectability. Scharnhorst points out that Dick states he intends to change his way of life and \\"become 'spec-table\\". Early in the book, Mr. Whitney \\"replaces Dick's suit with a neat one, signaling the beginning of the transformation from Ragged Dick into Richard Hunter, Esq.\\" Scharnhorst follows Dick's progress through the tale to the moment when Dick is rewarded with a clerical position and notes that \\"The status of respectability, not a high salary, completes his transition from Ragged Dick to Richard Hunter.\\" Scharnhorst writes, \\"The recurrence in Alger's fiction of the theme of the Rise to Respectability underscores the inaccuracy of the widespread opinion that his heroes rise from rags to riches. Indeed, insofar as Alger's heroes prosper at all, they do so because they deserve prosperity, because they happily earn it with their virtue ... Alger's heroes always merit their good fortune‚Äîan idea which, like respectability, is associated only tangentially to wealth.\\"Scharnhorst 1980, pp. 75‚Äì76.  Development of the theme of the story  Alger had served as a Unitarian minister in Brewster, Massachusetts for about a year and a half when a church committee charged him with pederasty. He denied nothing, said that he had been imprudent, and resigned from the ministry, vowing never to accept another ministerial post. Church officials were satisfied, and no further action was taken. Alger relocated to New York City, where he cultivated a humanitarian's interest in the city's many vagrant children. A prolific author, he published to great success in Student and Schoolmate, a children's monthly magazine, and when its publisher asked him to develop a serial about street boys he wrote Ragged Dick, a tale about bootblacks. Bootblacks, circa 1870 New York City's bootblacks at the time Alger wrote Ragged Dick were boys, usually between the ages of ten and sixteen, \\"with any number of bad habits, and little or no principle\\".Martin 1868, pp. 264‚Äì265. They gambled, smoked cigar butts retrieved from the gutter, patronized Bowery theaters and concert halls, slept on the streets or in shelters supported by the charitable, and were \\"more proficient in profanity than the Water Street roughs\\".Crapsey 1872, p. 125. Alger told the Ladies Home Journal in 1890, \\"I had conversations with many street boys while writing 'Ragged Dick' ... and derived from many of them sketches of character and incidents\\". Alger adapted the conventions of the moral, sentimental, and adventure literature of the period to fashion the formula he would employ in writing Ragged Dick and the dozens of boys' books that followed it. \\"Alger did not invent his formula out of whole cloth,\\" Alan Trachtenberg wrote, \\"but boiled down the conventions to make a more refined brew: a style accessible both to young and adult readers; clever dialogue and vivid descriptions; a cast of characters who presented a range of moral positions; a physical setting itself a part of the action.\\"Alger 1990, pp. vii‚Äìxi. Trachtenberg points out that Alger almost certainly consulted New York City guidebooks and incorporated their advice on crooks, cheats, and conmen into his manuscript, and explains that Alger's series books and characters bear similarities to the anecdotal nature of myths, legends, and folktales: \\"Stories of gods and of larger-than-life persons like Paul Bunyan have an anecdotal quality similar to the sequence of encounters, adventures, confrontations, and coincidences that comprise the narratives of Ragged Dick and Tattered Tom and their kin among Alger's legion of boy heroes.\\"Alger 1990, p. xi. Ragged Dick has been described as a \\"puerile fantasy of the assimilation of the so-called dangerous classes to the bourgeois social order\\",Strickland 2002, p. 53. but Sacvan Bercovitch believes Alger created \\"a relatively realistic hero\\" in Dick‚Äîone who smokes, swears, plays pranks, and spends what money he has with abandon, yet one who displays an emotional depth foreign to Alger's subsequent heroes, who increasingly exhibited \\"the slow accretion of civilized instincts and habits, including proper speech, cleanliness, and courtesy\\" and who lacked Dick's \\"sense of humor, sadness, and critical intelligence\\".Bercovitch 2005, pp. 662‚Äì663.  Probable homoeroticism  Trachtenberg points out that Alger had tremendous sympathy for boys and discovered a calling for himself in the composition of boys' books: \\"He learned to consult the boy in himself,\\" Trachtenberg writes, \\"to transmute and recast himself‚Äîhis genteel culture, his liberal patrician sympathy for underdogs, his shaky economic status as an author, and not least, his dangerous erotic attraction to boy‚Äîinto his juvenile fiction.\\"Alger 1990, p. ix. He believes it impossible to know whether Alger lived the life of a secret homosexual, \\"[b]ut there are hints that the male companionship he describes as a refuge from the streets‚Äîthe cozy domestic arrangements between Dick and Fosdick, for example‚Äîmay also be an erotic relationship.\\" Trachtenberg observes that nothing prurient occurs in Ragged Dick but posits that \\"the few instances of boys touching each other tenderly or older men laying a light hand on the shoulder of boys, might arouse erotic wishes in readers prepared to entertain such fantasies.\\" Such images, Trachtenberg believes, may imply \\"a positive view of homoeroticism as an alternative way of life, of living by sympathy rather than aggression.\\" Trachtenberg concludes, \\"in Ragged Dick we see Alger plotting domestic romance, complete with a surrogate marriage of two homeless boys, as the setting for his formulaic metamorphosis of an outcast street boy into a self- respecting citizen.\\"Trachtenberg 1990, pp. ix‚Äìx.  Publication history  Ragged Dick was first published as a 12-part serial in Student and Schoolmate, beginning with January 1867 issue. Alger expanded the tale into a novel, which was published by A. K. Loring of Boston on May 5, 1868. Thousands of copies sold out within weeks, and the novel was republished in August 1868. It was the first in a six-volume Ragged Dick series. The book was Alger's best- selling work and remained in print for forty years.Scharnhorst 1985, pp. 81‚Äì87.  Literary significance and reception  Student and Schoolmate, August 1867 Student and Schoolmate reported in its February 1867 issue that the first installment of Ragged Dick \\"has created no little excitement among our numerous readers, as we supposed it would. Everybody is delighted.\\"Alger 2008, pp. 153‚Äì154. Scharnhorst observes that the Providence Evening Press, the Boston Transcript, The Christian Register, and the Monthly Religious Magazine praised the story, describing it as \\"simply charming\\", \\"excellent\\", and \\"spirited and inspiring\\". According to Scharnhorst, Booth Tarkington acknowledged the book as one of ten that made the \\"greatest impression on his life\\", and in 1947 \\"the Grolier Club of New York selected it as one of the hundred most influential American books published before 1900.\\"Scharnhorst 1985, pp. 86‚Äì87. Putnam's Magazine, in its issue of July 7, 1868, wrote that \\"Ragged Dick is a well-told story of street-life in New York, that will, we should judge, be well received by the boy-readers, for whom it is intended. The hero is a boot-black, who, by sharpness, industry, and honesty, makes his way in the world, and is, perhaps, somewhat more immaculate in character and manners that could naturally have been expected from his origin and training. We find in this, as in many books for boys, a certain monotony in the inculcation of the principle that honesty is the best policy, a proposition that, as far as mere temporal success is concerned, we believe to be only partially true. However, the book is very readable, and we should consider it a much more valuable addition to the Sunday-school library than the tales of Inebriates, and treatises on the nature of sin, that so often find place there.\\"Alger 2008, p. 156. Edwin P. Hoyt writes that \\"Ragged Dick ... caught the American fancy ... [It] represented something virtually unknown to boys in the American countryside and totally unsung until [its publication]: the street waif who made his living in the jungles of brick and stone\\". Hoyt points out the Alger refined the many \\"stylistic tricks\\" he had been polishing for several years. The action displayed an authorial confidence, and the language captured the \\"coarse and ungrammatical\\" style of the metropolitan street boys. The book was a virtual guide to Manhattan in 1866, and \\"for that reason if for no other it approached the realm of literature\\". Hoyt points out that \\"[T]here had never been such a book ... one swindle after another is exposed to readers who had never heard of such things.\\"Hoyt 1974, pp. 74-9 Scharnhorst indicates Alger's legacy resides not only in the several parodies and satires by William Dean Howells, Stephen Crane, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nathanael West, John Seelye, Glendon Swarthout, and William Gaddis, but also in the Horatio Alger Awards and in the many young readers who embraced his moral and humanitarian philosophy and were disinclined to embrace robber baron capitalism. Scharnhorst writes \\"It would seem that Alger was either over-rated as an economic and political propangandist or - more probably - his books were simply not designed thematically to spread the gospel of orthodox capitalism and convert the readership of The Masses.Scharnhorst 1985, pp. 144‚Äì146. In the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, the character Nucky Thompson gives the book to his nephew, saying that \\"he could learn a lot from it\\".  Adaptations  Ragged Dick and Alger's Silas Snobden's Office Boy inspired the 1982 musical comedy Shine! The show's librettist, Richard Seff, writes that the musical is an original based on Ragged Dick and Silas Snobden's Office Boy: \\"We've borrowed characters from both novels, youthened some, aged others, re-invented a few, created a few of our own. We stuck with Alger's pervasive theme: That in America one could begin with nothing, and with the right attitude, hard work, application and a little bit of luck, dream a dream and chart a course on which to achieve it.\\"Jones 2001. The Bowery Theatre, one of Ragged Dick's haunts before his reformation Eugene Paul reviewed a production mounted by the New York Musical Theatre Festival in 2010 and wrote that \\"Virtue ... is the message and the thrust of the show.\\" In his plot summary, Paul wrote that Ragged Dick is working his way slowly up the ladder of respectability when an opportunity to improve his prospects is offered him in Snobden's haberdashery. He faces a setback when his wicked stepfather, Luke, arrives on the scene. Dick avoids him and pursues his goals. \\"But everything comes crashing down when the darling son of a noble banker who has befriended Dick is kidnapped by none other than his stepfather, Luke. Suspicion and hatred, none of which Dick deserves, force him out of his job ... If you want to know how Dick overcomes these tribulations‚Äîbut then, you already know, don‚Äôt you. There is always a happy ending in Horatio Alger‚Äôs stories.\\"Paul 2010.

Williams had tapped a local acting class (The Actor's Gang) for his cast, and then he began the shooting along with working on several development issues with the story line with some of the actors. This would prove to be an ongoing issue for that the film for that it had no script.Abby Singer on REELot In 2002 Williams, Clint Palmer and the movie's lead actors went to Sundance Film Festival to work on several scenes. While there they came up with the idea to pose as volunteers during the awards ceremony so that they could include several A-list cameos. They were able to get cameo segments from: Roger Ebert, Stockard Channing, Mike Schank, Lloyd Kaufman, Mark Borchardt Between May 2002 - December 2002: Abby Singer was still in the process of being produced. Palmer, Williams and Jonathan M Black were working aggressively on the production of the film. It was thought that they needed to move to California, which they did that December. While in California Williams, Black, Palmer and Kamell Clauson were able to access the 2003 Golden Globes and to other various parties. It was at one of these parties where they meet the freelance writer, Tim Cooper, who was interested in \\"Operation Nighthawk\\", which took place in February 2003. The idea of Operation Nighthawk came when the filmmakers realized how they just could walk onto the Paramount lot with no problems. For the filmmakers, this became a great potential for marketing their film. After several months of reconnaissance, Black, Clauson, Williams and Palmer, along with writer Tim Cooper and a photographer, dropped off an Abby Singer press pack and a copy of the film trailer to all of the major studios and the executives of each studio.20th Century Foxed, Tim Cooper, UK Observer Magazine, Sept 21, 2003 Williams, Black, Palmer and Wendy Buss, were also able to be at the 2003 Independent Spirit Awards. Where they were able to have access to everything and everyone by using the same tactics has they had in the past, which was that they posed as volunteers. While there they filmed several more cameos. They successfully shot cameos with: Jill Hennessy, Jake Gyllenhaal, Don Cheadle, and Brad Pitt. Abby Singer made its film festival premier at the 2003 New Orleans Media Experience. The film won the two top awards: 'Best Independent Film' and 'Best Feature Film'. Still needing more marketing and public notice, Black and Clauson made their way to Salt Lake City, UT to organize another publicity stunt, 'Operation Altitude'. Operation Altitude was a publicity campaign at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. Over 1,500 people viewed Abby Singer in the course of the festival, through private screenings. In addition, the group put together a fake Comedy Central crew to build hype for the film and to encourage more people to see it. A documentary entitled, The Misbehavers,The Misbehavers Documentary listing on the IMDB directed by Bryan Young and Elias Pate, was filmed to cover the whole process.The Misbehavers documentary From October 2004 to 2005, the filmmakers were able to hunt down and gain access to their unsigned cameos. The celebrity releases were finally signed. Also, during this time, the film underwent a major revision and got a new soundtrack.Alternate version listed on the IMDB Between 2005 and 2006, Abby Singer again was submitted to and screened at several film festivals.IMDB listing of film festivals screenings for Abby Singer * Ain't Cool News: \\"Ezra reports that he was also inspired by the filmmakers' independent spirit and the film's \\"never give up\\" message.

Along with contemporary haridasa saints such as Gopala Dasa, Helevankatte Giriamma, Jagannatha Dasa and Prasanna Venkata Dasa, he propagated the virtues of the philosophy of Madhwacharya across South India through devotional songs called devaranama written in the Kannada language., p1 An integral part of Kannada Vaishnava devotional literature, these compositions in praise of the Hindu god Vishnu are called dasara padagalu (compositions of the dasas).Narasimhacharya (1988), p25 These compositions can be more specifically categorized as keertanas, suladis,ugabhogas, and simply padas. They were easy to sing to the accompaniment of a musical instrument and dealt with bhakti (devotion) and the virtues of a pious life. Early years Vijaya Dasa (Dasappa) was born in a poor Kannada Deshastha Brahmin family in Cheekalaparvi in Manvi taluk of Raichur district, Karnataka state. His parents were Srinivasappa and Kusamma. He left home at a young age due to poverty. Later he came back with some saints from north India to Cheekalaparvi and some how tried to manage his family but failed to overcome poverty. He went back to Varanasi where he became a scholar. One night, he had a dream in which the 16th century Carnatic composer and wandering saint Purandara Dasa initiated him into the Haridasa tradition and gave him the nom de plume (ankita nama) Vijaya Vittala and a Tamboori (Tanpur, musical instrument). From that day he was called Vijaya Dasa (dasa lit, slave to God), and dedicated his life to spreading Dvaita teachings. Compositions and ministry His 25,000 extant compositions earned him the title Dasa Shrestha (noble among the dasas). His compositions which use many Sanskrit words come under the category of Kalasha and Urasu creations and are considered an important component of Kannada literature (Kannada Sahitya)., p2 His purported miracles include calming the Ganges, entering it without getting wet, preventing a woman from committing suicide, resurrecting his son, and making an uneducated man speak difficult Sanskrit proficiently. He is among the group credited with starting the practice of singing devotional songs while walking up the Tirumala hills in modern Andhra Pradesh. These hills are the location of the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, an important pilgrim locations for Vaishnava Hindus., p2 References Bibliography  * R.

The group consists of younger musicians and performers who learn dances and music from elder experts and ethnologists. The group has toured internationally in North America, Europe, and Asia.Indigenous Arts . The troupe is Presbyterian. The Academia Sinica's Institute of Ethnology maintains a digital archive related to the troupe covering activities between 1991 and 1996, when Academia Sinica research fellow served as adviser to the group. A cofounding member of the company, Faidaw Fagod, served as the troupe's artistic director. History The Formosa Aboriginal Song and Dance Troupe was established in 1991 by Ko Li-mei. The group gathered in Kaohsiung. The troupe struggled to raise money and book performances. The dancers heard that Ko planned to sell the group, and chose to continue without her. After a few months of operation, the Council for Cultural Affairs agreed to subsidize the troupe with funds from the National Endowment for Culture and Arts. Troupe members traveled to Nanwang in Taitung City, and eventually convinced Puyuma elders to teach them tribal dances. They trained at Nanwang for one year. The dance company moved to Xindian City in Taipei County in 1992. From 2001, the dance company became a part of the Formosa Indigenous Dance Foundation of Culture and Arts. The foundation relocated to Hualien City in 2007. Performances The troupe's first performance following formal training took place at Taitung County Culture Center in 1992. That same year, the troupe was invited to perform at the Presidential Office Building during Double Ten Day celebrations. The troupe was awarded a medal at the 15th ceremony in November 1992. The troupe performed in New York in August 1993, marking their first international tour. Dancers later incorporated dances from other indigenous cultures in Taiwan. The troupe has won two Golden Melody Awards for traditional music, receiving the best singing performer award in 2006, followed by the award for best traditional album in 2011. The Formosa Aboriginal Song and Dance Troupe appeared at the 2006 Aboriginal Music Concert organized by the Taipei City Government, and have since performed at many festivals celebrating indigenous cultures, including the Global Indigenous Peoples Performing Arts Festival in 2011 and 2014. The troupe joined president Ma Ying-jeou on a diplomatic trip throughout Oceania in March 2010, and returned home to feature in the Taipei International Flora Exposition. During the exposition, the Formosa Aboriginal Song and Dance Troupe and Hugh Lee's Ping-Fong Acting Troupe co-produced The First Lily, the first Taiwanese musical to be adapted from a Rukai legend. In 2012, the Formosa Aboriginal Song and Dance Troupe was invited to perform at the inaugural Tainan Arts Festival. The troupe performed Maataw: the Floating Island at the National Theater in 2016. It was the first time that the Yami people had been featured in a performance within the theater. Maataw focused on the relationship between the Yami people and the government. Other performances by the Formosa Aboriginal Song and Dance Troupe also have political influences such as Dreaming of Azalea Mountain in 2011, about the death of Uyong â Yata'uyungana during the White Terror.

He was an early leader of the middle belt political movement in the 1940s. The movement among other things desired the creation of a separate state for inhabitants of the region. Early life David Lot was born in 1907 to the family of Daniel Lot, a Christian evangelist. He was raised in the Christian faith and attended a missionary primary school in his district of Panyam. From there, he was trained and mentored by missionaries in the district. In 1926, courtesy of Miss Webster, his mentor he went to St Bartholomew, Zaria, a missionary boarding school founded by Walter Miller. After completing his studies, he turned to the teaching profession as an early vocation.David Obadiah Vrengkat Lot, Nigeria, Church of Christ in Nigeria Career He started his teaching job at a small primary school in Panyam and got married later. In 1939, a need arose for a pastor from the Panyam district. David was nominated and sent to a training school for pastors in Gindiri and soon thereafter became an ordained minister. David Lot joined the political scene in the 1940s. He was interested in ways of improving the social and political lot of Christians in the middle belt region and to protect them from the dominant Islamic Hausa-Fulani group. In 1946, he was among a team of Nigerians who traveled to London to attend a constitutional conference. In 1950, he was a founding member and leader of the Middle Zone League (MZL) and a year later contested and won a seat to the House of Representative.

The League later merged with another middle belt party to form the United Middle Belt Congress Billy Joseph Dudley. Parties Parties and Politics in Northern Nigeria, Routledge, 1968. p 95.

Her hymns, well known in England and Ireland, were included in Lyra Sacra Hibernica, Ryle's Spiritual Songs, Lyra Britannica, and Times of Refreshing. Additionally, she wrote various religious pieces for periodicals. Early years Charitie Lees Smith was born on 21 June 1841, at Bloomfield, Merrion, County Dublin, the fourth child of Rev. George Sidney Smith and Charlotte Lees. The Rev. Smith was the minister of Colebrooke church, in the Church of Ireland parish of Aghalurcher from 1838‚Äì1867 and, during this period, the family lived in Ardunshin House near Brookeborough, County Fermanagh, Ireland. Her talent for poetic composition was developed at an early period of her life. Career In 1860, one of Smith's first compositions O for the robes of whiteness appeared in leaflet form in the immediate aftermath of the Irish 1859 revival. In 1863, she wrote perhaps her best known hymn \\"Before the Throne of God Above\\" which she entitled The Advocate (a hymn which was revived in evangelical circles in the late 20th century). In 1867, Smith's father took the family to Tattyreagh, Omagh, County Tyrone, when he became the rector of St Columba's Church. Smith continued with her compositions, publishing them in a volume entitled Within the Veil in 1867. She wrote considerably for several serial publications and contributed hymns to J. C. Ryle's Spiritual Songs, Times of Refreshing, and the Lyra Britannica (1866) of Charles Rogers. Her hymn, \\"Christ Mighty to Save,\\" was included in the latter publication, while \\"Heavenly Anticipations\\" was a favorite in Sunday schools. \\"Mighty to Save\\" first appeared in 1867 in the Lyra Britannica, its form being seven stanzas of eight lines each, but it was considerably abbreviated to fit it for common use, including a cento beginning with the third verse. \\"Aspirations\\" was written in the flush and fervor of coming \\"out of darkness into marvellous light\\" during the awakenings of 1859-60 in Ireland. Personal life In 1869, Smith married a Liverpudlian, Arthur Bancroft, in Edinburgh, Scotland. Records of her married life are scarce but it seems she was widowed twice. She died on 20 June 1923, in Oakland, California aged 82 bearing the surname de Cheney, or de Chenez.

Career Since 2009, Emek's work has been shown in galleries across the United States, in Berlin, London and Tokyo. He has painted album covers for Neil Young, Pearl Jam and singer/ songwriter Erykah Badu. His work for Badu included the art and packaging for New Amerykah in 2008, voted #12 of the Top 20 Album Covers of All Time by Virgin Media. Emek's unique visual style has graced music posters on a diverse musical spectrum, from blues legend B.B.

He was invited to exhibit at the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum \\"History of Rock Posters\\" exhibition in Cleveland, Ohio.

Shelley Leopold of LA Weekly wrote: \\"Emek helped usher back the popularity of rock poster art and perhaps reminded us of its cultural importance right on the heels of iTunes and the impending disappearance of 'the album cover.'\\" \\"It seemed most appropriate to the way I draw,\\" Emek said. \\"Collectors don't necessarily ask me for something from a particular band; they might ask for a big robot.\\" Career beginnings His first poster commission was in 1992 for a unity rally and concert after the Rodney King verdict on Martin Luther King Day in Los Angeles. The poster was part of a grassroots effort and benefit to acknowledge the acquittal of the Rodney King verdict, and also bring healing to the riots that followed. The image‚Äîa scratchboard visage of Martin Luther King Jr. rising above a concert crowd‚Äîwas stapled to the city's burnt-out buildings. It is speculated that no copies of this poster exist today. Emek's poster-making career accelerated in the late 1990s with art for alternative rock acts from Europe and North America, including Pearl Jam, Radiohead, Queens of the Stone Age, Tool, and Marilyn Manson. Some earlier works were painted acrylic art on canvas from which limited edition litho posters were made. One such example is the 1998 litho for the Beastie Boys Portland Rose Garden (2 August) and Oakland Coliseum (13, 14 September 1998) shows. Philanthropy Emek created a poster to promote the Music for Relief \\"Tsunami Benefit Gig\\" on February 18, 2005 at Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, CA, USA. His poster, along with performances by No Doubt, Linkin Park, Jay-Z, Ozzy Osbourne, Blink-182, Rob Zombie, The Crystal Method and Jurassic 5 helped to raise over one million dollars for UNICEF and Habitat for Humanity. Music for Relief's Brad Delson thanked Emek for his contribution, stating that the money raised would be used to fund \\"vital projects in South Asia, as part of the long-term effort to rebuild those areas\\" affected by the December 2004 disaster. Following the Tuesday, 12 January 2010 Haiti earthquake, Emek released a limited-edition, 7-color silkscreen print with hand-illustrated type that simply reads, \\"Haiti\\".

Traditional country boats are still popular and they provide low cost convenient transport in this extensive inland waterways. Approximately 150 types of boats still populate the floodplain, and they vary in design, size and construction materials. They would be either of Bainkata type or of flat bottom type. A bainkata type boat would have a golui fore and a spoon shaped hull whereas a flat bottom type would have neither. River and boat are central to traditional Bengali culture and they fascinated generations of Bengali artists and poets.

Traditionally, boats are made by carpenters who learned their skill through an apprenticeship. Seasoning of timber is important in boat making. Commonly used timber are from local woods Jarul (dipterocarpus turbinatus), sal (shorea robusta), sundari (heritiera fomes), and Burma teak (tectons grandis).  Preservation of Craftsmanship  While wooden boats are still frequently used in Bangladeshi country life, they are often mechanized and the intricate craftsmanship in making these boats is, for the most part, underutilized. Very few steps are being taken to preserve these techniques and among them is Friendship, whose cultural preservation sector is working with some of the last master craftsmen of wooden boats in recreating them, along with recording and researching the history and techniques of boat- making. In 2006, Runa Khan Marre of Friendship was awarded a Rolex Award for Enterprise for work in preserving traditional Bengali boat-building skills.http://www.rolexawards.com/profiles/associate_laureates/runa_khan_marre/photos__videos Image Gallery File:Balami Nouka.jpg|A miniature model of Balami Nouka File:Boats Cox.jpg|The moon boat is a traditional fishing boat of the Cox 's Bazar District (‡¶ï‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∏‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ú‡ßá‡¶≤‡¶æ) in southeastern Bangladesh end.

Unlike most incendiaries, which contained napalm or phosphorus, the 750 pound CBU-55 was fueled primarily by propane. Described as \\"the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal,\\"Spencer C. Tucker, Vietnam, UCL Press, 1999, p.185 the device was one of the more powerful conventional weapons designed for warfare. Design The device had three main compartments, with propane, a blend of other gases, perhaps chlorine triphospate, or another oxidizing agent, and an explosive. The CBU-55 had two variations. The CBU-55/B consisted of 3 BLU-73A/B fuel-air explosive sub- munitions in a SUU-49/B Tactical Munitions Dispenser, and the CBU-55A/B had 3 BLU-73A/B sub-munitions in a SUU-49A/B dispenser).SBU/SBK to SXU - Equipment Listing The SUU-49/B dispenser could be carried only by helicopters or low- speed aircraft, whereas the SUU-49A/B was redesigned with a strongback and folding tailfins, so that they could also be delivered by high-speed aircraft as well. History The first generation of the CBU-55 was used during the Vietnam War, but only in a test mode by US forces. In 1971, a team from the Air Force Weapons Center at Eglin Air Force Base brought test versions of the CBU-55 to Southeast Asia for testing on two lower speed attack aircraft, the A-37 and the A-1. In late 1971, the team worked with the 604th Special Operations Squadron A-37 pilots at Bien Hoa Air Base to fly a handful of combat test missions. In December of that year, that same team came to Nahkon Phanom Royal Thai Air Base (NKP) to do the same tests with the 1st Special Operation Squadron, flying the A-1. On Dec 2nd, 5th, and 8th, three two ship A-1 sorties were flown, carrying four each of the CBU-55. The NKP test project officer and flight lead for these three missions, Capt. Randy Jayne, helped the Eglin team write up the test results, which were overall not positive. The unusual deployment sequence for the three propane canisters, and the fact that they fell under small parachutes highly susceptible to significant wind drift, made deliver accuracy and aircraft survivability (when releasing low enough to minimize that wind drift) questionable. Also, the very high drag characteristics of the CBU-55 canister, with its flat back end, severely limited the A-1's ability to carry other bombs, rockets, and CBU, a further negative issue. In February/March 1972 US Navy Light Attack Squadron 4 (VAL-4) based at Can Tho delivered several sorties with the OV-10 Bronco, in support of US Army and ARVN joint operations north of the Mekong River. The ordnance was considered experimental, and teams of pathologists were flown to the drop sites to examine weapon effects on enemy remains. Although the Air Force chose, based on the Bien Hoa and NKP tests, not to deploy the weapon to the two combat units in-theater, an inventory of the canisters was kept. By April 21, 1975, South Vietnam had largely been conquered by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). Earlier in the month, a single CBU-55 had been flown to Bien Hoa. The senior US military officer in Vietnam, Major General Homer D. Smith, cleared the way for the Saigon government to use the weapon against the PAVN. An RVNAF C-130 transport plane circled Xuan Loc at , then dropped the bomb. The contents exploded in a fireball over a area. Experts estimated that 250 soldiers had been killed, primarily by the immediate depletion of oxygen rather than from burns. The CBU-55 was never used again in the war, and South Vietnam's government surrendered on April 30. A second generation of the CBU-55 (and CBU-72) fuel-air weapons entered the United States military arsenal after the Vietnam War, and were used by the United States in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm.CBU-72 / BLU-73/B Fuel/Air Explosive (FAE) - Dumb Bombs See also *List of cluster bombs References Category:Cluster bombs Category:Thermobaric weapons Category:Explosive weapons Category:Cold War aerial bombs of the United States ","title":"CBU-55"},{"id":"11757346","text":"CH3NO may refer to: * Formaldoxime * Formamide * Nitrosomethane * Oxaziridine ","title":"CH3NO"},{"id":"11757349","text":"Mycosphaerella rubi is a fungal plant pathogen.

The band are best remembered for their single \\"Vacuum Cleaner,\\" which has been included on several compilation albums over the years. History Tintern Abbey were formed by Don Smith after meeting David MacTavish at the Overseas Visitors Club in Earl's Court London. Smith brought John Dalton into the band after a meeting in the Cromwellian Club in South Kensington and Mactavish brought Stuart Mckay into the band after a meeting at the dole office. Smith left the band after the release of \\"Beeside\\"/\\"Vacuum Cleaner\\" and completing work on \\"Snowman\\". MacTavish was later a member of Big Bertha and Velvet Opera, the latter of which latter-day Tintern Abbey guitarist Paul Brett also later joined.Liner Notes, Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964-1969. Rhino Records, 2001. The band released only one 45rpm single on Deram Records, \\"Beeside\\"/\\"Vacuum Cleaner\\" (Deram 164), in December 1967. Produced by Jonathan Webber, the single failed to sell. At this point the proposed follow up was a song called \\"Snowman\\" which had reached mastering stage when Smith left the group. After Smith's leaving, Paul Brett joined as a guitarist. Also, organist Terry Goldberg, originally of the Mark Leeman Five joined to the band. \\"How Do I Feel Today\\"/\\"Do What You Must\\", was slated for an April 1968 release but never appeared. A full-length LP was allegedly meant to follow in August 1968, but the group had disbanded by then. Since the band's breakup, the single \\"Beeside\\"/\\"Vacuum Cleaner\\" has been highly sought after by collectors (selling at ¬£1000 plus) and has been hailed as one of the best examples of British psychedelia.Joynson, Vernon. The Tapestry of Delights:The Comprehensive Guide to British Music of the Beat, R&B;, Psychedelic and Progressive Eras, 1963-1976. Borderline Productions, 1998, p. 533.Strong, Martin C. The Great Psychedelic Discography. Canongate, 1997, p. 278. As such, the band has become something of a cult favorite. Among other places, \\"Vacuum Cleaner\\" was re-released on the Nuggets II compilation. A 7\\" vinyl EP was released by Paul Brett and John Dalton in 2006 of 4 of the band's 1968-era demo songs, including \\"How Do I Feel Today\\", as a benefit for Oxfam. These songs were recorded in 1968 at Tony Pike's studios in Putney, London, but never released until recently and they are the only copies of the original acetates. Paul Brett has a collection of songs from that era that he wrote for submission to the LP that never was, including a setting of Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\". Brett intends to record these songs and release them to the public. Dave MacTavish as a solo artist released 1 single \\"Ooh La La\\" b/w \\"Collie Girl\\" on the Young Blood label in 1973 according to the label dates (then in Germany under \\"Decca\\" - license - # DL 25564).

Life Shamar name was recorded in Namara inscription In AD 275, he led his troops to victory over Najran, Ma'rib (the Sabeans later reconquered their capital) and Hadhramaut. He succeeded in uniting much of Yemen, assuming the title \\"King of Saba and Dhu Raydan and Hadhramaut and Yamnat\\" (Yamnat may have been the name of the Southern part of Yemen). From his time forward the Himyarite kings were known as \\"Tubba kings\\", and praised for their courage and leadership in traditional Yemeni poetry. Shamar name was recorded in Namara inscription. Diplomacy Shammar Yahri'sh sent a delegation to the Arab tribe of al-Azd and Tanukh and to the Sassanid court in Ctesiphon, which led to an exchange of ambassadors. At about the same time, the Roman emperor Constantius II sent the missionary Theophilus to ask if churches could be built for Roman India traders in the Himyarite territory. Legacy In about 280 AD, Shammar Yuhar øish, residing at his capital ·∫íafƒÅr, united Yemen under his rule. Alt URL One hundred years later Abu Karib Asad, who was nicknamed \\"Asad al-Kamel\\" (the perfect one) fulfilled the highest aspirations of Shammar Yuharish. Under his leadership the old Sabaean Kingdom with Ma'rib as the capital was conquered and ceased to exist as an independent kingdom. The Axumites, who had become a strong power and had occupied the Tihamah and part of the highlands more than once, were driven back to Ethiopia. During his rule pre-Islamic Yemen probably reached its greatest expansion including southern parts of present Saudi Arabia and Oman as a whole.

National Center for Biotechnology Information. Accessed 11 April 2014. Symptoms Alternaria dianthi can infect healthy plants, and favors humid, warm environments. The multicolored circular spots can grow to infect entire plants, resulting in wilting or death. These spots tend to be smaller than one centimeter, but can be larger, especially around stems. The cankers formed by A. dianthi spread through the stomata of leaf cells, and generally lead to yellowing, wilting, and death of the leaves of infected plants.Nelson, P. E. 1960. A recent review of carnation diseases. Florist's Review. Life cycle Alternaria dianthi reproduces asexually, forming row-like spores off of hyphae. Spores are formed on blisters on the host as well as within the mycelium. The thin, globular spores are spread through water. Spore production and infection decreases over winter, and has been observed to be highest in rainy summer months.Chang, N. 1982. The Alternaria leaf-spot of Dianthus caryophyllus L. Journal of Plant Protection. The spores of A. dianthi germinate optimally around 24 ¬∞C (75 ¬∞F), and cannot germinate below 4 ¬∞C (40 ¬∞F) or above 32 ¬∞C (90 ¬∞F). The fungus has been cultured on simple media such as potato dextrose agar, and does not need Dianthus tissue to germinate. Spores come into contact with healthy leaf and stem tissue of Dianthus plants through wind, rain, and contact with infected tissue. The host plant must be wet or moist for spores to germinate. Moderate to high humidity is also a requirement, and one study found that spores would not germinate under 55% humidity. The life cycle takes about four days from germination to the production of new conidia. Spores produced by Alternaria species are black, and can persist on dead tissue, in soil, and on hard surfaces such as those found in greenhouses.Albajes, R. 1999. Integrated pest and disease management in greenhouse crops. Volume 14, pp 34-47. No observations of pathogens of Alternaria dianthi have been published. Impact Alternaria dianthia was first recorded in the scientific literature by F.L. Stevens and J.G. Hall in 1909, from florists in the United States.F. L. Stevens and J. G. Hall. 1909. Carnation alternariose. Botanical Gazette, Vol. 47, No. 5, pp. 409-413. The fungus, along with other members of the genus Alternaria, is effectively controlled by the commercial fungicide mancozeb, as well as dithiocarbamtes, chlorotholonil, and iprodione. Although A. dianthi has been found in wild and commercial varieties of Dianthus plants worldwide, no studies of the economic impacts or losses due to the disease have been published.
