History The Act designed to bring the colonies in British North America closer together had the unintended effect of ensuring that a significant distance would always exist between them. The guarantee to leave several essential elements of governance ‚Äì most notably education and health care ‚Äì in the hands of the provinces created the conditions for a sense of disconnect, if not disunity. The teacher associations recognized an opportunity to create an organization that could bridge that gap and connect colleagues across the country. It took nearly 25 years for the perceived barriers to be cleared and for the Dominion Education Association ‚Äì later to become the Canadian Education Association ‚Äì to be launched in 1891.https://www.edcan.ca/history/ Publications  Education Canada Magazine  The print and online versions of Education Canada Magazine provide current and relevant articles that examine the latest policy and practice issues that are trending in provincial education systems and affect us all.

The Instrument is a codified set of rules and guidelines for reporting and displaying information related to mineral properties owned by, or explored by, companies which report these results on stock exchanges within Canada. This includes foreign-owned mining entities who trade on stock exchanges overseen by the Canadian Securities Administrators, even if they only trade on Over The Counter (OTC) derivatives or other instrumented securities. Many publicly held Canadian mineral exploration and mining companies list on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) or the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Some of these companies may also have listings on stock exchanges outside Canada, such as Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Australian Securities Exchange and London Stock Exchange. Disclosures covered by the NI 43-101 code include press releases of mineral exploration reports, reporting of resources and reserves, presentations, oral comments, and websites. The NI 43-101 covers metalliferous, precious metals and solid energy commodities as well as bulk minerals, dimension stone, precious stones and mineral sands commodities. The National Instrument 43-101 is broadly comparable to the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC Code) which regulates the publication of mineral exploration reports on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). It is also broadly comparable with the South African Code for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (SAMREC).http://www.samcode.co.za Samcodes The reporting codes are, however, not entirely congruent in practice, in that NI 43-101 is more prescriptive in terms of the manner in which mineral exploration reporting is presented, although the content of the technical reports, and the scientific rigors to which the mineral resource classifications within them are put, are often very similar. For TSX listing purposes, an NI 43-101 Technical Report would have to be accompanied by a Report prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. For ASX listings, a JORC Mineral Resource Statement needs to be accompanied by a Valmin Valuation Report, while for JSE listings, a Competent Person's Report (CPRs), which is compliant with SAMREC and The South African Code for the Valuation of Mineral Assets (SAMVAL), needs to be submitted. In many cases, NI 43-101 and JORC Code technical reports are considered inter-changeable and may be accepted by either regulatory body in cases of dual listed entities and, indeed, are accepted as the de facto industry reporting standard by many other jurisdictions which lack similar rigorous reporting standards or internationally recognized industry professional bodies. The LSE, for instance, accepts CPRs, Qualified Person's Reports (QPRs), and Mineral Resource Statements, compiled using JORC, SAMREC and SAMVAL, or NI 43-101, when accompanied by a NI51-101 Valuation Form, for listing on the LSE. Likewise, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange accepts reports prepared in accordance with NI 43-101,SAMREC or JORC. Purpose The purpose of National Instrument 43-101 is to ensure that misleading, erroneous or fraudulent information relating to mineral properties is not published and promoted to investors on the stock exchanges overseen by the Canadian Securities Authority. The NI 43-101 was created after the Bre-X scandal to protect investors from unsubstantiated mineral project disclosures. \\"The gold reserves at (Bre-X's) Busang were alleged to be 200 million ounces (6,200 t), or up to 8% of the entire world's gold reserves at that time. However, it was a massive fraud and there was no gold. The core samples had been faked by salting them with outside gold. An independent lab later claimed that the faking had been poorly done, including the use of shavings from gold jewelry. In 1997, Bre-X collapsed and its shares became worthless in one of the biggest stock scandals in Canadian history.\\" The promulgation of a codified reporting scheme makes it more difficult for fraud to occur and reassures investors that the projects have been assessed in a scientific and professional manner. However, even properly and professionally investigated mineral deposits are not necessarily economic, nor does the presence of a NI 43-101-, JORC- or SAMREC and SAMVAL- compliant CPR or QPR necessarily mean that it is a good investment. Similarly, the publication of a complex technical report with all the inherent jargon, technical wording and abstract geological, metallurgical and economic information may not actually significantly advantage an investor who is not able to fully nor properly understand the content or importance of this information. In this way the NI 43-101 may not serve the interests of those it is designed to protect‚Äî the retail investors who may easily misinterpret such information. Because of this, many investors hire independent geology consultants to review the reports for them. Stipulations NI 43-101 stipulates and codifies the form and content of a compliant report (i.e.; a report that complies with the Reporting Standard). Prescribed disclosure within the National Instrument relates to; * All disclosure of scientific or technical information, including disclosure of a mineral resource or mineral reserve, concerning a mineral project on a property material to the issuer must be based upon information prepared by or under the supervision of a qualified person * What the National Instrument is to be used for, such as which types of mineral properties must be covered by a compliant report * Prescribes the terminology to be used to describe various features, both geologically and financially, within the report * Stipulates the type of information to be discussed and the technical data which must be portrayed, for various levels of reporting * Prescribes a list of approved Competent Persons, and the definition of Groups and Associations which may qualify to certify such a person as \\"Qualified\\" * Prescribes that a Qualified Person vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the contained information and the manner in which it is presented * Provides guidance on reporting Historical mineral resource estimates Proscribed disclosure within the National Instrument precludes a company from reporting; * Quantity, grade, or metal or mineral content of a deposit that has not been categorized as an inferred mineral resource, an indicated mineral resource, a measured mineral resource, a probable mineral reserve or a proven mineral reserve * Results of an economic analysis that includes inferred mineral resources ** Allows for the potential grade, quantity and metal or mineral content of an exploration property, provided that a qualifying statement is made as to this being conceptual in nature * The term preliminary feasibility study, pre-feasibility study or feasibility study when referring to a study unless the study satisfies the criteria set out in the National Instrument Comparison with the JORC Code The National Instrument 43-101 requires substantially more technical disclosure to the market than the equivalent JORC Code, because the JORC Code is primarily a code for reporting the status of a mineral resource, whereas the NI 43-101 is a code of securities disclosure. This distinction is based on the derivation of the two codes: the JORC Code is derived from the Joint Ore Reserves Committee, an independent mineral industry body formed from industry professional associations; The NI 43-101 is a code derived from the Canadian Securities Authorities. The JORC Code, were it equal with the NI 43-101 would be derived from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, not the relevant industry bodies. The technical information required in a Reserve declaration under the NI 43-101 exceeds that within the JORC Code, primarily by stipulating that certain geological parameters of the mineral reserve must be presented within a report, published in full, and presented in a particular way. Conversely, JORC Compliant technical reports are not commonly published in full upon the Australian Stock Exchange as this is not required by Australian regulatory authorities. Therefore, often a summary of the key points is published, which can often preserve commercially sensitive information, and often this could allow deleterious information to remain out of the public forum. Qualified Persons Statement The instrument requires that a \\"qualified person\\" be attributed to the information. This Qualified Person, in the spirit of the National Instrument, is required to be a reputable professional who is knowledgeable of the mineral property concerned, and who has sufficient experience and qualifications to make the statements which are made within the report. Often the Qualified Person need not be the author of the report, but in attributing the report as being compliant with the National Instrument, they are vouching for it. This is a matter of professional integrity and carries legal risk, as misleading statements can result in legal sanctions in Canadian and other jurisdictions. A qualified person is defined in the National Instrument as: * is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration, mine development or operation or mineral project assessment, or any combination of these; * has experience relevant to the subject matter of the mineral project and the technical report; and * is in good standing with a professional association and, in the case of a foreign association, is of recognised stature within that Organisation. The requirement for a Qualified Person in the NI 43-101 is different from that required by the JORC Code, and the SAMREC and SAMVAL Codes, wherein the person must have 5 years experience relevant to the deposit type or style of mineralization but is otherwise similar in terms of who may or may not sign off on such a document. The Qualified Person must declare whether a qualified person has verified the data disclosed, including sampling, analytical and test data underlying the information or opinions contained in the written disclosure; a description of how the data was verified and any limitations on the verification process; and an explanation of any failure to verify the data.

Puerto Villamil was founded in 1897 by Antonio Gilhttps://www.ecostravel.com/ecuador/ciudades- destinos/puerto-villamil-isabela.php Traditionally residents of Puerto Villamil have earned a living either through agriculture or fishing. Over the years the government has made policies to move the population away from fishing and into tourist-based activities. This move has been hotly debated, and has created political incidents including one in 2000 when a group of sea cucumber fishermen kidnapped baby tortoises in order to have the government extend their fishing limits. The modern church Iglesia Cristo Salvador in the middle of town is worth a visit because of its colourful wall paintings depicting various typical animals and landscapes of the island. The municipal market with a large relief on the wall showing birds of the island is close by. On the southwestern edge of town a boardwalk was created by the park with assistance of US Aid. It leads through mangrove environments passing along saltwater lagoons filled with flamingo, common stilts, whimbrels, Bahama pintails, and gallinules that come here to sweep the mud in search of brine. At the end of the walkway is the Tortoise Breeding Center (Centro de Crianza de Tortugas Terrestres) which was built in order to help preserve the many species of Isabela Tortoises.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles, and is one of the Earth's most important economic sectors by revenue. The first practical automobile with a petrol engine was built by Karl Benz in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany.  United Kingdom  In 1984 British Leyland sold its Jaguar car business into private ownership. British Leyland's mass-market car division, the Austin Rover Group, scrapped one of its longest-running marques, Morris, which was discontinued in August after the Ital was replaced by the new Austin Montego ‚Äì a saloon version of the previous year's new Maestro hatchback. The new Montego went on sale in April and is powered by 1.3 and 1.6 petrol engines, with more versions set to follow, including high performance MG variants. October of this year saw the Triumph marque canned, when the Acclaim saloon finished production to be replaced by the Rover 200 Series in June, a four-door saloon which competes in the same sector as the Austin Maestro. Its 1.3 engine is sourced from the Honda Civic, while the 1.6 power unit is supplied from the Austin Rover parts bin. The 200 Series is made at Cowley, where it will soon be joined by the next generation Honda Ballade. The venture with Honda is set to include a replacement for the Rover SD1, with the new model scheduled for launch in two years' time. The Metro was given a facelift in October and offered a 5-door model for the first time. Ford had a relatively low profile year in 1984, with the only major changes to the range being the addition of the Escort RS Turbo (powered by a turbocharged XR3i 1.6 engine) and the discontinuation of the unpopular three-door Sierra. A replacement for the Granada range is due next year. Production of the Capri for the European market ended in November but RHD production for the UK would continue for another 2 years. Vauxhall scored a huge success in 1984 by launching the second incarnation of the Vauxhall Astra in October. The new model, like its predecessor, is a range of three and five-door medium-sized hatchbacks and estates. Engines range from a slow but economical 1.2 to a swift 2.0 ‚Äì the GTE ‚Äì which can top 120 mph. There is also a fuel efficient 1.6 diesel. A more powerful version of the GTE is planned for the near future, as are cabriolet and saloon bodystyles. The Astra, which is still sold as the Opel Kadett on the continent, was voted European Car of the Year for the 1985 model year. After 9 years on sale and having already been replaced by the Nova in April 1983, the Chevette ends production in January with sales continuing for a while afterwards.  France  The big news for Renault in 1984 was the launch of a new competitor in the Granada/Audi 100 sector ‚Äì the R25 in March. Renault's all-new executive hatchback offers class- leading levels of ride quality, comfort, space and equipment. The smaller- engined petrol and diesel units offered impressive refinement, with more powerful and high-performing variants expected later. The new R25 is officially the most aerodynamic car in the world, giving it excellent ride and handling to match even the most prestigious of its rivals from the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Renault's other big launch of 1984 is Europe's first MPV, the Espace, originally meant to be launched as a Talbot but became a Renault instead. At launch in July only 9 of them were sold but it eventually became popular with buyers across Europe while UK sales started in August 1985. The ageing Chrysler-designed Alpine and Solara hatchback and saloon ranges (which were launched nine years ago) were given a mild makeover at the end of 1984 and given new names. Instead of being named by bodystyle, the new versions of this long-running car were badged by trim. The standard models now wear \\"Minx\\" nameplates, harking back to one of the Rootes Group's most historic names. The sportier, better-equipped variants are now badged \\"Rapier\\" ‚Äì taking their name from a memorable sports car of the Rootes Group's later years. This is seen as a last-ditch attempt by owners Peugeot to draw customers to these outdated models before any possible replacements are in the pipeline.  Italy  Six years after the launch of the Ritmo/Strada hatchbacks, Fiat have finally launched a saloon version. The Regata, as it will be known, is similarly engineered and priced to the hatchback from which it spawned, but is comparable in size to cars in the next highest sector. This makes it exceptionally good value, a unique selling point which is the key factor behind its TV advertising campaign. There is also an estate version of the Regata ‚Äì the \\"Weekend\\" ‚Äì which is one of the most capacious load carriers of its size. Production of the Lancia Beta has finally ceased after 12 years. Following the launch of newer models like the Delta and Prisma, demand for this once-iconic Italian sedan has gradually slumped and the makers decided that it was time to pull the plug on the production line. In the pipeline for 1985 are new Lancia-badged cars for the supermini and executive car sectors, giving the marque another chance of reestablishing itself in the many markets where it has endured a fall in popularity due to the rust problems of earlier models.  Germany  Opel would launch what would be the final generation of the long-running Kadett small-family car range in August with a choice of 3 and 5-door hatchbacks and estates and featured a more aerodynamic design. It would also be sold as the Vauxhall Astra in the UK and as the Daewoo LeMans in Korea from 1986. Both Opel and Vauxhall versions would win the European Car Of The Year award for 1985.  Eastern Europe  Lada has finally made a departure from the veteran Fiat 124-based Lada Riva of 1966 vintage. Though the older car is to continue, the new Samara is a superb engineering achievement after 15 years with virtually no technical changes at Togliatti. The new car, a front-wheel drive hatchback with a choice of three or five doors, uses a completely fresh mechanical design which includes 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5 petrol engines. The car has already gone on sale in the USSR, but its Western European debut is unlikely to occur for at least another year or two.  Japan  Nissan has made further progress with its fast range of \\"Z-Cars\\", though the latest designs have not received the praise that their ancestors did. The current Z-Car is the 300ZX, the successor to the less powerful 280ZX. It is powered by a 3.0 V6 engine that gives strong performance well in excess of 130 mph, making it a real competitor for the likes of the Toyota Supra and Mazda RX-7. But many enthusiasts still loyal to the 240Z of old have yet to accept it as a true successor to those classic old-timers. Honda is achieving sales success in Asia and Europe with the new, latest version of its Prelude coupe. Its 2.0 16-valve engine gives strong performance, while the pop-up headlights allow for a more aerodynamic front end which gives way to reduced drag. There is also a 1.8 12-valve power unit with a carburettor, which lacks the larger-engined version's impressive performance but is still a good drive and is more competitively-priced.

Optical turnstiles are usually a part of an access control system, which also consists of software, card readers, and controllers. Optical turnstiles operate much like regular mechanical turnstiles, except that they rely primarily on electronic (infrared) beams, and audible/visual interfaces to control entry. Rather than physically restraining a person, the optical turnstile uses sounds and lights to alert others to attempted entry by unauthorized individuals. The advent of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) drove optical turnstile development because physical barriers for access were no longer legal for public access due to the fact that persons in wheelchairs or with other disabilities could not use them as access points. For this reason, they are not likely to be used in subways and stadiums, as they are suited for settings where design and aesthetics are important, such as lobbies. They are perfect for high rise buildings with a single path through the lobby and staffed reception. The rate of people passing through the optical turnstile is high, with less delay than other methods. They are also suitable for the handicapped, as they are barrier-free. Early optical turnstiles used centralized programmable logic controllers i.e. a single processor for each installation location. Later individual controllers, one per lane, were employed. Some of the first North American optical turnstiles were developed in the late 1980s for the San Francisco market by Omega Corporate Security of Walnut Creek, California. Early installations included Charles Schwab, East Bay Municipal Utility District, and Wells Fargo. In parallel, Automatic Systems and others developed barrier type optical turnstiles (speedgates) for the mass transit industry that were eventually adapted and evolved for Class A commercial real estate and corporate HQ entrance control markets. Today there are many manufacturers, based in North America, Europe, China and around the world. The optical turnstile products have evolved with technological advances over time. Many security entrance lanes today are optical turnstile portals employing moving, mobile barriers of metal, glass or acrylic in some cases. The barriers can be drop arms, swinging glass, retractable (sliding) glass, or other materials. The sensing technology has improved to a higher level of security violation detection, as well as to allow for faster throughput. Longer cabinets are sometimes used to increase throughput. Trolley detection is employed to discern between tailgate/piggybackers and roller bags and luggage. Many security optical turnstiles are IP network ready, and certified for mechanical and electrical safety via UL325 or UL2593 standards by nationally recognized testing labs. Newest technological offerings in optical turnstiles include climb over detection software, biometrics and QR code reader integrations inside the cabinet, and built-in elevator destination dispatch screens often at 45 degree angle. Manufacturers can state their product reliability in terms of MCBF (Mean Cycles Between Failure) or in terms of warranties - usually between 1 and 5 years. Slimlane swing glass optical turnstile with bar code readers and elevator destination dispatch screens Following the global COVID-19 crisis, new hygiene oriented credentialing integrations became the focus for pedestrian entrance control manufacturers. Card readers and even some (fingerprint) biometric devices that require contact are expected to be largely replaced by contactless facial recognition, palm geometery, iris scan, and advanced handwave readers. Smartphone credentials that use wifi, cellular, and bluetooth technology are gaining interest for this purpose as well. Besides the obvious hygiene benefits of such new credentialing, security is also enhanced in the biometric case by the inability for biometrics to be stolen or shared between individuals.

Looking south from 37th Street, west of Park Avenue. Mary Lindley Murray is known in American Revolutionary folklore as the Quaker woman who in 1776 held up British General William Howe after the British victory against American forces at Kips Bay. According to James Thatcher, a surgeon travelling with Washington's army, Murray treated Howe and his generals to cake and wine and delayed them several hours as the American rebels got away safely and undetected. As Thatcher puts it: > When retreating from New York, Major General Putnam, at the head of three > thousand five hundred continental troops, was in the rear and the last that > left the city. In order to avoid any of the enemy that might be advancing in > the direct road to the city, he made choice of a road parallel with and > contiguous to the North River, till he could arrive at a certain angle, > whence another road would conduct him in such a direction as that he might > form a junction with our army. It so happened that a body of about eight > thousand British and Hessians were at the same moment advancing on the road, > which would have brought them in immediate contact with General Putnam, > before he could have reached the turn into the other road. Most fortunately, > the British generals, seeing no prospect of engaging our troops, halted > their own, and repaired to the house of a Mr. Robert Murray, a Quaker and > friend of our cause; Mrs. Murray treated them with cake and wine, and they > were induced to tarry two hours or more, Governor Tryon frequently joking > her about her American friends. By this happy incident General Putnam, by > continuing his march, escaped a rencounter with a greatly superior force, > which must have proved fatal to his whole party. One half hour, it is said, > would have been sufficient for the enemy to have secured the road at the > turn, and entirely cut off General Putnam s retreat. It has since become > almost a common saying among our officers, that Mrs. Murray saved this part > of the American army.

He was named British Designer of the Year in 1988 and 1992. Biography Ozbek was born in Istanbul, Turkey and grew up in a yali on the Bosphorus. He moved to London in the 1970s and lived in his parents' flat in Belgravia whilst he was studying architecture and then fashion at Saint Martin's School of Art. After graduating in 1977 (or 1978), Ozbek went to Italy where he designed clothes for Monsoon. In 1984 he established his own company, then began to show his yearly collections in Milan and New York City, and more recently, in Paris. In 1987 the production of his studio line, Future Ozbek, was licensed to Aeffe SpA, in Italy, and his notoriety continued to grow. By 1995, he had launched his own perfume called \\"Ozbek\\", and later a second, \\"Ozbek 1001\\". The fall 1999/spring 2000 collections of many designers reflected the very aesthetic that Ozbek valued for over a decade‚Äîthe artful mixing of unlikely patterns, shapes, and ornamentation, along with bits and pieces borrowed from a global grab bag. In 2010, Ozbek launched a new business called \\"Yastik\\", which means \\"pillow\\" in Turkish, and opened his first London store. √ñzbek was an interior designer for Robin Birley's new nightclub, 5 Hertford Street, which opened in 2012. He lives between London, Istanbul and Bodrum, where he resides with his partner Erdal Karaman. Style Ozbek is inspired by adornment. He is an observer of culture and subculture, from Tibetan to American Indian, and his interest in decoration is evident in his ornamental clothing. He gained notoriety by combining the decorative symbols and shapes of diverse cultures, such as the Far East, Africa, and his native Turkey, with the classic silhouettes of the West. Ozbek created eclectic clothing which encouraged the urban consumer to embrace \\"ethnic chic\\". His use of embroidery, tassels, and vivid colors like turquoise and fuchsia was completely at odds with 1980s power dressing; nevertheless, his antifashion approach to modern dressing received quite a bit of attention from those who appreciated the departure from sharp-edged suiting. Ozbek's designs reflected both club scene and New Age influences, when in 1990, he made clear his faith in spiritualism by presenting an all-white collection. His popularity continued throughout the 1990s as he continued his investigation of culture and subculture, taking street fashion to the runway with the addition of baseball caps covered with sequins.

While the exact parentage of the grape is unknown, the most popular theories has it as a cross of two Seibel grapes, Seibel 867 x Seibel 2524 with another theory speculating that Plantet's parentage was Seibel 4461 crossed with Berlandieri-Jacquez. J. Robinson Vines Grapes & Wines pg 199 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Plantet is grown primarily in the Loire Valley around Anjou and is known for its prolific yields that the vine can produce. The vine is generally reliable and disease resistant, producing well even after suffering through a spring frost, however the berries tend to be difficult to crush which, along with the uprooting of hybrid varieties throughout France, has contributed to the varieties decline in the later half of the 20th century. History Developed by grape breeder Albert Seibel in the late 19th century, Plantet's exact parentage in unknown though it very likely has at least one Seibel grape as a parent. For most of the 20th century, the variety was the most widely planted hybrid in the Loire Valley. Throughout France, the variety hit its peak in 1968 with more than 64,000 acres (26,000 hectares), almost exclusive to the Loire Valley and other scattered northern French wine regions.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 147 Oxford University Press 1996 However, the later half of the 20th century saw Plantet caught up in the same disfavor that befell all hybrid grapes in France (most notably Villard noir, Baco noir and others). Aggressive vine pull schemes that included lucrative payments to growers for uprooting their vineyards and prohibition of using hybrid grapes in Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wines contributed to a sharp decline for the grape variety. By the end of the 1980s there was less than 1,000 hectares of the grape throughout France. Viticulture Plantet was likely bred by Seibel to be a winter-hardy variety and to some extent it is. Growers in the Loire and many northern French wine regions found that the grape still produced high yields despite severe winters and late spring frost when many other varieties, particularly those of Vitis vinifera would be severely damaged. But there is limit to this benefit with the cold making the berries more difficult to crush and the variety not performing well in regions such as New York State after their harsh winters.

It is a simplified spirometer provided to patients who have had any surgery that might jeopardize respiratory function, particularly surgery to the lungs, but also commonly to patients recovering from cardiac or other surgery involving extended time under anesthesia and prolonged in-bed recovery. The incentive spirometer also is issued to patients recovering from pneumonia or rib damage to help minimize the chance of fluid build-up in the lungs. It may be used as well by wind instrument players, who want to improve their air flow. Using the mouth piece, the patient breathes in from the device as slowly and as deeply as possible, then holds that breath in for 2‚Äì6 seconds. This provides back pressure that pops open alveoli. It has the same effect as that which occurs during yawning. An indicator driven by the patient's breathing provides a gauge of how well the patient's lungs (or lung if singular) are functioning, by indicating sustained inhalation vacuum. Generally, patients are encouraged to do many repetitions a day while measuring progress by way of advancing the movable gauge along the central column of the device as they improve.

A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the acceptance by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht‚Äîthe Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)‚Äîas well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD‚ÄîReich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 foreign recipients of the award.Fellgiebel 2000, pp. 113‚Äì460, 483, 485‚Äì487, 492, 494, 498‚Äì499, 501, 503, 509.

Listed here are the 104 Knight's Cross recipients whose last name starts in the range of \\"X\\" to \\"Z\\".Fellgiebel 2000, pp. 455‚Äì460. Veit Scherzer has challenged the validity of 2 of these listings.Scherzer 2007, p. 186. The recipients are ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded. Background The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (), the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (). Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (), was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords () and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (). At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (), based on the enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized. Recipients The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists for the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade.Fellgiebel 2000, p. 112. Of the 104 awards made to servicemen whose last name starts in the range of \\"X\\" to \\"Z\\", only Wolf-Dietrich Ritter und Edler von Xylanders last name starts with \\"X\\". Of these 104 recipients, eleven were later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and one the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords; seven presentations were made posthumously.

Informal learning is any learning that is not formal learning or non-formal learning, such as self-directed learning or learning from experience. Informal learning is organized differently than formal and non-formal learning because it has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner's standpoint. For all learners this includes heuristic language building, socialization, enculturation, and play. Informal learning is a pervasive ongoing phenomenon of learning via participation or learning via knowledge creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning via knowledge acquisition. The term is often conflated, however, with non-formal learning, and self-directed learning. It is widely used in the context of corporate training and education in relation to return on investment (ROI), or return on learning (ROL). It is also widely used when referring to science education, in relation to citizen science, or informal science education. The conflated meaning of informal and non-formal learning explicates mechanisms of learning that organically occur outside the realm of traditional instructor-led programs, e.g., reading self-selected books, participating in self-study programs, navigating performance support materials and systems, incidental skills practice, receptivity of coaching or mentoring, seeking advice from peers, or participation in communities of practice, to name a few. Informal learning is common in communities where individuals have opportunities to observe and participate in social activities. Characterizations Open House Day at ESO‚Äôs Headquarters. Informal learning can be characterized as the following: * It usually takes place outside educational establishments; * It does not follow a specified curriculum and is not often professionally organized but rather originates accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing practical requirements; * It is not necessarily planned pedagogically, systematically according to fixed subjects, test and qualification-oriented, but rather, either unconsciously incidental or consciously intended intuition, holistically problem-related, and related to actual situations and fitness for life; * It is experienced directly in its \\"natural\\" function of everyday life. * It is often spontaneous and creative. * It is a key component to an alternative learning system coined, Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI), which is based on the learning methods observed to be common in many Indigenous American communities. History The origin of informal learning has been traced back to John Dewey through his theories about learning from experience. The term was later introduced by Malcolm Knowles when he published his work, Informal Adult Education in 1950. At first, informal learning was only delimited from formal school learning and nonformal learning in courses (Coombs/Achmed 1974). Marsick and Watkins take up this approach and go one step further in their definition. They, too, begin with the organizational form of learning and call those learning processes informal which are non- formal or not formally organized and are not financed by institutions (Watkins/Marsick, p. 12 et sec.). An example for a wider approach is Livingstone's definition which is oriented towards autodidactic and self- directed learning and places special emphasis on the self-definition of the learning process by the learner (Livingstone 1999, p. 68 et seq.). Livingstone explained that explicit informal learning is distinguished from tacit informal learning and socialization in the sense that the individual seeks learning in this setting and creates the conditions for it by putting himself in situations or engaging with others so that learning is possible. Differences between informal and non-formal learning As noted above, informal learning is often confused with non-formal learning. Non-formal learning has been used to often describe organized learning outside of the formal education system, either being short-term, voluntary, and having, few if any, prerequisites. However they typically have a curriculum and often a facilitator. As stated on the non-formal learning page, non-formal learning can be seen in various structured learning situations, such as swimming lessons, community-based sports programs and conference style seminars. Other perspective Merriam et al. (2007) state: \\"Informal learning, Schugurensky (2000) suggests, has its own internal forms that are important to distinguish in studying the phenomenon. He proposes three forms: self-directed learning, incidental learning, and socialization, or tacit learning. These differ among themselves in terms of intentionality and awareness at the time of the learning experience. Self-directed learning, for example, is intentional and conscious; incidental learning, which Marsick and Watkins (1990) describe as an accidental by-product of doing something else, is unintentional but after the experience she or he becomes aware that some learning has taken place; and finally, socialization or tacit learning is neither intentional nor conscious (although we can become aware of this learning later through 'retrospective recognition') (Marsick & Watkins, 1990, p. 6)\\" (p. 36). More recently, Bennett (2012) extended Schugurenksky's (2000) conceptualization of informal by recommending four modes of informal learning: a) self-directed, which is conscious and intentional, b) incidental, which is conscious and unintentional, c) tacit, which replaces socialization and is both nonconscious and unintentional, and d) integrative, which is nonconscious and intentional. Drawing upon implicit processing literature, she further defined integrative learning as \\"a learning process that combines intentional nonconscious processing of tacit knowledge with conscious access to learning products and mental images\\" (Bennett, 2012, p. 4) and she theorized two possible sub- processes: knowledge shifting and knowledge sublimation, which describe limited access learners have to tacit knowledge. In American Indigenous communities People in many Indigenous communities of the Americas often learn through observation and participation in everyday life of their respective communities and families. Barbara Rogoff, a professor of psychology, and her colleagues describe the ways in which children in Indigenous communities can learn by observing and participating in community endeavors, having an eagerness to contribute, fulfilling valuable roles, and finding a sense of belonging in their community. These learning experiences rely on children's incorporation in the community and the child's attentiveness. This form of informal learning allows the children to collaborate in social endeavors, which grants the child the opportunity to learn by pitching in. Learning occurs through socialization processes in one's culture and community. Learning by observing and pitching in (LOPI) is an Informal learning model often seen in many Indigenous communities of the Americas. http://www.nvit.bc.ca/docs/learning%20styles%20of%20american%20indianalaska%20native%20students%20a%20review%20of%20the%20literature%20and%20implications%20for%20practice.pdf Children can be seen participating alongside adults in many daily activities within the community. An example is the process where children learn slash- and-burn agriculture by being present in the situation and contributing when possible. Noteworthy is children's own initiative and assumption of responsibility to perform tasks for the households' benefit. Many Indigenous communities provide self-paced opportunities to kids, and allow exploration and education without parental coercion. Collaborative input is highly encouraged and valued. Both children and adults are actively involved in shared endeavors. Their roles as learner and expert are flexible, while the observer participates with active concentration. Indigenous ways of learning include practices such as observation, experiential learning, and apprenticeship. Child work, alongside and combined with play, occupies an important place in American Indigenous children's time and development. The interaction of a Navajo girl assisting her mother weaving and who eventually becomes a master weaver herself illustrates how the child's presence and the availability of these activities allow the child to learn through observation. Children start at the periphery, observing and imitating those around them, before moving into the center of activities under supervision and guidance. An example of 2-year-old Indigenous Mexican girl participating in digging-the- holes project with her mother highlights children's own initiation to help, after watching, and enthusiasm to share the task with family and community. Work is part of a child's development from an early age, starting with simple tasks that merge with play and develop to various kinds of useful work. The circumstances of everyday routine create opportunities for the culturally meaningful activities and sensitive interactions on which a child's development depends. Children of the Chillihuani observe their environment as a place of respect, and learn from observation. Many of them become herders by informal learning in observation. Children in Nicaragua will often learn to work the land or learn to become street vendors by watching other individuals in their community perform it. These activities provide opportunities for children to learn and develop through forms of social learning which are made up of everyday experiences rather than a deliberate curriculum, and contain ordinary setting in which children's social interaction and behavior occur. Informal learning for children in American Indigenous communities can take place at work where children are expected to contribute. Nonverbal communication as a learning tool In terms of the cultural variation between traditional Indigenous American and European-American middle class, the prevalence of nonverbal communication can be viewed as being dependent on each culture's definition of achievement. Often in mainstream middle-class culture, success in school and work settings is gained through practicing competitiveness and working for personal gain.Wynia, E. A. (2000). Teach the way the student learns: Culturally relevant teaching strategies appropriate to the Native American student in the speech communication classroom. North Dakota Journal of Speech and Theatre, 14. The learning and teaching practices of traditional Indigenous Americans generally prioritize harmony and cooperation over personal gain. In order to achieve mutual respect in teachings, what is often relied on in Indigenous American culture is nonverbal communication.Hwang, C. Philip, Michael E. Lamb, and Irving E. Siegel. \\"Learning Respect for Everything: Navajo Images of Development.\\" Images of Childhood. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996. 167-83. Nonverbal communication in Indigenous communities creates pathways of knowledge by watching and then doing. An example where nonverbal behavior can be used as a learning tool can be seen in Chillihuani culture. Children in this community learn about growing crops by observing the actions and respect adults have for the land. They learn that caring for their crops is vital for them to grow and in turn for the community to thrive. Similarly, when children participate in rituals, they learn the importance of being part of the community by watching how everyone interacts. This again needs no explicit verbal communication, it relies solely on observing the world around. Chillihuani culture does not explicitly verbalize expectations. Their knowledge is experienced rather than explained through modeled behavior for community benefit. In the indigenous culture of the Matsigenka, infants are kept in close proximity to their mother and members of the community. The infant does not go far from the mother at any time. In this way, the child is encouraged to explore away from the mother and other family members who will still keep watch. As the child wanders he may come to a place that is unknown and potentially dangerous but the mother will not stop him, she will just watch as he explores. The lack of verbal reprimand or warning from an adult or elder enable the child to assimilate his surroundings more carefully.Ochs, E., & Izquierdo, C. (n.d.). Responsibility in childhood: Three developmental trajectories. Formal and informal education To fully understand informal learning it is useful to define the terms \\"formal\\" and \\"informal\\" education. Formal education can be defined as a setting that is highly institutionalized, can be possibly bureaucratic, while being curriculum driven, and formally recognized with grades, diplomas, or other forms of certifications. Informal education is closely tied in with informal learning, which occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. Informal learning often takes place outside educational establishments, and does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, or sporadically, in association with certain occasions, although that is not always the case. Informal education can occur in the formal arena when concepts are adapted to the unique needs of individual students. Research and data Merriam and others (2007) state: \\"studies of informal learning, especially those asking about adults' self-directed learning projects, reveal that upwards of 90 percent of adults are engaged in hundreds of hours of informal learning. It has also been estimated that the great majority (upwards of 70 percent) of learning in the workplace is informal (Kim, Collins, Hagedorn, Williamson, & Chapman, 2004), although billions of dollars each year are spent by business and industry on formal training programs\\" (p. 35‚Äì36). Both formal and informal learning are considered integral processes for Virtual Human Resource Development (Bennett, 2009), with informal learning the stronger form. Experiences and examples Informal knowledge is information that has not been externalized or captured and the primary locus of the knowledge may be inside someone's head. (Grebow, David, \\"At the Water Cooler of Learning\\" in Conner, M. L., & Clawson, J.G. (eds.) \\"Transforming Culture: An Executive Briefing on the Power of Learning\\", Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2002). For example, in the cause of language acquisition, a mother may teach a child basic concepts of grammar and language at home, prior to the child entering a formal education system (Eaton, Sarah (2011). \\"Family Literacy and the New Canadian: Formal, Non- Formal and .Informal Learning: The Case of Literacy, Essential Skills and Language Learning in Canada\\"). In such a case, the mother has a tacit understanding of language structures, syntax and morphology, but she may not be explicitly aware of what these are. She understands the language and passes her knowledge on to her offspring. Other examples of informal knowledge transfer include instant messaging, a spontaneous meeting on the Internet, a phone call to someone who has information you need, a live one-time-only sales meeting introducing a new product, a chat-room in real time, a chance meeting by the water cooler, a scheduled Web-based meeting with a real-time agenda, a tech walking you through a repair process, or a meeting with your assigned mentor or manager. Experience indicates that much of the learning for performance is informal (The Institute for Research on Learning, 2000, Menlo Park). Those who transfer their knowledge to a learner are usually present in real time. Such learning can take place over the telephone or through the Internet, as well as in person. In the UK, the government formally recognized the benefits of informal learning in \\"The Learning Revolution\\" White Paper published on March 23, 2009 (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, 2009). The Learning Revolution Festival ran in October 2009 and funding has been used by libraries‚Äîwhich offer a host of informal learning opportunities such as book groups, \\"meet the author\\" events and family history sessions‚Äîto run activities such as The North East Festival of Learning. Trends in formal and informal learning 40% of adults have self-taught themselves at some point and respondents in a survey indicated that they were twice as likely to participate in independent learning as traditional learning. The average adult spends 10 hours a week (500 hours a year) on informal learning practices. As a whole, this type of knowledge is more learner-centered and situational in response to the interests or needed application of the skill to a particular workforce. Formal training programs have limited success in increasing basic skills for individuals older than age 25, therefore, these individuals rely mostly on on-the-job training. Although rates of formal education have increased, many adults entering the workforce are lacking the basic math, reading and interpersonal skills that the ‚Äúunskilled‚Äù labor force requires. The lines between formal and informal learning have been blurred due to the higher rates of college attendance. The largest increase in population for manual or low-skilled labor is in individuals who attended college but did not receive a degree. A recent collection of cross-sectional surveys were conducted and polled employers across the United States to gauge which skills are required for jobs which do not require college degrees. These surveys concluded that 70% require some kind of customer service aspect, 61% require reading or writing paragraphs, 65% require math, 51% require the use of computers. In regards to training and academic credentials, 71% require a high school diploma, 61% require specific vocational experience. The rates of men entering the low-skilled labor force have remained static over the last fifty years, indicating a shift of less than 1%. Women's participation in the unskilled labor force has steadily increased and projections indicate that this trend will continue. Business perspective The majority of companies that provide training are currently involved only with the formal side of the continuum. Most of today's investments are on the formal side. The net result is that companies spend the most money on the smallest part‚Äî25%‚Äîof the learning equation. The other 75% of learning happens as the learner creatively \\"adopts and adapts to ever changing circumstances\\". The informal piece of the equation is not only larger, it's crucial to learning how to do anything. Summary Lifelong learning, as defined by the OECD, includes a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning. Of these three, informal learning may be the most difficult to quantify or prove, but it remains critical to an individual's overall cognitive and social development throughout the lifespan.

It is approximately north-west of Bourne, and on the A151 road. While the civil parish is called \\"Edenham\\", the parish council is called Edenham, Grimsthorpe, Elsthorpe & Scottlethorpe Parish Council. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 291. The parish is principally located in the valley of the East Glen which flows through the village. Geology The broad valley is incised into a gently sloping and much dissected plateau of glacial till which is more graphically described by the older term, boulder clay. The till caps the ridges to either side, the one clothed by the Bourne Woods and the other by the park of Grimsthorpe Castle. All the solid geology is Jurassic. The valley sides are of Kellaways clay, Kellaways sand and Oxford clay while its bottom is of cornbrash and Blisworth clay. In the south and west of the parish are much greater exposures of this solid geology with extensive areas of Blisworth Limestone and the Upper Estuarine Series. In the valley, there are also strips of alluvium and patches of glacial sand and gravel.Institute of Geological Sciences Geological Maps of England and Wales One-Inch Series Sheet 143 (1967) Although Grimsthorpe Castle is on higher ground to the west, the village of Grimsthorpe shares the geology of the rest of the parish. \\\\- can be zoomed to show the villages Constituent settlements in the parish The main village is: * Edenham Edenham The parish includes a number of outlying hamlets: * Grimsthorpe * Scottlethorpe * Elsthorpe The parish is associated with two lost settlements: *Elsthorpe, located near the modern hamlet of that name. Aislestorp is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as belonging to Alfred of Lincoln and having a mill, 5 villagers, all Freemen; 2 ploughlands. 1 lord's plough team, 2 men's plough teams; 18 acres of Meadow, and 240 acres of Woodland. Sunken roads, building plots, and a fishpond have been located at the site of the original settlement. * Southorpe. Sudtorp is mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to Guy of Craon and having a mill, 10 villagers, of whom 6 were smallholders; 2 ploughlands. 2 lord's plough teams, 2 men's plough teams; 16 acres of Meadow, and 200 acres of Woodland. The village is mentioned from the time of the Domesday Survey onwards. There was a chantry chapel here in the 12th century. A priest was last instituted at Southorpe in 1521, and, by 1563, only one family remained. Administration Once part of the Beltisloe Wapentake in Kesteven, the parish is now part of South Kesteven District. Its obligations under the 19th century poor law were undertaken by the Bourne Poor Law Union from 1835 onwards. The present electoral arrangements are as follows: * South Kesteven District Council, Glen Eden ward, Councillor Maureen Spencer-Gregson OBEMaureen Spencer-Gregson OBE * Lincolnshire County Council, Folkingham Rural ward, Councillor Martin Hill OBEMartin Hill OBE * Westminster, Stamford and Grantham constituency, Gareth Davies MP * European Parliament, East Midlands, Derek Clark,Derek Clark Roger Helmer,Roger Helmer Glenis Willmott,Glenis Willmott Emma McClarkin,Emma McClarkin Bill Newton DunnBill Newton Dunn The Ecclesiastical parish follows the same boundaries, and is part of the Deanery of Beltisloe, preserving the old Wapentake boundaries. History The Edenham name derives from the Anglo Saxon ham, meaning \\"homestead\\". The rest of the name probably derives from dene, a \\"vale in woodland\\" and ea, \\"river\\", though \\"Eada's homestead\\" and \\"Eada's hemmed-in-land\\" have also been suggested. The river East Glen which flows through it is sometimes called the \\"Eden\\" by a process of back-formation from the name of the village. Edenham appears in the Domesday Book as having 32 villagers, 4 smallholders, 24 freemen, 5 lord's plough teams, and 9 men's plough teams, with of woodland and 29 acres of meadow. The parish was the site of the Cistercian abbey of Vaudey, founded in 1147 by William, Earl of Albemarle. It was dissolved during the 1536 Suppression.Cox, J. Charles (1916) Lincolnshire p. 120; Methuen & Co. Ltd Documents of 1307 mention the existence in Edenham of \\"a hospital\\". Since 1516 parish land and villages have been owned by the de Eresby family of Grimsthorpe Castle. This major ancestral seat to the north-west of the village influenced Edenham's estate village character. The de Eresby baronetcy has continued in an unbroken line since 1313, and heads of the family have been Earls and Dukes of Ancaster and the Earl of Lindsey. The 19th-century Baron Willoughby de Eresby built the Edenham and Little Bytham Railway which connected the village to the East Coast Main Line at Little Bytham.Pearson, R.E & Ruddock, J.G. Lord Willoughby's Railway the Edenham Branch (1986) Apart from crossing a road in near Little Bytham station, it ran exclusively on his estate. The Australian poet and novelist Frederic Manning stayed at the vicarage after he arrived in the country in 1903. He returned there after the First World War and began writing The Middle Parts of Fortune (republished in an expurgated version under the title Her Privates We), a novel which he completed in the neighbouring parish, Bourne. Community Village sign in Edenham The Grade I listed church retains some Anglo-Saxon fabric from the earlier building. The Saxon church was dedicated to the 'Holy Cross', but the dedication is now to St Michael, or St Michael and all Angels. It has an Angel Roof, the beams supported on the back of carved and painted angels. Family monuments were moved from St Matthew's church in Normanton when that church was affected by the construction of Rutland Water. The ecclesiastical parish is Edenham. The church, dedicated to St Michael and all Angels, is part of the Edenham with Witham On The Hill Group of the Beltisloe Deanery of the Diocese of Lincoln. The 2013 incumbent is Rev Canon Andrew Hawes., Diocese of Lincoln The vicarage, unlike other vicarages and rectories in rural parishes, has never been sold to a private buyer. It remains the spiritual centre of three parishes and eight small villages, and is run by the Diocese of Lincoln as a retreat for contemplation and prayer. A cedar tree overhangs the road from the churchyard, and nearby are the remains of a Saxon cross, a Grade II listed building and Scheduled Monument. The village Church of England primary school, also a Grade II listed building, has a roll of just over one hundred pupils. Apart from agricultural employers, businesses in the village include The Five Bells public house and the local school.

Vax employs over 400 staff across its Birmingham and Droitwich sites in the UK. History Vax UK Ltd was founded in December 1977 by Alan Brazier, who had prior experience in the field of industrial carpet cleaning. Brazier developed a prototype of a machine suitable for a household but capable of washing carpets and handling accident spillages or flooding. In 1979, Vax launched an \\"orange tub\\" multi-functional floor-care machine to fulfil this purpose and initially engaged with consumers by door-to-door sales of the device. This product was a world first. Trademark conflict with DEC and advertising slogan Although Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX minicomputer was introduced October 25, 1977 and Vax UK Ltd was formed months later, DEC (for a while) still had a trademark problem. In 1986-87 and some later advertisements, the company adopted the slogan, \\"Nothing sucks like a Vax!\\" This echoed its competitor's slogan from the 1960s, \\"Nothing sucks like Electrolux\\". Playing on the double meaning of the word \\"sucks\\", the slogan \\"Nothing sucks like a VAX!\\" was used by critics of the VAX computer and complex instruction set computers in general.VAX - Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing Vax products were first offered for sale by high-street retailers in 1982, and the 111 Orange Tub model went on to become a top-selling vacuum cleaning product.

By July 1991, he had left the company to produce this product independently.Against the Odds: An Autobiography by James Dyson In July 2010, Dyson attempted to bring legal action against Vax, over its Mach Zen vacuum cleaner, in the High Court for infringement of design patents. However, in 2011 the UK Court of Appeal rejected this claim. In 2011, Student Placement Engineer Jake Tyler developed Vax ev, a working prototype of the world's first cardboard vacuum cleaner.

In more recent years, it has turned to publication of translations of popular English-language novels. History Magia i Miecz Despite the rise of the role-playing game industry in the United States and the U.K. during the 1980s, very few people in Poland under Communist rule were aware of the existence of role-playing games. Following the fall of Communist rule, Jacek Rodek, the editor-in-chief of Fantaskya, a monthly magazine dedicated to fantasy and science fiction, founded the publishing company Wydawnictwo MAG in order to publish Magia i Miecz (Magic and Sword), a magazine that would be dedicated to role-playing games. Rodek and Daros≈Çaw J. Toru≈Ñ were the first editors. Due to a lack of published role-playing games in Poland at the time, the first six issues of the magazine focussed on Kryszta≈Çy Czasu (Crystals of Time), an unpublished Polish RPG created by Artur Szyndler. The first issue printed the rules, and subsequent issues featured articles about character generation, magic and spellcasting, and descriptions of the game world. The first full adventures for Kryszta≈Çy Czasu appeared in issues #4‚Äì#6: ‚ÄûNieproszony go≈õƒá‚Äù (\\"Uninvited Guest\\"), ‚ÄûDemoniczna horda‚Äù (\\"Demonic Horde\\"), and ‚ÄûPu≈Çapki w pu≈Çapkach‚Äù (\\"Traps Inside Traps\\"). MAG published a hardcover version of Kryszta≈Çy Czasu in 1999. Role-playing games Magia i Mieczs monthly circulation of 20,000 indicated there was an audience for RPGs in Poland, so MAG acquired the Polish-language licenses for several popular British and American role-playing games, including: * Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay * Call of Cthulhu * Deadlands * Fading Suns * Earthdawn MAG released Polish-language editions of several tabletop games, notably Doomtrooper, and the Kult collectible card game (CCG), and also published some original Polish RPGs such as Wied≈∫min - Gra Wyobra≈∫ni (The Witcher: A Game of Imagination), based on a series of novels and short stories written by Andrzej Sapkowski. Book publisher By 2001, Magia i Miecz had become unprofitable as its circulation waned to 10,000. MAG stopped publishing the magazine, and pivoted from role-playing games to books, specializing in science-fiction, horror and fantasy, children's literature and contemporary fiction, primarily translations of popular English-language novels. Its long-running Uczta Wyobra≈∫ni (Feast of the Imagination) series, started in 2006, features over 60 works by authors such as Ian McDonald, William Gibson, Christopher Priest, Susannah Clarke, and Bruce Sterling. MAG has also enjoyed great success republishing the works of Neil Gaiman and Christopher Paolini ‚Äî in 2005‚Äì2006, Polish sales of Paolini's novel Eragon topped 135,000. MAG also publishes novels by well-known Polish writers such as Feliks W. Kres.

History In 1886, the magazine's headquarters moved from Manchester to London where it paved the way for popular journalism ‚Äì most significantly, the Daily Mail was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, a contributor to Tit-Bits, and the Daily Express was launched by Arthur Pearson, who worked at Tit-Bits for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine. (republished 2008) From the outset, the magazine was a mass-circulation commercial publication on cheap newsprint which soon reached sales of between 400,000 and 600,000. Like a mini-encyclopedia it presented a diverse range of tit-bits of information in an easy-to-read format, with the emphasis on human interest stories concentrating on drama and sensation.Martin Conboy Journalism: A Critical History It also featured short stories and full-length fiction, including works by authors such as Rider Haggard and Isaac Asimov, plus three very early stories by Christopher Priest. Virginia Woolf submitted her first article to the paper in 1890, at the age of eight, but it was turned down.Amy Licence, Living in Squares, Loving in Triangles: The Lives and Loves of Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Groupg (Amberley Publishing, 2015), p. 20 The first humorous article by P. G. Wodehouse, \\"Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings\\", appeared in Tit-Bits in November 1900.From the chronology maintained by the Russian Wodehouse Society During the First World War Ivor Novello won a Titbits competition to write a song soldiers could sing at the front: he penned Keep the Home Fires Burning. Pin-ups appeared on the magazine's covers from 1939 and by 1955 circulation peaked at 1,150,000. At the beginning of 1973 Tit-Bits lost the hyphen from its masthead. In 1979 Reveille (a weekly tabloid with a virtually identical demographic) was merged into Titbits, and the magazine was briefly rebranded as Titbits incorporating Reveille. This however was dropped in July 1981. On 18 July 1984, under its last editor Paul Hopkins, Titbits was selling only 170,000 copies and was taken over by Associated Newspapers' Weekend. At the time, the Financial Times described Titbits as \\"the 103-year-old progenitor of Britain's popular press\\". Weekend itself closed in 1989. Cultural influence  In All Things Considered by G. K. Chesterton, the author contrasts Tit-Bits with the Times, saying: \\"Let any honest reader... ask himself whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write the front page of The Times, which is full of long leading articles, or the front page of Tit-Bits, which is full of short jokes.\\" Reference to the magazine is also made in James Joyce's Ulysses,\\"In the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits.\\" Calypso episode of Ulysses by James Joyce.

Robinson Vines Grapes & Wines pg 199 Mitchell Beazley 1986 While a red wine grape, Pineau d'Aunis is often treated like Pinot noir and used to make ros√© and white wines in both still and sparkling wine styles. History Pineau d'Aunis was reportedly a favorite wine of the English King Henry III who had the wine first brought to England in 1246. The name Pineau comes from the French word pin and refers to the pine cone shape that clusters of grapes can resemble. It was first used to describe a grapevine growing in the Loire Valley in 1183 AD but whether or not this was Pineau d'Aunis is not known since Pineau has been a synonym used for Pinot noir, Chenin blanc and Menu Pineau (Arbois). Aunis, within what is now the Charente-Maritime department, was a pays erected into a historical province, the smallest of France, in 1374; it was a fief of the Duchy of Aquitaine, brought to the English monarchy by Eleanor of Aquitaine. In Aunis the grape may have once been grown, but is currently not widely planted. However, wine writer Oz Clarke believes that the grape was named after a priory known as Aunis that existed outside of the commune of Saumur during the Middle Ages.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 169 Harcourt Books 2001 Today what is left of the Aunis priory belongs to the Fontevraud Abbey in Chinon.Richard Kelley \\"Pineau d‚ÄôAunis\\" Richard Kelley's Definitive Guide to the Wines of the Loire Valley Accessed: March 28th, 2013 Author Michel Freyssinet speculates that Pineau d'Aunis may have originated in the Vend√©e region and was brought to the Loire region by salt merchants sailing up the Atlantic coast. According to Freyssinet, the vine was first planted in Chahaignes in what is now the Sarthe department of the Loire in the 9th century. Middle Ages The grape was known in England by the 13th century when it was a favorite wine of King Henry III of England. Henry, the son of John Plantagenet and Isabella of Angoul√™me (a commune is what is now the Charente department), began importing casks of Pineau d'Aunis wine to England in 1246.1246 is the date of a terrier or schedule of landed properties printed by A. Bardonnet, \\"Le terrier du grand fief d'Aunis, texte fran√ßais de 1246\\", in M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© des Antiquaires de L'ouest, 38, for 1874 (1875), pp. 55- 296, that is noted in C.

In England, the usually light colored Pineau d'Aunis was often blended with darker colored wines such as those made from red-fleshed teinturiers. The wine that Henry imported was labeled as vin clairet, leaving wine writer Richard Kelley to presume that Pineau d'Aunis was the \\"original claret\\". During the Hundred Years' War, King Charles VII of France gave Philip the Good, the Duke of Burgundy, vines of Pineau d'Aunis as a peace offering in 1425. Other accounts say that Charles' gift of Pineau d'Aunis was made to John VI, Duke of Brittany instead.Maison Ackerman \\"UN PEU D'HISTOIRE-Pineau d'Aunis\\" (French) Accessed: March 28th, 2013 19th century to modern times Though Pineau d'Aunis has been known as Chenin noir, it has no known relation with Chenin blanc. (pictured). In 1816, Andr√© Jullien described Pineau d'Aunis as being widely grown throughout the Loire, particularly in the Loches commune of Touraine. In 1845, French ampelographer Alexandre-Pierre Odart described Pineau d'Aunis as Chenin noir which led to speculation that Chenin blanc, the notable Loire grape of Vouvray and Savenni√®res, was a color mutation of Pineau d'Aunis. However, DNA testing in the early 21st century confirmed that Pineau d'Aunis is not related at all with Chenin blanc nor Pinot noir, with which it is frequently confused. As with most French wine grapes, the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century drastically cut into the Pineau d'Aunis plantings in France. The construction of the Paris‚ÄìBordeaux railway as well as the 1980s high-speed expansion of the LGV Atlantique and the planned construction of the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique threaten to gobble up more plantings of Pineau d'Aunis but sparked some vignerons to launch conservation efforts to save the variety from extinction. In 1958, there were 1,741 hectares (4,302 acres) of Pineau d'Aunis planted in France. Throughout the rest of the 20th century that number would steadily decline and by 2009 there were 435 hectares (1,075 acres) in France. Viticulture Pineau d'Aunis is a mid-ripening variety that can produce very irregular yields with the quality of the resulting wine sharply diminished if yields become too excessive. Like the Pinot grapes, the vine produces small, compact bunches that can be highly susceptible to botrytis bunch rot, particularly in wet climates. Chlorosis is another viticultural hazards that can impact Pineau d'Aunis, inhibiting photosynthesis and leaving the leaves of the grapevine prone to sunburn and browning. Wine writer Richard Kelley notes that Pineau d'Aunis is a \\"very terroir-sensitive\\" variety that will greatly reflect the vineyard soils and growing conditions that it experience. In soils with high limestone content, it can ripen very quickly which can limit the amount of phenolics and aromatic compounds that have time to develop. However, cooler soils with high clay content and high water capacity may retard the ripening too drastically. The variety has a tendency to bud irregularly, depending on the climate. It will always bud after Chardonnay, Gamay and Pinot noir, and thus have much less risk of suffering from spring time frost, but will bud much earlier than Cabernet Franc. Depending on the vintage, Pineau d'Aunis will usually bud around 4 to 5 days before Chenin blanc followed by flowering at about the same time as Chenin. Like Gamay, Pineau d'Aunis will develop thick, reddish-color stalks in the autumn with the leaves changing color to a bright red with purple/bluish veins. Clones and rootstock Currently, there are two clones of Pineau d'Aunis being widely propagated. Clone #289 which lends itself more to vin gris style wines and Clone #235. In recent years, some vignerons have been moving away from using clonal selections in lieu of using massale cuttings taken from a broad swath of vines from old \\"pre-clonal\\" vineyards with the aim of creating more genetic diversity in the vineyard. Like many French grape varieties, plantings of Pineau d'Aunis from the 1960s onward were most often grafted onto SO4 rootstock (an interspecfic crossing of Vitis berlandieri and Vitis riparia). Given Pineau d'Aunis susceptibility to chlorosis, this rootstock did particularly well in vineyards with high calcium content in the soil. However, in most other soils, the rootstock propensity for increased vigor and creating excessive foliage created problems for the vine with canopy management and increase susceptibility to mildew and rot. In recent years, more vignerons have been turning to Riparia Gloire de Montpellier (derived only from Vitis riparia) rootstock. Wine regions Pineau d'Aunis has been grown throughout the Loire Valley. Historically Pineau d'Aunis has been grown throughout the Loire Valley and Centre-Val de Loire region of France with plantings in the Indre-et-Loire, Loir-et-Cher, Loiret, Maine-et-Loire, Sarthe and Vienne departments. Today it is most closely associated with the Anjou and Touraine region of the middle Loire where it is a permitted grape variety in several AOCs including Anjou, Saumur, Touraine, Valen√ßay, Coteaux du Loir and Coteaux du Vend√¥mois. AOC regulations In the Anjou AOC, Pineau d'Aunis can make up the blend for the general rouge wine along with Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Gamay. Here the grapes are limited to harvest yields of no more than 40 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 2 tons/acre) with the finished wine needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 10%. In the sparkling ros√©s of Anjou Mousseux it can be blended with the same grapes as the rouge, plus Groslot, with yields that can go up to 65 hl/ha (‚âà 3.4 tons/acre) and a minimum alcohol level of 9.5%.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pgs 35-109 Firefly Books 2004 For both the reds and ros√© of the Coteaux du Loir, based around the Loir tributary of the larger Loire river, Pineau d'Aunis is limited to harvest yields of 55 hl/ha (‚âà 3 tons/acre) and is blended with Cabernet Franc and Malbec in a wine that must have at least 9% alcohol by volume. White wine can be made from the red Pineau d'Aunis grapes by pressing whole clusters of the grape (example with Pinot noir) quickly after harvest, leaving no time for skin contact that extracts the color compounds of the skins into the clear juice. In the town of Vend√¥me in the Loir-et-Cher department, Pineau d'Aunis is made into a varietal wine of all colors (red, ros√© and white) in Coteaux du Vend√¥mois. The white AOC wine is made from whole cluster pressingof the grapes soon after harvest with no skin contact to extract color. Grapes for the red and ros√© are limited by a maximum yield of 60 hl/ha (65 hl/ha for the white) with the finished wines having a minimum alcohol level of 9% (9.5% for the white). For the sparkling ros√© and white Cr√©mant de Loire which spans the Loire Valley wine region, Pineau d'Aunis can be used in a blend with Chenin blanc, Cabernet Franc, Pinot noir, Groslot, Arbois and Chardonnay. For this AOC, yields for all wines are limited to 50 hl/ha with the wines having at least 9.5% alcohol by volume. For sparkling Saumur, Pineau d'Aunis is blended with most of the same varieties as Cr√©mant de Loire (with Sauvignon blanc and Malbec instead of Arbois and Gamay permitted for the sparkling red and ros√©s) but yields are allowed to go up to 60 hl/ha though the wine needs to meet the same minimum alcohol. In Touraine, the sparkling c√©page allows Pineau d'Aunis to be blended with any of the varieties used in both Saumur and Cr√©mant de Loire under the same minimum alcohol restrictions but with an even higher yield allowance of 65 hl/ha. Pineau d'Aunis is also permitted in the red and ros√© of the Saumur AOC where it is blended with both Cabernet grapes as well as Groslot. Similar to the greater Anjou AOC, yields are restricted to 40 ha/hla with a minimum alcohol level of 10%. In the red wine-only sub region of Saumur-Champigny, Pineau d'Aunis is only blended with the Cabernet varieties but with the same maximum yield and minimum alcohol restrictions. In the general Touraine AOC, the Pineau d'Aunis is limited to harvest yields of 55 hl/ha and can be blended with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Gamay, Malbec, Pinot noir, Groslot and Pinot gris in the red and ros√© wines of the AOC. The minimum alcohol level for these wines much reach at least 9%. Along the Cher river, Pineau d'Aunis is grown in the Valen√ßay AOC where it is blended with the Cabernet varieties, Malbec and Gamay in the red and ros√© wines. Grapes are restricted to yields of 45 hl/ha with a minimum 9% alcohol by volume.  Styles  White pepper is a classic aroma note associated with Pineau d'Aunis wines. Pineau d'Aunis can be made into a wide range of wine styles from red, ros√© to white and in both still and sparkling styles. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Pineau d'Aunis as a red wine tends to produce slightly tannic wines and with all styles can contribute noticeable acidity and white pepper notes. Richard Kelley notes that the quality of varietal Pineau d'Aunis will depend heavily on the type of yields that the grape was harvested at, as well as the age of the vines. Well made examples of red Pineau d'Aunis from favorable vintages will have the characteristic white pepper note of the variety as cherry, raspberry and strawberry fruit flavor and sometimes kirsch and confit notes. Long, slow fermentations at cool temperatures (around 20 ¬∞C/68 ¬∞F) will help to extract aromas that don't stray \\"baked\\" fruit flavors. The low phenolics and anthocyanin content can make color extraction difficult, though this can be enhanced with both blending as well as \\"bleeding off\\" (saign√©e) some of the juice to more concentrate the must.

It is directed by Robert Favreau based on the novel A Sunday at the pool in Kigali by Gil Courtemanche. Plot Bernard Valcourt, a documentary filmmaker, and journalist, sets off to Kigali to film a documentary about AIDS. He gets caught up in the turmoil of horrific events involving Hutus and Tutsis that tragically leads to genocide. During his stay at the H√¥tel des Mille Collines, Valcourt falls in love with a beautiful, shy waitress named Gentille. Gentille serves drinks to the diplomats, officials, and Rwandan bourgeoisie who surround the hotel swimming pool every Sunday. While Valcourt's longing for Gentille increases, the country moves toward civil war, and the brutal violence of the Rwandan genocide separates them. A few months go by and Bernard returns to Rwanda, frantically seeking Gentille in the midst of the chaos. Most of the narrative unfolds in retrospect. Release A Sunday in Kigali grossed $1.1 million Canadian in Quebec in the fall of 2006, and is set for September 23 release in English-speaking Canada.

A report conducted in 1992 through Canada's Immigration Act authored by the Solicitor General and Minister of Immigration alleged that Al Yamani was a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The report was sent to the Security Intelligence Review Committee, (SIRC). As a result of the report a security certificate was created for Al Yamani in 1993. Al Yamani then applied for and was granted a judicial review of his case. Justice Mackay agreed with Al Yamani's Charter-based argument that a portion of the legislation used to charge him contravened his right to freedom of association. Based on this ruling the first security certificate against Yamani was dismissed. In 1997 the SIRC issued a second certificate, which was also ended by the judge's ruling that their case had ignored key evidence on the accused's behalf. In 2000 Al Yamani was informed that security proceedings against him would be dropped, but the Minister of Immigration began an inquiry in consideration of changes to the legislation that had occurred in 1993. Al Yamani's attempt at a stay of the charges was denied in 2001, and a new application for his removal was begun shortly after, under regular immigration proceedings rather than the security certificate provision. Most recently a deportation order was issued for his removal on April 20, 2006. It has yet to be executed.Al Yamani v.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles, and is one of the Earth's most important economic sectors by revenue. The first practical automobile with a petrol engine was built by Karl Benz in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. United Kingdom ARG had a fairly quiet year in 1985, with the only significant changes being the addition of an MG variant to the Montego range. On the rally scene, however, eyebrows were raised at the arrival of a spectacular new mid-engined supercar - the MG Metro 6R4, with four-wheel drive and a V6 engine. The MG version of the Maestro was upgraded from a 1.6 to a 2.0, with the twin Weber carburettors making way for electronic fuel injection. Ford achieved success with the latest incarnation of its big Granada. The new car, which went on sale in May, was a radical hatchback-only design which brought back memories of the Sierra's launch nearly three years ago. Ford has refused to rule out the possibility of saloon and estate versions at a later date, but the current hatchback is proving popular thanks to its high equipment levels, comfortable interior, solid build and (for a car of the size and level of specification) a competitive asking price. On the continent the \\"Scorpio\\" name covers the whole range, while Britain and Ireland only see the new nameplate as an extra on range-topping 2.8 and 2.9 V6 models, which are known as \\"Granada Scorpio\\". A year after its launch, the Vauxhall Astra hatchback and estate ranges have been joined by a saloon. Rather than adopt the same name as used by the hatchback, Vauxhall has been the latest of several manufacturers to follow a new trend of creating a new name for the saloon version. The saloon version of the Astra is known as the \\"Belmont\\", while the continental version shares the Kadett name with the rest of the range. The new model would launch in January 1986.  France  Peugeot announces that the Talbot marque will be discontinued on passenger cars next year, and the Horizon replacement launched in October 1985 will instead be sold as the Peugeot 309.Mus√©e de l'Aventure Peugeot. The exhibit label (2012) states candidly: ¬´Pr√©vu d‚Äôabord de succ√©der √† la Talbot Horizon sous le nom de Talbot Arizona, on a choisi de l‚Äôappeler Peugeot 309. Choix motiv√© par des raisons de marketing, la marque Talbot affichait des r√©sultats catastrophiques, et les Peugeot de g√©n√©ration 5 avait d√©j√† une 305. ¬ª A larger family saloon is due for a 1987 launch, effectively taking over from the outdated Rapier/Minx (formerly Alpine) models and replacing at least some of the 305 or 505 ranges. Renault launched the second- generation of the R5 at the start of the year and offered a more modern appearance and more interior space than its 13-year-old predecessor. Italy The recent revival at Lancia has been completed with the addition of two new very different cars. The marque's new entry-level model is the Y10 - a three- door compact hatchback which can be seen as an Autobianchi on the continent. Power (though not a great deal of it) comes from a 1.0 FIRE engine which is very economical, and also from a long-running 1.1 unit which was seen more than a decade ago in the Autobianchi A112 Abarth. This larger unit comes with a turbocharger and pumps out an impressive 76 bhp, making it the far more impressive of the car's two engines. Also new on the Lancia price list is the Thema, a large four-door saloon which is designed to compete with the upmarket likes of the BMW 5 Series. It is designed by Pininfarina and few of its competitors can match it for interior space and comfort. Equipment levels, refinement, ride and handling are good too. It is the first of four cars to be spawned from a new platform which is to be shared between Fiat and General Motors. The second of these cars goes on sale this year - the Saab 9000. The third and fourth cars - from Fiat and Alfa Romeo respectively - are expected to be on sale within two years. The base engine is a 2.0 unit, which is also available with a turbocharger. The range-topper is a 2.8 V6, and there will soon be an exciting Ferrari-engined version which is set to sell in limited numbers. Sweden Saab has expanded its range with its first competitor in the sector dominated by the BMW 5 Series - the Saab 9000. The new car is a spacious, well-equipped, comfortable and refined five-door hatchback which shares its underpinnings with the new Lancia Thema as well as two forthcoming new big cars from Fiat and Alfa Romeo. With a practical hatchback bodystyle housing a top-notch luxury interior, the Saab 9000 appears to have all the right ingredients for a successful BMW rival. Germany The Mercedes E-Class is the latest of this year's competitors in the market sector dominated by the BMW 5 Series. The offering from Mercedes is a four-door saloon and five-door estate with the highest levels of specification and quality you can expect on this size of car. The whole estate range and some of the saloons have the option of self-levelling suspension, an innovation which was created by Citroen. The range starts with a moderately powerful 2.3 petrol engine, which like the entire range has fuel injection. Top of the range is a 3.2 V6, though even more fast and powerful V8 engines are rumoured at a later date. Volkswagen launched a 4-wheel drive version of the Golf mk2, called the Golf Country. The company also expanded the already impressive Golf range with a 16-valve version of the GTI. The original 1.8 8-valve GTI was a highly impressive \\"hot hatchback\\" which has proved itself even better than the first Golf GTI of 1976, but the new, more powerful GTI is one of the fastest hatchbacks ever produced with a top speed of well over 120 mph. It has the handling, looks and quality to match its high speed, and the Golf is fast becoming one of the fashion icons of the 1980s. Spain With SEAT no longer involved with Fiat, the new Ibiza is the Spanish firm's first design not to have been derived from a Fiat. It was penned by world-famous Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro, but mysteriously uses the same suspension as the Fiat Strada, and is the first SEAT to be imported to the UK. Its engines have been developed in conjunction with Porsche, and as a result its advertising campaign features the slogan \\"Italian styling and German engines\\" - which appear to be an impressive combination. The car's price is significantly lower than that of the similarly-sized Ford Escort, which suggests that it is not up to the standards of more mainstream rivals. In this case, the answer is \\"yes\\", but the Ibiza isn't far off. Japan Nissan is in the process of building a new plant at Sunderland in order to cut the cost of exporting cars to Europe. The new factory is set to open in the summer of next year, and will churn out the Bluebird range. There are future plans for the entry-level Micra to be built at Sunderland.

Being an ideologue of Pan-Turkism, his writings and poems had a major impact on defining the term vatan (Fatherland). Biography Painting of Mehmet Emin Yurdakul by Hoca Ali Rƒ±za He was born in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire during the late Tanzimat period on May 13, 1869. His father was Salih Reis, a fisherman, and his mother was Emine Hatun. His received his early education in Istanbul, but didn't formally graduate due to the dire financial situation within the family. He then began a internship in the ottoman administration. He published the book Fazilet ve Asalet in 1891, which caused the prime minister to appoint him to work in his office as the director of documentation. His early literary work was influenced by JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-AfghƒÅnƒ´, who he was to get to know in Constantinople in 1892.

Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606 (2001), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a claimant does not waive his right to challenge a regulation as an uncompensated regulatory taking by purchasing property after the enactment of the regulation challenged..  Background   Parties  ; Plaintiff/Petitioner : Anthony Palazzolo, owner of a waterfront parcel of land in the town of Westerly, Rhode Island, almost all of which is designated coastal wetlands under Rhode Island law. ; Defendant/Respondent : Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council.  State of law  Prior to 1971, owners of coastal land required a permit from the Rhode Island Division of Harbors and Rivers (DHR) in order to erect structures on coastal lands. In 1971, Rhode Island enacted legislation creating the Coastal Resources Management Council, charged with protecting the state's coastal properties. Regulations promulgated by the council protected coastal salt marshes as \\"coastal wetlands,'\\" on which construction was severely limited. Facts of case In 1959, Petitioner Palazzolo and business associates, operating under the name Shore Gardens, Inc. (SGI) purchased three undeveloped parcels on the Rhode Island coast. Petitioner Palazzolo eventually became sole shareholder of SGI, and began efforts to develop the land by submitting parcelling plans to the town. As the land required significant filling, Petitioner Palazzolo submitted applications for permits from the Division of Harbors and Rivers, which were denied. In 1978, Palazzolo acquired all of SGI's properties. In 1983, Petitioner Palazzolo again attempted to develop the land, submitting several permits, all of which were rejected. He also challenged the Council's determinations as contrary to the principles of state administrative law, but the courts affirmed the Council's actions. Prior history Petitioner Palazzolo sued in Rhode Island courts for inverse condemnation. Eventually, the Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected his claims. Procedural posture Petitioner Palazzolo sought reversal of Rhode Island courts' judgments, and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Legal analysis Issue The Court addressed whether the Rhode Island Supreme Court erred in holding that Petitioner did not have standing to claim a regulatory taking because he acquired the property after the enactment of regulations, and that Petitioner did not endure a total taking because some of the parcel remains economically usable. Arguments/theories ; Petitioner : Petitioner Palazzolo argued that the denial of a permit for filling by the Respondent Council effects a taking without compensation under the total takings analysis of Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council because the denial deprives him of \\"all economically beneficial use\\" of the land. ; Rhode Island Supreme court : The Rhode Island Supreme Court held that (1) Petitioner Palazzolo had no right to challenge the permit denial as a total taking because he acquired the property after the enactment of the regulation under which the permit was denied, and therefore had sufficient notice of such regulation; (2) the upland portions of the land were available for development, and therefore Palazzolo was not deprived of all economically beneficial use (as required under Lucas); and (3) Palazzolo cannot claim a taking under the more general balancing test of Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City. Rule of law The Court ruled that a claimant does not waive his right to challenge a regulation as an uncompensated taking by purchasing property after the enactment of the regulation challenged. Holding The Court held that the Rhode Island Supreme Court erred in holding that Petitioner did not have standing to sue because he acquired the property after the enactment of regulations. However, the Court also held that Palazzolo could not assert a takings claim based on the denial of all economic use of his property in light of undisputed evidence that the upland portion of the property was economically viable. Finally, the Court did not address the issue of whether reasonable \\"investment backed expectations\\" were affected by a regulation that pre-dated Palazzolo's ownership of the land, which were not addressed earlier. Therefore, the Court remanded the case back to the Rhode Island Supreme Court to re-examine under the Penn Central analysis. Reasoning The majority argued, regarding the first holding, as follows: The argument that a claimant who acquires property after the enactment of a regulation waives the right to challenge such regulation as an unconstitutional regulatory taking fails because (1) such a principle would make the constitutionality of a regulation a matter of the passage of time, thereby creating a \\"[statute of limitations]\\" on a constitutional right; (2) such a principle also prejudices owners at the time of regulation, whose ability to transfer the land has become seriously impaired; and (3) such a principle would create different and unequal rights between different classes of owners (old owners and new owners). Result Judgment/disposition Rhode Island Supreme Court judgment reversed in part and remanded. Subsequent history Case thrown out at a lower court.

New engine had bimetallic pistons to lower oil consumption and new 8-port cylinder head, which improved power output and allowed engine to run on unleaded fuel. To fit new cylinder head, engine block had to be modified. In 1993, engine was available with Bosch single-point injection system with catalytic converter. In 1996 engine was further modified to meet EURO2 emission standard, modifications included multipoint injection system, larger camshaft bearings and larger intake/exhaust valves, which further improved power output and efficiency of engine. In 1999 engine received last major modification. Engine block was reinforced and modified to fit larger 78mm crankshaft, valvetrain and lubrication system was modified to fit hydraulic tappets. As there was no need for distributor (MPI used ignition module mounted to cylinder head), valvetrain cover (in previous engines unchanged since 1964) could be made narrower, moving accessory belt closer to engine, so engine could be fitted to VW Lupo. Injection system was upgraded, now using two lambda probes and drive-by-wire throttle valve.

The Jepson Manual notes that the present distribution is limited to the deltaic Sacramento Valley, principally Napa and Solano Counties,The Jepson Manual, University of California Press 1993 but the historic range of L. conjugens is known to be significantly wider. In any case, historically the range has included parts of the North Coast, Sacramento Valley, and San Francisco Bay AreaSensitive Species of the San Francisco Bay Area as well as the South Coast. Alternatively and less frequently this taxon has been referred to as Baeria fremontii var. conjugens. Even though this plant is found almost exclusively in vernal pools, its behavior in controlled experiments indicates it prefers less than complete inundation. This implies that the plant actually prefers a theoretically drier environment, but is merely less successful than its competitors in surviving in drier (non-inundation) climate regimes.Gerhardt, Fritz and Sharon Collinge, Causes of rarity in the vernal pool endemic \\"Lasthenia conjugens\\" (Asteraceae), ESA August 5, 2003, Session # 36: Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Species Plants Description Lastenia conjugens is an herb whose stems are simple or freely branched and erect, attaining a height of less than 40 centimeters. Their glabrous leaves, of length of approximately eight centimeters, are entire to pinnately lobed. Inflorescences appear in the form of solitary heads, with twelve to eighteen phyllaries fused at one third to less than mid length, a distinguishing hallmark for identification of this species.U.S. Federal Register Final Rule Listing Document (1997) An involucre structure measures six to ten millimeters and may be somewhat hemispheric. The receptacle presents as dome-shaped or obconic. The yellow ray flowers may number six to thirteen petals, and the five to ten millimeter ligules are yellow as well. The yellow disk flowers are numerous, and anther tips are linear to somewhat ovate. Style tips are triangular. The corollae are typically five-lobed. Style tips may be triangular or round, but typically hair-tufted. The glabrous club-shaped fruits are less than 1.5 millimeters across, black or gray in color, absent a pappus structure. The species is cross-pollinated. According to Greene, the chromosome characteristic is: 2n=12. Ecology Lasthenia conjugens relies upon insect pollination for fertilization, and dispersal of seed is largely by gravity. In undisturbed habitats, this and other species of Lasthenia are pollinated by specialist bee species, primarily in the genus Andrena.Thorp, Robbin W., and Wallace E. LaBerge. 2005. A revision of the bees of the genus Andrena of the Western Hemisphere. Part XV - Subgenus Hesperandrena. Illinois Natural History Survey Bulletin 37(2):65‚Äì94 Studies in Solano County natural and restoration habitats have shown variability between visitation rates to the two types of colonies; however, plant propagation rates were found to be similar between natural colonies and introduced ones, implying pollination is not a limiting factor of propagation.Ramp, Jennifer M., Pollination and seed set of the endangered vernal pool annual \\"Lasthenia conjugens\\" (Asteraceae), Botany 2004, Ecology Section An alternative conclusion is that members of one particular insect family, Sciaridae, are also efficient pollinators of L. conjugens, since it was the only insect family to visit the restoration colonies in significant numbers (the specialist bees are absent from these areas). Conservation The population trend for L. conjugens is one of declining numbers as well as shrinking range. According to Jepson, the historic range includes areas not in the present range: parts of the North Coast, more eastern reaches of the Sacramento Valley, more southerly parts of the San Francisco Bay Area and parts of the South Coast. Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service alludes to historic populations in Contra Costa County and Santa Clara County. More specifically another source defines the extended historic San Francisco Bay Area range to have extended from Richmond to Palo Alto By the year 1995 the populations of L. conjugens had declined to the point where there were only five colonies extant, all of which were within Napa and Solano Counties.U.S. Federal Register: Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reopening and Extension of Comment Period on Proposed Endangered Status for Four Plants From Vernal Pools and Mesic Areas in Northern California, May 18, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 96) Contra Costa Goldfields has been studied extensively with regard to genetic diversity of colonies. Some early findings were that repeated seedings in restoration colonies enhanced the resultant population of Lasthenia conjugens and hence ultimate survival. Collinge, Sharon, Testing community assembly theory in vernal pool restoration, ESA, August 6, 2002, Session #32: Testing Ecological Theory in Restoration Practice The subsequent finding has been made that genetic diversity has been able to be replicated for introduced colonies in a restoration environment, implying favorable long-term stability and viability for introduced colonies.Jennifer M. Ramp, Sharon K. Collinge1 and Tom A. Ranker, Restoration genetics of the vernal pool endemic Lasthenia conjugens (Asteraceae), Conservation Genetics, Volume 7, Number 5, Pages 631-649, October, 2006, Springer Netherlands, In addition to the federal status as an endangered species it gained on June 18, 1997, Lasthenia conjugens is acknowledged and protected under the Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP).Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan The Solano County Habitat Conservation Plan encourages corridor preservation among vernal pool habitats, which are essential for this species' survival; in addition the HCP states the importance of recognizing genetic differences amongst various colonies of L. conjugens in order to protect the total species genetic diversity.

Two railways, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis (the \\"Big Four\\") and the Lafayette, Muncie and Bloomington (the \\"Nickel Plate\\"), intersected at the site. Its first building was a shanty occupied by John Cosgrove, and was soon followed by the dwellings of Col. Templeton and others.

He is one of the pioneers of fetal medicine. His discoveries have revolutionised fetal medicine. He introduced the screening of chromosomal and structural abnormalities, has improved the screening and prevention of pre-eclampsia and premature birth and allowed the development of fetal therapy.  Early life and education  Nicolaides was born in 1953 in Paphos, Cyprus. He studied medicine at King‚Äôs College School of Medicine and Dentistry in London and soon after graduation joined the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1980, doing research with Professor Stuart Campbell and Professor Charles Rodeck as his first assistant, working mainly on fetoscopic techniques and procedures. His manual dexterity at procedures and the Rodeck-Nicolaides team soon produced some important papers on the use of fetoscopy in the management of a wide range of conditions such Rhesus iso-immunization, fetal hydrops and intrauterine growth restriction, and procedures such as blood and tissue sampling in the diagnosis of single gene defects.  Career  After the departure of Professor Rodeck, Nicolaides succeeded him as director of the Harris Birthright Research Centre for Fetal Medicine, the first fetal medicine unit in the United Kingdom. His programme of research and teaching made King's College Hospital an important centre of fetal medicine. He holds the position of Professor of Fetal Medicine at King's College London since 1991. He has contributed to over one thousand journal articles and more than thirty books and monographs. Concluding a major part of his work over the years regarding the 11‚Äì13 weeks scan assessment (including measurement of nuchal translucency) he has proposed a new model of pregnancy care \\"Turning the Pyramid of prenatal Care\\". This model shows that it is now possible to assess the risk for most of the relevant complications affecting mother and unborn child if combined screening tests are carried out in a specialist outpatient clinic following protocols published by The Fetal Medicine Foundation. Assessing the risk for pregnancy complications at such an early time in pregnancy might give doctors the chance to reassure patients, and to prevent pre-eclampsia and premature birth, which are major contributors to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

As regent, following the German revolution, he abdicated in the name of his nephew on 12 November 1918, thus ending the rule of the House of Ascania in Anhalt. Early life Prince Aribert was born in W√∂rlitz, Germany. He was the fourth son of Frederick I, Duke of Anhalt, and Princess Antoinette of Saxe-Altenburg. Anhalt was a Sovereign Duchy in the German Empire. Marriage Princess Marie Louise in the 1890s. On 6 July 1891, he married Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. Princess Marie Louise was the daughter of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Helena of the United Kingdom, making her a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. The bride's first cousin, the German Emperor Wilhelm II, had been instrumental in arranging the match. In December 1900, the Duke of Anhalt used his prerogative as reigning Duke to annul the marriage.Royal Couple Separated, New York Times, 14 November 1900. Princess Marie Louise, on an official visit to Canada at the time, immediately returned to England. According to her memoirs, she regarded her marriage vows as binding, so she never remarried. Her memoirs do, however, indicate rage over her marital experience and an obvious dislike of her former husband.The 1903 edition of the Almanach de Gotha states that they were divorced on 13 December 1900 and the contemporary report from the New York Times confirms this.The 1904 edition of Whitaker's Almanack states that \\"her marriage was dissolved by joint request on account of a new family law of that Ducal House\\" which seems to also have been confirmed by the New York Times. Though contemporary sources did not directly suggest it was a cause of his marriage dissolution, a number of contemporaries and subsequent historical accounts suggest Aribert was bisexual or homosexual,Robert Aldrich, The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art and Homosexual Fantasy Routledge, 1993.Gods, Mongrels And Demons by Angus Calder (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2004) and some have suggested an indiscretion with a male attendant was the catalyst for the dissolutionGreg King, Twilight of Splendor: The Court of Queen Victoria During Her Diamond Jubilee Year, John Wiley & Sons, 2007.Marlene A. Eilers suggests that Prince Aribert had been discovered in a compromising position with another man. and that the marriage had never been consummated.Princess Marie Louise's uncle, Edward VII, summed up the situation, saying, \\"Ach, poor Louise, she has returned as she went-- a virgin.\\" However, other sources later suggested he was planning to remarry.Prince Aribert Gives Up His Rights to a Throne, Saint John Daily Sun, 23 January 1904. Certainly, Aribert was known to holiday on Capri, an island with a reputation for attracting homosexual liaisons.Robert Aldrich, The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art and Homosexual Fantasy, London, 1993. Regent When his nephew, Joachim Ernst, succeeded his father as Duke of Anhalt on 13 September 1918, Prince Aribert was appointed regent due to the young age of Joachim Ernst. Aribert's brief regency came to an end on 12 November 1918 when he abdicated in the name of his nephew following the German revolution. The duchy subsequently became the Free State of Anhalt. Later life Prince Aribert died in Munich aged 67 on 24 December 1933.

Early life  Mila Sch√∂n was born Maria Carmen Nutrizio, in Trogir to wealthy Dalmatian Italian aristocratic parents. Interview with Mila Sch√∂n: \\"Mila, al secolo Maria Carmen Nutrizio, nasce infatti nel 1919 a Tra√π, un anno dopo la caduta dell'impero austro- ungarico. Il padre √® farmacista e proprietario terriero, la mamma una Luxardo del maraschino di Lussinpiccolo, il fratello Nino diventer√† giornalista e sar√† fondatore e per lunghi anni direttore del quotidiano milanese ¬´La Notte¬ª. Dalla Dalmazia, che lascia a tre mesi con la famiglia, si trasferisce a Trieste, in una casa del centro storico, dove vive e studia fino a diciott'anni.\\" (Mila is born as \\"Maria Carmen Nutrizio\\" in 1919 in Tra√π, a year after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire...) Her younger brother was the journalist and newspaper editor Setefano Nutrizio. With the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I, Sch√∂n's family lost their estates. The family moved to Italy where Sch√∂n's father managed a pharmacy. During World War II, Mila married Aurelio Sch√∂n, an Austrian precious metals dealer, whom she met in Milan. In the postwar period, Sch√∂n enjoyed a brief return to wealth. She became a client of the most prestigious Parisian couture houses such as Balenciaga and Dior.  Fashion career  Following the failure of her husband's business and the couple's divorce, Mila once again found herself without financial resources. Unable to afford Parisian couture, Sch√∂n paid skilled Milanese seamstresses to copy the latest couture. Other women soon expressed interest in Sch√∂n's designs and in 1958 Sch√∂n and her mother opened a workshop. Sch√∂n had her first show in 1965 and in 1966 she opened a boutique on Via Monte Napoleone, the center of the Milan fashion world. The Via Monte Napoleone shop was decorated with modern furniture by Joe Colombo and Eero Saarinen. In 1965, Sch√∂n showed her collection at the Pitti Palace in Florence along with other major Italian designers. For this show, all of Sch√∂n's fashion were in various shades of violet. Afterwards, The New York Times called her ‚Äúthe shrinking violet of the Italian haute couture‚Äù (1968) and declared she did not ‚Äúmake clothes for shrinking violets\\" (1973). Sch√∂n's work was introduced in the United States in 1967 in Dallas and Houston by Neiman Marcus. In 1969, she designed uniforms for Air Italia. Sch√∂n's men's line and her first pr√™t-√†-porter collection for women appeared in 1971. In 1972, she designed uniforms for Iran Air. Sch√∂n was the first Italian designer to show ready-to-wear in Japan. By the 1980s, Sch√∂n had shops in Italy, Japan, and the United States with offerings that included handbags and shoes, lingerie and watches, perfume, swimwear and eyewear. In 1992, she designed the Italian national team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. In 1993, the brand was taken over by Itochu, a Japanese conglomerate, which sold it to Burani. In 2007, the brand was acquired by an Italian company, Brand Extension. In 2005, Ronna was the Mila Schon ready-to-wear license holder in Japan with retail value of ‚Ç¨30 million.  Style and influence  According to The Telegraph, Sch√∂n's work \\"combined Balenciaga's austerity of cut, Dior's versatility and a dash of Schiaparelli's wit.\\" Her clothing was often geometric and according to Frances D'emilio at The Boston Globe, \\"fashion-world examples of cubism.\\" Sch√∂n signatures included intricate beading and wool coats that eschewed traditional linings in favor of ‚Äúdouble facing‚Äù (two layers of wool stitched together). Her designs borrowed from the modern art she collected - Victor Vasarely, Kenneth Noland, Alexander Calder, Lucio Fontana. Examples of Sch√∂n's work are held by museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Shortly after Sch√∂n's death in 2008, Milan's Palazzo Reale exhibited a retrospective of her work.  Famous clients  Sch√∂n's clients included Jacqueline Kennedy, Lee Radziwill, Marella Agnelli, Farah Diba, Imelda Marcos, and Brooke Astor. At Truman Capote's 1966 black- and-white ball, Marella Agnelli was voted the best-dressed guest in a kaftan embroidered by Sch√∂n's craftswomen. The third in the best-dressed guest contest was Lee Radziwill in a sequined Sch√∂n shift.

Recent studies suggest that Indian culture is trending away from traditional arranged marriages. Fewer marriages are purely arranged without consent and that the majority of surveyed Indian marriages are arranged with consent. The percentage of self-arranged marriages (called love marriages in India) have also increased vastly, particularly in the urban parts of India.David Pilling (June 6, 2014) Review ‚Äì ‚ÄòIndia in Love‚Äô, by Ira Trivedi; ‚ÄòLeftover Women‚Äô, by Leta Hong The Financial Times Wedding industry Weddings are a major business in India.

While the industry is very unorganised with small and medium scale businesses, there are also corporates who are trying to tap this industry. The prime factors because of which this industry has seen more growth are the rise of middle class in India, an overall booming economy and use of social media. It is estimated that a cost Indian Wedding could range between INR 5 Lakhs to INR 5 crores. An Indian, is likely to spend one fifth of his total life time wealth on a wedding. Destination weddings Many Indian celebrities choose destination weddings, and Indians take inspiration from them. Both domestic and international destinations are popular for weddings in India. The destination wedding industry in India is estimated to cross INR 45,000 crore in 2020.

At almost $500,000 each in 1952 dollars, more than three times the price of a standard locomotive of the period, ‚Äî lists the purchase of five Alco RS-3 locomotives, of equivalent power and weight to the MRS-1, at approx. $160,000 each. these were very expensive locomotives. Declared un-needed for wartime operations in about 1970, they were then used on various military bases around the United States, with some serving on the Alaska Railroad. Five locomotives are preserved, three currently in operating condition.  History   Development  Drawing of the locomotive, used to train Army soldiers. The Korean War and the intensification of the Cold War at the beginning of the 1950s caused the USATC to consider what it might need for a new land war in Europe. They came up with a requirement for a locomotive capable of running on the existing tracks of a wide variety of railway systems. Key parts of the specification included adjustable-gauge trucks, compact bodywork to fit restrictive loading gauges and structure gauges, replaceable couplers to fit a variety of systems, and a power output of . The trucks' wheelsets adjusted between standard gauge () and Indian gauge (), which encompasses the vast majority of the broad gauges in use worldwide, including those of the then Soviet Union ( ) and of the Iberian peninsula (Iberian gauge ). The specification was put out to tender, and two companies responded; GM and GE. Both companies were given contracts to produce a batch of thirteen locomotives which would be evaluated by the USATC; the vendor providing the better locomotive would then produce the rest of the required locomotives. Both manufacturers delivered their sample batch in 1952, and after testing the GE locomotives, which were actually produced by Alco as a subcontractor, were declared the winner, and a further batch of 70 Alco MRS-1 locomotives were ordered. No more EMD locomotives were built. As delivered, they were painted in gloss black with white numbering and lettering. They were numbered as 1808‚Äì1820 in US Army service.  Military service  The initial fate of most of the MRS-1 locomotives was to be placed in storage at the USATC's Transportation Materiel Command facility at Marietta, Pennsylvania awaiting a war to use them in; they had not been purchased for peacetime use. These brand-new locomotives, with at most a couple of weeks' actual use, sat preserved until approximately 1970, when the Pentagon concluded that their plans for a future, large-scale land war no longer included the capture and use of the enemy's railway system. Thus the 96 locomotives were redundant for their original purpose. Many of the units were taken out of storage and assigned to various military installations around the country, where locomotives of that size and power were required. Five EMD MRS-1s were sent to the Naval Ammunition Depot in Hawthorne, Nevada (now the Hawthorne Army Depot), but were unsuccessful there and placed into storage.  Cold-weather testing  Unit #1820 was not placed into storage; instead, it was used initially for cold-weather testing. It was broken in on the Belt Railway of Chicago, and in November 1952 the locomotive was shipped to the Canadian National Railway for testing on the Hudson Bay Railway between The Pas and Churchill, Manitoba, where it became the first diesel locomotive to operate on that line. In May 1953, the locomotive returned to the BRC's shops in Chicago where it was stripped down and examined for abnormal wear from the cold weather, which was not found. The locomotive was then used at Fort Eustis for regular service and training. Unit #1809 was also sent for cold-weather testing, in this case to the Alaska Railroad for a 3-year trial period. Shipped back in 1955, its engine was rebored to a larger size and slightly greater power output, then placed into storage. In 1969 it was reactivated and sent to the Vandenberg Air Force Base for service hauling supplies for the proposed Manned Orbiting Laboratory and components for Titan launch vehicles.  European testing  Locomotive #1818 was fitted with European buffers and couplers very soon after delivery and sent to Europe for Army testing and training and secondarily as an EMD demonstrator. It ran extensively on the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) and proved quite successful, although the DB preferred German-designed diesel-hydraulic locomotives. Subsequently, it tested on both SNCF (France) and NMBS/SNCB (Belgium), in the latter case successfully for GM-EMD since the NMBS/SNCB subsequently purchased EMD- licensed NOHAB locomotives.  Alaska Railroad  The 1952-1955 trial of #1809 was not the last appearance of an MRS-1 on Alaska Railroad metals. In 1977, the five MRS-1 locomotives that had been unsuccessfully transferred to the Navy were moved to Alaska to join thirteen of their Alco cousins.  Preserved survivors  Five of the thirteen EMD MRS-1 locomotives built survive in preservation. Of these, two (#1809 and #1820) are on display at the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum Association; #1811 is on display at the U.S. Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, Virginia; #1813 is retired and on display at the Heber Valley Historic Railroad; and #1818 is preserved at the Museum of Alaska Transportation and Industry in Wasilla, Alaska. #1718 is now on display in Wasilla, AlaskaDisplay  Spotting features  Front end of #1811, showing the shutterless grilles and peaked long hood of the EMD locomotives. Back end of an Alco MRS-1, note much rounder cab. Being produced to the same specification, both GE/ALCO and EMD MRS-1s are very similar in appearance and can easily be mistaken; they are both C-C road-switchers that are very low in profile in order to fit within European loading gauges and structure gauges. The major exterior differences are the peaked cab roof and long hood roof on the EMD locomotives, and the radiator intakes on the sides of the long hood end, which have outside shutters on the Alco locomotives. In addition, the short hood is visibly lower than the long hood, thanks to the long hood's peaked roof; on the ALCO units, the two are the same height. The frame side sills are also different; the Alco's are straight from front to rear, while the EMD's step down towards each end of the locomotive.  Naming  For a long while it was believed that \\"MRS-1\\" was an invented railfan name, since it did not appear to have been the official model name in documentation from the USATC or the manufacturers; it was thought to have been derived from \\"Military Railway Service\\", the USATC unit that operated them. However, Stefan Nicola√Ø has found that the designation \\"MRS-1\\" appears on the cover of EMD's operating manual for these locomotives, where it appears as \\"Military Road Switcher MRS-1\\".

It is part of the Lafayette, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Raub was laid out by merchant and livestock- dealer Adams D. Raub on April 8, 1872 near the railroad which had been completed through the area the previous year. Originally consisting of 71 lots, its first house was that of Ira Perkins (which predated the railroad), followed by that of A. Houser in the fall of 1871. At about the same time, Raub gained its first store, a business selling groceries and notions, and in 1873 got a general store operated by Samuel White. A hardware store, drug store, saloon, doctor's office, grain elevator, blacksmith, and various other establishments followed over the next decade. A post office was established at Raub in 1872, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1967. The first organized religious service started about the same time as the laid out, in 1872. The first minister was a Circuit Rider named W.H. Hickman. In 1875, the group that Rev. Hickman, ministered to formed the Raub Evangelical United Brethren Church and commissioned contractor J.H. Bradshaw or Lafayette, IN to build the structure that is still in use today by the Raub United Methodist Church. The Evangelical United Brethren Church joined with the Methodist Church in 1968 and with that merger, the people of the church remained while the name changed slightly Geography Raub is located at in York Township, at the intersection of Indiana State Road 71 and the Kankakee, Beaverville and Southern Railroad. The site is half a mile from the border with Newton County and is surrounded by relatively flat, open farmland.

The Krause Music Store is the last of the 126 buildings designed by Louis Sullivan. In coining the phrase \\"form follows function\\", Sullivan believed that the function of a building gave rise to its form and that the two should work in concert with each other to be beautiful. With its curvilinear plant forms and intricate framing of the picture window, the Chicago-landmark facade of this building is an outgrowth of Sullivan's belief in organic architecture. It was commissioned in 1921 by William P. Krause to serve the dual purpose of a residence and a music shop, at a total cost of $22,000. Krause chose his neighbor, architect William Presto, to design the building. Years earlier, Presto had worked as a draftsman for Louis Sullivan. But by 1921, Sullivan's success had faded, as his designs were no longer in demand. So in a reversal of roles, Sullivan was asked by his former employee to design what would become the building's beautiful green terra cotta fa√ßade. Sullivan, in ill health, living in a rented room and hopelessly insolvent, accepted the offer. Showcasing his genius with terra cotta, Sullivan designed the entire fa√ßade with ornamentation richly detailed in geometric and curvilinear forms of nature. The material for the facade was furnished by the American Terra Cotta Company for $3,770. The building was completed in 1922. The store opened to sell pianos and sheet music, and was a pioneering retailer for the introduction of the radio. With the onset of the Great Depression, William Krause committed suicide in the family's apartment on the second floor. His widow rented and eventually sold the building to a funeral parlor. During the next 60 years, the building functioned as a funeral home, undergoing much neglect and alteration. The terra cotta fa√ßade was acid washed, which ultimately damaged and lightened its color. The basement was converted into a workspace for embalming the dead. On September 20, 1977, the City of Chicago recognized the historic significance of the building and designated the fa√ßade as a Chicago Landmark. Thirteen years later, Scott Elliott opened Klemscott Galleries and restored the front of the building to its original intent. By the turn of the new century, a gift shop called The Museum of Decorative Arts occupied the space. In May 2005, the building was purchased by Pooja and Peter Vukosavich, who painstakingly restored the historic Sullivan fa√ßade and completed a modern renovation of the main floor for their company offices, Studio V Design ‚Äì a marketing communications and design agency. The building is now a serene and elegant space with a meditative \\"zen\\" garden, fostering a dynamic environment for creative design. The renovation has won several awards (including the Driehaus Foundation Award and the AIA award,) and has attracted media publicity. More than 15 feature stories have been written about the building, including features on NPR, Chicago Tribune, and in TimeOut Chicago. In 2006, through the efforts of Peter and Pooja Vukosavich, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. History William P. Krause hired architect William Presto to design a music store with an apartment above. Presto in turn commissioned Sullivan to design the facade. The building was completed in 1922. It was registered as a Chicago Landmark by the City of Chicago in 1977. From roughly 1929 on after Krause closed the music store it was rented and operated as a Funeral Home In 2006, the building was purchased by Studio V Design, who had the facade restored and the interior renovated.Recent history on Chicagoist References External links *Krause Store history at Goethe-Institut Chicago *Listing among Chicago Landmarks *Sullivan at 150 list of images *Art Institute list of Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1922 Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Category:Chicago Landmarks Category:Louis Sullivan buildings Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Chicago Category:Art Nouveau retail buildings ","title":"Krause Music Store"},{"id":"8090379","text":"Carmel Snow, born Carmel White (21 August 1887 - 7 May 1961), was the editor- in-chief of the American edition of Harper's Bazaar from 1934 to 1958; she also served as the chair of that magazine's editorial board. She was famously quoted as saying, \\"Elegance is good taste, plus a dash of daring\\".  History   Early life  She was born in St Justin's, Dalkey, Dublin, to Peter White, a merchant tailor, and Annie Meyne. After her father's death from pneumonia on April 7, 1893, she and her mother Annie moved to America. Her mother eventually became a noted dressmaker for rich New York socialites. In 1903 Carmel attended school at a convent in Brussels; the Soeurs de Sainte- Marie is where she mastered her understanding of French.  Career  In 1921 she was introduced to Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase by Anne Rittenhouse, for whom she had done a favor;Cond√© Nast: The Man and His Empire -- A Biography, by Susan Ronald, published September 2019 by St. Martin's Publishing Group Cond√© Nast subsequently offered her the job of assistant fashion editor. In 1926 she was appointed as fashion editor at Vogue. In 1926, she also married George Palen Snow; wearing a gown of cream white satin trimmed with seed pearls and old Burano lace that had been in her family for many years. She later had three daughters; it was rumored that one of them suffered from schizophrenia, but this diagnosis has not been confirmed. In 1929 her brother Tom White became general manager of the Hearst publishing organization. Though Carmel had promised Cond√© Nast she would not take a job there, she did take a job at Harper's Bazaar. She famously described her goal at Harper's Bazaar as creating a magazine for \\"well-dressed women with well- dressed minds\\". She discovered Martin Munkacsi, and in 1933 and persuaded him to photograph the Harper‚Äôs Bazaar December edition‚Äôs ‚ÄòPalm Beach‚Äô bathing suit editorial. For this editorial, he had the model Lucille Brokaw run toward the camera while he photographed, which was the first instance of a fashion model being photographed in motion. She became editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar in 1934. She hired her art director Alexey Brodovitch on the basis of a 1934 exhibition of his work in graphic design at the Art Directors Club of New York. She described his exhibit as a revelation, mentioning \\"pages that bled beautifully, cropped photographs, typography and design that were bold and interesting\\". She found her fashion editor, Diana Vreeland, after noticing her dancing across a crowded room. In 1947 she exclaimed, \\"It's such a new look!\\", thus coining that phrase in regard to Christian Dior's 1947 collection.Company History at Dior's website Snow died in 1961, while she was working with her long-time collaborator Mary Louis Aswell on her memoir, The World of Carmel Snow. The book was published posthumously.  Legacy  As to why Carmel's reputation faded, while Vreeland's did not, photographer Richard Avedon (quoted in a 2005 biography of Carmel by Penelope Rowlands) said: \\"She was older, right? and she died before stardom was the thing.\\" In 2020, Snow was one of a number of famous Irish people featured on stamps by An Post.

Amyloid, a misfolded and insoluble protein, can become a deposit in the heart‚Äôs atria, valves, or ventricles. These deposits can cause thickening of different sections of the heart, leading to decreased cardiac function. The multisystemic disease was often misdiagnosed, with diagnosis previously occurring after death during the autopsy. However, recent advancements of technologies have increased the diagnosis of the disease. This disease has multiple types including light chain, familial, and senile. One of the most studied types is light chain cardiac amyloidosis. The prognosis depends on the extent of the deposits in the body and the type of amyloidosis.  Types   Light chain (AL-CM) The formation of amyloid is due to these free light chains circulating through the body, caused by abnormal clones of plasma cells overproducing monoclonal immunoglobulin lambda light chains. This type usually affects males over the age of 60 and is rapidly progressive. Diagnostic tests includes serum and urine electrophoresis, laboratory testing for the determination of elevated levels of troponin and BNP, and ECGs showing low QRS voltages.  Familial (ATTRm-CM) This type is caused by mutations of proteins involved in amyloid formation, including transthyretin (TTR), fibrinogen, apolipoprotein A1, or apolipoprotein A2. A common mutation is the TTR gene mutation Val122Ile. This type of amyloidosis can be identified by genetic testingfor protein mutation. Familial amyloidosis symptoms are centered around neuropathological and cardiac problems.  Senile (ATTRwt- CM) This type is considered the wild-type mutation which leads to the development of TTR deposits. It usually affects males over 70 years with the manifestation of carpal tunnel syndrome. This type is often misdiagnosed, however, greater use of cardiac magnetic resonance has increased diagnosing rates.  Symptoms  Amyloid deposition in the heart can cause both diastolic and systolic heart failure. Symptoms of cardiac amyloidosis include dyspnea on exertion, peripheral edema, ascites, thromboembolisms, and symmetric, sensory neuropathy, postural hypotension, periorbital bleeding, pericardial effusion, atrial arrhythmia, first/second degree heart blocks, atrial fibrillation, syncope, elevated neck veins and jugular venous pressure. For patients with light-chain amyloidosis, there is possibility of macroglossia, periorbital bruising, and loss of the third and fourth heart sound.  Cause  The general cause of cardiac amyloidosis is misfolding of a specific protein precursor depending on the amyloidosis type. Protein precursors include immunoglobulin-derived light chains and transthyretin mutations. The misfolding of the protein causes it to have insoluble beta-pleated sheets, creating an amyloid. Amyloid, the aggregation, or clumping, of proteins, is resistant to degradation by the body. Amyloids are mostly fibrils, while also containing a P component, apolipoprotein, collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. The P component, a pentameric protein, stabilizes the fibrils of the amyloid, which reduces their clearance from the body. Deposits of the amyloids can occur through out of the body, including the heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, adrenal glands, and bones. Deposits in the extracellular cardiac space can stiffen the heart, resulting in restriction of the ventricles.  Diagnosis   Echocardiography  Echocardiography is used to provide an assessment of the heart‚Äôs function. Amyloidosis presents with ventricle and valvular thickening, biatrial enlargement, restrictive filling pattern, with normal to mildly reduced systolic function and decreased diastolic filling. Echocardiography, can be used to help physicians with diagnosis, however, it can only be used for the suggesting of the disease not the confirmation, unless it is late stage amyloidosis.  ECG/EKG  ECGs of patients with cardiac amyloidosis usually show a low voltage in the limb leads with unusual, extreme right axis. There is usually a normal P-wave, however, it can be slightly prolonged. For patients with light-chain amyloidosis, the QRS complex pattern is skewed, with poor R-waves of the chest leads. Holter ECGs can be used to identify asymptomatic arrhythmias. EKG changes may be present, showing low voltage and conduction abnormalities like atrioventricular block or sinus node dysfunction.  Laboratory tests  Laboratory tests including urea and creatinine levels, liver enzymes, glucose, thyroid function, full blood count, and clotting tests. The analysis of serum and urine for presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin is also done through immunofixation for detection of the monoclonal band. Presence of the monoclonal band would be consistent with light chain amyloidosis. For light chain amyloidosis, serum immunoglobulin free light chain assay can be used for diagnosis and following of the amyloidosis. In light-chain amyloidosis, a low paraprotein level can be present.  Cardiac biomarkers  Biomarkers of troponins and N-terminal of BNP (NT-proBNP) would be elevated with patients with cardiac amyloidosis.  Biopsies  Extracardiac biopsies of tissues of the kidney, liver, peripheral nerve, or abdominal fat can be used to confirm the presence of amyloid deposits. Amyloid deposits in biopsy samples are confirmed through the use of Congo red dye, which produces a green birefringence when viewed under a polarized light. Sirius red staining or electron microscopy examination can also be done. The determination of the type of amyloid can be done by immunohisto-labeling techniques as well as immunofluorescence staining. For light-chain amyloidosis patients, bone marrow biopsies could be conducted to determine baseline percentage of plasma cells and to rule out multiple myeloma.  Catherization  Right heart catheterization is the test used to test for elevated diastolic ventricular pressures. This test is more invasive and would be performed after inconclusive endomyocardial biopsy samples.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging  Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is capable of measuring the thickness of different areas of the heart. This can be used for quantification of the deposits in the heart. CMR also shows the characterization of myocardial tissue through patterns of gadolinium enhancements. However, none of the CMR technique is able to differentiate ATTR-CM and AL-CM definitely. For AL-CM, 68% of them have symmetrical and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. On the other hand, for ATTR-CM, 79% of them have asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy and 18% of them have symmetrical and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. In T1-weighted imaging, oedema in the heart can be detected with a high T1 signal. Meanwhile, enlargement of heart cells will reduce the T1 signal. Using T1 signal, Extracellular volume (ECV) is useful to determine the degree of amyloid deposition around the heart cells and detect the regression of amyloid deposits after treatment. ECV is higher in ATTR-CM than in AL-CM. In T2-weighted imaging, the T2 signal is increased in acute myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscles), and myocardial infarction (heart attack). T2 signal is also increased in AL-CM and ATTR-CM but the signal is greater in AL- CM before starting chemotherapy. Late gadolinum enhancement (LGE) can determine the severity of deposition of amyloid in heart tissue. The higher the LGE signal, the more severe the heart involvement. It can be divided into three stages: no LGE, subendocardial LGE, and full-thickness (transmural) LGE.  Scintigraphy/radionuclide imaging  Scintigraphy can be used to measure the extent and distribution of the amyloid throughout the body, including the liver, kidney, spleen, and heart. A radiolabelled serum amyloid P component can be administered to a patient intravenously and the P component pools to the amyloid deposit proportional to the size of the deposit. The labelling of the P component can then be pictured by a gamma camera.  Mass spectrometry  Mass spectrometry can be used to determine whether the protein is light- chain or familial amyloidosis by identifying the protein subunit.  Prognosis  Prognosis of cardiac amyloidosis is correlated to the extent of the cardiac dysfunction. Usually the prognosis is not good and aggressive treatments are needed. Worse outcomes have been seen when echocardiography shows left ventricular wall thickness, poor systolic function and severe diastolic dysfunction. For light-chain amyloidosis early detection leads to best possibility of therapies prolonging the period of remission. Prognosis can be made by looking at the levels of cardiac biomarkers troponin I, troponin T, BNP, and NT-proBNP.  Treatments  Treatments differ according to type of amyloidosis present. For light-chain amyloidosis, the use of FLC assays and NT-proBNP levels can be used to monitor the progression of amyloidosis and any response to treatments. Treatments targeting plasma cells to eliminate the misfolded free light chains can be done, such as chemotherapy for amyloidogenic plasma cell dyscrasia. Drugs can be prescribed including midodrine for autonomic neuropathy, amiodarone for patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent arrhythmias, and warfarin used after a cardioembolic episode. Beta-blockers should be avoided due to the usual symptom of hypotension. Treatments are also focused on treating the patient's heart failure. For familial amyloidosis, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers can be prescribed if there is no autonomic neuropathy. There is inconclusive data regarding the use of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators as useful treatments for amyloidosis.

It is commonly grown as an ornamental houseplant. It is one of the three major species involved in creating the widely grown epiphyllum hybrids or \\"epis\\". The others are Disocactus speciosus and Epiphyllum crenatum. Description Stems to 1 m long or more, branching, primary stems to 40 cm long, 6 mm thick, woody and terete at base, flattened at apex; secondary stems flat, lanceolate, acute, margins coarsely crenated or scalloped, obtusely toothed, with terete, stalk- like base, 15‚Äì30 cm long, 2,5‚Äì5 cm wide; areoles nude except for young growth; epidermis green or reddish, nearly smooth. Flowers campanulate, funnel-shaped, diurnal and scentless, 8‚Äì10 cm long, 7‚Äì9 cm wide, produced on year-old branches; pericarpel ovate with a few spreading bracteoles; entire receptacle 2.5‚Äì5 cm long, 7‚Äì10 mm thick; bracteoles more numerous than on the pericarpel, reflexed, green to blackish purple, naked in their axils; outer tepals lanceolate, opening irregularly before flowering, then spreading widely, rose- pink; inner tepals lanceolate-obtuse, more or less erect, pink, paler inside; stamens declinate, as long as the tepals, white; style as long as tepals, white, stigma lobes 5-7. Fruit ellipsoid, 3‚Äì4 cm with low ribs, green at first, later red. Seeds dark brown. Taxonomy A distinct species related to Disocactus ackermannii, D. phyllanthoides has previously been placed in Nopalxochia, but the generic status for that taxon does not have much support. This species, like others of the former Nopalxochia, shows affinity to Weberocereus making the systematics of this group even more complex. Etymology Phyllanthoides (lat.) = similar to phyllanthus. This species was among the first flat-stemmed species to be described, and the name recalls that it is similar to the first described flat-stemmed cactus Cactus phyllanthus today - Epiphyllum phyllanthus. Some authors state that this plant first flowered in the garden of Ch√¢teau de Malmaison, belonging to the late Empress Jos√©phine de Beauharnais. This could explain popular names such as German Empress, Deutsche Kaiserin, Giant Empress, Drottningkaktus (Swedish for Queen's Cactus). This story could be a myth. Distribution and habitat This species is known only from cultivation, or sometimes naturalized. Cultivation Disocactus phyllanthoides is very easily cultivated. The soil should contain plenty of leaf-mould and the plant be given regular water and doses of fertilizer in summer. Best kept relatively cool and dry in winter, . Plants held under proper conditions can produce flowers at least three times a year, but the main flowering period is spring. Under its synonym Nopalxochia phyllanthoides this plant has won the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. History This plant has probably been in cultivation since prehistoric times, by the Indigenous peoples of South America and Mesoamerica. It was called Nopalxochitl by the Aztecs, which explains the former generic name Nopalxochia. As with many of the early described cacti the history is somewhat unclear. Sims and Edwards state that it was discovered by the celebrated travellers Humboldt and Bonpland in April 1801, near the small village of Turbaco, near Cartagena, Colombia. It was reported by Bonpland to have first flowered at Ch√¢teau de Malmaison and at the Botanical Garden of Montpellier, France. However, this species was illustrated much earlier. Both Hern√°ndez (1651) and Plukenet (1691) illustrated the species. Cultivars and hybrids Some cultivar names are in use, but there is no evidence that these differ from the original species - 'Deutsche Kaiserin', 'Empress', 'German Empress'. However, 'Giant Empress' represents a somewhat larger clone with more uniform pink flowers. Disocactus phyllanthoides is frequently used in hybrids. Together with Disocactus speciosus and Epiphyllum crenatum it forms the great trio behind the huge group of orchid cacti known today. Other species have been used, but not to the same extent as these three. Notes References *Anderson, E. F. 2001. The cactus family.

It was available only to subscribers and was priced at a steep 100 francs per year, or $425.61 in today's money.Davis, 50. The magazine, published on fine paper, signed exclusive contracts with seven of Paris' top couture houses ‚Äì Cheruit, Doeuillet, Doucet, Paquin, Poiret, Redfern, and Worth ‚Äì to reproduce in luscious pochoir the designers' latest creations. After World War I, a select group of other design firms were added to the magazine's repertoire, including the houses of Beer, Lanvin, Patou and Martial & Armand. However, the editors' choice of designers was arbitrary, and a number of the era's most prominent couturiers never contributed to the pages of the Gazette du Bon Ton, among them Chanel and Lucile. The magazine's title was derived from the French concept of bon ton, or timeless good taste and refinement. The Gazette du Bon Ton aimed to establish fashion as an art alongside painting, sculpture and drawing. According to the magazine's first editorial: \\"The clothing of a woman is a pleasure for the eye that cannot be judged inferior to the other arts.\\"Davis, 49. To elevate the Gazette's literary status, the publication featured essays on fashion by established writers from other fields, including novelist Marcel Astruc, playwright Henri de Regnier, decorator Claude Roger- Marx, and art historian Jean-Louis Vaudoyer. Their contributions ranged in tone from irreverent to ironic and mocking. Fashion illustrations George Barbier illustration of a Jeanne Paquin gown, published in the March 1914 Gazette The centerpiece of the Gazette was its fashion illustrations.Davis, 56. Each issue featured ten full-page fashion plates (seven depicting couture designs and three inspired by couture but designed solely by the illustrators) printed with the color pochoir technique. It employed many of the most famous Art Deco artists and illustrators of the day, including Etienne Drian, Georges Barbier, Ert√© (Romain de Tirtoff), Paul Iribe, Pierre Brissaud, Andr√© Edouard Marty, Thayaht (Ernesto Michahelles), Georges Lepape, Edouard Garcia Benito, Soeurs David (David Sisters), Pierre Mourgue, Robert Bonfils, Bernard Boutet de Monvel, Maurice Leroy, and Zyg Brunner.

Southern end of Opoutere Beach The name \\"Opoutere\\" means \\"place of floating posts\\". History The first known settlers of the area were the NgƒÅti Hei. They were supplanted by the NgƒÅti Hako in the mid 17th century, but NgƒÅ Puhi raids during the Musket Wars of the early 19th century left the area without a permanent population.King, p. 128. In the 1870s and 1880s, gold prospectors staked claims on quartz outcrops around the Wharekewa Harbour, resulting in half a dozen major gold strikes, and several mines being established in the 1890s. Kauri logging was underway in the 1890s too, and as it petered out, gum-diggers moved in. At the start of the 20th century, there was a settlement of about 50 people near the mouth of the harbour, with a store, a bakery and a post office. An Anglican church was built but was taken over by Ringatu worshippers. As the forest disappeared and the gum industry declined in the 1920s, the village also declined. By the late 1930s, the shops had closed, and the church had been abandoned. Farming and the planting of pines for the Tairua State Forest gradually healed the land.King, pp. 129-130. After World War II, a few families from Auckland and Hamilton built baches beside the harbour, and in the 1950s a holiday store and a camping ground opened.

By that time in the Dakota War of 1862, the Sioux offensive had slowed considerably, and the Minnesota forces were beginning to implement a plan formulated by Governor Alexander Ramsey. Ramsey's plan, implemented by Colonel Henry Hastings Sibley and frontier commander Charles Eugene Flandrau, had the goals to free European-American settlers held captive by the Indians and to \\"exterminate\\" or drive the Dakota \\"forever beyond the borders of the state\\". The Battle of Wood Lake, Minnesota Background In early September, Sibley attempted to negotiate a settlement with Chief Little Crow, thinking that the Dakota must be growing weary of the war. Little Crow returned with an explanation of why the Indians started the war and hinting that he would consider negotiations about some United States prisoners being held captive. Sibley responded by refusing to negotiate and demanding Little Crow's surrender. Little Crow refused to surrender, and the conditions were set for another battle. Sibley's initial expedition from Fort Snelling, which included 1400 troops, took nearly nine days to reach Fort Ridgely. At Fort Ridgely, Sibley delayed still further, to the frustration of settlers and others who wanted swift action against the Indian uprising. Jane Grey Swisshelm, a St. Cloud newspaper editor, wrote, \\"For God's sake put some live man in command of the force against the Sioux & let Sibley have 100 men or thereabout for his undertaker's corpse.\\" The delay was caused, in part, by the lack of experience of the new recruits and the shortage of basic supplies, such as guns, ammunition, and horses. These supplies finally reached Sibley's forces between September 11 and September 14. On September 19, the troops began their march up the Minnesota River valley. Battle The troops camped east of Lone Tree or Battle Lake, a small lake drained by a creek running northeast to the Minnesota River, about five miles north of what is now Echo, Minnesota. Because Sibley's guide thought the lake was Wood Lake (which is about three and a half miles to the west), the battle is misnamed. The Third Minnesota camped along the crest south of the creek, and the sixth Minnesota was next to the small lake. The Seventh Minnesota was at the right rear behind the creek's ravine. All units and the wagon train and artillery were partially enclosed by trenches. Little Crow planned to ambush the soldiers the next morning when they were marching, as, strung out along the road, the troops would be in a long, poorly defended column. In the morning, a few soldiers from the Third Minnesota regiment in several wagons left camp early in search of food from the Upper Sioux Agency near present-day Rock Valle Church. Some of the wagons were not on the road, and were headed straight at some of Little Crow's men as they lay in the grass; they had to get up and fire. This started the fight, and veteran troops from the Third Regiment, recently returned from fighting Confederates in the south, ran to assist their comrades, aided by the Renville Rangers. They advanced about a half mile from the camp until both flanks were threatened. Sibley ordered Lt. Colonel William R. Marshall, with six companies and an artillery piece, to advance and repulse the Indians on the right flank. On the left end of the line, Major Robert N. McLaren led his men around the lake to defeat an attempted flanking attack. The battle lasted about two hours, during which Chief Mankato was killed by a cannonball. The battle was a decisive victory for the United States, with heavy casualties inflicted on the Dakota. For his part in the battle, Sibley received a promotion to Brigadier General. Because of the high losses and the death of Chief Mankato, the battle was the last fought by the Sioux in the uprising. Afterward the influence of the pacifist chiefs increased. They arranged for the release of European Americans held captive by the Sioux and the surrender of many of the Dakota at Camp Release. Units Due to the shortage of troops in Minnesota during the Dakota War of 1862, units were often dispatched in a piecemeal fashion as soon as they could be formed, with some companies and detachments assigned to other regiments. Units involved include: the 3rd Minnesota Infantry, 6th Minnesota Infantry, 7th Minnesota Infantry, 9th Minnesota Infantry, 10th Minnesota Infantry, Citizen Soldier units and Militia including the \\"Renville Rangers\\", and an artillery unit with a 6-pound gun. Battlefield preservation In 2010 the battlefield site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Wood Lake Battlefield Historic District for having state-level significance under the themes Archaeology/Historic- Aboriginal, Archaeology/Historic-Non-Aboriginal, Ethnic Heritage/Native American, and Military. It was nominated as the final engagement of the Dakota War of 1862, a watershed period for the state of Minnesota and the Dakota people, and for embodying early commemoration efforts of 1907‚Äì1910, culminating in the stone monument. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved 240 acres of the Wood Lake battlefield.

The grape can also be found in Argentina, Australia, California, Switzerland and Sicily. Plantings of Mondeuse noire was hit hard during the phylloxera epidemic of the mid to late 19th century which nearly wiped out the vine from eastern France. While the grape recovered slightly in the 20th century, French plantations of Mondeuse noire fell sharply in the 1970s, with just over left in France in 2000. In the early 21st century, it seems the variety has increased somewhat in popularity, as it can give good wines if the planting site is chosen carefully. It was previously suggested that Mondeuse noire was identical to the northern Italian wine grape variety Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso due to the similarity of the wines. In California, many plantings of Mondeuse noire were called Refosco, further adding to the confusion. DNA analysis has shown that this is not the case, and that the two varieties are unrelated. Mondeuse noire is very similar to Muscardin which is found in Southern Rh√¥ne where it is one of the thirteen grape varieties permitted in the wine Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. One difference is that Muscardin has less sensitivity to downy mildew.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 203 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Ampelographers also thought that Mondeuse noire was a color mutation of Mondeuse blanche but DNA evidence has shown that not to be the case with the two varieties having a parent-offspring relationship though it is not yet clear which variety is the parent and which is the offspring. References to Mondeuse usually are to Mondeuse noire rather than to Mondeuse blanche. Mondeuse noire does have a pink-berried color mutant, Mondeuse grise, which was on the verge of extinction until ampelographer Pierre Galet was able to identify vines and have cuttings planted at the Domaine de Vassal conservation vineyard in Montpellier run by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA).J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 649-651, 878 Allen Lane 2012 In Savoie, Mondeuse noire is used in blending with Gamay, Pinot noir and Poulsard where it contributes its dark color and high acid levels to the wine that allow the wines to age well.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 201 Mitchell Beazley 1986 The grape is a permitted variety in the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wines of Bugey in the Ain department and Vin de Savoie. History Mondeuse noire is one of the grape varieties speculated to have been the Allobrogica grape described by Pliny the Elder (pictured) and other ancient Roman writers. There are several theories on the origin of the name Mondeuse. It could be derived from: # the Franco-Proven√ßal terms for pruning, √©monder and monder, which could be a reference to the fact that Mondeuse noire vines begin shedding their leaves before the grapes are harvested; or # the words moduse and moda, which have been historically applied to grape varieties that yield a high proportion of must; or # the French term mal doux, which means \\"badly sweet\\" and may be a reference to the bitter flavors of Mondeuse noire berries when sampled off the vine. To this day, the synonym Maldoux is still associated with Mondeuse noire in wine regions such as Jura in eastern France. Most ampelographers believe that Mondeuse noire is indigenous to the Dauphin√© region of southeastern France in an area that is now part of the Dr√¥me, Hautes-Alpes and Is√®re departments. An early theory, popularized in 1887 by French ampelographer Pierre Tochon, is that Mondeuse noire could be the Ancient Roman grape Allobrogica described by Pliny the Elder and Columella as well as the 2nd century Greek writer Celsus. Ampelographers disagree about the identity of this grape, which grew widely in the land of the Allobroges after whom it is named for, with other theories speculating that the grape was instead the ancestor of Pinot noir or Syrah.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pgs 90 & 369 Simon and Schuster 1989 Wine Pros The Rhone \\" Regional Spotlight Archives. Accessed: May 7th, 2013Wein-Plus \\"Mondeuse noire\\" (Deutsch) (Subscription required) Accessed: May 7th, 2013 The first mention of Mondeuse noire, under the synonym Maldoux, dates to a February 3, 1731 decree from the parliament of Besan√ßon in the Doubs department of the Franche-Comt√©. This decree mandated that all plantings of several grape varieties, including Maldoux, Enfarin√©, Foirard noir, Foirard blanc, Valet noir and Barclan blanc, that were planted after 1702 had to be uprooted and replaced with cereal crops. Under the name Mondeuse noire, the grape was noted in records from 1845 growing in the valley of the Is√®re. Relationship to other grapes Mondeuse noire was once thought to be dark- berried color mutation of Mondeuse blanche, a variety that is best known for being the mother vine to the Rh√¥ne wine grape Syrah. However, in the early 21st century, DNA profiling showed that the two grapes actually had parent- offspring relationship though it is not yet known which grape is the parent and which is the offspring. This relationship makes Mondeuse noire, which is also known under the synonym Grosse Syrah, either a grandparent or half- sibling to Syrah. When Mondeuse noire was first introduced to California in the 19th century, some plantings of the vine were misidentified as the Italian wine grape Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso. This confusion was exacerbated in the 1960s when cuttings of Mondeuse noire labeled as \\"Refosco\\" were taken by the University of California, Davis from a vineyard in Amador County that was established in 1880s and propagated. In 1990s ampelographers began suspecting that these cuttings were not Refosco but rather Mondeuse noire, a fact later confirmed by DNA profiling. Though the exact relationship has not yet been determined, DNA analysis has shown that Mondeuse noire has some connection to Douce noir (pictured) that is grown in Argentina (as Bonarda) and California (as Charbono). In addition to the confusion with Refosco, some plantings of Mondeuse noire in the Russian River Valley were discovered to actually be an offspring of Mondeuse noire, Calzin. This crossing of Mondeuse noire and Zinfandel was created by UC-Davis viticulturist Harold Olmo in 1937 and later developed a white-berried color mutation known as Helena. Also in the late 20th and early 21st century, it was discovered that some of the plantings of Petite Sirah were actually field blends of true Petite Sirah (Durif) as well as several other varieties including Mondeuse noire.Appellation America \\"Mondeuse-Refosco\\" Accessed: May 7th, 2013 Though the exact relationship is not yet known, DNA analysis has also shown that Mondeuse noire has some relationship to the Savoie wine grape Douce noir which is known as Charbono in California and Bonarda in Argentina. Mondeuse grise While Mondeuse noire and Mondeuse blanche are not color mutations of one or the other, DNA evidence has confirmed that, like Pinot gris and Pinot noir, Mondeuse grise was a pink- berried mutation of Mondeuse noire. First described by ampelographer Victor Pulliat in the late 19th century, the vine was thought to be extinct until plantings were identified by Pierre Galet in the 1950s. From these plantings, cuttings were taken and the vine was planted at the Domaine de Vassal conservation vineyard in Montpellier ran by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). Today, outside of the plantings at the INRA's conservation vineyards, the only significant plantings of Mondeuse grise are being propagated as Persagne grise by Michel Grisard in Savoie. Viticulture Mondeuse growing in Arbin, Savoie. Mondeuse noire is a mid- ripening grape variety that tends to thrive on stony vineyard soils that have a high limestone and clay content. The vine can be very vigorous and high yielding which requires the cordons to be pruned short during the winter to keep the vine in check. Among the viticultural hazards that Mondeuse noire is susceptible to include chlorosis, mites, downy and powdery mildew. The vine is also very sensitive to drought conditions which may require irrigation in the vineyard. In Savoie, Mondeuse noire plantings are most often trained in spur pruned systems.Clive Coates An Encyclopedia of the Wines and Domaines of France pgs 31, 569-573 University of California Press; First Printing edition (June 2001) Wine regions A Mondeuse noire wine from 2007 when Bugey was a Vin D√©limit√© de Qualit√© Sup√©rieure (VDQS) classified wine. In 2009, there were 300 hectares (741 acres) of Mondeuse noire planted in France the vast majority of it in the Savoie wine region and the departments of eastern France. Here it is a permitted grape variety in the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) wines of Bugey in the Ain department and Vin de Savoie as well as the vin de pays wines of the region labeled under zonal designation of Vin de Pays d'Allobrogie. In Bugey, Mondeuse noire is permitted to be blended with Gamay and Pinot noir in the red and ros√© wines of the AOC provided that the grapes are harvested to a yield no greater than 45 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 2.4 tonnes/acre) and the finished reaches at least 9% alcohol by volume. Bugey wines can also allow one of the villages in the region along the Rhone and Ain to hyphenate their names along to the AOC designation provided the harvest is restricted to no more than 40 hl/ha and the wine is made above the minimum alcohol level of 9.5%.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pgs 109-110 Firefly Books 2004 The Vin de Savoie AOC covers 1,500 hectares (3,705 acres) northeast of Lyon towards to the Swiss border. Here Mondeuse noire is grown and permitted to be blended with Gamay and Pinot noir in the red and ros√© wines of the AOC. Here yields are restricted to 60 hl/ha (approximately 3.2 tonnes/acre) for the basic AOC and 55 hl/ha for cru classified wine and minimum alcohol levels are 9.5% for basic AOC and 10% for cru classified. While rarely used, Mondeuse noire is also permitted in the sparkling Vin de Savoie Mousseux or semi-sparkling Vin de Savoie P√©tillant wines of the region. Like Pinot noir, which is a red wine grape used in Champagne, Mondeuse noire destined for sparkling wine production would be pressed soon after harvest in order to avoid having the white grape juice tinted by the color phenolics in the skins that are usually leached out by the maceration process.T. Stevenson, ed. The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition) pp. 169‚Äì178 Dorling Kindersley 2005 In Switzerland, the grape is known as Gros Rouge and in the 19th century was the most widely planted red grape variety planted along the shores of Lake Geneva in what is now the Vaud, Valais and Geneva cantons. However, plantings of Mondeuse noire sharply declined throughout the 20th century and by 2009 there were only 4 hectares (10 acres) of the grape scattered throughout the Geneva and Vaud cantons. In the New World In some New World wine regions, such as Australia, Mondeuse noire is co- fermented/blended with Syrah/Shiraz (pictured). Outside of Europe, Mondeuse noire can be found in New World wine region of Australia where producers such as Brown Brothers Milawa Vineyard grow the grape in Victoria. Among Brown Brothers 1.2 hectares (3 acres) of Mondeuse noire are 100 year plus old vines that date back to 1907. Here the variety is often co-fermented with Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Mondeuse noire has been planted in California since at least the 1880s when it was described by Charles Krug as one of the varieties that \\"ambitious winemen\\" were planting along with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Miller Burgundy (likely Pinot Meunier), Crabb Burgundy and Malbec. Today, however, it is difficult to get an accurate count of Mondeuse noire plantings due to the longstanding confusion and mis-identification of plantings as being Refosco (and later confusion with Calzin). While the University of California, Davis officially corrected the error in 2005, the state of California was still counting Mondeuse noire and Refosco plantings as one and the same in their 2008 acreage reports. Some producers, such as Lagier-Meredith in Napa Valley, which is owned by UC-Davis geneticist Carole Meredith, have been able to independently confirm that their plantings of Mondeuse noire as authentic. In the United States, Mondeuse noire is used to produce wines in several American Viticultural Areas including the Central Coast, El Dorado, Santa Cruz Mountains and Santa Maria Valley AVAs in California as well as the Southern Oregon AVAs of the Rogue Valley and Umpqua Valley AVA.  Styles  Master of Wine Clive Coates notes that in the cool alpine vineyards of Savoie (pictured) that Mondeuse noire can sometimes have difficulties ripening which will influence the character of the resulting wine. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Mondeuse noire tends to produce deeply colored and very aromatic wines that can be very tannic but often have good aging potential. Some examples will have \\"bitter cherry bite\\" that can be reminiscent of some Italian styles of wine. In California, the grape is often blended with other varieties such as Syrah and tends to produce dark and spicy wines. Wine expert Oz Clarke notes that one of the reasons why Mondeuse noire was often associated with the Friuli-Venezia Giulia wine grape Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso was likely due to \\"Italianate intensity\\" of the wines produced from the grape with their bitter cherry notes and dark plum fruit.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 138 Harcourt Books 2001 Master of Wine Clive Coates notes that Mondeuse noire sometimes has difficulties fully ripening in the cool alpine climates of Savoie and eastern France which can lead to some examples of the wine being very acidic, tart and lacking fruit. However, wine expert Hugh Johnson believes that Mondeuse noire is often \\"underrated\\" and in Savoie has the potential to produce \\"forthright, fruity reds\\".

She was the second ship launched of the second batch of the class, which had several improvements over the first five ships built. The ship was posted for three years to the Persian Gulf between 2009 and 2012. Pembroke has since been deployed in international exercises and in historic ordnance detection in home waters. Pembroke was the first of the Royal Navy‚Äôs Mine Countermeasures Vessels to be fitted with the Oceanographic Reconnaissance Combat Architecture combat system to replace the previous NAUTIS combat system in early 2020. Design and description The Sandown-class minehunter was designed to complement the existing , by providing a cheaper alternative and specific mine hunting service. The Sandown-class vessels were delivered in two batches, with the first five ships delivered by Vosper Thornycroft to the Royal Navy by November 1994. The company was then awarded the contract for a second batch of seven vessels, of which Pembroke was the second. Ships of the Sandown-class had a hull constructed from glass reinforced plastic, and equipment on-board have a low magnetic signature. While under normal circumstances, the ship operates on diesel engines, when operating near mines she uses an electric drive system. In addition to the bow thrusters, she is also equipped with a Voith Schneider cyclorotor. Further anti-mine equipment includes the Seafox mine disposal system. Ships of the class were each equipped with a single 30mm DS30M Mk2 gun. Construction Pembroke operating in the Persian Gulf, 2011 Pembroke was constructed at the Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton, England. She was used for shock trials on the improvements made to the second batch of Sandown- class minehunters. Operational history Pembroke was posted to Persian Gulf duties in 2009, and spent the following three years conducting operations and exercises there. In 2012, she returned to HMNB Clyde. On the way, she and provided assistance to Delhi Express, a cargo vessel which had lost power while transiting the Gulf of Aden. Pembroke and Middleton protected the ship until it was under way once more, as the area is known for piracy. During the mission to the gulf, the ship had been manned by seven different crews. Upon returning to Faslane, she was placed in dry dock for two months for maintenance. Pembroke underwent a six-month period of support work and upgrades by Babcock International. The upgrades included the installation of the Defence Information Infrastructure, which allows for information sharing across the entire defence network. Further work was taken to upgrade the high pressure air system as well as installing an expanded fire detection system. The work was completed by early 2014, when the ship underwent further sea trials. After a mine was dredged up by a fishing boat in 2014, Pembroke detonated the mine using a Seafox anti-mine drone. In 2015, she spent four months cooperating in operations with ships from the German, Polish, Belgian and Royal Dutch navies.

The village is within the electoral ward of Harrold in the Borough of Bedford. Podington lies around northwest of Bedford and is about east of the county border with Northamptonshire. Nearby there is paintballing and Podington Wyevale Garden Centre can be found in the High Street. Podington is a small picturesque rural village; many of its buildings are stone cottages dating from the 18th century, and some even earlier. Podington was included in the Domesday Book 1086, with a population of 29 households; prominent landowners included Walter of Flanders, Hugh of Flanders and William Peverer. The community was recorded as \\"Podintone\\" and \\"Potintone\\" from the 13th century and later as \\"Puddington\\".British History Online ‚Äì Older spellings ‚Äì 1700s stone cottages Today it is sometimes spelt (or misspelt) \\"Poddington\\". Located around southeast of the village are RAF Podington and Santa Pod Raceway. Hinwick House is found at a crossroads under south of the village. Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed church in Podington. It became a listed building on 13 July 1964. Some surviving architectural elements date back at least to the early 13th century. A 1912 report about the church indicated that it had a chancel, nave, north aisle, south aisle, south porch and west tower. The south arcade of the nave, the north arcade the chancel and tower were all dated to the 13th century.https://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/beds/vol3/pp80-87 Richard Orlebar, the High Sheriff for Bedfordshire and his wife, the culinary writer Diana Astry, were both buried at this church in the 1700s. They had been the owners of Hinwick House. The church's pipe organ was restored by the 92nd Bomb Group Memorial Association. The 92nd group had been stationed at the RAF Podington airfield during WW II and flew nearly 300 operational missions from that base.https://www.warmemorialsonline.org.uk/memorial/262448 Civil parish The civil parish covering Podington also encompasses Hinwick and Farndish; although in the past Farndish had its own civil parish, it experienced depopulation and it was absorbed into the Podington parish. In the past and present the civil parish is usually referred to as \\"Podington and Hinwick\\" but sometimes \\"Podington with Hinwick\\" or just \\"Podington\\". The parish is within the historic Hundred of Willey. Nearby places Less than to the south is the hamlet of Hinwick; the closest nearby villages between 1.5 and 3 km (1 and 2 miles) away include Farndish to the northwest and Wymington to the northeast. Nearby larger settlements include Rushden to the north, Irchester to the northwest and Wollaston to the west, all around away.

Although this kind of subject matter would seem most likely to be studied by fields in the social sciences, this particular subject is most often studied by modern-day geographers. They study it to determine subjective qualities from the public such as personal preference and practical uses of geography like driving directions. Mass media also have a virtually direct effect on a person's mental map of the geographical world.Mental Maps Resource Site The perceived geographical dimensions of a foreign nation (relative to one's own nation) may often be heavily influenced by the amount of time and relative news coverage that the news media may spend covering news events from that foreign region. For instance, a person might perceive a small island to be nearly the size of a continent, merely based on the amount of news coverage that he or she is exposed to on a regular basis.Mental Maps on About.com In psychology, the term names the information maintained in the mind of an organism by means of which it may plan activities, select routes over previously traveled territories, etc. The rapid traversal of a familiar maze depends on this kind of mental map if scents or other markers laid down by the subject are eliminated before the maze is re- run. Background Mental maps are an outcome of the field of behavioral geography. The imagined maps are considered one of the first studies that intersected geographical settings with human action. The most prominent contribution and study of mental maps was in the writings of Kevin Lynch. In The Image of the City, Lynch used simple sketches of maps created from memory of an urban area to reveal five elements of the city; nodes, edges, districts, paths and landmarks. Lynch claimed that ‚ÄúMost often our perception of the city is not sustained, but rather partial, fragmentary, mixed with other concerns. Nearly every sense is in operation, and the image is the composite of them all.‚Äù (Lynch, 1960, p 2.) The creation of a mental map relies on memory as opposed to being copied from a preexisting map or image. In The Image of the City, Lynch asks a participant to create a map as follows: ‚ÄúMake it just as if you were making a rapid description of the city to a stranger, covering all the main features. We don‚Äôt expect an accurate drawing- just a rough sketch.‚Äù (Lynch 1960, p 141) In the field of human geography mental maps have led to an emphasizing of social factors and the use of social methods versus quantitative or positivist methods. Mental maps have often led to revelations regarding social conditions of a particular space or area. Haken and Portugali (2003) developed an information view, which argued that the face of the city is its information . Bin Jiang (2012) argued that the image of the city (or mental map) arises out of the scaling of city artifacts and locations. He addressed that why the image of city can be formed , and he even suggested ways of computing the image of the city, or more precisely the kind of collective image of the city, using increasingly available geographic information such as Flickr and Twitter . Research applications Mental maps have been used in a collection of spatial research. Many studies have been performed that focus on the quality of an environment in terms of feelings such as fear, desire and stress. A study by Matei et al. in 2001 used mental maps to reveal the role of media in shaping urban space in Los Angeles. The study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to process 215 mental maps taken from seven neighborhoods across the city. The results showed that people's fear perceptions in Los Angeles are not associated with high crime rates but are instead associated with a concentration of certain ethnicities in a given area. The mental maps recorded in the study draw attention to these areas of concentrated ethnicities as parts of the urban space to avoid or stay away from. Mental maps have also been used to describe the urban experience of children. In a 2008 study by Olga den Besten mental maps were used to map out the fears and dislikes of children in Berlin and Paris. The study looked into the absence of children in today's cities and the urban environment from a child's perspective of safety, stress and fear. Peter Gould and Rodney White have performed prominent analyses in the book ‚ÄúMental Maps.‚Äù This book is an investigation into people's spatial desires. The book asks of its participants: ‚ÄúSuppose you were suddenly given the chance to choose where you would like to live- an entirely free choice that you could make quite independently of the usual constraints of income or job availability. Where would you choose to go?‚Äù (Gould, 1974, p 15) Gould and White use their findings to create a surface of desire for various areas of the world. The surface of desire is meant to show people's environmental preferences and regional biases. In an experiment done by Edward C. Tolman, the development of a mental map was seen in rats. A rat was placed in a cross shaped maze and allowed to explore it. After this initial exploration, the rat was placed at one arm of the cross and food was placed at the next arm to the immediate right. The rat was conditioned to this layout and learned to turn right at the intersection in order to get to the food. When placed at different arms of the cross maze however, the rat still went in the correct direction to obtain the food because of the initial mental map it had created of the maze. Rather than just deciding to turn right at the intersection no matter what, the rat was able to determine the correct way to the food no matter where in the maze it was placed.Goldstein, B. (2011). Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience--with coglab manual. (3rd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. The idea of mental maps is also used in strategic analysis. David Brewster, an Australian strategic analyst, has applied the concept to strategic conceptions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. He argues that popular mental maps of where regions begin and end can have a significant impact on the strategic behaviour of states.

The band has released seven albums to date. Their debut album Beyond All Sense was released in 1985 and their latest one, Climate Change, in October 2016. The band categorises its music as \\"m√∂rk rock\\", which in English translates to \\"dark rock\\". Stefan Bj√∂rnsh√∂g is the only remaining member from the original line-up. History The story of Destiny took form back in 1980 as bassist Stefan Bj√∂rnsh√∂g first met guitarist Magnus √ñsterman. Together they formed the band Hexagon but soon changed its moniker to Destiny. After recording one demo in 1982 with singer Therese Hanseroth (1964‚Äì2012), they went through some line-up changes and vocalist H√•kan Ring was added to the line-up. A contract was signed with a company called Musik Bolaget and recordings of the debut album Beyond All Sense took place in Studio Bohus, Kung√§lv, in December 1984. The main instrumentation for the album was recorded live during one single day, with only vocals, guitar solos and keyboards added afterwards. The album was later re-recorded with Kristoffer G√∂bel (Falconer) handling vocals and was released in 2005, 20 years after the original album. The band's second album, Atomic Winter, was released on U.S. Metal Records in 1988 with new singer Zenny Hansson joining the group. The record was mixed by Ilbert and Chips from the band Sator. The cover art for the album was created by Derek Riggs, who is otherwise most known for creating a wide array of art for the band Iron Maiden. The album got a lot of positive attention in international hardrock and metal publications, and the band did a promotional tour in Germany and the Benelux area. The recordings of the next album, Nothing Left To Fear, took place during the years 1989‚Äì1990. The band decided to leave U.S. Metal Records after encountering problems concerning the cover art (once again to be created by Derek Riggs) and the recording itself, which the label wanted the band to redo completely. Instead Destiny signed with English label Active Records. The album was remixed and finally released in June 1991. The artwork by Riggs was never used. The same year the band filmed its first video for the song \\"Evil Trinity\\" and toured during the summer as openers for American progressive metalband Savatage. Zenny Hansson left the band during 1992 and without a singer the band's career was temporarily halted. Singer Daniel Heiman (Lost Horizon/Crystal Eyes/Heed) joined for a few months in 1994 but in the end Zenny Hansson (now Zenny Gram) returned to the ranks and, in 1996, recordings of the fourth album, The Undiscovered Country, could finally take place. As the musical climate for hard rock and heavy metal music was quite poor in 1996, the band decided to rest on its laurels and the albums was not released until 1998 when the band signed with label GNW. It received good reviews all over the world but as their new label did not have enough resources to push the album it went largely unnoticed. Prior to the recordings of Future Of The Past the turbulence in the line-up continued. Vocalist Zenny Gram left the ranks again and new guitarists and drummers came and went. Kristoffer G√∂bel (Falconer) joined the band in 2001 and the recording process of the fifth album began in early 2002. In 2003, the band signed with GMR but the release of Future Of The Past, due to various problems with the cover art etc., was delayed until April 2004. A video was also filmed for the song \\"In The Shadow Of The Rainbow\\". In the autumn of the same year the band re-recorded their debut album Beyond All Sense, plus two extra songs, and released it as Beyond All Sense 2005 the following year. The band included a bonus DVD with the release; containing videos, live footage and other extras. Apart from a few shows, opening for ex. Black Sabbath-singer Tony Martin on his tour of Sweden in 2006 for example, nothing much happened during the next few years. Singer Kristoffer G√∂bel also left later that same year. While most of the music for the new album was finished and recorded, the band could not find a new singer, and the years passed by with the band remaining mostly inactive. As 2012, and with it the band's 30th anniversary, drew closer, the idea arose to record and release an album to celebrate it. The original plan had been to re-record Nothing Left To Fear, but now the band decided to keep the six tracks they had already recorded for that and add other tracks. They also finally found their new frontman in Jonas Heidgert and recordings of the anniversary album proceeded towards completion. In the end this idea became the album Climate Change, which was finally released in October 2016, once again on GMR. On top of the six songs mentioned earlier, it also contains one song each from three albums (Atomic Winter, The Undiscovered Country and Future Of The Past) and five previously unrecorded songs from the early days. Currently the band is busy promoting Climate Change. The album has received great reviews from all over the globe and two acclaimed videos for the songs \\"Living Dead\\" and \\"Sabotage\\" have been released.

Beck\\" , bio page at Heart Rhythm Foundation website He was the first American professor of cardiovascular surgery, from 1952 through 1965. Nominee for the Nobel Prize in Medicine, 1952. Family His daughter, Mary Ellen Wohl, became chief of the respiratory diseases division at Children's Hospital Boston, amongst other accomplishments. Biography Beck was born in 1894 in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. He received his medical degree in 1921 from Johns Hopkins, and in 1924 became a surgical resident at the Case Western Reserve University. Beck stayed at Case Western till his death in 1971. In the 1930s, Beck worked on the problem of how to restore circulation to the heart, by developing a technique to implant some pectoral muscle into the pericardium, which provided an additional source of circulation. The technique received great acclaim at the time, though was eventually replaced with more modern techniques. He performed the first \\"Beck I\\" operation (cardiopericardiopexy) in 1935. The Beck II operation came about in the late 1940s, which created a vein graft between the aorta and coronary sinus. In 1947, he performed the first successful defibrillation. He had been operating on a 14-year-old boy with a congenital disorder, but towards the end of the surgery as the boy's chest was being closed, the boy went into cardiac arrest. Beck reopened the chest and tried to massage the heart by hand for approximately 45 minutes, before proceeding to the use of defibrillator which had been designed by Beck and built by his friend James Rand (of the Rand Development Corp.). Beck applied the paddles of the device directly to the boy's heart, and successfully brought the heart out of fibrillation. The boy made a full recovery. Beck is also credited with describing the physiological basis for the signs of acute cardiac tamponade. The medical signs classically associated with acute cardiac tamponade are collectively called Beck's triad.

It occurs on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean on muddy sea beds in quite deep water. In northern Europe it has some importance in fisheries as a food fish. Description Glyptocephalus cynoglossus is a right-eyed flatfish with a small mouth which reaches the forward edge of the lower eye. The mouth contains a single series of small, incisor like teeth. It has a small head which takes up a fifth of the total length with large, open blister-like mucous pits on its blind side Its body is strongly, dorsally compressed and oval in shape. The body is elongated and has a standard length which is 2.5-3.5 times longer than it is broad. The lateral line is relatively straight and runs the length of its body with 110-140 scales. The dorsal fin has 95-120 rays and the anal fin has 85-102 rays, and there is a short, sharp spine pointing forward in front of the anal fin, which is created by an elongated first interhaemal spine of the post-abdominal bone, although this is sometimes so small that it is hidden. The pectoral fin on the eyed side is shorter than the head and the pectoral fins are blackish towards their tips. Almost all of the head and body, apart from the tip of the snout and the lower jaw is covered in smooth scales which make the fish slippery when held. They are brownish grey to greyish brown in colour on their eyed side, with less variation in colour than other flatfish, with the body and fins densely spotted with minute black spots; the median fins become duskier towards their margins. The blind side is white,marked with tiny black dots, although occasionally fish are recorded with the blind side a similar colour to the eyed side. They grow to a maximum size of 60 cm standard length but are normally no more than 40 cm. Distribution Glyptocephalus cynoglossus occurs on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean. In the northeastern Atlantic Ocean it is found from the northernmost part of the Bay of Biscay to the Kattegat and into the westernmost part of the Baltic Sea, northwards along the entire coast of Norway and east in to the Murmansk region of Russia and west to the southern and western coasts of Iceland. In the western North Atlantic their range runs from Newfoundland and Labrador south as far as North Carolina, including the Grand Banks, Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St Lawrence and the Scotian Shelf. Habitat Glyptocephalus cynoglossus adults are found on the continental shelf and upper continental slope with a preference for fine sediments such as clay, muddy sand, and pure mud. They also occur where there are deep holes and channels on the continental shelf. They are benthic and occur in fairly deep water, ranging between 45m and 1460m, but mainly at depths between 184m and 366m. This species prefers temperatures of 2-6 ¬∞C. The juvenile fish cease to be nektonic when they grow to lengths of 5‚Äì6 cm and adopt a benthic habit at shallower depths than the adults. Biology Glyptocephalus cynoglossus feeds on invertebrates and in European waters the main prey items are small crustaceans, starfish, small molluscs, and worms. Fish are rarely taken, if at all, and it does not take baits. Spawning occurs between May and September. and can take place in temperatures ranging from near freezing to 8.8-10 ¬∞C, experiments have demonstrated that the eggs continue to incubate normally in water which is as cold as 7.2C. and as warm as 12.77 ¬∞C. The eggs take around a week to hatch, the newly hatched larvae being about 4.9mm in length with a relatively large yolk sac. As the larvae grow they develop five transverse bands on their body, the reduced yolk and the fin folds. The entire yolk is absorbed when the larva is around 10 days old. At around 40mm the left eye has migrated to the dorsal surface of the head, the migration of the eye is completed at lengths of between 40 and 50 mm. and it is at this point that the young fish adopts a benthic habit. It is a slow growing species, sexual maturity is reached at 3‚Äì4 years and they have a lifespan of up to 14 years, although the maximum reported age is 25 years. Off Norway a sex ratio of 1:1 was found for fish up to the age of 9 years but in older fish this was skewed towards females. Abstract The fecundity of females varies with size with 48,800 eggs borne by a fish of 31 cm in length to 508,300 eggs in one of 60 cm. Fisheries landed Glyptocephalus cynoglossus Glyptocephalus cynoglossus is commercially important as a bycatch and there are fisheries directed at this species, except that it is occasionally targeted in the Skagerrak. It is an important bycatch species in some fisheries which target the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). There was a notable increase in the landings of this species in the 1980s as a result of increased fishing effort by Iceland, Spain, and Norway. The North Sea is where most of the commercial landings in the northeast Atlantic are made and this species is rarely landed in Norway. The FAO reported a total catch for G. cynoglossus in 1999 of 18,969 tonnes, while more recent statistics are that approximately 13,600 tonnes are taken by European fisheries annually with United Kingdom vessels taking around 3,600 tonnes of this total catch. In North America commercial fisheries take around 2,700 tonnes annually. They are caught with bottom trawls using techniques known as \\"demersal bottom trawling\\" and \\"small flatfish (flounders, soles) bottom trawling\\". The IUCN classifies this species as Least Concern, but the damaging bottom trawling methods used to catch it may cause issues, and the large number discarded as bycatch by commercial vessels which are targeting other species is unknown. The flesh is marketed fresh or frozen and is eaten steamed, fried, microwaved and baked.

HMS Inverness Inverness was built by Vosper Thornycroft and launched on 27 February 1990 as one of the 12 ship class of Sandown-class minehunters. Inverness took part in the major joint service Exercise Saif Sareea II in Oman throughout October 2001, and also trained on her way back from the Gulf as part of the overarching Exercise Argonaut 2001 maritime task group. During Exercise Saif Sareea II, Inverness formed part of a minehunter group with her sisters , and the Hunt-class mine countermeasure vessels and , supported by . In 2003, Inverness was one of a number of Royal Navy warships taking part in a multi-national exercises off Scotland, which involved ships and aircraft from a number of the world's navies, including French, German and American units. HMS Inverness was awarded the Freedom of the City of Inverness in 2004. In July 2004, the UK Ministry of Defence announced that as part of the restructuring of the Navy, the three oldest Sandown-class minehunters would be retired by April 2005. Inverness was decommissioned in 2005 and was then laid up awaiting a buyer or disposal. In September 2006, Estonia signed a contract to acquire the three vessels. After refitting in Rosyth Inverness was formally handed over to the Estonian Navy in April 2007, and renamed . EML Sakala (M314) Sakala belongs to the Estonian Mineships Division. She is the fourth vessel of the Estonian Navy Mineships Division and second of three modernized Sandown class minehunters purchased from the Royal Navy. The coat of arms was presented on a ceremony on 24 January 2008 in Scotland. The ship's name comes from an ancient Estonian county Sakala which is today known as Viljandimaa but is often called Sakalamaa. The arms are a black shield which represents the rich soils of Sakala and ethnic Estonian men's clothing. The rose points towards the capital of Sakalamaa. The swords represent Sakala's important role in the Estonian ancient freedom fight and fighting spirit, as silver stands for loyalty. The ship's motto in Latin is \\"In nomine libertatis‚Äù meaning \\"In the name of freedom\\". The coat of arms was designed by Priit Herodes. In December 2018 Sakala arrived at the Babcock site at Rosyth Dockyard for a series of modifications and upgrades, which included the Thales Sonar 2193 navigation system and the Thales M-CUBE command and control system.

It is one of 80 institutes in the Max Planck Society (Max Planck Gesellschaft). Origins The Institute was originally founded by Max Rubner as the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Arbeitsphysiologie, part of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1913. During the First World War the Institute focussed on nutrition and diet, and how ersatz substitutes could be found for particular foodstuffs which were becoming scarce. They worked alongside the Kriegsern√§hrungsamt (War Nutrition Office) to try out different food surrogates both for the military and the civilian population. They also developed aptitude tests for different types of work, such as evaluating distance perception for military drivers, pilots and railway workers. This was further developed to provide a means for selecting artillery officers.  Departments  Mechanistic Cell Biology (Director: Prof. Dr. Andrea Musacchio) The Department of Mechanistic Cell Biology aims to better understand the molecular mechanisms of cell division and their regulation. The main focus is on the key proteins that control the division of chromosomes during mitosis, a process that separates sister chromatids into two identical daughter cells, thereby maintaining chromosome stability. Systemic Cell Biology (Director: Prof. Dr. Philippe Bastiaens) The Department of Systemic Cell Biology studies the regulation of signal transduction processes in cells. These processes control significant cellular functions such as tissue growth (proliferation) or the differentiation of cells into specialized cell types and, thus, determine the fate of each cell. Structural Biochemistry (Director: Prof. Dr.Stefan Raunser) The Department of Structural Biochemistry focuses on structural and functional analyses of biologically and medically relevant membrane proteins and macromolecular complexes. Special attention is given to the investigation into the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction and the infection with bacterial toxins. Furthermore, membrane proteins that play an important role in the synthesis, transport, and homeostasis of cholesterol in the body are examined.  Chemical Biology (Director: Prof. Dr. Herbert Waldmann) Research in the Department of Chemical Biology concentrates on the interface between organic chemistry and biology. By using biochemical and chemical techniques, researchers identify and develop new tools for the investigation of biologically relevant processes and phenomena.

The Municipality was formed in 1962, separating from Teul De Gonzales Ortega. It was originally inhabited by the Caxcan native people. During the 18th century, Spanish settlers started to settle the area. Florencia was a staunch Catholic town during the Cristero rebellion in the 1920s and '30s. This forced many of the families to flee into caves and mountains to escape violence when national forces showed up. The primary economic activity is cattle ranching. The municipality has experienced a drain of population as a result of emigration to bigger cities and abroad to the United States. The town celebrates its patron saints' day on December 8th in honor of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. another important holiday is in August to celebrate its emigrant community abroad. Some typical dishes include: pipian, a type of mole made with pumpkin seeds; gorditas de horno, a type of bread made of corn flour and milk curd. The typical wedding dish is birria with rice and beans. Tequila is the most popular as the town is close to the agave cultivation area. In 2010, the municipality had a total of 4,854 inhabitants, of which 2,406 lived in the municipal seat.

Jack Linkletter hosted the primetime version while Fred Robbins and Dennis James did the daytime show. The announcer was Bill Wendell, with some editions announced by Jerry Damon. The series was produced by Rainbow Productions, otherwise known as Joe Cates Productions, and created by William T. Naud.http://www.boothbayregister.com/article/william-t-naud-game-show- guy/100621 Game play Two players, usually women, competed. The object was to identify an image of a celebrity's face, which was concealed behind a 5√ó5 grid, with the horizontal dimension showing letters and the vertical dimension showing categories. The host announced a category and one of the letters. Then the player in control had to come up with a word or phrase that fit the category. For each acceptable answer given, a piece of the picture connected to the category and letter was revealed. When a signal sounded after four combinations were played (two per player), the game continued with the player choosing a category, then a letter, and finally an answer which fit both criteria. The first player to solve the picture won the game and became champion. In the event that either contestant would make a mistake on the picture, the game automatically went to the opponent. The winner of the game would get the better role in the bonus round and earn the right to play the next game. In the bonus game the winner would secretly choose one of two prizes titled \\"Haggis (luxury items)\\" or \\"Baggis (utilitarian items)\\". If the opponent picked the other package, each contestant won the prizes they chose; if not, then only the champion won whatever she selected. Champions could stay on the program until defeated. Broadcast history The series debuted on June 30, 1958 in both daytime and nighttime. The daytime series was hosted by Fred Robbins from the June 30 debut until he resigned February 6, 1959. The following Monday, Dennis James took over and hosted through the end of the daytime run; James noted on his first episode that he was given no warning that he was taking over the show, forcing him to learn the rules of the game on the fly. The nighttime series ran from June 30 to September 29, 1958 with Linkletter as host. Linkletter refused to do the daytime version so as to not compete with his father Art Linkletter. Episode status The series has not been rerun and is most likely wiped due to network policies at the time. For NBC in particular, this was quite common through 1980. Two episodes are known to exist, both hosted by Jack Linkletter, which are held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.Haggis Baggis at the UCLA Archive James's first episode, likely from the personal library he maintained during his lifetimeDennis James (now managed by his son Brad), also exists.

It is based on Bruce Springsteen's song \\"Highway Patrolman\\". Plot The story, set in 1960s Nebraska, involves two very different brothers: small- town deputy sheriff Joe and criminal Frank Roberts. Before the events of the film, Joe had tried to farm for a living, but was unable to make ends meet, and the bank eventually foreclosed on his property. He became a deputy sheriff as a way to support his young wife, Maria, and child. Joe is a good, conscientious man, but has his own demons to fight with. The opening shot of the film shows a car chase which ends with Joe using his gun to kill a man in self-defense. This results in Joe's conflicted feelings about killing the criminal, as well as the praise and scorn from members of his community from this shooting. Frank, who had been involved with run-ins with the law before going to Vietnam, is described by his father as plagued by \\"restlessness\\". Upon his return to town, he breaks into his brother's home and is nearly shot by Joe's wife. The next day, Frank leaves town without ever stopping by his parents' home. As Joe states in the narration, Frank was correct in his assessment that his parents would understand, as they always seem to when he hurts those who love him. Joe does not hear from his brother for some time, but eventually discovers from their father that he is in jail in another state. He had kept the information quiet to avoid upsetting their mother. Frank is then released from prison and returns to his hometown with his pregnant girlfriend, Dorothy. Joe's and Frank's mother dies and their father commits suicide soon after. Frank tries to settle down and works in construction, but keeps getting into trouble with the law, which puts him in conflict with Joe. When the time comes for Frank's wife to give birth, Frank is in a bar \\"drinking it down,\\" which sparks a confrontation with Joe. After Joe leaves, Frank beats the bartender to death with a chair and drives out of town with Joe on his tail. The film concludes with Joe allowing Frank to escape across the state line.

Joe wears the uniform of a Cass County Sheriff's Deputy in the film. Producer Don Phillips gave Penn's screenplay to two producers, who liked it but felt that the ending was not commercial enough to interest a Hollywood studio. Phillips' friend Thom Mount, who had his own production company and was a big fan of Penn's work, thought that they might interest a studio if they could get a movie star like Tom Cruise interested in appearing in the film. Penn spotted Mortensen in the film Fresh Horses and was drawn to the actor's \\"angularity, a severity to his handsomeness\\", that he thought would be perfect for the role of Frank. Penn and Phillips sent Mortensen the script while he was making Young Guns II in Tucson, Arizona and flew there to meet with him. The actor agreed to star in Penn's film. Penn had Morse and Mortensen rehearse their pivotal scene in a bar for two weeks. The director had a bar set up in a gymnasium which allowed the actors to blow off steam by shooting baskets in between rehearsals. While making the film, Penn felt that Mortensen's \\"inherent kindness\\" was too visible and had him work with a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle club that the director knew in order to acquire an edginess that Penn felt necessary for the character. The Indian Runner is the last film to feature Sandy Dennis, who died six months after it was released to cinemas. In an interview that Viggo Mortensen gave many years after her death, he said that during post-production, Sean Penn cut a scene in which she had eight pages of dialogue.Viggo Mortensen‚Äôs statements about Sandy Dennis In the long scene, Joe and Frank visit their terminally ill mother and their father. During post- production, Sean Penn decided he could improve the movie if Frank seems cold enough to avoid visiting her even though she is dying.Viggo Mortensen‚Äôs statements about Sandy Dennis So he cut the scene.Viggo Mortensen‚Äôs statements about Sandy Dennis Dennis appears in a short scene in which she and her husband, played by Charles Bronson, are visited by Joe only. Quoting Mortensen directly about Dennis, US political strategist Steve Bannon was an executive producer of The Indian Runner. Critical reception The Indian Runner was, for the most part, positively received. It has a 'fresh' rating of 74% on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a positive review, writing that Joe and Frank represent not only the two sides of manhood in society, but also, possibly, the two sides of Sean Penn's own character.

CDN‚Äôs political focus is on Eastern Europe where the organisation works with local partners. CDN also collaborates with organisations and activists from the rest of Europe who want to support a Green Eastern Europe. CDN work is committed to upholding and fostering the values of the Green movement: gender equality, youth active participation in democracy, environmental protection. More elaboration on Green values is written at CDN's platform. History CDN was founded in December 2002 with the goal of developing and supporting green youth organisations in Eastern and South Eastern Europe through cooperation and transfer of knowledge. With an active collaboration and support of FYEG and Green Forum Sweden, CDN is now a network of Young Greens in Eastern Europe which supports the Young Green organisations in the region. CDN is focused on but not limited to study sessions, seminars, summer camps and other regular co-learning activities among constant communication and collaboration between its member and partner organisations. Also differences in methodology of educational work and cultural differences made it clear, that the green ideology in practice has to be differently implemented in Eastern Europe then in the West. The first activity done by CDN was the Summer Camp 2003 \\"Peace and Reconciliation on the Balkan\\" in Jahorina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 80 young participants from all over Europe. Structure and Organisation CDN was built through the structure of the Federation of Young European Greens (FYEG). Both organisations are forming a close connection, mainly because of common educational and political work. Also a lot of CDN member organisations are member of FYEG. CDN is a network build of Member and Partner organisations. Partner organisations are those organisations with seat in a country of the European Union. This distinction aims on focusing the work on organisations from non-EU countries and on showing a signal towards these organisations. It was decided on the Network Meeting 2005 in Bitola, Macedonia. In difference to Member organisations Partner organisations do not have voting right on the network meeting and only one of the member of the CDN Executive Committee can come from a Partner organisation. The highest decision making body of CDN is the Network Meeting. All Partner and Member organisations can send up to two delegates. Each Member organisation has one vote. The CDN Network Meeting decides upon the budget of the last and the coming year, the political and work report of the last year, the activity plan for the coming year and it elects and dismiss the CDN Executive Committee. The CDN Executive Committee is realizing the political and organisational work of CDN between two CDN Network Meetings based on the decisions of the CDN Network Meeting. The CDN Executive Committee consists of 5 members. At least two of them have to be female and only one of them can come from a Partner organisation. The CDN Executive Committee meets at least five times a year. Since mid-2006 CDN has a Gender Working Group. With the support of the CDN Network this Gender Groups on the issue of (un-)equal treatment of women and men in the societies of Eastern Europe. Mainly the question of compatibility of family and career which is a current problem of many young women in Eastern Europe is tackled by this Working Group. Founders The initiative for establishing CDN as a green network in Eastern Europe came from Macedonian Young Greens (DEM - Youth) and Serbian Young Greens supported by the Federation of Young European Greens in December 2002. Since its foundation CDN is sustainable supported by the Green Forum Sweden. Another main source of support is the Council of Europe Youth foundation. The most of the current CDN activities are realized through the Council of Europe \\"All different - All equal\\" campaign. Also from the very beginning CDN takes part in the Youth program of the European Commission, mainly through Exchanges. According to the changes in the Youth program (from 2007 \\"Youth in Action\\") future youth work in Eastern Europe will be closer to its necessaries. Further more activities are realized through the support of the Bundesverwaltungsamt, Referat Internationaler Jugendaustausch im Bereich des Bundesministeriums f√ºr Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend sowie des Ausw√§rtigen Amtes (German Federal office for international youth exchange within the range of the Federal Ministry for family, seniors, women and youth as well as the Foreign Office) as well as Member of the European Parliament and the Federation of Young European Greens. Educational and Political Work The main instrument of the educational work of CDN is the exchange of young people from all over Europe. These exchanges are either seminars (like the Summer Camp) under the support of the Council of Europe Youth Foundation, Youth Exchanges under Youth in action program of the European Commission, Study Sessions in the Budapest Study Center of the Council of Europe and Pilot Projects. Further more the CDN homepage, e-lists and audiovisual materials are used for the exchange of knowledge and competence within the CDN Partner and Member organisations. The activities which are planned for this year: Study Session on Time Management and Youth participation in Budapest, Hungary Seminar on Ethnical minorities, Youth and conflict prevention in Belgrade, Serbia Summer Camp on Green Values for Southern Caucasus, Tbilisi, Beorgia Youth Exchange in Armenia Study Session Photo from the study session \\"The Glass Ceiling Is Not Your Limit\\" in Budapest. CDN organized in partnership with FYEG a study session called \\"The Glass ceiling is not your limit\\" at the European Youth Center in Budapest, Hungary. The study session was focused on the participation of people who identify as women, trans and/or genderqueer in political, business and social structures. This education activity explored and analyzed the patriarchal patterns that prevent equal opportunities based on gender discrimination and to support participants to organize themselves and change their environment in order to remove barriers and enable their participation in political, business and social structures.

It centred around the President of the United States, portrayed by Patty Duke. The series was created by Susan Harris, and was produced by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions. It featured one of the few recurring gay characters in a 1980s television series (Randy, the Secret Service Agent portrayed by Joel Brooks). Synopsis Hail to the Chief is similar in style to the TV sitcom, Soap (from the same producers as this series), in that it was a comedy with open-ended storylines that parodied a soap opera. Patty Duke had the starring role as the President, Julia Mansfield. The show focused on President Mansfield's attempt at balancing her political career with raising her family.

O'Connor of The New York Times wrote in his review: \\"Hail to the Chief features Patty Duke as the first female President of the United States surrounded by assorted misfits in a format that is intended to be, as they like to say, zany and irreverent. This one's sour, to say the least. [...] As for Hail to the Chief, there hasn't been anything so furiously wacky on prime-time television since Soap got a broad cross-section of protest groups worked up almost a decade ago - even before the show went on air. Not surprisingly, both series come out of Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions. Susan Harris is the creator and writer. Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas are the producers. It is perhaps a sign of the times that Hail to the Chief, which goes several kinky steps beyond the outrageousness of Soap, is making its debut without so much as a raised eyebrow, even though the advertisements for the equal opportunity offender promise that you'll say, I thought they couldn't do that on TV.\\" Ratings Hail to the Chief, which featured Patty Duke as the President, got off to a very good start, attracting 32% of the available viewers and winning its time period for the April 9 premiere. But it drew only 24% the following week, 23% for the third episode and 22% for the fourth. Cancellation Hail to the Chief was canceled in May 1985 after seven episodes. ABC continued to air repeats of the series through July 20, 1985.

The building topped out at on 29 October 2007 and completed in 2010. The building bears a resemblance to the original Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, which were destroyed during the September 11th, 2001 attacks. It is the second tallest building in Beijing. It is used for office and hotel space, with retail at its base. The building houses a 278-room 5-star hotel, a 1,600-seat grand ballroom and a carpark. The office space is located on floors 1 to 55. Floors 64 to 77 are occupied by the China World Summit Wing Hotel with a lobby on the 64th floor. Floors 79 to 81 are used for a restaurant and an observation deck. The four elevators that lead directly from the lobby to the 64th floor are Schindler 7000 and reach a maximum speed of 10 metres per second. The building was constructed by the architectural group: Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill - the same company that is credited with the construction of One World Trade Center in New York City, which was constructed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Written by Martin Crump and directed by David Elliott, it was first broadcast on 17 February 1966 on ATV Midlands. Set in the 2060s, the series follows the exploits of International Rescue, an organisation that uses technologically- advanced rescue vehicles to save human life. The main characters are ex- astronaut Jeff Tracy, founder of International Rescue, and his five adult sons, who pilot the organisation's main vehicles: the Thunderbird machines. In \\"The Duchess Assignment\\", International Rescue must save Lady Penelope's friend after she is kidnapped by criminals intent on stealing the fee for her valuable loaned painting. Plot During a visit to France, Lady Penelope (voiced by Sylvia Anderson) finds an old acquaintance ‚Äì Deborah, Duchess of Royston ‚Äì losing heavily at a casino. Unaware that criminals Brophy and Chandler are eavesdropping on the conversation, Deborah tells Penelope that she has been driven to gambling after \\"falling on hard times\\" and has already been forced to part with most of her possessions. Penelope realises that the roulette table has been rigged in the casino's favour but is unable to stop the croupiers running off with Deborah's money and tiara. Parker (voiced by David Graham) engages in a gunfight with the casino owner, who escapes in a car driven by one of the croupiers. Penelope and Parker give chase in FAB 1 but the fraudsters get away. Deborah now has just one valuable possession left: Portrait of a Gazelle, a painting by Braquasso. Penelope tells Jeff Tracy (voiced by Peter Dyneley) of the Duchess's financial problems. Eager to help, Jeff contacts his friend, gazelle-obsessed New York City businessman Wilbur Dandridge III, whose company Gazelle Automations is seeking inspiration for its new logo. Although Deborah is unwilling to sell the painting outright, she agrees to loan it to Dandridge for the same price, and flies from London to New York to supervise the handover in person. Before Hendricks, Dandridge's chauffeur, can collect Deborah and the painting from the airport, he is knocked unconscious by Brophy and Chandler, who plan to steal the Duchess's fee. When Deborah lands, Brophy, posing as Hendricks, drives her to a derelict house in the countryside and ties her to a chair in the basement. He switches on a leaking gas supply and leaves her to suffocate. Meanwhile, Chandler arrives at Gazelle Automations with the painting, introducing himself as the Duchess's representative. He is unaware that Penelope has been tracking Deborah's movements via a homing device hidden inside a St. Christopher brooch that she gave to the Duchess as a present, and that she has warned Dandridge to expect an impostor. Dandridge pulls a gun on Chandler and the crook surrenders, but in doing so throws the painting into the air, where it is grazed by a bullet hastily fired by Dandridge. Penelope contacts Tracy Island to warn International Rescue that Deborah is in danger. Jeff immediately dispatches Scott (voiced by Shane Rimmer) and Virgil (voiced by David Holliday) in Thunderbirds 1 and 2. In the basement, Deborah's attempts to break free cause her to knock a ladder into an old fuse box, which emits sparks that ignite the gas. Scott and Virgil arrive just as an explosion devastates the house. While Virgil tunnels into the burning basement in the Mole, Scott mans the DOMO and uses its powerful suction pads to support the house's sole surviving wall. Having retrieved Deborah, Virgil clears the area before the wall finally collapses and destroys the basement. Penelope visits Deborah as she recovers in hospital. Dandridge arrives with news that Portrait of a Gazelle is irreparably damaged. However, to the amazement of her visitors, Deborah unscrews the handle of her umbrella to reveal the original painting rolled-up inside ‚Äì the canvas that travelled to New York was a copy. Parker enters, announcing that reporters are offering substantial sums for the rights to the Duchess's life story. In addition, all those who have wronged Deborah ‚Äì Brophy, Chandler and the fraudsters running the casino ‚Äì have been arrested and all her stolen money is being returned. Before long, Deborah is back at the casino. Production The puppet that appears as Deborah, Duchess of Royston was based on actress Dame Edith Evans, known for her work on stage as well as in films such as The Importance of Being Earnest (1952). Evans also served as the inspiration for the character's voice, which was ultimately supplied by Ray Barrett when neither Christine Finn nor Sylvia Anderson were able to produce suitable tones during the episode's dialogue recording session. In a 2008 interview, Barrett recalled saying to producer Gerry Anderson \\"Oh, sod this. Gerry, I'll play it\\", to which Anderson replied \\"What?\\" and others gave puzzled looks. The rest of the voice cast found Barrett's imitation of Evans highly amusing.Thunderbirds ‚Äì A Complete Guide to the Classic Series, p. 31. Matt Zimmerman commented, \\"how we got through that episode I'll never know. I never laughed so much in my life.\\" Sylvia Anderson thought the voice \\"marvellously camp\\" and the recording session \\"quite hilarious\\". The shot of Parker pulling his gun on the casino owner uses forced perspective: from the foreground of the shot, a human hand (belonging to a member of the crew wearing a suit sleeve and holding a prop gun) takes aim at the -scale casino owner puppet in the background. Other episodes containing shots of this type include \\"30 Minutes After Noon\\" and \\"The Man from MI.5\\". The carrier aircraft featured in the London Air Display scene was one of the first designs that model-maker Mike Trim contributed to the series.Meddings 1993, p. 72.Thunderbirds ‚Äì A Complete Guide to the Classic Series, p. 51. Trim also designed the DOMO (Demolition and Object Moving Operator) ‚Äì a modified version of the Excavator, which was originally built for \\"Martian Invasion\\" and is also seen in \\"Cry Wolf\\".Thunderbirds ‚Äì A Complete Guide to the Classic Series, p. 49. Effects director Derek Meddings described the DOMO model as \\"practical-looking\\" and \\"very dramatic on-screen\\".Meddings 1993, p. 55. Portrait of a Gazelle and the splatter paintings that appear in the art gallery scene were created by production designer Keith Wilson.Thunderbirds ‚Äì A Complete Guide to the Classic Series, p. 80. One of the paintings visible in the background is an abstract of the character of Alan Tracy, which Wilson originally created for the episode \\"Move ‚Äì And You're Dead\\". The puppet that appears as Wilbur Dandridge III first played Warren Grafton in \\"Brink of Disaster\\". The puppet of the disguised Hood can be seen standing behind Jeff Tracy at the air display. Broadcast and reception \\"The Duchess Assignment\\" received its first UK network broadcast on 6 March 1992 on BBC 2. Critical response Stephen La Rivi√®re, author of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, considers \\"The Duchess Assignment\\" to have an \\"enjoyable, quirky charm\\", praising aspects such as the design of the Duchess puppet and describing the episode in general as \\"one of the most unusual episodes in the Anderson canon\\". Sylvia Anderson commends Martin Crump's script for its integration of action sequences into a plot that is \\"far from futuristic\\". Michael Coldwell, reviewing the episode for Panini UK, praises David Elliott's \\"assured direction\\" and art director Bob Bell's \\"outstanding\\" set design, as well as the script's \\"balance of action, futuristic technology and distinctively quirky characterisation\\". He considers Barrett's impression of Edith Evans \\"in full Lady Bracknell mode\\" to be a \\"fine match\\" for the character of the Duchess. Coldwell suggests that the episode's \\"Ealing Comedy set-up\\" displays Gerry Anderson's \\"affection for English eccentricity\\" and argues that the International Rescue's reduced role shows \\"just how well Lady Penelope and Parker could have carried their own series\\". Marcus Hearn, author of Thunderbirds: The Vault, calls the episode \\"engaging\\". He observes that Deborah is left destitute by her \\"addiction to gambling, which is another of the adult vices that makes a surprise appearance in a series ostensibly aimed at children.\\" Tom Fox of Starburst magazine gives the episode four stars out of five, judging the plot predictable but praising the series' \\"return to detective-style shenanigans\\" after \\"The Perils of Penelope\\" and \\"Vault of Death\\". Mike Fillis, a contributor to Cult Times and Ultimate DVD magazines, applauds the episode's humour and sound effects. He compares the character of the Duchess of Royston to Dame Margaret Rutherford's portrayal of the Duchess of Brighton in the 1963 film The V.I.P.s. John Marriott, in his book Thunderbirds Are Go!, describes the DOMO as \\"entertaining\\" and expresses disappointment that it does not appear in subsequent episodes. Science-fiction writer John Peel notes the auto-nurse featured in the hospital scene, describing it as \\"almost a duplicate\\" of a device later seen in Star Trek: The Original Series.

He was also an early user of the five-string electric bass.  Early life and career  Jimmy Haslip with Eric Marienthal in 2012 Jimmy Haslip at Jazzy Days Festival in Denmark 2018 Born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican immigrants, Spanish was Haslip's first language and he learned to speak English in kindergarten. His father, James Joseph (Jaime) Haslip (1915‚Äì1999) served in the United States Customs Service, beginning as a Merchant Marine until moving to patrolman and eventually deputy commissioner, marrying Jimmy's mother Virginia (Viera) Haslip (1912-2009) in 1937. Haslip moved to Huntington, New York when he was four years old. At age seven, he began playing drums and then moved onto other instruments such as trumpet and tuba until playing bass at age 15. Although he took music lessons and went to a private music school, he considers himself self-taught. He has said that he went to a local music shop with his father and purchased a right-handed bass (he is left-handed) and learned to play it upside down. In an interview with magazine JazzTimes, Haslip said he was surrounded by music as a young boy, from visiting nightclubs and concert venues to his peers. He explains that there was music in his house as well, from his older brother Gabriel listening to classic jazz, his father listening to Latin and orchestra jazz and his aunt listening to \\"sappy stuff like Jerry Vale and Johnny Mathis\\". In high school, Haslip created his first band called Soul Mine with his high school classmates, playing soul music at school dances and parties. In the early 1970s Haslip played with New York glam band Street Punk, he toured alongside musicians, and moved to Los Angeles in 1976, where he played with guitarists Tommy Bolin and Harvey Mandel. in addition to the Yellowjackets, he has worked with Jeff Lorber, Eric Marienthal, Bruce Hornsby, Rita Coolidge, Gino Vannelli, Kiss, Tommy Bolin, Allan Holdsworth, Marilyn Scott, Chaka Khan, Al Jarreau, Donald Fagen, and Anita Baker.

Haslip was a member of the rock group Blackjack from 1979‚Äì1980 with Bruce Kulick, Sandy Gennaro, and Michael Bolton. He also toured with guitarist Allan Holdsworth and drummer Virgil Donati. In 2012, Haslip took a year-long break‚Äîwhich later turned permanent‚Äîfrom the Yellowjackets to spend more time with his family and focus on other musical projects. He was replaced by the son of Jaco Pastorius, Felix. Regarding this topic, he stated: \\"The primary reason for my hiatus is so that I can spend more quality time with my family\\", says Haslip. \\"I spent ten months on the road last year. The break will give me an opportunity to spend more time at home as well as work on other artistic endeavors, such as independently producing projects\\". Haslip adds, \\"This was not a rash decision and there is no animosity by any means. Everybody is still friends and I'm excited for the band and their upcoming plans with Felix\\".  Personal life and interests  In a 1997 article, Haslip mentioned he has been a vegetarian since 1972 and leads a healthy life and enjoys exercising. He also said he has lost some of his music idols and mentors to drugs and violence including fellow bass player Jaco Pastorius. In 2001, Haslip performed at a benefit concert for Union Station Foundation, a Pasadena, California-based organization for the homeless, alongside actors Hector Elizondo and Jeff Goldblum. Haslip also released a compilation album called \\"Junction\\" with all the proceeds going to the Union Station Foundation. Haslip has a wife named Nancy, and they have three children.

It is part of the Lafayette, Indiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Wadena was founded by John Swan and named after Wadena, Minnesota, a town Swan had recently visited and found pleasing. The name derives from an Ojibwa term meaning \\"little round hill\\". The town was situated along a north/south rail line constructed through Benton County in the 1880s, originally operated as the Chicago and Great Southern Railway and later as the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railway, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, and ultimately the Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad which maintained the line until its abandonment in the 1940s. The line was also commonly known as the Coal Road and the Dolly Varden Line. A post office was established at Wadena in 1883, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1919. In the early 20th century, four Wadena residents gained national repute as professional baseball players: * Doc Crandall: A utility pitcher for the New York Giants (1906-1914), he then joined St. Louis in the Federal League (1914-1918), then Los Angeles (Coast League). * Karl Crandall: Played several years for a Memphis, Tennessee, team, played three years with the Indianapolis American Association (1913-1916) and then entered the Coast League. * Arnold Crandall: Pitched for the Buffalo, New York, International League team in 1921. * Cy Williams: outfielder for the Chicago Cubs (1913-1916), then joined the Philadelphia Nationals. Wadena currently consists of several private residences and a defunct Baptist church that burned down. A monument east of town commemorates Wadena School, which served the township's students from 1895 to 1961. Geography Wadena is located at along Benton County Road 600 North in Union Township, midway between 200 East and 300 East. Big Pine Creek Ditch begins in the fields just west of town and flows southeast approximately six miles to Big Pine Creek. Carpenter Creek, which meets the Iroquois River about 14 miles to the north, begins northeast of Wadena. Mount Nebo, the highest point in Benton County, stands a little less than two miles to the east.

In early May 2011, she took part in a mine-clearing operation to secure the waters of Misrata Port, Libya, after mines were dropped by Muammar Gaddafi's forces to prevent aid from being delivered to the besieged city. Brocklesby used her sonar and SeaFox mine disposal system to locate and destroy a mine that was located 1.6 km from the harbour entrance, making the waters safe for aid ships to enter. Brocklesbys commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Jim Byron DSC, said: Brocklesby returned to Portsmouth on 5 July 2011 flying a special version of the Jolly Roger, indicating the successful destruction of a sea-mine.

Chiddingfold is a minehunter, and her purpose is to find and destroy mines, not only in a time of war but also in peacetime. There are about a quarter of a million mines still active from the Second World War alone and they pose a major threat to both military and civilian ships. Chiddingfold is able to enter some types of minefields without the mines detonating. This is because she is made of glass-reinforced plastic and all fixtures within the ship are made of non-ferrous metals, keeping the ship's magnetic signature to the bare minimum. Operational history In January 2012, Chiddingfold began a year-long mid-life upgrade project, including the replacement of her engines, gearboxes, propellers and an upgraded thruster system; she was the first vessel of her class to undergo the refurbishment.

He served in the Roman Curia following a career as a delegate of the Holy See, and was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John XXIII in 1959. Biography Marella was born in Rome to Luigi and Vincenza (n√©e Baldoni) Marella, and studied at the Pontifical Roman Seminary and the La Sapienza University. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Basilio Pompili on 23 February 1918, and then furthered his studies whilst doing pastoral work in Rome until 1922. From 1922 to 1924, Marella was an official of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in the Roman Curia. He was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 9 January 1923, and later Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on 5 April 1933. He then served as auditor (1924‚Äì1933) and charg√© d'affaires (February to September 1933) of the Apostolic Delegation to the United States. On 15 September 1933, Marella was appointed Titular Archbishop of Doclea by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 29 October from Cardinal Pietro Fumasoni Biondi, with Archbishops Carlo Salotti and Domenico Spolverini serving as co-consecrators, at the chapel of the Collegio de Propaganda Fide in Rome.

Marella succeeded Archbishop Angelo Roncalli (the future Pope John XXIII) as Nuncio to France on 15 April 1953. Pope John XXIII created him a cardinal at the consistory held on 14 December 1959 and he received his red biretta in Paris from President Charles de Gaulle.

It consists mainly of Jack Barnett (principal songwriter, vocalist, producer, multi-instrumentalist) and his twin brother George Barnett (drums, electronics, producer, artwork). Multi-instrumentalist Thomas Hein was an active member of TNP between 2006 and 2016; keyboardist Sophie Sleigh-Johnson was active between 2006 and 2010. They have recorded four studio albums: Beat Pyramid (2008), Hidden (2010), Field of Reeds (2013) and Inside the Rose (2019). Their music has been described as \\"blurring the distinction between rock, classical, electronic and experimental\\" and as \\"strikingly modern yet simultaneously timeless.\\" History  Formation and early years  The Barnett brothers grew up in the Essex town of Southend-on-Sea. Their father was a builder and their mother was an art teacher. George and Jack made music together as children with \\"karaoke microphones, old bongos and guitars too large for their tiny hands\\", later focusing on electronic music. They formed the band together with childhood friend Tom Hein, who grew up in nearby Billericay. In a 2008 interview, Jack Barnett said that hip hop acts Wu-Tang Clan, especially member RZA, Timbaland and J Dilla influenced the first album Beat Pyramid. Other inspirations include the electronic music of Aphex Twin and the cartoon series The Smurfs, though Jack Barnett later suggested this was not serious. TNP have been described as \\"falling in the tradition of British outliers that also includes Robert Wyatt, Talk Talk, Bark Psychosis and Scott Walker.\\" Although unusual for a rock group, the band often incorporates the same section of music into different songs as refrains.  Hidden  Before their second album Hidden was released, Barnett revealed that he had been writing music for bassoon and stated that the aim was for a final product where \\"dancehall meets Steve Reich\\". He taught himself musical notation to score the brass and woodwind elements of the album. In a 2010 interview with Jack Barnett, Paul Morley described These New Puritans' new material on Hidden as \\"very 1970, but also quite 1610, 1950, 1979, 1989, 2005 and 2070\\". When performing live during the Hidden era they were often accompanied by a five-piece brass-woodwind ensemble. In 2010 they performed a series of full live performances of Hidden (featuring a brass-woodwind ensemble, Taiko drums, children's choir, three vibraphonists and live Foley techniques) entitled Hidden Live, at venues such as the Barbican Centre (featuring the Britten Sinfonia), the Pompidou Centre and Berghain. In 2010 the song \\"We Want War\\" featured on the Assassin's Creed Brotherhood soundtrack.  Field of Reeds  In a May 2010 interview with C.B.Liddell, Jack Barnett revealed that he was interested in Melanesian music and that he anticipated that the next TNPS album would be \\"quieter.\\" Towards the end of 2012 the band remixed \\"Mutual Core\\" by Bj√∂rk, which featured on the remix album Bastards. In June 2013, they released their third album, Field of Reeds, which featured jazz singer Elisa Rodrigues. The video clip for the single Organ Eternal was directed by Willy Vanderperre and featured the acclaimed Belgian actress Line Pillet. Musically Field of Reeds was described as \\"uncategorizable\\" and as drawing heavily on avant-garde classical composition. For the \\"Fragment Two\\" video, they reunited with Daniel Askill, who'd previously directed \\"We Want War\\". Following Field of Reeds, TNP moved to Berlin and set up in a dilapidated old Soviet broadcasting studio in the industrial suburbs. In 2015 Jack collaborated in the studio with Robert Del Naja of Massive Attack.  Inside The Rose  These New Puritans returned in November 2018 with the song, \\"Into the Fire\\", which was released digitally and as a limited edition flame-coloured 7\\" single. This was followed in January 2019 by an erotic, gender-blurring video for \\"Inside The Rose\\", made in collaboration with photographer Harley Weir, and the announcement of a new album of the same name. Recorded in Essex, London and Berlin, and mixed in Los Angeles, Inside the Rose was described as \\"another creative reinvention\\" and as their most direct and accessible music yet. The album's release was marked with a \\"happening\\" event at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, involving a stage set constructed out of slashed silk hung from scaffolding, designed by George Barnett and artist Freya Don. The support act was performance artist Soojin Chang. After the release of Inside the Rose it was announced that Thomas Hein had departed the group, due to his academic commitments in studying computational neuroscience. In February 2020, they released The Cut (2016-2019), a so-called 'sister album' to Inside the Rose, containing new music begun during the album sessions, orchestral interludes and reworkings, and remixes. It was made available via a limited edition CD, each copy containing hand-cut silk artwork. This was followed by The Blue Door, their third performance at the Barbican Centre in London, which featured large-scale video projections and two scaffold-tower installations draped in gauze, with a band augmented by sopranos, brass, percussion and special guests. In May 2020 during the Covid-19 epidemic, TNP produced two Jigsaw puzzles in collaboration with Harley Weir. All profits from the project were donated to the National Health Service. Once completed, the puzzles displayed codewords which led to a download of a new 4-track EP. Projects TNPS worked with designer Hedi Slimane and recorded the song \\"Navigate, Navigate\\" for the Dior Homme Hiver 2007 show. Both the music and the collection received positive reviews. The band members also took part in an art/dance performance at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris for the after-show of the Stage of the Art. In 2013 Jack Barnett contributed to the Current 93 album I Am the Last of All the Field That Fell: A Channel alongside Nick Cave and Anohni. The next year, TNP soundtracked the first authorised theatrical production of Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World. In 2017 they were commissioned to write a piece to mark the 70th anniversary of Indian independence from the British Empire.

He was a member of Moravian Composer's Club (founded by Jan√°ƒçek) and also founder of the International Schubert Competition for Piano duos in Jesenik (Czech republic), one of the foremost music events of his country. His wife is, besides a pianist, a writer, journalist and critic working for both press and radio. Together they were an important and inspiring couple in Czech musical life. Their life and work is depicted in the book \\"Interviews without piano\\" by Jan Trojan.

Spain declared war on Britain as an ally of France, itself an ally of the American colonies. Most notably, Spanish forces attacked British positions in the south and captured West Florida from Britain in the Siege of Pensacola. This secured the southern route for supplies and closed off the possibility of any British offensive through the western frontier of United States via the Mississippi River. Spain also provided money, supplies and munitions to the American forces. Beginning in 1776, it jointly funded Roderigue Hortalez and Company, a trading company that provided critical military supplies. Spain provided financing for the final Siege of Yorktown in 1781 with a collection of gold and silver in Havana, then Spanish Cuba. Spain was allied with France through the Bourbon Family Compact and the Revolution was an opportunity to confront their common enemy, Great Britain. As the newly appointed Chief Minister of King Charles III of Spain, the Count of Floridablanca wrote in March 1777, \\"the fate of the colonies interests us very much, and we shall do for them everything that circumstances permit\\".Fern√°ndez y Fern√°ndez, p. 4 Aid to the United States: 1776‚Äì1778 Spanish aid was supplied to the new nation through four main routes: from French ports with the funding of Roderigue Hortalez and Company, through the port of New Orleans and up the Mississippi River, from the warehouses in Havana, and from Bilbao, through the Gardoqui family trading company. Spain made loans to the United States to be used to furnish war supplies through the House of Gardoqui, which \\"supplied the patriots with 215 bronze cannon - 30,000 muskets - 30,000 bayonets - 512,314 musket balls - 300,000 pounds of powder - 12,868 grenades - 30,000 uniforms - and 4,000 field tents during the war.\\" Smuggling from New Orleans began in 1776, when General Charles Lee sent two Continental Army (the army of the United States) officers to request supplies from the New Orleans Governor, Luis de Unzaga. Unzaga, concerned about overtly antagonizing the British before the Spanish were prepared for war, agreed to assist the rebels covertly. Unzaga authorized the shipment of desperately needed gunpowder in a transaction brokered by Oliver Pollock, a Patriot (Revolutionary) and financier.Caughey, p. 87 When Bernardo de G√°lvez y Madrid, Count of G√°lvez was appointed Governor of New Orleans in January 1777, he continued and expanded the supply operations.Mitchell, p. 99 As the American diplomat Benjamin Franklin reported from Paris to the Congressional Committee of Secret Correspondence in March 1777, the Spanish court quietly granted the rebels direct admission to the rich, previously restricted port of Havana under most favored nation status. Franklin also noted in the same report that three thousand barrels of gunpowder were waiting in New Orleans, and that the merchants in Bilbao \\"had orders to ship for us such necessaries as we might want.\\"Sparks, 1:201 Declaration of war The Spanish-Portuguese War (1776-77) proved successful. In the First Treaty of San Ildefonso, signed on 1 October 1777, after Mary I of Portugal had dismissed Pombal, Spain won the Banda Oriental (Uruguay), with Colonia del Sacramento, founded by Portugal in 1680.Robert S. Chamberlain, \\"Latin America\\", in An Encyclopedia of History (1948), Revised Edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p. 501. Spain also won the Misiones Orientales. In return, Spain acknowledged that Portuguese territories in Brazil extended far west of the line set in the Treaty of Tordesillas.Robert S. Chamberlain, \\"Latin America\\", in An Encyclopedia of History (1948), Revised Edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, p. 502. In the Treaty of El Pardo, signed 11 March 1778, Spain won Spanish Guinea\\"Spanish Guinea\\", in The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia (1953), New York: Viking. (Equatorial Guinea), which was administered from Buenos Aires in 1778‚Äì1810. With these treaties, Portugal had left the war, and in 1781 Portugal even joined the First League of Armed Neutrality to resist British seizures of cargo from neutral ships.John D. Grainger (2005), The Battle of Yorktown, 1781: A Reassessment, Bognor Regis, West Sussex: Boydell & Brewer, p. 10. The former Spanish Diplomat and then-Ambassador to the French Court, Jer√≥nimo Grimaldi, 1st Duke of Grimaldi, summarized the Spanish position in a letter to Arthur Lee, an American diplomat in Madrid who was trying to persuade the Spanish to declare an open alliance with the fledgling United States. Genoese by birth and a shrewdly calculating politician by nature, Grimaldi demurred, replying, \\"You have considered your own situation, and not ours. The moment is not yet come for us. The war with Portugal ‚Äì France being unprepared, and our cargo ships from South America not having arrived ‚Äì makes it improper for us to declare immediately.\\"Sparks, 1:408 Meanwhile, Grimaldi reassured Lee, stores of clothing and powder were deposited at New Orleans and Havana for the Americans, and further shipments of blankets were being collected at Bilbao. By June 1779 the Spanish had finalized their preparations for war. The British cause seemed to be at a particularly low ebb. The Spanish joined France in the war, implementing the Treaty of Aranjuez signed in April 1779. European waters The main goals of Spain were the recovery of Gibraltar and Menorca from the British, who had owned them since 1704 and to damage British trade through the actions of privateers.Jack Russell, Gibraltar besieged, 1779‚Äì1783 (Heinemann, 1965). The siege of Gibraltar, June 16, 1779 to February 7, 1783, was the longest lasting Spanish action in the war. Despite the larger size of the besieging Franco-Spanish army, at one point numbering 33,000, the British under George Augustus Elliott were able to hold out in the fortress and were resupplied by sea three times. Luis de C√≥rdova y C√≥rdova was unable to prevent Howe's fleet returning home after resupplying Gibraltar in October 1782.Chartrand p.84 The combined Franco-Spanish invasion of Menorca in 1781 met with more success; Menorca surrendered the following year,Chartrand 54‚Äì56 and was restored to Spain after the war, nearly eighty years after it was first captured by the British.Harvey p.532 In 1780 and 1781, Luis de C√≥rdova's fleet captured America-bound British convoys, doing much damage to British military supplies and commerce. West Indies and Gulf Coast In the Caribbean, the main effort was directed to prevent possible British landings in Cuba, remembering the British expedition against Cuba that seized Havana in the Seven Years' War. Other goals included the reconquest of Florida (which the British had divided into West Florida and East Florida in 1763), and the resolution of logging disputes involving the British in Belize. On the mainland, the governor of Spanish Louisiana, Count Bernardo de G√°lvez, led a series of successful offensives against the British forts in the Mississippi Valley, first the attack and capture of Fort Bute at Manchac and then forcing the surrender of Baton Rouge, Natchez and Mobile in 1779 and 1780.Harvey p.413-14 While a hurricane halted an expedition to capture Pensacola, the capital of British West Florida, in 1780, G√°lvez's forces achieved a decisive victory against the British in 1781 at the Battle of Pensacola giving the Spanish control of all of West Florida. This secured the southern route for supplies and closed off the possibility of any British offensive into the western frontier of United States via the Mississippi River. When Spain entered the war, Britain also went on the offensive in the Caribbean, planning an expedition against Spanish Nicaragua. A British attempt to gain a foothold at San Fernando de Omoa was rebuffed in October 1779, and an expedition in 1780 against Fort San Juan in Nicaragua was at first successful, but yellow fever and other tropical diseases wiped out most of the force, which then withdrew and returned to Jamaica. American Midwest Bernardo de G√°lvez, Count of G√°lvez At the end of the Seven Years' War, France gave the Mississippi Valley to her ally Spain, in order to prevent it from coming under British control at the Treaty of Paris (1763). The Spanish assisted the United States in their campaigns in the American Midwest. In January 1778, Virginia Governor Patrick Henry authorized an expedition by George Rogers Clark, who captured the fort at Vincennes and secured the northern region of the Ohio for the rebels. Clark relied on G√°lvez and Oliver Pollock for support to supply his men with weapons and ammunition, and to provide credit for provisions. The credit lines that Pollock established to purchase supplies for Clark were supposed to be backed by the state of Virginia. However, Pollock in turn had to rely on his own personal credit and G√°lvez, who allowed the funds of the Spanish government to be at Pollock's disposal as loans. These funds were usually delivered in the cover of night by G√°lvez's private secretary.Caughey pp. 98‚Äì99 The Spanish garrisons in the Louisiana region repelled attacks from British units and the latter's Indian allies in the Battle of Saint Louis in 1780. A year later, a detachment traveled through present-day Illinois and took Fort St. Joseph, in the modern state of Michigan. This expedition gave Spain some claim to the Northwest Territory, which was thwarted diplomatically by Great Britain and the young United States in their separate peace in the Treaty of Paris (1783). Siege of Yorktown The Spanish also assisted in the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, the critical and final major battle of the North America theater. French General Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, commanding his country's forces in North America, sent a desperate appeal to Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse, the French admiral designated to assist the Colonists, asking him to raise money in the Caribbean to fund the campaign at Yorktown. With the assistance of Spanish agent Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis, the needed cash, over 500,000 in silver pesos, was raised in Havana, Cuba within 24 hours. This money was used to purchase critical supplies for the siege, and to fund payroll for the Continental Army.Dull p. 245 Antilles War After Spain entered the war, Major General John Dalling, the British governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica, proposed in 1780 an expedition to the Spanish province of Nicaragua. The goal was to sail up the San Juan River to Lake Nicaragua and capture the town of Granada, which would effectively cut Spanish America in half as well as provide potential access to the Pacific Ocean. Because of disease and logistical problems, the expedition proved to be a costly debacle.This account follows John Sugden, Nelson: A Dream of Glory, 1758‚Äì1797, ch. VII. The expedition sailed from Jamaica on February 3, 1780, escorted by twenty-one year-old Captain Horatio Nelson in the . Nelson was the highest-ranking officer present, but his authority was limited to naval operations. The overall commander was Captain (local rank of major) John Polson of the 60th Regiment, who recognized young Nelson's abilities and worked closely with him. Polson had about three to four hundred regulars of the 60th and the 79th Regiments, about 300 men of the Loyal Irish Corps raised by Dalling, as well as several hundred local recruits, including blacks and Miskito Indians. After many delays, the expedition began to move up the San Juan River on March 17, 1780. On April 9, Nelson‚Äîin the first hand-to- hand combat of his career‚Äîled an assault which captured a Spanish battery on the island of Bartola on the San Juan River. The siege of Fort San Juan, located five miles (8 km) upstream and manned with about 150 armed defenders and 86 others, began on April 13. Because of poor planning and lost supplies, the British soon began to run low on ammunition for the cannons as well as rations for the men. After the tropical rains started on April 20, men began to sicken and die, probably from malaria and dysentery, and perhaps typhoid fever. Nelson was one of the first to become ill, and he was shipped downriver on April 28, the day before the Spanish surrendered the fort. About 450 British reinforcements arrived on May 15, but the blacks and the Indians abandoned the expedition because of illness and discontent. Although Dalling persisted in trying to gather reinforcements, sickness continued to take a heavy toll, and the expedition was abandoned on November 8, 1780. The Spanish reoccupied the remains of the fort after the British blew it up on departure. In all, more than 2,500 men died, which \\"made the San Juan expedition the costliest British disaster of the entire war.\\"Sugden, p. 173 Following these successes, an unauthorized Spanish force captured the Bahamas in 1782, without battle. In 1783 G√°lvez was preparing to invade Jamaica from Cuba, but these plans were aborted when Britain sued for peace. Peace of Paris The reforms made by Spanish authorities as a result of Spain's poor performance in the Seven Years' War had proved generally successful. As a result, Spain retained Menorca and West Florida in the Treaty of Paris and also regained East Florida. The lands east of the Mississippi, however, were recognized as part of the newly independent United States of America.Richard B. Morris, The Peacemakers: The Great Powers and American Independence (1965). Contribution to victory The involvement of France was decisive in the British defeat. Spain's contribution was important too.Brendan Simms, Three victories and a defeat: the rise and fall of the first British Empire (Hachette UK, 2008). By allying themselves with foreign monarchies, the United States took advantage of the power struggles within European imperialism and essentially formed a united front against Britain. The new nation was eager to spread republicanism, which could threaten Spain's own colonies, and later did so, in the Latin American wars of independence. Nevertheless, Spain maintained a level of support throughout the war in pursuit of its geopolitical interests. Historian Thomas A. Bailey says of Spain: :Although she was attracted by the prospect of a war [against England] for restitution and revenge, she was repelled by the specter of an independent and powerful American republic. Such a new state might reach over the Alleghenies into the Mississippi Valley and grasp territory that Spain wanted for herself. Even worse, it might eventually seize Spain's colonies in the New World.Thomas A. Bailey, A diplomatic history of the American people (10th ed. 1980) p 32-33. Aftermath Spain's involvement in the American Revolutionary War was widely regarded as a successful one. The Spanish took a gamble in entering the war, banking on Great Britain's vulnerability caused by the effort of fighting their rebellious colonists in North America while also conducting a global war on many fronts against a coalition of major powers. This helped Spain gain some relatively easy conquests. North American borders proposed by the Spanish diplomacy near the end of the American Revolutionary War, August 3rd, 1782 The war gave a boost to the kingdom's prestige, which had suffered from the losses to Britain in the Seven Years' War. Even though Spain's single most coveted target, Gibraltar, remained out of its grasp, Spain had more than compensated by recovering Menorca and by reducing the British threat to its colonies in and around the Caribbean, all of which were seen as vital to Spanish interests. Spain was seen to have received tangible results out of the war, especially in contrast to its ally France. The French king had invested huge amounts of manpower, funds and material resources for little clear military or economic gain. France had been left with crippling debts which it struggled to pay off, and which would become one of the major causes of the French Revolution that broke out in 1789. Spain, in comparison, disposed of its debts more easily, partly due to the stunning increases in silver production from the mines in Mexico and Bolivia.In the mid-18th century, production in Mexico increased by about 600%, and by 250% in Peru and Bolivia. Castillero Calvo p. 193 One particular outcome of the war was the manner in which it enhanced the position of Prime Minister Floridablanca, and his government continued to dominate Spanish politics until 1792. Don Diego de Gardoqui, of the Gardoqui trading company that had greatly assisted the rebels during the war, was appointed as Spain's first ambassador to the United States of America in 1784. Gardoqui became well acquainted with George Washington, and marched in the newly elected President Washington's inaugural parade. King Charles III of Spain continued communications with Washington, sending him livestock from Spain that Washington had requested for his farm at Mount Vernon.Ch√°vez p. 2 Notes References      Category:Conflicts in 1779 Category:Conflicts in 1780 Category:Conflicts in 1781 Category:Conflicts in 1782 Category:Conflicts in 1783 Category:18th century in Spain Category:American Revolutionary War Category:Spain‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Military history of Spain Category:Wars involving Great Britain Category:Wars involving Spain Category:1779 in the British Empire Category:1780 in the British Empire Category:1781 in the British Empire Category:1782 in the British Empire Category:1783 in the British Empire Category:1779 in the United States Category:1779 in Spain Category:1780 in the United States Category:1780 in Spain Category:1781 in the United States Category:1781 in Spain Category:1782 in the United States Category:1782 in Spain Category:1783 in the United States Category:1783 in Spain ","title":"Spain and the American Revolutionary War"},{"id":"8091356","text":"Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika, ca. 1930 Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika is a photograph taken by Martin Munk√°csi in 1929 or 1930.

The common type of it is attached to a glass rod and used in chemical laboratories to transfer residues of precipitate or solid on glass surfaces when performing gravimetric analysis. This equipment works well under gentle, delicate and precise requirement. A policeman also comes in various sizes, shapes, and types. Some of them come in one-piece flexible plastic version and some in stainless. The origin of the policeman and its name cannot be identified for sure but some clues led back to the 19th century from the chemist named Carl Remigius Fresenius.  Origin  In chemistry, gravimetric analysis is essential. After precipitating the chemical element of interest, successfully transfer all of the precipitate to the filtration funnel for separation from the supernatant liquid is required. Normally, it used to be done by using a stream of distilled water from a wash bottle. However, such a way is ineffective because dense precipitates may become compacted at the bottom of the beaker or, in the case of light precipitates, may become dispersed on the walls of the beaker. Therefore, by using glass rod to take them off may result in poking a hole in the bottom of the beaker or scratching of the beaker wall. In the 19th century, German chemist, Carl Remigius Fresenius suggest the solution to overcome this problem. Then rubber policeman also recorded in 1910 edition of J. C. Olsen's textbook of quantitative analysis that states \\"...particles adhering to the glass must be removed by means of a so-called policeman, which is made by inserting the end of a rather thick large-sized glass stirring-rod into a short piece of rubber tubing. The rubber tube should be left protruding slightly beyond the end of the glass tube and sealed together with a little bicycle [i.e. rubber] cement.\\" However, it seems that Olsen has nothing to do with the production and sales of this invention. Instead, Oesper Collections catalog indicated that policemen sold by the Henry Heil Company of St. Louis as early as 1904. There is no answer on where the name \\"policeman\\" comes from. However, there are two assumptions: * It is like the police in that it protects the beaker from scratching. * It is like the police in that it gathers up any stray or escaped particles of precipitate on the beaker wall. The second speculation is the most likely the one since in the 1937 edition of Hackh's Chemical Dictionary ‚Äúplatinum policeman,‚Äù defined as ‚Äúa platinum-iridium claw that fits over a glass rod and is used to hold a quantitative filter during ignition,‚Äù which the purpose of the policeman was to prevent the escape of stray filter paper from the crucible during the ignition process that causes thermal updrafts from the burner. Therefore, for policeman, it likely means to prevent the escape of stray precipitate.  Structure  A type of policeman which is made of plastic and is formed into spatula shapes at the ends. A picture of stainless steel laboratory policeman. A policeman is generally a flexible natural-rubber blade attached to a glass rod, which is typically 5 mm to 6 mm diameter and 150 mm long. However, it also comes in various sizes and shapes depending on its uses. The rubber material provides chemical resistance. In some designs, there is no glass rod, but instead the whole item is made of plastic or stainless steel and is shaped into a spatula or scraper shape at the end.  Uses  A policeman can be used for cleaning the inside of glassware, or for getting the last bit of precipitate out of a vessel. Especially in chemical laboratories it is often used to transfer residues of precipitate or solid on glass surfaces when performing the gravimetric analysis. It also used in biological laboratories, to transfer tissue culture cells from a plate to a suspension. It feature is to prevent the glass rod from scratching or breaking glassware.

He dons the classic yellow and blue costume from the comics. Wolverine is also in love with Jean Grey, who is Cyclops's girlfriend for most of the series. This and Cyclops's decision to leave Morph and Beast behind following an attack from the Sentinels led to Wolverine feeling a great resentment for the X-Men leader. Wolverine remembers very little about his past. One difference from the comic version is that Wolverine actually sees the claws when they first come out his hands. :Powers: Wolverine's mutation is an incredible regenerative power and heightened senses. His claws and adamantium endoskeleton are not part of his original mutant abilities and are, while considered unique, an artificial addition. * Rogue (Anna Marie) (voiced by Lenore Zann) - In her green and yellow costume with a brown leather jacket, Rogue is virtually interchangeable with her early 1990s comic incarnation. She speaks in a sassy, Southern accent and generally has an attitude of good- humored irreverence. Her impressive powers of super-strength, invulnerability, and flight are frequently demonstrated early in the series. Also in line with the comics are her deeply harbored, usually hidden feelings of isolation. Gambit flirts with her, and though she feels equally attracted to him, her fear of harming him with her powers causes her to push him away, thus driving her to further solitary, brooding soul-searching. She was the adopted daughter of Mystique, after running away from home when her father rejected her for being a mutant. Like her comic book counterpart, she put her boyfriend, Cody, in a coma when her powers manifested during her first kiss. Rogue is shown in her mid-twenties. :Powers: Rogue has the ability to draw a human's energy from a mere touch, causing unconsciousness and, in some cases, elongated comas. This allows her to absorb their psyche, skills, and powers for a short time. Her powers of super strength and flight are revealed to have come from Ms. Marvel, who Rogue nearly killed by draining so much of her energy that the absorbed powers became permanent, and Ms. Marvel fell into an almost permanent coma. * Storm (Ororo Monroe) (voiced by Iona Morris, then Alison Sealy-Smith) - Storm's origins are very true to the comics. She was orphaned at an early age and spent her childhood living on the streets, often stealing in order to survive. Early in the series, Storm defeats Callisto to become the leader of the Morlocks, a position she later gives back to Calisto. Like her comic counterpart, Storm is claustrophobic. :Powers: Storm is capable of controlling weather of all varieties to a large array of manifestations. She can also use bursts of wind to enable her power of flight. * Beast (Henry \\"Hank\\" McCoy) (voiced by George Buza) - Beast is seen as the gentle giant. Beast is kind- hearted and highly intellectual. In the episode \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" (season 2), Beast's other side is shown when he falls in love with a young blind patient whom he is treating, and the Friends of Humanity kidnap her. Beast shows his natural aggression when invading their headquarters. :Powers: His natural powers are supreme agility and super strength. An experiment to remove him of his powers, however, caused him to grow blue fur and mutated his body to that somewhat akin to a gorilla. * Gambit (Remy Lebeau) (voiced by Chris Potter from 1992‚Äì1996, then by Tony Daniels in 1997) - Gambit is originally from New Orleans and speaks with a thick Cajun accent. He is seen as the very laid-back character. Gambit's past is explored in the episode \\"X-ternally Yours\\" (season 2), revealing his affiliation with the civil war between thieves and assassins. As mentioned before, he is seen flirting with Rogue whenever possible. They both share an obscure relationship, but as the series goes on their relationship develops into a more mature, loving one. While outwardly Gambit is shown to have a cocky bravado personality, several episodes reveal that he has a deeper side, showing his strong sense of honor and devout loyalty to those he considers family (namely the X-Men), like in the episode \\"Sanctuary (part 2),\\" when Gambit sacrifices himself in order to let the others escape. In the episode \\"X-ternally Yours,\\" Remy passes up the chance to wipe out the Assassins Guild and chooses the X-Men over any ties he has to either guild, telling Belladonna Boudreaux, \\"I am not Thief, or Assassin. I am an X-Man, and I'm never coming back.\\" Gambit is shown to be in his late twenties. :Powers: Gambit is able to charge any object with a kinetic energy and, when thrown, these objects become explosive. His durable strength and agility possibly also come from this ability, charging himself with a potent amount of energy to undertake many tasks that normal humans cannot perform. * Jubilee (Jubilation Lee) (voiced by Alyson Court) - The youngest of the X-Men, Jubilee was an orphan and was sent to many foster homes. In the first episode, she was captured by the Mutant Control Agency as bait to draw out the X-Men, but was rescued at the end. Jubilee is a some-what carefree girl, who wants to be seen as an adult in the eyes of her counterparts. Nevertheless, the team appreciate her involvement in the team. Her costume is the same as it is the comics. She is always trying to get involved in the missions, but is always excluded because of her age, much to her frustration. :Powers: Jubilee is able to create pyro-kinetic sparks from her hands, which she can use to strike things from a distance, or disable machinery from her very touch. * Jean Grey (voiced by Catherine Disher) - As in the comics, Jean Grey is the heart-and-soul figure of the X-Men, usually seen at the side of Professor X as he discusses the purposes and activities of the team. Her costume is basically the one introduced in Uncanny X-Men #281 when she joined Storm's Gold Team, although her red hair is tied-back rather than hanging loose. Her and Scott's relationship is deepened and she takes on a central role in the \\"Phoenix Saga.\\" Unlike most adaptations, in the animated series Jean was Xavier's first student. :Powers: Jean has mastered the skill of telekinesis, the ability to move objects with her mind, along with some minor telepathic skill similar to Professor X. Her powers manifest themselves and she is possessed by the entity, the Phoenix, whose powers expand upon her own, but eventually turn to evil when she refuses to leave the sensation of being in a human body. * Professor X (Charles Xavier) (voiced by Cedric Smith) - The founder of the X-Men, Professor Xavier is very similar to his comic book counterpart, and his friendship with Magneto is explored in greater detail during this series. Differing slightly from the comics, Xavier is stated to have lost the use of his legs \\"battling Magneto\\" in the episode \\"Sanctuary\\" and instead of a wheelchair, he uses an orange hover-chair. He is shown at times to be a lonely man, such as when he sadly watches Moira MacTaggart and Banshee embrace. In the \\"Phoenix Saga,\\" Xavier's dark side briefly manifests itself. :Powers: Charles possesses supremely powerful telepathic abilities, allowing him to see peoples' minds or to control their thoughts or actions, though the latter is not used for his personal gain. * Morph (Kevin Sydney) (voiced by Ron Ruben) - Morph was a member of the X-Men and a close friend of Wolverine who was apparently killed in the first episode by Sentinels. He reappeared as a recurring villain in the second season where it was revealed that Mr. Sinister had saved and brainwashed him. Until the end of the season, through constant assurance from his teammates, Morph helped battle Sinister. Professor X finally removed his implants, but he needed much more rehabilitation. Morph later appeared in the episode \\"Courage,\\" and in the series finale, \\"Graduation Day,\\" where he briefly appeared as Professor X, while the professor was sick and dying due to an illness. He appeared to have more of his past snickering humor, probably suggesting that he was now mentally healthy and back on the team, this time permanently. :Powers: Morph is capable of shape-shifting and assuming any form that he comes across. This power is not limited to humanoid life forms. Morph can change into animal forms as well. X-Factor X-Factor is the mutant U.S. government group that was most notably seen in the episode \\"Cold Comfort\\". However, X-Factor also could be seen briefly in episodes Sanctuary Parts 1 and 2. * Forge - Forge guest-starred in a few episodes. He is unique in that he has two separate roles in the show: in the present, he is the leader of the government-run X-Factor team; and in the future, he leads the mutant team called Xavier's Security Enforcers, that resists the Sentinels in the \\"Days of Future Past\\" time-line. :Powers: Intuitive genius for invention; and he has a cyborg leg. * Polaris (Lorna Dane) - Polaris appears in the episode \\"Cold Comfort\\" as a member of X-Factor. Polaris had been a member of the X-Men alongside her boyfriend, Iceman, though they eventually left to pursue a normal life. However, Polaris left Iceman and became a member of X-Factor and fell in love with Havok. She was later featured in the second part of the episode \\"Phalanx Covenant,\\" in which she aided Beast, Magneto, Forge, Warlock, and Amelia Voght in their battle with the extraterrestrial Phalanx Empire. :Powers: Manipulates electromagnetism allowing her to fly, create force- fields, project concussive blasts, and manipulate ferrous materials. * Havok (Alex Summers) - Havok guest-starred in the episode \\"Cold Comfort\\" as a member of X-Factor and was revealed to be romantically involved with Iceman's ex- girlfriend, Lorna Dane. In the episode, X-Factor fights against the X-Men for a \\"friendly skirmish,\\" as Forge puts it. It is never openly stated in the animated series that Cyclops and Havok are indeed long-lost brothers, though Alex's existence is revealed in flashbacks. When the two meet they develop an instant rivalry and neither brother's powers affect the other; a fact which is also seen in the comics. Havok is also seen in Season 1's Days of Future Past Part 2, when Bishop tells the X-Men what will happen in the future. :Powers: Metabolizes cosmic radiation and discharges it as energy blasts from his arms. * Quicksilver (Pietro Maximoff) (voiced by Paul Haddad) - Quicksilver guest- starred in a couple of episodes. His most noticeable appearance is in the story, \\"Family Ties\\" (season 4), where along with his sister, the Scarlet Witch, they look for their long-lost father and discover that he is Magneto. :Powers: Superhuman speed. * Multiple Man (James Madrox) - Multiple Man appeared in the episode \\"Cold Comfort\\" as a member of X-Factor. :Powers: Self- duplication by absorbing kinetic energy. * Wolfsbane (Rahne Sinclair) - Wolfsbane appears in the episode \\"Cold Comfort\\" as a member of X-Factor. :Powers: Morphs into a werewolf-like humanoid. * Strong Guy (Guido Carosella) - Strong Guy appears in the episode \\"Cold Comfort\\" as a member of X-Factor. :Powers: Rechannels kinetic energy into physical strength. Alpha Flight Alpha Flight was seen in the episode \\"Repo Man.\\" Vindicator (who had renamed himself Guardian in the comics) and the Canadian Alpha Flight capture Wolverine. The Canadian government demand their project back. Either he joins their team as originally planned or they repossess his indestructible, adamantium skeleton. * Vindicator (James MacDonald Hudson) (voiced by Barry Flatman) - Alpha Flight's leader. :Powers: Powered suit allows him to fly, fire energy blasts, and create a personal force field. * Shaman (Michael Twoyoungmen) (voiced by Don Francks) * Puck (Eugene Milton Judd) (voiced by Don Francks) :Powers: Superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, and durability. * Snowbird (Narya) (voiced by Melissa Sue Anderson) :Powers: Flight, and can morph into Arctic creatures. * Northstar (Jean Paul Beaubier) (voiced by Rene Lemieux) - Northstar appeared in the episodes \\"Slave Island\\" and \\"Repo Man.\\" Though he didn't have any speaking role in \\"Slave Island,\\" the episode \\"Repo Man\\" proved to hold true to the character's origins as his trademark French Canadian accent was present. In \\"Slave Island\\" Jean-Paul was a hostage/prisoner of the island nation of Genosha. He, along with many other mutants, provided slave labor for the government using their mutant skills for such tasks as building dams and the like. They wore special collars that restricted them from using their powers to escape and slept in prison-like cells. They eventually escaped Genosha with the help of the X-Men. In \\"Repo Man,\\" Northstar is shown as part of the Canadian special forces team Alpha Flight, which tries to convince former member Wolverine to re-join. :Powers: Flight, generates a flash of blinding light when slapping hands with his sister, Aurora. * Aurora (Jeanne Marie Beaubier) (voiced by Jennifer Dale) - Aurora appeared in the episodes \\"Slave Island\\" and \\"Repo Man.\\" :Powers: Flight, generates a flash of blinding light when slapping hands with her brother, Northstar. * Sasquatch (Dr. Walter Langowski) (voiced by Harvey Aitken) :Powers: Scientific genius. Massive, ape-like, furred form with superhuman strength, healing factor, and sharp claws and teeth. * Dr. Heather Hudson (voiced by Rebecca Jenkins) Xavier's Security Enforcers/The Resistance (in Bishop's future) * Forge - This aged version of Forge leads Xavier's Security Enforcers, a team that resists the Sentinels in the \\"Days of Future Past\\" time-line, alongside Wolverine, Bishop, and Shard. In the altered time-line, created when Fitzroy murdered Professor X, Forge is a servant of Master Mold, having been transformed into a cyborg like his counterpart in the Age of Apocalypse. * Wolverine - This aged version of Wolverine is also a member of the Resistance. * Bishop (Lucas Bishop) (voiced by Philip Akin) - Bishop was originally a \\"tracker,\\" a mutant collaborating with the Sentinels hunting down members of the Resistance until he was deemed unnecessary and marked for extermination, which prompted him to join the Resistance. He travels back in time to stop the assassination of Senator Kelly and prevent the \\"Days of Future Past\\" time-line from occurring (with Bishop assuming Kate Pryde's role from the comic version of this tale). While he succeeds in saving Kelly, in his time-line there is no recollection of the X-Men as they have all died. Later, he returns to stop the spread of Apocalypse's techno-organic virus; however, he also faces resistance from Cable, who knows the virus is necessary as it will also lead to the salvation of mutant-kind. He also shows up in some more episodes, where he and his sister travel back in time to stop Fitzroy from killing Xavier in the past, causing constant war between mutants and humans in the X-Men's time, and his time changes into one in which the few surviving mutants are known only as slaves to Master Mold. They eventually manage to save Xavier, but Bishop gets trapped in the Axis of Time when Apocalypse throws him out of time. He eventually saves the entire time-line when he accidentally begins to free the psychics in the \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" arc. :Powers: Absorbs energy directed towards him and releases it as energy blasts from his hands. * Shard (Shard Bishop) (voiced by Kay Tremblay) - Shard is seen in the \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" storyline, when Bishop is sucked back into the time-portal and trapped in the Axis of Time. Shard comes back to the present to find her brother; however, when she gets to the present, she sees Mr. Sinister trying to kidnap Professor X, so she stops him. Then she asks the X-Men for help in finding her brother. :Powers: Energy blasts from her hands. * Malcolm and Randall are shown as members in Shard's video recordings. Clan Chosen (in Cable's future) * Cable (Nathan Christopher Summers) (voiced by Lawrence Bayne) - Cable's first two appearances were in \\"Slave Island\\" and \\"The Cure.\\" There was no explanation or back story given for how he time-traveled into the past, although his mission involved stopping the production of collars that could inhibit mutant powers. Later, he appeared in the two-part episode \\"Time Fugitives,\\" where Cable travels back in time to stop Bishop from preventing the outbreak of Apocalypse's techno-virus. \\"Time Fugitives\\" and \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" established Cable's back story as waging a war along with his comrades, Clan Chosen, against Apocalypse, as well as the New Canaanite government, in a dystopian future. It is also hinted that he is the son of Cyclops and Jean Grey. :Powers: Telepathy and telekinesis, a techno-organic arm, and \\"bodyslide\\" (a form of teleportation). * Genesis (Tyler Dayspring) - Genesis is Cable's son. He appears as a child in \\"Time Fugitives,\\" when Cable's time-line starts restoring itself, so Cable goes back in time to stop Bishop from preventing the plague. Later he appeared as a young adult in \\"Beyond Good and Evil,\\" when the Clan Chosen go to destroy Apocalypse's Lazarus Chamber in 3999 A.D. * Hope, Dawnsilk, Boak, and Garrison Kane were also shown as Clan Chosen members, but only Hope had a speaking part. They appeared in cameos working alongside Cable and Tyler. X-Terminators (unnamed) * Rusty, Boom-Boom, Wiz-Kid, and Skids (voiced by Tara Strong) were featured as orphans in the episode \\"No Mutant is an Island\\". The episode mostly focused on Cyclops and Rusty. In the episode, Cyclops, still in mourning after Jean Grey's \\"death,\\" quits the X-Men and returns to his orphanage home in Nebraska. A man known as Killgrave offered to help and adopted the orphans seemingly out of charity. In reality, Killgrave, a mutant himself with telepathic abilities, wanted to use the children to make them his army to destroy all humans in the world so that mutants are accepted. Killgrave brainwashes the four and uses them to storm the governor's mansion so he can make the governor his mind-controlled slave. Scott was able to snap Rusty and the others out of Killgrave's hypnotic brainwashing in the end and save the mutant children. Later, Cyclops returns to the mansion and he and the other X-Men discover that Jean Grey has not perished after all. :Powers: Rusty: Fire generation. Skids: Anti-friction personal force-field. Boom-Boom: Creates balls of explosive energy. Wiz-Kid: Techno-morphic abilities. The Mutant Resistance (in the Xavier-less time-line) This was the team created by Magneto in an alternate time-line after Xavier was killed in early life in the episode \\"One Man's Worth,\\" in which the humans and mutants were locked in a war. * Magneto - The leader. * Wolverine * Storm * Beast * Nurse Jean Grey * Dr. Summers (only mentioned) * Rogue * Mimic * Nightcrawler (Age of Apocalypse version) * Morph (Age of Apocalypse version) * Jason Wyngarde * Sabretooth (Age of Apocalypse version) * Holocaust (Age of Apocalypse version) * Mr. Sinister * Colossus (Age of Apocalypse version) * Wild Child (Age of Apocalypse version) * Gambit (in this version Gambit has lost an arm) * Joanna Cargill * Blob * Caliban * Callisto * Masque * Pyro * Banshee (Age of Apocalypse version) * Polaris (Age of Apocalypse version) * Blink (Age of Apocalypse version) * Angel (Age of Apocalypse version) * Sunfire (Shiro Yoshida) (Age of Apocalypse version) * An unknown, blue-haired, red-masked mutant with force-field projection. Guest allies * Moira MacTaggert (voiced by Lally Cadeau) - A former love of Professor X and a researcher of mutation. * Banshee (Sean Cassidy) (voiced by Jeremy Ratchford) - Moira's fianc√©. :Powers: Superhuman scream. * Phoenix - The entire saga of the Phoenix is retold in the third season, divided into the five-part \\"Phoenix Saga,\\" in which Jean acquires the power of the Phoenix; the battle for the M'Kraan crystal; the \\"Dark Phoenix Saga,\\" showcasing the battle with the Hellfire Club; the Phoenix's transformation into Dark Phoenix; and the battle to decide Jean's fate. These particular episodes are as close as the cartoon came to directly duplicating the comic book storyline. The \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" is so accurate to the original stories that the episodes have the additional credit, \\"Based on stories by Chris Claremont.\\" Rather than destroying an inhabited system, the animated story had her destroy a deserted system and only disable the attacking Shi'ar cruiser. After the Phoenix left Jean's body, Jean retained her original powers, whereas in the aborted comic book ending, she would have been lobotomized by the Shi'ar and lost them entirely. * Colossus (Piotr Rasputin) (voiced by Rick Bennett, then by Robert Cait) - The X-Men help Colossus when he was framed for crimes committed by Juggernaut. He later comes to them when Omega Red is attacking Russia. :Powers: Transforms his body into organic steel, obtaining superhuman strength. * Magik (Illyana Rasputin) (voiced by Tara Strong) - Illyana appeared the episode \\"Red Dawn.\\" In that episode, she and her mother remained by the side of Colossus and the X-Men as they fought the newly released Omega Red. She also appeared in one of Cable's visions of the altered timestream in \\"Time Fugitives,\\" in which, without the antibodies developed to fight Apocalypse's techno-organic virus, many mutants, like Illyana, developed harmful mutations which killed them. * Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) (voiced by Adrian Hough) - Nightcrawler only made guest appearances in the episodes \\"Nightcrawler\\" and \\"Bloodlines\\" and never joined the X-Men. He was shown first in an episode that featured him as a monk in a Swiss abbey, persecuted by one of his superiors and the townspeople who believed him to be a demon. Gambit, Rogue, and Wolverine helped him through his trials. The second episode reveals his origins as the birth son of Mystique, discovered by his foster-sister Rogue. In the end, after a discussion, Mystique apparently dies to save both of them from Graydon Creed. :Powers: Teleportation, sticks to surfaces, night vision, blends into shadows. * Psylocke (Elizabeth Braddock) - Psylocke appears during the fourth season in the episode \\"The Promise of Apocalypse\\" (Beyond Good and Evil, part 2), and in the episode \\"End and Beginning\\" (Beyond Good and Evil, part 4). In this storyline, Psylocke appears to be a lone warrior who practices theft with a cause (a-la-Robin Hood). She comes into direct conflict with Archangel and, later on, Sabretooth and Mystique. She refers to her brother as fighting to help mutants, but does not name him as Captain Britain. :Powers: Fires psychic \\"knives\\" from distance. * Angel/Archangel (Warren Worthington III) (voiced by Stephen Ouimette) - Archangel's origin was retold in the series, where Apocalypse creates the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Angel goes to a scientist who claims he can \\"cure\\" mutancy, but it is actually Mystique, a servant of Apocalypse, who turns him into Death. Angel also makes a cameo appearance in the \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" four-part episode, and as one of the original X-Men in two flashbacks. In this version, he overcomes the Death persona to become Archangel thanks to Rogue, who saps the evil that lay within him when she touches him. :Powers: Winged flight, later razor sharp metallic wings and feathers. * Silver Fox - Silver Fox appeared in the episode \\"Weapon X, Lies & Videotape.\\" In this continuity, she too was a member of Team X, Wolverine's lover, and a victim of the Weapon X program. * Maverick (Christoph Nord) - Maverick appeared in the episode \\"Weapon X, Lies & Videotape,\\" searching for answers about his past and his involvement with Weapon X, teaming with Wolverine, Sabretooth, and Silver Fox. In the episode \\"Whatever It Takes,\\" the character Morph briefly turns into Maverick to taunt Wolverine. Maverick also appears in flashbacks that depict himself and Wolverine battling Omega Red, though that memory could be one of Weapon X's implanted memories. * Darkstar (Laynia Petrovna) (voiced by Elizabeth Rukavina) - Darkstar guest- starred in the episode \\"Red Dawn.\\" She is initially the mutant enforcer for a group of rogue Russian generals seeking to reestablish the Soviet Union with the aid of Omega Red. After witnessing the crimes committed by Omega Red, Darkstar rebels against the generals and sides with the X-Men and Colossus. :Powers: Darkforce manipulation allows her to fly and create force fields. * Lilandra Neramani (voiced by Camilla Scott) - Lilandra appeared in the third season. There, she sought the help of Professor X and his X-Men to help her defeat her evil brother D'Ken. During the short time they shared alone, Xavier and Lilandra quickly fell in love and eventually managed to defeat D'Ken. When Lilandra became the new heir to the Shi'ar throne, she kissed and thanked Xavier for his help and even offered for him to join her, but he declined to do this for as long as there is no peace between mankind and mutants. Lilandra left, but eventually returned to Earth when Xavier became deadly ill in the final episode of the show. She took Xavier to the Shi'ar Empire with her so they could heal him. :Powers: Minor telepathy. * Sage Araki * Longshot (voiced by Rod Wilson) - Longshot appeared in the episodes \\"Mojovision\\" and \\"Longshot.\\" In the animated series, it seemed to indicate that he might have a relationship with Spiral. :Powers: Probability manipulation (good luck), superhuman agility. * Ka-Zar (voiced by Robert Bockstael) and Zabu - Ka-Zar and Zabu appeared in the episodes \\"Reunion\\" (parts 1 and 2) and \\"Savage Land, Strange Heart\\" (parts 1 and 2). * Warlock (voiced by David Corban) - Warlock's history was altered so that he actually came to Earth in an effort to escape his destiny of merging with the Phalanx. * Cannonball (Sam Guthrie) - Cannonball made a small appearance along with his sister, Paige Guthrie, in the episode \\"Hidden Agenda.\\" The episode featured Rogue learning about a new mutant that had been making waves in her hometown. However, his appearance caused a violation of continuity, as Cannonball had already made a cameo appearance (on a video screen in \\"Night of the Sentinels\\"), already employing his mutant power, and with blond hair. * Captain America (Steve Rogers) (voiced by Lawrence Bayne) - Captain America appears in the episode \\"Old Soldiers.\\" He is an American agent, sent along with the Canadian Wolverine, to rescue a scientist kidnapped by the Red Skull and the Nazis. He is present in the episode only in Wolverine's flashbacks. He was also seen in a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Red Dawn.\\" * Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) (voiced by Roscoe Handford) - Ms. Marvel appears in the episode \\"A Rogue's Tale\\" (season 2), where she haunts Rogue for stealing her powers and leaving her in a coma. * Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff) (voiced by Susan Roman) - The Scarlet Witch made both a guest and a cameo appearance. She appeared in the episode \\"Family Ties\\" along with Quicksilver, when they tried to find out who their father is. * Mjnari - Mjnari appeared in the episode \\"Whatever It Takes.\\" In this episode, the Shadow King takes over Mjnari's body, so Rogue and Storm go to Africa to help him. Mjnari is a mutant with superhuman speed. He is also Storm's godson. * Darrell Tanaka - A mutant healer in the mutant town of Skull Mesa. Like Mjnari, he's an original character. * Iceman (Bobby Drake) (voiced by Denis Akiyama) - Bobby Drake appeared as a former member of the team, who quit due to disagreements with Xavier. He appears in the episode \\"Cold Comfort\\" where he gets Jubilee's help to rescue his girlfriend Lorna Dane (not called Polaris here) from a government facility which is housing the X-Factor. In the series, Iceman was seen in many flashbacks which include \\"Sanctuary (part 1)\\" and \\"Xavier Remembers.\\" * Dazzler (Alison Blaire) - Dazzler appeared as a background character in \\"Mojovision,\\" and was central to the plot of \\"Dark Phoenix Saga (part 1): Dazzled.\\" * Senator Robert Kelly (voiced by Len Carlson) - Robert Kelly ran for president on an anti-mutant campaign during the beginning of the show's first season. Kelly came to befriend the X-Men and support mutants shortly after his election as president in the season's final episode, after the X-Men had rescued him from both an assassination attempt by Mystique and an attempted brainwashing by Master Mold. In the first episode of season two, Kelly took office as president, spoke out in support of mutants, and made his first presidential act an official pardoning of Beast, who had been unfairly arrested early in season one. These actions led Kelly's former, anti-mutant supporters to feel betrayed by him and create the public anti- mutant backlash that pervaded the entire second season of the show. In the third through fifth seasons of the series, President Kelly had a low profile. He remained friendly with the X-Men through the show's end, working with them to confront global mutant threats such as Magneto building an armed, inhabitable, mutants-only asteroid in space during the fourth season. * Cody Robbins - Cody was the first boy Rogue ever kissed, triggering her consciousness-stealing powers and putting him into a coma. He makes a flashback appearance in the episode \\"A Rogue's Tale\\" (season 2) and plays a supporting role in the episode \\"Love in Vain\\" (season 4) where he join forces with the Brood Colony to reunite with Rogue. Neutral characters * Magneto (Eric Magnus Lensherr) (voiced by David Hemblen) - In the series, Magneto first appears in the third and fourth episodes as an antagonist where he launches nuclear missiles, but the X-Men stop it. Then he seeks to destroy a factory, but the X-Men stop him again. In the first season's finale, he helps the X-Men defeat the Master Mold and the Sentinels. He appears in nearly every episode in the second season, in which he and Professor Xavier are powerless and travel throughout the Savage Land. At the end of that season, the X-Men save them from Mr. Sinister, and they regain their powers. In the fourth season, he allies with Apocalypse but turns on him after discovering his true agenda and aids the X-Men in defeating him. Later, he constructs Asteroid M as a safe haven for mutants, but his dream is ruined by the fanatical Fabian Cortez. Broken, he secludes himself in the arctic and does not care about the possible destruction of life on Earth until he receives news from Beast, Forge, Mr. Sinister, and Amelia Voght that the Phalanx has kidnapped his son, Quicksilver, in the second part of the two-part, fifth season premiere. He teams up with them to defeat the Phalanx and saves everyone he had captured. By the end of the series, he has gathered up an entire army of rebellious mutants, but receives news from Wolverine, Cyclops, and Jean Grey that Professor X is dying. * The External (Candra) - Candra is featured in the episode \\"X-Ternally Yours.\\" In it, she has the same connection to the Thieves and Assassins as in the comics, offering them great power and protection in exchange for a decennial tithing, with those who broke the tithe punished greatly. She is not as inherently evil as her comic's counterpart, more focused on the tithe and ensuring its sanctity than any real criminal behavior. She eventually turns on the Assassins, after they threaten the tithe by kidnapping the Thieves' \\"chosen one\\" Bobby (Gambit's brother), and replacing their tithe with an empty box. She is represented as an African- American spirit, as opposed to a Caucasian mutant. Neutral groups Starjammers The Starjammers appear in the five-part episode \\"Phoenix Saga\\" led by Corsair (Major Christopher Summers). In this episode, the Starjammers attack the X-Men and steal the M'Kraan crystal, in hopes of trading in to D'Ken so that Corsair can get close enough to kill him. However, D'Ken knew of their plan and tricked them, and got hold of the M'Kraan crystal. The Starjammers have to work with the X-Men to destroy D'Ken. Hepzibah, Raza Longknife, Ch'od, and Cr+eee were the Starjammers that appeared along with Corsair in the \\"Phoenix Saga.\\" Corsair later appeared in the episode \\"Orphan's End.\\" In this episode, Corsair is on the run from a corrupt Shi'ar police officer, and he comes to Earth. Later, he finds out that Cyclops is his son. They first accuse Storm of being a traitor and attack her, but after she explains to the Starjammers what was happening they help Cyclops and Corsair defeat the officer. Acolytes The Acolytes appear in the \\"Sanctuary\\" storyline, in which Magneto builds Asteroid M as a safe haven for all mutants to live away from the hatred of baseline humans. The Acolytes, led by Fabian Cortez, aid Magneto in the liberation of the Genoshan mutant slaves from the hands of the Genoshan magistrates. After Cortez betrays Magneto and he is believed to have been killed by the X-Men, the Acolytes pledge their loyalty to Cortez, though they turn on him after he is later exposed. * Fabian Cortez (voiced by Lawrence Bayne) - Cortez appeared in the two-part episode \\"Sanctuary.\\" As in the comic's storyline, Cortez was the leader of the Acolytes and used his powers to bolster Magneto's own abilities. However, Cortez's extreme anti-human sentiments led him to betray Magneto. Cortez threatened to destroy Earth but was stopped by the X-Men and Amelia Voght, who revealed Cortez's betrayal to the other Acolytes and the entire mutant population of Asteroid M. He was trapped in Asteroid M by a vengeful Magneto, but was rescued from its destruction by Apocalypse and Deathbird. Apocalypse granted him the ability of altering the mutations of other mutants. Cortez then appeared on the final season episode \\"The Fifth Horseman,\\" now turned into a servant and worshipper of his savior. Cortez assembled a cult worshipping Apocalypse as well as the Hounds, a foursome of altered mutants, in an attempt to find a new body for Apocalypse, who was defeated and left bodiless in \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\" Cortez captured Jubilee and turned Beast into a feral monster, but was stopped by Caliban, one of the Hounds. After being defeated, Cortez begged Apocalypse to be forgiven for his failure; though Apocalypse was not angry at Cortez, for he still had a host body to reincarnate into...Cortez's own. * Amelia Voght (voiced by Susan Roman) - Like her comics counterpart, Amelia was Charles Xavier's former lover and nurse. The two met and later fell in love after Xavier was crippled by Magneto, though they split because Amelia did not approve of the formation of the X-Men, preferring to live a quiet life with Charles and hide their mutant status. After meeting again in Asteroid M, she was initially hostile to Charles, though she forgave him after the X-Men helped defeat the fanatical Cortez. Amelia refused Charles' offer to join the X-Men, seeking now to find and follow her own dreams. She became a nurse once again and joined Moira MacTaggert at the facilities of Muir Island. She also helped Beast, Magneto, Forge, and Mister Sinister fight against the Phalanx. * Marco Delgado * Carmella Unuscione - Carmella appeared in episode \\"Sanctuary\\" as a prominent member of the Acolytes. As in the mainstream Marvel Universe, she was a devoted and passionate follower of Magneto and his beliefs. * Chrome (Allen Marc Yuric) * Joanna Cargill - Joanna appeared in episode \\"Sanctuary.\\" Though she did not have any speaking lines, she was a prominent member of the Acolytes. She also had a cameo in the first part of \\"One Man's Worth,\\" where she was a member of the Mutant Resistance, but retained her Acolyte outfit. * Burner (Byron Calley) - Burner appeared as a member of the Acolytes and, using his real name in the two-part episode \\"Sanctuary,\\" was one of the many mutants that took Magneto's offer to live in Asteroid M. Calley was in charge of overseeing the defensive missiles Magneto had gathered to prevent an attack on the asteroid. When Fabian Cortez attempted to fire the missiles to destroy Earth, Calley opposed him. It was also revealed that he was an old friend of Gambit. Morlocks When the Morlocks captured Cyclops and Jean Grey, Storm led the X-Men to rescue them. In the end, after a duel between Storm and Callisto, not only did the X-Men get Cyclops and Jean back, Storm also earned leadership of the Morlocks. They later appear in the episode \\"Out of the Past,\\" where the Morlocks are captured by Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers and she unleashes an alien. The X-Men saved the Morlocks and defeated the alien. * Callisto (voiced by Susan Roman) - The leader. * Annalee (voiced by Kay Tremblay) - She seemed to have a greater control over her powers, causing the X-Men, including Jean Grey, to experience any state of mind she chose to place them in, from Wolverine believing himself to be covered with scorpions, to Jean believing herself to be a young child and Annalee her mother. * Masque * Sunder (Mark Hallett) (voiced by Dan Hennessey) * Leech (voiced by John Stocker) * Tommy * Plague (voiced by Judy Marshak) * Erg * Tarbaby * Ape (voiced by Ross Petty) * Mole * Scaleface * Glowworm * Caliban * Marianne - A Morlock who is exclusive to the series. Shi'ar Imperial Guard The Shi'ar Imperial Guard appeared in the episodes \\"Phoenix Saga\\" and \\"Dark Phoenix Saga.\\" In the \\"Phoenix Saga,\\" the Imperial guards track down Lilandra and the M'Kraan crystal, following D'Ken's orders, but after D'Ken fuses with the M'Kraan crystal and Lilandra becomes empress, the Imperial guards help the X-Men and the Starjammers defeat D'Ken. Later, in \\"Dark Phoenix Saga,\\" the Imperial guards seek to destroy the Phoenix after she destroys a star system, but unlike the comics, the star system was deserted. So they go to Earth to stop Phoenix from destroying further systems. * Gladiator (Kallark) * Oracle (Sybil) * Starbolt * Smasher (Vril Rokk) * Manta * Tempest * Titan * Hussar * Quake * Hobgoblin/Shifter * Warstar (B'nee and C'cil) Assassins Guild * Bella Donna Boudreaux * Julian Boudreaux Villains * Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur) (voiced by John Colicos from 1992‚Äì1993, James Blendick from 1994‚Äì1996, then Lorne Kennedy in 1997) - Apocalypse wants to pit humans and mutants in a war and rule the stronger race. His first appearance is part of a plot line revolving around an offer to \\"cure\\" mutations. It is eventually revealed to be a trick to transform mutants into the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Apocalypse also appears in a storyline revolving around Cable. In this story, Apocalypse masquerades as a member of the Friends of Humanity, creating a techno-organic virus. In Cable's future (3999 A.D.), Apocalypse still wages his war against humanity and mutant-kind, opposed by Cable and his Clan Chosen. In the \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" storyline, Apocalypse attempted to attain godhood by kidnapping the most powerful psychic beings from across the universe. He planned to kill them simultaneously, in order to release a wave of psychic energy powerful enough to re-create the universe in his own image so he could rule unchallenged. However, Cable, Bishop, Magneto, Mystique, and the X-Men foil his plans. After the psychics are freed, they use their combined powers to trap Apocalypse in the Astral Plane for all eternity. In one of the final episodes of the series, Apocalypse is shown to be communicating from the Astral Plane with Fabian Cortez, whom Apocalypse had turned into his servant prior to the Axis of Time events. He tasked Cortez to find a powerful mutant to serve as his vessel, which would allow him to return to our world. However, Cortez failed due to the interruptions of Beast and Caliban. This resulted in Apocalypse claiming Cortez, himself, as the vessel and Apocalypse lived once more. In this animated version, Apocalypse was depicted many times as an invincible opponent. None of the X-Men's powers combined could do him much harm. Apocalypse's plans were occasionally hampered by the time-travelers Bishop and Cable. :Powers: Immortality, super strength, invulnerability to harm, shape-shifting, psionic powers, teleportation, force-field generation, and flight. * Mister Sinister (Nathaniel Essex) (voiced by Christopher Britton) - Interested in the creation of more powerful mutants, Sinister had an obsession with Cyclops and Jean Grey, as well as other powerful mutants such as Magneto. Like his comic counterpart, this Sinister was capable of emitting energy blasts from his hands and was vulnerable to Cyclops' optic beams. He was served both by the Nasty Boys and the Savage Land Mutates. Like in the comics, Sinister was originally a British scientist during the Victorian era, though he was not mutated by Apocalypse. This version of Sinister experimented on mutants and obtained organs from his minion, Jack the Ripper, and used the knowledge obtained through his activities to mutate himself. An ancestor of Professor X, Dr. Xavier, was one of Sinister's opponents and attempted to save his victims. Despite his origins having no link to Apocalypse, Sinister joined forces with him when Apocalypse plotted to rewrite reality by harnessing the power of the Axis of Time. * The Shadow King (Amahl Farouk) (voiced by Maurice Dean Wint) - Xavier defeated Shadow King and his psychic essence was trapped in the Astral Plane. He escaped briefly and possessed Storm's godson, Mjnari, in order to possess Storm. The Shadow King was defeated and trapped once again, only to be released after Professor X suffered an accident which left his mind vulnerable to the Shadow King's attempts to take possession of Xavier and leave his mind trapped in the Astral Plane. * Sabretooth (Victor Creed) (voiced by Don Francks) - Sabretooth was depicted as a henchman for Magneto. In the mainstream comics however, Sabretooth and Magneto have never come together in any real capacity. * Omega Red (Arkady Rossovich) (voiced by Len Doncheff) - Omega Red appeared in the episode \\"Red Dawn.\\" In this episode he is resuscitated by three corrupt generals who want to recreate the Soviet Union and rule it. Colossus, with the help of the X-Men, fights to save his country and its fragile freedom from these forces of tyranny. Omega Red later reappeared in \\"A Deal With the Devil.\\" In this episode he is thawed and sent two miles (3 km) beneath the ocean to salvage a disabled, toxic, nuclear submarine threatening to break up near Hawaii. He also appeared in Wolverine's flashbacks, in which Team X fights against Omega Red and manage to freeze him. The details of their confrontation are unclear, as Wolverine's memories were altered to make him believe Omega Red killed Maverick and Silver Fox. * Master Mold and the Sentinels (voiced by David Fox) - Master Mold and the Sentinels serve an important role during the first season. In one episode, the Sentinels, sent by Bolivar Trask and Henry Gyrich, kidnap the X-Men Gambit, Storm, and Jubilee while vacationing on the fictional island of Genosha. There, the three X-Men, along with several other mutants, are enslaved by Trask and Gyrich who are harnessing the mutants' powers to create a massive dam in Genosha whose water power will be used to run Trask's newly created Master Mold. The X-Men eventually escape Genosha and destroy most of the Sentinels when Storm floods the dam. Later on in the season, they learn that Trask has lost control of Master Mold, who is now stationed in Washington, D.C. Master Mold has Senator Kelly, and dozens of other important world leaders kidnapped, and demands that Trask replace their brains with computers that can be controlled by Master Mold. The X-Men help rescue Trask and Kelly from Master Mold, and at the end of the season's last episode, Professor X, with the help of Magneto, flies the X-Men's jet, full of explosives, into Master Mold's torso. Master Mold and all Sentinels are believed to be destroyed at this point, but they resurface in season four. This time Master Mold wanted to create a new body for himself, but the X-Men eventually destroyed Master Mold once and for all. Even though he was destroyed, Master Mold will be reconstructed at some point in history, becoming the ruler in Bishop's time-line. * Nimrod - In the animated continuity, Nimrod came from the \\"Days of Future Past\\" time-line, where Bishop is its contemporary. Nimrod follows Bishop into the past to stop him from preventing the assassination of Senator Kelly that causes the future time- line. With the help of Storm's powers, Bishop was able to defeat Nimrod on numerous occasions. * Bolivar Trask (voiced by Brett Halsey) - Trask is the creator of the Sentinels, and was much longer-lived than his comic counterpart, returning for several episodes (one of which ironically featured him on the run from his own creations, along with Gyrich). Trask was introduced here in the second episode of the series. * Henry Peter Gyrich (voiced by Barry Flatman) - Gyrich appeared in the episode \\"Night of the Sentinels.\\" He later appeared in the season one finale \\"The Final Decision,\\" the episode \\"Courage\\" (season 4), and the series finale \\"Graduation Day.\\" Gyrich's personality in the series was an extreme take on that of his appearances in the Avengers and X-Men comic books as he supported mutant oppression, and possibly even extinction, whereas in the comics he was merely distrustful of superhumans in general. In the series finale, he quickly revealed that Professor X was a mutant by calling on a force wave with a remote, which revealed his power of telepathy at a worldwide conference. This weakened Xavier and nearly killed him by the end of the episode, though in the end he was taken away by Lilandra to be cured. This attack also nearly wounded many other people at the conference. Gyrich was taken away in custody because of his insanity, but warned everyone not to trust anyone, because they might well be mutants. * Graydon Creed (voiced by John Stocker) - Like in the comics, Graydon Creed's deep resentment toward mutants comes from his parents, Sabretooth and Mystique. Graydon wound up in the care of his father, who bullied and beat him constantly. Many years later, Graydon founded the F.O.H. (Friends of Humanity), an anti-mutant hate group that did everything in its power to vilify mutants. After the Beast's pardon by the President, Graydon's resentment grew even more and the F.O.H. began targeting the X-Men. Graydon began looking for new ways to exterminate mutant-kind. He hired a brilliant scientist (who turned out to be Apocalypse) to create a virus that would wipe out every mutant on Earth, but would be relatively harmless to ordinary humans. His followers infect a number of mutants and spread rumors that mutants carry the disease. However Bishop and the X-Men destroy the virus. When Beast began dating his former patient Carly, a human, Graydon had her kidnapped, but the X-Men rescue her. Before they leave, the X-Men set up a holo-projector outside displaying Xavier's profile on the mutant Sabretooth, real name: Graydon Creed, Sr. Realizing that their leader was the son of a mutant, the F.O.H. leave him behind for the authorities. Later, Graydon returns to the F.O.H. to resume his old role as their leader. The council rules that first he has to prove himself. They tell Graydon to kill Sabretooth, Mystique, Rogue (his foster sister), and the demonic Nightcrawler, his own brother. Graydon kidnaps his mother Mystique and forces her to send a letter to Nightcrawler saying she was in danger. Fearing for his mother's life, Nightcrawler seeks the help of the X-Men Rogue and Wolverine. They locate the F.O.H.'s dam-base and walk straight into a trap. Graydon attempts to gas all of the mutants to death. They manage to break free and defeat him. Three of the council members inform him that he failed for the last time and as a result has been expelled from the order indefinitely. They parachute him to the house where Sabretooth was waiting. * Trevor Fitzroy - Fitzroy was a guest-star in the two-part episode \\"One Man's Worth.\\" Fitzroy, known as \\"the mutant traitor,\\" under the orders of Master Mold, travels back in time to 1959 to murder Charles Xavier. In the cartoon, he does not kill those whose energy he absorbs. * D'Ken - D'Ken was seen in the five-part \\"Phoenix Saga,\\" where his history was very much like it was in the comics. He was also responsible for the death of Cyclops' parents, and him becoming an orphan on Earth. D'Ken gained control over the M'Kraan crystal, which gave him powers. D'Ken had fused with the M'Kraan crystal, so after the Phoenix fixes the crack that D'ken made on the crystal to gain its power, D'Ken was trapped inside it. The Phoenix later hid the crystal in the heart of the Sun. * Erik the Red (Davan Shakari) (voiced by Lawrence Bayne) - Erik the Red was sent by D'ken to capture Lilandra and the M'Kraan crystal for him. * Zaladane - Zaladane was featured in the two-part episode \\"Savage Land, Strange Heart\\". High priestess of Garokk, Zaladane recruits Sauron into her scheme to awaken the god. * Garokk - Garokk was featured in the two-part episode \\"Savage Land, Strange Heart\\". * Deathbird (Cal'syee Neramani) - Deathbird made several appearances in the series. In flashbacks, she was seen at D'Ken's side when Christopher and Katherine Summers were abducted. Following Lilandra's ascension to the throne of the empire, Deathbird sought to overthrow her sister and install herself as Majestrix, for which she joined Apocalypse. However, Apocalypse was merely using Deathbird for his own plans. During the episode \\"Beyond Good and Evil,\\" she attacked Lilandra alongside Apocalypse. However, he abandoned her at the mercy of Lilandra and Imperial Guard Praetor Gladiator. Apocalypse simply wanted a distraction so he could kidnap Oracle, the psychic of the Imperial Guard. * Juggernaut (Cain Marko) (voiced by Rick Bennett) - Juggernaut fully appeared in three episodes: \\"The Unstoppable Juggernaut,\\" \\"Phoenix Saga\\" (part 3), and \\"Juggernaut Returns.\\" He attempted to get revenge on Xavier in all three episodes. * Mojo (voiced by Peter Wildman) - Mojo appeared in the episodes \\"Mojovision\\" and \\"Longshot.\\" * Spiral (Rita Wayword) (voiced by Cynthia Belliveau) - Spiral worked for Mojo and helped him torture the captured X-Men by making them perform in television shows against their wills, but eventually betrayed Mojo when she met and fell in love with Longshot. Their relationship, however, turned for the worse and Spiral once again turned to Mojo's side in the end. * Black Tom Cassidy - Cassidy teamed up with Juggernaut to kidnap Lilandra in the \\"Phoenix Saga.\\" He and Banshee are referred to as brothers in the series continuity with Banshee being the elder. * Cameron Hodge (voiced by Stephen Ouimette) - Cameron Hodge first appeared as a lawyer for Hank McCoy. Later, Hodge was an ambassador working for the mutant-oppressing Genoshan government. After the corrupt government was overthrown by the combined efforts of Cable and the X-Men, Hodge, who was now missing an arm and a leg courtesy of Cable, vowed to get his revenge on the mutants. He was fortunate enough to have met up with the techno-organic alien race known as the Phalanx. Restoring his missing limbs and granting him a fraction of their power, the Phalanx promised to help him get his revenge and, in exchange, he would help them assimilate planet Earth and its inhabitants. Hodge was defeated when the X-Men, with the help of Amelia Voght, Magneto, Mr. Sinister, and Warlock, drove the Phalanx from Earth. * Purple Man (Zebediah Killgrave) - The Purple Man appeared in the fourth episode of season five, \\"No Mutant Is an Island,\\" as a telepathic mutant terrorist who plans on taking over the government using a group of young mutants under his mental control. In the end, the X-Man Cyclops gets in his way and eventually defeats him. * The High Evolutionary (Herbert Wyndham) (voiced by James Blendick) and the New Men - The High Evolutionary is the Master of Wundagore. He seeks to create a superior generation of his New Men by using mutant DNA, mutating humans into beast-like beings, instead of experimenting on animals. He sets up a trap to capture Magneto, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch, revealing to the twins that they are Magneto's children. He also appeared in a flashback, in which he fights Garokk and traps his essence in the ground of the Savage Land. * Arkon (voiced by Paul Haddad) - Arkon appeared in the episode \\"Storm Front\\" (parts 1 and 2). In the series, Arkon unleashes terrible weather conditions over Washington, D.C., to get Storm's attention. It works and he begs her to return with him to his planet, Corsus, to save it from meteorological chaos, which threatens his people. After much pleading, Arkon convinces Storm. Intrigued by this dynamic leader but slightly suspicious, Storm departs, but leaves a clue for the other X-Men to follow. Once Storm saves the planet, she is proclaimed savior throughout this universe, and Arkon asks her to marry him. Later she finds out that his ships are bringing thousands of slaves from nearby planets, and knows that Arkon is a tyrant. * Proteus (Kevin McTaggart) (voiced by Stuart Stone) - Proteus appeared in the two-part episode \\"Proteus\\" (season 4), which was based on 1979‚Äì1980 Uncanny X-Men storyline. In the episode, he escapes from Muir Island to find out who his father is and creates havoc around the city, and the X-Men have to stop him. * The Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) (voiced by Cedric Smith) - The Red Skull appears in the episode \\"Old Soldiers.\\" He appears in Wolverine's flashbacks when Wolverine remembers his past. Red Skull had kidnapped a scientist and was working for the Nazis. * Silver Samurai (Kenuicho Harada) (voiced by Denis Akiyama) - Silver Samurai appeared in the episode \\"The Lotus and the Steel.\\" He is given little characterization in the episode, reduced to a mere gang leader whose thugs terrorize a village where Wolverine has been living. The villagers stand their ground and Wolverine bests the samurai in single combat by taking advantage of Samurai's habit of teleporting behind him. Wolverine anticipates the move and disables the teleportation device, humiliating Samurai. * The Phalanx - The Phalanx appear in the episode \\"The Phalanx Covenant.\\" They are a techno-organic, extraterrestrial race bent on assimilating every other lifeform. They invade the Earth, though they are initially unable to assimilate mutants. This version of the Phalanx is an amalgamation of the comics' Technarchy and Phalanx. Villain teams Brotherhood of Mutants The Brotherhood of Mutants in this series is based on the third incarnation of the team from the comic books. The group is led by Mystique, with the Blob, Avalanche, and Pyro as members of the group, and Rogue being shown as a former member. The group is revealed to have been initially financed by the mutant Apocalypse, though only Mystique knew this. Notably absent from the series was the Brotherhood member and Mystique's longtime lesbian lover, Destiny, who was a major member of the team in the comics. As such, major changes were made towards the series' adaptation of \\"Days of Future Past\\" storyline, in which Destiny played a major role during the climax of the story. * Mystique (Raven Darkholme) (voiced by Rachel Carpenter, later by Jennifer Dale) - Mystique was shown as the leader of the Brotherhood, a close ally of Apocalypse, Rogue's foster mother, and Nightcrawler's birth mother. In the first season, Mystique aids Apocalypse in transforming several mutants into his Horsemen. Later he orders her to assassinate Senator Kelly, a task for which she impersonates the X-Man Gambit. She fails due to the interference of the real Gambit. In the second season, Mystique attempts to convince Rogue to return to the Brotherhood, though she fails in the end. Mystique once again appears as an ally of Apocalypse in the \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" storyline; however, when Magneto realizes how mad Apocalypse's intentions are, Mystique joins him in trying to stop Apocalypse. In her final appearance of the series, Mystique is kidnapped by Graydon Creed, her child by Sabretooth. She is forced to send a letter to her other son, Nightcrawler, to lure him to a trap in exchange for her life. Creed attempts to kill all the mutants, but they escape. As Mystique flees, Nightcrawler gives chase because he wants to know why she abandoned him. Even though Mystique coldly tells him that she did not want him, Nightcrawler cannot bring himself to hate her and tells her that he will pray to God to allow him to forgive her. Touched that in spite of her cold treatment her son still cares for her, Mystique apparently sacrifices herself to save Nightcrawler when Creed attempts to shoot him. Though assumed dead by the X-Men, Mystique is shown to have survived and is last seen looking back at her two children with tears in her eyes. * Avalanche (Dominic Szilard Petros) (voiced by Rod Coneybeare) - Avalanche was always accompanied by Pyro and Blob. He usually acts as a hired henchman of Mystique. * Pyro (St. John Allerdyce) (voiced by Graham Halley) - He appeared in four episodes (although he only had lines in three). He was characterized as British (instead of Australian like the comics), using slang terms such as \\"old bean\\" and \\"old girl\\" in conversation. * Blob (Frederick J. Dukes) (voiced by Robert Calt) - He appeared in several episodes. Nasty Boys While the Nasty Boys are barely a passing blip in the extensive history of the X-Men comics, the villainous team was featured several times in the series. Appearing first in the episode \\"Til Death Do Us Part (part 2),\\" the series featured four of the Boys: Ruckus, Gorgeous George, Hairbag, and Slab. The X-Man Morph, who had been resurrected by Mr. Sinister, had an \\"evil\\" side to his personality. \\"Evil\\" Morph was often a part-time member of the Nasty Boys, but Sinister increasingly lost control of him. The Nasty Boys reappeared in both parts of \\"Reunion,\\" where, teamed with the Savage Land Mutates, they proved to be quite imposing to the X-Men, whom Sinister had rendered powerless. The X-Men eventually regained their powers, freed Morph from Sinister completely, and defeated Sinister and the Boys. After leaving the Savage Land, the Boys reappeared with Sinister in all four parts of \\"Beyond Good and Evil.\\" Vertigo apparently accompanied them (Sinister had given her a Magneto-inspired energy boost in \\"Reunion\\") and was made into a member, despite her female status. * Gorgeous George (George Blair) (voiced by Rod Wilson) - George played a prominent role. He appeared in X-Men Adventures, a comic book based on the animated series. * Ruckus (Clement Wilson) (voiced by Dan Hennessey) - Ruckus played a prominent role as leader of the Nasty Boys. He seemed to be older, but the others often cracked jokes at him being Sinister's \\"lapdog.\\" He also appeared in several issues of X-Men Adventures. * Slab (Christopher Anderson) - Slab also appeared with the Nasty Boys. * Hairbag - In the show, Hairbag's powers were altered somewhat, giving him poisonous breath and the ability to fire drugged, quill-like hairs from his body. Savage Land Mutates Savage Land Mutates were the creations of Magneto, though they were later recruited by Mr. Sinister. * Sauron (Karl Lykos) (voiced by Robert Bockstael) - Sauron became a major villain after the X-Men first visited the Savage Land. Unlike his psychiatrist persona, in this version Lykos was apparently an inhabitant of the Savage Land and was mutated by Magneto, though he later became a follower of Mr. Sinister. This version of Sauron did not appear to possess the psychic scream and fire breath of his comic counterpart. Despite this, he was a formidable foe in many episodes. * Brainchild * Amphibius (voiced by Peter McCowatt) * Lupo * Barbarus * Vertigo (voiced by Megan Smith) - Veritigo was one of the followers of Mr. Sinister in the Savage Land. In the series, her powers were amplified after Mr. Sinister genetically modified her with Magneto's DNA. Later on, she joins the Nasty Boys who were also working for Mr. Sinister. Inner Circle Club The Hellfire Club appeared in the \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" storyline, though it was renamed Inner Circle Club to prevent controversy regarding the use of the word hellfire, which could have prompted accusations of satanism. The Inner Circle's leaders aim to control Jean Grey and brainwash her into believing herself to be the Queen of the Inner Circle, though they only manage to unleash the Dark Phoenix. * Sebastian Shaw * Emma Frost - Emma made appearances as the White Queen of the Inner Circle Club. She appears in the first three parts of the \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" and is shown briefly among a group of telepaths in the episode \\"Beyond Good and Evil (part 4): End and Beginning.\\" * Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind) (voiced by Nigel Bennett) - Wyngarde appears in the first three parts of the \\"Dark Phoenix Saga.\\" He uses his powers to control the Phoenix, but ends up unleashing the Dark Phoenix. Wyngarde is also a member of the Mutant Resistance in the alternate reality shown in the first part of the episode \\"One Man's Worth.\\" * Harry Leland (Black Bishop) * Donald Pierce Horsemen of Apocalypse The Four Horsemen of Apocalypse were the same ones as in the X-Factor comics. The lineup was composed by mutants that submitted themselves to the so-called mutant \\"cure,\\" developed by Dr. Adler (Mystique in disguise). The cure process transformed the four mutants: Autumn Rolfson (Famine) (voiced by Catherine Gallant), Plague (Pestilence), Abraham Kieros (War) (voiced by James Millington), and Angel (Death) into altered mutants under the control of Apocalypse. The four-part episode \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" featured another team of Horsemen, created by Apocalypse during his time in Ancient Egypt. The style of these Horsemen reflected their Egyptian origins. Reavers The Reavers appear alongside Lady Deathstrike when she goes down to the Morlock's tunnel and tricks Wolverine into coming down there, hoping to get him to open an alien ship that she found in the tunnel. When the ship is opened, an alien comes out of the ship and sucks the life out of the Reavers. So Lady Deathstrike has to work together with Wolverine to defeat the alien. In the end, the X-Men defeat the alien and all the Reavers' life energy is sent back to their bodies. * Bonebreaker * Pretty Boy * Murray Reese * Wade Cole * Lady Deathstrike (Yuriko Oyama) (voiced by Tasha Simms) - Lady Deathstrike was also a Reavers member. She had a romantic past with Wolverine, likely merging her character with Wolverine's former fianc√©e, Mariko Yashida. She first appeared in the episode \\"Out of the Past\\" (season 3). Deathstrike joined the Reavers and became a cyborg in order to avenge the death of her father, Professor Oyama, during Logan's rampage at the Weapon X headquarters. In this continuity, the Professor (of Weapon X) and Yuriko's father are the same man. In the comic's continuity, the Professor is a man named Thorton and has no blood relation to the Oyamas. Weapon X The Weapon X program was responsible for Wolverine's adamantium endoskeleton and fabricated memories. The program was directed by the Professor and Dr. Cornelius. Weapon X captured the four members of Team X (Logan, Victor Creed, Maverick, and Silver Fox) in order to brainwash them to become an elite team of mind-controlled assassins. However, Wolverine escaped and his rampage through the Weapon X headquarters allowed Creed, Maverick, and Silver Fox to escape. * Professor (in video and flashbacks) * Dr. Cornelius (in shadows within video and flashbacks) * Professor Oyama Never actually appears in the series. Mentioned by Professor Thorton in \\"Weapon X, Lies, and Videotape\\" and by Lady Deathstrike in \\"Out of the Past.\\" * Talos - Shiva/Talos appeared in the episode \\"Weapon X, Lies & Videotape.\\" Due to network censorship, the robot's name was changed to Talos. Mojo's Trackers/Wildways Besides Spiral, Mojo employed a number of agents and servants. * Major Domo * Arize * Gog * Quark * The Warwolves The Colony/Brood The Colony appear in the episode \\"Love in Vain\\" in a New Mexico desert. Wolverine witnesses the crash of a spaceship carrying horrific, alien bug-like creatures, the Colony, which overwhelm him. They differ from their appearance in the comics as these Brood are human sized with greenish skin and could fire electrical energy blasts from their tails. They also had four mechanical tentacles similar to Doctor Octopus and had an anti- gravity generator that allowed them to fly. People would be infected by spores and would turn into drones for the Colony. They also had red eyes and appeared similar to the Xenomorphs from the Alien movies. Children of the Shadow The Children of the Shadow The Children of the Shadow appeared in the episode \\"Secrets, Not Long Buried\\" when Cyclops flies solo to Skull Mesa, a tiny western desert community of mutants and humans to see an old friend Dr. Prescott and his plane is blasted out of the sky. Injured and rendered powerless, he struggles into town only to discover his friend is missing and the town is caught in the grips of a criminal mutant group called the Children of the Shadow. The group hunts him down, seeing he is vulnerable because they have temporarily removed his powers and he is opposing them. As they try to make an example out of Cyclops his words get others to help and he recovers his powers from the healing aid of one of them, along with some other mutants Cyclops defeats them. * Solarr (Bill Braddock) - The leader of the Children of the Shadow. * Chet Lambert - Exclusive to the TV series, Chet Lambert is a mutant who possesses intangibility. * Toad (Mortimer Toynbee) - Member of the Children of the Shadow. He possesses toad-like abilities. The Avengers (in the Xavier-less time-line) * Captain America * Iron Man (Tony Stark) * Giant Man (Henry Pym) * Wasp (Janet van Dyne) * Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) * Doctor Strange * Hercules * Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly) * Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom) * Daredevil (Matt Murdock) Cameo appearances (heroes and villains) * War Machine (James Rhodes), Sunfire, and Spider-Man were shown saving people from falling rubble in the \\"Phoenix Saga.\\" * Domino (Neena Thurman) (voiced by Jennifer Dale), Feral (Maria Callasantos), Rictor (Julio \\"Ric\\" Richter), and Warpath (James Proudstar) were seen as slaves on Slave Island. Domino also had a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Repo Man.\\" * Kangaroo (Frank Oliver), Random (Marshall Stone III), Arclight (Philippa Sontag), Blockbuster (Michael Baer), Tarbaby, and Black Panther (T'Challa) had a cameo appearance in the two-part episode \\"Sanctuary.\\" * Ghost Rider appeared briefly as a memory in one of Gambit's flashbacks in the episode \\"Final Decision.\\" * Deadpool (Wade Wilson) - Morph briefly transforms into Deadpool. Deadpool's face is also seen in a flashback while Professor X is probing the mind of Sabretooth. In the \\"Phoenix Saga,\\" an evil psychic projection of Xavier also created an illusion of Deadpool while tormenting Wolverine. * Moondragon (Heather Douglas), Stryfe, and Typhoid Mary (Mary Walker) had a cameo in the episode \\"Beyond Good and Evil (part 4).\\" * Immortus (Kang the Conqueror/Nathaniel Richards) had a cameo after he was revealed as the true identity of Bender, the Axis of Time custodian. * Gatecrasher had a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Proteus (part 1).\\" * Eternity, Doctor Strange, Captain Britain (Brian Braddock), Spider-Man Uatu, and Thor had a cameo appearance in the \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" (part 3). * Nick Fury, G.

The flight was operated by Thai Airways International, the flag carrier of Thailand. On 11 December 1998, the aircraft, an Airbus A310-204 registered in Thailand as HS- TIA, stalled and crashed onto a swamp during its landing attempt at Surat Thani Airport. A total of 101 people were killed in the crash. Thailand's Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee (AAIC) opened an investigation into the accident. The investigation revealed that the crew had become disoriented. Visibility was limited. Stress caused the crew to lose control of the aircraft. The AAIC noted also Surat Thani's minimal lighting and faulty warnings to the aircraft. The accident was the second deadliest plane crash in Thailand, behind Lauda Air Flight 004. It was the fifth worst accident involving the Airbus A310 and the fourth hull loss of an Airbus A310.  Aircraft  The aircraft with registration HS-TIA was an Airbus A310-204, c/n 415, previously registered as F-WWBI for flight testing with Airbus. Given the name Phitsanulok, HS-TIA was first flown on 3 March 1986 and delivered to Thai Airways on 29 April 1986.  Passengers and crews  Flight 261 was carrying 132 passengers and 14 crew members. There were 25 foreigners on board the flight including nationalities from Austria, Australia, Britain, Finland, Germany, Israel, Japan, Norway, and the United States. The rest of the passengers were Thais. Among the passengers were Siriwan, the sister of Thai Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, Thai actor and singer Ruangsak Loychusak and , a Member of Parliament from Surat Thani. The captain, identified as Captain Pinit Vechasilp, had 10,167 flight hours, including 3,000 hours on the Airbus A300-600/A310. Although the A300 and A310 are separate aircraft, the -600 variant of the A300 has a nearly identical cockpit design as the A310. The unnamed first officer has been reported to have 2,839 flight hours, with 983 of them on the Airbus A300-600/A310.  Accident  Flight TG261 departed from Bangkok's Don Mueang International Airport with 132 passengers and 14 crew members at 17:40 local time to Surat Thani, a gateway city for popular resort island of Koh Samui in Thailand. It was cleared to fly at flight level 310. The estimated flight time was one hour and 55 minutes. At the time, Thailand was hosting the 1998 Asian Games and many schools had been closed due to the event. Many Thais had headed to holiday resorts. At 18:26 local time, the co-pilot contacted Surat Thani controller for approach. The aircraft, at the time, was located at 70 nautical miles from the airport. Surat Thani Airport cleared the flight for an approach under the Instrument Flight Rules. The weather at Surat Thani Airport was in good condition with good visibility and calm wind. At 18:39 local time, the co-pilot contacted Surat Thani to report Fligh 261's position. Surat Thani controller then stated that the Precision Approach Path Indicator on the right side of the runway 22 was not functional and the indicator on the left side was in use. Two minutes later, Flight 261 was cleared to land. The flight crews were cautioned of slippery runway due to deteriorating weather condition. At 18:42 local time, the runway was sighted and the pilots attempted to land the aircraft. They then decided to go-around for a second approach. The flight was cleared for its second landing attempt. This time, however, the pilots could not see the runway and opted for another go-around. At 19:05 local time, the flight crews were informed on the weather in the area, which was acknowledged by the crew members. The weather in the area deteriorated and the visibility was reduced from 1,500 meters to 1,000 meters. The pilots informed the passengers on the deteriorating weather condition and announced that they would attempt another landing for the third time and stated that if they failed again they would divert the flight back to Bangkok. During its go-around, the nose of the aircraft gradually increased from 18 degrees to 48 degrees. The speed of the aircraft began to decay and the aircraft began to shake. It entered an aerodynamic stall. As it began to shake, surviving flight attendants recounted that passengers began to scream and stay out of their seats, with luggage reportedly \\"flying around everywhere\\". The Airbus A310 crashed onto a swampy ground near a flooded rubber plantation and exploded, bursting into flames. The crash site was located 760 yards from the runway. Many of the occupants were drowned by the waist-deep water, while the remaining survivors had to crawl to escape from the wreckage. Local residents immediately rushed to the crash site to rescue the survivors. Search and rescue operation was hampered by the location of the crash, which was on a swamp. Rescuers reported that most of the survivors were seated at the front portion of the aircraft. More than 400 soldiers and police were deployed to assist in the rescue operation. By 12 December, rescuers managed to retrieve 100 bodies from the crash site. Overstretch on the resources caused the set up of makeshift morgue in Surat Thani International Airport. The bodies were laid on the main lobby and the body bags were opened in view of queuing passengers. Many of the bodies were burnt beyond recognition, causing difficulties on the identification process. Identification of the victims was also hampered by the fact that passengers were not required to fill a form for a domestic flight. Search operation was suspended on 13 December after the last victim was recovered. In total, 101 passengers and crews, including both the pilot and the co-pilot, were killed in the crash. Forty-five people survived, with 30 people suffered serious injuries. Among the survivors were 12 foreigners (three Australians, three Japanese, three Germans, two Israelis and one Briton) and Thai actor and singer Ruangsak Loychusak. Siriwan, the sister of Thai Minister of Transport and Communications of Thailand Suthep Thaugsuban, and , Member of Parliament from Surat Thani, were among those killed.  Investigation  Search on the flight's black boxes was immediately conducted. The search was initially hampered due to the watery environment of the crash site, added with muddy and murky water condition. Both the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were eventually found by the search and rescue team and were taken from the crash site for further investigation. Both recorders were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the United States for readout analysis. Pieces of the wreckage were recovered and were taken to a site for further inspection by Thai investigators. Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, announced that they would send a team of specialists to assist Thai authorities in the crash investigation.  Inclement weather  In the initial aftermath of the accident, many believed that the weather played a major factor in the disaster. Heavy rainstorm was reportedly present prior to Flight 261's landing. Several survivors and victims' relatives questioned the pilots' decision to land at the airport even though the weather was not in acceptable condition for landing. Airline officials had told crew members to fly according to the company's procedures, in which pilots should not land if the meteorological condition in the area was inclement. Investigators stated that bad weather was the probable cause of the accident, without ruling out pilot error. Other possible causes were also being investigated.  Lack of navigation instrument  Reports emerged that the runway in Surat Thani Airport was lacking an essential navigation system. While airport officials only commented that the radio navigation system was working normally and declined to comment further on the issue, Thai officials confirmed that a part of the navigation system, called as the Instrument landing system (ILS), had to be taken off due to an expansion program at the airport. The system was planned to be put back on to the runway, however the subsequent 1997 Asian financial crisis caused it to be postponed. A Thai air force pilot stated that due to the removal of the Instrument landing system (ILS), pilots had to use a radio navigation system which was less accurate.  Management oversight  In the same year, Thai Airways International began reducing the number of its foreign pilots. Vice-president of the company Chamlong Poompuang stated that pilots were trained to exercise high caution. At the same time, he recognized that the airline had taken fuel-saving measures due to the economic downturn, but it should not be considered contrary to safety. Thai Airways International chairman, Thamnoon Wanglee emphasized, \\"Safety is our highest priority. What our policy is and what happened are two different things.\\"  Conclusion  Thailand's Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee concluded the cause of the crash as follows: Aftermath Thai Airways International offered compensation payment to the families affected by the crash. Chairman Wanglee stated in a news conference that each relative of the 101 victims of the crash would receive a compensation payment of US$100,000, while the 45 injured survivors would receive a compensation of 200,000 baht (US$5,600) each. The airline would pay their medical expenses. Television episodes * Modernine TV discussed Thai Airways International Flight 261 on TimeLine, 30 May 2016, in \\"Flight 261 Disaster\\".

The library system owns over 880,000 items, which together allow yearly circulation totals to exceed three million checkouts. In addition to circulation, LCL provides youth, teen, and adult programming to its customers throughout the year. Lincoln City Libraries was evaluated in 2003 by Dubberly Garcia Associates, who performed a customer and non-user survey. The survey concluded that nearly 86% of customers were either 'satisfied\\" or 'very satisfied' with the library. Dubberly Garcia Associates indicated this was the second highest score among twenty-one similarly sized library systems throughout the country. Additionally, Hennen's American Public Library Ratings has often ranked Lincoln City Libraries as one of the top ten in the nation in its population category based on circulation, staff, materials and reference service. Lincoln City Libraries does not charge overdue fees for materials designated for youth or children, effective January 2019.  History  In 1875 the Lincoln City Library and Reading Room Association was formed as a private organization. In 1877, the Nebraska State Legislature passed a bill allowing the municipal governments of any community in the state of Nebraska to form a public library system and the Lincoln City Library and Reading Room Association was subsequently incorporated as a city- owned and tax-funded organization the same year. In 1899, all but the 800 books on loan to patrons were lost to a fire which destroyed the Masonic Temple in which the library was housed. In response, prominent Lincolnites such as Mary Baird Bryan, wife of William Jennings Bryan, petitioned Andrew Carnegie to help provide a library building for the city. Carnegie was a library patron, establishing over 2,000 libraries worldwide, and agreed to fund the construction of a library building for the city if the public would raise funds to purchase the site. The people of Lincoln, from schoolchildren to socialites, raised $10,000 to purchase property at 14th and N streets. The library was opened in 1902 and became nicknamed Old Main. In total, Andrew Carnegie funded the construction of five Lincoln City Libraries, though at the time of their construction three were located in suburbs of Lincoln which were later annexed. Carnegie financed the construction of public libraries in the towns of Havelock, University Place, and College View as well as a branch library in Northeast Lincoln. In 1937, the Bethany Library was opened in a former bank building and was stocked by the donated collections of the Bethany Women's Club and the Bethany Women's Missionary Society. In 1958, the current Bethany Branch Library was built to replace it. In 1955, the South Branch Library was opened at 27th and South streets. Old Main served the city until 1960 when it was replaced by a new building on the same site financed by a $300,000 donation by Bennett and Dorothy Martin. Bennett Martin served a term on the Lincoln City Council in the early 1950s and was mayor of Lincoln from 1956 to 1959, the Bennett Martin Public Library honors his public service and donation. In 1967, Lilian Helms Polley financed the addition of the North and East wings of Bennett Martin Library. In 1977, a subsequent addition created two more floors on the library which house the administrative offices and the Jane Pope Geske Heritage Room of Nebraska Authors. By 1971, the Carnegie libraries in the neighborhoods of Havelock and University Place were replaced by the Victor E. Anderson Branch Library and the College View Library was replaced by the Charles H. Gere Branch Library. The Carnegie-funded Northeast Branch Library, built in 1909, continued to function as a branch library until 1982. The building was preserved and relocated to become part of the Matt Talbot Community Kitchen and Outreach Center. In 2002, the Bess Dodson Walt Branch Library and Loren Corey Eiseley Branch Library were opened in southwest and north Lincoln respectively. The Eiseley Branch Library replaced the smaller Belmont and Arnold Heights libraries.

He was one of the top Soviet snipers in the war, with five hundred confirmed kills. Early years Born to a peasant family in Glinkovsky District, Smolensk Oblast, Russia, Sidorenko attended ten grades of school, and later studied at the Penza Art College at Penza, south-east of Moscow. In 1939, he dropped out of college, and was conscripted into the Red Army for training at the Simferopol Military Infantry School, in the Crimean Peninsula. World War II service In 1941, he fought in the Battle of Moscow, as a Junior Lieutenant of a mortar company. During the battle, he spent a lot of time teaching himself to snipe. His hunts for enemy soldiers were successful, prompting Sidorenko's commanders to order him to train others, who were chosen for their eyesight, weapons knowledge, and endurance. He first taught them theory, and then slowly started taking them out on combat missions with him. The Germans soon began fielding snipers of their own in Sidorenko's area of operation, to counter the new threat posed by him and his men. Sidorenko became assistant commander of the Headquarters of the 1122nd Rifle Regiment, fighting as part of the 1st Baltic Front. Though he mainly instructed, he occasionally fought in battles, taking one of his trainees with him. On one of these excursions, he destroyed a tank and three tractors using incendiary bullets. However, he was wounded several times, most seriously in Estonia in 1944; as a result of which he remained hospitalized until the end of the war. While recuperating from this wound, Sidorenko was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union on 4 June 1944; afterwards he was prohibited from seeing combat again by his superiors, as he was a valuable sniper trainer. By the end of the war, he was credited with five hundred confirmed kills, and had trained over two hundred and fifty snipers. Ranked a Major, he was the most successful Soviet sniper of the Second World War, and used the Russian Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle, equipped with a telescopic sight. Post-war life After the war ended, he retired from the Red Army, and settled down in Chelyabinsk Oblast, in the Ural Mountains, where he worked as the foreman of a coal mine. In 1974, he moved to the Republic of Dagestan, in the Caucasus. He died on 19 February 1994 in Kizlyar, Dagestan.

For 2005‚Äì06 he returned to Spain, being loaned to RC Celta de Vigo; as the Galicians finished in sixth position and reached the UEFA Cup straight from Segunda Divisi√≥n, he was heavily featured, scoring against Real Madrid (2‚Äì1 home defeat) and former team Atl√©tico (opening a 3‚Äì0 away win). After extensive negotiations, the deal with Celta was made permanent in late May 2006, for four years. Lequi suffered relegation in the first season after his purchase and, with the club already in the second level, was sent off a total of four times in the league as they languished in 16th position; he was released in August 2008. Lequi spent the following months training on his own. In the 2009 summer transfer window, he moved to Greek side Iraklis Thessaloniki FC. On 19 January 2011, the free agent returned to Spain and signed a five-month with UD Las Palmas of the second tier.

To distinguish the two, the histamenon was changed in form from the original solidus, becoming wider and thinner, as well as concave (scyphate) in form. Later usually shortened to stamenon (Greek: œÉœÑŒ¨ŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ), it was discontinued after 1092. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the name stamenon came to be applied to the concave billon and copper trachea coins. Establishment Ever since Emperor Constantine I () introduced it in 309, the Byzantine Empire's main coinage had been the high-quality solidus or nomisma, which had remained standard in weight (4.55 grams) and gold content (24 carats) through the centuries. Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (), however, introduced a new coin, the [nomisma] tetarteron (\\"quarter [coin]\\") which was 2 carats (i.e. about 1‚ÅÑ12, despite its name) lighter than the original nomisma. The latter now became known as the histamenon, from the Greek verb , \\"to stand up\\", implying that these followed the traditional standard. The reasons for this change are not clear; Byzantine chroniclers, however, suggest fiscal motives, reporting that Nikephoros collected the taxes as before in the histamenon while paying back with the tetarteron, which was officially rated as equal in value to the full-weight coin. Histamenon of Emperor Isaac I Komnenos (r. 1057‚Äì1059), with its by then characteristic concave form Initially, the two coins were virtually indistinguishable except in weight. During the later reign of Basil II (), the tetarteron began to be minted in a thicker and smaller form, while the histamenon became correspondingly thinner and wider. Only during the sole rule of Constantine VIII () did the two coins become iconographically distinct as well. By the mid-11th century, the tetarteron measured 18 mm wide and its weight apparently standardized at 3.98 grams, i.e. three carats less than the histamenon or stamenon (a name first attested in 1030), which now measured 25 mm in diameter (as opposed to 20 mm for the original solidus). In addition, under Michael IV the Paphlagonian (), it began to be minted in a slightly concave (scyphate) form, possibly to increase the thin coin's strength and to make it less easily bent. Flat coins were still struck at times, but scyphate ones came to predominate from Constantine IX () on and became standard under Isaac I Komnenos (). These concave coins were known as histamena trachea or simply trachea (œÑœÅŒ±œáŒ≠Œ±, \\"rough, uneven\\") from their shape. Debasement and abolition An example of the greatly debased later histamena: an electrum coin of the first years of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (). Starting with Michael IV, who was a former money lender, the gold content began to be increasingly lowered and the coins debased. After a period of relative stability in circa 1055‚Äì1070, the gold content declined dramatically in the disastrous 1070s and 1080s. The michaelata of Michael VII Doukas () still contained some 16 carats of gold, but by the time of Alexios I Komnenos (), the nomismata struck contained almost no gold at all. Thus, in 1092, Alexios I carried out a comprehensive monetary reform, replacing among others the debased gold coins, both the histamenon and the tetarteron, with a new high- quality gold issue, the hyperpyron. Henceforth, and for the duration of the Komnenian monetary system (12th‚Äì13th centuries), the term stamenon, due to its association with scyphate coins, came to be applied as a blanket term to the similarly concave billon and copper coins (trachea) issued by the Byzantine Empire.

He is most famous for his humorous, colorful, surreal and wordless depictions of love, sports (in particular soccer and golf), and long-necked animals. From 1976 to 1981, Mordillo's cartoons were used by Slovenian artist Miki Muster to create Mordillo, a series of 400 short animations (300 min) that were later presented at Cannes and bought by television studios from 30 countries. Biography The son of Spanish parents, Mordillo spent his childhood in Villa Pueyrred√≥n in Buenos Aires, where he had an early interest in drawing. In 1948 he obtained the certificate of Illustrator from the School of Journalism. Two years later, while continuing to study, as part of the animation team Burone Bruch he illustrated children's stories (Tales of Perrault Tales of Schmid, The Musicians of Bremen and The Three Little Pigs) edited by Codex. In 1952 he co-founded Galas Studios, dedicated to the production of animations. Meanwhile, he continued to develop his career as an illustrator and published some strips in local magazines. On 7 November 1955, he moved to Lima, Peru, where he worked as a freelance designer for the advertising company McCann Erickson. In 1958 Aesop's Fables illustrated and Samaniego for Editorial Iberia Lima. After having done greeting-card illustrations for the Kansas City-based Hallmark Cards, he left for the United States in 1960. When there he was employed by Paramount Pictures Studios in New York. Part of the performance of the film in two globally significant characters: Popeye and Little Lulu and creates two characters for the short film Trick for tree. Three years later, on 20 August his life changed direction again. This time he travelled to Europe, arriving in Paris on 19 September. There, he worked at first humorous letters to Mic-Max Edition. In July 1966 he began to collaborate with the magazine Le Pelerin and shortly after doing the same in Paris Match. Two years later, his work started being printed in publications from other parts of the world, most notably Germany's Stern. In Paris he met his wife Amparo Camarasa, marrying in 1969. They have two children: Sebastian Jerome (1970) and Cecile Isabelle (1972). In 1980 he moved to Mallorca, Spain, and was named President of the International Association of Authors of Comics and Cartoons (CFIA) based in Geneva, Switzerland. After 18 years in Spain, he returned to France in 1998. The following year he participated in the Creative Workshop Zermatt, Switzerland. In 2007 he experimented with new materials: acrylics, pastels and crayons. The following year he performed with Art Petrus a series of reproductions of pictures in high definition. Also that year he sold a numbered and autographed internet publication, Mordillo Collection. He resided in Monaco.

He later went into business on his own, involved in the fur trade and the importing of goods. In 1796, with Tod and others, he was purchased the fiefs of Grosse-√éle and Granville. He married his cousin, Margaret Porteous, in 1798; she died the following year and their child died while still very young. Mure was involved in a conglomerate of companies that took part in the fur trade, supplied traders and merchants and trans-Atlantic shipping. He later became a partner in the XY Company and then in the North West Company. Mure also took part in the timber trade. In 1799, he was named justice of the peace. In 1804, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for York in the Ottawa valley; he was reelected there in 1808 and 1809. In 1810, he was elected to the legislative assembly for the Lower Town of Quebec. He was named to the Executive Council in 1812. Mure served as an officer in the local militia during the War of 1812.

The ship is primarily assigned to the Yorkshire Universities Royal Naval Unit (URNU), serving the universities of Hull, Sheffield and Leeds. The ship is based in Kingston-Upon-Hull and mainly operates on the East coast of the UK, particularly in and around the river Humber. HMS Explorer is the second ship to bear the name; her predecessor was an unarmed experimental Walter-turbine submarine based on the captured high test peroxide (HTP) powered German Type XVIIB submarine launched in 1956 and scrapped in 1965.  Construction  HMS Example and HMS Explorer seen either side of HMS Archer, demonstrating the distinctive black hull of the RNXS Example Class. Explorer was built in 1986 by the now-defunct Watercraft Marine for the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service (RNXS) as an Example class tender, to the same design as the Royal Navy Archer class, as XSV Explorer. The Example class were distinguishable from their Royal Navy counterparts by their black painted hull until 2005, though they shared the same characteristics as them, being twin screw vessels constructed from moulded glass-reinforced plastic (GRP).  Operational Service  Explorer served for eight years as a RNXS tender with the pennant number A154 before being transferred to the Royal Navy upon the disbanding of the service in 1994. Upon joining the Naval service, the ship was assigned to the recently formed Yorkshire Universities Royal Navy Unit as its designated training vessel. The ships primary role is undergraduate sea training in support of the units programme of navigational skills and seamanship training, and this is accomplished through designated 'sea weekends' as well as Easter and Summer deployments, during which the ship deploys for up to five weeks. During these deployments, the five person ships company remain 'in theatre' while students are transported out to the ships location. After receiving a significant engine upgrade in 2014, the ships range was greatly enhanced and consequently in summer 2015 and 2016 Explorer has deployed to the Baltic Sea where the ship conducted a range of training and local engagements. Westland Sea King helicopter and Explorer, at the celebrations of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II on 4 June 2012 at the Humber Bridge In addition to the ships role as a training vessel, Explorer is also utilised by the Royal Navy for a range of ceremonial and other fleet tasking. The ships comparatively small size is an asset in this regard, allowing the Royal Navy to \\"show the White Ensign in places that larger vessels cannot reach\\". Recent examples of this include regular cooperation with Humberside Police and Humberside Search and Rescue in the Humber, as well as ceremonial operations including providing transport for dignitaries including members of the royal family at the Battle of Jutland Centenary commemorations in June 2016, and acting as guard ship for the 2016 Sunderland Air Show. The ship also takes part in public engagement events in order to raise the profile of the Royal Navy and provide a Naval presence where tasking or size limitations make other ships unsuitable.

Explorer, along with the other 13 URNU-assigned Archer class vessels, is assigned to the 1st Patrol Boat Squadron (1PBS) under the operational command of Commander 1PBS. As such, they are assigned to the Portsmouth flotilla, although in practise most vessels are based elsewhere. Explorer is one of three P2000s whose home port is not a Royal Navy or Royal Navy Reserve establishment, along with (Wales URNU) and (Cambridge URNU) which are based in Penarth Marina, Cardiff, and Ipswich marina, respectively.

Key goals of MCC studies include the derivation of molecular and cellular explanations of cognitive processes, as well as finding mechanisms and treatments for cognitive disorders. Although closely connected with behavioral genetics, MCC emphasizes the integration of molecular and cellular explanations of behavior, instead of focusing on the connections between genes and behavior. Unlike cognitive neuroscience, which historically has focused on the connection between human brain systems and behavior, the field of MCC has used model organisms, such as mice, to study how molecular (i.e. receptor, kinase activation, phosphatase regulation), intra-cellular (i.e. dendritic processes), and inter-cellular processes (i.e. synaptic plasticity; network representations such as place fields) modulate cognitive function. Methods employed in MCC include (but are not limited to) transgenic organisms (i.e. mice), viral vectors, pharmacology, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, in vivo imaging, and behavioral analysis. Modeling is becoming an essential component of the field because of the complexity of the multilevel data generated. Scientific roots The field of MCC has its roots in the pioneering pharmacological studies of the role of NMDA receptor in long-term potentiation and spatial learning and in studies that used knockout mice to look at the role of the alpha calcium calmodulin kinase II and FYN kinase in hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial learning. The field has since expanded to include a large array of molecules including CREB. Foundation of the field MCC became an organized field with the formation of the Molecular Cellular Cognition Society, an organization with no membership fees and meetings that emphasize the participation of junior scientists. Its first meeting took place in Orlando, Florida on November first, 2002. , the society had organized numerous meetings in North America, Europe, and Asia, and included more than 4000 members.

Background Royal Charger was a chestnut horse sired by the important stallion Nearco. His dam, Sun Princess, was a descendant of the famous broodmare Mumtaz Mahal. He was owned by Sir John Jarvis and trained by his unrelated namesake Jack Jarvis at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career Royal Charger failed to win as a two- year-old in 1944, but showed some promise when twice finishing second. As a three-year-old, he finished third in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 9 May, beaten a neck and two lengths by Court Martial and Dante. Later that year, he was placed in the Duke of York Stakes and won the Challenge Stakes. As a four- year-old, Royal Charger won the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Ayr Gold Cup (carrying 133 pounds). Stud career Retired after his four-year- old racing season in 1946, Royal Charger was sold to the Irish National Stud for ¬£52,000. There, he sired a number of important horses before being purchased in 1953 by American George D. Widener, Jr., who brought him to stand at his Old Kenney Farm (now Green Gates Farm) in Lexington, Kentucky. A three- quarters brother to the important sire Nasrullah, which also was brought to Kentucky from England, Royal Charger sired more than 55 stakes winners. Among his Irish progeny was Turn-To, which also was sent to the U.S., where he was the leading juvenile sire in 1958, notably through his colt First Landing. Other offspring included: * Copenhagen, four-time leading sire in New Zealand * Happy Laughter, winner of the 1953 1000 Guineas * Gilles de Retz, winner of the 1956 2000 Guineas * Idun, 1957 U.S. Champion two-year-old filly and the 1958 U.S. Champion three-year-old filly * Mongo, the 1963 U.S. Champion Male Turf Horse * Royal Duchy, Phoenix Stakes, Lowther Stakes * Royal Native, the 1959 U.S. Champion three-year-old filly, 1960 U.S. Champion Handicap Mare * Royal Orbit, Preakness Stakes * Royal Palm, Nunthorpe Stakes * Royal Serenade, Nunthorpe Stakes, Hollywood Gold Cup * Sea Charger, Irish 2000 Guineas, Irish St Leger In addition, Royal Charger was an important broodmare sire of more than 70 stakes winners, including Crowned Prince, the 1971 Champion two-year- old colt in England; the 1969 U.S. Champion two-year-old filly, Tudor Queen; and U.S. Hall of Famer Majestic Prince.

Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalytic theory, developed his concept of resistance as he worked with patients who suddenly developed uncooperative behaviors during sessions of talk therapy. He reasoned that an individual that is suffering from a psychological affliction, which Freud believed to be derived from the presence of suppressed illicit or unwanted thoughts, may inadvertently attempt to impede any attempt to confront a subconsciously perceived threat. This would be for the purpose of inhibiting the revelation of any repressed information from within the unconscious mind.  History  Having developed the theory of resistance through his direct experiences with patients undergoing therapy, Sigmund Freud noticed that patients would avoid subjects and topics that struck too closely to uncomfortable memories or unacceptable emotions and desires. Freud then integrated these findings with his previous theories concerning the functions of the id, ego and super-ego. As a result, he eventually advanced his concept of resistance by developing it into a multitude of individual forms that included repression, transference, ego-resistance, \\"working-through\\", and self-sabotage. The common theory behind many of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic techniques, alluding to the fundamentals of psychoanalysis as a science, was that it is possible that memories that have been lost from consciousness provide hints of their existence by the means of prompting certain thoughts and behaviors. Accordingly, the aim of psychoanalysis is to bring what is unconscious or preconscious into consciousness through verbalization. Afterwards, the act of bringing such thoughts into consciousness prevents them from motivating behavior and thus allowing the individual to exert more personal control. In an early exposition of his new technique, Freud wrote that \\"There is, however, another point of view which you may take up in order to understand the psychoanalytic method. The discovery of the unconscious and the introduction of it into consciousness is performed in the face of a continuous resistance on the part of the patient. The process of bringing this unconscious material to light is associated with pain, and because of this pain the patient again and again rejects it\\".Freud, S. (1959). \\"Freud's psycho-analytic procedure\\". In J. Strachey (Ed. & Trans.) The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. 7, pp. 249‚Äì270). London: Hogarth Press. (Original work published in 1904.) He went on to add that \\"It is for you then to interpose in this conflict in the patient's mental life. If you succeed in persuading him to accept, by virtue of a better understanding, something that up to now, in consequence of this automatic regulation by pain, he has rejected (repressed), you will then have accomplished something towards his education ... Psychoanalytic treatment may in general be conceived of as such a re-education in overcoming internal resistances\\". Primary/secondary gains from illness in resistance Although the term resistance as it is known today in psychotherapy is largely associated with Sigmund Freud, the idea that some patients \\"cling to their disease\\" was a popular one in medicine in the nineteenth century, and referred to patients whose maladies were presumed to persist due to the secondary gains of social, physical, and financial benefits associated with illness.Leahy, R. L. (2001). Overcoming resistance in cognitive therapy. New York: Guilford Press. While Freud was trained in what is known as the (secondary) gain from illness that follows a neurosis,Sigmund Freud, On Psychopathology (Middlesex 1987) p. 252 he was more interested in the unconscious processes through which he could explain the primary gains that patients derive from their psychiatric symptoms.Fenichel, O. (1945). The psychoanalytic theory of neurosis. New York: Norton.Wolitzky, D. L. (2003). \\"The theory and practice of traditional psychoanalytic treatment\\". In A. S. Gurman & S. B. Messer (Eds.) Essential psychotherapies (2nd ed., pp. 24‚Äì68). New York: Guilford Press. The model he devised to do so suggests that the symptoms represent an unconscious tradeoff in exchange for the sufferer being spared other, experientially worse, psychological displeasures, by way of what Freud labeled a compromise formation; \\"settling the conflict by constructing a symptom is the most convenient way out and the one most agreeable to the pleasure principle\\".Sigmund Freud, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 429. Thus, contrasting the primary gain (internal benefits) and secondary gain (external benefits) from illness, Freud wrote: \\"In civil life illness can be used as a screen to gloss over incompetence in one's profession or in competition with other people; while in the family it can serve as a means for the other members and extorting proofs of their love or for imposing one's will upon them ... we sum it up in the term 'gain from illness' ... But there are other motives, that lie still deeper, for holding on to being ill ... [b]ut these cannot be understood without a fresh journey into psychological theory\\".Freud, S.

(Original work published in 1926.) Resistance as the product of conflicting agencies To Freud, the primary gains that stood behind the patient's resistance were the result of an intrapsychic compromise, reached between two or more conflicting agencies: \\"psychoanalysis ... maintains that the isolation and unconsciousness of this [one] group of ideas have been caused by an active opposition on the part of other groups\\".Freud, Psychopathology, p. 109. Freud called the one psychic agency the \\"repressing\\" consciousness,Freud, S. (1959). \\"Further remarks on the defense neuro- psychoses\\". In E. Jones (Ed.) & J. Riviere (Trans.)

The compromise the two competing parties strive for is to achieve maximum drive satisfaction with minimum resultant pain (negative reactions from within and without). Freud theorized that psychopathology was due to unsuccessful compromises ‚Äì \\"We have long observed that every neurosis has the result, and therefore probably the purpose, of forcing the patient out of real life, of alienating him from actuality\\"Freud, S. (1959). \\"Formulations regarding the two principles in mental functioning\\". In E. Jones (Ed.) & J. Riviere (Trans.) Collected Papers (Vol. 4, pp. 13‚Äì21). New York: Basic Books.

Key players in the Kompromissl√∂sung theory of symptom production, at the core of Freud's theory of resistance, were: repression (often used interchangeably with the term anticathexis), defense, displeasure, anxiety, danger, compromise, and symptom. As Freud wrote, \\"The action undertaken to protect repression is observable in analytic treatment as resistance. Resistance presupposes the existence of what I have called anticathexis.\\"Freud, S. (1959). \\"Inhibitions, symptoms, and anxiety\\". In J. Strachey (Ed. & Trans.) The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (Vol. 20, pp. 75‚Äì175). London: Hogarth Press. (Original work published in 1926.)  Forms of resistance  In 1926, Freud was to alter his view of anxiety, with implications for his view of resistance. \\"Whereas the old view made it natural to suppose that anxiety arose from the libido belonging to the repressed instinctual impulses, the new one, on the contrary, made the ego the source of anxiety\\".Freud, Psychopathology, p. 320. Freud still understood resistance to be intimately bound up with the fact of transference: \\"It may thus be said that the theory of psycho-analysis is an attempt to account for two observed facts that strike one conspicuously and unexpectedly whenever an attempt is made to trace the symptoms of a neurotic back to their source in his past life: the facts of transference and resistance. Any line of investigation, no matter what its direction, which recognizes these two facts and takes them as the starting- point of its work may call itself psychoanalysis, though it arrives at results other than my own\\".Freud, S. (1959). \\"On the history of the psycho-analytic movement\\". In E. Jones (Ed.) & J. Riviere (Trans.) Collected Papers (Vol. 1, pp. 287‚Äì359). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1914.) Indeed, to this day most major schools of psychotherapeutic thought continue to at least recognize, if not \\"take as the starting-point\\", the two phenomena of transference and resistance.Beutler, L. E., Moleiro, C. M., & Talebi, H. (2002). \\"Resistance\\". In J. C. Norcross (Ed.), Psychotherapy relationships that work: Therapist contributions and responsiveness to patient needs (pp. 129‚Äì144).

Resistance: Psychodynamic and behavioral approaches. New York: Plenum Press. Nevertheless his new conceptualisation of the role of anxiety caused him to reframe the phenomena of resistance, to embrace how \\"The analyst has to combat no less than five kinds of resistance, emanating from three directionsthe ego, the id and the superego\\".Freud, Psychopathology, p. 319. He considered the ego to be the source of three types of resistance: repression, transference and gain from illness, i.e., secondary gain. Freud defined a fourth variety, Id resistance, arising from the id, as resistance that requires \\"working-through\\" the product of the repetition compulsion. A fifth, coming from the superego and the last to be discovered, \\"... seems to originate from the sense of guilt or the need for punishment\\"i.e., self-sabotage. All these serve the explicit purpose of defending the ego against feelings of discomfort, for, as Freud wrote: \\"It is hard for the ego to direct its attention to perceptions and ideas which it has up till now made a rule of avoiding, or to acknowledge as belonging to itself impulses that are the complete opposite of those which it knows as its own.\\"  Repression  Repression is the form of resistance where the ego pushes offensive memories, ideas, and impulses down into the unconscious. Essentially, the patient is unconsciously hiding memories from the conscious mind.  Transference  Typically unconscious, transference is when the patient allows past experiences to affect present relationships. In therapy, this may come about if the therapist reminds the patient, either consciously or unconsciously, of someone in their past who may have had an early impact on their life. Subsequently, the patient may suddenly tend to regard the therapist in either a positive or negative manner, depending upon the nature of the past influence.  Ego-resistance  This form of resistance is a neurotic regression to a proposed state of childlike safety. Usually, it involves the patient's attempts to gain attention and sympathy by emphasizing minor medical symptoms (i.e. headaches, nausea, and depression).  Id resistance  Id resistance is the opposition put up by the unconscious id against any change in its accustomed patterns of gratification. Id resistance reflects the unconscious desire for consistency in a manner that is based upon the pleasure principle. Since the id is an innate portion of human instinct, interpretation of the conscious is an insufficient method, thus the psychoanalyst must first be able to surmount resistances by the means of deduction of patients' unconscious defenses that are presented through exploitation of the mechanism of transference. Freud's analysis As Freud's clinical practice progressed, he noticed how, even when his patients' conscious minds had accepted the existence of, and begun working through their neurotic patterns, they still had to deal with what he called Id resistance: \\"the resistance of the unconscious...the power of the compulsion to repeat ‚Äì the attraction exerted by the unconscious prototypes upon the repressed instinctual process\\".S Freud, On Psychopathology (PFL 10) p. 319-20 Later developments W. R. D. Fairbairn saw id resistance in terms of early attachment to an internalised bad object, so that the individual remained bound by ties of yearning towards, and anger at rejection by, the repudiating parent of childhood.M Stark, Working with Resistance (2002) p. 96-7 Id resistance manifests itself in group therapy in three main psychosexual forms: oral-level id resistance might take the form of an obsequious dependence on the therapist's words, or alternatively express hostility in cutting, biting remarks;L Rosenthal, Reading Resistance in Group Psychotherapy (1993) p. 88-9 anal hostility can be displayed in dumping material indiscriminately on the therapist; and phallic-level id resistance appears in the form of competition with, and/or seductive ploys towards, therapist and other group members.L Rosenthal, Reading Resistance in Group Psychotherapy (1993) p. 89 Acting out and acting in of id resistances in group therapy need to be contained by an emphasis on words as the central means of therapeutic interaction.L Rosenthal, Reading Resistance in Group Psychotherapy (1993) p. 90 Eric Berne saw personality in terms of a life-script laid down in early childhood, and considered that the main obstacle to recovery in therapy \\"is the pull of the script, something like the Id resistance of Freud\\".E Berne, What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (Corgi 1974) p. 311  Superego resistance  Superego resistance is the opposition put up in therapy against recovery by the patient's conscience, their sense of underlying guilt. It prompts personal punishment by the means of self-sabotage or self-imposed impediment. It has been considered by some (though not by Freud)\\"The most obscure though not always the least powerful one\\", S Freud, On Psychopathology (PFL 10) p. 320 the weakest form of resistance, reflecting the moralistic sentiments of the superego. Freud's late formulation Freud in the twenties came belatedly to the realisation of the importance of an 'unconscious morality' in opposing his therapeutic aims.J Malcolm, Psychoanalysis (London 1988) p. 30-2 Thereupon he divided the sources of resistance into five, pointing out that \\"The fifth, coming from the super-ego and the last to be discovered‚Ä¶seems to originate from the sense of guilt or need for punishment\\".S Freud, On Psychopathology (PFL 10)p. 320 However he also pointed out how often the patient does not feel guilty so much as unwell, when their superego resistance is in operation.S Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 391 Subsequent developments Object relations theory tended to see superego resistance in terms of a patient's relationship with an internalised critical/persecutory parent figure.J Sandler, The Patient and the Analyst (1992) p. 113 Reluctance to end the 'security' of the bond to the internalised parent strengthens the superego resistance.S Grand, The Modern Freudians (1999) p. 33 Where the ego ideal is harshly perfectionist, or represents an internalised mother who idealised suffering over enjoyment,H Strean, Psychoanalytic Approaches to the Resistant and Difficult Patient (1985) p. 92-3 superego resistance takes the form of a refusal to be 'corrupted' by the progress of the therapy.O Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 310 In group therapy, superego resistance may be externalised or internalised. In the first case, a moralistic sub-group may form, which is hypercritical of other, less conformist members; while in the second case (of internalisation), the severity of the inward conscience, and the need for punishment, may lead to action destructive to the self and to the progress of the treatment.L Rosenthal, Resolving Resistance in Group Psychotherapy (1993) p. 18 and 88  Freud's treatment of resistance  Freud viewed all five categories of resistance as requiring more than just intellectual insight or understanding to overcome. Instead he favored a slow process of working through. Working through allows patients \\"... to get to know this resistance\\" and \\"... discover the repressed instinctual trends which are feeding the resistance\\" and it is this experientially convincing process that \\"distinguishes analytic treatment from every kind of suggestive treatment\\".Freud, S. (1959). \\"Further recommendations in the technique of psychoanalysis: Recollection, repetition, and working through\\". In E. Jones (Ed.) & J. Riviere (Trans.) Collected Papers (Vol. 2, pp. 366‚Äì376). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1914.) For this reason Freud insisted that therapists remain neutral, saying only as much as \\"is absolutely necessary to keep him [the patient] talking\\", so that resistance could be seen as clearly as possible in patients' transference, and become obvious to the patients themselves.Freud, S. (1959). \\"Further recommendations in the technique of psychoanalysis\\". In E. Jones (Ed.) & J. Riviere (Trans.) Collected Papers (Vol. 2, pp. 342‚Äì365). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1913.) The inextricable link suggested by Freud between transference and resistanceFreud, S. (1959). \\"The dynamics of the transference\\". In E. Jones (Ed.) & J. Riviere (Trans.) Collected Papers (Vol. 2, pp. 312‚Äì322). New York: Basic Books. (Original work published in 1912.) perhaps encapsulates his legacy to psychotherapy.  Applications  Psychoanalysis is, altogether, considered to be a type of insight-oriented therapeutic program. Despite general initial reservations, these types of programs have since transitioned from being quite marginal to becoming more well-known and mainstream. In consideration to the theory of resistance itself, within a clinical setting, the expression of resistance is considered to be a significant stage to recovery because it reveals the presence of repression. Additionally, it is indicative of progress in the effort of resolving any underlying issues that may be the cause of personal dysfunction. As resistance is theorized to be a manifestation of the unconscious mind's attempts to protect the ego, it is the task of the psychoanalyst to combat this opposition by directing the patient to confront the unacceptable desires or uncomfortable memories. By this course of action, the patient may reach a cathartic conclusion.  Criticisms  Psychoanalysts and their critics remain divided with regard to the concept of resistance. Since Freud first developed his theory of resistance, he has been significantly criticized for using personally favorable and unfalsifiable theory, among other problems.As early as 1932, psychoanalyst S√°ndor Ferenczi wrote: \\"The possibility should not be rejected out of hand that the analyst's habit of identifying any obstacle encountered as resistance on the part of the patient can be misused in an equally paranoid, that is, delusional, way for the projection or disavowal of his own complexes.\\" For example, if a patient were to agree with a psychoanalyst's inference about themselves, it is a confirmation that there is something they are repressing; however, if the patient disagrees, it is also a sign they are engaged in repression, which means the psychoanalyst is correct in either scenario (see also: Gaslighting, Kafkatrap). Additionally, some relational psychoanalysts believe that the success of psychoanalysis is not due its various explanatory systems or its reasoning about repression, but rather simply due to the process of interpersonal communication.

Life and career Lind was born at her parents' residence in Birmingham, England, and was christened at Saint Thomas church. Her father, Henry Rudge, was a brass founder and chandelier maker. Her mother, Elizabeth Rudge, was an actress whose career was brief and confined mostly to the Birmingham area. Lind was one of the Rudge Sisters, all of whom became well-known performers. Lind also had two brothers who were brass founders.Cruickshank, p. 5 Early career Lind first appeared on stage when she was about five years old as Eva in Uncle Tom's Cabin, then toured with American entertainer and writer Howard Paul and his British wife, Mrs Howard Paul from about the age of ten. The Pauls billed her as \\"La Petite Letitia.\\" Howard Paul became Lind's lover and fathered two illegitimate children by her: a girl who died in infancy (1878) and a son (Henry Horace Howard Paul Rudge (1880‚Äì1969), a tobacco merchant).Mrs. Paul left her husband about 1877, in view of the affair, but continued to perform under the name Mrs. Howard Paul. She died in 1879. See Cruickshank, p. 5 Lind made her first London appearance under the name \\"Letty Lind\\" in Howard Paul's farce, Locked Out at the Princess's Theatre in 1879. In 1881, Lind left Paul's company. It is not clear exactly when their relationship ended, but Paul married Florence Kate Arthur in 1889.Cruickshank, p. 9 After leaving Paul's company, Lind appeared in London and the British provinces for over twenty years in comedy, farce and pantomime. Lind's first appearance at the Gaiety Theatre was in December 1880 as a background performer in The Nine Days' Queen by Robert Buchanan. In 1882, she played at the Olympic Theatre in The Exiles of Erin, and in Little Miss Muffet at the Criterion Theatre. She returned to the Gaiety in 1882 in A Madcap Prince. She spent much of the next year at Her Majesty's Theatre in a revival of Jacques Offenbach's Le voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon). She continued to tour the UK for the next few years in Robert Buchanan's drama Storm Beaten, the pantomime Queen of Hearts and George Faucett Rowe's Fun in Bristol, among other shows. Lind performing a skirt dance in 1890 In 1887, Lind began her long and successful association with George Edwardes at the Gaiety Theatre in a series of burlesques, beginning with Monte Cristo Jr., taking over the role of Mariette, which was created by Lottie Collins. Collins devised her own cross between skirt dancing and the Can-Can in her performance of her hit song 'Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay'. It was around this time that Lind fans began to number in the \\"tens of thousands\\" as her fame was spreading.W. Macqueen-Pope, Gaiety, Theatre of Enchantment, W. H. Allen, 1949, p. 254 Later in 1887, Lind played in Miss Esmeralda at the Gaiety. She was on loan to Augustus Harris's company at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane for the Christmas pantomime, playing the princess in Puss in Boots. With George Edwardes's London Company, she spent most of 1888 and part of 1889 in Australia and the United States. Back in London, she starred in Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√© (1889), Mercedes in Carmen up to Data (1890), Euphrosynea in The Bride of Love (1890; her cymbal dance was a highlight of the production),Review of Bride of Love and the title role in Cinder-Ellen Up Too Late (1891). She also appeared in a number of charity events. Around this time, Lind became famous as a skirt dancer. Skirt dancing, popularised by Kate Vaughn in the 1880s, was a huge craze until around 1910. It fused the grace of ballet with the footwork of step-dancing, which was considered common and lacking in grace. The dance depended on the dancer's skill in manipulating up to 12 metres of fabric in the skirt of her costume. Skirt dancing's advantage over ballet was that people could do it at home, and it became popular among all social classes. Lind was able to differentiate herself from other skirt dancers because she had the benefit of classical training that most of them did not, and she often added an acrobatic touch to the end of her dances. When she danced in America in 1888, the critics were surprised to see a dancer who did not show her legs and breasts.Cruickshank, p.4 Musical comedy and later career Lind as Maude in Morocco Bound Lind as Iris in A Greek Slave By 1892, burlesque was losing popularity, and musical comedy was taking over the London stage. Though Lind's singing voice was limited, it was said to be pretty, and she used it to its best advantage, becoming a popular musical comedy performer. Lind's first musical comedy role was at the Shaftesbury Theatre as Maude in Morocco Bound (1893). Morocco Bound was a great success. It was transferred to the Trafalgar Square Theatre in January 1894, and continued to run for a total of 329 performances. During the run of Morocco Bound, Lind published a short story in The Pelican. It was the tale of how a dancer coped during a performance when her petticoat string broke.Cruickshank, p. 21 In 1894 she wrote the music for a song, \\"Dorothy Flop\\", that her sister Adelaide Astor performed in a production of The Lady Slavey. The lyrics were written by Adrian Ross.Cruickshank, p. 26 She then played in Pick-me-up (1894, with George Grossmith, Jr. and Jessie Bond). After this, Lind rejoined George Edwardes's management to star at Daly's Theatre in a series of hit musicals: A Gaiety Girl (1894, as Alma Somerset), Go-Bang (1894, as Di Dalrymple), An Artist's Model (1895, as Daisy Vane), The Geisha (1896, as Molly Seamore), and A Greek Slave (1898, as Iris). Lind received excellent reviews for her roles in these musicals, emphasising the grace of her dancing, her comic acting, her enunciation and her abilities at mimicry and imitation.Cruickshank, pp. 19‚Äì31 Lind continued to appear at benefits, including ones for Edmund Payne and Nellie Farren,\\"Letty Lind as Columbine, Drury Lane Theatre, 17 March 1898\\", Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 28 August 2016 and in her own music hall shows, singing her repertoire from her famous roles. She sang in the music halls for only a few months. In 1899, Lind is believed to have made her only appearance at the Palace Theatre, London, in a programme celebrating Charles Morton's 80th birthday.The Entr'acte, 15 July 1899, p. 5 That same year, she again performed the princess in the pantomime Puss in Boots, this time at the Garrick Theatre.Cruickshank, p. 34 Lind also played Clotide in The Gay Pretenders by George Grossmith, Jr. at the Globe Theatre (1900) and Ellen in The Girl from Kays at the Apollo Theatre (1902), her last performance in a West End show. In 1903, Lind returned to the stage to try her luck again in the music halls. Lind made her final public appearance at the Gaiety Theatre, singing one of her first hits, \\"Listen to my tale of woe\\" from Ruy Blas. It was part of the last-night performance at the Old Gaiety, which was demolished soon afterwards. She retired from performing at the age of 41. Last years and family details Lind spent the rest of her life in Slough, England, living a peaceful life on the farm.O'Connor, T. P., MP, \\"Personal Recollections\\" in The Daily Telegraph, 28 August 1923. Lind was the best known of the five Rudge Sisters.Cruickshank, pp. 5‚Äì6 Sarah Rudge, professionally known as \\"Millie Hylton\\" (1870‚Äì1920), worked in the theatre and the music halls making a name for herself as a male impersonator. Elizabeth Rudge, a West End actress professionally known as \\"Adelaide Astor\\" (1873‚Äì1951), married George Grossmith, Jr. in 1895. Lydia Rudge, professionally known as \\"Lydia Flopp\\" (1877‚Äì1963), appeared in pantomimes. The youngest Rudge Sister, Fanny Rudge, had a long and successful career in Australia under the name \\"Fanny Dango\\" (1878‚Äì1972). Besides her son with Howard Paul, she had another son, John R. H. Rudge (b. 1892), whose father was acknowledged to be the third Earl of Durham. It is not clear when her relationship with Durham began, but it is clear that it continued throughout her life. Lord Durham wanted to marry Lind, but was unable to do so because of the divorce laws. His wife had been in an insane asylum for years, and he was unable to break his marital ties to her.Hollander, Bertie, Before I Forget. Grayson & Grayson, London, 1935, p. 11. Lind died at her residence at Brookside, Salthill, Slough, at the age of 61, having become ill rather suddenly that year. Her obituary from The Times said, \\"She was very pretty; she was very graceful; there was something appealing about her which might almost be called childish. She had a queer and very attractive little croak in her voice, and an elementary, little-girlish way of saying things which made them peculiarly engaging, and caused her saying of them to stick in the memory with a permanence which their wit or point might by no means justify. Add to this the enchanting lissomeness and beauty of all such movements as she was mistress of, and a stage personality (as we call it) which was like no one else's, and there is more than justification for the glow which the remembrance of her performances kindles.\\" Lind's funeral took place at St. Mary's Church, Slough, on Friday, 31 August 1923, and she was buried in Windsor Cemetery.

Its exact location is uncertain. Classical writers located it where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are closest together and it was mentioned along with Kish in early records. Archaeologists in the 1900s placed Akshak at the site of Tel Omar (or Tel Umar) where a pair of sites straddles the Tigris, but that turned out to be Seleucia (possibly earlier Upi/Opis) when it was excavated by LeRoy Waterman of the American Schools of Oriental Research, though a fragment with the name Akshak was found there.George A.

She foundered on the night of 30 January 1895 following a collision in the North Sea with the loss of 334 lives. Construction and early history The Elbe had a 3-cylinder compound engine which provided power to her single- screw propeller. She was a fast ship for her time, being able to reach the speed of 15 knots, but small cargo capacity, along with her high consumption of coal, would soon make her uneconomical. She had a straight bow, two funnels and four masts.Ship's description She was launched on 2 April 1881, the first of a series of eleven express steamers known as the \\"Rivers Class\\", as they were all named after German rivers. After sea trials she made her maiden voyage on 26 June 1881, leaving Bremen for New York City via Southampton. The Elbe had accommodation for 179 First Class passengers, 142 in Second Class, and 796 in Steerage. She was a very popular ship with immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe to the United States and was virtually always sold out in steerage. The Elbe spent most of the next ten years working the North Atlantic service, but she also made three voyages to Adelaide in Australia, two of which were in December 1889 and 1890.

SS Elbe had left Bremerhaven for New York earlier in the day with 354 passengers aboard. Also at sea on this rough night was the steamship Crathie, sailing from Aberdeen in Scotland, heading for Rotterdam. As conditions grew worse, the Elbe discharged warning rockets to alert other ships to her presence. The Crathie either did not see the warning rockets or chose to ignore them. She did not alter her course, with such disastrous consequences, that she struck the liner on her port side with such force that whole compartments of the Elbe were immediately flooded. The collision happened at 5.30 am and most of the passengers were still asleep. The Elbe began to sink immediately and the captain, von Goessel, gave the order to abandon ship. Amid great scenes of panic the crew managed to lower two of the Elbe's lifeboats. One of the lifeboats capsized as too many passengers tried in vain to squeeze into the boat. Twenty people scrambled into the second lifeboat, of whom 15 were members of the crew. The others were four male second-class passengers and a young lady‚Äôs maid by the name of Anna Boecker, who had been lucky enough to be pulled from the raging sea after the first boat had capsized. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Elbe, Captain von Goessel had ordered all the women and children to assemble there but no other lifeboats were launched because the ropes on the derricks were all frozen up, and so they perished along with the captain. Within 20 minutes of the collision, the Elbe had sunk and the only survivors were the 20 people in the one surviving lifeboat. These people now had to endure mountainous seas and below-zero temperatures and they were 50 miles from land. Things looked bleak; the Elbe's distress rockets had not been seen by any passing vessels and so no one knew of their predicament. After five hours in the raging storm, their luck changed. A fishing smack from Lowestoft called the Wildflower found them. In desperate conditions the crew of the Wildflower struggled to pull the 20 survivors from the lifeboat, which had begun to break up. The skipper, William Wright, said later that the survivors would not have lasted another hour in those conditions, and believed that the only reason they had stayed alive for five hours was the expertise of the Elbe's crewmen aboard the lifeboat. Steamship Crathie The Crathie was a steamer of about 475 tons gross and 272 net. She left Rotterdam with general cargo for Aberdeen on 29 January 1895 carrying just 12 hands. The Craithie was also badly damaged in the collision and returned to Rotterdam flying signals of distress. When later asked why they had not stayed on to help the Elbe and her passengers, the captain, Alexander Gordon, said that he feared that his ship would sink, and in any case he did not hear any cries for help coming from the liner. It appeared to him that the Elbe was steaming away from his position. New York Times report 1 May 1895 Crash cover of a letter salvaged from the sunk SS Elbe in 1895 Miss Anna Boecker Of the twenty who survived the sinking, only one was a female. Anna BoeckerMiss Boecker's evidence, New York Times, 27 February 1895 was a shy, quiet maid in the employment of an elderly lady, travelling with her employer to Southampton. In the panic and confusion of the collision she had been unable to save her employer. She joined the terrified crush of passengers lowered into the first lifeboat. When it capsized under the sheer weight of numbers, Anna ended up in the ocean. All the others from her lifeboat clambered back onto the sinking ship. Anna was alone in the treacherous sea until the survivors in the second lifeboat spotted her foundering in the water and pulled her up to safety. Repercussions The SS Elbe incident resulted in a court case which took place in Rotterdam in November 1895. The court found that the steamship Crathie was alone at fault for the collision. Amazingly the captain was merely censured for leaving the disaster, a verdict that astounded the maritime world at the time. The blame was put squarely on the first mate, who had left his post at the bridge at the critical time to chat in the galley with other crew members, and therefore had failed in his job of operating the ship's warning lights. The captain, officers and sailors of the SS Elbe received no rebuke from the court either, which caused some concern amongst the German public. The crew of the fishing smack Wildflower each were given, by Kaiser Wilhelm II, a silver and gold watch bearing his monogram and ¬£5 as a gesture of thanks for saving the lives of the eighteen German citizens, an Austrian, and the English pilot. They also received other medals and gifts in the following years. List of rescued passengers and crew members Passenger Anna Boecker from Bremen Passenger Carl A.

The Motte probably dates back to the 11th Century when it was a Norman fortification but over time was subject to neglect. Bury Mount looking north west from the banks of the River Tove, May 2008Bury Mount in July 2012 after restoration with the Mill Stream off the River Tove in the foreground Location The Motte is in Moat Lane in the Roman town of Towcester, England, located on the Roman Road of Watling Street now the A5 trunk road which runs from Dover to Wroxeter via London. It is similar to other local Mottes located at Northampton, Buckingham, Little Houghton and Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. It would have been strategically placed to control primary transport routes and river crossings. The Towcester Motte controlled the junction of Watling Street and long distance route from Southampton to Stamford which went through Winchester, Oxford, Brackley and Northampton, now the A34 and A43 trunk roads. The Motte is located in Towcester on the north- east side of the A5 in Moat Lane, at the side of Towcester Town Hall next to St Lawrence Church and near the Forum Building which is the Home of South Northamptonshire Council; the mount also lays east of the market square. Bury Mount can also be reached by walking down Castle Lane which is off of Watling Street. Construction It comprised a small bailey and a tall motte surrounded by a large ditch. The motte may not have been of the standard conical mound form. More historical details are described on the South Northant's Council's website including the restoration project for the motte and all the Moat Lane area. History The most likely period for its construction was the Great Anarchy period (1135‚Äì1152), when England was divided between the supporters of King Stephen and Empress Maud. It was about the time that the Manor of Towcester passed from the Crown to the St. Hiliary family. The castle would have been used as a symbol of power, been the residence of the lord of the manor's bailiff or reeve, an encampment for troops and cavalry raised during periods of hostility and offer hospitality to the lord and his retinue whilst travelling. It was to be dominated by a large motte surrounded by a ditch and topped by a tower which created both a stronghold and a watchtower. Documentary evidence shows that in the 15th century there was a gate at the junction of the two lanes leading into the bailey. In this area would be living quarters for the constable of the castle and the small permanent garrison, detached kitchens, a brewhouse, barns and sheds for storage of food and equipment, stabling, privies, a well and accommodation for livestock. It would have been tightly packed with buildings and would have bustled with activity when fully garrisoned. The traditional view is that earth mottes had palisades around the summit of the motte which was approached by a flying bridge or ladder and within this well defended upper section would have been a tall timber tower. The few excavations of mottes that have occurred show they varied considerably in form. There is the possibility that Bury Mount does not follow the standard form. In 1392 it was described as a mound tower within a moat, which suggests that it would have had a stone tower as a wooden tower is unlikely at that date. Shortly before 1824, possibly whilst they were excavating away the south-west section of the mount to construct a cottage, a \\"subterraeneous arched passage fifteen yards in length\\" was found. These two documentary sources suggest that the motte may have been of a similar type to the motte excavated at South Mimms, Hertfordshire in the 1960s. Although the South Mimms motte looked like a typical castle earthwork they found that \\"the tower was set within the motte, and the entrance to the castle was gained via a tunnel through the motte into the tower\\". Most of the mound at South Mimms had been revetted so that little of the motte was visible. It was probably built around 1141 by the Earl of Essex. If the Towcester motte is of this form then it would be rare survival. In 1392, during the ownership of Reginald de Grey, Baron Grey of Ruthyn, a record of the manor in Towcester was made. Within the castle site was the manorial hall aligned north-south, which would have housed the bailiff and important guests and also be the place where the manorial court was held. It had chambers at both ends. The southern chamber, facing towards the gate appears to have been principal first-floor chamber, usually called a solar, which like the Hall had a stone slated roof. The other chamber was thatched, suggesting that it may have been the bailiff's accommodation. Adjacent was a detached kitchen which with a stable attached. Both were thatched with straw. There were two great barns which were \\"at a distance\\" plus an oxhouse with stable and carthouse under one roof, a dovecote and a sheepfold for 200 sheep. In the late 15th century the Manor castle appears to have been vacated and a new Manor House constructed in Park Street Towcester. Part of this building still survives and is known as the Mint House. In the winter of 1643/4 Towcester became the winter headquarters of the Royalist cavalry under Prince Rupert. The town was re-fortified and Bury Mount was converted into a platform for 2 cannon which was probably slighted when the Royalists left in the spring of 1644. From then on Bury Mount was used as an orchard and then as gardens for a cottage built at the foot of the mound. The cottages have now been demolished. Restoration The remains were restored in 2008 with an access ramp, landscaping around the River Tove and mill stream and explanatory plaques. During 2013-2016 South Northamptonshire Council implemented the Moat Lane Regeneration Scheme which centred on the Mount. This saw the building of the Forum to which the district council relocated in early 2015, plus homes and small retail units. There is also renovation of other older historic buildings in the area and empty cottages which are in Moat Lane.

Some are featured more frequently than others. Ad-Lib Poetry The host gives a line of a poem, and each panelist has to continue the poem, continuing to speak until a buzzer sounds, at which point it goes to the next panelist. Tim Brooke-Taylor is reported to have expressed a strong hatred for this game. Backwards A song is played backwards, and the panelist has to guess what the song is. The Bad-Tempered Clavier Panellists attempt to sing a song perfectly in tune while Colin Sell plays wrong notes, changes key and changes tempo. The name is a play on The Well-Tempered Clavier, and the game is identical to an exercise used by the father of the composer Charles Ives to train his son. Points are deducted from players who attempt to sing with their fingers in both ears. Blues Each team has to improvise a blues song on a topic given by the other team, such as the \\"Trichologist's blues\\" or the \\"Kerry Packer blues\\". The songs invariably started with \\"I woke up this morning\\". The only exception was when one team had to sing the \\"I couldn't get to sleep last night blues\\". A variation was to improvise a madrigal or a calypso. The calypsos invariably started with \\"I [something relating to the topic] the other day\\". Board-o Panellists play a board game on the radio. It combines features of the UK edition of Monopoly, Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, Operation, Jenga, chess, and solitaire, among others. Call My Bluff A variation on the TV series Call My Bluff in which panellists all invent bluff definitions of words. However, unlike the original version, in which participants had to define obscure words, in the ISIHAC version, players had to define common words such as \\"porcupine\\". The winner was the \\"most convincing and least embarrassing\\". Censored Song Panelists, in teams of two, are given perfectly innocuous songs; the objective is to make the song as suggestive as possible by the strategic censoring (via a buzzer) of innocent words. For example, \\"I Whistle a Happy Tune\\" was censored to become \\"Whenever I feel a[buzz] / I hold my [buzz] erect / And whistle a happy tune / so no one will suspect I'm a[buzz]\\". Sometimes the game is played by having one team sing the song and the other buzz; alternatively, the teams are given the original recording to buzz. Extreme examples include Cryer and Garden's rendition of \\"My Favourite Things\\" (\\"[buzz-buzz] and [buzz-buzz] and [buzz-buzz] and [buzz-buzz], / [buzz-buzz] and [buzz-buzz] and [buzz-buzz] and [buzz-buzz], / [buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz], tied up with strings: / these are a few of my favourite things\\"), \\"All Through the Night\\" (all words buzzed out except for \\"All through the night\\") and \\"Walking in the Air\\" from The Snowman (many instances of \\"I'm [buzz]ing...\\"). The game saw a brief revival in an episode broadcast in January 2016, with Cryer and Rob Brydon singing censored medleys, with Cryer's medley incorporating \\"It's Not Unusual\\", \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" and \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" (\\"I've got you under my [buzz], I've got you deep in the [buzz] of me, so deep in my [buzz] that you're really a [buzz-buzz-buzz]...\\"), while Brydon's medley included \\"I'm Into Something Good\\", \\"Feed the Birds\\" (\\"[buzz] the birds, tuppence a [buzz]...\\") and \\"We Will Rock You\\". The game was left in abeyance after Barry Cryer and his partner played the supreme example, which would never be bettered. This was a rendition of \\"Grandfather's Clock\\". It only required one buzz and the innuendo lasted for the whole of the rest of the song. \\"Grandfather's [buzz] was too large for the shelf, so it stood 60 years on the floor...\\" The game may be based on a recurring sketch from I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again in which songs by Rolf Harris (22 March 1970 episode), Tom Jones (5 April 1970 episode), and Julie Andrews (26 April 1970 episode) were \\"censored\\" (for example, \\"Two little boys had two little [buzz], each had a wooden [buzz]\\"). Channel 5 Children's Hour From the early days of Channel 5, when the station was notorious for transmitting mild pornography early in the morning. The panellists are asked to imagine how the channel would treat a variety of children's programmes. Previously called Channel 4 Children's Hour. Cheddar Gorge The panelists take turns to say a word each, the ostensible object being to avoid completing a sentence: each word must leave the possibility of the sentence being completed in a grammatically correct and meaningful manner. When a grammatically correct sentence has been formed, the player who added the final word is eliminated. Play continues with the remaining players starting a new sentence. The last player left is the winner. In many playings, the chairman will assign a word for each player to use into the sentence. For example, in one playing the teams had to tell the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, with Tim Brooke-Taylor having to fit in the word \\"stethoscope\\", Graeme Garden \\"iPad\\", Marcus Brigstocke \\"Brazilian\\" and Barry Cryer \\"porridge\\". These words were often shoehorned in regardless of the sentence structure, leading to much laughter from the audience. As is usually the case on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, the game is not played seriously. The sentence ending rule is largely ignored, and the end of the sentence is declared almost entirely arbitrarily by Lyttleton sounding his horn. The sentences constructed are always long and unwieldy, and the panelists play for laughs on several levels. The sentences are often nonsensical, including as many silly turns of phrase as possible. If a panellist is stuck, they will often say \\"comma\\". During one game, guest panelist Bill Bailey received a laugh for using the phrase \\"Open brackets\\". The origin of the game's name is obscure. Lyttleton often commented that it clearly outlines the game's principles, and mentioned other games named after geographic features or cheeses. In recent series, the game has been replaced with \\"Letter Writing\\". However, it was played by Jack Dee and Jeremy Hardy in the Christmas special Humph in Wonderland, and has been sporadically played since series 55. Ciryl This game, one of the many singing rounds on the programme, encourages the panel to sing a song backwards, such as \\"Adorable, you're A\\" or \\"Better Do Can I, Do Can You Anything\\". Indeed, the name Ciryl is \\"lyric\\" spelt backwards. Panelists usually take one line each and sing the words the correct way round, but in reverse order. The game is introduced as having occurred to Lyttleton when he was walking through Finsbury Park, which he refers to as \\"Krapy Rub Snif\\". Complete Bellocs In this game, Jack Dee reads the first two lines of a rhyming couplet telling a cautionary tale in the style of Hilaire Belloc, for each team member to complete. These are usually completed with another couplet, but occasionally carry on a bit longer. Cow, Lake, Bomb A variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors, using sound effects. Each team must select a sound effect (from a moo, a splash, and an explosion). The rules say that \\"Cow drinks lake, lake extinguishes bomb, bomb blows up cow\\". The game almost always ends up being abandoned as the teams play their sound effects, and Lyttleton or Dee failing to distinguish which team played which, and soon degenerating into the teams playing masses of sound effects on top of each other. Other variants of this game are Cat, Duck, Splash, where \\"cat eats duck, duck floats on water, water drowns cat\\", and Match, Canary, Fart, where \\"a match lights a fart, canary eats a match and a fart gasses a canary.\\" DIY Drama This round requires the teams to improvise an episode of a drama series in a specific genre. Genres seen so far include soap opera, science fiction, costume drama and detective fiction. Scene-setting sound effects are used to make the improvisation more difficult. Double Feature This round takes as its premise the poverty of the international film industry, for economic reasons new films are being remade as combinations of two or more old films. For example, remaking High Noon with E.T. and calling it High Tea. This kind of economy was taken to an extreme with The Magnificent Seven Dwarves for Seven Samurai. The game frequently strayed into television, a notable example being Tim saying the makers of Three of a Kind, The Odd Couple and One Man and His Dog provide the audience for Channel 4. Common variations on the game include merging two or more television shows, plays or novels. Another variation was to make cuts to films, novels, plays or television shows to reflect economic conditions, e.g., One Foot in the Grave becomes One Inch in the Grave, Lady Chatterley's Lover becomes Lady Chatterley's Penpal and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia becomes Bring Me the Hat of Alfredo Garcia. In later shows the literary variation was announced as \\"Wuthering Hillocks\\". Dysfunctional Duets Similar to \\"The Singer and the Song\\", except that one member of the team sings the song \\"straight\\", and the other responds to each line. Examples include \\"Underneath the Arches\\", sung by Flannagan and Alan Whicker (in which Willie Rushton as Whicker is unable to comprehend the existence of a poor person) and \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\" by Peter, Paul and Mary Whitehouse (in which Sandi Toksvig as Whitehouse found double entendres in every line). One notable round had Brooke-Taylor singing \\"Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey\\", with Bill Bailey responding as \\"himself\\". Famous First Words The panelists suggest famous first words of famous people. An example is that Tim Brooke-Taylor commented that Magnus Magnusson's first words he ever said were, \\"I've started, so I'll finish.\\" Good News, Bad News One panellist gives a piece of good news, another gives a corresponding piece of bad news, then the next gives good news and so on. For example: \\"Good news, the Russians are putting a Briton into space\\", \\"Bad news, it's not Jeffrey Archer\\", \\"The good news is that it is Robert Maxwell\\", \\"Bad news, he's going to nobble the Sky satellite\\", \\"Good news, he'll succeed\\". Each cycle continues until the host presses a buzzer or makes a different sound. Historical Headlines The chairman identifies a historical event, such as the assassination of Julius Caesar, and invites the panellists to suggest the headlines that would be used by modern newspapers reporting on the event. Panellists make their suggestions in no particular order, leading to a fluid style of play. This game works well because of the United Kingdom's remarkable profusion of newspapers, representing many styles and viewpoints. The round uses caricatures, and often stereotypes, of the papers' views, such as the Daily Mails obsession with property values (e.g.: \\"William the Conqueror Invades England; House Prices Slump in SE\\"), the Daily Express and its obsession with asylum seekers, The Guardians reputation for bad spelling, the Sunday Sports regular reporting of sightings of Elvis, and the Evening Standards single-minded concentration on London-centric news, often concerning a tube strike. Other local newspapers can be used to give a parochial slant on an item. In the case of the death of Julius Caesar, the Lancashire Evening Posts headline (enunciated in lugubrious northern tones) was, \\"Mark Antony comes to Bury.\\" Hunt the Slipper One of the few games in which Lyttleton participated. He explains that, once blindfolded by Samantha, he must determine which panellist has the slipper. When he is ready, he cries \\"Slipper search on!\\" before making his decision, pointing to a panellist, and declaring \\"Slipper holder\\". Unfortunately, none of the panellists had been informed that they needed to bring a slipper, and the game was abandoned. Identify the Joke In this round, Colin Sell starts playing a song, which is a clue to a joke which Jack Dee has on his card. The teams' job is to buzz in, identify the song and tell a joke relating to the song. If everyone has incorrectly guessed the joke, Colin then proceeds to play another song as another clue. This continues until the joke has been correctly identified, or no one guesses correctly after three songs have been played, in which case Jack will tell the correct joke instead. Jigsaw Panellists try to complete a jigsaw puzzle, mainly in silence. Occasional comments are heard, such as \\"Is that an edge?\\" \\"No, it's a bush.\\" There are also moments when the noise of players trying to pound a piece into place by brute force is audible. Just a Minim A parody of Just a Minute, in which the contestants have to sing a song \\"without repetition, deviation, hesitation, anthrax or, er...repetition\\". The songs are chosen for having extremely repetitive lyrics (for instance \\"Old McDonald Had a Farm\\" or \\"This Ole House\\"), causing the contestants to have to think up ingenious synonyms. In the \\"Old McDonald\\" version, when Cryer used a variety of alternative turkey noises, Rushton challenged for failing to say \\"gobble\\" at all. Another time, Brooke-Taylor challenged for the repetition of the word 'I', which Lyttleton dismissed saying 'I' was too short. When it was Rushton's turn, he said 'I' in place of every word. The panellists often audibly struggle to stay within the rules; in many early playings of the game, a favourite tactic, especially of Graeme Garden, was to sing the chosen song 'straight' in the hopes of being challenged (and therefore relieved from the chore of singing). Jack Dee has added to the game since he began chairing by mimicking Nicholas Parsons's overenthusiastic speech style, overly congratulating the players for every challenge, the game itself \\"which is beloved across the cosmos\\", and paying respect \\"to Darth Vader who created this game.\\" He will sometimes talk at such length that the panellist, when finally asked what his challenge was, says \\"I've forgotten\\". Karaoke-Cokey The Plasma Display Board (upgraded from the old laser display screen) shows the name of a well known song, which the audience must hum, following an unrelated piano introduction from Colin Sell. Panellists simply have to identify the song. The fun of this song comes from the audience's self- conscious attempts to remain in time, often obscuring the song completely. The audience is left to its own devices regarding when to begin, and which part of the song to do. Most memorably, the audience once had to give a rendition of \\"Funky Gibbon\\", a hit for The Goodies, of which Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke- Taylor were members. Another notable round was recorded in Leeds, Yorkshire, where the tune was Flight of the Bumblebee; for this, instead of humming the tune, the whole audience simply buzzed and Graeme Garden guessed \\"Flight of the Warthog\\". The game was played during the live tour, but the audience were all given kazoos through which to hum the tunes given to them, thus hampering the Teams even more. Last Episode The object was to \\"put the last nail in the coffin of a long-running radio or television show and close the series in one line\\". For example, Rushton concluded Thunderbirds with \\"Brains says it's terminal Dutch elm disease\\" and Brooke-Taylor concluded The Two Ronnies with \\"It's goodnight from me, and it's goodnight from her\\". A variation involved unexpected or premature endings to well-known plays or films. Graeme obliged with \\"Godot! I wasn't expecting you so soon.\\" Late Arrivals (at a society ball) Until recently, the closing round is often \\"Late Arrivals at the such- and-such Ball\\" which descends directly from frequent incidental dialogue included in the earlier, scripted BBC Radio 4 series I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again. Late arrivals at the Drunkards' Ball could for example include Mr and Mrs Large-Whisky and their son Oliver (a pun on \\"I'll have a large whisky\\"). Adjectives were often used very effectively to qualify attendees' names, for example at the Bankers' Ball, \\"Mr and Mrs Dingrates, and their debauched son, Base Len\\". The names did not have to follow this format. The Politicians' Ball famously gave rise to: \\"Announcing the late arrival of... the Marquis de Sade and the party whips\\". A phrase which invariably provoked applause was, \\"It's Cabaret time!\\", followed by the name of a fictitious group or entertainer. One running joke (usually by Graeme Garden) is the appearance of Mr and Mrs Bennett - (Long phrase of exclamation relevant to the subject) - and their son Gordon, the joke being that this is an easy cop-out (e.g., at the Builders' Ball, Mr and Mrs Bennett-That's-Twice-The-Estimate...) which plays on the once-popular exclamation of surprise \\"Gordon Bennett\\". After the chairman has identified the ball, the panellists announce the late arrivals, in no particular order. Play is fast and fluid, often to the point that the chairman cannot end the show without shouting over the teams. One favourite from a very early show featured Lyttleton butting-in with: :\\"Ladies and Gentlemen, kindly SHUT UP for Mr and Mrs N-why-I-must-interrupt-is-that-we've-overstepped-the- bounds-of-decency-and-also-reached-the-end-of-the-series, and their daughter - Theresa!\\" Letter Writing / Eighty-Four Chicken Cross Road A development of Cheddar Gorge in which the teams improvise an exchange of letters between two famous persons, past or present, fictional or real, with each team composing one of the letters and with the two members of that team constrained to compose it by alternating one word at a time. This generally leads to letters developing in amusingly bizarre or lewd directions for which no one player can take full credit, and allows players to enjoy putting their teammates in awkward situations, for example by throwing in strings of conjunctions and adverbs to force their partner to keep supplying nouns and adjectives. An early name for the round, \\"84 Chicken Cross Road,\\" has come back into regular use as the round's title, its derivation never explained (though the reason probably lies in reference to 84, Charing Cross Road). Limericks In this game, which has not been played on the programme for several years, the chairman supplies the first line of a limerick, and the four panellists each improvise a line in turn to complete it. Usually four rounds are played, rotating the panellists so that they each get a turn supplying each possible line. This is the most serious of the games, in the sense that its ostensible object (to create a funny poem on the spot) is precisely the actual object for which the panellists are aiming. The game is a test of comedic and improvisational skill, and is difficult to do well. Out of four rounds, the ISIHAC panellists typically produce one or two really good limericks, with the remainder still being creditable. The audience especially applauded instances of players inventing rhymes which avoided obvious obscenities such as: \\"A small breed of dog is the Scotty It's house-trained and uses a potty He gives a loud \\"Yap!\\" That mischievous chap Then gets up and wipes his wee botty\\" A book containing a collection of the best limericks was published in 1999 as I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue: The Official Limerick Collection. Medical Complaints In this game, each team is given a medical condition to act out (which is also displayed to the audience on the laser display board) for the other team to guess. Symptoms have included Barry and Graeme thinking they are a man with two heads, Tim and Pippa Evans thinking that they are the M25, and Barry and Jo Brand thinking they are sound engineers on a BBC period costume drama, so they began mumbling inaudibly (a satirical nod to the controversy over the inaudible dialogue of the BBC's then-recent adaptations of Jamaica Inn and SS-GB). Mornington Crescent This is by far the best-known ISIHAC game. Ostensibly it is an obscure game of extreme complexity, involving the naming of London Underground stations (or, sometimes, other London areas, roads, landmarks etc.) in convoluted patterns not readily discernible by the observer. A summary of the \\"rules\\" can be found in the main Mornington Crescent article. It is a very popular game for fans of the show to play themselves. An attempt was once made to play Mornington Crescent in Slough, rather than London. The game came to an abrupt end when Willie Rushton pointed out to Lyttleton that there was no Mornington Crescent in Slough. Game play is often preceded by the reading out of a \\"letter from Mrs Trellis of North Wales\\" in which Mrs Trellis writes, usually to a random celebrity, to ask a ridiculous question or make an incoherent comment. Name That Barcode Lyttleton reads aloud a barcode, and panellists attempt to guess what product the barcode comes from. For example, Lyttleton will read out some variation on ‚ÄúThick black, thin white, thin black, thin white very thick black‚Äù etc.; while panellists will usually suggest various joke products (such as a gadget enabling the user to see behind them while in church ‚Äì a rear pew mirror). Name That Motorway A clip is played of traffic passing, and panellists must figure out the motorway where it was recorded. As with Name That Barcode, the humour derives from the panellists‚Äô pretence that the game can be played seriously. A variant of this game is \\"Name That Author\\", where the teams have to guess a famous author from the sounds of a typewriter, computer keyboard or pen being used. Name That Silence Panellists listen to several seconds of silence, and try to determine the origin of the silence. Answers range from Jade Goody appearing on Mastermind, to an audience's reaction to a Bill Oddie nature programme or the Radio 4 continuity announcer falling asleep during Quote, Unquote. The game is also known as Dead Air. One Song to the Tune of Another In One Song to the Tune of Another, panellists sing the lyrics of a song to the tune of a completely different one. The simple idea is always 'explained' to the audience with an incomprehensibly elaborate and bizarre analogy which ends in complete confusion, and often a dig at Colin Sell. This is the epitome of inherently silly games, though to perform it without preparation can still involve a fair bit of skill. A laugh can be raised purely by Lyttleton's announcement of the two compositions, especially if they are from wildly differing genres: e.g., The Undertones' \\"Teenage Kicks\\" to the tune of \\"Jerusalem\\". It was the very first game played by the teams on the very first episode of ISIHAC, back in April 1972. Opera Time Panellists turn a bland piece of prose, such as the instructions for a board game or the installation manual for a hot water heater, into grand operatic duets. This often included operatic maniacal laughter between lines. A similar version of this game can be found in The 99p Challenge, another Radio 4 panel game, which draws heavily on ISIHAC's influence. Paranoia One team suffers from a delusion but they don't know what it is (the mystery delusion is revealed to the other team and the audience by the Laser Display Board and the Mystery Voice). They ask questions of the other panel to find out the mystery delusion. Examples of delusions include \\"They think the King's Singers want to kill them\\" or \\"They think they are Jason Donovan\\". A variant of this is called Scandals, where the teams have to guess which scandal they are embroiled in. For example, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Jeremy Hardy had to guess they'd been implicated in the cash for honours scandal, and Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden had a worse indignity of having to guess they'd accepted a booking for Quote, Unquote. This led to Brooke-Taylor asking Cryer and Garden if they'd \\"given up on comedy\\". Pick- up Song The panellist sings along to a well-known song. The sound of the song is turned off for a period while the panellist continues to sing. The aim is to be as close as possible to the original when it's turned on again. This round is rarely included on the BBC Radio Collection CDs of the series, owing to reproduction rights on the original recordings. It appeared on CD for the first time on the 2008 release I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue Live 2. Along with Mornington Crescent and Sound Charades, this is one of the games where the introduction has acquired a life of its own, and is the only segment in which points are discussed by Lyttleton, who promises to award points to anyone who is \\"Within a gnat's crotchet\\" or \\"a midge's minim\\". He then recites Bruce Forsyth's catchphrase from Play Your Cards Right: \\"Points mean prizes ‚Äì what do points mean?\\", to which the audience yells, \\"Prizes!\\" As time has moved on, Lyttleton has begun to replace \\"prizes\\" with more elaborate descriptions (\\"Points mean surprises\\", \\"Points mean sumptuous extravagant prizes\\", or \\"Points mean the junctions on railway lines\\"). When asked \\"What do points mean?\\", some of the audience responds by shouting what Lyttleton has just said, and the rest shout \\"Prizes!\\" regardless. Alternatives include \\"Pets Win Prizes, what do pets win?\\", and \\"I've seen prizes, what have I seen?\\". (On one occasion, the line became \\"Points mean prizes ‚Äì what does moronic bellowing mean?\\" The audience obligingly roared, \\"Prizes!\\") In a 2007 episode, Lyttleton began the usual introduction, before interrupting with \\"what we used to do, in the old days, was I then said something about points being awarded, and I used to say 'What do points mean?' (Audience obligingly roars \\"Prizes!\\") But we don't do that anymore\\"; and on another occasion, he responded to the roar of \\"Prizes!\\" by telling the audience to \\"go off and invade Czechoslovakia.\\" Prizes include such luxury items as a reptile that wakes you up in the morning (an alarm croc) or lawn seed to help make your garden look bigger (magnifying grass). In the game itself, the panel, and in some cases the audience, participate in some of the musical renditions. As few of the participants can really sing, the round can have additional humour value. However, the applause when someone actually comes close to keeping up with the original song is clearly a genuine recognition of achievement. Rob Brydon's ability to mimic Tom Jones and to keep up exactly with his song \\"Delilah\\" on the Monday 26 June 2006 programme received one of the loudest and longest ovations in the programme's recent history. Despite playing the game to perfection, Lyttleton nonetheless failed to award Brydon any points. On one occasion when Barry Cryer kept up exactly, despite having broken into fits of giggles halfway through, he was told by Lyttleton \\"In snooker, it's usual to apologise for a fluke.\\" In the last episode of the 2006 series helium was used to aid Tony Hawks in impersonating Pinky and Perky, and Brooke-Taylor in impersonating Ann Stephens. When the sound was brought up on the Ann Stephens recording, however, the needle turned out to be stuck. In the same episode, Garden was asked to sing along to \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\" by Scissor Sisters. Garden's son John \\"JJ\\" Garden performs occasionally with the group at live gigs. A variation on this game, announced as \\"Radioke\\" (a combination of radio and karaoke), was for panellists to read along to a radio recording such as a wartime speech by Winston Churchill or the football results by James Alexander Gordon. On a few rare occasions it was found that, when the song was faded back in, the record had in fact moved onto the next track. The panelists are far more likely to be too fast than too slow. Pin the Tail on Colin Sell Based on Pin the Tail on the Donkey, panellists are challenged to pin a tail on pianist Colin Sell. This translates on radio to several minutes of Sell playing tunes on the piano, before shrieking in pain as the tail is pinned on him. Declared by Lyttleton to be one of his favourite games, adding, \\"Next time, maybe we‚Äôll try it with a blindfold.\\" Quote... Misquote (formerly Complete Quotes or Closed Quotes) In this game the teams are given the beginning of a quotation from a famous person or a passage from a book, and must complete it. The answer they come up with is always humorous, and usually a comment on the person quoted. For instance, Lyttleton once introduced this round with the famous quote \\"I have in my hand a piece of paper...\\", finished with \\"Will someone pass another roll under the door please?\\" The game was later named \\"Quote... Misquote\\" as a parody of the genuine Radio 4 quotation game Quote... Unquote. Lyttleton will sometimes say that points are deducted for correct answers. A variation is for players to complete proverbs (e.g., Lyttleton: \\"A fool and his money are ...\\"; Garden: \\"...welcome at Lloyds\\" or Lyttleton: \\"Rome wasn't built in ...\\"; Rushton: \\"Norway\\".), local sayings, song lyrics, snatches of poetry, public notices (e.g., at airports or railway stations) or instructions (e.g., on domestic appliances or medicine bottles). A later variation was for a recording of a famous personality to be played and stopped in mid sentence. Players then completed the sentence. For example, a recording of John Major: \\"I go whenever I can, which isn't as often as I would wish. But really I...\\"; Garden: \\"...can thoroughly recommend Ex-Lax\\". In one 2006 episode the game was retitled \\"Incomplete Sentences\\", and said to be \\"based on an idea by the Home Secretary\\". Singing Relay A team sings a well known song with each panellist singing alternate words. The winner is the team that best keeps in time with the piano. The task is difficult at the best of times; it was often reduced to hilarity by Lyttleton's selection of songs such as \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\". It was played again in 2006, introduced as It's A Four Part Singing Relay Knockout Competition Game Sans Frontier. This time, all four panellists had to sing a song one word at a time. Panellists were eliminated for long pauses or for coming in too early or at Lyttleton's whim, which lead to Jeremy Hardy doing his words on \\"Run Rabbit Run\\" alone. Sound Charades In Sound Charades, a team of two panellists is given the title of a book, film, or other artistic work, and they must communicate it to the other team by means of acting out a very short improvised play. Usually the title to be communicated is a contorted pun on the central object in the play, which has (of course) not been explicitly named but only described indirectly. For example, the film Zulu has been acted out by a whispered question being answered with directions that pass several animal enclosures ‚Äì the questioner has been given directions to the 'zoo loo'. Another example: for Dirty Harry, the entire clue went 'Potter!' (as in Harry Potter) 'Sir?' 'Don't do that' (reference to famous Joyce Grenfell catch-phrase) The game also provides Lyttleton with the regular opportunity to make fun of Lionel Blair, long-standing team captain on Give Us a Clue, the TV show from which Sound Charades is said to have been derived. This usually involves some sort of outrageous innuendo such as \\"Who wouldn't have been moved to watch the tears of frustration well up in Lionel's eyes at being unable to use his mouth to finish off Two Gentlemen of Verona?\\". Una Stubbs, another regular captain on Give Us a Clue, is also occasionally mocked in this way, for example when Lyttleton recalled \\"the occasion on which Una Stubbs, her hands a blur, managed to pull off Three Men in a Boat in under ninety seconds\\". However, despite its association with Give Us a Clue, and its seeming divergence from the actual rules of Charades, the game is actually a much older and more obscure version of Charades in which speaking was allowed. Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden often tell their story as two elderly Scottish gentlemen, Hamish and Dougal. It is in essence a minute-long improvised sketch where each performer knows the other well enough to be able to set up joint jokes seamlessly. Each sketch is started with the line \\"You'll have had your tea\\", with which (un)welcome visitors who have a habit of dropping in at dinnertime are reputed to be greeted in Edinburgh, Scotland. (In Scotland and the north of England, the evening meal, typically called dinner in the south, is usually called tea; this can sometimes lead to confusion.) This is done either to deter scroungers or because the person in question is quite tight-fisted himself. A spin-off on BBC Radio Four, You'll Have Had Your Tea, gave the two characters their own series. One occasion saw a team come to the end of their \\"four-word\\" charade, only for Lyttleton to pipe up \\"It's The Last of the Mohicans: that's five words,\\" thus giving away the answer. In a 2012 episode, Jeremy Hardy correctly guessed Skyfall before the charade had actually started; Cryer and Garden proceeded to play out the charade anyway. Stars in Their Ears (formerly The Singer and the Song) Panellists sing a popular song in the style of a famous personality, such as a politician or television presenter. For example, \\"Wannabe\\" in the style of John Prescott, \\"Sisters\\" in the style of The Queen and Princess Margaret or \\"Hallelujah\\" in the style of George Formby. The combination of singer and song is sometimes chosen for superficial appropriateness (as with \\"Sisters\\") or lack thereof (as with \\"My Favourite Things\\" performed by Darth Vader); sometimes because the song emphasises (or is impeded by) the vocal mannerisms of the subject (as with \\"Wannabe\\"); and sometimes simply as a play on names (for instance \\"What a Wonderful World\\" as performed by Neil Armstrong, rather than Louis Armstrong, or Queen's \\"We Are the Champions\\" as performed by the Queen). One memorable moment occurred when Willie Rushton had to sing \\"Jerusalem\\" as Eartha Kitt, and halfway through he launched into an impression of Orson Welles before interspersing some of \\"Santa Baby\\" into the song. Following the end of his song, Lyttleton declared that he couldn't give Rushton any points as he \\"didn't know what he was doing\\". The game title \\"Stars in Their Ears\\", used in later series, is a play on Stars in Their Eyes. Straight Face In this game, panellists in turn announce words, and the audience is used to judge whether the word is funny. If the audience laughs, \\"even the merest hint of a titter\\", then the player who provided the offending word is eliminated. Often, the chairman will ignore words that produce enormous laughs, but will eliminate players whose words produce a barely audible laugh. The last player remaining wins. Lyttleton often noted that, as a game in which the players must avoid making the audience laugh, Barry Cryer has a huge advantage. Indeed, it has been claimed that Cryer has spent most of his life practising this game. It is possible to predict quite accurately which words will raise a laugh. Arguably this is because some words are inherently funny. Panellists actually take quite daring risks, skating the line between boring and funny words at the risk of elimination. This game can thus be played in a manner that involves considerable comedic skill, not only in judging inherent funniness but also in reading the audience and adjusting the timing and delivery of the word to get the intended effect. It can be viewed as stand-up comedy minus the jokes. One of Lyttelton's favourite memories is from this game when \\"as only he could, Stephen Fry brought the house down with 'moistly.BBC: Humphrey Lyttelton In the first episode of the autumn 2006 series, the panellists had to give the punchlines of jokes, with the laughs being inspired either because the audience knew them, or if not, their imaginations provided amusing scenarios. Since Jack Dee took over as chairman, the game was brought back initially as Sausages, then In My Pants. The aim of this variant was that whatever the panelists said had to be answered by Dee with \\"Sausages\\" or completed with \\"...in my pants\\", in order to make him laugh, earning panelists \\"bonus points\\". Swanee-Kazoo This is a musical game, and the game yielding by far the most bizarre sounds, thus making excellent radio. It is also inherently silly. As with most of the musical games, the panellists play in teams of two. One player is issued with a swanee whistle, and the other a kazoo. Note that the latter instrument is easy to play well, but the former takes some skill to produce a melody. Using these, they perform a well-known song as a duet. The humour principally derives from the sound of the instruments. Both have a characteristically absurd timbre, and the juxtaposition of the two is quite incongruous. Furthermore, the swanee whistle is not usually considered a melody instrument, more usually being employed for special effects (such as the voices of the Clangers). Typically, the kazoo player can hold the tune, thus keeping the performance together, while the swanee whistle produces a deranged version, often only hitting the right note by accident. It is typical, therefore, for the swanee whistle player to take the bulk of the performance. Possibly the most extensive use of the swanee whistle was the last in the summer 2006 series, where it was used almost exclusively to perform the melody for \\"Tequila\\", the kazoo (played by Barry Cryer) being used to supply the \\"Tequila!\\" Tag Wrestling The chairman gives each team a convoluted punchline, to which they must improvise an equally convoluted joke. However, once the first team has started telling their joke, the chairman will sound his buzzer at random intervals; at this point, the second team must take over, steering the story towards their punchline... until the chairman sounds his buzzer and the first team once more takes over the story, and so on. Themed Film/Book Club The chairman identifies a special interest group and invites the panellists to suggest films or books that would be of interest to it. The titles suggested are mostly modifications of well-known film/book titles to create a themed pun, thus the builders' book club might feature \\"Grout Expectations\\", a pun on Great Expectations. Some of the suggestions are more elaborate, including puns on the author's name or explanations of their topicality. As with the other common final rounds, the suggestions are made in no particular order. For unknown reasons, the film variant of this game nearly always features a reference to Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (e.g. at the Gardeners' Film Club, \\"Bring Me the Shed...\\", or in the Golfer's Film Club, \\"Bring Me the Wedge...\\"), invariably uttered by Graeme Garden. Other variants of this game include themed songbooks (using song titles, where Barry Cryer will almost invariably come up with some variation on Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious) and Radio Times (with radio and television programmes). In the latter, any version of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue itself is, of course, guaranteed to produce a round of applause. In the second episode of the 51st series, a new variant was played, in which the panellists named various speciality shops. Trail of the Lonesome Pun The panelists come up with trailers for different radio and television programmes which have been commissioned solely on the basis of having a pun in the title. For example, Brooke-Taylor trailed a documentary presented by former cricket umpire Dickie Bird lamenting the decline of the full toss and beamer bowling moves, titled Nobody Gives a Toss. Uxbridge English Dictionary (formerly New Definitions) The panellists must suggest alternative definitions for existing English words. For example, \\"lymph\\" has been redefined as \\"to walk with a lisp\\", or crackerjack has been said to be \\"a device for lifting biscuits\\". During one round of the game, Stephen Fry suggested that 'countryside' should mean 'to kill Piers Morgan'. The game has recently been renamed Uxbridge English Dictionary to tie in with a book of that title collecting the definitions made in the round. The game is known outside of ISIHAC as \\"daffynitions\\", and bears a strong similarity to the entries from the fictional Dictionary for Today that occasionally featured in Beachcomber, as well as Douglas Adams' whimsical dictionary of redefined place-names, The Meaning of Liff. An early variation of the game required new definitions for foreign terms or phrases which have become common in English. Graeme Garden memorably redefined \\"apres-ski\\" as \\"plaster of paris\\" or, \\"I've Finished the Yoghurt\\". There is another running joke found in this game, this time by Barry Cryer, by saying how Sean Connery would say something, for example: \\"pastiche - what Sean Connery eats in Cornwall\\" (pasties), or \\"twinge - what Sean Connery calls children of the same age\\" (twins). This game considerably predates the foundation of the Roger's Profanisaurus, and both are descended from the concepts behind Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary in an arc that fans of ISIHAC are likely to consider \\"literary\\". For certain, low, values of \\"literary\\". Where Am I? Lyttleton was blindfolded by Samantha, and the teams play sound effects in an attempt to help him guess a location. Lyttleton's mind tended to wander during this round, or occasionally he fell asleep. Panellists have questioned why Lyttleton insists on being blindfolded for the game. Word for Word This is based on word association, an investigative technique in psychology which can be used as a game. In the word association game, players in turn say whatever word comes into their mind first after hearing the previous word. \\"Word for Word\\" is a word disassociation game: players may say any word as long as it has no connection whatsoever to the previous word. This is surprisingly difficult to do. This game produces amazing strings of nonsense. Furthermore, as with the other elimination games, the elimination rule is not strictly followed. Fairly direct links between words are occasionally permitted, but words may be deemed connected based on bizarre and tortuous chains of association. For example, in one episode, a player said \\"cardigan\\" and the next \\"pier\\". Another then said \\"Cardigan has a pier\\" and was corrected: \\"Cardigan was a peer\\". One of the next few words was \\"pullover\\", and was buzzed because \\"you can pull over to see Cardigan's pier\\". Barry Cryer has a notable tendency to take two consecutively uttered words, such as \\"skimp\\" and \\"leave\\", put them together and claim that there was a 1960s rock band with this name.I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue 10, Disc 2 (London Victoria Palace) For instance, the words \\"aubergine\\" and \\"favourite\\" were connected thus, in the 30th Anniversary Special, where Cryer then corrected himself, saying it was in fact \\"Aubergine Vincent\\". In more recent series, Colin Sell would start playing on the piano, forcing Cryer to improvise a song on the spot based upon the link he had found. Because connections are allowed between words that are not uttered consecutively, one way to play the game (favoured by Garden) is to say alternate words that are all connected. In one round, Garden and Cryer gave the sequence \\"shampoo\\", \\"dilatory\\", \\"conditioner\\", \\"fecund\\", \\"hair\\", at which point they were stopped when Tim Brooke-Taylor pointed out that \\"a hair, out of Graeme, drops off every fecund\\". A running joke established in recent series is that Graeme Garden, when told that it is his turn, would reply \\"me?\\" When Jack Dee confirms \\"yes\\", Garden would say \\"That was my word.\\" This is sometimes followed up: the next time Garden is told it is his turn, he would say \\"again?\\" Upon being told \\"yes\\", he would again explain that that was his word.

She is a Lifespan Patrol Vessel type boat and formerly served in inland waterway duties in Northern Ireland as MV Grey Fox. She was acquired to serve with the Gibraltar Squadron, tasked with policing, customs and search and rescue duties. This released an patrol vessel for tasking with the Cyprus Squadron. Operational history Scimitar was involved in a diplomatic incident between the United Kingdom and Spain in November 2009 after being alleged by the Spanish to have been using the Spanish flag as a target during gunnery practice. The Ministry of Defence stated that the ship had actually been shooting at a NATO maritime signal flag, which is similar in appearance. On 3 May 2011 Scimitar was dispatched to intercept the Spanish patrol boat when she entered British waters around Gibraltar and ordered the Spanish ship to leave the area. Scimitar took part in another encounter with a Spanish naval vessel on 4 April 2017. It challenged Infanta Cristina, a that had entered British waters off of Gibraltar. Infanta Cristina left without further incident. On 8 November 2017, HMS Scimitar intercepted the Spanish corvette Infanta Elena trying to enter British territorial waters off Gibraltar. Replacement In July 2017 it was revealed that the Gibraltar Squadron would receive two new warships which will be more \\"capable\\", \\"faster\\" and have \\"bigger guns\\", to replace Sabre and Scimitar \\"within the next two years\\". As of the 24th July 2020, an announcement has been made that the promised two new warships have been ordered from Marine Specialised Technology (MST Ltd) with the first to be delivered in (Q3 2021/22) and the second in (Q1 2022/2023). The contract is expected to cost at least ¬£9.9 million. The patrol vessel replacements are initially going to be armed with X3 General Purpose Machine Guns (1 on the foredeck and 2 on the aft deck) as well as being fitted for but not with a 0.50 cal Heavy Machine Gun.

HMS Sabre On Friday 10 April 2009 a vessel from Spain's Civil Guard Police force entered Gibraltar territorial waters unannounced and approached the area near Gibraltar's airport. HMS Sabre approached, and there was no response from the Spanish vessel. It was warned to leave the territorial waters, and after consulting with its superiors it did so. However, accounts vary between the Royal Navy and the Spanish versions. The Royal Navy states that its guns were loaded at the time, however the Spanish accounts state that the guns were specifically pointed at the Spanish vessel. In addition, Spanish MP Jose Ignacio Landaluce from the People's Party vowed to take up the issue in parliament. He said Spain \\"would not allow a Civil Guard vessel to be expelled from its own home\\". In May 2016 Spain's Civil Guard Police force vessel Rio Cedena twice tried to cut across the path of the submarine in Gibraltar territorial waters. HMS Sabre fired warning flares to deter the Spanish vessel. Replacement In July 2017 it was revealed that the Gibraltar Squadron would receive two new warships which will be more \\"capable\\", \\"faster\\" and have \\"bigger guns\\", to replace Sabre and Scimitar \\"within the next two years\\". As of the 24th July 2020, an announcement has been made that the promised two new warships have been ordered from Marine Specialised Technology (MST Ltd) with the first to be delivered in (Q3 2021/22) and the second in (Q1 2022/2023). The contract is expected to cost at least ¬£9.9 million. The patrol vessel replacements are initially going to be armed with X3 General Purpose Machine Guns (1 on the foredeck and 2 on the aft deck) as well as being fitted for but not with a 0.50 cal Heavy Machine Gun. The ships are going to be 19 metres long, carry 6 crew and 6 passengers and travel at 40 knots.

James Freeman (April 22, 1759 ‚Äì November 14, 1835) was the minister of King's Chapel in Boston for 43 years and the first clergyman in America to call himself a Unitarian. Unlike New England liberal Congregationalist ministers, who approached Unitarianism through Arianism, he was Socinian in theology and developed links with Unitarians in England. Early life Freeman was born April 22, 1759 The Christian Examiner January, 1836, p.385-393. to Lois Cobb and Constant Freeman in Charlestown, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. His father was a sea captain turned merchant. James received his secondary education at the Boston Latin Grammar School, where he studied under the well-known schoolmaster, John Lovell. He attended Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1773‚Äì77 and, despite the disruptions caused by the Revolutionary War, for a time afterwards pursued theological studies as a graduate resident. After graduation Freeman prepared a company of men from Cape Cod for service in the Revolutionary army. In 1780 Freeman chartered a small ship bearing a cartel (a safe-conduct) and took his sister and brother to Quebec to rejoin their father, who lived there at that time. En route, he was captured by a privateer and confined in a prison ship in Quebec for several months. He then remained in Quebec on parole until 1782. By the end of his life, he was fluent in French, Latin, Italian, and Spanish. Religious life After he had candidated at various Boston pulpits, in 1782 the Episcopalians at King's Chapel asked Freeman to officiate as their reader for six months. Founded in 1686, King's Chapel was the first Church of England parish in New England. The Rector, Henry Caner, a Loyalist, had been forced to leave in 1776 when the British troops evacuated Boston. After the departure of his assistant a few months later, the Chapel was closed for about a year. In 1777 the Chapel proprietors gave permission to the members of the Old South Church (Congregational), who had been displaced from their own meetinghouse by the British, to worship in King's Chapel. Because of anti-British sentiment, it was popularly known as Stone Chapel. Before long, the original congregation returned to the Chapel, and the two societies, one Episcopalian and one Congregational, shared the facilities until 1783 when the Old South Church congregation returned to its newly renovated building. Freeman was well liked at Stone Chapel. When his six months were concluded, at Easter 1783, the proprietors asked him to be Pastor of the Church. Before he accepted the position of Reader at Stone Chapel, he requested that he not have to read the Athanasian Creed. As the Episcopalians were not particularly fond of the creed, the congregation readily consented. After reading Joseph Priestley's An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1782) and Theophilus Lindsey's An Historical View of the State of the Unitarian Doctrine and Worship from the Reformation to our own Times (1783), Freeman began to further doubt the doctrine of the Trinity and became increasingly uncomfortable with the liturgy in the Book of Common Prayer. Having adopted the Socinian Unitarianism of Priestley and Lindsey, he rejected the pre-human existence of Jesus. (Others who were soon to be known as Unitarians, the Arian liberal Congregationalists of New England, accepted the pre-existence of Jesus.) He told his closer friends at the Church that he could not conscientiously perform the service as it stood. He wondered if he should relinquish his position as pastor. One of his friends suggested that he present his dilemma to the congregation, and let them decide. Beginning in 1784 Freeman preached a series of sermons on the unity of God, stating his dissatisfaction with certain parts of the liturgy, and giving his reasons for rejecting the Trinity. He thought that these would be the last sermons he would ever give there. To his surprise, he was heard patiently, attentively, and kindly. He persuaded the Church to alter the liturgy, eliminating all references to the Trinity and addressing all prayers to God the Father. The Chapel was the first church in America to make such changes. On that ground, it might be considered the first Unitarian church in the country. Freeman found support for his ideas from the English Unitarian, William Hazlitt, who visited Boston in 1784. Hazlitt promoted Freeman's ministry and told him that he thought lay ordination scriptural. While the liberal Congregationalists tried to distance themselves from Hazlitt, both personally and theologically, Freeman gave him his friendship and said, \\"I bless the day when that honest man first landed in this country.\\" As the congregation at Stone Chapel wished to remain connected with the Episcopal Church, in 1786 they sent a request to Bishop Samuel Seabury to have Freeman ordained as their rector. Because of the controversy surrounding the changes that had been made to Stone Chapel's liturgy, Seabury replied that he would require the recommendation of his presbyters. After interviewing Freeman and confirming that he did not subscribe to the Trinity, the presbyters denied his application for ordination. A more liberal-minded clergyman, Samuel Provoost, bishop-elect of New York, also declined his support. The wardens of the church then took it upon themselves to arrange a lay ordination. In 1787 Freeman was made \\"Rector, Minister, Priest, Pastor, and Ruling Elder\\" of Stone Chapel. A group of Episcopal clergymen in the area published a statement protesting \\"against the aforesaid proceedings, to the end that all those or our communion, wherever disposed, may be cautioned against receiving said Reader or Preacher (Mr. James Freeman) as a Clergyman of our Church, or holding any communion with him as such, and may be induced to look upon his congregation in the light, in which it ought to be looked upon, by all true Episcopalians.\\" A flurry of letters ensued, many of which were published in the local newspapers. One man even suggested that the \\"heretics\\" ought to be burned at the stake, as in the old days. The wardens of Stone Chapel, as well as the majority of the congregation, supported their new pastor in every way they could. Freeman himself kept aloof from the dispute and the controversy gradually subsided. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1793. Freeman promoted Unitarianism outside the Stone Chapel as well. He donated to libraries tracts that had been sent to him by Lindsey. In 1792 a Unitarian congregation was formed in Portland, in the district of Maine, by an Episcopalian minister and friend of Freeman, Thomas Oxnard, to whom Freeman had given books by Lindsey and Priestley. His preaching in Baltimore in 1816 led to the organization of the Unitarian church there, at which William Ellery Channing gave his famous 1819 sermon. He met every two weeks with about twenty liberal ministers in the Boston area, mostly Congregational, for discussions relating to religion, morals, and civic order. Freeman was appointed to a committee charged with considering the creation of a formal body. The work of this committee led, in 1825, to the founding the American Unitarian Association. In 1809, at Freeman's request, Samuel Cary was brought in as a colleague at the Chapel. Cary, however, died in 1815 at only 30 years of age. Freeman again served the congregation alone until 1824, when Francis W. P. Greenwood was brought in to assist him. Greenwood later succeeded him. In 1811 the Chapel revised its liturgy once again, incorporating changes that Freeman had wanted to make in 1785, but for which he had then thought the congregation not ready. That same year Harvard gave him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. One of the founders of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Freeman served as its recording secretary from 1798-1812. He was a member of the American Humane Society, the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences, and the Massachusetts Peace Society. He served on the Boston School Committee for many years beginning in 1792 and was a delegate at the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention, 1820-21. Later life Freeman, who preferred the country to the city and was devoted to horticulture, lived in Newton, Massachusetts part of the year, residing in Boston during the winter. When he married Martha Clarke in 1783, he accepted her nine-year-old child, Samuel, as his own. In 1811, when they moved to Boston, Samuel and his wife Rebecca left their third son, James Freeman Clarke, later another influential Unitarian minister, under the care of James and Martha. Although the arrangement was supposed to be temporary, the boy ended up staying with his grandparents for the rest of his childhood. In 1826, because of poor health, Freeman was encouraged by his physician to retire. He then resided full-time in Newton, where he was often visited by parishioners and friends. He died November 14, 1835, at the age of 76. He was buried at Newton Cemetery. His wife Martha, who died in 1841 at the age of 86, lies in the Freeman tomb next to her husband.

Retrieved 2019-01-09. is a federally designated national forest region located primarily in Montgomery County, but also extending into Randolph and Davidson counties in south central North Carolina. It is the smallest of the four National Forests in North Carolina, with a total area of . About 79% of its acreage is in Montgomery County. The forest is managed together with the other three North Carolina National Forests (Croatan, Nantahala, and Pisgah) from common headquarters in Asheville, North Carolina. However, it does have a local ranger district office in Troy, North Carolina. There is one officially designated wilderness area within the forest‚Äîthe 5,025-acre (20.34 km¬≤) Birkhead Mountains Wilderness. The forest derives its name from the Uwharrie Mountains, the ancient mountains atop which most of the forest sits. The western border of the forest is made by the Yadkin River and Great Pee Dee River while the northern border follows the northernmost range of the Uwharries near Asheboro. To the east, the forest is bordered by the Montgomery County seat of Troy. The Forest lies within the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion and supports mixed forests of pine and oak. Land was first purchased by the Federal government in 1931, and the area was known as the Uwharrie Reservation. The Uwharrie Forest was given federal designation in the early 1960s by President John F. Kennedy, along with the Nantahala, Pisgah, and Croatan National Forests. The forest is bisected by several state and interstate highways. Both Interstate 73 and Interstate 74 run along the eastern boundary of the forest on the Moore County line from north to south. NC 73 runs from west to east from the Yadkin River to Mount Gilead. U.S. Highway 220 runs parallel to I-73/74. NC 109 runs from north to south from the Davidson County line to its end in Troy. NC 24/27 both run from the Yadkin River in the west to Moore County in the east. The forest is one of the key locations used in the US Army Special Warfare School's ROBIN SAGE exercise for the training of Special Forces students. The first substantial gold strike in the United States was discovered near this area in 1799, and gold was found in the Uwharrie Mountains in the 19th century. A mini gold rush occurred during the Great Depression. Panning for gold in the forest's streams and rivers remains a popular activity. Boating and fishing are available at Badin Lake, while the Uwharrie National Recreation Trail runs through the forest. Other trails and paths provide opportunities for hiking, mountain biking, camping, and horseback riding. Off-road vehicles have their own trail system, which is open seasonally. Uwharrie National Forest has received attention as of late for unconfirmed sightings of Mountain Lions within forest boundaries.

The CSIEHS school relocated to its new, permanent campus on Mitchell Road early in 2019.Home Central Sydney Intensive English High School Students Students attending the school can come from as many as 100 different countries, bringing with them a great diversity of languages, customs and beliefs. Students are all newly arrived, non-English speaking background students of high school age. They study at the school for between 15 and 50 weeks at the school at which point most students transfer to other government high schools in order to complete their studies in the School Certificate or Higher School Certificate. Some students will choose to begin other courses of study at other institutions, such as Technical and Further Education TAFE, and some may go directly to the workplace. The demographic mix of students is constantly shifting with national and international events, and geopolitics. The student body has been known to include migrants and/or refugees from China, Indonesia, South Korea, South America, Iraq, Sri Lanka, and Sudan. Staff The staff consists of a principal, deputy principal, head teachers, classroom teachers, specialist migrant counsellors, and school assistant support staff (administration and bi-lingual). All teachers are trained in at least two methodologies with one being English as a Second Language (ESL). Many of the teachers are also bi-lingual. Curriculum Departments The curriculum at CSIEHS is based on the Intensive English Program Curriculum Framework, a document which describes an appropriate progression of English language acquisition and the language outcomes essential for students in an intensive English program. The English as a Second Language (ESL) program at this school is taught through the Key Learning Areas (KLAs) to assist students in preparation for their completion of the School Certificate and/or Higher School Certificate.

In 1851, some land was reserved in the \\"Cleveland Paddocks\\" for a school to be established. 1856 In 1856, \\"temporary\\" pre-fabricated galvanised iron buildings were imported from Liverpool, England and erected on the Cleveland Street site. In its first year the school had an enrolment of 215 students. During this time Cleveland Street became one of the four \\"Model Schools\\", which included Fort Street, William Street (now closed), and Paddington. 1867 External picture of Cleveland Street Public School, ca. 1880‚Äì1890. Following the 1866 Public Schools Act, the pre-fabricated galvanised iron buildings at Cleveland Street were demolished to be replaced by substantial buildings. These took 14 months to construct and have been described as Gothic Revival in architecture. 1891 An additional wing was added to the school in what has been described as \\"Moderated Romanesque Style\\". It was at this time that the City Council granted the school its own access to and use of Prince Alfred Park as a playground. 1909 Internal picture of the Infants class at Cleveland Street Public School, ca. 1909. Due to new ideas in education such as manual training and the teaching of science, the school received another building addition with specialist rooms called \\"shops\\". 1913 The school became an Intermediate High School for boys and girls. 1924 Another building was erected on the site, this time a three-storey building said to resemble an \\"egg-crate\\". It added a further eight new classrooms to the boys department. 1956 Cleveland Street Boys High Becomes an all boy's high school. 1968 A \\"modern\\" building was constructed on the grounds, consisting of three levels and containing specialist rooms. 1980 The high school moved to new grounds and new buildings in the adjacent suburb of Alexandria. The site at Cleveland Street became an annex to the new high school, but with a separate function, that of providing intensive English language tuition for newly arrived migrant students. 2001 The site at Cleveland Street becomes a dedicated high school for intensive English tuition and is named \\"Cleveland Street Intensive English High School\\".

Athletics Beaufort High competes at the Class AAAA level in the South Carolina High School League. The school fields teams for boys in baseball, football, wrestling, basketball, swimming, cross country, track & field, tennis, and golf; and for girls in cheerleading, volleyball, basketball, swimming, cross country, track & field, tennis, softball and golf. Beaufort's rival is cross-town Battery Creek High School, but due to the relegation of Battery Creek to Class AAA (as a result of declining enrollment and the opening of Whale Branch High School), the schools do not play each other at the same frequency as before. With Bluffton High School having moved to Class AAAA, it is anticipated that the proximity of the schools will help foster a future rivalry.

Career Education and early career Pickett was born at Castle Air Force Base in Merced, California, and grew up in San Diego. He attended the University of California at San Diego where he was a Special Projects major, specializing in contemporary literary and film criticism and creative writing. He graduated summa cum laude, then moved to Los Angeles to attend the graduate program at USC School of Cinematic Arts. He dropped out in the early 1980s and, with his then-wife, Barbara Schock, wrote and directed two independent feature films, California Without End and From Hollywood to Deadwood. California Without End was sold to Bavarian Radio Television, a German television station, and From Hollywood to Deadwood to Island Pictures. Pickett returned to writing, landing a job as a writer on David Fincher‚Äôs first feature, Alien 3. In 1998 he wrote the screenplay for My Mother Dreams the Satan's Disciples in New York, which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short in 1999. Novels and Sideways In 1995, Pickett began writing novels. His first, a mystery titled La Purisima, didn't sell. His second was Sideways. Completed in 1999, the novel was submitted to both publishers and film production companies. After 18 rejection letters from publishers, Pickett‚Äôs agent pulled it from submission. Film production companies also passed. In late 1999, nearly a year after it had been written, one of the submissions by Pickett‚Äôs agent, Jess Taylor, at Endeavor, went to Alexander Payne‚Äôs agent, David Lonner at the same agency. Payne‚Äôs assistant, Brian Beery, read it then passed it to Payne who immediately optioned it. Shortly after Payne optioned Sideways it was greenlit by Artisan Entertainment. Emboldened by front page Daily Variety and Hollywood Reporter news about the Artisan greenlight, Pickett‚Äôs agent at Curtis Brown went back out to publishers in a mass submission, but it was again rejected. Eventually, Payne would put Sideways on hold and go off to make About Schmidt. In early 2003, Payne, fresh from the success of About Schmidt, returned his attention to Sideways. The project was greenlit by Fox Searchlight, who gained control of it from Artisan in July 2003 and a start date announced for late September. After over 100 rejection letters, Pickett‚Äôs new agent at Trident Media Group went back out with his still unpublished novel and ended up selling it in a fire sale to St. Martin‚Äôs Press for $5,000. It was published in June 2004, four months before the film was released. Sideways the film was released October 22, 2004. It went on to win over 350 awards from various critics and awards organizations, including 6 Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, 5 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, 5 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, 6 Indie Spirit Awards, 2 Golden Globes, et al. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. The film had an enormous impact on the world of wine, driving Pinot noir sales and decreasing Merlot, the grape variety the main character, Miles, expressed hatred for. In 2011, Pickett released a sequel to Sideways, titled Vertical. That same year it won the Gold Medal for Popular Fiction from the Independent Publisher Book Awards. In 2012 Pickett staged a play version of his novel Sideways at the Ruskin Group Theater in Santa Monica, California. It ran for six months and a production was later staged at the La Jolla Playhouse under the direction of Des McAnuff. Pickett spent a year traveling in Chile, New York, and Costa Rica before completing Sideways 3 Chile, set in the Chilean wine world. It was published in 2015. Stage and musical adaptions In 2019 it was announced that Sideways was scheduled to adapted for a Broadway musical. A play adapted by author Rex Pickett from the Sideways novel was produced at multiple theaters in the United States and the United Kingdom, including at the La Jolla Playhouse. In addition to the musical, it was reported that Rex Pickett had written screenplays based on his two Sideways sequels already in print, Vertical and Sideways 3 Chile.

Cunningham was born in Stewarton, Scotland. He studied at Glasgow College and the University of London. Cunningham moved to Toronto, Canada in 1868 where he began work as a journalist. Cunningham served as a correspondent, covering the Red River Rebellion for the Toronto Globe and Toronto Telegraph. Cunningham chose to stay in the new province and co-founded his own newspaper, The Manitoban. Cunningham and the newspaper were strong supporters of Liberal causes. He formed close relationships with M√©tis and francophone community leaders notably Joseph Dubuc and Louis Riel. Cunningham's political allies urged him to run for Parliament 1872 federal election. Cunningham was elected as a Liberal in the Marquette riding, defeating future Premier John Norquay. While in Parliament, Cunningham was a strong supporter of the M√©tis community. He supported a general amnesty for those involved in the Red River Rebellion as well as land reforms for M√©tis. Cunningham acted independently of his party in other matters as well. Prime Minister Macdonald noticed Cunningham's independent record and asked him to join the government caucus in 1873. Cunningham however stayed a Liberal and was re-elected in the following general election. Cunningham was appointed as a member of the interim executive of the North-West Territories but died in Minnesota, while en route to take up his new position. Following his death, Cunningham's opponent from the general election, Liberal Joseph Ryan, was declared to be the MP for the riding upon review. Ryan only narrowly defeated the deceased Cunningham in a subsequent by-election.

He was the creator, presenter and producer of Yorkshire Television‚Äôs religious programme Stars on Sunday. He was born in Tyldesley, Lancashire. His family moved to Llandudno when he was five. After leaving school, Yates worked as a cinema organist. He was born into a show business family; his mother booked stage acts. After the war he worked for BBC Television as a freelance designer and joined the BBC on the production side in 1949. He was involved with programmes such as Come Dancing, The Good Old Days and the Miss World competition. In later life, he lived near Conwy in North Wales. In 1968, he became Head of Children's programmes for Yorkshire Television. The following year, he began hosting Stars on Sunday. Yates introduced the show seated at an electric organ, placed in front of a stained- glass window. One of his many observations was, \\"We can't see round the bend in the road, but God can.\\" The programme attracted many special guests, including Harry Secombe, Dame Anna Neagle, and Gracie Fields. He was quoted as wanting stars to appear on the programme as that is what he thought would persuade viewers to tune in. From 1958 to 1975, Yates was married to actress and author Elaine Smith (whose stage name was Heller Toren, and who later wrote under the pseudonym Helene Thornton), and had a daughter Paula, born in 1959. His TV presenting career ended in 1974 when it was publicly revealed that he had been having an affair with young actress Anita Kay, although he was separated from his wife at the time. Amid the ensuing furor, Yates had to be smuggled from Yorkshire Television's studio complex in Leeds in the boot of a car. Jess Yates died in April 1993, aged 74. In December 1997, a DNA test revealed that Paula Yates' biological father was not Jess Yates, but the television presenter Hughie Green, a one time friend of Jess Yates who became his long-term arch enemy. Green was a key man in exposing Jess Yates's affair with Anita Kay back in 1974.

The Londons were near repeats of the preceding s, but with modified armour protection. The ship was laid down in December 1898, was launched in September 1899, and was completed in June 1902. Commissioned the same month, she served with the Mediterranean Fleet until early 1907. She was assigned to the Nore Division of the Home Fleet for nearly a year before transferring to the Channel Fleet. Rendered obsolete with the emergence of the new dreadnoughts in late 1906, she underwent an extensive refit in 1909, after which she served with the Atlantic Fleet. She was assigned to the Second Home Fleet in 1912 as part of the 5th Battle Squadron, and was temporarily fitted with a makeshift ramp for experiments with naval aircraft until 1913. Following the outbreak of World War I, the squadron was attached to the Channel Fleet before London was detached in March 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign, supporting ANZAC forces as they landed at Gaba Tepe and Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. She remained in the Mediterranean, supporting the Italian Royal Navy in the Adriatic Sea until October 1916. Returning to the United Kingdom, she was inactive until being converted to a minelayer in early 1918, which entailed the removal of her main armament. She served with the Grand Fleet's 1st Minelaying Squadron until the end of the war. Placed in reserve in 1919, she was eventually broken up for scrap in 1920. Design Line-drawing of the Formidable class; the Londons were identical in appearance. The five ships of the London class were ordered in 1898 in response to increased naval construction for the Russian Navy. The design for the London class was prepared in 1898; it was a virtual repeat of the preceding , though with significant revision to the forward armour protection scheme. Rather than a traditional transverse bulkhead for the forward end of the main belt armour, the belt was carried further forward and gradually tapered in thickness. Deck armour was also strengthened. London was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 714 officers and ratings. The Formidable-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The Formidable-class ships had a top speed of from . London had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading or elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to sixteen 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. The tubes were placed on the broadside, abreast of the main battery barbettes. London had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. Her main battery turrets sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history Painting of London in 1899 HMS London was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 8 December 1898, launched on 21 September 1899, and completed in June 1902. London commissioned at Portsmouth Dockyard on 7 June 1902 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet, with Captain James Goodrich in command. Before departure from home waters, she was scheduled to serve as flagship for the Coronation Review for King Edward VII at Spithead planned for 28 June 1902, but the King fell ill and the coronation and review was rescheduled for August 1902, without the London. She thus left Portsmouth in early July, stopping at Gibraltar, and arrived at Malta on 14 July. In September 1902 she visited the Aegean sea with other ships of the station for combined manoeuvres near Nauplia. While in the Mediterranean, she underwent refits at Malta in 1902‚Äì1903 and 1906. Starting in 1905, the ship began to have her 3-pounder guns gradually removed. In March 1907, London transferred to the Nore Division, Home Fleet, at the Nore, then to the Channel Fleet on 2 June 1908, serving as Flagship, Rear Admiral, Channel Fleet. She underwent a refit at Chatham Dockyard in 1908, which included the transfer of her last two 3-pounder guns from her foremast to her aft bridge and a flying bridge was installed aft. She was paid off there on 19 April 1909 to undergo another extensive refit, which saw the removal of the flying bridge. Her refit complete, London commissioned at Chatham on 8 February 1910 to serve as Second Flagship, Rear Admiral, Atlantic Fleet. Later that year, she had the last two of her 3-pounder guns removed. Under the fleet reorganisation of 1 May 1912, she became part of the Second Home Fleet at the Nore, reduced to a nucleus crew and assigned to the 3rd Battle Squadron. She collided with the merchant steamer SS Don Benite on 11 May 1912. She transferred to the 5th Battle Squadron and was used in experiments with flying off aircraft from May 1912 until 1913, employing a ramp built over her forecastle which had been transferred from the battleship Hibernia. During these experiments, Commander Charles Rumney Samson‚Äîwho had made the worlds first takeoff from a moving ship in May 1912 from Hibernia using a Short Improved S.27 biplane and the same ramp‚Äîrepeated his feat by taking off in the same aeroplane from London on 4 July 1912 while London was underway. In 1913, London had her anti-torpedo nets removed. World War I Illustration of London firing a broadside Upon the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was assigned to the Channel Fleet and based at Portland. Their first task was to escort the British Expeditionary Force across the English Channel. A number of experimental paint schemes were tried during the first month of the war but these were quickly abandoned in favour of battleship grey. It was briefly planned to deploy the squadron to replace the ships lost during the Action of 22 September 1914 but the orders to transfer to the Medway were rescinded. The squadron transferred to Sheerness on 14 November 1914 to guard against a possible German invasion. While there, London was present when the battleship exploded. Londons crew joined in the attempts to rescue survivors. The enquiry into the explosion was carried out aboard London. The squadron returned to Portland on 30 December 1914. In January 1915, the British and French navies began to draw ships to the eastern Mediterranean to begin operations against the Ottoman Empire, including several ships from the 5th Battle Squadron. By the end of the month, only London, the battleships , , and , and the light cruisers and were at Portland. In March 1915, as the British and French fleets waging the Dardanelles campaign were preparing to launch a major attack on 18 March, the overall commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, requested two more battleships of the 5th Squadron, Implacable and Queen, to be transferred to his command in the expectation of losses in the coming operation. By the time they arrived, the British had lost two battleships in the 18 March attack, prompting the Admiralty to finally disband 5th Squadron and send London and Prince of Wales to join the fleet. Before they departed, they were modified slightly for operations off the Dardanelles, including the installation of a pair of 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns on their quarterdecks and the re- installation of anti-torpedo nets. Gallipoli, 24 April 1915 London arrived at Lemnos on 23 March 1915, and over the next month, she took part in preparations of the British and French fleet for the landings at Cape Helles and at Anzac Cove, the beginning of the land portion of the Gallipoli Campaign. On her arrival in the eastern Mediterranean, London joined the 2nd Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Cecil Thursby. She supported the main landings at Gaba Tepe and Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. London arrived off the landing beach at about midnight, along with Queen and Prince of Wales; they were tasked with supporting the landing of the 3rd Australian Brigade. London covered the left side of the beach. Over the course of the landing, London and the other covering ships provided covering fire as the ANZAC troops advanced inland and helped to suppress Ottoman artillery. London, along with battleships Implacable, Queen, and Prince of Wales, was transferred to the 2nd Detached Squadron, organised to reinforce the Italian Navy in the Adriatic Sea when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. She was based at Taranto, Italy, and underwent a refit at Gibraltar in October 1915 during her Adriatic service. In October 1916, London returned to the United Kingdom, paid off at Devonport Dockyard to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels, and was laid up. While inactive, she underwent a refit in 1916‚Äì1917. The work included removing her main deck 6-inch guns and the upper deck 12-pounder guns and moving four of the 6-inch weapons to the upper deck battery where the 12-pounder guns had been located. In February 1918, London moved to Rosyth and began conversion to a minelayer. The conversion included removal of all four of her 12-inch (305-mm) guns and her anti-torpedo nets, replacement of her after main-battery turret with a 6-inch gun, and installation of minelaying equipment on her quarterdeck, including rails for 240 mines, and of a canvas screen to conceal the entire quarterdeck from external view. She also received an experimental dazzle camouflage paint scheme. The conversion was completed in April 1918, and on 18 May 1918 London recommissioned at Rosyth for service in the Grand Fleet's 1st Minelaying Squadron. Before the war ended on 11 November 1918, London had laid 2,640 mines in the Northern Mine Barrage. Postwar In January 1919, London was reduced to reserve at Devonport as a depot ship and repainted gray. As part of a post-war fleet organisation, she was assigned to the 3rd Fleet there. London was placed on the disposal list at Devonport in January 1920, and on the sale list on 31 March 1920. She was sold for scrapping to Stanlee Shipbreaking Company on 4 June 1920. She was resold to Slough Trading Company, then again resold to a German firm. She was towed to Germany for scrapping in April 1922.

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells motor vehicles. United Kingdom BL (formerly British Leyland Limited) was renamed to Rover Group.https://www.aronline.co.uk/facts-and-figures/history/bmc-bl- rover-timeline-1952-2005/ The Rover Group's Leyland Trucks division (which included its Freight Rover van business) was merged with the Dutch DAF Trucks company to form the new commercial vehicle company DAF NV. The new company's trucks (built in Leyland, Lancashire, England and Eindhoven, Netherlands) and its vans built in Birmingham, England, were branded as Leyland DAF for the UK market and as DAF for other European and worldwide markets. The Rover SD1 ceased production after 10 years and was replaced with the Rover 800, which was the third product of the venture with Honda. The Japanese version of this Rover model was the Honda Legend although SD1 sales continues into 1987 and was still popular with the British police force. Ford gave the Escort major design changes in March, becoming the MK4. The same changes were made to the Orion saloon range, which had a range mirroring the Escort with L and LX models, having originally been sold in GL and Ghia trim only. Ford also ends production of the long-running Capri coupe in December with sales continuing into the following year. Vauxhall replaced the Carlton with an all-new model after eight years in November but with a rear-wheel drive chassis providing the underpinnings for a four-door saloon and five-door estate aimed directly at the Ford Granada. Engines ranged from a 1.8 to a 3.0 V6 which produced almost 200 bhp. It was European Car of the Year for the 1987 model year. In January, Vauxhall launches a saloon based on the Astra called the Belmont to rival the forthcoming Ford Orion MK2 facelift in March. Germany Audi launched a new 80 range to compete with the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz 190E. The aerodynamic range of four-door saloons were the first cars in their sector to feature a zinc-coated body, aimed at improving resistance to corrosion and rust. The Audi corrosion warranty was also increased from 10 years to 12 years. The engines ranged from a 1.6 75 bhp unit to a 2.0 113 bhp fuel injected model. Five-cylinder versions of the car, with a modified interior, were sold as the Audi 90. BMW launched a new 7 Series to replace the nine-year-old original version. The 750iL (long-wheelbase) version doubled the cost with higher standards of specification. France The 1986 model year saw Renault launch the R21 range, a four-door family saloon competing with the Ford Sierra, Vauxhall Cavalier, Austin Montego and Citro√´n BX. There was also an American-built version called the Eagle Medallion, with 1.7 and 2.0 petrol engines as well as a 2.0 diesel. There was also a seven-seat estate car version of the R21 - badged Savanna in the UK and Nevada in France, priced slightly higher than the saloon. In November the Renault group's president Georges Besse was shot dead outside his mansion in Paris by members of militant anarchist organization Action Directe. Peugeot phased out the Talbot marque on passenger cars, though it was retained for PSA's light commercial vehicle - the Talbot Express. The phasing-out of Talbot began in October 1985 when the Horizon was replaced by the Peugeot 309 - which became the first \\"French\\" car to be built in Britain, at the Ryton plant near Coventry. The new model fit between Peugeot's 205 and 505 ranges, and was a direct competitor for the Ford Escort. Most of its power units, and its chassis, were derived from the Horizon. The Minx and Rapier ranges (previously Alpine and Solara) and the Samba were all withdrawn from production. This ended Talbot production in the UK, and by the end of 1986 only the Horizon assembly lines in Finland and Spain retained the marque on passenger cars. They too were terminated in 1987. The Ryton plant hosted production of a new Peugeot-badged car, which was due to be ready for the 1988 model year. The Citro√´n GSA ceased production after 16 years, having been effectively replaced by the larger BX four years ago. In October 1986, the launch took place of a new supermini, the AX, based around the running gear of the Peugeot 205. This was also due to spawn a Talbot badged model until Peugeot decided to discontinue the Talbot marque on passenger cars which meant it only launched as a Citroen. It would replace the LNA as well as the Talbot Samba while a 5-door model due the following year would replace the Visa. A CX replacement was planned for sale before the end of the 1980s. Italy The \\"Type Four\\" platform's third car was the Fiat Croma, which went into production early 1986. It was a large five-door hatchback similar in size to the Ford Granada, and its underpinnings had been around for the year beneath the Saab 9000 and Lancia Thema. The final car on this platform - an Alfa Romeo model - was planned for sale the following year. To celebrate its 75th anniversary, Alfa Romeo launched a 75 range to compete with the likes of the BMW 3 Series. Spain A year after the launch of the Ibiza hatchback, the saloon version of the car went on sale. Badged the M√°laga, it was similar in size to the Ford Orion and Volkswagen Jetta. Holland Volvo expanded its range with a coupe, the 480. It was a three- door coupe with a 2+2 seating arrangement, and was designed with American buyers in mind. The car had not been imported to the United States, but it had been imported to Britain. It was Volvo's first front-wheel drive car. Power comes from a 1.7 petrol engine which was also used by Renault and Peugeot. An integral computer was built into the car to control its electrical system. Japan Nissan launched a new version of its Sunny family car. The new model is available as a hatchback, estate, saloon or coupe. It had already been on sale for a year in its homeland, and was planned for sale in mainland Europe the following year as the Pulsar. Nissan opened its first European production plant in the Summer in Sunderland in the UK beginning with the Ford Sierra rivalling Bluebird range until 1990 when it was succeeded by the Primera.

He currently serves as chairman of the Institute of Ecotechnics, an international project development and management company. A fellow of the Linnean Society, the Royal Geographical Society, and the Explorer's Club, Allen has led multiple ecological expeditions, with a focus on the ecology of early civilizations, in Nigeria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tibet, Turkey, India, and the Altiplano. He has been called a \\"swashbuckling frontiersman\\" and an \\"eccentric mix of scientist, artist, entrepreneur, and adventurer\\" by author David Jay Brown in the book Voices from the Edge (1995).Brown, David Jay; Novick, Rebecca McClean. Voices from the Edge. The Crossroads Press. 1995. p. 179. Education Allen graduated from Pauls Valley High School in Carnegie, Oklahoma, in 1946, where he served as editor of the school newspaper and was named valedictorian of his class. From 1946 to 1952 he studied anthropology and history at Northwestern and Oklahoma universities, writing at Stanford University, and served as a machinist in the US Army Corps of Engineers. He earned a metallurgical-mining engineer degree with honors from the Colorado School of Mines in 1957, where he was president of the student body and received the American Gentleman Award; a master's degree with distinction in business administration from Harvard Business School in 1962, where he was a Baker Scholar; and a Certificate in Advanced Physiological Systems for Engineers from the University of Michigan in 1971. Political activism In 1951, Allen worked as a factory worker in a meat-packing plant in Chicago, becoming involved in various efforts of community and political activism, serving as the secretary of the Anti-Discrimination Committee for the UPWA-CIO District 10 (which represented 20,000 workers), and helping to organize and lead a march to free Willie McGee, whose conviction and death sentence for rape became a cause c√©l√®bre in the burgeoning civil rights movement. While organizing for the Meat Packers Union on the South Side of Chicago, Allen worked alongside acclaimed bass-baritone and actor Paul Robeson and sociologist and leading civil rights activist W.E.B. DuBois. Metallurgy After spending the summer of 1956 conducting research on nickel ores for the Battelle Institute, Allen became a senior metallurgist for the Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation, where he headed a metals team that developed over thirty alloys to product status. He then became assistant to the vice- president for David Lilienthal's Development and Resources Corporation, conducting regional projects in Iran, Liberia, and the Ivory Coast, where he became proficient in complex regional development. Travels In 1963, Allen self-financed a two-year sojourn around the globe by land and sea to study the origins of indigenous cultures and their various approaches to living within their ecosystems. His journeys took him to Africa, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, India, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, Japan, and the Philippines. He mixed with Berbers and the avant- garde literary coterie in Tangiers; set up a painting studio in Fez, Morocco; hitch-hiked across North Africa from Tangiers to the Pyramids and Karnak; lived with tribal chiefs in Sudan; traveled with refugees to the Rann of Kutch in India and Pakistan, consulted for the international medical relief organization Project Concern International in Vietnam; lived on a junk with Tankas (Hong Kong boat people); and worked as a journalistic stringer to a foreign correspondent on the Ho Chi Minh trail in South East Asia (visiting twenty-three South Vietnamese provinces in a six-month period).Allen, John. Me and the Biospheres. Synergetic Press. 2009. p 15.John Polk Allen https://ecotechnics.edu/staff/john-polk-allen/John Allen Bio https://www.synergeticpress.com/john-allen-bio/ Allen's world travels led to his creating a synergistic approach to both science and art. Regarding the confluence of cultures he experienced in Tangiers, he said: \\"There was the avant-garde art culture with William Burroughs and the people around him, and then the Berber culture which is maybe 6,000 years old and has its roots in the ancient magical traditions, and also the imperial culture of the Spanish, French and British empires. So the combination of the Western imperial culture, the native Berber culture, and the Western avant-garde forced a personal transformation of all values, not just on a mental and emotional level, but on a physiological and social level as well.\\"Brown, David Jay; Novick, Rebecca McClean. Voices from the Edge. The Crossroads Press. 1995. p. 181. Theatrical and literary career In 1967, Allen co-founded Theater of All Possibilities (TAP) in San Francisco with Kathelin Gray and Marie Harding, a theater company and artistic practice network that toured domestically and internationally from 1968 to 1989. The wandering troupe contributed to multiple agricultural, ecological, and cultural projects, including performances in the Australian Outback, Peruvian Amazon, and the sacred forest in Osogbo, Nigeria. Allen served as co-producer and dramaturge for TAP, founding ten studios while working with collaborators from the sciences, technology, history, and ecology. After the network was formally disbanded in 2010, Allen and Gray created the performance research initiative Theatre for the Reconstitution of Reality (THEATRRR). Allen began writing poetry, novels, short stories, plays, and autobiographical fiction in earnest in the mid-60s, many of which appeared under the pen name Johnny Dolphin. Highly influenced by the Beat Generation poets and writers of the 1950s and 60s, Allen became a practitioner of the \\"Tangier School\\" writing style, a literary movement identified with the fiction of Paul Bowles, Jack Kerouac, and William Burroughs, and the \\"cut-up\\" techniques of Burroughs and Brion Gysin. Allen's books include the science-fiction novel Far Out and Far Away: A Novel of Emergent Evolution; poetry collections The Dream and Drink of Freedom, Off the Road, and Wild: Poems, Aphorisms and Short Stories; the short-story collection My Many Kisses; and a trilogy of autobiographical novels: 39 Blows on a Gone Trumpet, Journey Around an Extraordinary Planet, and Liberated Space. His plays have been performed on seven continents, and he has read his work in Paris at George Whitman's Shakespeare and Company, in New York City accompanied by Ornette Coleman, in London with West African musicians at the October Gallery, and in Fort Worth, Texas with the Caravan of Dreams. Allen's autobiography, Me and the Biospheres (Synergetic Press, 2009), which provides a detailed description of the inspiration and experience that informed Biosphere 2, won the Benjamin Franklin Award for best autobiography/memoir of 2010.2010 Benjamin Franklin Award Winners and Finalists http://articles.ibpa- online.org/benefits/benjamin-franklin-awards/2010bfa/ Allen was called \\"Borges with a sense of humor!\\" by Maria Golia of the Cairo Times.Dolphin, Johnny. My Many Kisses and Other Short Stories. Synergetic Press. 2000 https://www.synergeticpress.com/shop/my-many-kisses/ Synergia ranch In 1969, Allen co-founded and became general manager of Synergia Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The ranch was home to the TAP network from 1969-1980, and again from 2000 to 2010. Situated on 130 acres of high altitude grassland, Synergia leased space to architectural enterprises, conducted anti- desertification work, developed special ecologically sustainable agricultural systems, and performed research in solar and wind energy. Over a thousand trees were planted, including 450 fruit trees and organic vegetable gardens. An extensive soil-building program was established, adobe buildings and a geodesic dome designed by Buckminster FullerAllen, John. Me and the Biospheres. Synergetic Press. 2009. p. 41. were constructed, and subsequent artisan enterprises included pottery, wood, iron, clothing, and leather work. In conjunction with a local construction firm, Synergia built over three dozen adobe buildings in Santa Fe, contributing to a local renaissance of traditional adobe architecture. In 2016, Synergia won the Good Earth award at the New Mexico Organic Agriculture conference in recognition of its land care.Alexis (February 23, 2017). \\"Synergia Ranch Good Earth Award\\". Santa Fe Farmers Market Institute. Retrieved 2 January 2018. Institute of Ecotechnics In 1973, Allen co-founded and became director of the Institute of Ecotechnics (IE), an educational, training, and research charity dedicated to the synergetic applications of technology and ecology, the environment, conservation, and heritage. With its U.S. base at Synergia Ranch in Santa Fe and U.K. headquarters at October Gallery in central London (an art gallery founded by IE in 1979 dedicated to the promotion of trans-cultural avant-garde art and artists), IE has organized international conferences focusing on emerging research in biospherics and space exploration. Guest speakers have included architect and systems theorist Buckminster Fuller and adventurer and ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. In the early 1970s, in collaboration with TAP, IE constructed the ecological research vessel Heraclitus in Oakland, California, using a Chinese junk model. In 1978 the ship signed a cooperative agreement with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration to collect weather, wind, cloud, temperature, and rainfall data during its voyages. Heraclitus has since logged over 250,000 nautical miles and undertaken twelve expeditions, including a three-year round-the-world voyage and journey through the tropics exploring the origins of human culture. It has sailed up the Amazon conducting ethno-botanical collections, undertaken oral history documentation in the Mediterranean Sea, and circumnavigated South America with an expedition to Antarctica to study the humpback whale population.Allen, John.

Dempster, Allen formed the corporation Space Biospheres Ventures (SBV) to invent, construct, and manage Biosphere 2. Project funding came primarily from the joint venture's financial partner Edward Bass‚Äôs Decisions Investment. The $250,000,000 projectBusiness Insider https://www.businessinsider.com/biosphere-two-pictures-tour-2018-4 would conduct scientific, technical, and management research relevant to understanding the biosphere of the Earth, and as a prototype for permanent life habitats on suitable locations in space. Allen was inventor, engineer, and executive chairman of Biosphere 2, which was designed to achieve a complex life-support system through the integration of seven areas or \\"biomes\\" ‚Äî rainforest, savannah, desert, marsh, ocean, intensive agriculture, and human habitat. Unique bio-regenerative technologies, such as soil bed reactors for air purification, aquatic waste processing systems, real-time analytic systems, and complex computer monitoring and control systems were developed to create an experimental prototype and test-bed for the stable, permanent life systems needed for space colonization. Between the years 1987-1991, SBV constructed the 7 million cubic foot (3.14 acres) Biosphere 2 in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains in Oracle, Arizona, in the appropriately Mars- like Sonoran Desert. Allen began the first manned Biosphere Test Module experiment in September 1988, residing in the structure for three days, proving that closed ecological systems could work with humans inside and setting a world record at that time.John Allen: Bio http://www.biospherics.org/biosphere2/key-people/john-p-allen-4/ The first crew (four men and four women) sealed themselves inside Biosphere 2 on September 26, 1991, and began a two-year experiment to study how the ecosystems inside the artificial biosphere developed. As Allen described in a scientific paper published with Mark Nelson in 1997, \\"The main objective of the experiment was to determine if an artificial biosphere could operate, increasing storages of energy and biomass, preserving a high level of biodiversity and biomes, stabilizing its waters, soils and atmosphere, increasing information and providing a healthy and creative life for humans working as naturalists, ecosystem scientists, and technicians.\\"Biospherics and Biosphere 2, Mission One (1991-1993). https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292000668_Biospherics_and_Biosphere_2_Mission_One_1991-1993 Biosphere 2 captivated the world's attention and imagination; Discover magazine asserted that Biosphere 2 was \\"the most exciting scientific project to be undertaken in the U.S. since President John F. Kennedy launched us toward the moon,\\"Discover. May, 1987. and talk-show host Phil Donahue, in a live on-site broadcast, called Biosphere 2 \\"one of the most ambitious man-made projects ever.\\"Biosphere's image: rise, fall, and rehabilitation http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-1.3/metasphere.html Criticism Biosphere 2 also generated controversy, stemming from a combination of cost overruns, operational challenges, group infighting, and a suspicion, amplified by the media, that Allen's vision for the project centered on how humans could survive the destruction of the planet in the event of nuclear holocaust. In 1991, the New York Times referenced Allen's quote from a 1985 publication, The Biosphere Catalogue (Synergetic Press, 1985), where he discussed how \\"higher forms of life\\" could survive the destruction of civilization in biospheres: \\"A hundred Refugia protected by their own energy resources in mountain caverns could release full-scale life after the skies begin to clear.\\"Broad, William J. \\"As Biosphere is Sealed, Its Patrons Reflect on Life.\\" New York Times. Sept. 24, 1991. The ensuing media scrutiny cast doubt on Allen's goals and methods, and under increasing pressure he resigned as Executive Chairman. Commenting on his change of status, he said: \\"I feel that this was an unnecessary tragedy and I offer the hand of friendship to Ed Bass to reverse the ongoing calamity and put Biosphere 2 on sound footing for the future of humanity and science.\\"Bautman, Adam S. \\"Creator of Biosphere 2 Quits Project.\\" Los Angeles Times. September 9, 1994. Speaking on his treatment by the media, Allen clarified, \\"I said the Biosphere was a \\"Refugia.\\" This word has a technical meaning in biology, it means a place that has a concentration of life diversity... this became, in certain sensationalist hands, interpreted as me being the head of an apocalyptic cult... You can't live in Biosphere 2 if Biosphere 1 were destroyed‚Äîat least on earth. It was a dumb smear job.\\"Brown, David Jay; Novick, Rebecca McClean. Voices from the Edge. The Crossroads Press. 1995. p. 200. In June 1994, Allen and the board of SBV dissolved their partnership and transformed the joint venture into a corporation with Ed Bass as the majority owner of Biosphere 2. Allen and the SBV team then formed two new companies, Biospheres, LLC, to design and build the next generation of artificial biospheres, and EcoFrontiers LLC, to carry out projects in rainforest, savannah, sustainable agriculture, and urban biomes related to Earth biosphere problems. These two companies ultimately merged to form Global Ecotechnics Corporation (GCE), an international project development firm owning and managing sustainable ecological research projects, including: Las Casas de la Selva in Puerto Rico; Les Marroniers Conference Center and Provencal farm in Aix-en-Provence, France; Silver Hills Properties in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Lundonia House in London, England, and Birdwood Downs in West Kimberley, Australia. Since its inception, Allen has served as Chairman of GEC. Despite the criticism that led to Allen‚Äôs ouster, Biosphere 2 and its initial two-year experiment remains a significant scientific accomplishment, proving the viability of humans living in a man-made, fully recycling ecological system. A wealth of scientific results are available on the findings of the project, including a compendium of research papers published in the journal Ecological Engineering and reprinted in the book Biosphere 2 Research Past and Present.Marino, B.D.V.; Odum, Howard T. \\"Biosphere 2: Research Past and Present\\" Elsevier Science. 1999. The New Yorker asserted, \\"Much of what is known about coral reefs and ocean acidification was originally discovered, improbably enough in Arizona, in the self-enclosed, supposedly self-sufficient world known as Biosphere 2.\\"The New Yorker. November 20, 2006. The Discovery Channel rated Biosphere 2 \\"third in top ten greatest engineering achievements of the twentieth century.\\"Allen, John. Me and the Biospheres. Synergetic Press. 2009. p. 179. Influences Allen's work is influenced by the philosophy of geochemist and mineralogist Vladimir Vernadsky, most noted for his book The Biosphere (1926), and Buckminster Fuller, whose theories on whole-systems inter-relatedness was popularized by his two-volume work Synergetics: Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking (1975) and Synergetics 2: Further Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking (1979).Ecosystems for Today‚Äôs Architectures. https://ecotechnics.edu/2014/01/antonio-saggio-green-bodies-give-ampoule-will- live/Allen, John. Me and the Biospheres. Synergetic Press. 2009. pp. 40, 41, 119. He described Fuller's influence in an interview with the Italian contemporary art magazine Mousse: \\"Bucky was a science philosopher and I was an engineering philosopher, so I took it as an engineering problem. An act of putting together a beaucoup d‚Äôargent and a beaucoup d‚Äôintelligentsia. Or in other words, synergies. Bucky‚Äôs the one who came up with and really developed the concept of synergy. But I had also developed that, independently, being a metallurgical engineer.\\"Mousse. No. 57. February‚ÄìMarch 2017. Philosophy Allen has spoken at a variety of international forums on the emerging science of biospherics; the implications of Biosphere 2 for health, environment, science, and culture; the key role of space biospheres to create data needed to understand Earth's biosphere; and on the necessity for humans to create harmony between ecological systems, world markets, and military technics. He has written or collaborated on over forty scientific publications, papers and presentations, many on biospheric and ecotechnic science and applications of systems ecology that informed Biosphere 2. Notable papers include \\"Ethnospherics: Origin of Human Cultures, Their Subjugation by the Technosphere, The Beginning of an Ethnosphere, and Steps Needed to Complete the Ethnosphere\\" (2003), which proposes the need for a cybersphere that gives immediate feedback on technological impacts to the biosphere;Ethnospherics: Origins of human cultures, their subjugation by the technosphere, the beginning of an ethnosphere, and steps needed to complete the ethnosphere http://www.esep.de/articles/esep/2003/E29.pdf and \\"The Evolution of Humanity: Past, Present, and Possible Future\\" (2000),\\"The Evolution of Humanity: Past, Present, and Possible Future.\\" The Duversity Newsletter. No. 4. 2000. which posits that humanity requires a stand-alone taxonomic classification, separate from the primate order of the animal kingdom. In 1996, Allen delivered a speech at Buckminster Fuller's memorial where he offered insight into the exploratory spirit and synergistic philosophy the two men shared: \\"I think adventure is where human beings can find the best route to the answer of the question, \\"Who am I?\\" You don't have to justify climbing Mount Everest, you don't have to justify diving deeper into the oceans than anyone before, and you don't have to justify going into space. It's an end in itself because it leads to contemplation... It takes you out of superstition and fanaticism. That may be its greatest benefit.\\"Buckminster Fuller‚Äôs Synergetic Algorithm and Challenges of the Twenty-First Century http://www.biospherics.org/publications/1984-2003/buckminster-fullers- synergetic-algorithm-and-challenges-of-the-twenty-first-century/ See also * Biosphere 2 * Caravan of Dreams * Institute of Ecotechnics * Theater of All Possibilities * Synergia Ranch * October Gallery References  External links  * Biospherics.org * Architecture and Vision News * John Allen (pen name Johnny Dolphin) author page on Synergetic Press * Antonino Saggio, Ecosystems for Today‚Äôs Architectures.

The term is also loosely used to refer to Bedspace apartments. Yih-jong (Áæ©Ëéä) literally means \\"mansion of righteousness\\" and originally referred to any charitable organization. These charities were typically established by prominent families to promote their standing in the community. The designation yih-jong was first used by Fan's Yih-Jong (ËåÉÊ∞èÁæ©Ëéä), established by Song Dynasty imperial chancellor Fan Zhongyan in his hometown Suzhou. Emulating Fan's model, many prominent families founded yih-jongs between the Song and Qing dynasties to support their clansmen and local communities, offering charitable services such as orphanages, free schools, disaster relief, and mortuaries. The name yih-jong eventually became a euphemism for \\"coffin home\\" or \\"morgue\\" by the late 19th century. This is because they were the de facto undertakers of dead people whose next of kin could not be found or were too poor to afford funeral services, and provided temporary storage and transport of the coffins and bodies of emigrants who desired burial in their place of origin. The establishment of Tung Wah Coffin Home in Hong Kong in 1875, named \\"Tung Wah Yih Jong\\" (Êù±ËèØÁæ©Ëéä) in Cantonese Chinese, firmly entrenched this euphemistic use. Coffin homes are primarily found in Greater China and places with substantial overseas Chinese populations. Most coffins that pass through the care of a coffin home are those of migrant workers who die in their place of work but who desired burial in their home villages. Coffin homes also provide temporary storage for deceased persons who are unable to afford a funeral or whose relatives cannot be located.

According to a map and materials by Heritage Advisory Committee and Environment and Waste Management Committee of the City of Burnaby (1993), the number of native campsites discovered on the shores of the Fraser River, Burrard Inlet and Deer Lake and some petroglyphs suggest that the area was used extensively by local aboriginal peoples such as the Squamish, Musqueam and Kwantlen for hunting and fishing before the arrival of European settlers. The earliest known European immigrant who settled on the banks of the Brunette River near the present-day North Road in 1860 was William Holmes. According to his daughter Charlotte, local native people gathered at their farm each season to catch and dry their winter supplies of salmon.

This is the first dictionary of colonial Australian, with slang, words introduced from Aboriginal languages and pidgin.Coleman, Julie, A History of Cant and Slang Dictionaries, vol.

Lentzner seems to have spent some years in New South Wales in the 1870s (he taught languages at Sydney Grammar and Kings School and mentions coming across \\"Yokohama-Pidgin\\" as spoken by Japanese naval officers in Sydney in 1877) which gives the Australian portions some claim to originality and importance; for the rest he relies heavily on other authorities. The Colonial English word-lists are heavily dependent on earlier lists, with over half of the entries copied from Albert Barr√®re and Charles Godfrey Leland; Robertson concluding that Lentzner's book \\"is in fact a work of synthesis and plagiarism.\\"Robertson, op. cit., p. 77; quoted in Coleman, p. 50. The claim to originality and importance may be arguable and the use of other authorities questionable - as The Bulletin, in a scathing notice of 30 January 1892, wrote: \\"published at the end of last year ... [and] almost instantly withdrawn. The latter step was the proper one ... as the material, badly compiled at best, violated several copyrights.\\" They went on: \\"The very faults of the work, however, will give it value in collectors' eyes, and those fortunate enough to get hold of one of the few copies which reached Australia may now be interested to know that the book is already selling at fancy prices.\\" Whether, or however, the difficulties of copyright were resolved the same sheets were re-issued with a cancel title page and a new title, Dictionary of the Slang-English of Australia, dated 1892.

In many applications it is the right tail of the distribution that is of interest, but a distribution may have a heavy left tail, or both tails may be heavy. There are three important subclasses of heavy-tailed distributions: the fat-tailed distributions, the long-tailed distributions and the subexponential distributions. In practice, all commonly used heavy-tailed distributions belong to the subexponential class. There is still some discrepancy over the use of the term heavy-tailed. There are two other definitions in use. Some authors use the term to refer to those distributions which do not have all their power moments finite; and some others to those distributions that do not have a finite variance. The definition given in this article is the most general in use, and includes all distributions encompassed by the alternative definitions, as well as those distributions such as log-normal that possess all their power moments, yet which are generally considered to be heavy-tailed. (Occasionally, heavy-tailed is used for any distribution that has heavier tails than the normal distribution.) Definitions Definition of heavy-tailed distribution The distribution of a random variable X with distribution function F is said to have a heavy (right) tail if the moment generating function of X, MX(t), is infinite for all t > 0.Rolski, Schmidli, Scmidt, Teugels, Stochastic Processes for Insurance and Finance, 1999 That means : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{t x} \\\\,dF(x) = \\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\mbox{for all } t>0. S. Foss, D. Korshunov, S. Zachary, An Introduction to Heavy-Tailed and Subexponential Distributions, Springer Science & Business Media, 21 May 2013 An implication of this is that : \\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} e^{t x}\\\\Pr[X>x] = \\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\mbox{for all } t>0.\\\\, This is also written in terms of the tail distribution function : \\\\overline{F}(x) \\\\equiv \\\\Pr[X>x] \\\\, as : \\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} e^{t x}\\\\overline{F}(x) = \\\\infty \\\\quad \\\\mbox{for all } t >0.\\\\, Definition of long-tailed distribution The distribution of a random variable X with distribution function F is said to have a long right tail if for all t > 0, : \\\\lim_{x \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\Pr[X>x+t\\\\mid X>x] =1, \\\\, or equivalently : \\\\overline{F}(x+t) \\\\sim \\\\overline{F}(x) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{as } x \\\\to \\\\infty. \\\\, This has the intuitive interpretation for a right-tailed long-tailed distributed quantity that if the long-tailed quantity exceeds some high level, the probability approaches 1 that it will exceed any other higher level. All long- tailed distributions are heavy-tailed, but the converse is false, and it is possible to construct heavy-tailed distributions that are not long-tailed. Subexponential distributions Subexponentiality is defined in terms of convolutions of probability distributions. For two independent, identically distributed random variables X_1,X_2 with common distribution function F the convolution of F with itself, F^{*2} is convolution square, using Lebesgue‚ÄìStieltjes integration, by: : \\\\Pr[X_1+X_2 \\\\leq x] = F^{*2}(x) = \\\\int_{0}^x F(x-y)\\\\,dF(y), and the n-fold convolution F^{*n} is defined inductively by the rule: : F^{*n}(x) = \\\\int_{0}^x F(x-y)\\\\,dF^{*n-1}(y). The tail distribution function \\\\overline{F} is defined as \\\\overline{F}(x) = 1-F(x). A distribution F on the positive half-line is subexponential if : \\\\overline{F^{*2}}(x) \\\\sim 2\\\\overline{F}(x) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{as } x \\\\to \\\\infty. This implies that, for any n \\\\geq 1, : \\\\overline{F^{*n}}(x) \\\\sim n\\\\overline{F}(x) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{as } x \\\\to \\\\infty. The probabilistic interpretation of this is that, for a sum of n independent random variables X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n with common distribution F, : \\\\Pr[X_1+ \\\\cdots +X_n>x] \\\\sim \\\\Pr[\\\\max(X_1, \\\\ldots,X_n)>x] \\\\quad \\\\text{as } x \\\\to \\\\infty. This is often known as the principle of the single big jump or catastrophe principle. A distribution F on the whole real line is subexponential if the distribution F I([0,\\\\infty)) is. Here I([0,\\\\infty)) is the indicator function of the positive half-line. Alternatively, a random variable X supported on the real line is subexponential if and only if X^+ = \\\\max(0,X) is subexponential. All subexponential distributions are long-tailed, but examples can be constructed of long-tailed distributions that are not subexponential. Common heavy- tailed distributions All commonly used heavy-tailed distributions are subexponential. Those that are one-tailed include: *the Pareto distribution; *the Log-normal distribution; *the L√©vy distribution; *the Weibull distribution with shape parameter greater than 0 but less than 1; *the Burr distribution; *the log-logistic distribution; *the log-gamma distribution; *the Fr√©chet distribution; *the log-Cauchy distribution, sometimes described as having a \\"super-heavy tail\\" because it exhibits logarithmic decay producing a heavier tail than the Pareto distribution. Those that are two-tailed include: *The Cauchy distribution, itself a special case of both the stable distribution and the t-distribution; *The family of stable distributions, excepting the special case of the normal distribution within that family. Some stable distributions are one-sided (or supported by a half-line), see e.g. L√©vy distribution. See also financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering. *The t-distribution. *The skew lognormal cascade distribution.  Relationship to fat-tailed distributions  A fat-tailed distribution is a distribution for which the probability density function, for large x, goes to zero as a power x^{-a}. Since such a power is always bounded below by the probability density function of an exponential distribution, fat- tailed distributions are always heavy-tailed. Some distributions, however, have a tail which goes to zero slower than an exponential function (meaning they are heavy-tailed), but faster than a power (meaning they are not fat- tailed). An example is the log-normal distribution . Many other heavy-tailed distributions such as the log-logistic and Pareto distribution are, however, also fat-tailed.  Estimating the tail-index  There are parametric (see Embrechts et al.) and non-parametric (see, e.g., Novak) approaches to the problem of the tail-index estimation. To estimate the tail-index using the parametric approach, some authors employ GEV distribution or Pareto distribution; they may apply the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE).  Pickand's tail-index estimator  With (X_n , n \\\\geq 1) a random sequence of independent and same density function F \\\\in D(H(\\\\xi)), the Maximum Attraction Domain of the generalized extreme value density H , where \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. If \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} k(n) = \\\\infty and \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{k(n)}{n}= 0, then the Pickands tail-index estimation is : \\\\xi^\\\\text{Pickands}_{(k(n),n)} =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln 2} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{X_{(n-k(n)+1,n)} - X_{(n-2k(n)+1,n)}}{X_{(n-2k(n)+1,n)} - X_{(n-4k(n)+1,n)}}\\\\right) where X_{(n-k(n)+1,n)}=\\\\max \\\\left(X_{n-k(n)+1},\\\\ldots ,X_{n}\\\\right). This estimator converges in probability to \\\\xi.  Hill's tail-index estimator  Let (X_t , t \\\\geq 1) be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with distribution function F \\\\in D(H(\\\\xi)), the maximum domain of attraction of the generalized extreme value distribution H , where \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. The sample path is {X_t: 1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq n} where n is the sample size. If \\\\\\\\{k(n)\\\\\\\\} is an intermediate order sequence, i.e. k(n) \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n-1\\\\\\\\}, , k(n) \\\\to \\\\infty and k(n)/n \\\\to 0, then the Hill tail- index estimator isHill B.M.

Estimation of heavy-tailed density Nonparametric approaches to estimate heavy- and superheavy-tailed probability density functions were given in Markovich. These are approaches based on variable bandwidth and long-tailed kernel estimators; on the preliminary data transform to a new random variable at finite or infinite intervals which is more convenient for the estimation and then inverse transform of the obtained density estimate; and \\"piecing-together approach\\" which provides a certain parametric model for the tail of the density and a non-parametric model to approximate the mode of the density. Nonparametric estimators require an appropriate selection of tuning (smoothing) parameters like a bandwidth of kernel estimators and the bin width of the histogram. The well known data- driven methods of such selection are a cross-validation and its modifications, methods based on the minimization of the mean squared error (MSE) and its asymptotic and their upper bounds. A discrepancy method which uses well-known nonparametric statistics like Kolmogorov-Smirnov's, von Mises and Anderson- Darling's ones as a metric in the space of distribution functions (dfs) and quantiles of the later statistics as a known uncertainty or a discrepancy value can be found in. Bootstrap is another tool to find smoothing parameters using approximations of unknown MSE by different schemes of re-samples selection, see e.g. See also *Leptokurtic distribution *Generalized extreme value distribution *Outlier *Long tail *Power law *Seven states of randomness *Fat-tailed distribution **Taleb distribution and Holy grail distribution References Category:Tails of probability distributions Category:Types of probability distributions Category:Actuarial science Category:Risk ","title":"Heavy-tailed distribution"},{"id":"8092208","text":"Altaria may refer to: *Altaria (Pok√©mon), a fictional species of Pok√©mon *Altaria (rail service), a Spanish rail line *Altaria (band), a Finnish musical group ","title":"Altaria"},{"id":"8092242","text":"An Inch of Gold for an Inch of Time is the 2005 release by American mathcore band The Number Twelve Looks Like You.

Biography Rubin studied with Richard Stoltzman and Kalmen Opperman, attended the California Institute of the Arts and received a BFA from the State University of New York at Purchase. Rubin holds a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from City University London for his pioneering work on improvisation and ornamentation in klezmer clarinet music. He is currently Assistant Professor and Director of Music Performance at the University of Virginia‚Äôs McIntire Department of Music, and has taught at Cornell, Syracuse University, Ithaca College, and Humboldt University in Berlin. In addition to appearances with traditional performers such as the Epstein Brothers, Moshe ‚ÄúMoussa‚Äù Berlin, Seymour Rexsite and Miriam Kressyn, Leon Schwartz, Sid Beckerman, Pete Sokolow, Danny Rubinstein, Ben Bazyler, and Leopold Kozlowski, he leads the international Joel Rubin Ensemble (also known as the Joel Rubin Jewish Music Ensemble, US/Hungary/Italy) and was the founder and clarinetist of some of the most internationally respected klezmer ensembles, including the pioneering revival group Brave Old World. The Joel Rubin Ensemble features K√°lm√°n Balogh on cimbalom, David Chernyavsky on violin, and Claudio Jacomucci on accordion. Rubin‚Äôs albums Midnight Prayer, Beregovski‚Äôs Khasene (Beregovski‚Äôs Wedding), Bessarabian Symphony, Zeydes un Eyniklekh (Grandfathers and Grandsons) and Hungry Hearts are considered to be masterpieces of classical Eastern European and American Jewish music. His music can be heard in several films, and the award-winning documentary portrait A Tickle in the Heart about the Epstein Brothers Orchestra is based on his research and screenplay. Rubin has collaborated with a number of artists as diverse as jazz composer-pianist Uri Caine, Israeli world musician, Yair Dalal, and Italian composer-clarinetist, Roberto Paci Dal√≤.

He played an important role not only in the Indian freedom movement but also the Karnataka Unification movement. Early life and education Nijalingappa was born on 10 December 1902 to a middle class family in Haluvagalu, a small village in Bellary, Karnataka (then in the Madras Presidency of British India). His father, a small businessman, died when Nijalingappa was five; his mother was a homemaker. The family were Lingayat Hindus; Nijalingappa's mother was noted as a devout worshipper of Shiva. Nijalingappa later recalled that his \\"father's ancestors were all rich profligates\\" and that they \\"dissipated their wealth on gambling, drinking and womanising.\\" He added that his \\"mother's father helped [his] parents, but [his family] were still very poor.\\" He grew up in Davanagere and, as a child, was given a traditional education by Veerappa Master, an elder teacher. He joined a formal, western primary school in Davanagere and then a secondary school in Chitradurga in 1919. He became interested in politics during this time after reading the political writings of Annie Besant. In 1924, he graduated in the Arts from the Central College, Bengaluru, and got his Law degree from the Law College, Pune in 1926. Thus, like many other leaders of the Indian freedom movement, he received a blend of both traditional Indian-style and Western- style education. He was influenced by the ideologies of Mahatma Gandhi and Rajendra Prasad, and began to take an active part in the freedom movement in his native Karnataka. Political career Nijalingappa attended the Congress sessions as a spectator. It was in 1936, when he came into contact with N. S. Hardikar, that he began to take an active interest in the organization. He served it first as a volunteer, rising to be the President of the Pradesh Congress Committee and finally the President of the All India Congress Committee in 1968. He became president of the Mysore Congress and was also a member of the historic Constituent Assembly from 1946 to 1950. In 1952, he was elected to the First Lok Sabha from the Chitaldrug constituency (now Chitradurga) then in Mysore state. In recognition of his enormous services towards the unification of Karnataka, he was chosen as the first Chief Minister of the unified state. Then again for the second time, he was elected to the same post and he continued in that post up to April 1968. He may well be called the \\"Maker of Modern Karnataka\\". The state owes much to him for development of agricultural, irrigation, industrial and transport projects. He became the Congress President when people in many parts of the country had expressed their distrust in it in the 1967 elections. He chaired two Congress sessions in 1968 and 1969 held in Hyderabad and Faridabad respectively. Due to his untiring efforts, the Congress Party was re-invigorated. However, the factional feud between various factions of the party increased and finally resulted in the historic split of the party in 1969. He was the last president of undivided Indian National Congress and had to see his party being split into Congress (R) that supported Indira Gandhi, and Congress (Organization) or Syndicate Congress that consisted of senior leaders like Nijalingappa himself, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, Kamaraj and Morarji Desai. After the Congress split, Nijalingappa gradually retired from politics. After giving up active politics, he served as chairman of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Society. He was widely revered even after his retirement and was known for his simplicity and integrity. He died on 9 August 2000 at his residence in Chitradurga at the age of 97. He is remembered fondly by the Tibetan community of India because as Chief Minister of Karnataka, he gave land to Tibetan refugees for the purpose of resettlement. Karnataka today has the largest Tibetan settlements and the largest population in exile. Bylakuppe, Mundgod, Kollegal and Gurupura (near Bylakuppe) are the four Tibetan settlements in Karnataka.

The Londons were near repeats of the preceding s, but with modified armour protection. Due to slight differences between Queen and and the other Londons, they are sometimes referred to as the Queen class. The ship's main battery consisted of four 12-inch (305-mm) guns, and she had top speed of . The ship was laid down in March 1901, was launched in March 1902, and was completed in March 1904. After commissioning in April 1904, she served with the Mediterranean Fleet until 1906, when she returned to Britain before embarking on another stint with the Mediterranean Fleet later that year. Queen was transferred back to the United Kingdom in 1908 and thereafter served in the Atlantic Fleet, the Home Fleet, and finally the 5th Battle Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1914. After the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Queen, still part of the 5th Battle Squadron, initially served in the English Channel. After operations with the Dover Patrol, she served in the Dardanelles Campaign in support of the Allied landings at Gallipoli. She participated in the Landing at Cape Helles on 25‚Äì26 April and supported ANZAC forces ashore over the course of the following month. In late May 1915, Queen was withdrawn to reinforce the Italian fleet at the southern end of the Adriatic Sea after Italy joined the war on the side of the Allies. In early 1917, she was converted into a depot ship to support the Otranto Barrage and was disarmed over the course of the year. The ship returned to Britain after the war in early 1919, where she was briefly used as a barracks ship. Queen was sold for scrap in 1920 and was broken up the following year. Design Line-drawing of the Formidable class; the Londons were identical in appearance The five ships of the London class were ordered in 1898 in response to increased naval construction for the Russian Navy. The design for the London class was prepared in 1898; it was a virtual repeat of the preceding , though with significant revision to the forward armour protection scheme. Rather than a traditional transverse bulkhead for the forward end of the main belt armour, the belt was carried further forward and gradually tapered in thickness. Deck armour was also strengthened. Due to slight differences between the last two members of the class‚ÄîQueen and ‚Äîand the rest of the London-class ships, these vessels are sometimes referred to as the Queen class. Queen was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 714 officers and ratings. The Formidable-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty water-tube boilers. Queen was the only member of the class to be fitted with Babcock & Wilcox boilers instead of the Belleville boilers installed in the other ships. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The Formidable-class ships had a top speed of from . Queen had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading or elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to fourteen 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. The tubes were placed on the broadside, abreast of the main battery barbettes. Queen had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on the aft end of the belt was thick. Her main battery turrets sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history Pre-World War I HMS Queen was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 12 March 1901. Lady Charles Scott (wife of Admiral Lord Charles Scott), Lady Ernestine Edgcumbe, Mrs. Jackson (wife of Rear-Admiral T. S. Jackson), and Mrs. Champness (wife of Chief Constructor of Devonport Dockyard H. B. Champness) took part in the ceremony. She was launched and named by Queen Alexandra on 8 March 1902, in the presence of King Edward VII. It was the first major public event attended by the couple since the end of the mourning period after Edward VII's accession the previous year. The ship was completed in March 1904. HMS Queen was commissioned on 7 April 1904 at Devonport Dockyard for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. She returned to the United Kingdom and paid off in April 1906, then recommissioned on 8 May 1906 to return to the Mediterranean. She refitted at Malta in 1906‚Äì1907 for duty as a flagship, and on 20 March 1907 became Fleet Flagship, Vice Admiral. Her second commission for Mediterranean Fleet service ended when she paid off at Devonport on 14 December 1908. On 15 December 1908, Queen recommissioned for service with the Atlantic Fleet. She collided with the Greek merchant steamer SS Dafni at Dover on 1 February 1909, suffering no serious damage, and underwent a refit at Devonport in 1910‚Äì1911. On 15 May 1912, Queen transferred to the Second Home Fleet. In April 1914 she became 2nd Flagship, Rear Admiral, in the 5th Battle Squadron, Second Fleet, and was assigned duties as a gunnery training ship at Portsmouth. World War I When World War I began in August 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was assigned to the Channel Fleet and based at Portland. Queen and her half-sister were attached temporarily to the Dover Patrol in late October 1914 to bombard German Army forces along the coast of Belgium in support of Allied forces fighting at the front. The German forces were attacking French positions to the east of Dunkirk, and they were in dire need of heavy artillery support. A flotilla of destroyers and monitors helped to break up the attack before Queen and Implacable arrived. Reports of an imminent German counterattack with armoured cruisers, which ultimately failed to materialize, led the British to send the battleships to guard against it in company with the Harwich Force. When it had become clear that the German fleet posed no threat, Queen and Implacable returned to the Channel Fleet. On 14 November 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was transferred to Sheerness in case of a possible German invasion attempt, but the squadron returned to Portland on 30 December 1914. In March 1915, as the British and French fleets waging the Dardanelles campaign were preparing to launch a major attack on 18 March, the overall commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, requested two more battleships of the 5th Squadron, Implacable and Queen, to be transferred to his command in the expectation of losses in the coming operation. The Admiralty ordered the two ships to transfer to the Dardanelles, and they left England on 13 March 1915 and arrived at Lemnos on 23 March 1915. By the time they arrived, the British had lost two battleships in the 18 March attack, prompting the Admiralty to send the last two ships of the 5th Squadron to join the fleet. On her arrival off the Dardanelles, Queen joined 2nd Squadron, where she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Cecil Thursby. Over the course of the next month, the British and French fleet began preparations for the Landing at Cape Helles, the beginning of the land portion of the Gallipoli Campaign. She supported the ANZAC landings at Gaba Tepe on 25 April 1915. Queen arrived off the landing beach at about midnight, along with the battleships and ; they were tasked with supporting the landing of the 3rd Australian Brigade. Queen covered the right side of the beach. Over the course of the landing, Queen and the other covering ships provided covering fire as the ANZAC troops advanced inland and helped to suppress Ottoman artillery. Queen, Implacable, London, and were transferred to the 2nd Detached Squadron, organised to reinforce the Italian Navy in the Adriatic Sea when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. She arrived at her new base, Taranto, Italy, on 27 May 1915. From December 1916 to February 1917, Queen was refitted for service as a depot ship for the personnel of the Otranto Barrage that attempted to block German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats from passing through the Strait of Otranto. Most of her crew returned to the United Kingdom, leaving only a care-and-maintenance crew behind, and she was gradually disarmed as her guns were allocated to other duties. Most of her guns had been removed by April 1917, and all of her guns had been put ashore by October 1917, where they were turned over to the Italian Army for use in repelling attacks by the Austro-Hungarian Army, although the turrets were left aboard. Queen became flagship of British Naval Forces, Taranto, serving as such until February 1918. Postwar career Queen left Taranto and returned to the United Kingdom in April 1919 and was placed on the disposal list at Chatham Dockyard in May 1919. She won a temporary reprieve from the scrapper's torch in June 1919 when she was removed from the list and attached to the Pembroke Establishment to serve as an accommodation ship. Queen was placed on the sale list in March 1920 and sold for scrap on 4 September 1920. She arrived at Birkenhead on 25 November 1920 to be lightened so that she could reach her scrapping berth at Preston, then arrived at Preston to be broken up on 5 August 1921.

Commonly known as the Spectacular Rustgill, this large orange mushroom is typically found growing on tree stumps, logs, or tree bases. Some subspecies of this mushroom contain the neurotoxic oligoisoprenoid gymnopilin. Taxonomy This species was formerly known as Gymnopilus spectabilis, or Pholiota spectabilis v. junonia (Fr.) J.E Lange. The 'Gymn' in the present nomen means 'naked', and 'Juno' was the wife of Jupiter. Description The cap ranges from 7 to 20 cm across, is convex, and is bright yellow-orange in younger specimens and orange/brown or reddish brown in older ones, with a dry scaly surface. The stem is 2.5 to 26.5 cm long, 1 to 4 cm thick, and often narrows near the base. The frail ring is dusted with rusty orange spores, the flesh is yellow and the gill attachment to the stem is adnate to sub- decurrent. It has a bitter taste, stains red with KOH and turns green when cooked in a pan. The spore print is rusty orange. It never bruises blue, unlike its psychoactive relatives. This mushroom usually grows in clusters from several to several dozen individuals, but sometimes grows solitary.

These species include G. aeruginosus, G. braendlei, G. cyanopalmicola, G. intermedius, G. junonius, G. luteofolius, G. luteoviridis, G. luteus, G. purpuratus, G. subearlei, G. subpurpuratus, G. validipes and G. viridans.Gymnopilus Chemistry, Entheogen review, Vol VII No. 3 Subspecies of G. junonius from Japan are reported to contain psilocybin, while some western North American members are inactive.http://www.svims.ca/ff0608.pdf Several species of Gymnopilus contain bis-noryangonin [4-hydroxy-6-(4-hydrostyryl)-2-pyrone] and hispidine [4-hydroxy-6-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)-2-pyrone], which are closely related to the alpha-pyrones found in kava. Phylogenetics A 2003 phylogenetics study identified five well-supported clades within Gymnopilus: # the spectabilis- imperialis group # nevadensis-penetrans group # a clade formed by G. underwoodii, G. validipes and G. cf. flavidellus # aeruginosus-luteofolius group # lepidotus-subearlei group Although the genus Gymnopilus was found to be monophyletic, the phylogenetically related groups do not support the traditional infrageneric classifications based on morphology.

Frank Baum, published in 1901 by the George M. Hill Company, the firm that issued The Wonderful Wizard of Oz the previous year. The cover, title page, and page borders were designed by Ralph Fletcher Seymour; each story was furnished with two full-page black-and-white illustrations, by either Harry Kennedy,Harry Kennedy had illustrated two of Baum's earlier books, The Army Alphabet and The Navy Alphabet (both published in 1900). Ike Morgan,Ike Morgan later illustrated Baum's The Woggle-Bug Book (1905). or Norman P. Hall.Norman P. Hall later illustrated Baum's Aunt Jane's Nieces in the Red Cross (1915). Background L. Frank Baum was doing well in 1901, better than ever before in his life. He had written two popular books, Father Goose: His Book and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and was determined to capitalize on this success. In addition to American Fairy Tales, Baum's Dot and Tot of Merryland and The Master Key appeared in 1901. Publisher George M. Hill sold the serialization rights to the twelve stories in AFT to five major newspapers, the Pittsburgh Dispatch, The Boston Post, The Cincinnati Enquirer, the St. Louis Republic, and The Chicago Chronicle. The stories appeared between March 3 and May 19, 1901; the book followed in October. The first three papers used or adapted the book's illustrations for their publications of the stories, while the Chronicle and the Republic had their own staff artists do separate pictures. Book Design The first edition of AFT had an unusual and striking design: each page was furnished with a broad illustrated border done in pen-and-ink by Seymour, which took up more than half the surface of the page, like a medieval illuminated manuscript. This probably reflected the influence of the medieval- revival book designs produced in the late nineteenth century by William Morris at his Kelmscott Press. The stories The twelve stories were published in this order in the first edition. #\\"The Box of Robbers.\\" Illustrated by Ike Morgan. #\\"The Glass Dog.\\" Illustrated by Harry Kennedy. #\\"The Queen of Quok.\\" Morgan. #\\"The Girl Who Owned a Bear.\\" Kennedy. #\\"The Enchanted Types.\\" Morgan. #\\"The Laughing Hippopotamus.\\" Morgan. #\\"The Magic Bon Bons.\\" Morgan. #\\"The Capture of Father Time.\\" Kennedy. #\\"The Wonderful Pump.\\" The single story illustrated by N. P. Hall. #\\"The Dummy That Lived.\\" Morgan. #\\"The King of the Polar Bears.\\" Morgan. #\\"The Mandarin and the Butterfly.\\" Morgan. The stories, as critics have noted, lack the high-fantasy aspect of many other Baum works. With ironic or nonsensical morals attached to their ends, their tone is more satirical, glib, and tongue-in-cheek than is usual in children's stories; the serialization in newspapers for adult readers was appropriate for the materials. \\"The Magic Bon Bons\\" was the most popular of the tales, judging by number of reprints. Two of the stories, \\"The Enchanted Types\\" and \\"The Dummy That Lived,\\" employ knooks and ryls, the fairies that Baum would use in The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus the next year, 1902. \\"The Dummy That Lived\\" depends upon the idea of a department-store mannequin brought to life, an early expression of an idea that would be re-used by many later writers in television and films. (Baum's story \\"The Runaway Shadows,\\" published in newspapers in June 1901, was intended to be part of the collection, but was dropped prior to publication of the book.)Riley, p. 72. Later Editions Bobbs-Merrill, the firm that bought the rights to Baum's books when George M. Hill went out of business in February 1902, published a second edition of AFT in 1908, with a new cover and sixteen two-color illustrations by George Kerr to replace the originals by Morgan, Kennedy, and Hall. This second edition also added an Author's Note by Baum and three more stories‚Äî\\"The Strange Adventures of an Egg,\\" \\"The Ryl,\\" and \\"The Witchcraft of Mary-Marie.\\" A third edition that appeared c. 1923-24 dropped half the color illustrations; this edition kept the book in print as late as 1942. The order was shuffled, and ends with \\"King of the Polar Bears.\\" Adaptations Baum adapted \\"The Box of Robbers\\" and \\"The Magic Bon Bons\\" as chapters 1 and 3 of his lost film series, Violet's Dreams, both with Violet MacMillan in the role of child protagonist. The former was retitled A Box of Bandits for film. Baum worked on a stage version of \\"The Glass Dog,\\" but it was not produced and may not have been completed. In 2008, \\"The Glass Dog\\" was adapted for the fifteenth issue of Graphic Classics by Antonella Caputo and Brad Teare.

Biography A graduate of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, Hong was placed in command of the Japanese camps holding Allied (primarily U.S. and Filipino) prisoners of war in the Philippines during the latter part of World War II, where many of the camp guards were of Korean ethnicity. Hong was held responsible for all the atrocities committed by Imperial Japanese Army prison guards against allied POWs, and was hanged in 1946. Early career Hong, a member of the Namyang Hong clan, was born in 1889 to a yangban family in Anseong, Gyeonggi- do. In 1905, as the Eulsa Treaty was being signed, he entered into the military academy of the Korean Empire. With the abolishment of the academy in 1909, he transferred to Japan's as a government-financed student along with Crown Prince Yi Eun on the orders of dethroned Emperor Gojong. Soon after, he advanced to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. At that time, there were several students from the Empire of Korea enrolled at the military academy, and with the shock of the 1910 annexation of Korea by Japan, a few left the Academy to join in the movements for Korean independence, but most followed the lead of Ji Cheong-cheon, who argued that they should leave to fight only after having studied and developed their skills. A few, such as Hong, attempted to stay aloof from either movement, and largely parted ways with his classmates. In 1914, Hong graduated in the 26th class of the Academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant into the Imperial Japanese Army, and in 1923 graduated from the Army War College.However, despite this, he secretly maintained his friendship with Ji and other anti-Japanese activists in the Korean Liberation Army, and even supported Ji's family with his own funds, an action which could have put Hong himself in danger if he made even a small mistake. Rising through the ranks With the implementation of the s≈çshi- kaimei policy, Hong was under strong pressure to change his Korean name to a Japanese-style name, but he ignored the pressure and in the end did not change his name and kept his surname as Hong. Hong continued to demonstrate exceptional ability and was rapidly promoted through the ranks, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant general. From 1939-40, he was with the China Expeditionary Army. From 1940-41, he was assigned to the 1st Depot Division, and in 1941, he became the commander of the IJA 108th Infantry Brigade as a major general. In March 1944, he went to the Philippines to command all prisoner-of-war camps. He was promoted to lieutenant general in October of the same year, and remained in the Philippines under the 14th Area Army until the cessation of hostilities. Trial and execution After the war, Hong was tried in Manila before a military tribunal by the Allies over the conduct of his prison guards while he was commandant. The Manila tribunal sentenced Hong to death as a war criminal on 18 April 1946.Trial of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, United States Military Commission Manila Hong (left seated) at his war crimes trial in 1946 While in prison, Hong was reported to have converted to Christianity. He was hanged on 26 September 1946. Before he was executed, he requested the presiding minister to read Psalm 51, a plea by King David for God to wash away the sin of his adultery with Bathsheba. Later views After Korea regained its independence, Hong's family became the target of blame and ostracism by various factions in Korea. His eldest son, Hong Guk-seon, graduated from Japan's Waseda University and afterwards worked in the Bank of Ch≈çsen , but was removed from his position on the orders of Syngman Rhee. He and his mother, Hong's widow, later emigrated to the United States.Lee Gyu- Tae, quoted by Bibliography  References Category:1889 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People from Anseong Category:Converts to Christianity Category:Executed military personnel Category:Korean Christians Category:Japanese generals Category:Korean collaborators with Imperial Japan Category:Military history of Korea during World War II Category:Japanese people convicted of war crimes Category:Japanese people executed abroad Category:Japanese people of Korean descent Category:Executed Korean people Category:Executed Japanese people Category:People executed for war crimes Category:Japanese military leaders ","title":"Hong Sa-ik"},{"id":"8092583","text":"Professor Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius (January 4, 1925 in Juodausiai, Ukmergƒó district ‚Äì February 20, 2018 in Vilnius) was a leading Lithuanian linguist-historian, professor at Vilnius University, and a full member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences.

For points x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n in -dimensional space , the elements of their Euclidean distance matrix are given by squares of distances between them. That is :\\\\begin{align} A & = (a_{ij}); \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{ij} & = d_{ij}^2 \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\lVert x_i - x_j\\\\rVert^2 \\\\end{align} where \\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\denotes the Euclidean norm on . :A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & d_{12}^2 & d_{13}^2 & \\\\dots & d_{1n}^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{21}^2 & 0 & d_{23}^2 & \\\\dots & d_{2n}^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{31}^2 & d_{32}^2 & 0 & \\\\dots & d_{3n}^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots&\\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots&\\\\vdots& \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_{n1}^2 & d_{n2}^2 & d_{n3}^2 & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} In the context of (not necessarily Euclidean) distance matrices, the entries are usually defined directly as distances, not their squares. However, in the Euclidean case, squares of distances are used to avoid computing square roots and to simplify relevant theorems and algorithms. Euclidean distance matrices are closely related to Gram matrices (matrices of dot products, describing norms of vectors and angles between them). The latter are easily analyzed using methods of linear algebra. This allows to characterize Euclidean distance matrices and recover the points x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n that realize it. A realization, if it exists, is unique up to rigid transformations, i.e. distance-preserving transformations of Euclidean space (rotations, reflections, translations). In practical applications, distances are noisy measurements or come from arbitrary dissimilarity estimates (not necessarily metric). The goal may be to visualize such data by points in Euclidean space whose distance matrix approximates a given dissimilarity matrix as well as possible ‚Äî this is known as multidimensional scaling. Alternatively, given two sets of data already represented by points in Euclidean space, one may ask how similar they are in shape, that is, how closely can they be related by a distance-preserving transformation ‚Äî this is Procrustes analysis. Some of the distances may also be missing or come unlabelled (as an unordered set or multiset instead of a matrix), leading to more complex algorithmic tasks, such as the graph realization problem or the turnpike problem (for points on a line). Properties By the fact that Euclidean distance is a metric, the matrix has the following properties. * All elements on the diagonal of are zero (i.e. it is a hollow matrix); hence the trace of is zero. * is symmetric (i.e. a_{ij} = a_{ji}). * \\\\sqrt{a_{ij}} \\\\le \\\\sqrt{a_{ik}} + \\\\sqrt{a_{kj}} (by the triangle inequality) * a_{ij}\\\\ge 0 In dimension , a Euclidean distance matrix has rank less than or equal to . If the points x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n are in general position, the rank is exactly Distances can be shrunk by any power to obtain another Euclidean distance matrix. That is, if A=(a_{ij}) is an Euclidean distance matrix, then ({a_{ij}}^s) is an Euclidean distance matrix for every . Theorem 2.6 Relation to Gram matrix The Gram matrix of a sequence of points x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n in -dimensional space is the matrix G = (g_{ij}) of their dot products (here a point x_i is thought of as a vector from 0 to that point): : g_{ij} = x_i \\\\cdot x_j = \\\\|x_i\\\\\\\\|x_j\\\\\\\\cos \\\\theta, where \\\\theta is the angle between the vector x_i and x_j. In particular : g_{ii} = \\\\|x_i\\\\|^2 is the square of the distance of x_i from 0. Thus the Gram matrix describes norms and angles of vectors (from 0 to) x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n. Let X be the matrix containing x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n as columns. Then : G = X^\\\\textsf{T} X, because g_{ij} = x_i^\\\\textsf{T} x_j (seeing x_i as a column vector). Matrices that can be decomposed as X^\\\\textsf{T}X, that is, Gram matrices of some sequence of vectors (columns of X), are well understood ‚Äî these are precisely positive semidefinite matrices. To relate the Euclidean distance matrix to the Gram matrix, observe that : d_{ij}^2 = \\\\|x_i - x_j\\\\|^2 = (x_i - x_j)^\\\\textsf{T} (x_i - x_j) = x_i^\\\\textsf{T} x_i - 2x_i^\\\\textsf{T} x_j + x_j^\\\\textsf{T} x_j = g_{ii} -2g_{ij} + g_{jj} That is, the norms and angles determine the distances. Note that the Gram matrix contains additional information: distances from 0. Conversely, distances d_{ij} between pairs of points x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n determine dot products between vectors x_i-x_0 (): : g_{ij} = (x_i-x_0) \\\\cdot (x_j-x_0) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\|x_i-x_0\\\\|^2 + \\\\|x_j- x_0\\\\|^2 - \\\\|x_i - x_j\\\\|^2 \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(d_{0i}^2 + d_{0j}^2 - d_{ij}^2) (this is known as the polarization identity). Characterizations For a matrix , a sequence of points x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n in -dimensional Euclidean space is called a realization of in if is their Euclidean distance matrix. One can assume without loss of generality that x_1 = \\\\mathbf{0} (because translating by -x_1 preserves distances). This follows from the previous discussion because is positive semidefinite of rank at most if and only if it can be decomposed as G = X^\\\\textsf{T} X where is an matrix., Theorem 2.2.1, p. 10 Moreover, the columns of give a realization in . Therefore, any method to decompose allows to find a realization. The two main approaches are variants of Cholesky decomposition or using spectral decompositions to find the principal square root of , see Definite matrix#Decomposition. The statement of theorem distinguishes the first point x_1. A more symmetric variant of the same theorem is the following: Other characterizations involve Cayley‚ÄìMenger determinants. In particular, these allow to show that a symmetric hollow matrix is realizable in if and only if every principal submatrix is. In other words, a semimetric on finitely many points is embedabble isometrically in if and only if every points are. In practice, the definiteness or rank conditions may fail due to numerical errors, noise in measurements, or due to the data not coming from actual Euclidean distances. Points that realize optimally similar distances can then be found by semidefinite approximation (and low rank approximation, if desired) using linear algebraic tools such as singular value decomposition or semidefinite programming. This is known as multidimensional scaling. Variants of these methods can also deal with incomplete distance data. Unlabeled data, that is, a set or multiset of distances not assigned to particular pairs, is much more difficult to deal with. Such data arises, for example, in DNA sequencing (specifically, genome recovery from partial digest) or phase retrieval. Two sets of points are called homometric if they have the same multiset of distances (but are not necessarily related by a rigid transformation). Deciding whether a given multiset of distances can be realized in a given dimension is strongly NP-hard. In one dimension this is known as the turnpike problem; it is an open question whether it can be solved in polynomial time. When the multiset of distances is given with error bars, even the one dimensional case is NP-hard. Nevertheless, practical algorithms exist for many cases, e.g. random points. Uniqueness of representations Given a Euclidean distance matrix, the sequence of points that realize it is unique up to rigid transformations ‚Äì these are isometries of Euclidean space: rotations, reflections, translations, and their compositions. Rigid transformations preserve distances so one direction is clear. Suppose the distances \\\\|x_i-x_j\\\\and \\\\|y_i-y_j\\\\are equal. Without loss of generality we can assume x_1=y_1=\\\\textbf{0} by translating the points by -x_1 and -y_1, respectively. Then the Gram matrix of remaining vectors x_i=x_i-x_1 is identical to the Gram matrix of vectors y_i (). That is, X^\\\\textsf{T} X = Y^\\\\textsf{T} Y, where and are the matrices containing the respective vectors as columns. This implies there exists an orthogonal matrix such that , see Definite symmetric matrix#Uniqueness up to unitary transformations. describes an orthogonal transformation of (a composition of rotations and reflections, without translations) which maps x_i to y_i (and 0 to 0). The final rigid transformation is described by T(x) = Q(x-x_1)+y_1. In applications, when distances don't match exactly, Procrustes analysis aims to relate two point sets as close as possible via rigid transformations, usually using singular value decomposition. The ordinary Euclidean case is known as the orthogonal Procrustes problem or Wahba's problem (when observations are weighted to account for varying uncertainties). Examples of applications include determining orientations of satellites, comparing molecule structure (in cheminformatics), protein structure (structural alignment in bioinformatics), or bone structure (statistical shape analysis in biology).

He was played by Daniel Benzali. Ted is head of the law firm of Hoffman & Associates, specializing in criminal defense. Though his profession is typically looked down on by many, Ted maintains a high degree of personal and professional integrity, and expects the same from those who work for him. He is not hesitant to fire employees who engage in unethical activities, even when it helps their cases. After learning of the murder of fifteen-year-old call girl Jessica Costello, Ted is hired by millionaire Richard Cross to represent him in the matter. Richard owned the building where Jessica was murdered and has been having an affair with her older sister Julie. Richard insists his innocence though Ted suspects he knows more than he's telling. After a witness provides Richard with an alibi and charges are dropped, noted movie actor Neil Avedon, who was seeing Jessica, is charged with the crime. At Richard's urging, Ted reluctantly agrees to represent Neil. Because of Neil's celebrity and the notoriety of the murder, the trial quickly becomes a high-profile media event. Though Richard claims to be Neil's friend, Ted suspects Richard is manipulating events for unknown reasons. After David Blalock, a private investigator working for Ted, claims to have found a video tape undermining Richard's alibi, Blalock is found dead and the tape missing. The trial also puts a strain on Ted's personal life. His work on the case demands long hours away from his family. He also receives a shock when his daughter is abducted, though she is found safe soon after. The publicity of the trial eventually becomes too much for Ted's wife Annie and she files for divorce. After a lengthy and exhausting trial with many twists and turns, the jury finds Neil guilty of murder. While preparing the appeal, Ted recalls Richard's history of being a voyeur, and begins to suspect that he may have installed a camera in Jessica's bedroom, a camera that may have recorded her murder. With the help of Ray Velacek, Blalock's successor, they sneak in to the apartment and find the camera, though the tape has been removed. Ted urges Richard, who is now dying of AIDS, to give him the tape. Jessica's real killer is revealed on the tape and Neil is exonerated. With the pressure of the trial finally behind him, Ted eventually leaves the firm to attempt a reconciliation with his wife.

The point of the analogy is that a national and international institution (the All England Club) can be highly successful despite the lack of strong native competition, as in modern tennis Britain has produced very few Wimbledon champions, with only Ann Haydon Jones, Virginia Wade (both women's singles), Jonathan Marray (men's doubles), Andy Murray (men's singles), John Lloyd, Jeremy Bates, Jo Durie, Jamie Murray and Heather Watson (mixed doubles) winning titles in the Open Era. Financial context London's financial industry has boomed since the deregulation of British financial markets (the \\"Big Bang\\") in the 1980s under the Thatcher government ‚Äî but has also become dominated by foreign companies, especially American investment banks, rather than British firms (a result opposite to the original intention of the reforms). The analogy is typically used to mark a debate over whether it matters if an industry is primarily domestically owned if easing of foreign ownership restrictions allows the economy to benefit from foreign investment and increased global competition. The phrase can be used positively to assert the economic success of liberal attitudes towards foreign ownership (and sometimes to emphasize that such attitudes promote a level playing field for domestic and foreign interests alike); or it can be used negatively to emphasize how these policies have eroded a nation's ability to produce globally leading domestic companies. This opposing perspective is represented by economic patriotism and \\"national champion\\" policies. The 68th yokozuna Asasyoryu and the 69th yokozuna Hakuho, who are both from Mongolia The analogy has also been used in policy discourses outside Britain ‚Äì most notably in the business discourse of Japan,Sprague, Jonathan : \\"Foreigners at the Wheel : A new boss at scandal-hit Mitsubishi Motors\\", 22 September 2000, Asiaweek.com\\"DATABASE: GLOSSARY OF JAPANESE TERMS\\" , ANALYTICA JAPAN: FINANCIAL RESEARCH whose financial markets and other parts of the economy (as of 2006) have not yet been substantially opened up to foreign competition compared with its international peers. It has also, for instance, been used in banking reform debates in South Korea as well as in discussing business process outsourcing in India.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/createpdf.cfm?articleid=875 Sports in Japan The term has also frequently been appearing in sports in Japan since late 20th century, including sumo where there has been only one Japanese-born yokozuna since 1998 as most of the top players have been from Mongolia or Polynesia. Similarly in combat sports (kakutougi), K-1 was the biggest kickboxing promotion of the world, whereas Pride Fighting Championships was the biggest mixed martial arts promotion of the world. Nevertheless, both K-1 and Pride had few Japanese-born popular players or champions. The vast majority of prominent competitors in K-1 came from the Netherlands or Thailand, while Pride's biggest names were from Brazil, United States, and Russia.

Situated 21 km northwest of Porto, it is part of the Greater Metropolitan Area of Porto. The population in 2011 was 3,491,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 5.74 km¬≤. History The monument to Liberal forces that disembarked during the campaign to restore Queen Maria I of Portugal :\\"Great little smell of pine, I don't know others similar, Of the pinery of Mindelo, Which is a beautiful pinery, Where in Azurara begins, And in Porto ends...\\" Jos√© R√©gio (2001) A land with more than 1000 years of history, the first documents from Mindelo date back to the 10th century. The first registered reference to the region, dates back to 1068, to the village of Amidjelus, that would become Mindelo. Other resources suggest that the local toponymy developed from the terms Amenidello, Amenitello, Amenitelo or Menidello, from the name of a knight, during the age of Vimara Peres, who settled in the area and battled Arab forces. Ancestral records and property titles are also mentioned in successive records for 1069, 1081, 1082, 1095 and 1127. After administrative reforms in 1258, clearer records identified the places within the parish, such as Igreja, Passos, Pinheiro, Gondosendo, Outeiro, Manhalde and Paredes. Each of these localities were composed of many families, while a few pertained specifically to the King. This was related to Medieval donations of land or testaments that left many of those properties in the hands of the church, such as the Monasteries of Vair√£o, Moreira, Santo Tirso and Roriz. In 1081, Mindelo had their own religious temple, located in Burgal (which itself received its name from its populational movement, developed from the toponumy burgh). The current parochial church dates back to the 18th century, with contracts signed with quarrymen and carpenters in 1770, during a period of Portuguese religious construction. In the 16th century, King Manuel of Portugal in √âvora issued a regal charter () to the municipality of Maia, which included Mindelo at the time. Since 6 November 1836, it was integrated into the municipality of Vila do Conde. The delineation of the parish of Mindelo dates back to 1611. On 20 October of that year, the Monastery of Moreira defined the limits of the ecclesiastical parish in the presence of the abbeys of Fajozes and Vila Ch√£, representatives of Cabido da S√© do Porto and the Monastery of Vair√£o. Ant√≥nio do Carmo Reis (1997) referred to Mindelo \\" until the first decades of the 20th century, Mindelo was a vast area between the River Ave and the mouth of the River Le√ßa, with, canonically, a clergy of the C√≥negos Regrantes de Santo Agostinho, in the Convent of Moreira da Maia\\". The village, and in particular the beaches between Mindelo and Pampelido, were important in the being the location for the landing of Liberal forces during the Liberal Wars. Under the command of Peter IV, the troops, later referred to as the Bravos do Mindelo (), arriving from the Azores, disembarked along the beach on 8 July 1832, before proceeding to Porto. Geography Physical geography Mindelo is part of the Porto Metropolitan Area, in the coastal part of northwestern Portugal. It is located 5 kilometres southeast of the municipal seat (Vila do Conde), 8 kilometres from the harbour of P√≥voa de Varzim and 21 kilometres northwest of the city of Porto. Ecoregions/Protected areas The Reserva Ornitol√≥gica de Mindelo (ROM) (), created on 2 September 1957, through the initiative of Santos J√∫nior, is the first protected area created in Portugal, and the only coastal area in the Porto Metropolitan Area that has maintained its natural characteristics. The area is around six km¬≤ and includes parts of the beaches, farmlands, botanical gardens and areas of Ribeira de Silvares. The Ornithological Reserve features avian scientific studies and includes 150 species of birds, in addition to mammals and amphibian species. With the creation of the √Årea de Paisagem Protegida do Litoral de Vila do Conde the parish has begun to concentrate on eco-tourism. Human geography The parish contains the settlements Igreja, Gondosendo, Manhalde, Outeiro, Paredes, Passos and Pinheiro. Mindelo is accessed with the national road N13 and the A28 motorway. It has a station on the Porto Metro Line B. It is 9 km northwest from Francisco S√° Carneiro Airport. Economy Initially, the community was based in agriculture, then later fishery, and lastly seasonal tourism. Today, agriculture and industry remain essential to the local economy, in particular textiles. Mindelo is the first parish in Portugal to have the Agenda 21 local, an involvement on the community on identification problems and the definition of prioritites, as well as its quality of life. Architecture * Church of S√£o Jo√£o Evangelista () - dating back to the 18th century; * Chapel of S√£o Pedro dos Mareabtes () - constructed in the 20th century Other buildings typical of the parish, and important architectural, are related with agriculture and include the buildings along the Rua do Covelo and Rua de Paredes, in addition to the Vila Corina estate (dating back to the 19th century), but today operating as a lyceum. Culture The parish has several community groups that support local initiatives, including the Associa√ß√£o dos Amigos do Mindelo para a Defesa do Ambiente (an environmental group), the Associa√ß√£o Cultural e Desportiva de Mindelo (ACDM) (a sports association), the Associa√ß√£o Recreativa Rancho Regional de Mindelo (ARRRM) (a choral group), the Centro Social de Mindelo ‚Äì IPSS (community centre) and the Corpo Nacional de Escutas ‚Äì Agrupamento 572 (scouts). Apart from religious celebrations throughout many of the villages, the parish is known for the Festival de concertinas e cantares ao desafio (occurring in the spring), and the Festival Folcl√≥rico (in the second Sunday in August). Sport Located along the seaside, Mindelo possesses special conditions to support water sports. Surfing, bodyboading and kite-surfing are practiced by locals and visiters from Grande Porto, since 1990, including at the beach of Pinhal (to the north). References External links *Escola EB 2,3 D.

The highway runs through a rural area of the southwestern part of the state. It has been a part of the highway system since 1935; the current form of the roadway was finalized in 1939. Between 2,400 and 3,900 vehicles use the highway each day on average. Route description M-216 begins at a junction with M-40 in the village of Marcellus to the southwest of Kalamazoo. The highway follows Main Street eastward in the village, crossing a branch line of the Canadian National Railway. East of town, M-216 passes through farm fields and jogs to the south around Lewis Lake. The highway runs along Marcellus Road through the rural landscape that is a mix of farm fields and woods. The trunkline crosses the Cass ‚Äì St. Joseph county line before running through the unincorporated community of Howardsville in Flowerfield Township. After passing by the Pine View Golf Club, the road comes to its end at US 131. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-216 like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2009 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-216 were the 3,853 vehicles daily in the village of Marcellus; the lowest counts were the 2,421 vehicles immediately east of town. No section of M-216 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History M-216 has existed in its current location since its creation in 1935. Two sets of changes to the roadway were made in the late 1930s. The first came in late 1938 when a new long segment was newly built to replace an segment which contained sharp turns. In 1939, the road paving was completed.

Quantum Gate sold over 100,000 units (a commercial benchmark achieved by few titles in 1993) and was regarded as a technical and artistic breakthrough in PC entertainment design. The game also had a sequel titled Vortex and also a book. Plot The player takes on the role of Private Drew Griffin, an army medical student in the year 2057 who is recruited by the UN on a secret mission to an alien world where water is scarce. During the mission briefing Drew discovers that an advanced environmental simulation program called Earth-5 has predicted that there are only five years remaining before irreversible ecological damage caused by industrialisation, pollution and the overuse and destruction of natural resources will cause the Earth's demise. The Eden Initiative, of which this mission is the major part, is a project aimed at saving Earth from this Armageddon. The key to this is the rare mineral iridium oxide, found on the harsh alien planet AJ3905. AJ3905 is a world accessible only through an interplanetary device called the Quantum Gate and the mission involves a series of mining expeditions to extract the mineral and bring it back to Earth. However, AJ3905's hellish atmosphere consists of a poisonous, caustic gas that promises an agonising death for unprotected humans which requires the wearing of a protective suit (known as a 'Tophat'). Furthermore, it is occupied by a hostile life form that appear as frighteningly skeletal anthropomorphic forms through the Tophat's virtual reality display. It is the role of Griffin and his fellow army recruits to protect the scientific mining crew during their repeated forays to the planet. During mission downtime, the player's interaction with other characters such as the commanding officer, Colonel Saunders, and the inventor of the Quantum Gate, Dr. Elizabeth Marks, start to raise concerns about the nature of the mission. Further enhanced when Griffin's apparently paranoid army buddy, Private Michaels, starts telling tales of great conspiracy to hide the true agenda of the Eden Initiative. These start to suggest to the player that the nature of the planet itself and the possible reason for the protective suits are elaborate fabrications. The extreme interpretation is that the Earth is doomed no matter what and instead of protecting peaceful miners from a hostile alien race, the army is involved in the genocide of a native species prior to human colonisation. Between these sequences and the occasional training mission or visit to the planet, a series of flashbacks and electronic messages from home reveal a dark backstory about Private Griffin. Through events for which Griffin feels remorse his girlfriend has become partially disfigured, although it is never made clear what those events were or that they were even Griffin's fault. They appear to have spurred Griffin, who had previously been pursuing a promising career in medicine, to run away from home and join the military. The full history of Griffin is never completely explained in the game and the details are kept deliberately vague and unresolved leaving the player to decide whether Griffin's remorse is for an accident for which he is to blame, or merely for having run away. Additional touches such as the heavy censorship of messages from home suggest that, for the army recruits at least, participation in this mission may be punitive. During the final mission of the game Griffin is attacked and immobilised. His Tophat and life support system start to fail and an alien looms over him. Despite his pleas for mercy the alien works his helmet loose and removes it. However, without the VR filter, the planet is revealed as a green and living world, and the demonlike alien as a curious-looking female humanoid (revealed in the sequel to be a peaceful, winged race known as the Alylinde). Griffin's last words as the screen goes black are \\"My God. They're human\\". Gameplay As the game progresses the overall feel becomes increasingly dark; from the initial briefing which consists of confronting images of dying animals, famine and industrial pollution, through the increasingly paranoid rantings of Private Michaels to the distressed and teary messages from Griffins mother and girlfriend. The gameplay itself is extremely linear in nature, as is normally exhibited by interactive movies and the player's input is limited to conversing with other characters (through a choice of pre-existing phrases) and some involvement during missions. The game is unusual in that the player 'wins' only by having their character die (or possibly fall unconscious as this, like so much else in the game, is never made completely clear). This allows the shock-conclusion reveal of the true nature of the planet and its inhabitants, and hence the most likely truth of the character's own participation in genocide. For these reasons the game and its message are quite confronting. Reception Computer Gaming World said in March 1994 that Quantum Gate had good acting and was \\"one of the most engaging CD titles yet to appear\\". In April 1994 the magazine said that it \\"packs a good entertainment punch\\" and \\"interesting\\", but \\"it's still a game‚Äînot the great leap beyond the marketing folks would have you believe\\". Charles Ardai in June 1994 complained that Quantum Gate was‚Äîcontrary to its marketing‚Äî\\"hardly a game at all [but] a movie\\", as players could not affect the plot. He denounced the first-person tank sequences as \\"the less said about which the better\\", and said that as a game \\"Quantum Gate deserves a scathing review\\". Ardai praised it as a science-fiction movie (the best since Blade Runner), however, citing \\"simply outstanding\\" acting and video and comparing the \\"shockingly adult and shockingly good\\" script to Philip K. Dick and Fredric Brown. He concluded that Quantum Gate \\"is a hell of a good movie, period, with a story that sticks with you long after the final credits roll\\". The game was reviewed in 1994 in Dragon #212 by Ken Rolston in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Rolston states, \\"I casually recommend it as a quick, simple entertainment, and of special interest to students of narrative multimedia, but it's not much of a game, and not completely successful on its own narrative terms.\\" Production Greg Roach wrote and designed the title which follows the story of Drew Griffin, a military recruit in a base on a far off planet, preparing for a war with an alien species. Originally the two releases, Quantum Gate and The Vortex, were written and designed as a single story/experience, but the publisher, Media Vision, exercised an acceleration clause in the development contract and demanded the title months ahead of the original release date - causing the developers to have to split the title into two. As a result, The Vortex was redesigned to allow its story to stand alone. Sequel Vortex (also known as The Vortex: Quantum Gate II) is the 1994 sequel to Quantum Gate by Hyperbole Studios for Mac and Windows. The game tells the adventures of an army grunt in a futuristic (but medieval like) society where water is scarce. The game was developed using Softimage and VirtualCinema. Entertainment Weekly gave the game a C.

These individuals earned wealth primarily in parcels of land \\"awarded\\" or ‚Äúsold‚Äù to them by the government. For many years they were the predominant indigenous group in the Kenyan economy, controlling tea and coffee plantations, and retaining heavy influence over the tertiary sector as it developed. Due to the influence the Kiambu mafia had, they could acquire lands from peasants in Central Province in exchange with bigger parcels of land in Rift Valley Province. The plutocratic style adopted by the government of the day allowed them easy access to essential resources. Many of these individuals were well educated, having attended universities inside and outside Kenya. However it must be appreciated that there are individuals associated with the Kiambu Mafia not from the Kiambu district. When Kenyatta's health started to deteriorate, the Kiambu Mafia was concerned about their continuing influence and so they decided to plan the succession in the event Kenyatta died by trying to amend the constitution so that the Vice president would not automatically hold power till the election is held. Charles Mugane Njonjo, who was one of the mafia, but differed with them due to his apparent interests in the presidency which the group members were not prepared to support, came out strongly opposing the succession talks by saying it was in fact treason to even imagine the death of a sitting president. Political analysts and historians are of the opinion that Njonjo considered Moi a weak politician and was of the view that it would be easier to take the presidency from him rather than any of the Kiambu mafia. When Moi came into power in 1978, he abolished all the \\"tribal\\" movements but his main aim was the GEMA, many of whose members were part of the Kiambu mafia as he was not comfortable with the huge wealth and power its members controlled.

Pope Pius XII made him a cardinal in 1953. Biography Tombstone of Cardinal Lercaro in the San Pietro Cathedral, Bologna Early life and ordination Giacomo Lercaro was born in Quinto al Mare, Genoa, as the eighth of nine children. He came from a family of seamen, and two of his brothers, Amedeo and Attilio, also entered religion. From 1902 to 1914, Lercaro attended the archdiocesan seminary in Genoa. He was ordained a priest on 25 July 1914 by Archbishop Ildefonso Pisani, and four months later, in November, traveled to Rome to study at the Pontifical Biblical Institute.  Pastoral and theological work  When Italy entered World War I, Lercaro was forced to change posts and become a military chaplain until the war ended in 1918. In 1918, he became Prefect of the Seminary of Genoa, where his brother Amedeo was rector, and would remain in that post until 1923. He also served as substitute professor of theology (1921‚Äì1923) and professor of Sacred Scripture and Patrology (1923‚Äì1927). In 1927 he became a teacher of religion in secondary school and became involved in numerous student movements in the Genoa district. Archbishop He received his episcopal consecration on 19 March 1947 from Archbishop Giuseppe Siri, with Archbishop Angleo Rossini and Bishop Francesco Canessa serving as co-consecrators. In the consistory of 12 January 1953, Lercaro was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Traspontina by Pius XII. Cardinal During his early years as a cardinal, Lercaro established his first contacts with Angelo Roncalli and became well known for the way in which he turned his episcopal palace into an orphanage. Although he had been seen by Vatican- watchers ever since 1953 as a possible successor to Pius XII and was listed by l'Osservatore Romano as a papabile, his reputation as the most idiosyncratic of all the Cardinals and the desire for a transitional pontiff saw him passed over in favour of Roncalli in 1958. Generally considered papabile in the 1963 papal conclave closest to the vision of John XXIII, Lercaro, however, was considered too liberal by most of his fellow cardinal electors to be elected; Giovanni Battista Montini ultimately won. Although Cardinal Lercaro did much vital work in implementing the Council after it closed in 1965, his advancing age saw him gradually disappear from prominence within the Church as the 1960s drew to a close. On 12 February 1968, Cardinal Lercaro stepped down from his position as Archbishop of Bologna and in 1971, he lost his right to participate in any future conclave upon reaching the age of eighty according to the then-recent motu proprio Ingravescentem aetatem. Death Lercaro died from a cardiac crisis in Bologna, ten days short of his 85th birthday. He was buried in the metropolitan cathedral of that city. Views Anti- fascism His involvement in these student movements gave Lercaro a great interest in engaging Catholic theology with modern culture, and during the war he became one of the most prominent anti-Fascists within the Church, preaching steadfastly against Nazism and offering support in his home for those persecuted by Mussolini--most notably for Italian Jews whose persecution began as a result of Italy's collaboration with Nazi Germany. At one point during World War II Lercaro was forced to operate under the alias of \\"Father Lorenzo Gusmini\\" and live in a vacant monastery cell to avoid being killed by Nazi collaborators. Anti-communism Lercaro's reputation as an outspoken critic of Communism is believed to be a contributing factor in Pope Pius XII's decision to make him the first Archbishop of Ravenna (31 January 1947) and then the twentieth Archbishop of Bologna (19 April 1952), both considered among the largest Italian cities under Communist rule. Second Vatican Council Even though Lercaro felt that Pope John was moving much too quickly when he first announced the Second Vatican Council in late 1959, he later sat on its Board of Presidency and became regarded as one of the main architects of the Council's liturgical reforms. Church of the poor Cardinal Lercaro was also the first to popularise the theory of a \\"Church of the poor\\" that developed further in Latin America during the 1970s. During his tenure as archbishop of Bologna, where the most popular political party was the Italian Communist Party, he tried to build a dialogue with the members of this party.

Route description First sign for north NC 200 after the state line NC 522 at NC 200 in Roughedge NC 200 traverses , starting at the South Carolina state line, through the city of Monroe, and the towns of Stanfield and Locust, before ending at US 601 near Concord. For its length, it is a two-lane rural highway except in Monroe where it is a four-lane road from Charlotte Avenue to US 74 and a six-lane divided highway on its concurrency with US 74 and US 601. History Established in 1930, it traveled from Monroe at US 74/NC 20/NC 25/NC 151 south to the South Carolina state line where it changed into SC 93 (renumbered to SC 200 in 1937). Between 1931-36, NC 200 was realigned north of Old Highway Road near Jackson. In 1936, the highway was extended north via Franklin Street, Church Street, Winchester Street, and finally Morgan Mill Road to NC 27 in Locust. In 1942, the highway was extended again north to current terminus at NC 151 (renumbered to US 601 in 1951). About 1958, NC 200 was rerouted in Monroe to follow Morrow Road and Haynes Street onto new bypass US 74/US 601, then return on Morgan Mill Road. By 1982, it had reverted to follow along Charlotte Avenue and Church Street. NC 200 was rerouted northwest on a new road around downtown Monroe in August 2011 utilizing Martin Luther King Boulevard and Dickerson Boulevard to connect with US 74\\\\. The old alignment, Lancaster Avenue and Charlotte Avenue to Franklin Street, was downgraded to a secondary road. NC 75 was extended, replacing NC 200 from Franklin Street to Haynes Street, via Charlotte Avenue and Church Street. NC 207 was also extended, replacing NC 200 from Church Street to US 74/US 601 (Roosevelt Boulevard), along Haynes Street/Skyway Drive.

The Basislico chilote is described as having the crest of a rooster and the body of a serpent. It is hatched from an egg that is incubated by a rooster and lives in a hole which it digs under a house. It feeds on the phlegm and saliva of the people who live in the house, causing the inhabitants to dehydrate and eventually die. To kill Basilisco chilote, you must burn the egg as soon as it is laid and kill the chicken that laid it, to prevent further eggs from being laid. Once hatched the only way to destroy it is by burning down the house where it lives. This myth is based upon myths of the Colo Colo and the basilisk, but borrows more from the tradition of the cockatrice, which itself draws from the basilisk.

Biography Early years Raphael Sch√§fer was born in 1979 as a member of the German minority in the Upper Silesian town of Kƒôdzierzyn-Ko≈∫le and in 1986 with his father emigrated from Poland as Aussiedler to settle in northern Germany. Raphael Sch√§fer learned German in a few months. Sch√§fer began his footballing career at SC Drispenstedt in a suburb of Hildesheim. At the age of 12 he was scouted by Hannover 96 and joined the ranks of their youth teams. He became part of the first-team squad with 17 but never made it into the starting line-up. Thus, he decided to join Regionalliga side VfB L√ºbeck before the 1998‚Äì99 season. At L√ºbeck he quickly became the first-choice goalkeeper but his team failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga in three consecutive seasons. 1. FC N√ºrnberg Raphael Sch√§fer Sch√§fer transferred to 1. FC N√ºrnberg in July 2001. The club had just been promoted to the Bundesliga and he became the second choice goalkeeper behind former German Under-21-international Darius Kampa. When Kampa had a series of weak showings for the team, coach Klaus Augenthaler gave Sch√§fer the chance to shine in his first Bundesliga game against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach in March 2002. Despite playing a good game, Sch√§fer still remained as second choice as Augenthaler still considered Kampa his first choice keeper. When the club was relegated the following year, Sch√§fer had played three games for the Franconian side. At the start of the 2003‚Äì04 season, N√ºrnberg were plagued by financial trouble and looking to cash in on several players including Kampa. Manager Wolfgang Wolf appointed Sch√§fer as the first choice goalkeeper as he expected Kampa to leave the club before August 2003. However, Kampa was not sold but Sch√§fer remained the number one goalkeeper. He stayed in this position throughout the entire season despite substantial fan backing for his rival, Kampa. Even after Kampa was sold to M√∂nchengladbach before the 2004‚Äì05 season, which saw N√ºrnberg back in the top flight, Sch√§fer still had to fight off skepticism in his abilities from parts of the N√ºrnberg supporters. He answered his critics by showing substantial improvements throughout the following two seasons and was voted skipper of the N√ºrnberg team before the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season. VfB Stuttgart In July 2007, he moved to N√ºrnberg's Bundesliga rival VfB Stuttgart, making his debut for them on 10 August against Schalke 04. However, his performances were not as they were expected to be and he could not live up to the expectations. In summer 2008, he was replaced by Jens Lehmann as Stuttgart's number one keeper. Return to N√ºrnberg In summer 2008, Sch√§fer returned to 1. FC N√ºrnberg and immediately became number one keeper again. Honours ;1.

He is known for writing the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, about a teenager named Percy Jackson who discovers he is a son of the Greek god Poseidon. Riordan's books have been translated into forty-two languages and sold more than thirty million copies in the US. 20th Century Fox has adapted the first two books of his Percy Jackson series as part of a series of films. His books have spawned related media, such as graphic novels and short story collections. Riordan's first full-length novel was Big Red Tequila, which became the first book in the Tres Navarre series. His big breakthrough was The Lightning Thief (2005), the first novel in the five-volume Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, which placed a group of adolescents in a Greco-Roman mythological setting. Since then, Riordan has written The Kane Chronicles trilogy and The Heroes of Olympus series. The Kane Chronicles (2010-2012) focused on Egyptian mythology; The Heroes of Olympus was the sequel to the Percy Jackson series. Riordan also helped Scholastic Press develop The 39 Clues series and its spinoffs, and penned its first book, The Maze of Bones (2008). His most recent publications are three books in the Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard series, based on Norse mythology. The first book of his The Trials of Apollo series, The Hidden Oracle, was released in May 2016. Life and career Riordan at the 2007 Texas Book Festival with advance publicity for The Battle of the Labyrinth Riordan was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. He graduated from Alamo Heights High School, and first attended the music program at North Texas State University, wanting to be a guitarist. He transferred to the University of Texas at Austin and studied English and History. He received his teaching certification in those subjects from the University of Texas at San Antonio. He taught English and Social Studies for eight years at Presidio Hill School in San Francisco. Rick married Becky Riordan in 1985 on the couple's shared birthday. They have two sons, Haley and Patrick. They moved from San Antonio to Boston in June 2013, in conjunction with older son Haley starting college in Boston. Riordan has created several successful book series. Tres Navarre, an adult mystery series about a Texas private eye, won the Shamus, Anthony, and Edgar Awards. He conceived the idea for the Percy Jackson series as bedtime stories about ancient Greek heroes for his son Haley. Haley had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, inspiring Riordan to make the titular protagonist ADHD and dyslexic. Riordan published the first novel in the series, The Lightning Thief, in 2005. Four sequels followed, with the last, The Last Olympian, in 2009. Prior to Percy Jackson, Riordan had written the Tres Navarres series, a series of mystery novels for adult readers. His Percy Jackson and the Olympians series features the titular twelve-year-old who discovers he is the modern-day son of the ancient Greek god Poseidon. Twentieth Century Fox purchased the film rights and released a feature film in 2010. Following the success of Percy Jackson, Riordan created The Kane Chronicles, which features a modern-day Egyptian pantheon and two new sibling protagonists, Sadie and Carter Kane. Riordan also created a sequel series to Percy Jackson, The Heroes of Olympus. Riordan also helped create the children's book series The 39 Clues. He authored several of its books, including The Maze of Bones, which topped The New York Times Best Seller list on September 28, 2008. He also wrote the introduction to the Puffin Classics edition of Roger Lancelyn Green's Tales of the Greek Heroes, in which he states that the book influenced him to write his Greek mythology series.

The imprint is called \\"Rick Riordan Presents\\" and was launched in March 2018. It is headed by Riordan's editor, Stephanie Owens Lurie. Lurie said that Riordan had been approached about an imprint several years ago but initially dismissed the idea because of his heavy workload. Later, he reported back that he had been \\"toying with the idea\\" and was \\"willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience.\\" She also said that the imprint planned to launch with two then undetermined books. \\"The point of making this announcement now is to get the word out about what we‚Äôre looking for.‚Äù The imprint will not publish books written by Riordan, \\"whose role will be closer to curator\\". In an interview with the Iowa Gazette, Riordan said, \\"Instead of me writing all of the mythologies we are going to look for authors who already are writing about that stuff. If I feel like I can recommend them [to my readers] ... we‚Äôre going to have them out here in the spotlight.\\" A focus will be placed on \\"diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under- represented authors\\". Lurie expressed hopes that the imprint will help satisfy Riordan fans without asking the author to write more than his usual two books a year.

It was developed and built by Scangraphic, a division of Dr. B√∂ger Duplomat Apparate GmbH & Co.KG, based in Wedel near Hamburg, Germany. System The Scantext 1000 system comprised a CPU with multiple 8\\" disk drives, keyboard and monitor, the latter dispaying coordinates and codes defining a page layout. The left-hand drive was intended for recording document data; the second for required font data. In the early years, no preview was available, the operator seeing only typesetting codes (\\"working blind\\"). Later, a non-interactive (green) monochrome preview display was introduced. The Scantext 1000 system ran under the operating system CP/M and used Intel 8080/85 processors. The 1000 system also featured an optional font editing package, allowing not only modification of existing fonts but the creation of entirely new designs. This software displayed individual font characters for pixel-based editing, in conjunction with an attached stylus. An optional drum scanner facilitated the input of new designs to create new fonts or pi characters. To compensate for the lack of differently-sized master character images (as implemented in Monotype's Monophoto system, for instance), proportional scaling was implemented: the larger the type size specified, the tighter the spacing (an automatic feature). (For pi fonts and connecting scripts this was over-ridden by implementing a font number beginning with the figure 5, cancelling auto letterspacing.) The Scantext 1000 system was completed by a filmsetter unit using CRT technology. For the Scantext 2000 system a new hardware platform was defined. It made use of the Motorola 68000 processor series and 3.5\\" disk drives. The operating system was a Unix-derivate called OS-9. The workstation Scantext 2000 Commander featured a monochrome page preview display, plus additions to the page description language which allowed the creation of graphic primitives. The 2000 Commander also implemented the incorporation and display of bitmap images in conjunction with the optional flatbed scanner. The system was completed by the filmsetter unit, a drum-based laser imagesetter with a (then massive) 10Mb hard drive. Autotabs The Scantext system had some features which present-day typesetting software would do well to emulate: autotabs in particular were a feature ahead of their time. Scangraphic featured both horizontal and vertical tabs which could be defined as a percentage of page size, it therefore being possible to create layouts which reconfigured themselves to new page sizes. Vertical autotabs The Scantext system allowed a vertical autotab to be created at any point: at any ad hoc point in a column a command could be issued to close the current vertical tab; it was then possible, for instance, to type a command to box-in or to scribe vertical rules to fill the current working tab, even though its dimensions were unknown. Fonts Scantext Bodytypes were scanned with a video camera at a typical resolution of 512 lines. It is worth noting that, although font editing was pixel-based, character outlines were vectorized in software, thus allowing continuous scaling of any character up to 72 point / 18 mm cap height. For headline setting, Scangraphic introduced a separate range of headline fonts (marketed as Supertypes) with very tight spacing (as was the style at the time). The digital outlines of these fonts were originated by the digital type foundry URW in Ikarus Format and tailored by the Scangraphic type studio. The Supertype font format itself used short vectors (multiple edit points, a legacy of Ikarus encoding, as opposed to the more minimal PostScript vectorization technique). These fonts could be scaled up to a capital height of 90 mm. By 1991, Scangraphic had released its Supertype font library in Adobe‚Äôs PostScript Type1 font format for the Apple Macintosh. This range of designs is still available today. Barcodes The Scantext system possessed the then-unique capability to generate EAN/UPC-compliant barcodes in position on the imaged page. This was accomplished by the use of a proprietary EAN/UPC (5-numbered non-proportional) font which assigned elements of the upper and lower halves of the barcode to specific positions on the Scantext keyboard. The barcode was thus constructed in two parts (upper and lower), the operator being entirely responsible for ensuring that the correct bars were used in the correct position. This required knowledge of the three bar sets used in EAN/UPC encoding, the correct encoding sequence for each country and the computation of the required check digit.

Pihl (pronounced \\"peel\\") (born November 21, 1950) is a guitarist best known for playing with Sammy Hagar and his membership in the band Boston.\\"Boston: Musicians,\\" Bandboston.com/ Biography Gary Pihl was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he lived the first 12 years of his life. In 1963 his family relocated to San Mateo, California, where Pihl would become active in music and a participant in a number of local bands. Gary graduated from Hillsdale High School. At his home recording studio, Pihl worked with the founding members of a band that would eventually be called \\"Night Ranger.\\" They recorded demos for their first and second albums (Dawn Patrol and Midnight Madness, respectively) at his home studio. Night Ranger was initially called \\"Ranger,\\" but the band found that the name was already being used by another band and changed it prior to the first album release. He also played with several other bands including Day Blindness, Crossfire (Steve Jones, Mitchell Froom, David Froom, Phil Marshall with Jeff Dorenfeld as manager; Crossfire also performed with Norman Greenbaum as lead singer for several years.), Stark Raving Mad (Gary on lead vocals and guitar, Donovan Stark, Paul Taylor (later of Winger), Jay Causbrook, and David Payne, with Eric Martin of Mr. Big joining after Gary left, among other players), and Alliance. (Note: There have been several different bands named Alliance.) Crossfire featured an ARP Odyssey and ARP String Ensemble played by Mitchell Froom (who would later become known for the soundtrack to \\"La Bamba\\" and other films while also producing bands in LA). Crossfire's seminal moment was their performance at the Stop the Dam Concert held at Sonoma State College, (now Sonoma State University). The concert was to raise awareness and funds to stop the Army Corps of Engineers construction of the Lake Sonoma Dam project in Geyserville's Dry Creek Valley. Before leaving Stark Raving Mad to join Sammy Hagar, he was known for songs such as \\"Olga on the Volga.\\" Sammy Hagar was the opening act at the end of Boston's first tour in 1977 and opened the whole second tour in 1978/79. It was on those tours that Pihl met Tom Scholz. The two of them found out how much they had in common with their extensive home studios and techniques. It set up a lifelong bond and a few years later Tom asked Pihl to join Boston, after Hagar decided to join Van Halen. After Jeff Dorenfeld became manager for Boston, Pihl made other introductions including Doug Huffman, another drummer from Sebastopol in Sonoma County when Boston needed a replacement, and still later, bassist David Sikes from Fairfield, California near Sonoma County.

It allows the operator to pull the bolt to the rear. The cocking handle has a number of functions: it facilitates the ejection of a spent shell casing or unfired cartridge from the chamber; it loads a round from the magazine or by hand through the chamber; it clears a stoppage such as a jam, double feed, stovepipe or misfire; it verifies that the weapon's chamber is clear of any rounds or other obstructions; it moves the bolt in to battery, acting as a forward assist (but not necessarily); it releases a bolt locked to the rear, such as would be the case after firing the last round on a firearm equipped with a last-round-hold-open feature. Colt/Armalite - T-shaped charging handle below and behind the rear sight, with the forward assist below and to the right These devices vary significantly between firearms but may occur in the form of a small protrusion or hook from the side of the bolt, a pumped slide or lever. The slide in a pistol performs similar actions as a cocking handle. Charging handle (below the sight) on an L85A2 (SA80 family) There are also additional factors concerning the design of cocking handles, and some of them are especially important if the weapon is for tactical use. One issue is the mean time between failures due to metal fatigue. Just like other parts, cocking handles sometimes break when weapons are heavily used. Another issue is whether the cocking handle is sufficiently large for use by someone wearing heavy gloves and protective clothing. Some weapons are designed with thumb grooves for extra grip when cocking a weapon to prevent releasing it before it has been pulled back all the way, such as the British SA80 family of rifles. Cocking handles can be reciprocating or non- reciprocating. The advantage of the former is that it gives the user complete control over the movement of the bolt and bolt carrier, and it enables great force to be used to chamber or extract difficult or ruptured cartridges. However, it adds an extra, fast-moving part on the outside of the gun and may limit the way the gun is handled.

At Fifth Avenue, the street feeds into the 86th Street transverse, which runs east‚Äìwest through Central Park and heads from the Upper East Side (where it is known as East 85th Street) to West 86th Street on the Upper West Side. West 85th Street resumes one block south of the transverse's western end.85th Street, Manhattan, on Google Maps It includes landmarks such as the Lewis Gouverneur and Nathalie Bailey Morris House at 100 East 85th Street, the sidewalk clock at East 85th Street and Third Avenue, the Yorkville Bank Building at 201‚Äì203 East 85th Street, Red House at 350 West 85th Street, and Regis High School. History In 1837, the Board of Aldermen of New York City initially voted not to approve, but subsequently approved, the opening of East 85th Street between Third Avenue and Fifth Avenue, which the Committee on Roads and Canals had offered up as a resolution on the petition of owners of property on the street. In 1839, the Board of Aldermen approved the opening of West 85th Street between Fifth Avenue and Ninth Avenue. By the 1840s, a short length designated as West 85th Street had been created as a narrow lane east of Eighth Avenue. Most of West 85th Street was laid out following the American Civil War. However, until the 1880s the rate of development on the street was slow. At that time, following an improvement in public transportation, people began to speculate on the property on the street. In 1971, John Corry of the Times wrote a series of stories about life on West 85th Street between Central Park and Columbus Avenue. Transportation No New York City Subway stations are located on the street itself. Several are on nearby 86th Street, however: * 86th Street on the at Second Avenue * 86th Street on the at Lexington Avenue * 86th Street on the at Broadway * 86th Street on the at Central Park West Notable places and residents There are several significant landmarks on 85th Street. East Side Lewis Gouverneur and Nathalie Bailey Morris House The building at 100 East 85th Street, originally known as Lewis Gouverneur and Nathalie Bailey Morris House, is a large brick red townhouse that was built in 1913‚Äì14 in a neo-Federal style. Its architect was Ernest Flagg. It was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1973, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun (originally \\"Anshe Jeshurun\\"), a Modern Orthodox synagogue founded by Russian Jewish immigrants in 1872, is located at 125 East 85th Street, between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue, in a building built in 1902. The lower division of the Ramaz School, a coeducational, private Modern Orthodox Jewish prep school, shares a building with the congregation. The German American Bund, an American Nazi organization, had its national headquarters at 178 East 85th Street from 1936 through the early 1940s, and occasionally paraded in the neighborhood in Nazi uniforms. Sidewalk clock at East 85th Street and Third Avenue Park Lane Tower, the 35-story L-shaped high-rise apartment building shown in the opening credits of the television show The Jeffersons (1975-1985), is located at 185 East 85th Street and Third Avenue. Designed by architect Hyman Isaac Feldman and completed in 1967, the beige-brick structure features distinctive rounded balconies at its corners and angled balconies on its sides.Fodor's New York City 2009; Page 143, Fodor's Travel Publications (2008) The sidewalk clock at East 85th Street and Third Avenue, dating from the late 1800s and likely produced by E. Howard & Co., was designated a landmark in 1981. Constructed to resemble a pocket watch, it is high including its base. The Musical Mutual Protective Union At 201‚Äì203 East 85th Street, the Yorkville Bank Building (1905), a four-story building designed by Robert Maynicke, was designated a landmark in 2012. Instrument maker Vincent Bach manufactured trumpets and trumpet mouthpieces at 204 East 85th Street in the early 20th century. The building at 209 East 85th Street was constructed in 1919 aS the union hall of the Musical Mutual Protective Union. Minnie Marx and Sam Marx, the parents and manager of the Marx Brothers, lived at 330 East 85th Street. The clapboard shingle house at 412 East 85th Street was built around 1855. It was restored in 1988 by architect Alfredo De Vido. Author Henry Miller, who wrote Tropic of Cancer, was born in 1891 on the top floor of and lived at 450 East 85th Street. Author Louise Fitzhugh lived at 524 East 85th Street, between East End and York Avenues, and her heroine \\"Harriet\\" in Harriet the Spy lived in the area. The glassy Modernist building at 525 East 85th Street was built in 1958. Its architect was Paul Mitarachi. Central Park The 86th Street transverse cuts through Central Park, and is directly below the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. In the early 1880s, most of the cross-town traffic in the area traveled on it. In 1917, New York Railways ran across the traverse road on 85th Street, from Eighth Avenue through Central Park to Madison Avenue. Southwest Reservoir Bridge Southwest Reservoir Bridge, at 85th Street in Central Park, was designed by Calvert Vaux and is decorated with elegant iron floral scroll ornamentation along its of railings and spandrels. Map of Seneca Village (Egbert Viele, circa 1857) The site of Seneca Village is in Central Park near West 85th Street. The three lots on which the village was established were purchased in 1825 by Andrew Williams for $125 ($ in current dollar terms), and sold by him to the City of New York three decades later for $2,335 ($ in current dollar terms). In the mid-19th century it was a shanty-town, and it may have been populated by free blacks in the early 1800s. The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church was at this location. The Spector Playground is located in Central Park near West 85th Street. Mariners' Gate is at Central Park and West 85th Street, at an entrance to the park. The name for the gate was chosen as reflecting one of the types of people it was expected would be enjoying the park, at the time the park was built. West Side Mannes College of Music Rossleigh Court at 1 West 85th Street, constructed between 1906 and 1907, was designed by Mulliken and Moeller and built by Gotham Building and Construction.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Upper West Side/ Central Park West District Designation Report, Vol. I: Essay/ Architects' Appendix, April 24, 1990. It followed the popular \\"French Flat\\" model in a Beaux-Arts style. Novelist Ellen Glasgow lived in the building for a few months every year in the early 20th century. 44 West 85th Street was the location of the Nippon Club of New York City, a private social club founded in 1905 by J≈çkichi Takamine for Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals, in the early 20th century. Red House At 140 West 85th Street, a Dawn Redwood (metasequoia glyptostroboides) endangered coniferous tree can be seen. Mannes College of Music is a music school located at 150 West 85th Street, which moved there in 1984 seeking larger quarters. 329, 331, 333, 335, and 337 West 85th Street were built in 1890‚Äì91. They are brownstone and brick Queen Anne-Romanesque Revival architecture. Journalist Heywood Broun and feminist Ruth Hale lived at 333 West 85th Street. On the corner of West 85th Street and West End Avenue, a Japanese Maple (acer palmatum) species of woody plant can be seen. Red House at 350 West 85th Street, between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive, was built in 1903‚Äì04, and the six-story French Renaissance/Gothic building was designated a landmark in 1982. It was one of the first apartment buildings in the area, supplanting the earlier row houses. Writer Dorothy Parker lived here at one time.

When a gamma-ray scatters off the scintillator but escapes, only some fraction of its energy is registered by the detector. The amount of energy deposited in the detector depends on the scattering angle of the photon, leading to a spectrum of energies each corresponding to a different scattering angle. The highest energy that can be deposited, corresponding to full back-scatter, is called the Compton edge. Background Gamma-spectrum of a radioactive Am-Be-source. The photopeak after the Compton edge corresponds to detection of the incident gamma rays. The significantly lower count in the region between the Compton edge and the photopeak reflects the fact that no gamma rays of this energy can be absorbed by the detector. In a Compton scattering process, an incident photon collides with an electron in a material. The amount of energy exchanged varies with angle, and is given by the formula: : \\\\frac{1}{E^\\\\prime} - \\\\frac{1}{E} = \\\\frac{1}{m_{\\\\text{e}} c^2}\\\\left(1-\\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\right) or : E^\\\\prime = \\\\frac{E}{1 + \\\\frac{E}{m_{\\\\text{e}} c^2}(1-\\\\cos\\\\theta)} Knoll, Glenn F.

It owns and operates six community newspapers in the Winnipeg area. Five of those newspapers, The Lance, The Metro, The Herald, The Headliner and The Times began as local area papers as early as 1917. Over the course of years, they became part of the Transcontinental Media newspaper company. In 2004, Canstar was sold by Transcontinental to FP Canadian Newspapers, owners of the Winnipeg Free Press. Included in the deal were flyer distribution operations in Brandon and Thunder Bay. In 2009, the Lance was divided into two community newspapers to better cover the expanding and developing Winnipeg South area, and The Sou'wester was born. The two niche publications, Uptown Magazine, an alternative news-and-entertainment weekly, and The Prime Times, a seniors' paper, were purchased from Rosebud Communications in 2005. The Prime Times ceased publication in November 2011 and Canstar and FP Canadian Newspapers launched a bi-monthly magazine, Winnipeg Boomer, on Nov. 26, 2011. Winnipeg Boomer ceased publication with its October 2012 issue and Uptown Magazine ceased publication as a standalone weekly newspaper on Oct. 25, 2012. It was relaunched as a section of the Thursday edition of the Winnipeg Free Press on Nov. 1, 2012. In 2007, the newspapers' website, www.weeklies.ca, won first place, for best website in class, at the Canadian Community Newspaper Association (CCNA) awards. That website no longer exists, as the papers are now accessed through a new URL, canstarnews.com, or via the Winnipeg Free Press website.

The highway starts at US Highway 12 (US 12) southwest of Niles and runs through rural areas of the county to terminate at an intersection with Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) in Benton Harbor. The highway runs parallel to the St. Joseph River, crossing the river several times as it follows a set of roads previously used for US 31 in the area. The highway was first designated in the 1930s as a bypass of the Benton Harbor and St. Joseph area. Its termini have been moved over the years since, extending and contracting the length of the highway between Niles and Benton Harbor. M-139 now serves to provide access through the area from a set of bypasses consisting of I-94 and US 31\\\\. Route description M-139 begins at a junction with US 12 southwest of Niles in Bertrand Township. The highway travels northeasterly along Chicago Road through farm fields and residential neighborhoods. The trunkline turns north along Lincoln Avenue and then east on Main Street to run into downtown Niles. Main Street crosses the St. Joseph River, and at the intersection with Front Street, M-139 turns north along that street which is also called \\"OLD US 31\\" on some maps. The highway runs parallel to the river as both exit the downtown area. M-139 turns toward the northwest on the outskirts of town, running through farm fields. The trunkline passes Webster and Long lakes as it crosses mixed forest and residential areas between Niles and Berrien Springs. M-139 in Fair Plain, near Benton Harbor Entering Berrien Springs, M-139 curves around part of Lake Chapin. North of the dam that forms Lake Chapin from the St. Joseph River, the highway follows Ferry Street to the southwest to cross the river. In downtown Berrien Springs, the trunkline then turns northwesterly along St. Joseph Avenue to pass Andrews University. Northwest of the college, M-139 crosses US 31 (St. Joseph Valley Parkway). From there the highway travels northwesterly through Royalton Township through farm fields parallel to the St. Joseph River. M-139 follows Niles Road to the community of Scottdale where it turns northward along Scottdale Road at an intersection with M-63. M-139 crosses the St. Joseph River one last time south of the interchange with I-94 at its exit 28; M-139 then passes through the community of Fair Plain and enters the eastern edge of Benton Harbor. Before terminating at BL I-94 (Main Street) in Benton Harbor, the highway splits into a one-way pair just north of Empire Avenue. Northbound traffic is routed along Martin Luther King Drive while southbound traffic flows on Fair Avenue. M-139 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2011 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-139 were the 12,248 vehicles daily between the intersections with Fairland and Deans Hill/Pokagon roads south of Berrien Springs; the lowest counts were the 1,576 vehicles per day in downtown Niles. The only section of M-139 that have been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) is from the interchange with US 31 northward. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History M-139 was designated as a state trunkline by 1931 from US 31 at Scottdale to US 12 in Benton Harbor. In late 1953 or early 1954 M-139 was extended westward along US 12 and then northward along Paw Paw Avenue to meet a new bypass routing of US 31 north of Benton Harbor. US 31 was rerouted to follow what is now the I-196 freeway in 1963. At that time, US 31 was then routed along I-94 and M-139 to Scottdale. The following year, the concurrency was removed when M-139 was truncated to end at I-94/US 31. The northern extension on Paw Paw Avenue was turned back to local control, truncating the northern end of M-139 to the intersection with BL I-94 (previously US 12). On August 27, 2003, the St. Joseph Valley Parkway freeway carrying US 31 was completed from northwest of Berrien Springs (exit 15) to Napier Avenue near Benton Harbor (exit 24). The former section of M-139 replaced by US 31 was once again designated M-139, with M-139 extending further along the former US 31 to the freeway's exit 15. In 2008, M-139 was planned to extend southerly to end at Main Street (Business US 12, Bus. US 12) in Niles along the unsigned state trunkline OLD US 31 and Bus. US 31, but after the City of Niles announced its plan to take over maintenance of the section of East Main Street between Front Street/Bus. US 31 and Fifth Street/M-51 in order to ban trucks, the plan was revised to extend M-139 further south, replacing the Bus. US 12 designation southwesterly to US 12\\\\. The extension was executed on March 5, 2010, prior to route marker installation.

Premise Pop and rock music was featured in this series for youth, essentially a Canadian version of American Bandstand. Production The first season (1963‚Äì1964) was a Toronto production with host Alex Trebek who welcomed visiting musicians and introduced songs from the house musicians before a studio audience of dancing teenagers. He was replaced in following seasons by Dave Mickie, a disc jockey for CKEY in that time. Series musicians were Norm Amadio and the Rhythm Rockers, joined by The Girlfriends who were a female vocal trio. The producer of this season was Stan Jacobson. The second season's schedule expanded to all weekdays with other Canadian cities contributing to the production of Music Hop: * Mondays: Let's Go originated from Vancouver with producer Ain Soodor * Tuesdays: Jeunesse Oblige originated from Montreal with producer Pierre Desjardins * Wednesdays: Hootenanny originated from Winnipeg with host Ray St. Germain (Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame Inductee) with producer Ray McConnell * Thursdays: Music Hop originated from Toronto with producer Allan Angus * Fridays: Frank's Bandstand originated from Halifax with producer Manny Pitson Scheduling The first season of this half-hour series was broadcast Thursdays at 5:30 p.m. (Eastern) from its debut 3 October 1963. In the following two seasons, it was seen every weekday, also at 5:30 p.m., since 28 September 1964. In its final season, the Friday episode was omitted from 3 October 1966 until its final broadcast on 28 June 1967. Reception Music Hop attracted approximately one million weekly viewers according to CBC estimates, mostly under age 20, with an estimated one-third of those viewers adults.

The line runs from Washington, D.C., northwest to Weverton, Maryland, along the former Metropolitan Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.CSX Transportation. \\"Northern Region, Baltimore Division, Timetable No. 4.\\" Effective 2005-01-01. http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/ME- Metropolitan_Sub At its southeast end, north of Union Station, the Metropolitan Subdivision meets the Capital Subdivision (formerly called the B&O; Washington Branch) and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. It meets the Old Main Line Subdivision at Point of Rocks, Maryland. At its northwest end in Weverton, the line joins the Cumberland Subdivision. MARC Train's Brunswick Line uses the entire subdivision, as does Amtrak's Capitol Limited. The Red Line of the Washington Metro shares right-of-way with the subdivision along two separate stretches in Maryland and D.C.: from the junction with the Capital Subdivision to north of Silver Spring, and from south of Twinbrook to the end of the Red Line at Shady Grove. History Interest in building a new rail line from Washington to points west was initially generated by businessmen in Washington and Montgomery County, Maryland. In 1853 they obtained a corporate charter from the Maryland General Assembly to form the Metropolitan Railroad. The proposed line would run from Washington to the vicinity of Frederick, Maryland, where it would connect with the B&O; main line, and continue to Hagerstown, Maryland. The company conducted some initial land surveys, but had difficulty raising funds and went bankrupt in 1863. Previously the B&O; had not been interested in building a new route out of Washington, but following the Metropolitan Railroad's failure, it took over the expired charter in 1865. Construction began in 1866 along a slightly different route, connecting with the main line at Point of Rocks, Maryland. The line opened in 1873 as the B&O;'s Metropolitan Branch. Upon the opening of the branch on April 30, 1873, the B&O; rerouted its through passenger traffic through Washington, and the Old Main Line, from Point of Rocks to Relay, was reduced to secondary status as far as passenger service was concerned. Some through freight trains were also rerouted to use the new line. , February 2004 Edition Due to increasing congestion, the B&O; began to add double track portions to the line in 1886. The Washington-to-Gaithersburg section was double-tracked by 1893. During the peak years of passenger operation, 1893 to the 1920s, there were eighteen trains per day, with as many as 28 stops along the Met Branch. Significant engineering features include bridges across: *Tuscarora Creek. Originally a Bollman truss iron bridge, replaced with a girder bridge in 1904. *Monocacy River. Originally a Bollman truss, replaced with a seven-span girder bridge in 1904. *Little Monocacy River. Originally a 500-foot wood trestle, replaced by a 331-foot stone arch viaduct in 1906. *Great Seneca Creek (Waring Viaduct). Originally a wood and iron trestle, replaced with an arch stone viaduct in 1906. *Little Seneca Creek. Originally a timber bridge, replaced with a steel trestle in 1896, and then a concrete arch in 1928. *Rock Creek. Originally four 100-ft Bollman trusses, it was replaced by a stone arch bridge in 1896. Double-tracking was completed on the remainder of the branch in 1928. Several distinctive passenger stations, designed by architect Ephraim Francis Baldwin, were constructed along the line. Original stations still stand at Rockville (moved away from the tracks in 1981), Kensington, Gaithersburg, Dickerson, and Point of Rocks. In 1906, a rear collision at Terra Cotta station killed 53 people. Georgetown Branch The Georgetown Branch ran from a junction north of the Silver Spring station to the Georgetown area of Washington, D.C. The branch was built between 1892 and 1910. It was originally intended to be a B&O; extension that would cross the Potomac River near the Chain Bridge. In 1904 the B&O; reached agreement with the Pennsylvania Railroad to access the nearby Long Bridge over the Potomac, and then proceeded to use the Georgetown Branch as a spur servicing local industries in Silver Spring, Chevy Chase, Bethesda and Georgetown. Significant engineering features that were built on the branch included the Rock Creek Trestle in Chevy Chase, the Dalecarlia Tunnel and a through-truss bridge over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. CSX abandoned the Georgetown Branch in 1986, with the last train running in June 1985, and the spur is now accessible to the public as the Capital Crescent Trail. The Bethesda-to-Silver Spring portion of the spur is also providing a right-of-way for the Purple Line light rail system, which has been under construction since 2017. The existing Rock Creek trestle was demolished and is being replaced by new bridges to support the light rail tracks and the bicycle trail. Current operation Freight train at Derwood interlocking heading east towards Washington, D.C. Through mergers, the line became part of the CSX system in 1987. CSX organized its Metropolitan Subdivision as a combination of the original B&O; Met Branch plus a section of the B&O; original main line northwest of Point of Rocks, which had opened in 1834. The entire subdivision is signaled for bi-directional running. There is a spur that services the Dickerson Generating Station (formerly owned by the Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO)) at Dickerson, and a trash-transfer facility spur at Derwood. The interlockings on the line are (east to west): F Tower, QN Tower, Georgetown Jct, Montrose, Derwood, Cloppers, Buck Lodge, Dickerson, PEPCO, Tuscarora, East Rocks, Point of Rocks, East Brunswick, WB Tower and Weverton.

In 2002, it was the tallest Christmas tree in the Los Angeles area and attracted about 90,000 visitors a day during the holiday season. History The tradition of lighting The Grove Christmas Tree takes place in mid-November after it was begun in 2002 by real estate developer and businessman Rick J. Caruso. He aimed to make the tree the centerpiece of his retail and entertainment complex, The Grove in Los Angeles, during the Christmas season. In time, the popularity of the annual lighting ceremony eventually rivaled that of the famed Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree lighting mid-town Manhattan, New York. The Grove Christmas Tree measures 100 to 110 feet while the Rockefeller Center tree is only about 75 to 90 feet. The first white fir tree used for the event was harvested from the Mount Shasta region in Northern California in 2010. The following year, a 100-foot white fir was decorated with more than 10,000 lights and 15,000 ornaments, setting the precedent for successive Christmas trees for The Grove at Farmers Market. Tree Lighting Among the performers who have graced the event are operatic acts Il Divo and Jackie Evancho, pop singers The Backstreet Boys, Michael Bolton, Far East Movement, Colbie Caillat, Sean Kingston, Gavin DeGraw, and Robin Thicke as well as American Idol alumni Lauren Alaina, Scotty McCreery, and Phillip Phillips. Caruso‚Äôs Top Hats Dancers Rachel Montez Collins and Kathryn Burns have also showcased their famous act. Actor and celebrity insider Mario Lopez hosts the annual celebration. For the 10th anniversary of the Christmas tree lighting, The Grove partnered with the Make- A-Wish Foundation for its ‚ÄúSeason of Wishes‚Äù campaign. Christmas lights and baubles covered the white fir tree as well as everything else at The Grove. The evening showcased artificial snowfall, bubbles, and a fireworks finale. KCBS-TV, the Los Angeles area affiliate (and West Coast flagship station) of CBS, televises The Grove Christmas Tree lighting live every year.

It is the sixth entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot Set in medieval times, the father of the Stooges informs him from his deathbed that they are of royal blood. Now dubbed the Duke of Durham (Larry), the Count of Fife (Moe) and Baron of Grey Matter (Curly), they are entrusted by their father to take up arms and protect Queen Anne (Geneva Mitchell) of their old kingdom of Anesthesia, as word has spread that the present prime minister, Prince Boris (George Baxter), may attempt to seize the throne. The Stooges accept and make their way to Anesthesia, where, as the Duke of Mixture, the Fife of Drum and Baron of Brains, they become the queen's royal guards. The prince puts in motion his plan to abduct the queen as a royal wrestling match starts. Disgusted by the result of the match, Moe and Curly take it upon themselves to wrestle in their place with Larry acting as the referee. After an unforgettable match, the queen ends up missing, with the Stooges blamed for being lax. A sword fight ensues and the Stooges are taken away to be executed. The Stooges are sentenced to be shot by crossbows, but before the arrows are fired the archers spot a woman undressing at a window. Enchanted, they watch her, giving the Stooges a chance to escape. As they hide out from the guards someone drops a jug on Curly's head. It contains a note stating that the queen is hidden in the wine cellar. The Stooges head to the cellar, spotting a few of the men who had taken the queen, and come up with a plan‚ÄîCurly will lure them out one by one, and Moe and Larry will knock them out. The plan goes well until one guard trips while chasing Curly and Moe and Larry inadvertently knock themselves out. Curly takes off with the guard hot on his trail, until Curly sneaks up behind him and knocks him out. He then runs back to the alcove, where Moe and Larry regain consciousness just in time to hear footsteps. Thinking them to be of the guard they missed, they swing their clubs and knock Curly out instead. The queen, tied up and hidden away, is able to loosen the gag on her mouth and call for help. The Stooges rush to her rescue, but a few more guards show up to search the wine cellar for them. Moe instructs Curly to do the same tactic he did before, but as he and Larry take position and Curly dashes past the doorway, the queen follows him, unaware of their plan, and is accidentally knocked out. Once they realize what they have done, all three Stooges hit themselves on the head, knocking each other out.

Born in Glasgow, McLennan worked as an engineering draughtsperson before taking on various full-time posts within the CPGB. He contested the Glasgow Govan constituency at the 1959 general election, then the 1962 West Lothian by-election; Glasgow Govan again at the 1966 general election. He became the National Organiser of the CPGB in 1966, and while holding this post, contested elections in St Pancras North at the 1970 and February 1974 general elections. In 1975, McLennan was elected as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He held the post while the party was in terminal decline, with factional infighting within the CPGB, finally stepping down in 1989. One of his acts at General Secretary was to appoint Martin Jacques, then an academic at the University of Bristol, as editor of Marxism Today in 1977. After the dissolution of the party, in 1991, he joined the Communist Party of Scotland. He remained active in the pensioners' movement and supported the Respect ‚Äì The Unity Coalition candidate George Galloway at the 2005 general election. He also maintained contact with the Alliance for Green Socialism, one of the successor bodies to the CPGB (via the Green Socialist Network) but although he addressed AGS meetings and wrote for the AGS journal (Green Socialist) he never joined this organisation.

The website sought to call attention to what it alleged to be systemic societal corruption in the CNMI. It was in existence between 2001 and September 2014, and was reported on in a variety of ways in local, regional, and international newsprint and magazine outlets, on ABC Radio Australia, and Internet forums and blogs. The website was the subject of intense debate and scrutiny by the CNMI government, which threatened to sue the website's author. In contrast, the site's author is celebrated in the 2012 novel The Master Blaster by writer and former Saipan Peace Corps Volunteer P. F. Kluge.  Content  Image of one of the dozens of variants of the Saipan Sucks logo. Other versions contain different sayings under the main caption \\"Welcome to Saipan\\". The website also makes available for purchase t-shirts and other paraphernalia featuring the logo and above saying. Saipan Sucks seeks to call attention to what it alleges to be systemic societal problems in the CNMI that are supported by misuse of United States taxpayer money. Press outlets have quoted the following excerpt from the website: > Nepotism rules on the islands. Fueled by money paid by American taxpayers > and diverted to the far-off territory, politicians run for office primarily > for the sake of being in a position to appoint their relatives to high- > paying sinecures. The website presents allegations of corruption, racism, nepotism, jury- rigging, worker exploitation, employment discrimination, and mismanagement of the CNMI tourism industry by local CNMI officials, and seeks to warn U.S. mainlanders about moving to the islands to accept employment offers.  Criticism  Since July 2001, shortly after Saipan Sucks was created, CNMI government officials criticized the website's anonymity and characterized it as a \\"smear campaign\\". Stemming from its reported investigations, the CNMI government has threatened to sue the website's author for libel or defamation. The website author's response to the CNMI government was to state that they have \\"apparently never heard of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution ‚Ä¶ Is it possible the investigators don't recognize political and social commentary when they see it?\\" In November 2006, a local environmental group, Beautify CNMI!, decried the website's high PageRank in search engines such as Google, and the fact that anyone who searches with the keyword \\"Saipan\\" could find the website in the top-ten search result positions. The group published a plan to counter the website's ranking through a campaign of linkspamming via Google bombing and text anchoring. Villagomez is Restoration Chairman of Beautify CNMI! All along, counter-critics who are either Chamorros (indigenous people of Saipan) or those otherwise knowledgeable about the CNMI have maintained that, although Saipan Sucks uses hyperbole as a literary device, much or most of what it states is true and should be heeded.  Author  Saipan Sucks was written by a person or persons going by the pseudonym \\"Forgetabilia\\". Reported investigations carried out by the CNMI government in July 2001 led to an alleged belief about a real identity behind this persona. Later, on November 16, 2006, a CNMI daily alleged that Saipan Sucks was written by a former CNMI Assistant Attorney General, who the daily reported as having \\"disliked his position\\" in the CNMI. The same day, a regional publication denied the claim, reiterating that the author or authors remain anonymous. Saipan Sucks closes by stating, \\"As for the authors of this essay, our days in Micronesia have ended ‚Ä¶ In all likelihood we shall remain happily for the rest of our days ensconced in anonymous Longnesia, suffering, with a little luck, from a selective am-nesia.

It was founded by Anthony J. Scotti, Ben Scotti, and Syd Vinnedge. The company was known for producing and distributing television shows such as Baywatch, America's Top 10, and the Mark Goodson Productions library of game shows. History All American's roots trace back to 1967 where Anthony J. Scotti was a fledgling actor who was famous for playing \\"Tony Polar\\" in the movie Valley of the Dolls. After that, Scotti found his life as an actor boring. He told Forbes magazine, \\"I had come to the conclusion that acting was the most boring God-awful thing a human being could do.\\" He then quit his acting career in 1971 to pursue a career in music. At the time, he was named senior vice president of MGM's record division. Three years later, he teamed up with his brother Ben to create Scotti Brothers Records, a music marketing company that produced the success of artists such as Electric Light Orchestra, Survivor, and \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. In 1979, the Scotti Brothers entered the television business by producing the pop music show America's Top 10, hosted by popular radio DJ Casey Kasem. Two years later, the show's popularity led the Scotti Brothers and Syd Vinnedge, a veteran of TV and radio advertising, to found New York-based All American Television. The new company was named after Anthony Scotti's success as a football player in high school. In 1982, All American hired George Back, the founder of a small television syndicator in New York who brought Joe Kovacs with him into the company. In 1985, All American went public and began trading as a pink sheet on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Later, the company joined the New York Stock Exchange. 1990s In late 1990, All American paved the way for success when it acquired the first-run syndication rights to Baywatch (a fledgling beach drama series that NBC canceled at the time) through LBS Communications. The move paid off and Baywatch went on to become one of the most popular TV shows until its cancellation in 2001. In 1991, All American and Scotti Brothers Entertainment Industries merged in a stock swap that created the television and music recording core of what would eventually become All American Communications. Anthony Scotti became CEO of the combined entity, and in January 1991 he hired Myron Roth, a former MCA Records and CBS Records executive, to become the company's new president and COO. Syd Vinnedge was named senior executive vice president and Ben Scotti became executive vice president of the records division. All American was represented by Howard L. Mann of Schwartzman, Weinstock, Garelick & Mann, P.C. The Scotti Brothers Records label distributed its music through BMG Music from 1990 to 1996. The company then acquired the assets of its Baywatch distribution partner, Lexington Broadcast Services Company (LBS), which at the time had declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. By October 1991, All American announced its long-awaited merger with LBS, and Anthony Scotti decided to name LBS founder Henry Siegel as All American's new president. Henry Siegel's brother Paul Siegel was named the company's new president of international and ancillary markets. The distribution rights of Baywatch and Family Feud reverted to All American in the agreement. By late 1992, All American's first attempt to clone the success of Baywatch‚Äîan action series Acapulco H.E.A.T.‚Äîhad been sold to half of the United States independent television market. In December 1993, All American's Scotti Brothers Records subsidiary created a new urban rap division called Street Life Records which showcased African-American urban acts such as Skee-Lo, The Comrads, and Craig Mack. In 1994, All American found itself once again fighting its image as a \\"one-show wonder\\" when it was forced to cancel Acapulco H.E.A.T. after half a season and police drama Sirens after one season on the air. In July 1994, despite rumors that Henry and Paul Siegel were fired due to their dissatisfaction with the cancellation of Acapulco H.E.A.T., All American acquired interest in worldwide game show production company Fremantle International (not to be confused with the current incarnation of Fremantle where the rights to the original Fremantle and All American library stand today) from Interpublic Group of Companies. In exchange for a 20% stake in All American, Interpublic gave All American some of the programming rights to Fremantle International's 93 game shows, which included local language versions of popular American game shows, such as The Price is Right and Family Feud (All American syndicated Feud in the U.S. at the time), all highly popular in their foreign markets. A month later, former Fremantle chairman Larry Lamattina replaced Henry Siegel as the new president and CEO of All American Television. In October 1995, All American acquired 50% of the assets and library of Mark Goodson Productions, the producers of classic game shows including The Price is Right and Family Feud, which the company acquired the foreign distribution rights through Fremantle International. In March 1996, Scotti Bros. Records, which had released some 142 albums since 1982, was officially renamed All American Music Group and announced a distribution deal with Warner Music Group that promised to increase its penetration of the pop music market. A month later, All American acquired the remaining 50% of Mark Goodson Productions from Interpublic, giving All American total ownership of the Goodson library of game shows. Two months later, All American purchased international talk show producer and distributor Orbis Entertainment Company (not to be confused with now-defunct TV syndicator Orbis Communications, although both companies were created by the same two founders Robert Turner and Ethan Podell),\\"AP News Archive\\" Multimedia Buys Television Programming Assets apnewsarchive.com, Retrieved on October 19, 2013 which was renamed All American/Orbis Communications. The acquisition significantly bolstered All American's shift into international television production and distribution and led to All American's second domestic attempt into the talk genre in the fall of 1997 with Arthel and Fred. Its first attempt, The Richard Bey Show, which originated as a local talk show at WWOR-TV in Secaucus, NJ, was cancelled in November 1996. All-American had also distributed a show featuring popular radio shock jock Howard Stern from 1990-92 that originated at WWOR, called simply The Howard Stern Show. In July 1996, All American formed an in-house licensing and merchandising division to increase control of Baywatch and other merchandise lines. By 1997, the record label was sold to Zomba Music Group's Volcano Records. Meanwhile, All American was sold to Pearson plc's Pearson Television subsidiary, and All American became Pearson Television's U.S. division. When Pearson Television merged with CLT-UFA to form the RTL Group in 2000, Pearson TV became the content production arm of the new group, then changed its name to FremantleMedia the next year, and eventually in 2018 renamed into Fremantle, thus reviving the name of that acquired companies. Current status of the All American libraries Today, the current incarnation of Fremantle (formerly FremantleMedia) holds the rights to the All American and LBS libraries, as well as the old Fremantle International library of game shows, and the Orbis Entertainment library of talk shows. Vinnedge remained with the company for several years after, including replacing Bob Barker as executive producer of The Price Is Right for the first several years after Barker's retirement in 2007; he has since retired.

Concept The road would provide a second access route off the Whangaparaoa Peninsula, and is claimed by some to be needed to unlock large amounts of commercial land, contribute up to $173 million to GDP during its construction, and create employment estimated at more than 5000 jobs. The project's planning was originally being undertaken by Rodney District Council, Auckland Regional Council, and Transit New Zealand before 2010. With the creation of the Auckland Supercity on 1 November 2010, the project now sits with Auckland Council and its transport entity Auckland Transport. Penlink would be approximately 7 km long and connect Whangaparaoa Peninsula with State Highway 1 at Redvale, effectively connecting the urban area of Hibiscus Coast and Bays, which runs from Waiwera south down the eastern coastline to Campbells Bay. The potential growth of the region is hampered by the Silverdale Motorway Interchange which is the traffic pinch point. Penlink addresses this and will include other modes such as public transport, walking and cycling. Initially proposed as a toll road, it was later envisaged that it would be paid for by a part of the income from a regional fuel tax; but in 2018 was again changed to the toll option. Status * All the land has been designated and property purchased. * Auckland Council owns the project and ratepayers will be reimbursed all costs to date. * Auckland Council will fund the Project, to be started in 2021.

History Auguste Rodin's The Thinker near the entrance of the National Museum of Western Art. The NMWA was established on June 10, 1959. The museum developed around the core art collection of Matsukata Kojiro (1865‚Äì1950), whose thinking is mirrored in the museum he anticipated. Matsukata's acquisition strategies were designed to create the nucleus of what he hoped would become an evolving national museum specializing in Western art. NMWA collection The museum exhibits works from the Renaissance to the early 20th century, many having been acquired since the museum's opening. The museum's purpose is to provide the public with opportunities to appreciate Western art.NMWA outline Since its opening, the museum, as Japan's only national institution devoted to Western art, has been involved in exhibitions, art work and document acquisition, research, restoration and conservation, education and the publication of materials related to Western art.  Exhibitions  The museum is involved in the development and organization of a special exhibition every year. These exhibitions feature works on loan from private collections and museums both in and out of Japan. In 1963, NMWA created a splash on the international art scene by bringing together 450 works by Marc Chagall. The exhibition brought together Chagall's work from 15 countries, including 8 paintings lent from the Soviet Union; and it was believed to be the most comprehensive show mounted during the artist's lifetime.Chapin, Emerson. \\"Japan Assembling a Large Chagall Show; 450 Works From 15 Nations to Be Lent For Tokyo Display; Value of Exhibition Estimated at Nearly $14 Million Planned for 7 Years Designed by Le Corbusler,\\" New York Times. September 24, 1963. In January 2019, it was announced that the National Gallery, London will loan over 60 paintings for a two-venue tour of the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo and the National Museum of Art, Osaka in 2020, the year of the Tokyo Olympics. Included within the loaned collection will be Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers, which will travel to Japan for the first time. Collections Claude Monet, Water Lilies, 1916, oil on canvas, 200.5 √ó 201 cm (78.9 √ó 79.1 in) NMWA has purchased art work every year since its establishment in its efforts to build and develop its permanent collection. The museum houses about 4,500 works, including examples of painting and sculpture from the 14th through the beginning of the 20th century. The museum's holdings have expanded in the decades since the museum was first opened to the public: Paintings; 18th century and earlier The Main Building displays pre-18th-century paintings, including those by Veronese,NMWA 14th-16th centuries Rubens, NMWA 17th century Brueghel, and Fragonard. NMWA 18th century Many of these paintings are religious paintings featuring imagery from Christianity. Paintings: 19th-20th century The New Wing displays 19th- to early 20th-century French paintings, including works by Delacroix, Courbet, Manet, Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Moreau. NMWA pre-WWII artists The galleries also feature works by the next generation of artists, such as Marquet, Picasso, Soutin, Ernst, Mir√≥, Dubuffet and Pollock. NMWA post-WWII artists Drawings The NMWA drawing collection centers on works by such 18th- to 19th-century French artists as Boucher, Fragonard, Delacroix, Moreau, Rodin, and C√©zanne. Prints The prints collection features works by D√ºrer, Holbein, Rembrandt, Callot, Piranesi, Goya, and Klinger, ranging from the 15th century through the early 20th century. NMWA prints study Union catalog The \\"Union Catalog of the Collections of the National Art Museums, Japan\\" is a consolidated catalog of material held by the four Japanese national art museums: IAI-National Museums of Art union catalog * The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto (MOMAK).

Le Corbusier's building National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo. One of the examples of architecture by Le Corbusier The Main Building was designed by the Swiss architect Charles-Edouard Jeanneret-Gris (1887‚Äì1965), who is more popularly known as Le Corbusier. It is the only representative example of his work in the Far East;Watanabe, Hiroshi. (2001). The Architecture of Tokyo: An Architectural History, pp. 123-124. and the New York Times review of its opening suggested that the building itself presented an \\"artistic significance and beauty\\" which rivaled the paintings inside.Falk, Ray. \\"French Art in Tokyo,\\" New York Times. June 21, 1959. The multi-story, reinforced concrete building was completed in March 1959 as a symbol of the resumption of diplomatic ties between Japan and France after World War II. NMWA building History of the commission The museum was built to house the collection of works gathered by the industrialist Matsukata Kojiro between 1920 and 1923. His collection had remained in England and France until after World War II when the Japanese Government asked France for its return to Japan. After France stipulated that a French architect should design the museum that would house the collection, the works were returned to Japan. Le Corbusier was selected for this task.Reynolds, (2001), p177 Le Corbusier designed a masterplan to include the area surrounding the museum. The design itself evolved into a building far exceeding the original brief and the library, a small lecture hall and a room for distinguished guests had to be removed. Nonetheless the removed elements were retained on the plans to provide guidance for future extension.Sakakura, (1959), p36 Japanese contribution Le Corbusier asked that his three Japanese apprentices: Kunio Maekawa, Junzo Sakakura and Takamasa Yoshizaka be responsible for developing the detail drawings and supervising the construction. Building The museum is square in plan with the main body of the galleries raised on piloti to first floor level. The layout is influenced by Le Corbusier's Sanskar Kendra museum in Ahmedabad which was being designed at the same time.Reynolds, (2001), p178 Entrance for visitors is at ground floor level via the 19th Century Hall. This double height space is lit from above with a north glazed pyramidal skylight intersected with reinforced concrete beams and a column. On the opposite side of the hall from the entrance, the ascent to the paintings gallery is via a promenade ramp which affords better views of Rodin's sculptures. The paintings gallery wraps around 19th Century Hall, the ceiling is initially low but is raised to two storeys around the perimeter to display the paintings. There are also balconies at this level that push back into the 19th Century Hall to re-orient the visitor. Le Corbusier designed the paintings gallery to be lit by natural daylight via four lighting troughs,Sakakura, (1959), p44 but these are no longer used and the galleries are now artificially lit.\\"Discover Architecture Map\\", The National Museum of Western Art Externally the building is clad in prefabricated concrete panels which sit on U-shaped frames supported by the inner wall. The building generally is constructed of reinforced concrete and the columns have a smooth concrete finish. After more than two years of construction the building opened on 10 June 1959. Modulor In every element of the building Le Corbusier's Modulor has been applied: > \\"The modular, which Le Corbusier developed after many years of research, is > like a musical scale which gives order to the infinitude of possible musical > pitches. Based on the size and proportions of the human body, it is a means > of fitting architecture to the human spirit, of ordering the infinitude of > possible proportions in such a way as to make them conform to the human > shape. In the new Museum of Western Art, the modulor system has been > observed in everything from the structural members to the architectural > details and furnishings.\\" > > \\\\- Tadayoshi, Fujiki, August 1959 \\"The Modular in the National Museum of > Western Art\\" Japan Architect, p. 48 Additional works to the building The museum has been added to over the years: Sakakura Associates designed a lecture hall and office building in 1964 and a ticket office in 1984. Whilst Maekawa Associates added a new annex in 1979 and in 1998 in conjunction with the Ministry of Construction, Yokoyama Engineering and Shimizu Construction installed earthquake resistant foundations to the museum.Reynolds, (2001), p179 Recognition In 1998, the importance of the structure was underscored when it was included in the former Ministry of Construction's survey‚Äîas one of the hundred selected public buildings (the Kokyo Kenchiku 100 Sen) which are outstanding and \\"well established in the local community.\\" In 2005 the museum was recognised by the international organisation DOCOMOMO as one of Japan's top one hundred modernist buildings.Spring 2005, \\"Do_co,mo.mo Japan: the 100 selection\\", The Japan Architect, No57 ;World Heritage Site In 2007, the building was registered by Japan on a provisional UNESCO list for World Heritage cultural site candidates as an Important Cultural Property, at the request of the French government. In July 2016 UNESCO listed 17 works by Le Corbusier as World Heritage Sites, including the 1959 National Museum of Western Art building.

The highway starts in the Niles area at M-139 and runs north through Watervliet to South Haven, ending at Interstate 196/US Highway 31 (I-196/US 31). In between, it runs through farm fields and past lakes in the southwestern part of the Lower Peninsula. The trunkline is used, on average, by between 1,500 and 10,200 vehicles. The state designated M-140 in the early 1930s over a previous alignment of US 31 when that highway rerouted through the area. M-140 was extended from Watervliet to Niles a few years later. Changes were made to the routing of the trunkline in the 1950s and 1960s. The last change was made in 1972, resulting in the modern course for the highway. Route description M-140 starts at an intersection with M-139 near the St. Joseph River north of Niles and runs due north through farm fields. The trunkline jogs to the west near Steinbauer Lake before returning to the northerly course. There is another westerly jog along Pokagon Road around Riggins Lake. M-140 turns back northward and runs through the community of Berrien Center. Near Eau Claire, the highway turns bends along Maple Grove Road for about before going north on Watervliet Road. East of town, the trunkline follows Main Street eastward toward the Berrien‚ÄìCass county line. M-140 intersects the northern terminus of M-62 and curves north. In northern Berrien County, M-140 follows Watervliet Road to an interchange with Interstate 94 (I-94). The highway continues northward along Main Street into Watervliet, running through the middle of town and intersecting Red Arrow Highway, the former US 12\\\\. North of downtown, the trunkline curves through residential neighborhoods to the northeast around the east end of Paw Paw Lake. M-140 crosses into western Van Buren County about north of Watervliet. The highway crosses, and parallels, the Van Buren Trail in Covert. In South Haven Township, M-140 connects the South Haven Area Regional Airport with the I-196/US 31 freeway; north of this interchange, the highway continues as Business Loop I-196. M-140 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-140 were the 10,176 vehicles daily near in Watervliet; the lowest count was 1,536 vehicles per day along Pokagon Road, on average. All of M-140 is a two-lane, undivided highway, except sections in cities like Watervliet which may have up to four lanes. No section of the trunkline has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13, 1913, by an act of the Michigan Legislature; at the time, one of the system's divisions corresponded to the initial segment of M-140. Division 5 followed a course from Niles northward to Mackinaw City that encompassed the highway between Watervliet and South Haven. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) signposted the highway system for the first time, and the future M-140 corridor was assigned to part of the original M-11. On November 11, 1926, M-11 was redesignated as part of US 31 in the state. In 1931, the state transferred US 31 to a new routing between the St. Joseph and South Haven areas; in the process, the former route of US 31 between Watervliet and South Haven was redesignated as M-140. The highway was extended southward from Watervliet to the Niles area in late 1934 due to heavy traffic on that section. The concurrency between M-62 and M-140 was eliminated around the end of 1957 when the former highway was truncated to terminate east of Eau Claire instead of continuing west into town. In 1958, the route north of Watervliet to the county line was realigned, smoothing several sharp curves. The construction of the I-196/US 31 freeway around the South Haven area impacted the northern terminus of M-140 in the 1960s. When it opened in 1963, BL I-196 was shown on maps as continuing north along M-140 into town to a junction with M-43. In 1972, the business loop was rerouted, and M-140 was truncated to end at the freeway interchange south of town.

This was the seventh match of first-class status to be played in England since 1939. All but two of the England team either already had, or would later gain, Test caps, and the other two (Eddie Phillipson and Jack Davies) would play over 150 first-class matches apiece, but the Dominions side was far more uneven in this regard. Such luminaries as Learie Constantine (captaining the team in his final first-class match) and Keith Miller rubbed shoulders with the likes of Hartley Craig for whom this was his only first-class game.

An explosion occurred at the plant of solvent and ink manufacturer CAI Inc., located in the Danversport area of Danvers, Massachusetts, which it shared with paint manufacturer Arnel. The explosion was caught on security camera and was reportedly heard up to 50 miles away in southern Maine and New Hampshire. Arnel ceased operations after the blast. Cause A May 13, 2008 report from the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board attributed the explosion to unintentional overnight heating of an ink-mixing tank containing flammable solvents. Damage The New England Home for the Deaf was boarded up after the explosion only a few hundred yards away. The explosion damaged over 90 homes, blowing out windows and knocking some houses off their foundations. Officials believed that some of the more extensively damaged houses would have to be leveled and rebuilt. Some of the buildings damaged included a bakery, boats at a nearby marina, and the New England Home for the Deaf, an assisted-living facility for people who are deaf or deafblind and elderly residents requiring constant care. \\"These people are extremely fragile,\\" said state Rep. Ted Speliotis, D-Danvers, whose district includes the affected area. \\"Many of them have Alzheimer's and other illnesses. It's clear they can't stay here long, but it's clear they won't be able to return for quite a while.\\" Danvers Fire Chief James P. Tutko toured the area by helicopter and said many residents would be kept from their homes for the foreseeable future. \\"It looks like a war zone, that's the only thing I can say\\" Tutko said. Fortunately, no one was killed. \\"Somebody out there likes us\\", Tutko commented. Finally, he said that determining the cause of the explosion would take days. Outgoing governor Mitt Romney toured the area and said the explosion was a \\"Thanksgiving miracle\\", as the explosion was \\"equivalent to a 2,000 lb bomb going off in a residential neighborhood,\\" and that no one was killed. In an area that included over 300 residents, just 10 people reported minor injuries. Residents of the area were evacuated to the Danvers High School, where temporary shelter was set up by the American Red Cross of Massachusetts Bay. Donations were taken for residents affected by the explosion. Residents were also advised to start filing insurance claims right away and to keep track of their expenses. Environmental impact There were minor environmental concerns due to water runoff of chemicals. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's on-scene coordinator Mike Nalipinski, preliminary tests showed low levels of toluene, a solvent, but said it was insignificant. Water runoff from the water used by firefighters left a purple sheen on the river and tests were conducted. However, the water is not a local drinking water supply, and the chemical evaporates quickly. Chief Tutko said there was no risk of toxic fumes getting into the air. An Eastern Propane facility is located near the area, however, it was not the source of the explosion. A spokesman for the company said that although the property suffered some minor damage, their tanks are secure. According to WHDH television, a person who answered the telephone at CAI's Georgetown, Massachusetts headquarters refused comment, and a telephone message left at the company president's home was not returned.

Shain is also a nationally known commentator on Israeli television and radio. He has been a guest on many political news shows in Europe and the US, including the BBC, NBC, ABC, CNN, Fox News, CNBC, PBS, Al-Jazeera, and The News Hour.  Ideas  According to Shain's recent book The Language of Corruption in Israel‚Äôs Moral Culture (in Hebrew), the Israeli judicial approach is counterproductive. It creates the impression that Israeli politics suffers from rampant corruption. This undermines the public‚Äôs trust in politics and politicians without addressing the real problem. Instead of a blanket prohibition against all political appointments, a more nuanced approach is in order, one that recognizes the realities of political life. In their Diasporas and International Relations Theory, Yossi Shain and Aharon Barth incorporate the study of diasporas into international relations (IR) theory by focusing on diasporas as independent actors who actively influence their homeland (kin- state) foreign policies. Shain and Barth argue that diasporic influences can best be understood by situating them in the 'theoretical space' shared by constructivism and liberalism; two approaches that acknowledge the impact of identity and domestic politics on international behavior.Shain, Y., & Barth, A. (January 01, 2003). Diasporas and international relations theory. International Organization, 573, 449-479. In his September 2014 article \\"The Two Faces of Qatar\\" in The American Interest, Shain develops his concerns regarding Qatar. He observes that \\"For years Qatar has played a brilliant a double game between Islamism and the West, offering aid and comfort for the forces of the former while doing the bare minimum asked of it by the latter,\\" yet Shain asks \\"whether this act beginning to wear thin?\\" Shain observes, that \\"recent events, however, have not all been favorable to Qatar‚Äôs strategy. In particular, the fall of the Muslim Brotherhood and the rise of Al-Sisi in Egypt were shattering blows to Qatar‚Äôs view of the Middle East. With the Muslim Brothers being the bitter enemies of the Egyptian regime, Egypt has also turned on its prime backers, the Qataris. And in Egypt today, Al Jazeera has developed a reputation as traitor to the Arab cause, and the Emir of Qatar as an instigator of radicalism and terror. Reporting on the crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt last February, Gregg Carlstrom noted how Al Jazeera became the mouthpiece of radical Jihadi views‚Äîfeaturing guests openly calling for an assault on the Egyptian Coptic minority.

It is a Korean dish made from a batter of eggs, wheat flour, rice flour, scallions, and often other ingredients depending on the variety. Beef, pork, kimchi, shellfish, and other seafood are mostly used. Pajeon at Doosan Encyclopedia If one of these ingredients, such as squid, dominates the jeon, the name will reflect that; ojing'eo jeon (Ïò§ÏßïÏñ¥Ï†Ñ) is 'squid jeon'. Pajeon is usually recognizable by the highly visible scallions. It is similar to a Chinese scallion pancake in appearance but is less dense in texture and not made from a dough.  Preparation  It is made by placing jjokpa scallions parallely on a hot pan with vegetable oil, pan-frying them, then ladling onto them the batter made by mixing wheat flour, water, soybean paste, and sugar. The pancake is turned over when the bottom holds together and is golden-brown. It is usually served with a dipping sauce made of soy sauce. Type Some varieties of pajeon, with the shape of scallions preserved as in dongnae pajeon are typical jeon. Some other varieties, with the scallions cut and mixed into the batter, are closer to buchimgae. Seafood pajeon In Korean, a seafood pajeon is called haemul pajeon (Ìï¥Î¨ºÌååÏ†Ñ). Various seafood are used in the batter and toppings, e.g., oysters, shrimp, squid, clams.Goldberg, Lina \\"Asia's 10 greatest street food cities\\" CNN Go. 23 March 2012.

The title is a Japanese slang shortening Romanization of the English term \\"extension\\" from \\"hair extension\\". The plot involves an aspiring hair dresser (Kuriyama) who becomes the infatuation of a tricophilic man who sells hair extensions to nearby hair salons. The source of the hair is the stolen corpse of a girl whose dead body continues to grow beautiful and voluminous black hair that comes alive, driving those who use the extensions insane or killing them. The movie was released in the U.S. as Exte: Hair Extensions. Plot Inside a shipping container, customs agents discover a huge amount of human hair used as materials for hair extensions, along with the body of a young girl with a shaved head. The corpse is transported to the morgue, where it is discovered that the girl's internal organs have been harvested by illegal organ traffickers. The morgue's night watchman, a tricophile named Yamazaki (Ren Osugi), is infatuated by the girl's hair and steals the body. He finds that the body has begun to grow hair everywhere: its head, vacant eye sockets, tongue, and open wounds. A delighted Yamazaki harvests the hair to make hair extensions to sell. However, the hair controls and kills its wearers, causing them to experience the dying memories of the dead girl, including the last thing she saw on the operating table: the smiling mouth of the man who killed her. Yuko (Chiaki Kuriyama) is a young apprentice hair stylist at a local salon. Her irresponsible older sister, Kiyomi (Tsugumi), dumps her eight-year- old daughter, Mami, on Yuko and her roommate Yuki (Megumi Sat≈ç). By happenstance Yamazaki encounters Yuko and Mami and find their hair beautiful. He comes to Yuko's salon the next day with his hair extensions, which her co- workers are impressed with. That night, Kondo, one of Yuko's co-workers, is killed when the hair begins sprouting from her eyes, head, and mouth. It is revealed through a flashback that the dead girl's head was shaved by her kidnappers before her murder. Meanwhile, Yuko and Yuki refuse to return Mami to Kiyomi due to her abuse of the child. Kiyomi returns while they are away and drags Mami back to her boyfriend's home, taking some of the hair extensions with her. After Mami is locked in a closet, the extensions kill Kiyomi and her boyfriend. Mami escapes the hair by jumping out of the window, injuring herself. Yuko later uses Mami as her model in a hairdressing workshop and attaches one of Yamazaki's hair extensions to her hair. The workshop is interrupted by detectives investigating Kondo's death. Yuko realizes that the hair extensions are the linking factor in the deaths and races home to save Mami. Yuki is strangled to death by the hair and Mami faints. Yuko arrives into the hair-filled apartment but is choked unconscious by the hair. Yamazaki arrives and commands the hair to spare Mami and Yuko. He takes them back to his hair-covered home. There, he discovers the detectives caught in the hair, who searched his house because of the deaths. He kills them as Yuko wakes up. Yamazaki explains that the girl's hair keeps growing to carry on her grudge against society. He wishes for Mami and Yuko to stay with him and the corpse forever. Yuko rejects him; Yamazaki, enraged, reveals that he allowed the hair to possess him, his tongue hairy and his blood and limbs replaced by hair. In anger, he cuts some of Mami's hair, which begins to bleed. The blood and Yamazaki's smiling cause the corpse to associate him with the man who killed her and she suddenly sits up and slices him to pieces with strands of hair while Yuko and Mami escape. Her grudge satisfied, the hair disappears and the girl's body returns to normal, finally at peace. Yuko asks Mami to live with her permanently, which Mami happily accepts.

The latter is also called gopchang-gui (; \\"grilled intestines\\"). The tube- shaped offal is chewy with rich elastic fibers. In Korean cuisine, it is stewed in a hot pot (gopchang-jeongol, Í≥±Ï∞ΩÏ†ÑÍ≥®), grilled over a barbecue (gopchang-gui), boiled in soup with other intestines (naejang-tang), or made into a sausage (sundae). In the past, gopchang was a popular, nutritious, and cheap dish for the general public. Rich in iron and vitamins, it was served as a health supplement for improving a weak constitution, recovering patients, and postpartum depression. Today, gopchang is also regarded as a delicacy and is more expensive than the regular meat of the same weight. It is a popular anju (food served and eaten with soju), as it helps break down alcohol. Gopchang is an exotic food for foreigners. but It is also one of the most popular foods to try in Korea.  Preparation  The intestines are cleaned thoroughly, rubbed with wheat flour and coarse salt, and rinsed several times. The fat is trimmed off, and the cleaned gopchang is soaked in water to remove any traces of blood. Garlic, ginger, onion, cooking wine, black pepper, and Korean pepper are common marinating ingredients, mainly used for eliminating any unpleasant odors and tenderizing the meat of gopchang. Ingredients for gopchang-gui marinade are juiced, rather than minced, so that they don't burn during the grilling process. Common ingredients include soy sauce, gochutgaru (chili powder), mullyeot (rice syrup), cheongju (rice wine), onion juice, apple juice, garlic juice, scallion juice, and ginger juice. The gopchang is first marinated in the seasonings and spices, then grilled on a lightly greased pan or griddle. Onions and bell peppers are often grilled together with gopchang. Grilled gopchang is often served dipped in salt and sesame oil. After that, usually Bokkumbab (Hangul: Î≥∂ÏùåÎ∞•) is cooked with Gopchang oil.  Varieties and similar dishes  Gopchang of pork big intestines is usually called dwaeji-gopchang (; \\"pig gopchang\\"). In Korean cuisine, food similar to gopchang prepared with beef blanket tripe is called yang-gopchang (; \\"rumen gopchang\\"), while the one prepared with beef reed tripe is called makchang (; \\"last tripe\\"), and the one with beef big intestines is called daechang (; \\"big innards\\"). Internationally, gopchang could be compared to chitterlings (pork's small intestines) or Latin American chunchullo (beef, pork, or lamb's small intestines). The Spanish/Portuguese term tripas or the English tripe also occasionally referred to as small beef's intestines, attesting to the practice of consuming animal intestines as a truly worldwide phenomenon. Some foods have tripe in their dishes, such as stir-fried tripe and gopchang jeongol.

Route description M-152 begins at an intersection with South County Line Road on the border between Van Buren and Berrien counties just west of Round Lake. Known as 92nd Avenue, M-152 travels due east past the Sister Lakes area before turning south on 66th Street. From there, the road passes between Dewey and Magician Lakes before returning to its easterly course where it assumes the name Dewey Lake Street. Between the western terminus and Dewey Lake Street, the highway passes provides access to the cabins around the lakes. The route continues eastward for nearly three and a half miles through farmland before terminating at a junction with M-51. M-152 is not on the National Highway System, a system of regionally important highways. In a traffic survey by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2009, the department measured the average annual daily traffic (AADT), a computation of the average traffic levels for a segment of roadway on any given day of the year. This was calculated at 3,318 vehicles over the entire length of M-152. The commercial AADT in the same survey was 73 vehicles. History M-152 was assumed into the state trunkline system in 1933.

It involves the calculation of the mean after winsorizing -- replacing given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end with the most extreme remaining values,Dodge, Y (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. (entry for \\"winsorized estimation\\") typically doing so for an equal amount of both extremes; often 10 to 25 percent of the ends are replaced. The winsorized mean can equivalently be expressed as a weighted average of the truncated mean and the quantiles at which it is limited, which corresponds to replacing parts with the corresponding quantiles. Advantages The winsorized mean is a useful estimator because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean but will still give a reasonable estimate of central tendency or mean for almost all statistical models. In this regard it is referred to as a robust estimator. Drawbacks The winsorized mean uses more information from the distribution or sample than the median. However, unless the underlying distribution is symmetric, the winsorized mean of a sample is unlikely to produce an unbiased estimator for either the mean or the median. Example * For a sample of 10 numbers (from x1, the smallest, to x10 the largest) the 10% winsorized mean is :: \\\\frac{\\\\overbrace{x_2 + x_2} + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 + \\\\overbrace{x_9 + x_9}}{10}. \\\\, : The key is in the repetition of x2 and x9: the extras substitute for the original values x1 and x10 which have been discarded and replaced. :This is equivalent to a weighted average of 0.1 times the 5th percentile (x2), 0.8 times the 10% trimmed mean, and 0.1 times the 95th percentile (x9).

History The band was managed by Lou Pearlman and Lynn Harless (mother of Justin Timberlake). The original members were Danay Ferrer, Britney Spears, Mandy Ashford, Nikki DeLoach, and Amanda Latona. The group was formed in 1997. Their name was suggested by Pearlman and Harless. The band decided to misspell the name so they wouldn't sound like \\"innocent little four-year-olds.\\"In Concert Their inspirations were bands such as NSYNC and Backstreet Boys. Ashford was a member of the Attache show choir, along with high-school friend Lance Bass, with whom she also shared a vocal coach. Bass recommended Ashford to Pearlman, and she was selected to join the band. Later that same year, Spears decided to go solo and was later replaced by Veronica Finn. Latona left the band to go solo, and was replaced by Jenny Morris. Before she left, Innosense released one single, titled \\"Wherever You Are\\". A video for the song was released in Germany in 1998. Amanda Latona signed a solo contract with J Records and recorded \\"Can't Take It Back\\" (2002) and \\"Do You Still\\" (2003). Neither single did well, and she was later dropped from the label. Latona dated Backstreet Boy A.J. McLean. She was featured in 2002 in \\"Who's That Girl?\\", an article in The New York Times Magazine. The article chronicles J Records' grooming of Latona's career in an attempt to ensure her success. In 2001, Innosense appeared in the teen movie Longshot. Spears also appeared in the movie, but not with the rest of the group. When Spears' solo career began, Innosense became an opening act for her tour. The band released one album, whose lead single, \\"Say No More\\", hit #20 on Billboards Hot Singles Sales chart, but never charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The album itself never charted and as a result never found commercial success. In 2001, Morris left the group, which left them as a quartet. The second and final single from the album, \\"Rain Rain\\", was released only in Germany in 2002; however, it failed to chart. Innosense disbanded in 2003 to work on separate projects. Ashford has modeled in several publications, including Playboy magazine,StarHub and also served as a spokesmodel. DeLoach, an actress before Innosense, returned to acting with regular roles in such TV series as North Shore, Windfall, and most notably, as the mother of the lead character in MTV's Awkward.

It is the seventh entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot Unable to find work during the Great Depression, the Stooges are forced to look for jobs. Taking a merchant's brooms to sweep his sidewalk, they are mistaken for thieves by him, and soon find themselves on the run from the police. With a cop chasing them, they flee into an art school, where they are mistaken for art students. They take their first art lessons while hiding from the police, resulting in a climactic clay fight that takes no prisoners (the persistent cop is among the numerous people who get hit). The film ends when three art students break sculptures over the boys' heads, resulting in them being soundly beaten up.

Curly does, and Moe pokes him in the eyes with them. This would be a recurring joke. In addition, the short contains a very rare scene in which Moe delivers a slap in the face to several people at once. At the end of the clay fight scene, Moe stops everyone and asks, \\"Who started this?!\\" Larry yells, \\"YOU did!\\", to which Moe angrily replies, \\"Oh, YEAH?!\\" and, with right hand extended, spins in a counter-clockwise motion, slapping everyone around him. *A clay-throwing fight, a precursor to the classic pie fights which would become a staple of the Stooge films. The first genuine pie fight would appear the following year in Slippery Silks. *Moe holding out his fist to Curly and says, \\"See that?\\" When Curly replies, \\"Yeah,\\" he smacks the fist dismissively, in which it swings in a circle behind Moe's body, over his head, and bops Curly on the head with it. *Curly dressing in drag, a gag that would be revisited in several later Stooge shorts, such as Uncivil Warriors, Movie Maniacs, Whoops, I'm an Indian!, Wee Wee Monsieur, Mutts to You, Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise, Nutty But Nice, Matri-Phony, Micro- Phonies, Uncivil War Birds and Rhythm and Weep. The title of the film Pop Goes the Easel is a pun on the nursery rhyme \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\", which is used for the one and only time as the opening theme. The film also ends with the tune, as with the ending of Punch Drunks. It was filmed on February 6‚Äì11, 1935. The two girls playing hopscotch on the sidewalk are Larry Fine's daughter, Phyllis (who died in 1989 at age 60) and Moe Howard's daughter, Joan. A colorized version of Pop Goes the Easel was released in 2006 as part of the DVD collection entitled \\"Stooges on the Run\\".Stooges on the Run According to the updated version of the book The Three Stooges Scrapbook, there was an alternate clay fight in the script by Jules White. It was listed as unused or edited. A careful viewer of the clay fight can see some places where the two clay battles were filmed and edited to make one battle. Differences include: The female model is standing in the foreground close to the screen at the beginning, but when she's hit with clay she's standing in front of the windows. She's brunette throughout the whole short, but at the ending, her hair is blonde. As the Stooges walk through the studio, there are spots on the wall made from clay. The officer who was chasing them is out cold and struck with a piece of clay, but later is shown getting his toupee knocked off his head (from a thrown piece) as he is throwing clay.Lenburg, Jeff, Joan Howard Maurer, and Greg Lenburg (2012).The Three Stooges Scrapbook.

It is currently owned by the Civic Auditorium Historic Preservation Committee, a non-profit corporation formed specifically for the purpose of purchasing it from the City of The Dalles to save it from scheduled demolition, restore it, and operate it as a local and regional cultural center. \\"The Civic,\\" as it is most commonly called, was once an important center of cultural and recreational activity for its community and region, and after more than a decade of dereliction and disuse, has been partially restored with plans in place for complete rehabilitation. The facility is becoming, once again, the site of public and private events. Architecture The Civic was designed by the Portland architectural firm of Houghtaling & Dougan, whose work includes the Jeffrey Center Building in Portland, and countless other prominent Oregon buildings, many still standing. The light tan brick building occupies nearly one-quarter of a city block, and is an example of the neoclassical style common to public and governmental buildings of its era, more frequently implemented in stone or concrete block construction. In addition to its over 1100-seat auditorium proper (or theater), with balcony, which is still at the planning stage for restoration, the building also boasts a grand ballroom with \\"floating\\" hardwood floor with its own balcony (or mezzanine), a \\"fireside room,\\" for meetings, and a gymnasium. History The site of the Civic Auditorium was the location of a livery stable which had operated since the 1870s. In 1921, the era of horse and buggy coming to a close, the property was purchased by the city in 1921 from Frank McCullough. Construction began the following year, and upon completion the Civic was dedicated as a memorial to the local veterans of World War I. During its heyday, it was the venue for local cultural, entertainment, ceremonial, social, and recreational events ranging from concerts and theatricals to high school graduation ceremonies. In the 1950s and early 1960s, it was operated by the city Parks & Recreation Department, who held indoor recreational activities and \\"sock hops,\\" referred to as \\"Rec Dances,\\" in its gymnasium for local youth. Toward the end of that era, the facility had largely fallen into disuse, the auditorium proper having been turned into a professional wrestling arena. It was ultimately condemned for safety reasons. By the 1970s some initiatives were already beginning to be proposed to the city for its rehabilitation and reopening, but because of budgetary pressures, worsened by local economic conditions, none of these gained approval. The renovation project currently underway, and as of 2006 approximately 50% accomplished, was one such proposal prepared for consideration by the city in 1984. By 1991, after over 20 years of disuse, the city decided it needed to be relieved of the burden of maintaining a derelict property, and demolition was scheduled. This, despite the building's status as a historical landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The same year, a group of concerned citizens formed the non-profit corporation which raised the funds to purchase the property from the city, and undertook the project privately.

When the Cossacks laid siege to Polonnoye, Samson, with 300 of his followers, arrayed in their shrouds and praying-shawls, went to the synagogue, and stood there praying until the enemy came and butchered them all. Ostropoli was a noted kabalist. He was the author of a commentary (published by his nephew Pesa·∏• at Zolkiev in 1709) on the kabalistic work ·∏≤arnayim. According to the author of Yewen Me·∫ìulah, he wrote also a commentary on the Zohar, titled Machane Dan, in conformity with the cabalistic system of Isaac Luria, but this work has not been preserved. Other works of his are: Dan Yadin, a commentary on an early cryptic kabalistic work called Sefer Karnayim. A collection of all Rabbi Shimshon's known Torah commentaries called Nitzotzay Shimshon.

He played college football for the Oklahoma State University Cowboys, and was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the sixth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He won Super Bowl XLI with the Colts against the Chicago Bears. Early years Johnson attended Sherman High School in Sherman, Texas, the same high school former Colts' punter Hunter Smith attended. At Oklahoma State, he was converted from a tight end to an offensive tackle. Professional career Indianapolis Colts Johnson during Super Bowl XLIV. Johnson was selected with the Indianapolis Colts' sixth-round pick in the 2006 NFL draft. As a rookie, he started one game, filling in for the injured right tackle Ryan Diem against Tennessee in week 13, and, additionally, filled in for Diem for a portion of Super Bowl XLI. Due to the retirement of stalwart LT Tarik Glenn, Johnson had an opportunity to win the starting left tackle job during his second season, but was beaten out by rookie Tony Ugoh. Injuries to Ugoh and Diem, however, led to Johnson starting 10 of 16 games at LT and RT, respectively. Johnson's performance during the 2007 was widely viewed by fans as a disappointment (the 2007 season marked the first time in five years that the colts finished out of the top 5 in least sacks allowed), considering the competence he had shown as a rookie. In Johnson's third season, he was moved to left guard in order to compensate for the loss of injured starter Ryan Lilja. Johnson started all 16 games, 12 at LG and 4 at LT, and was one of only two starting OL (the other being Ryan Diem) to play in every game that season. The following year, Johnson beat out underachieving starter Tony Ugoh for the starting LT position during training camp. Through 6 games, Johnson has demonstrated solid improvement at his position, in contrast to previous years' performances. Minnesota Vikings On August 1, 2011, Johnson signed with the Minnesota Vikings. He played left tackle in his first full season with the Vikings but was then moved to left guard after the team drafted tackle Matt Kalil from USC. On February 27, 2015, Johnson was released by the Vikings. He is currently (2017) the offensive line coach for Stillwater High School in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

Plot Oliver Quackenbush (Lou Costello), Molly (Martha O'Driscoll) and her brother Slats (Bud Abbott) work for the Miramar Ballroom as taxi dancers. Slats plants a phony article in the local newspaper that declares Molly's ambition is to attend Bixby College. The dean of Bixby (Donald Cook) reads the article and offers her a scholarship. She agrees, but only if Oliver and Slats can accompany her. They are hired as caretakers. Meanwhile, Chairman Kirkland (Charles Dingle), whose daughter Diane (June Vincent) also attends Bixby, holds the mortgage on the college and threatens to foreclose if the dean continues to ignore tradition and does not expel Molly. Slats and Oliver run into some problems of their own as they fail at every task assigned to them by their supervisor, Mr. Johnson (Lon Chaney, Jr.). Slats devises a plan to raise $20,000 to save the school: Oliver will wrestle the Masked Marvel. However, just before the match the Masked Marvel becomes ill and is replaced by Mr. Johnson. Oliver still manages to win the match, and Slats takes the $1,000 winnings and bets it on Bixby in a basketball game at 20-to-1 odds. Unfortunately the bookie attempts to ensure the outcome by hiring a professional team to play in place of Bixby's opponent, Carleton. Oliver dresses in drag and joins the Bixby team. Halfway through the game he receives a bump on the head and is convinced he is Daisy Dimple, \\"the world's greatest woman basketball player.\\" Bixby pulls into the lead, but Oliver suffers another bump on the head and returns to his usual persona, and ends up losing the game for Bixby.

Published in 1914, it is a major early work in the field of industrial psychology and scientific management. A contemporary book review reflects early resistance to scientific management, stating the book \\"does not answer the really important questions about the effect of standardized work upon the worker\\". In this book, Gilbreth defines \\"the psychology of management\\" as \\"the effect of the mind that is directing work upon that work which is directed, and the effect of this undirected and directed work upon the mind of the worker.\\" She expresses the view that scientific management is \\"built on the principle of recognition of the individual, not only as an economic unit but as a personality\\", stressing the importance of including the \\"human element\\" in management, which was lacking in the prevailing form of Taylorism at the time. It was also the first time that basic elements of management theory were brought together, including \\"(1) knowledge of individual behavior, (2) the theory of groups, (3) the theory of communication, and (4) a rational basis for decision making\\". This book was originally Gilbreth's unpublished dissertation for a doctorate from the University of California; however, since the university refused to grant her the degree due to her noncompliance with residency requirements, she instead opted to publish it. It was originally serialized during 1912-1913 in Industrial Engineering and Engineering Digest, before it was published in book form in 1914.

He was the Robert A. Millikan Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1947 until his retirement in 1987.. (Biographical details from bottom of page 95.) Early life and education William McNeill was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the son of theologian and educator John T. McNeill, where he lived until age ten. The family then moved to Chicago, while spending summers on a family farm on Canada's Prince Edward Island. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938 from the University of Chicago, where he was editor of the student newspaper and \\"was inspired by the anthropologist Robert Redfield\\". He earned a Master of Arts degree in 1939, also at the University of Chicago, and wrote his thesis on Thucydides and Herodotus. He began working towards a Ph.D. in history at Cornell University under Carl L. Becker. In 1941, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in World War II in the European theater. After the war, he returned to Cornell for his Ph.D., which he earned in 1947. Career Teaching In 1947, McNeill began teaching at the University of Chicago, where he remained throughout his teaching career. He chaired the university's Department of History from 1961 to 1967, establishing its international reputation. During his tenure as chair, he recruited Henry Moore to cast a bronze statue called Nuclear Energy commemorating the University of Chicago as the place where the world's first manmade nuclear chain reaction took place in 1942. In 1988 he was a visiting professor at Williams College, where he taught a seminar on The Rise of the West. He has stated that teaching \\"is the most wonderful way to learn things\\". According to John W. Boyer, the University of Chicago's Dean and a former student of McNeill's, McNeill was \\"one of the most important historians to teach at the University of Chicago in the twentieth century\\". He retired from teaching in 1987 and moved to Colebrook, Connecticut. Writing McNeill's best-known work is The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community, which was published in 1963, relatively early in his career. The book explored world history in terms of the effect different old world civilizations had on one another, and cites the deep influence of Western civilization on the rest of the world to argue that societal contact with foreign civilizations is the primary force in driving historical change. It had a major impact on historical theory by emphasizing cultural fusions, in contrast to Spengler's view of discrete, independent civilizations. Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote a glowing review in The New York Times Book Review. McNeill's Rise of the West won the U.S. National Book Award in History and Biography in 1964. From 1971 to 1980, he served as the editor of The Journal of Modern History. His Plagues and Peoples (1976), was an important early contribution to the study of the impact of disease on human history. In 1982, he published The Pursuit of Power, which examined the role of military forces, military technology, and war in human history. In 1989 he published a biography of his mentor Arnold J. Toynbee. In 1992 review, he disagreed with Francis Fukuyama's argument in The End of History and the Last Man that the end of the Cold War meant that the American model of a capitalist liberal democracy had become the \\"final form of human government\\", as Fukuyama put it. In 1997 he disagreed with the central thesis of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel for overlooking the importance of human \\"cultural autonomy\\" in determining human development versus Diamond's focus on environmental factors. In 2003, he coauthored The Human Web: A Bird's-eye View of World History with his son and fellow historian J. R. McNeill. Awards and honors In addition to winning the U.S. National Book Award in History and Biography in 1964 for The Rise of the West, McNeill received several other awards and honors. In 1985 he served as president of the American Historical Association. In 1996, McNeill won the prestigious Erasmus Prize, which the Crown Prince of the Netherlands Willem-Alexander presented to him at Amsterdam's Royal Palace. In 1999, Modern Library named The Rise of the West of the 100 Best Nonfiction Books of the 20th century.\\"100 Best Nonfiction\\". Modern Library (Board). Random House. 1999. In 2009, he won the National Humanities Medal. In February 2010, President Barack Obama, a former University of Chicago professor himself, awarded McNeill the National Humanities Medal to recognize \\"his exceptional talent as a teacher and scholar at the University of Chicago and as an author of more than 20 books, including The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community (1963), which traces civilizations through 5,000 years of recorded history\\". Personal life In 1946 McNeill married Elizabeth Darbishire, whom he met during his military service during World War II as an assistant military attach√© to the Greek and Yugoslavian governments-in-exile in Cairo. She died in 2006. McNeill himself died in July 2016 at the age of 98. Works * (1947). * (1949). History of Western Civilization: A Handbook.

It is one of only three trunklines in Michigan on islands. The other two are M-134 on Drummond Island and M-185 on Mackinac Island. Access to Harsens Island and M-154 is provided by ferry which runs year round. The highway was first designated in 1931, and realigned on the island within the next two years. Route description M-154 begins where Green Road merges with South Channel Drive on Harsens Island at the mouth of the St. Clair River. From there the road travels northward around the east edge of the island for about before it cuts a block inland. It continues on to the northeast, still as Green Road until it reaches an intersection with La Croix Road, at which point it turns northwest. It continues on this path before curving back around to the northeast on Columbine Street where it continues up to an intersection with Channel Drive, where it turns west and terminates at the Harsens Island Ferry dock. The road runs primarily through sparsely populated areas except where it abuts the shore lines where denser housing exists. Like other state highways in Michigan, M-154 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 1,137 vehicles used the highway daily. No section of M-154 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Like M-154, there are two other highways located on islands in the state, M-134 connects by ferry across the DeTour Passage to Drummond Island, and M-185 is located on Mackinac Island. History M-154 has existed on Harsens Island since 1931. The original routing started in the northeast corner of the island travelling down Channel Drive to Little Avenue, which does not exist in its entirety today. From here it the connected LaCroix Road and matched up with the present day alignment at this point. In late 1932 or early 1933, rather than routing M-154 onto Little Avenue, it was rerouted along LaCroix Road where it curves onto Columbine Street to North Channel Road where it terminates at the present day ferry dock.

In addition, the earliest snowfall ever noted in both Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia occurred on the southwest side of this cyclone. Over 10,000 were without power during the storm. No longer a nor'easter, the extratropical cyclone accelerated rapidly across the North Atlantic while rapidly strengthening, becoming a cyclonic storm again by November 25, but this time with hurricane-force sustained winds. The intense low made a cyclonic loop west of Iceland, before being absorbed by another strengthening extratropical cyclone to the west of Great Britain, late on December 1. Meteorological synopsis A shortwave moved through the southern stream of the polar jet of the Westerlies, dropping temperatures in its wake across the southeast United States. Cyclogenesis spurred a developing surface cyclone which quickly occluded on November 20. Surface pressure gradient between this cyclone and a sprawling high stretching around its periphery from New England into the Deep South led to strong winds in the Carolinas. The cyclone deepened to a central pressure of before swinging westward into the Outer Banks of North Carolina on November 22. At this time, a trio of upper- level shortwaves were rotating around the main closed cyclone aloft, which spurred development of a new, weaker low pressure center offshore North Carolina. This cyclone was weaker after its interaction with North Carolina until it reached New England, when renewed strengthening led to significant impacts across Long Island and southern New England. The system then began accelerating east-northeast while continuing to slowly strengthen, passing offshore Atlantic Canada on November 24. The cyclone subsequently bombed, or strengthened quite rapidly, and accelerated east-northeast, becoming a hurricane-force storm in the far north Atlantic with a central pressure of by the afternoon of November 25 and peaking at by the morning of November 26.Ocean Prediction Center.

By the evening of November 27, its central pressure had increased to while located a couple hundred miles south of Iceland.

It was engineered by Weidlinger Associates and built by Richard White Sons, Inc. for a cost of approximately $2.5 million.Weidlinger Associates portfolio Structure The chapel consists of an concrete cylinder surfaced with a layer of patinaed bronze. On one side of the cylinder is a pyramidal glass greenhouse that houses a below-ground koi pond decorated with live plants, a small waterfall, and concrete blocks that serve as stepping stones. Outside the chapel is a rectangular marble tower containing a two-story steel pole and a large bronze ball. The tower is a functioning clock; as the ball moves up and down the pole, lines on the tower indicate the time of day. The timepiece was designed by Karl Schlamminger. Interior The chapel itself occupies nearly all of the ground floor of the building and is accessed through a tall metal door from the greenhouse. The interior is a two-story stone cylinder with several semi-circular concrete constructions scalloping the walls. At the top of the cylinder are thin windows with several long prisms designed by the artist Charles Ross that create raking light and occasionally rainbows across the austere concrete interior. Usage The furnishings are simple and consist primarily of rows of wooden chairs, which seat approximately 100 people, a spare concrete altar, a piano, and a harpsichord.

Brennan returned to Notre Dame in 1953 as freshman football coach and succeeded Frank Leahy as head coach the following year. When asked if he thought he was too young to be named head coach at the age of 25, Brennan replied, \\"Oh, I don't know. I'll be 26 in a few months.\\" Brennan got off to a good start with a 9‚Äì1 campaign in 1954 with players recruited by Leahy. In 1955, the Irish slipped a notch to 8‚Äì2. Then the roof fell in. Brennan was forced to play mostly sophomores in 1956 because of numerous injuries and the result was a 2‚Äì8 record, the first losing season for Notre Dame since 1933 and the worst in the history of the school. The lone bright spot was Paul Hornung, who won the Heisman Trophy. Many fans called for Brennan's ouster, but the young coach was retained. One thing that worked against Brennan was a movement by school administrators to put more emphasis on academics and less on athletics, leading to the popular notion that Notre Dame had deemphasized football. Consequently, Brennan had to make do with players of lesser talent than in previous years, with a limit of 20 football scholarships per class, while continuing to play tough schedules. While academics had always come first at Notre Dame, Frank Leahy had carte blanche to do what he wished until the Rev. Theodore Martin Hesburgh became president in 1952. One of Hesburgh's first priorities as president was to reaffirm Notre Dame's position on academics. One of the other major restraints was the fact that within that construct Leahy had recruited a large number of players and offered them all scholarships. These players largely proved ineffective. However, and especially given the new self-imposed scholarship restrictions, this prevented Brennan from recruiting any recruiting classes worthy of the university or himself... Brennan was essentially recruiting and coaching with his hands figuratively tied behind his back. However... Brennan's 1957 squad earned the nickname, \\"Comeback Comets\\" after finishing 7‚Äì3. Among their victories was a 23‚Äì21 comeback over Army and a 7‚Äì0 shutout of Oklahoma, snapping the Sooners' NCAA record 47-game winning streak. While Brennan kept the Irish competitive during his tenure (the dismal 1956 season notwithstanding), his teams' performances were well short of what fans had come to expect even allowing for the reduction in scholarships. After a 6‚Äì4 record in 1958, the movement to dismiss Brennan gained momentum, and the coach was fired along with his entire staff in mid-December; Hugh Devore was eventually retained. Notre Dame's administration was heavily criticized for the firing, since Brennan's overall 32‚Äì18 record was not bad considering the caliber of their opponents. He was succeeded as Notre Dame's head coach by Joe Kuharich. Later life and honors Brennan served as player conditioning coach for baseball's Cincinnati Reds during spring training in 1959 and eventually joined a Chicago investment banking firm. He has six children, 27 grandchildren, and sixteen great-grandchildren. Brennan is a member of the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame and was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1981.

Biography Scott was born in 1927, in Honolulu. He graduated from Greenbrier Military School in Lewisburg, West Virginia, in 1945 and entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1946. Upon graduation from the academy in 1950, he received a bachelor of science degree in military science and a commission as a second lieutenant. General Scott earned a master of arts degree in international law and relations from The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., in 1963. He completed the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1964 and the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1967. He received his wings upon completion of pilot training in August 1951 at Craig Air Force Base, Alabama. After advanced fighter pilot training at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, he was assigned as a tactical reconnaissance pilot at Kimpo Air Base, South Korea, where he completed a combat tour of duty in F-51 Mustangs. From 1952 to 1959, General Scott served in many operational and maintenance positions flying F-80s, F-86s and F-100s. In 1958 he won individual honors as high man in the Pacific Air Forces Fighter Weapons Meet flying the F-100 Super Sabre. Scott was assigned as an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps instructor from May 1959 to July 1962, and then as professor of aerospace studies at the Catholic University of America until August 1963. He completed the Armed Forces Staff College in February 1964 and then transferred to Royal Air Force Station Lakenheath, England, as commander of the 492d Tactical Fighter Squadron. He entered the Naval War College in August 1966 and after graduation completed transition training with the 476th Tactical Fighter Squadron at George Air Force Base, California, where he was top gun in the F-4D Phantom.

From 1969 to 1977, Scott held various command and staff positions: action officer on the Air Staff, wing commander, division commander, vice commander of an air logistics center, and commander of a technical training center. Scott served as assistant deputy chief of staff, plans and operations, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C., from August 1977 until June 1978.

Mendel Rivers Award for Excellence. In 1985, while Superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Scott accomplished the Academy's freefall parachute training. At nearly 60 years old, he was the oldest and highest-ranking person to earn jump wings through that program, said to be the only training program in the world where the student's very first jump is accomplished as solo freefall (as opposed to solo static line or tandem freefall). A point of irony is that Willard W. Scott was a cadet at West Point at the same time as Winfield W. Scott, with Willard being two years senior to Winfield. While they share W. W. Scott as their abbreviated name, the two are not related. But both attained the rank of Lieutenant General and both became service academy superintendents, with Willard being the superintendent of West Point through several of the same years that Winfield was superintendent at Air Force. Winfield W. Scott was promoted to lieutenant general August 22, 1978, with date of rank August 21, 1978. He retired August 1, 1987.

It was originally designated in the early 1930s and outlasted the hospital which closed in 1982. The roadway was removed from state maps after 1991 but remains under state maintenance as an unsigned trunkline listed as either M-155 or Old M-155. Route description OLD M-155 begins in front of the former state hospital on High Hillcrest Drive and runs north and northwesterly through a field and out of the property. The road passes some houses in the area as it curves onto Country Farm Road next to Sanatorium Lake, turning northward. From there, the trunkline follows Country Farm Road to Norton Road through Marion Township. The trunkline follows Norton Road east over the South Branch of the Shiawassee River and then northeasterly past a residential subdivision. OLD M-155 then turns due east on Mason Road, running along the Marion‚ÄìHowell township line before crossing into the city of Howell next to I-96. There is no interchange for the unsigned trunkline as it crosses over the freeway. The trunkline runs through more residential subdivisions before it turns northward onto Michigan Avenue. After , the trunkline terminates at the intersection with BL I-96 (Grand River Avenue) in downtown Howell. As the highway is still under state jurisdiction, M-155 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 13,699 vehicles used the highway daily in Howell and 3,960 vehicles did so each day near the southern terminus, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of OLD M-155 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History The Michigan State Sanatorium was opened on September 1, 1907, to treat adult patients with tuberculosis. Children were later treated there starting in 1915. After 1955 the hospital also handled patients with mental illnesses. In 1961 the sanatorium became the Howell State Hospital, and later the Hillcrest Center in 1978. The facility operated until September 30, 1982, when it was closed. and the building finally demolished a few years after. M-155 was designated in 1931; it began at the hospital and ran to a junction with US Highway 16 (modern BL I-96) in Howell. After the hospital was abandoned, the trunkline designation remained on the road, serving a field. The designation last appeared on official state maps in 1991.

She founded the Tokyo Women's Medical University in 1900, as the first medical school for women in Japan. She was also known as Washiyama Yayoi. Biography Yoshioka was born in what is now part of Kakegawa city, Shizuoka prefecture, where her father, a physician, advocated primary education for the village children. Yayoi grew up in the 19th century when women's education was frowned upon. She graduated from the Saisei-Gakusha school of medicine, and received the 27th medical license granted to a woman in Japan. Realizing the difficulty of this career path for women in Japan, she resolved to start her own school of medicine, which she did before she was 30 years old. The graduates of the Tokyo Women's Medical School (renamed the Tokyo Women's Medical University in 1998) were not allowed to practice medicine until 1912, when the Japanese government permitted women to enroll in the national medical examination. By 1930, almost a thousand women had gone through Yoshioka's school. Yayoi was politically active through her life. With many of her colleagues, she advocated sex education.Sabine Fr√ºhst√ºck, Colonizing Sex: Sexology and Social Control in Modern Japan, University of California Press (2003) . In the 1930s, Yayoi was involved in the Japanese women's suffrage movement and the \\"Clean Elections\\" movement in Japan. In 1938, the Japanese government appointed Yayoi and ten other female leaders to the \\"Emergency Council to Improve the Nation's Ways of Living,\\" a pre-war mobilization effort. She was a leading figure in various wartime patriotic women's associations and youth associations. After the end of the war, she turned again to organizations promoting the education of women. Yayoi was awarded the Order of the Precious Crown in 1955, and the Order of the Sacred Treasure posthumously in 1959. The Yoshioka Memorial Prize was established to honor Yoshioka's successors. The Japan Medical Women's Association has named its two awards after Yoshioka Yayoi and Ogino Ginko (the first woman to be licensed as a physician in Japan). Yayoi was depicted on an 80-yen Japanese commemorative postage stamp, on September 20, 2000 together with Naruse Jinzo and Tsuda Umeko.

Plot In January 1945, as the Second World War in Europe is reaching its end, much of the Netherlands remains under Nazi occupation. One night, a Nazi collaborator is shot dead on his bicycle. The family whose house he falls down in front of moves the body in front of the neighboring house, where the Steenwijk family lives. The Nazis, assuming that the Steenwijks killed the collaborator, execute the parents and older brother together with a large number of hostages. Burning the Steenwijks‚Äô house to the ground, they imprison the younger brother, Anton. The other person in his unlit cell is an older woman. Anton can see only her mouth. She spends the next few minutes comforting him until he is removed from the cell. After the Netherlands are liberated from Nazi occupation, Anton remains shaken by what has happened. The story moves between the end of World War II and the 1980s, following Steenwijk's often reluctant quest for the truth about the events of that traumatic night.

The river separates the characters in the River Baptists by flowing between them, and it forces them to meet when they use the ferry or need to travel across the river to the township. It gives the illusion of independence to the characters by separating them the community, but it also isolates when there are threats or danger. The story is set in a small town and it is clear that there are few secrets kept from the locals: the interest of the locals is not only curiosity, but because they are looking out for each other. For the newcomers to the town this help is often unexpected. While the river is a strong and constant force that moves purposefully though the novel, in contract the main characters seem to be aimlessly drifting through life or escaping from their pasts and surviving day to day. It is only when they are forced to act, or when in a crisis they need make a decision, that they seem to wake up and take charge of their lives.

An early portrait, Lady Angela Forbes, photographed by Wilding in 1921 Dorothy Frances Edith Wilding (10 January 1893 ‚Äì 9 February 1976) was an English professional portrait photographer from Gloucester, who established successful studios in both London and New York. She is known for her portraits of the British Royal Family, some of which were used to illustrate postage stamps, and in particular for her studies of actors and celebrities which fused glamour with modernist elegance. The historian Val Williams noted Wilding's combination of business savvy and deep understanding of aesthetic impact: 'nobody knew better than Dorothy Wilding the power of the photograph to create or destroy the desired image.' Early life Wilding wanted to become an actress or artist, but these careers were not encouraged by her uncle, in whose family she lived, so she chose instead photography, which she started to learn from the age of sixteen. Wilding obtained studio experience with the American portraitist Marian Nielson, before working as a re-toucher for Richard Speight in New Bond Street; in 1914, she opened her first studio. Career By 1929 Wilding had already moved studio a few times and in her Bond Street studio attracted theatrical stars and shot her first British Royal Family portrait of the 26-year-old Prince George (later Duke of Kent) in 1928. Six years later Wilding was selected to take the official engagement photographs of Prince George before his marriage to Princess Marina of Greece. In 1935 a sitting booked for a Mrs Simpson on a Friday found Wilding away from the studio. Instead her leading deputy camera operator Maryon Parham took photographs of Wallis Simpson, the future Duchess of Windsor, who was accompanied to the studio by Edward, Prince of Wales at a time when the relationship was not mentioned in the British press. A hand-coloured image from this session would later appear on the cover of Time magazine, marking Wallis as \\"Woman of the Year\\". Wilding opened a second studio in New York City on 56th Street in 1937. The studio was designed in collaboration with her architect husband Rufus Leighton-Pearce. A further important series of Royal Sittings were also taken when Wilding was based in America. These were eventually followed by the famous Wilding portrait of the newly ascended Elizabeth II that was used for a series of definitive postage stamps of Great Britain used between 1952 and 1967, and a series of Canadian stamps in use from 1954 to 1962. A previous portrait sitting of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, wife of George VI, had turned into a double portrait of the royal couple and was adapted for the 1937 Coronation issue stamp. That portrait led to her being the first woman awarded a Royal Warrant to be the official photographer to a King and Queen at their coronation. An autobiography, In Pursuit of Perfection, was published in 1958. Portraits Besides members of the Royal family, Wilding photographed many famous people, including filmstars and celebrities of the 1920s and 1930s. Her sitters included: No√´l Coward, Jessie Matthews, Diana Wynyard, Harriet Cohen, Cecil Beaton, George Bernard Shaw, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, Anna May Wong, Aldous Huxley, Dame Gladys Cooper, Tallulah Bankhead, Helen Wills Moody, Raymond Massey, Maurice Chevalier, Nancy Astor, Diana Wynyard, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Barbara Hutton. In her New York studio she photographed Fannie Hurst and Gertrude Lawrence at the time of her appearance in Pygmalion. In the 1940s and 1950s her subjects included Dame Barbara Cartland, Ralph Hancock. Dame Daphne du Maurier, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Norman Hartnell, Harry Belafonte, Louis Jourdan, Yehudi Menuhin, Somerset Maugham, Yul Brynner and Claire Bloom. Wilding is also known for her pictorial style nude photographs which include the dancer Jacqes Cartier and the artist's model Rhoda Beasley, photographed shortly before her early death.

Raskova‚Äù Borisov Guards Bomber Regiment. She was active primarily on the 1st Baltic Front during World War II. On 18 August 1945 she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Early life Born in the village of Sharovka, (present-day Poltavsky District, Omsk Oblast in Siberia, Dolina was the eldest daughter of Ukrainian peasants. She had nine siblings. In 1934, after Mariya's father lost his leg in the Russian Civil War, the family moved back to Ukraine again. Because of her father's condition, Dolina had to provide for the whole family, consequently she left school and went to work in a factory. Despite her mother's opposition, Mariya trained at a flying club of the paramilitary Osoaviakhim and, in 1940, graduated from the Kherson Flying School, after which she entered the Engels Military Flying School. Before the German invasion of 22 June 1941, she worked as an instructor in flying clubs in Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv.  World War II  In July 1941, she started her military service. She initially flew the Polikarpov Po-2, liaising with infantry units. Later she became a crew member of a Petlyakov Pe-2 twin- engine, medium-range bomber, in the 587th Dive Bomber Regiment. Dolina, who admitted to being restless, nevertheless became a deputy squadron commander in her unit, which was later re-designated as the 125th ‚ÄúM.M. Raskova‚Äù Borisov Guards Dive Bomber Regiment. On 2 June 1943, Dolina's aircraft was hit by enemy anti-aircraft artillery over Kuban prior to reaching her target, disabling an engine and causing a fire. Dolina's fighter escort had disappeared while pursuing enemy fighters, yet she continued flying and made the scheduled bomb-drop. On the way back, with no fighter escort, her flight was attacked by six German fighters (two Fw 190s and four Bf 109s). Dolina's tail gunner shot down one Fw 190 and one Bf 109. Altogether, Mariya flew seventy-two missions bombing enemy ammunition depots, strongholds, tanks, artillery batteries, rail and water transports, and supporting Soviet ground troops.  Postwar life  After the war, Dolina continued to serve in the Soviet Air Force as deputy squadron commander of a bomber aviation regiment. She lived in the city of ≈†iauliai (now Lithuania) and then in Riga (now Latvia) where she worked in the Latvian Communist Party Central Committee until 1975. She was married twice, both times to former Soviet Air Forces mechanics. After her first husband died in 1972, she married another from her former regiment. On the 50th Anniversary of the end of World War II, Dolina was promoted to the rank of major by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma. Many other secondary schools and pioneer detachments were named after her. Dolina lived in Kiev from 1983 until her death on 3 March 2010 at the age of 87 and participated in the 2009 celebrations of Victory Day.GUARDS MAJOR MARIYA DOLINA by Henry Sakaida, soviet-awards.com (2002) Awards and honors * Hero of the Soviet Union (18 August 1945) * Order of Lenin (18 August 1945) * Two Orders of the Red Banner (1 July 1943 and 1 July 1944) * Order of the Patriotic War 1st class (11 March 1985) * campaign and service medals * Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky (14 October 1999) * Honorary Citizen of Kiev (2003) See also * List of female Heroes of the Soviet Union * 125th Guards Dive Bomber Regiment * Petlyakov Pe-2 References Bibliography    External links *GUARDS MAJOR MARIYA DOLINA by Henry Sakaida, soviet- awards.com (2002) *Mariya Ivanovna Dolina in the \\"Country Heroes\\" portal. *Dolina's award certificates Category:1922 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Soviet Air Force officers Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union Category:Night Witches aviators Category:Women air force personnel of the Soviet Union Category:Ukrainian women in World War II Category:Soviet women in World War II Category:Ukrainian aviators Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Medal \\"For Courage\\" (Russia) Category:People from Poltavsky District Category:Russian female aviators ","title":"Mariya Dolina"},{"id":"8094640","text":"Elijah Alfandari (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ú◊ô◊î◊ï ◊ê◊ú◊§◊†◊ì◊ê◊®◊ô) was a writer on matrimonial law, and rabbi at Constantinople in the latter half of the 18th and in the beginning of the 19th century.

The school is under the jurisdiction of the Greater Essex County District School Board, one of the four school boards in Windsor‚ÄìEssex. The school was named after Vincent Massey, the first Canadian-born Governor General of Canada. Currently, the school has a population of over 2000 students. The school offers both semestered and non-semestered courses. It is notable within Windsor for offering the enriched program. History The school was opened in the fall of 1960 under the name of Vincent Massey Collegiate Institute. The school was opened under the direction of the Windsor Suburban High School Board and the Windsor Board of Education. During the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Morris the Mustang, the school's mascot, would be paraded around South Windsor's Norfolk Street to celebrate the commencement of the football season. In the fall of 1966, a swimming pool, a second gym, a cafeteria, technical and business areas, the library and labs were opened to accommodate an increasing student population. Tennis courts were planned on the parcel of land that sits along Rankin Avenue, but neighbours complained about the project during the 1960s and the land is now used as a bus stop. During this time, the name \\"Collegiate Institute\\" was replaced by \\"Secondary School\\" to reflect the fact that Vincent Massey had become a fully composite school. Enrollment was so high at the school during the early 1960s ‚Äì peaking at over 2,200 students ‚Äì that a second high school was constructed in South Windsor. Opened in 1970, Centennial Secondary School created a new learning institution and lowered the enrollment numbers. In 1984, Vincent Massey became a magnet school for its enrichment programs in Mathematics, Science, English and French. By the 1980s, the demographics of South Windsor changed greatly and the baby boom population had moved on, leaving Massey with approximately 800 students. In September 1986, most students from Centennial Secondary School relocated to Vincent Massey after Centennial was chosen to be closed due to dwindling enrollment in both schools. Vincent Massey added Orange to its school colours in honour of Centennial, whose school colours were Black and Orange. Their sports teams were also known as the Mustangs. In 1998, Vincent Massey became a part of the Greater Essex County District School Board after the amalgamation of the Windsor Board of Education and the Essex County Board of Education. In 2000, Vincent Massey welcomed students from W. D. Lowe High School after it closed down in June of that year. From 2001 to 2006, Vincent Massey also admitted Grade 7 and 8 students within their own area of the school named Massey Elementary. Campus Located in the heart of the South Windsor neighbourhood, the campus sits on approximately five acres of land. The school's front doors are located along Liberty Street, while its rear is located near Norfolk Street. The rear of the campus features an athletic field and an oval track. The building itself has two gyms, a weight room, a new workout room, a library housed in a circular building, a moderately sized cafeteria, a wood shop, a metal shop, as well as several classrooms and offices for students and staff. In the spring and summer months of 2017, the cafeteria and the closed swimming pool were renovated into 6 new classrooms and a larger cafeteria to make room for the growing number of students. Academics In the Fraser Institute's 2014 Report Card on Ontario's Secondary Schools, Vincent Massey was ranked at 48 out 740 secondary schools in Ontario in terms of academic performance. In the same report card, Vincent Massey was the first place out of all secondary schools in Windsor and first in the Great-Essex County. Over the last five years, Massey had been ranked on average at 91 out of 691 in the Fraser Institute's report cards. Vincent Massey is one of the three schools within Windsor that offers the Advanced Placement program, commonly referred to as the Enriched program. Massey has been known for its very strong mathematics program and its excellent performance on University of Waterloo's CEMC-administered Pascal (9th Grade), Cayley (10th Grade), Fermat (11th grade) and Euclid (12th grade) mathematics contests, winning the team Champion for Euclid. It also competes in other Canadian and American mathematics competitions, such as the American Mathematics Competitions and the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME). Notable teachers Mathematics teacher Bruce White was one of the recipients of the 1993 Prime Minister's Awards for Teaching Excellence. The award, awarded by former Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, was presented to White by former Member of Parliament Herb Gray. White was also a recipient of the Edyth May Sliffe Award in 1993, 1999 and 2003. Mathematics teacher Christopher Ing, who is a former Massey student as well as former pupil of Bruce White, was one of the recipients of the High School Sliffe Award in 2008. A computer science teacher, Ronald McKenzie, also received this award in 2009. Business teacher Ross Ferrara won an award of merit from the Ontario Business Educators' Association in 2010 for promoting and increasing awareness of business studies. Ferrara was also selected by the Ontario Ministry of Education, as the high school teachers representative, to the Financial Literacy Working Group. Athletics Massey boys player during 2014 playoffs Mustangs girls goalie in 2014 Vincent Massey has always had a very strong athletics program. All of Massey's teams are proud owners of many WECESSA, SWOSSA and OFSAA titles. Baseball The Boys Baseball Team won the 2010 OFSAA Championship, beating St. Anne 4 to 3. Basketball In the 1987‚Äì88 season, the Senior Boys Basketball Team went undefeated during the regular season, only to lose a playoff game later. Cross Country The school has been doing extremely well with the Senior Boys Team winning the OFSAA championship from 2007 to 2009. Also in 2010 both the senior boys and senior girls teams won OFSAA which no other school has ever done before. As of the 2015‚Äì16 season Massey has won a total of 11 consecutive WECSSAA Cross Country Championship titles. Football In both the 1986‚Äì87 and the 1987‚Äì88 seasons, the Senior Boys Football Team won back to back city championship in the Newman conference (the Wilson Conference was for schools of smaller enrollment). In the 1988‚Äì89 season, the Senior Boys Football Team nearly got a \\"three-peat\\" but lost the city championship in an infamous triple over-time game when they missed a last minute field goal attempt. These teams were \\"co- coached\\" by both Brian Tayles (former head coach for the Centennial Cougars) and Godfrey Janisse (long time Massey Mustang head coach) with Tayles running the Offense and Janisse running defense and special teams. Incidentally, Janisse had previously coached Tayles when Tayles was in High School. In 1992, the Senior Boys Football team defeated the Brennan Cardinals to capture the city championship. The team was led by Windsor Hall of Fame coach Godfrey Janisse. The Junior Boys Football Team won the city championship in 1975, 1992, 1994 and 2004. In the 2008‚Äì09 and 2010‚Äì11 seasons, the Senior Boys Football Team won the city championship. The Senior Boys Football team won the Wilson Cup city championship in the 2013‚Äì14 season.https://publicboard.ca/schools/massey/News/Our%20Stories%202013-2014/Pages/Wilson- Sr.-Football-Conference-Champions.aspx Senior boys football team won 5 city championships during the 1970's. Soccer In the 1987‚Äì88 season, the Senior Girls Soccer Team won the city championship. In the 1987‚Äì88 season, the Senior Boys Soccer Team won the city and the Essex County championship, having the Brazilian exchange student Paulo Soares (nicknamed PIPO) as their international star. In the 1990‚Äì91 season, the Senior Boys Soccer Team again won the city championship in a dramatic penalty shootout against the Lowe Trojans. They later won the county championship. Swimming In the 1970s, Massey's swim team won many city and provincial championships. In 2009, the Massey Swim Team ranked 3rd in the province in men's events, and came 8th overall during the provincial championships. During the OFSAA championships, Massey grabbed Gold in men's 200 Medley Relay two years in a row, and Silver in the 200 Free Relay. Massey also captured two bronze medals in 50 Freestyle and 100 backstroke. Tennis In 2009, the Senior Boys Tennis Team won the Open Boys' Doubles Championship. In 2015, Massey's mixed doubles team won the Open Mixed Doubles Championship.http://www.ofsaa.on.ca/news/ofsaa-tennis- results-2015 Volleyball In the late 1980s, the Senior Girls Volleyball Teams were very strong. In the 2010 fall‚Äìwinter season, both Massey junior and senior girls volleyball teams were SWOSSAA champions. The senior girls team then competed in Toronto for OFSSAA.

Origin They are descended from Mahra bin Heydan bin 'Amr bin el-Hafi Quda'a bin Malik bin 'Amr bin Murra bin Zeyd bin Malik bin ·∏§imyar.. Which means Mahra son of Heydan son of 'Amr son of el-Hafi Quda'a son of Malik son of 'Amr son of Murra son of Zeyd son of Malik son of ·∏§imyar. Distribution The Mehri are one of the largest tribes in the Al Mahrah Governorate of Yemen and in the island of Socotra and Dhofar Governorate of Oman. Mehri group members are also found in other countries in the Arabian Peninsula, mainly Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Additionally, the Arab Salah clan of Al Mahrah tribe resides in the Somalia. According to Ethnologue, there are around 115,200 total Mehri speakers. Of those, 50,000 live in Yemen (2011), 50,800 in Oman (2000), and 14,400 in Kuwait (2000), and according to Saudi officials there are around 20,000 Mehri speakers in Saudi Arabia.http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/06/21/221859.html Language The Mehri speak the Mehri language as their native language. It belongs to the Modern South Arabian (MSA) subgroup of the Afroasiatic family's Semitic branch. Mehri is divided into two main dialects: Eastern Mehri (Mehriyot) and Western Mehri (Mehriyet). These idioms in turn have urban and Bedouin varieties. On the island of Socotra, the Mehri inhabitants speak the native Soqotri language of the Soqotri people. The Mehri language is most closely related to other Modern South Arabian languages, such as Bathari and Soqotri. These tongues collectively share many features with the Old South Arabian languages (Epigraphic South Arabian), as spoken by the ancient Sabaeans, Minaeans, and Qatabanians. Additionally, many Mehri in Yemen speak as a second language Arabic, which is also a Semitic language. Religion The Mehri are predominantly Muslims.

He ruled Malacca from 1459 to 1477. He ascended the throne after the death of his father, Muzaffar Shah. Expansions of Malaccan Empire Mansur Shah implemented a policy of expansionism during his rule. Many territories in Peninsular Malaysia and eastern Sumatra and the surrounding islands were under the control of Malacca during his rule such as Selangor, Bernam, Kampar, Siak, Manjung, Rupat, Singapore, and Bintan. Mansur Shah also ordered the attack of Pahang by Tun Perak, the Bendahara of Malacca, to secure the defense of Malacca on the east coast. Siantan and Inderagiri in Sumatra were also given to Malacca as dowry for his marriage to the princess of Majapahit. Marriage alliances Mansur Shah also used marriage alliances between princesses of Malacca and the rulers of conquered states to strengthen Malacca‚Äôs control over those states, such as marriage between the king of Siak to Mansur Shah's daughter, Princess Mahadewi. Such alliances was a factor in Islam's expansion in maritime Southeast Asia. According to historian Tom√© Pires Princess Hang Li Po, daughter of Ming Dynasty Emperor Yongle (1403-1424). is sent over with her big entourage to marry Sultan Mansur Shah. Princess Hang Li Po remain a mystery and myth because there isn't any record in the Ming Dynasty with the surname of Hang and a princess named Li Po. Emperor Yongle have only 5 princess, Princess Yong'an (Ê∞∏ÂÆâÂÖ¨‰∏ª; 1377 ‚Äì 1417), Princess Ancheng (ÂÆâÊàêÂÖ¨‰∏ª; 1384 ‚Äì 1443), Princess Yongping (Ê∞∏Âπ≥ÂÖ¨‰∏ª; 1379 ‚Äì 1444), Princess Xianning (Âí∏ÂØßÂÖ¨‰∏ª; 1385 ‚Äì 1440) and Princess Changning (Â∏∏ÂØßÂÖ¨‰∏ª; 1387 ‚Äì 1408). When Sultan Mansur in reigning power, at that time, the Emperor of MIng Dynasty is Emperor Yingzong (1457‚Äì1464) instead of Emperor Yongle. Princesses of conquered states were also married to the Sultan of Malaccan, such as Princess Wanang Seri of Pahang and Raden Galoh Candra Kirana. Economic policy Mansur Shah reduced taxes on trade items during his reign, which increased the interest of merchants in trading through Malacca. A preferential tariff system was introduced whereby a 6% tax was levied on the trade of merchants from west of Malacca, such as Arabia and India, and a 3% tax was levied on the trade of merchants‚Äô from Maritime Southeast Asia. Merchants from China, Japan and Java were not taxed at all. economic advantage of Malacca was the easy access to labourers. Spread of Islam Mansur Shah, who had an interest in Islam, encouraged scholarship in Islamic theological studies, and studied tasawuf himself. He studied under Maulana Abu Bakar, who brought the Ab Darul Manzum scriptures to Malacca. He ordered the translation of the scripture to Malay by Makhdum Patakan. Mansur Shah referred to scholars from Pasai on religious issues due to their expertise.

The concept is often much more pervasive, affecting school, work, and home life as well. The term \\"commitmentphobia\\" was coined in the popular self-help book Men Who Can't Love in 1987. Following criticism of the perceived sexist idea that only men were commitmentphobic, the authors provided a more gender balanced model of commitmentphobia in a later work, He's Scared, She's Scared (1995). When aversion to marriage involves fear it's called scottophobia.Kantha, Sachi Sri, and Saori Yamamoto. \\"Medical Aspects in Tackling Fertility Decline among Japanese.\\" International Medical Journal 22.6 (2015): 450-452 A hatred of marriage is called misogamy.Ben-Rafael, Eliezer, and Sasha Weitman. \\"The reconstitution of the family in the kibbutz.\\" European Journal of Sociology 25.01 (1984): 1-27. But lets not misunderstand, the difference between commitment and love. Its possible for someone to have love for their partner but still having problems with commitment.  Commitment  The state or quality of being dedicated to a cause, activity, etc. Commitment applies to many aspects of life including teams and work. Managing complex projects is not an easy task. When several people are working towards the same goal there must be a level of commitment given by every team member in order to achieve a desirable outcome. Traditionally it falls on the shoulders of the project manager to ensure any problems that may arise are addressed.  Fear of commitment in group situations   Ways to Improve/build commitment   1. Find the Desire behind the Fear.  2\\\\. Fulfill that Desire 3\\\\. Creating a Relationship that Fulfills that Desire Fears of commitment can harm any type of relationship whether that is with your significant other or can harm the workplace with your team at work. As you may know emotions reflects on others. So when in the workforce and you come to work with negative emotions it spreads throughout the entire workplace creating negative vibes influencing the work productivity. To influence better work productivity for not only you but your team its best to find your goals and desire in your workplace. Work hard on trying to achieve your goals at the best of your ability. With you just doing that you may find others who have the same intreats I you and want to achieve the goals as you. This would increase your network and relationships with others in your workplace. Its best to keep outside emotions outside of work and vice versa for anthinthing else this would set you to create wonderful relationships and achieving many goals at work. Building your commitment at Work # Ensuring team members feel valued # Volunteer involvement # Build clarity around roles and responsibilities # Foster a sense of Trust # Challenge your Team # Accepting failure # Accept creativity and ideas Criticism Besides the common criticisms of self-help, Harvard psychologist Deborah DePaulo has written books such as Singleism on the stigmatization of single people. The use of the term \\"fear\\" or \\"phobia\\" imparts an inherent linguistic bias. It recasts specific lifestyle decisions (such as bachelorhood vs. marriage, or a conscious decision to remain childfree by choice) implicitly as generalised, irrational phobias while failing to identify, describe or address an individual's specific motives. For instance, the men's rights movement, citing high divorce rates and expensive alimony and legal costs, would speak not in terms of fear of commitment but of marriage strike to reflect their position that non-marriage is an entirely valid, logical position based on rational consideration of the economic factors involved.

The organization was founded at the first National Indigenous Congress in 1982. History Spanish colonization involved the formalization of structures under the name of cabildos, with both pre-conquest and post-conquest features becoming local traditions. In the Andean highlands, many indigenous people lived essentially as peasants, and leftist as well as state organizations took an interest in incorporating indigenous peoples into peasant-sector organizations in the early and mid 20th century. One such organization was the National Association Of Campesino Users (ANUC). The incorporation of indigenous peoples of Colombia into regional and national organizations with a specifically indigenous character and agenda was carried out in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the Andean Department of Cauca, the Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC) was formed at the Torib√≠o Assembly in 1971. The highly organized CRIC served as something of a hub for indigenous organizing during the 1970s. In 1980, the first national encounter of indigenous organizations was held in Lomas de Hilarco, Tolima department. The encounter vocally opposed proposed changes to the national indigenous policy of the federal government, called for the respect of indigenous rights, and demanded the evolution and expansion of indigenous territories and the suspension and reversal of colonization within indigenous reserves. By this time, Regional Indigenous Councils existed in the departments of Vaup√©s, Vichada, Arhuaco, Choc√≥, and Tolima, as well as Cauca. an interim National Indigenous Coordination was created for coordination, and for the organization of a national assembly. The latter was held in Bosa, near Bogot√°, in 1982, and united more than 1500. The organization's initial goals were: * to work to see that the principles established by law 89 of 1890 were put into practice * to ensure the benefits of this law were authorized for all indigenous communities in the country through the creation and legalization of indigenous reserves In collaboration with the sympathetic Betancur administration, numerous indigenous reserves were titled, in which many new indigenous organizations were formed, resulting in a massive expansion of the national organization. In 2010, an international campaign was launched to expose the suffering of what ONIC describes as the \\"massive violations of their rights\\".http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/5628 These violations are caused by \\"the internal armed conflict in Colombia, the lack of social and differential policies on the part of the Colombian state for indigenous peoples, and the imposition of a devastating development model in indigenous territories.\\" The campaign was launched by two indigenous Colombian leaders on a European tour, and it is aimed at protecting at least eighteen tribes facing the ‚Äòimminent risk of extinction'.

Today, Cyril Camus - the fifth generation of the Camus family - heads the company which counts 500 employees in eight countries on three continents. Camus products are sold in most countries in the world, in almost every international airport and on board a large number of airlines. Five generations Jean-Baptiste Camus Jean-Baptiste Camus (1835‚Äì1901) started as an independent winegrower, distilling and selling his cognac to established cognac houses. In 1863 he decided to organize a consortium of producers to guarantee a consistent level of quality in terms of production and supplies of mature stocks of cognac, and founded ‚ÄòLa Grande Marque‚Äô as the brand under which to sell them. England was the first export market for La Grande Marque. To establish the principle that the Camus family must have total control of the process from the grape to the glass, Jean-Baptiste bought his partners‚Äô shares and created \\"Camus La Grande Marque\\". Edmond and Gaston Camus Jean-Baptiste's elder son, Edmond (1859‚Äì1933), entered the company in 1894 as Master Blender, helping his father with all aspects of production. Under his direction, Camus gained further recognition for the quality of its cognacs, and was among the first cognac houses to sell cognac in labelled bottles instead of barrels, helping to establish the brand name. He also developed sales on the French market. Edmond's younger brother, Gaston (1865‚Äì1945), joined the company in 1896 and devoted himself to export sales. He developed a business in Russia, where Camus became the official cognac of the Court of the last Tsar. Michel Camus Michel Camus (1911‚Äì1985) was only 21 when he joined the firm in 1932. He continued to build Camus' relationship with Russia, winning an exclusive spirits export and import contract between France and Russia in 1959. In the early 1960s he started doing business with American group DFS Galleria. He introduced a variety of gift presentations targeted at travellers, including items such as Limoges porcelain and Baccarat crystal decanters, and first promoted the superior Napol√©on quality in a signature frosted bottle. Jean- Paul Camus Jean-Paul Camus Born in 1945 and joining the company to help his father as Master Blender in 1977, Jean-Paul Camus bought new vineyards, distilleries and storage capacity, focussing mainly around the traditional family base in the Borderies growing area. He also pursued his father's commercial policy in duty-free, developing sales in airports and airlines in the Asia-Pacific region. Camus Napoleon was the best selling cognac of the 1980s, with annual profits of over $100 million thanks to the exclusive worldwide sales rights with Chuck Feeney through DFS Galleria. This became the most popular cognac in Japan. Cyril Camus Cyril Camus, born in 1971, completed a business degree at Babson College in the US before joining CAMUS as the company's Trade Relations Director in Beijing, China in 1994. He returned to Cognac in 1998 as Marketing Director, overseeing the creation of numerous new products for the duty-free market. He also developed the Company's signature Borderies XO, a pure Borderies blend from the family's own vineyards, and a new cognac from √éle de R√©.

Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that when the character of the governmental action is a permanent physical occupation of property, the government actions effects regulatory taking to the extent of the occupation, without regard to whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner.. In doing so, it established the permanent physical presence test for regulatory takings. Background Section 828 of the Executive Law of New York required certain property owners to permit installation and maintenance of certain cable television wires on their property. Jean Loretto owned a five-story apartment building located at 303 West 105th Street, New York City. Prior to Loretto's acquisition of the property, Manhattan Teleprompter installed cable television wires on Loretto's property pursuant to ¬ß 828 of the Executive Law. Procedural history Loretto, on behalf of all property owners so situated, sued Manhattan Teleprompter for trespass and‚Äîinsofar as Teleprompter relied on ¬ß 828‚Äîa taking without just compensation, and requested damages and injunctive relief; the City of New York intervened in the case. The New York Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and rendered summary judgment for Manhattan Teleprompter, finding that non-crossover installations constituted a taking for which just compensation is due, but here the law served a legitimate public purpose there is no significant economic impact on expectations of investors, rejecting the theory that physical presence is per se a taking. The judgment was affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals. Loretto petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari, which was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court. Arguments The Court addressed the issue of whether Manhattan Teleprompter's minor but permanent physical occupation of Loretto's property constitutes a physical taking of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth Amendment, as incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Loretto's argument Loretto argued that Manhattan Teleprompter's minor but permanent physical occupation of Loretto's property was a trespass. Since a statute made the trespass permissible, it constituted a \\"taking\\" of property for which just compensation was due. Manhattan Teleprompter's argument Manhattan Teleprompter claimed that their minor but permanent physical occupation of Plaintiff's property did not constitute a \\"taking\\" of property. Section 828 of the Executive Law applied only to rental property, and was simply a regulation on the permissible use of such rental property. New York had also effectively granted tenants the right to enjoy cable television, which is not in itself a taking. Additionally, they claimed that application of a per se rule would have dire consequences for regulation of landlord/tenant relationships. Holding The Court held that regardless of whether the action achieves an important public benefit or has only minimal economic impact on the owner, Manhattan Teleprompter's minor but permanent physical occupation of Loretto's property constituted a regulatory taking of property for which just compensation is due under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, reversing the judgment of the lower New York state courts. Writing for the majority, Justice Marshall argued that Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978) held that there is no set formula for finding a taking. He noted that the Court in Pumpelly v. Green Bay Company (1871) held that a physical presence with the effect of impairing property's usefulness is a taking. Recent cases focused on the importance of physical invasion as a taking. Justice Marshall noted that the right to exclude is one of the most essential \\"sticks in the bundle of rights\\" that are commonly characterized as property. Insofar as invasion exists, it destroys each of these rights (to possess, to use, and to dispose). The Court found that owners have an expectation of privacy, without invasion. In contrast to the dissent, Justice Marshall noted that a bright-line \\"invasion rule\\" avoids ambiguity as to both law and fact. He noted that contrary to the assertions of the Manhattan Teleprompter and co-defendants, a physical occupation of only rental property does not make this less of a taking, that the statute in question does not purport to give the tenant any additional rights, and that a ruling against Manhattan Teleprompter will not reverse the broad discretion the Court affords to states in regulating landlord/tenant relationships. Dissent Justice Blackmun, joined by Justice Brennan and Justice White, wrote a dissent arguing against an automatic rule to determine whether there is a taking, and objected to drawing an artificial distinction between temporary and permanent physical presence. Instead, there should be a multi- factor balancing test that considers: (1) whether the State has interfered in some minimal way with the use of space on her building and (2) the extent of the State's interference, and whether it is so severe as to constitute a compensable taking. Aftermath On remand, the New York Court of Appeals upheld the validity of the statutory provisions empowering the Commission on Cable Television to set compensation for the taking at $1. The Commission concluded that the property value would increase as a result of cable television access, and as such $1 would be sufficient compensation for the permanent intrusion.446 N.E.2d 428 (N.Y. 1983) Legacy This case established, for the first time (but purported to reestablish) that permanent physical presence constitutes a taking per se.

It appears on the L.A. Woman album released in 1971, the last album that lead singer Jim Morrison recorded with the band. Composition and recording The song was recorded on a four track tape machine; all the other songs on L.A. Woman were recorded on a professional-quality 8-channel recorder. As with the other songs on L.A. Woman, the album liner notes list the songwriters as the Doors; the performance rights organization ASCAP shows the writers as the individual Doors members. However, the music has also been attributed to keyboardist Ray Manzarek, which references Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53 during the organ solo, and the lyrics to Morrison, while he was at guitarist Robby Krieger's beach house. Interpretation Hyacinthus was a beautiful youth and lover of the Greek god Apollo. According to the myth, Apollo accidentally killed Hyacinthus in a discus throwing contest when the latter ran to catch Apollo's discus in an effort to impress the god. After the unfortunate death, Apollo refused to let Hades claim the youth. Rather, from Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created the hyacinth, a plant with a fragrant cluster of flowers. This interpretation of \\"Hyacinth House\\" is furthermore based on the song's lyrical reference to another Doors' song, \\"The End\\" (which itself includes the line \\"my only friend, the end\\"). The line \\"someone who doesn‚Äôt need me\\" refers to Morrison's troubles with Pamela Courson. According to Krieger the line \\"I see the bathroom is clear\\" referred to Morrison's friend Babe Hill leaving the bathroom so Morrision could use it. Krieger has also noted that the line \\"To please the lions\\" was inspired after Morrison was in Robby Krieger's house and saw a baby bobcat that he had. Reception \\"Hyacinth House\\" has received several comments by critics. In a PopMatters review of the 40th Anniversary edition of L.A. Woman, Nathan Wisnicki said that Morrison‚Äôs delivery of \\"Hyacinth House\\" \\"is a bit lethargic and flaccid, and there‚Äôs still some laughable lyricism.\\" The Doors FAQ author Richie Weidman, described it as \\"one of the strangest Doors' songs ever recorded.\\" Critic Ryan Leas of Stereogum, praised the song saying that is \\"secretly one of the Doors' finest songs\\" and that it \\"still fits into the universe of L.A. Woman.\\" Doors' drummer John Densmore described the song as one of Jim Morrison's \\"saddest songs\\".

Once used for farming, it has been converted into a holiday retreat, with the establishment of a pier and housing facilities. Access is via boat or helicopter, and the island is serviced by the French Island vehicular barge. It is currently a private residence, with plans to establish holiday cabins.  Environment  The island rises to about above sea level, has very fertile volcanic soil, and is covered mostly in native grass, with areas of native trees and shrubs, and a few large pine trees. There are a variety of bird species on and around the island, and the area off the north eastern coast provides a feeding ground for native swans and other birds when the tide is very low. The white-bellied sea eagle can be seen on the island at times, and nests on nearby French Island. The shoreline consists of pebblestone beach, with small areas of mangroves, sandstone, larger rocks, and some small areas of sand. There are a number of rock pools. The southern part of the island provides constant deep-water access and is close to a deep- water channel where various sea life is found. It provides direct access to Westernport Bay. There is also a small rocky peninsula on the south eastern corner of the island, with mangroves and grasses. This area becomes separated at high tide.  History  The island bears the remnants of a shipwreck on its western beach, believed to be the rescue boat off a German ship. A former owner crashed his airplane on French Island attempting to view Elizabeth Island, having recently purchased it in a bar.

As a result, this Area Center covers some of the most important and controversial regions - including North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Prior to the Center's formation, scholars originally received funding administered by Title VI of the US Department of Defense's National Defense Education Act. The University of Chicago did not form its center until 1965, well after the administration of funding was moved to the US Department of Education by President John F. Kennedy. This area center consistently ranks in the highest tier of those dealing with Middle Eastern studies in the United States according to US Department of Education and external reviews. In the most recent competition for Department of Education's Title VI funds in 2014, the Center was awarded both NRC (National Resource Center) and FLAS (Foreign Language and Area Studies) grants, which support courses, extracurricular programs, educational outreach, and graduate student fellowships. Center functions The primary function of the Center is to stimulate and coordinate research and teaching about the Middle East region across the University, regardless of discipline. This is accomplished informally in the social atmosphere of the Fazlur Rahman Common Room and in formal settings, such as the Center's lectures, conferences, symposia, and panel discussions. The Center also serves the general public by providing free educational resources and organizing professional development programs for local educators. Masters of arts program The Center administers a two-year terminal master's degree through either the Division of Humanities or the Division of Social Science, wherein a student may structure his or her own course of study in such areas as contemporary Middle Eastern studies, Middle Eastern history, Islamic studies, Islamic art and archaeology, and Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, or Turkic languages (Anatolian Turkish, Uzbek, Kazakh), and their accompanying literatures. With over fifty first- and second-year students across two academic tracks, the MA program is one of the largest of its kind in the United States. Additionally, the Center offers a series of joint Masters of Arts programs.

The song was featured on the soundtrack of the movie Happy Feet. It found moderate success internationally charting in various parts of Europe, topping the charts in Hungary and peaking at No. 6 in Australia. The single was used as the theme song for the second season of Germany's Next Topmodel. For the 2006 holiday season, Farrell's song \\"Christmas Everyday\\" was released on the Make-A-Wish Holiday CD sold at Bath & Body Works. In 2007 she recorded three songs \\"You'll be Sorry\\", \\"Can & Cannot Do\\" and \\"Stupid For You\\", however none were officially released as part of a CD or album. This was due to Gia Farrell leaving her label Atlantic Records because they did not release her album due to a change in internal staff and management. During this time in her early career, Gia had several managers and handlers including Doug Davis son of the legendary Clive Davis. After parting ways with Doug, Gia was forced to find new management. Gia's new manager was an unscrupulous individual who attempted to derail her career, steal her money and keep her in the dark. Unfortunately, he was successful at straining her relationship with her label. After a lengthy court battle and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, Gia won a court case against her manager and permanently parted ways with him. In April 2007 Farrell rode on the float for the opening parade celebration at the Cincinnati Reds opening day baseball game and sang the US National Anthem. In December 2008 Farrell left Atlantic Records. 2009‚Äì2011 In May 2009 she released a demo single \\"New Religion\\" which was accompanied with a music video. Gia began posting random YouTube videos of original and cover songs. her videos had reached 600,000+ views. In January 2011, Farrell joined Miranda Cosgrove on her tour to promote her debut album, Sparks Fly. In mid June 2011, Farrell joined in a cover for Adele's \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" with The All Ways band. She also appeared on the eleventh season of American Idol as Jeannie Bocchicchio but was unable to complete the season due to having been previously signed to Atlantic records.

The district was originally formed as a military district of the Russian Empire in 1864. In 1924 it was reformed in the Red Army. After the end of World War II the district was split into the Western and Eastern Siberian Military Districts. In 1956 the district was reformed. In 2010 it was divided between the two newly formed Central and Eastern Military Districts. History The Siberian Military District was originally formed in 1864, as the Western Siberian Military District, being one of the ten original military districts of the Russian Empire. It was renamed the Omsk Military District in 1882, until renamed again Western Siberian Military District in 1918-1919. The Siberian Military District was created in June 1924 with the consolidation of the Western, Central and Eastern Siberian Military Districts, which had become the Imperial Military Districts in the area. In June 1941 the District was host to the 24th Army, under Lieutenant General Stepan Kalinin, which comprised two Rifle Corps, the 52nd and 53rd.See Leo Niehorster, http://niehorster.org/012_ussr/41_oob/stavka-reserves/army_24.html and http://niehorster.org/012_ussr/41_oob/interior/_siberia.html The 52nd, with its headquarters in Novosibirsk along with the 133rd Rifle Division, additionally had the 166th Rifle Division at Barabinsk and the 178th Rifle Division at Omsk. The 53rd Rifle Corps at Krasnoyarsk, where the 119th Rifle Division was stationed, also included the 107th Rifle Division at Barnaul and the 91st Rifle Division at Achinsk. Among the many, many formations the district raised during the Second World War was the 75th Cavalry Division, formed in September and October 1941. Immediately after the end of World War II, on July 9, 1945, to facilitate the demobilisation process, the Siberian Military District was divided into the Western and Eastern Siberian Military Districts. *The Western Siberian Military District was headquartered at Novosibirsk, and created from HQ 8th Army, covered the Tyumen Oblast, the Omsk Oblast, Novosibirsk, the Tomsk Oblast, the Kemerovo Oblast and Altay. *The Eastern Siberian District was located at Irkutsk and created from HQ 50th Army. The Eastern Siberian District was disbanded in 1953 with its region being split between the Western Siberian District and the Transbaikal Military District. On January 4, 1956 the Western Siberian Military District was again renamed the Siberian Military District.http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/gkv/sibvo.htm In 1968 the 33rd Army Corps was transferred into the district from the Turkestan Military District, establishing its headquarters at Kemerovo. The 13th Motor Rifle Division at Biysk was assigned to it. Among the mobilisation divisions formed in the district from the late 1970s was the 167th Motor Rifle Division, whose equipment storage area was co-located with the barracks of the 13th MRD. The 242nd Motor Rifle Division was established at Abakan in 1972. In 1974 for their great contributions to the cause of strengthening the defence of the Soviet State and its armed protection, successes in combat and political training, the Transbaikal Military District was rewarded with the Order of Lenin, and the Siberian Military District with the Order of the Red Banner. In August 1992, the 21st Motor Rifle Division, withdrawn from the 2nd Guards Tank Army in East Germany, was moved to Omsk.Feskov et al. 2013, 396; Holm, 21st Taganrogskaya Motorised Rifle Division In 1998, seven years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the District as it is today was formed by the amalgamation of the previous Siberian and Transbaikal Military Districts, and on their merger gave up the vast Sakha Republic (or Yakutia) to the expanded Far Eastern Military District.

It is likely safe to assume that the 41st Army controls all the field formations of the previous Siberian Military District.

Sports, Ice Hockey and the Canucks The building became Vancouver's premier indoor sports facility in 1936 when the 10,500 seat Denman Arena burned to the ground and was not rebuilt. The arena had seating for 5,050 spectators for hockey and box lacrosse. Some of the other major spectator arenas in the area besides the Forum included the Kerrisdale Arena (Vancouver) and Queen's Park Arena (New Westminster). It hosted the Pacific Coast Hockey League's and Western Hockey League's Vancouver Canucks from 1945 to 1968. In 1968 The WHL Canucks moved to the newly completed Pacific Coliseum which was located close by on the PNE grounds (the N.H.L. version of the Vancouver Canucks started play in 1970). The Vancouver Burrards of the Intercity Lacrosse League later known as the Western Lacrosse Association played at the Forum from 1938 until 1949. The team left for Kerrisdale Arena for the 1950 season. The building was refurbished as a concert and exhibition space in the early 1980s. The hockey boards were removed to create more floor space. Much of the hockey seating remains however along with one of the original press boxes which is still in place. The ice plant has since been removed from the building. The various ice activities that used to take place in the Forum are now held in the Agrodome which is also located on the P.N.E. grounds next to the Pacific Coliseum. The Agrodome had a new separate ice plant installed when the move took place but now shares one with the Pacific Coliseum after the renovations that took place in that facility for the 2010 Vancouver/Whistler Olympic Winter Games. Roller Derby and Professional Wrestling have also been staged at the Forum at various times throughout its lifespan. Concerts It has hosted several concerts during its lifespan, before but mostly after the renovation. Jimmy Durante played in the Forum during the 1930s. Bing Crosby on the invitation of Vancouver boxer Jimmy McLarnin played a fundraiser for the Sunset Memorial Centre. Crosby staged his radio show in September 1948 in front of a crowd of 9,000 which was a record for the facility.The Chuck Davis History of Metropolitan Vancouver - p. 253 (Harbour Publishing) The PNE says Pink Floyd played the Forum, although the band's online record indicate five concerts at the neighbouring and smaller PNE Gardens between 1968 and 1974. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention played a concert on August 25, 1968. A recording of this concert was released in 2012,https://www.jambase.com/article/new-installment-frank-zappa-road-tapes- due-may titled Road Tapes, Venue#1. In the 1970s it hosted local acts like Prism in 1977 and Triumph in 1978. In the 1990s Big Audio Dynamite shared a bill with Public Image Ltd, Live, and Blind Melon on March 30, 1992. Nirvana played two sold out show's there on January 3 and 4, 1994. In one of the more infamous rock media interviews, Nardwuar interviewed Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love in the Forum dressing room.Narduwar vs. Kurt and Courtney - You Tube, 1994 Soundgarden, Rocket From the Crypt and Pond played the Forum. Since the early 2000s, the venue has become popular with alternative and independent bands.

The Four Lovers' achieved minor success before a name change to The Four Seasons in 1960. During those five years, group members also included Nicolas DeVito (vocals, electric bass), Hugh Garrity (vocals, guitar), Charles Calello (bass), Nick Massi (bass, vocals), Bob Gaudio (keyboards, vocals), and Philip Mongiovi (drums) History RCA, 1956-58 The Four Lovers big break came in early 1956 when backing up a female singer's audition for two New York record men. One of the two record men, Peter Paul, was suitably impressed enough to become their manager. A week later, they were themselves auditioning for RCA. RCA signed them up that day and the group selected a new name, The Four Lovers. The group that ended up recording as The Four Lovers was Frankie Valli (lead vocal, drums), Thomas DeVito (vocal, guitar), Philip Mongiovi (Drums), Henry Majewski (vocal, guitar) and Nicolas DeVito (vocal, bass).Walter Gollender,\\"The Four Lovers\\",Bim Bam Boom No.8,December 1972Ed Engel,\\"Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons\\",Time Barrier No.23,August 1977Rex Woodard,\\"Four Lovers\\",Goldmine No.73,June 1982Peter Grendysa,\\"The Four Lovers\\",liner notes,The Four Lovers,Bear Family Records BCD-15424,1989 The quartet released seven singles and one album under the Four Lovers name, with only their debut single, Otis Blackwell's \\"You're the Apple of My Eye\\" achieving significant national sales to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.Whitburn, Joel. Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1993, Billboard Publications 1994 The single got them their first national television appearance, on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956. RCA gave up on the Four Lovers when the group's fifth straight single failed to chart in 1957 and finally dropped the group from its label. The group promptly signed to Epic Records but was quickly dropped when its first single for the label also failed to chart. As a consequence, the discouraged group temporarily disbanded. Bob Crewe, 1958-60 In 1958, Valli met record producer Bob Crewe at a recording session, who signed the Four Lovers to a three-year artist contract. During this period, the reconstituted quartet had some significant personnel changes, as bassist/vocalist Nick DeVito left the group in 1958, to be replaced by Nick Massi for just a few months, then by bassist/arranger Charles Calello until 1960, and then by Massi again. Meanwhile, guitarist/vocalist Henry Majewski was replaced by Hugh Garrity for a few months in 1958, and then by keyboardist/guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Bob Gaudio in 1959. The Four Lovers worked steadily as session artists, primarily as background singers and background musicians, in addition to resuming their live performances in various clubs and lounges between New York City and Philadelphia)Jay Warner, American Singing Groups: A History from 1940 to Today (Hal Leonard Books, 2006) In addition, their contract with Crewe allowed them to record individually or collectively for Crewe's Peri Records -- which they did under more than a handful of \\"stage names\\".Bronson, Fred. The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, 3rd edition (Billboard Books, 1992) By the end of this contract, the Four Lovers had become a complete outfit with an \\"in-house\\" composer and an associated producer and arranger. They were no longer dependent on outside songwriters to provide them with hits. In mid-1960, as the contract was expiring, a failed audition at a New Jersey bowling establishment led to a handshake agreement between Valli and Gaudio that signified a change: the Four Lovers were no more, and The Four Seasons Partnership was founded. By the end of 1962, the quartet of Valli, Gaudio, Massi, and Tommy DeVito would have two singles reach the top spot on the Hot 100.Bronson, Fred.

This policy of the Byzantines was often used successfully in weakening their neighbours. When Murad II emerged as the winning successor to his father, he marched into Byzantine territory. The Turks had acquired their own cannon for the first time by the siege of 1422, \\"falcons\\", which were short but wide cannons.Stephen Turnbull, The Walls of Constantinople, AD 324‚Äì1453 , Osprey Publishing, . The two sides were evenly matched technologically, and the Turks had to build barricades \\"in order to receive‚Ä¶ the stones of the bombards.\\" Siege According to a Byzantine short chronicle compiled in , \\"on 10 June, Wednesday, at the fourth hour after midday, Mihaloƒülu attacked Constantinople\\", thus beginning the siege of the city. The eyewitness John Kananos describes how the vanguard under Mihaloƒülu ravaged the city's suburbs, before Murad himself arrived on 20 June with the main army and the siege engines, and the siege began in earnest. Murad was forced to lift the siege due to the rebellion of his younger brother, K√º√ß√ºk Mustafa, in Anatolia. This was supported with men by the Anatolian beyliks of Germiyan and Karaman, who feared a revival of Ottoman power, as well as, according to Doukas, money given by the Byzantine emperor. Mustafa was thus able to gather a significant army, and in late August or early September laid siege to the Ottoman capital, Bursa. Contemporary Byzantine tradition ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the Theotokos.  Aftermath  In spite of the Byzantine victory, the 'Empire' at this time had in fact been reduced to a few disconnected strips of land besides the city of Constantinople itself. It was also facing grave economic problems and severely lacked soldiers. Pius II promoted the affordable donation of cannon by European monarchs as a means of aid. Any new cannons after the 1422 siege were gifts from European states, and aside from these no other advances were made to the Byzantine arsenal. As such, the next Ottoman leader, Mehmed II, would be successful in 1453.  Traditions  Byzantine accounts attributed the lifting of the siege to an apparition of the Theotokos upon the city walls, which greatly inspired the defenders. John Kananos records that: Also in the same reference, the Turkish Army notes that they themselves even saw a woman in purple robes walking on the outer ramparts of the city.

Peregrine first appeared in Contest of Champions #1 and was created by Mark Gruenwald, Bill Mantlo, Steven Grant, John Romita Jr., and Pablo Marcos. Name The word \\"peregrine\\" does not mean \\"falcon\\" in French, making the name \\"Le Peregrine\\" quite odd to a French reader (the word does exist in French, though it is used to refer to the peregrine saltbush, or Atriplex suberecta and not any species of birds); in French translations of comics featuring the character, his name was changed to \\"Le Faucon P√®lerin\\", meaning \\"The Peregrine Falcon\\".Le Tournoi des champions, French translation of Contest of Champions, √©ditions Lug, 1982 Faucon-p√©r√©grin does exist in French as an alternate name for the bird, but is now infrequently used.Dictionnaire universel fran√ßois et latin, contenant la signification et la d√©finition tant des mots de l'une et de l'autre langue Latin-French dictionary, 1743 Adding \\"Le\\" in front of Peregrine does not make it French as Peregrine is not a French word. The proper use should either be \\"The Peregrine\\" or \\"Le P√®lerin\\". Fictional character biography Alain Racine was born in Moulins, France. He is a writer by profession, but is a superhero, adventurer, and mercenary, using a falcon-like costume with artificial wings giving him the ability to fly. Peregrine was first seen in the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions against Death for the life of the Collector. He was chosen to compete on the Grandmaster's side, in the illustrious company of other heroes such as Captain America, Captain Britain, Wolverine, Daredevil, She-Hulk, and the Thing. He was pitted against another winged opponent, the Angel, but the Angel's greater experience gave him the edge to defeat Le Peregrine.Contest of Champions #1, 3 Later, back on Earth, Peregrine encountered Silver Sable, who invited him to become her freelance operative in France. He assisted the archer Hawkeye in destroying a nuclear warhead generator stolen by the Red Skull, and freeing the Sandman‚Äîanother of Silver Sable's operatives ‚Äî in the process.Solo Avengers #6 He accepted an assignment from Silver Sable International to disable a surveillance station in the Persian Gulf. He maneuvered the American navy into destroying the station, and blew up a Stane International tanker.Marvel Comics Presents #51 Later, Peregrine was compelled by Brain Drain's psionic powers to battle Sasquatch, but was defeated by Sasquatch.Alpha Flight #108 During the superhero Civil War, Peregrine was protecting France's borders from refugee U.S. superhumans fleeing the Superhuman Registration Act. Likewise, he is seen protecting France alongside Micromax from Kang's armies during the Kang War.The Avengers #46 During the Fear Itself storyline, Peregrine flies Black Widow into France when she is sent there on a mission by Captain Steve Rogers. When Black Widow uncovers civilians taken hostage by Rapido in a cathedral, she has Peregrine help free them while she deals with Rapido. During the Secret Empire storyline, Peregrine appears as a member of the Champions of Europe alongside Ares, Captain Britain, Excalibur, Guillotine, and Outlaw.U.S.Avengers #7 With help from Squirrel Girl and Enigma, the Champions of Europe manage to liberate Paris, France from Hydra forces.U.S.Avengers #8-9 Powers and abilities Peregrine is an athletic man with a gifted intelligence but possesses no superhuman powers. He is a talented writer, and a master of savate (French kick-boxing). Peregrine wears a suit of synthetic stretch fabric that incorporates an anti-gravity generator system which emits and controls anti-gravitons, enabling him to counteract gravitational attraction. He wears glider-wings that contain small hydrazine and nitrous oxide-fueled jet turbines that afford propulsion. Using all this equipment allows Peregrine to fly with a range of about before exhausting his fuel supply. He wears goggles to protect his eyes while in flight, and carries radar detection devices. While working as part of the Wild Pack, Silver Sable International supplied Peregrine with special weaponry including ammonium bromide gas grenades (to induce unconsciousness), napalm bolas, taser darts, thermite grenades, and an electromagnetic scrambler.

Biographical highlights Morales, of Mexican descent, spent his early life in Phoenix, Arizona, and attended school at Arizona State College in Tempe (now Arizona State University) and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles before joining the Army in 1946. He served in the 82nd Airborne, and was recruited into US Army intelligence during that time.Fonzi, Gaeton. The Last Investigation, (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), p. 382. Morales maintained an Army 'cover' even after joining the Central Intelligence Agency in 1951. Shortly after joining the CIA, Morales became an operative for the CIA's Directorate for Plans. It is alleged that he was involved in Executive Action, a series of projects designed to kill foreign leaders deemed unfriendly to the United States. Morales reportedly was involved in Operation PBSuccess, the CIA covert operation that overthrew the democratically elected President of Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz Guzm√°n.Fonzi, Gaeton. The Last Investigation, (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), p. 382-3. Through the 1960s and mid-1970s, Morales was involved at top levels in a variety of covert projects, including JMWAVE, the ZRRIFLE plot to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Bay of Pigs Invasion operation, the CIA's secret war in Laos, the capture of Che Guevara, and the overthrow of Salvador Allende. He came into contact with undercover operative Frank Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt during this time, and met with them for an operation which more than likely involved the assassination of John F. Kennedy Allegations of involvement with the Kennedy assassinations John F. Kennedy After the death of E. Howard Hunt in 2007, John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. In the April 5, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, John Hunt detailed a number of individuals implicated by his father including Morales, as well as Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Atlee Phillips, Frank Sturgis, William Harvey and an assassin he termed \\"French gunman grassy knoll\\" who some presume was Lucien Sarti. The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, \\"American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond\\", to avoid possible perjury charges. According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain. Robert F. Kennedy In November 2006, BBC Television's Newsnight aired a twelve-minute screening of Shane O'Sullivan's documentary RFK Must Die. O'Sullivan stated that while researching a screenplay based on the Manchurian candidate theory for the assassination of Robert Kennedy, he \\"uncovered new video and photographic evidence suggesting that three senior CIA operatives were behind the killing\\". He claimed that three men seen in video and photographs of the Ambassador Hotel immediately before and after the assassination were positively identified as CIA operatives Gordon Campbell, George Joannides, and Morales. Several people who had known Morales, including family members, were adamant that he was not the man who O'Sullivan said was Morales. After O'Sullivan published his book, assassination researchers Jefferson Morley and David Talbot also discovered that Campbell had died of a heart attack in 1962, six years prior to the assassination of Kennedy. In response, O'Sullivan stated that the man on the video may have used Campbell's name as an alias. He then took his identifications to the Los Angeles Police Department whose files showed the men he identified as Campbell and Joannides to be Michael Roman and Frank Owens, two Bulova sales managers attending the company's convention in the Ambassador. O'Sullivan stood by his allegations stating that the Bulova watch company was a \\"well-known CIA cover\\".

The story takes place in Japan. The plot revolves around teenagers being converted to followers of the \\"Diabolo\\" by a secret society in exchange for the fulfillment of their wishes. Teens who have made a pact with the Devil begin to go crazy at age 17, often manifesting in acts of brutality and homicide, and upon turning 18 reach a point of no return to their original selves. The phenomenon is a mystery to the adult world and media, who try to ascertain the origin of mass teen violence. There are six great spirits (also teenagers) that serve the Devil, each of which has a hand in destroying the world. The main characters, Ren and Rai, use their own Devil-given powers to stop them while searching for their cousin Mio, saving other teenagers from their pacts, and racing against their approaching 18th birthdays. It describes its plot as \\"The age where the ensured bend to temptation and slowly fall from human to devil.\\" It is published in French by Soleil,http://www.soleilmanga.com/manga-216.htm and was published in English by Tokyopop.https://web.archive.org/web/20080113212003/http://www.tokyopop.com/product/1331/Diabolo/1 Characters Main characters ;Rai :An orphan who became friends with Ren as a young child. On his seventeenth birthday he gained the power of \\"Ultimate Defense,\\" making him invulnerable to any attack. After that, he left the orphanage to find Ren, confronting him with the knowledge of their pact with the Diabolo (memories which Ren had suppressed) and the hope that Mio might still be alive. Later, Rai (who has become one with the demon Nebiros) reveals his secret obsession, jealousy, and love-hate relationship with Ren, who had been oblivious to these feelings all along. Rai is the more serious and solemn of the pair, though he does conceal many of his true feelings with a smile. ;Ren :Rai's best friend. Through his deal with the Diabolo, he gained the power of \\"Ultimate Offense,\\" making him capable of, among other things, exploding glass bottles with just an accidental touch and creating huge holes in walls with one punch. This leads him to be very fearful of what his power can do to normal humans, causing him to only use it to save and kill the people that have fallen. Soon after Rai found him, Ren's mother went insane, trying to force Ren to sleep with her, and upon his refusal, set herself and their house on fire. After this, Ren decides to join forces with Rai to try to save others from falling to the Diabolo. Despite his extremely tragic life, Ren usually tries to find a way to be as happy as possible, providing comic relief with his naivety and ineptitude with technology. Side characters ;Mio :Ren's cousin, who disappeared when she was seven after Ren and Rai made a pact with the Devil to be strong for her safety. Though her body was never found, Ren and Rai were accused of killing her. Ren and Rai believe Mio is still alive and spend the series trying to find her. Eventually Mio is revealed to be alive and retains her childhood form. It is revealed that she is the mastermind behind the entire story. Betrayed by the ones who were supposed love her, she accepted that her parents had given up on her. However, her dying wish was to devoid anyone of happiness and \\"break\\" the world. Although she was sacrificed, she was chosen by the devil and became Diabolo. ;Hiromi :A girl Rai and Ren \\"saved,\\" helping her to see the truth about the Diabolo after she sold her soul for beauty. She drops out of school and isolates herself in her apartment with her mother, trying to help Ren and Rai defeat the Diabolo using information garnered from chatroom and the internet. She appears to be a hikikomori, or at least have hikikomori tendencies. After fending off her crazed mother's attacked and killing her, Hiromi manages to alert the police to the location of the final confrontation. She also seems to have a hand in Lucifuge Rofocale's death, appearing before his true form. She is presumed to have died in her mother's lap. Six Great Spirits All six of the Great Spirits' names are taken directly from the hierarchy of hell as listed in The Grand Grimoire. They are teenagers who have adopted the names of the Great Spirits following their pacts with Diabolo and the acquisition of their powers. They are the primary antagonists for Ren and Rai. ;Agliarept :Known as \\"The General\\", he has the ability to read minds, discover all secrets, and claims to heal in his sleep. His real name is Kyouya. He acts like a delinquent and robs people of their money. After encountering Ren and Rai, he grows to be envious of their deep friendship and wishes he had met them before he had fallen. Despite his rather prickly, cynical personality, Kyouya has a soft side as well, evident through him taking care of Ren after he becomes wounded. During their fight, Kyouya willingly gets defeated so that Ren can save Rai. Kyouya reveals to Ren that he's the bastard son of a wealthy, dead businessman and his mistress and left home after his relatives found out about his terminal illness. His true reason for joining Diabolo is due to his terminal illness, revealing his desire to take down the world that lets him rot. He and Fleurety seem to care for each other. Though his powers are gone, Kyouya appears to be alive and well at the end of the story. ;Satanachia :Due to his beauty, he has the ability to enslave all and manipulate them at will, alive or dead. His real name is Rei. Rei is an abandoned child, and has lived in hospitals most of his life. It is alluded to that he was molested and possibly raped due to his beauty. Childlike and cheerful, with a dangerous lust for blood, his sadistic nature is quickly exposed when he murders an entire hospital ward. Rei claims to be the most sinless of the Spirits. The exact reason he fell to the Devil is unclear, but Nana admits to being the one that introduced him to the Diabolo. Rei is ultimately killed when Nana crushes his heart as an act of friendship to prevent him from committing any more acts of sin. ;Fleurety :Known as \\"Lieutenant Commander\\", Fleurety is the \\"Queen of the Night\\" and invulnerable when night falls. Her real name is Tsukiko (\\"moon child\\"), and is a pun on her abilities. In her mid-teens, she was the victim of a family suicide, after her father lost his job and killed everyone. She survived with a huge scar across her chest only to become the victim to her uncle's sexual abuse. Because of these childhood traumas, she developed dissociative identity disorder. Ren fully understand how she feels because of their similar childhood and comforts her. Her reason for joining Diabolo is to obtain invulnerability during the night. Her powers include the ability to absorb other's powers, such as when she used Kyouya's swordsmanship and soul-reading to fight Ren. Like Kyouya, she is alive and well at the end of the story although her powers are gone. ;Sargatanas :Known as the \\"Brigadier Major\\" and \\"Spirit of the Wind\\", Sargatanas can travel freely between dimensions. Her real name is Nana. Nana is homeless and crossdresses at night to prevent being taken advantage of. She distrusts adults as they appear to be the reason for why she is homeless. After Rai sees through her disguise, Nana, realizing that Rai is a great guy, quickly falls in love with him. Nebiros uses this fact to his advantage and attempts to seduce her to do his bidding. Knowing that the real Rai would never seduce a woman he doesn't love, Nana saves Ren in hopes that he will be able to save the man she loves. She appears to be friends with Rei and acts as his guardian, eventually killing him as an act of friendship. Despite being heavily wounded by Nebiros, she saves Tsukiko also in the hopes that she will be able to stop Nebiros. Nana is presumed dead at the end of the story. ;Nebiros :The cruelest spirit that controls premonition and pain, Nebiros awakens in Rai in his 17th year. As Nebiros, Rai's personality completely changes to the extent that the other Spirits are overwhelmed by his cruelty after witnessing his massacre of the teenagers who came for salvation. The other Spirits fear Nebiros more so than Master and Nema and obey his orders willingly. It is later revealed that all the Spirits are sacrifices and Nebiros seeks to merge with Ren in order to survive. At the end of the story, Nebiros succeeds in merging with Ren but Ren maintains control of the body and kills Mio. A hint of Rai seems to leak through when he shows a pained expression right before he merges with Ren. Nebiros is presumed dead because Ren dies. ;Lucifuge Rofocale :He describes himself as an intelligent spirit with courage who controls all wealth and knowledge. His real name is Yuu. Yuu sends Hiromi valuable information about the Diabolo because of his crush on her, only to stab her in the back in the end, preventing her from sending information to Ren. Nema found him first of all the Spirits, and his real body is hidden away, unable to move. He sold his soul for a holographic body, which he uses like a normal one. Yuu is presumed to be killed by Hiromi. Reception Liana Cooper of Anime News Network criticised the first volume for being episodic. However she felt it started off \\"pretty exciting\\".

He is the third child and second son of President Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump. A fourth generation businessman (following his great-grandmother Elizabeth, grandfather Fred, and father), he is a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his older brother Donald Jr. He also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice. During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so. Early life Eric Trump was born in New York City and attended Trinity School. His parents divorced in 1992, when he was eight years old. As a young boy, Trump spent his summers in the Czech countryside near Zlin with his maternal grandparents. His grandfather, Milos Zelnicek, who died in 1990, was an engineer; his grandmother, Maria, was a worker in a shoe factory. His grandfather taught Trump how to hunt and fish. In 2002, he graduated from the Hill School. He graduated with a degree in finance and management from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Trump started accompanying his father to job sites and negotiations from a young age. According to Eric Trump, in his youth he mowed lawns, laid tile, and did other work on his father's properties. Trump briefly considered other careers but decided to join the family business while he was a high school student. Career The Trump Organization Eric Trump, c. 2009 Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions of the Trump Organization. He worked with his sister, Ivanka, to redesign and renovate Trump National Doral and its Blue Monster course in Miami, Florida. In 2013, Trump received Wine Enthusiast Magazines \\"Rising Star of the Year\\" Award. Amid the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal‚Äîwhere President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter‚ÄîEric Trump strongly criticized Hunter, accusing him of nepotism. Eric claimed that, unlike Hunter, \\"When my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals.\\" However, when Donald Trump became president, rather than place his assets in a blind trust, he made Eric a top executive in the family business, which continues to operate and promote deals across the world. PolitiFact and the Washington Post fact-checker rated Eric Trump's assertion that the Trump family \\"got out of all international business\\" as false. PolitiFact noted that not only has the Trump family engaged in international business dealings since Trump became president, but that some of the Trump children, including Eric, have openly celebrated their international business activities during that time. In October 2019, Eric Trump complained about the Bidens, \\"Why is it that every family goes into politics and enriches themselves?\\" Shortly before he made that statement, President Trump had decided that the G-7 summit would be held at the Trump Doral resort, which was owned by the Trump family business. President Trump reversed his decision amid bipartisan condemnation from Republicans and Democrats. Television He was a boardroom judge on his father's reality television series The Apprentice (2010‚Äì2015). He appeared in 23 episodes. The Eric Trump Foundation In 2007, Eric Trump established the Eric Trump Foundation, a public charity which raised money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee. On November 30, 2012, the foundation committed to raising $20 million over a ten-year period for the naming rights to the new Eric Trump Foundation Surgery & ICU Center in the Kay Research and Care Center, a $198 million tower that was officially opened on February 19, 2015, on the St. Jude campus. St. Jude stated in 2013 that the 7th Annual Eric Trump Foundation Golf Invitational on September 9, 2013, at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff, New York, had \\"...raised 1.5 million for the kids of St. Jude\\", for a total of $6 million since 2006. On December 30, 2016, Richard C. Shadyac Jr., the president of the fundraising organization of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, wrote a letter to the Eric Trump Foundation stating that the foundation and \\"...related efforts, such as an Eric Trump Foundation-affiliated team that participates in the New York City Marathon\\", had raised $16.3 million for the hospital since the charity's inception ten years earlier. On December 21, 2016, Eric announced that he would stop active fundraising for the Eric Trump Foundation as of December 31. The move came to avoid the appearance that donors were using him to gain access to his father after he won the presidential election. The 2016 tax return, filed under the foundation's alternative name the Curetivity Foundation, shows that the contributions it received increased from $1.8 million in 2015 to $3.2 million in 2016. The foundation gave $2,910,000 in donations to St. Jude and several smaller donations to other charities while paying a total of $145,000 to various for-profit properties owned by the Trump family. Controversy about funds usage In 2016, the fundraising president of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital stated that the Eric Trump Foundation had raised and donated $16.3 million to the hospital since the charity's foundation. In June 2017, Forbes reported that the Eric Trump Foundation shifted money intended to go to cancer patients to the family's businesses. Eric Trump had asserted that his foundation got to use Trump Organization assets for free (\\"We get to use our assets 100% free of charge\\"), but that appears not to be the case. According to Forbes, more than $1.2 million of the donations went to the Trump Organization for the use of Trump's Westchester golf course and that \\"Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament.\\" According to a former member of the foundation's board of directors, \\"We did have to cover the expenses....The charity had grown so much that the Trump Organization couldn't absorb all of those costs anymore.\\" Forbes acknowledged that the charity has done a great deal of good, including an intensive-care unit that opened in 2015 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, as well as funding cancer research. According to Trump, the Foundation's expense ratio is 12.6%, and \\"at no time did the Trump Organization profit in any way from the foundation or any of its activities\\". Forbes also reported that more than $500,000 of the money donated for cancer patients \\"was re-donated to other charities, many of which were connected to Trump family members or interests, including at least four groups that subsequently paid to hold golf tournaments at Trump courses.\\" According to Forbes, \\"All of this seems to defy federal tax rules and state laws that ban self-dealing and misleading donors. It also raises larger questions about the Trump family dynamics and whether Eric and his brother, Don Jr., can be truly independent of their father.\\" The foundation says that relevant donors were informed that donations would be redirected. The Eric Trump Foundation has advertised that its golf charity events raised money exclusively for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, with 95‚Äì100% of the money raised going toward the charity. Public tax records show that the foundation applied significant amounts of the funds raised to pay costs of the events to the Trump Organization for use of its facilities. Additionally, the foundation donated to charitable causes other than St. Jude and made grants to several other charities, including at least three animal welfare organizations and the American Society for Enology and Viticulture, a California wine industry organization. Trump said in July 2016 that his father, Donald Trump, had made \\"hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal donations\\" to the Eric Trump Foundation in the past, but there is no evidence that the elder Trump gave donations on such a scale. When The Washington Post followed up for evidence, Trump appeared to backtrack and refused to give details. In June 2017, the New York State Attorney General's Office confirmed that it had begun an inquiry into the Eric Trump Foundation, based on issues raised by the Forbes investigation. The investigation was reported as ongoing in December 2018. Trump and his wife at a campaign event in 2016  Trump presidential campaigns  2016 presidential campaign Trump speaking at the 2016 RNC His father's 2016 presidential campaign was formally launched on June 16, 2015 at Trump Tower in New York City. He was a key advisor, fundraiser, and campaign surrogate during his father's successful run for the presidency. Trump and his wife made campaign appearances in numerous states on behalf of his father. On August 2, 2016, in a television appearance on CBS This Morning, Trump was asked to comment on his father's controversial statement to USA Today the previous day in which he said that if his daughter were ever subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace, he hoped she would find another company to work for or switch careers. Eric Trump said, \\"Ivanka is a strong, powerful woman; she wouldn't allow herself to be objected [recte subjected] to it.\\"  2020 presidential campaign  In May 2020, Trump said on Fox News that stay-at-home orders to combat the spread of the coronavirus were a deliberate strategy by the Democrats and the Biden campaign, intended to prevent his father's re-election by depriving him of the ability to conduct large campaign rallies. Trump said that after election day, \\"coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen.\\" In September 2020, Trump spread a false video which appeared to show Joe Biden \\"being caught red-handed using a teleprompter\\" when he was not. Big game hunting In 2010, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticized Trump, a big game hunter, for an African hunting trip he took with Donald Trump Jr., his older brother. PETA condemned the pair after photos showed the brothers on an organized safari in Zimbabwe, where their hunting targets included elephants and leopards. The director general of the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, V. Chandenga, issued an official response supporting the brothers and calling any allegations of illegality \\"baseless\\" and \\"false\\". Both brothers defended their safari via Twitter, affirming their actions as hunters and longtime advocates of the outdoors. Donald Trump also addressed the controversy, saying on TMZ that he fully supported his sons' actions. Personal life On July 4, 2013, Trump became engaged to his longtime girlfriend Lara Lea Yunaska, an associate producer on the syndicated television news program Inside Edition. They married on November 8, 2014, at Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. On September 12, 2017, the couple's first child, son Eric \\"Luke\\" Trump, was born. On August 19, 2019, Lara gave birth to daughter Carolina Dorothy Trump, the couple's second child. On September 29, 2020, he stated he is not part of the LGBT community, walking back a statement he had made earlier that same day indicating that he was.

He continued to teach and then became prefect in various colleges and at the same time prepared for the priesthood. In 1850, aged 26, he pronounced his first religious vows. He was ordained a priest on April 3, 1858, then continued as prefect and teacher. In 1858, on April 3, he was ordained a priest. He also supervised a club that cared for some 200 children from working-class families. He recounted his experience : > I've always had a love for the poor in my heart. Coming from a working-class > background, my parents were rural workers, I already had some inkling of it > ; however, I wasn't in the family home very much.

A simple man, he entered easily into contact with people, gained the trust of all by his kindness and understanding. He heard confessions, preached and visited the sick. Pernet felt more comfortable in his priestly ministry than at the college. More and more affected by the suffering and disarray of workers' families, especially when the mother of the family was ill, he felt an apostolic call. Founder It was in this context that in May 1864 he met two nurses who came to ask him find work for them and some months later met M. Antoinette Fage with whom he became the founder of the Congregation of the Little Sisters of the Assumption to create a religious congregation of nurses serving the sick poor. He settled successively in various temporary accommodations before establishing them in April 1870 in the 15th arrondissement at 57 rue Violet, which became the motherhouse of the new congregation. The first nuns took their vows in 1866. Their aim is to provide free care to the sick in their homes. Father Pernet was called as a theological expert at the Vatican Council I. During the War of 1870, he enlisted as a military chaplain. Taken in Metz for a spy, he was arrested by the Germans. Once liberated, he left for Mainz with the other French soldiers and then returned to Paris. He arrived there in March 1871 at the beginning of the events of the Paris Commune. Arrested by the Communards, he escaped execution thanks to a friend who had him released. He then went to Arras to take care of an orphanage. Back in Paris after the events, Father Pernet devoted himself fully to his foundation. He multiplied the creation of other establishments, first in Paris and the suburbs, then in the provinces with Perpignan in 1878, and in June 1880 set up an establishment in England, his first establishment abroad, east of London. He set up a foundation in the United States in 1891, then another in Rome in 1896, and met Pope Leo XIII in private audience on that occasion. In 1896, Fr Pernet sought approval from Rome for the congregation. The \\"brief laudation\\", the first official mark of approval of his work by Rome, was published on April 2, 1897. After a two-day illness, he died in Paris on Easter Monday, April 3, 1899, the anniversary of his priestly ordination. He is buried in the chapel of the mother house, rue Violet2.

It was first aired on September 24, 1972 and repeated on April 29, 1973. Like many other M*A*S*H episodes, this one parodies army bureaucracy. Thieves and blackmarketeers hold up a truck load of medical supplies for the 4077, thus rendering them in desperate need of Hydrocortisone. In retaliation, Hawkeye and Trapper meet with a notorious black marketeer, hoping to get some replacements. When they realize they have nothing reasonable to trade with him, they go to drastic measures to get what they need. Plot While operating on a general, Hawkeye discovers that the hospital is out of hydrocortisone. He and Trapper later learn that the hydrocortisone has been stolen by black marketeers, along with half of the other medical supplies and an entire replacement shipment. When they go to Henry's office to complain, they find him showing off a newly acquired, 100-year-old oak desk. Henry is too nervous to call General Hammond and demand action, so Hawkeye makes the call for him; however, Hammond refuses Henry's request for a fresh shipment. Radar puts the doctors in touch with a black marketeer, Charlie Lee, who asks $10,000 for a load of hydrocortisone he has in stock. The price is too high for Hawkeye and Trapper, so they offer to trade for Henry's desk. Charlie later visits the 4077th, dressed as a South Korean general, in order to examine the desk. He agrees to the trade, on the condition that the desk must be ready to load onto a truck early the next morning; if it is not, he will sell the hydrocortisone to another buyer. Radar wakes Hawkeye and Trapper an hour ahead of the pickup so they can sneak into Henry's office and get the desk. Hearing the noises of their attempt to move it, Frank and Margaret separately approach the office to investigate. Upon finding one another, they rendezvous in the supply tent and lock the office door, leaving Hawkeye and Trapper with no way out. As Radar tries to persuade Charlie's truck driver to wait, the doctors take down one wall of the office and carry the desk out. Before they can get it onto the truck, though, Frank recognizes the driver from Charlie's previous visit and orders him off the base. With the truck now gone, Hawkeye tells Radar to call in a chopper pilot, who airlifts the desk out of the office and flies away to deliver it to Charlie as a stunned Henry watches from the ground. Charlie, now dressed as a private, delivers the hydrocortisone as promised. Henry becomes suspicious, recognizing him as the visiting general, but Charlie only says, \\"You know how it is, Colonel. We all look alike.\\" Trivia * Assuming that this episode takes place in 1950 along with the pilot, there is an anachronism in the episode. Hydrocortisone was not introduced until 1952, so it would not have been in use at the time. * Possibly due to early concerns about scenes with the actors behind facemasks, both Hawkeye and Trapper are seen operating on a patient without masks.

It is situated in the Valley of Qadisha, which is considered a holy and spiritual place in Eastern Christianity The main religion of its residents is Maronite Catholicism. Kfarsghab is composed of two geographically separated settlements: Kfarsghab, a high mountain village, and Morh Kfarsghab, a plain village, respectively inhabited in summers and in winters. It is a typical organization of pastoral and agricultural Mediterranean communities where seasonal fixed transhumance is still practised.

Kfar Sghab: Village stays close to its expatriate sons and daughters - Residents are so close-knit they don't sell land to strangers, last retrieved on August 4, 2008.. Etymology The Semitic name of Kfarsghab is composed of two parts: kfar and sghab. The first part, kfar, comes from the Semitic root kpr which in the context corresponds to the common Semitic noun kapar that means village.The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000, we find the following entry: Semitic Roots, kpr - Definition: Common Semitic noun *kapar-, village. 1\\\\. Capernaum, from Hebrew kpar na√ªm, village of Nahum, from kpar, bound form of kpr, village (na√ªm, Nahum; see nm). 2\\\\. giaour, kaffir, Kaffir, from Arabic kfir, unbeliever, infidel (\\"villager\\"), from kafr, village, from Aramaic kapr, village. For the second part, sghab, it comes from the Semitic root sgb which means to make strong, safe. A second possibility could be the name of a person Segub.Strong's Hebrew/Greek Dictionary, entry 7682, ‚Äòsagab/saw-gab‚Äô: a primitive root; to be (causatively, make) lofty, especially inaccessible; by implication, safe, strong; used literally and figuratively --defend, exalt, be excellent, (be, set on) high, lofty, be safe, set up (on high), be too strong, and entry 7687, ‚Äòsguwb/seg-oob‚Äô: aloft; Segub, the name of two Israelites:--Segub. Given the above references, the etymological meaning of Kfarsghab could be \\"the fortified village\\" or \\"the village of Segub\\", Segub being a person name in this latter case. For the local people, Kfarsghab is referred to as ( ). The word is of Arabic origin and means the arid barren land. History The main entrance of Mar Awtel church built on the ruins of a pagan templeKfarsghab predates Christianity. However, like most villages in the Qadisha valley, Kfarsghab's history began with the settlement of the Maronites in Mount Lebanon during the 10th century. And until the middle of the 18th century Kfarsghab was a village of modest importance, with a total population not exceeding 150 inhabitants. Under the Mamluks The first mention of Kfarsghab in the writings of the Maronite Historians concerns events that happened in 1283 at the end of the Crusaders period.Douaihi, Es. (1984) : Tarikh Al Azminah, pages 261-262. In 1470 Kfarsghab is mentioned, in conjunction with the construction of Saint Awtel's Church.Abi Khattar, A., Moukhtasar Tarikh ... , page 139. In fact, the author refers this date to a text of the Patriarch El Douaihy, not present in the events of that year in Douaihi's most important book Tarikh Al Azminah. On the other hand, the historians (including A√ØnTourini) agree on saying that the construction of the church of Saint Awtel goes to the same period and on the same style as those of Saint Roumanos in Hadchit and another church in Madinat Al Ras (village now extinct). However the Patriarch El Douaihy dates the construction of Saint Roumanos church to the year 1518, El Douaihy, S.: Tarikh Al Azminah, page 397. Therefore, the first church of Saint Awtel could have been built at the end of the fifteenth century Under the Ottomans In the 16th century, Kfarsghab figured in the two Ottoman Censuses of 1519 and 1571.Khalifeh, I. K.: North Lebanon in the Sixteenth Century, pages 30-65. It is credited respectively with 14 and 12 male adults (of more than 15 years old), all Christians and married. And around 1600, the population of the neighboring village of Qaryat Moussa took refuge in Kfarsghab merging with the existing population after some unrecorded events obliged them to abandon their village.Abi Khattar, A.: Moukhtasar Tarikh Jabal‚Ä¶, page 65. According to the author, Bqoufa and by extension Qaryat Moussa disappeared because of very heavy snow seasons and political exactions At the beginning of the 17th century, the region of Kfarsghab witnessed an important migration to the more prosperous Southern Mount Lebanon under the stable rule of Emir Fakhreddine. Kfarsghab in the perspective of the Qadisha valley, engraving by Bartlett in 1838 The tragic end of the autonomous Emirate of Fakhreddine in 1635 threw Mount Lebanon in turmoil. The political void in the Kfarsghab region opened the way to bloody conflicts between local notables, accentuating the migration of a weary population. However, by the end of this century, new rulers from the Hamadeh family appointed by the Ottoman authorities succeeded in establishing a relative stability in the region and started re-populating the area encouraging the settlement of Christian families from their southern fiefdoms of Byblos and Batroun.Abi Khattar, A.: Moukhtasar Tarikh Jabal ‚Ä¶, pages 129‚Äì131. It is at the end of the 17th century that the families composing the modern Kfarsghab arrived in the region. The modern Kfarsghab foundation By the middle of the 18th century, the newly settled families started challenging the Hamadeh's rule and succeeded, along with other families in the region, around 1760 in ousting them out of the region.Abi Khattar, A.: Moukhtasar Tarikh Jabal ‚Ä¶, pages 136‚Äì137. The family of Abou Youssef Elias was appointed Sheikhs of Kfarsghab and of three other villages by the Ottoman authorities, a charge that the members of this family assumed for the next 100 years.Abi Khattar, A.: Moukhtasar Tarikh Jabal ‚Ä¶, page 132. The inscription on the main entrance of Mar Awtel church commemorating the extension of 1776Under the energetic rule of this family, Kfarsghab witnessed an important prosperity and demographic development driven by silkworm rearing and land acquisition.

Ehden & Kfarsghab seen from Bane in 1896 But the economic difficulties of the silk industry, the political situation of the new Mutassarifiah regime of Mount Lebanon (1865‚Äì1915) and changing conditions of the monk orders pushed the people of Kfarsghab to find new economic outlets by emigrating massively from 1885 onwards to the United States and Australia. It is estimated that Kfarsghab lost during the last 15 years of this century 20% of its population. Emigration was halted by the First World War, only to resume massively from 1925. The French Mandate and the formation of the modern Lebanon in 1925 did not curve down emigration. The demographic weakening continued all along the 20th century, especially during the Lebanese Civil war (1975‚Äì1990). Today around 20,000 people around the world are related to Kfarsghab by their origin, only 1,000 of them are living in the village. Geography Kfarsghab under snow in January 2004.

The revenues derived from agriculture would have been comfortable if, since the Seventies, the agriculture in Kfarsghab was not plagued by several problems. The main difficulties faced by agriculture are the lack of manpower due to emigration, the unfair competition of foreign products at lower dumped prices especially for olive oil,Fita page on Lebanon - Agriculture chapter, last accessed on August 6, 2008. apple diseases and parasites, the weakness of the Lebanese pound increasing the prices of fertilizers and pesticides, the closing of some important foreign outlets for Lebanese products like Iraq, the Lebanese Civil War.Countrystudies - U.S. Library of Congress, last accessed on August 6, 2008. Services Services in Kfarsghab are not developed at all: a small snack / restaurant, an internet-cafe, few shops, few local taxis and individual truck owners. All the existing services are mostly complementary business to the main agricultural activity. The few salaried people in teaching and in the regional services sector do not count on the salaries derived from their job to ensure a decent living. Construction sector Since the 1990s, the construction sector developed rapidly thanks to emigrants and residents building, extending or renovating their real estate properties. Several highly qualified individual contractors are found among the natives of Kfarsghab. Since 2005, this sector is facing some difficulties due to the general political situation of the country. Emigrants remittances and support Several welfare organizations founded by the emigrants support the infrastructure projects in Kfarsghab such as the public library, the public halls, the health center, the water supply, the roads, the churches and public buildings renovation.

It is still more intriguing for the local population. The popular tradition in Kfarsghab attributes its particular accent to the special characteristics of the drinking water. From sociological point of view, a major difference in accent between neighboring settlements denotes usually either geographical isolation, or an unconscious collective will of identity conservation. It is true that the winter village, Morh Kfarsghab, is relatively isolated but for the original village, Kfarsghab, which was used for the major part of the year, geography is not an evident reason. The explanation for the difference has to be found somewhere else. As to when this accent took its final shape, linguists do not have a model that estimates the period of time necessary to form an accent. Since the mid-1950s, emigration and education are contributing to the standardization of the original Kfarsghabian accent.

Located in Pizzofalcone in via Generale Parisi, 16, it was a place of high military and civilian training since its foundation, and had among its teachers and students the likes of Francesco de Sanctis, Mariano d'Ayala, Carlo Pisacane, Guglielmo Pepe, Enrico Cosenz and even a king of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele III, and a Viceroy of Italian East Africa, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta. Among the many alumni of prestige, high degrees of the Armed Forces, including one Director of the European Union Military Committee, two Chiefs of Defence Staff, four Army Chiefs of Staff, two Navy Chiefs of Staff, one Air Chief of Staff, two Commanders General of the Guardia di Finanza (and two Vicecommanders), two Commander General of the Carabinieri (and eight Vicecommanders) and two Directors-General of the Information Services need to be cited. As for the civilian alumni, three Prime Ministers, 14 Ministers, 13 senators and 11 deputies of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Kingdom of Italy and the Italian Republic, a President of the Constitutional Court, as well as representatives of absolute importance of the cultural, political and professional Italian and international landscape, including a winner of the prestigious Sonning Prize, awarded to the most important European intellectuals, have to be remembered. The flag of the school is decorated with a Gold Cross of Merit of the Carabinieri, and a Bronze Medal at the Valor of the Army. Its former students have earned 38 gold medals, 147 silver medals and 220 bronze medals for military valor; 1 gold medal for civil valor; and numerous other awards for valor. A total of 21 of them are decorated with the Military Order of Italy and 56 of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. For its role in the last three centuries \\"in the field of higher education, as a academic, social and economic motor for Italy and all the Mediterranean countries linked to it\\", on February 22, 2012 it was declared \\"Historical and cultural heritage of the Mediterranean countries\\" by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean. The School is also the winner of the Cypraea Prize for Science (1994) and the Mediterranean Award awarded by the Fondazione Mediterraneo (2012). History The originating military institutes The origins of the Nunziatella Military Academy should be traced back to the work of reorganization of the armed forces of the Kingdom of Naples, advocated by the statesman Bernardo Tanucci and implemented by Charles of Bourbon. Under his guidance was in fact identified for the first time the need to create ad- hoc institutions for the training of officers of various specialties: this initiative was necessary to free the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from subjection to the Kingdom of Spain, ruled by Philip V of Spain, father of Charles, and to limit the ambitions of his mother Elisabetta Farnese. Charles of Bourbon, King of Naples The initiative of Charles of Bourbon had its first result in the foundation of the Real Academia de los Guardias Estendartes de las Galeras (December 5, 1735), devoted to the training of naval officers: this institution, which has the primacy of the oldest Navy Academy in Italy, was initially housed in a building of the docks area in Naples, but then moved, after only two months, in the Palazzo Trotti, in the immediate vicinity of the royal palace of Naples and the Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit, in the area later occupied by the palace of the Prefecture. After a brief and not very profitable experience of a military school, located in the Maddalena town district, it was founded the Academy of Artillery (1745), for whose organization was called the mathematician Nicola Antonio De Martino, who was serving in Spain as Embassy secretary. The new Academy was installed in the Palace of Panatica, in Saint Lucia town district, and provided with a solid educational program, both theoretical and practical: there were, in fact, taught mathematics, physics, design and fencing, while the practical exercises were carried out at Molosiglio, in the docks area and at Fort Vigliena. The students were officers and cadets of the Academy of Artillery, for which attendance was mandatory; officers and cadets of other specialties, and noblemen who had passed an entrance examination were also admitted to the class. In accordance with the guidelines of the time, the programs of the Academy were specifically focused on math and science. The same Charles of Bourbon, in the ordnance for the establishment of the Academy, wrote: \\" Although we have with any of our other royal orders and instructions provided specially trained to make full use of our subjects sull'onorevole militia, although not of whereas in less expedient for the preservation of our states, the shine and the glory of our arms the body of the militia remains Yea well disciplined and educated in mathematics, science which mainly depend on the happiest success of the operations of the war, we moved to give even what the appropriate measure\\". Ferdinand IV of Bourbon, King of Naples The work of expansion of the educational foundation of the officers of the Army continued with the establishment of the Academy of the Corps of Military Engineers (1754), dedicated to the officers of Military Engineering. If on the one hand the foundation of the Academy added a new piece to the work to improve the preparation of military officers, on the other hand, made it clear the need for a single container that organically provided to this task . The departure of Charles for Spain, to ascend the throne of that kingdom after the death of Philip V, prevented him from continuing in his harmonizer plan, and therefore it became a responsibility of Tanucci to assist the young King Ferdinand IV of Bourbon in the progressive construction of a well-trained military ruling class. Vito Caravelli To this end, in December 1769, it was issued a new ordinance, which ordered the merging of the Royal Academy of Artillery with that of the Corps of Engineers in the Royal Military Academy. The new institute (also based in the Palace of Panatica) opened its doors on 1 February 1770, after an inauguration ceremony marked by a speech by Captain Alonzo Nini. The organization of the institute, which had an initial budget of two thousand ducats a year, was similar to that of a university, as students went there only for classes and exams. Courses lasted four years, and attendance was mandatory for officers of artillery and engineering based in Naples. The battalions of infantry, cavalry and dragoons stationed in Naples had also to send two officers and two cadets each, while the regiments allocated elsewhere sent two cadets each. The general of brigade Luca Ricci was appointed commander, while the direction of the studies was entrusted to the famous experimental physicist and mathematician Vito Caravelli. The students sustained two exams a year and one at the end of the four-year course, at the presence of the Minister of War. The top four performers were promoted to the immediately higher rank in the units to which they belonged, the second four received a gold medal, the other ones a silver one. Although the scheme of studies was thick from the point of view of science, it was completely lacking in the humanities, and such deficiency began to be acutely felt in the educational environment, and would lead to the subsequent evolution of the Royal Military Academy. Francesco Pignatelli, Prince of Strongoli Once it was provided to the training of the officers already in service, the work of reform turned to the cadets, i. e. the aspirant officers. To this end, and to establish a new unit that would serve \\"as a very keen tactical force in the most difficult war situations\\" it was established a Corps of Cadets, called the Battaglione Real Ferdinando (King Ferdinando Battaillon) (1772). The command of the Battalion, housed in two former convents of the Croce and Trinit√† di Palazzo (in the area now occupied by the palace of the Prince of Salerno, in the Piazza del Plebiscito) was entrusted to general Francesco Pignatelli, Prince of Strongoli, and Ferdinand IV of Bourbon himself wanted to acquire the rank of colonel. Students, sons of nobles and officers of rank higher than captain, were admitted at the age of eight, and continued their studies for six years, learning subjects like mathematics and military art. Once completed the entire course of studies with specialized institutes for the training of officers, from the rank of cadet to graduate school, it was considered appropriate to combine the different entities in a single entity. In September 1774, it was therefore decided to delete the Royal Academy, making its students merge with the Battaglione Real Ferdinando ones. The new institution that was so originated was called Reale Accademia del Battaglione Real Ferdinando (Royal Academy of the King Ferdinand Battalion), who from the original 270 cadets split into three companies, grew to 810, divided into nine companies. The students of the new Academy were distributed among the Palace of Panatica, where younger cadets were housed, and the aforementioned convents of the Croce and the Trinit√† di Palazzo, who housed all the others. Even the study programs were diversified in order to take account of differences in age and preparation, and for the first time the humanities were introduced for the younger cadets. The final exam was intended to verify that the aspirants to the rank of officer possessed \\"the extension of the theories of all the sciences that are necessary to know to comprehend the reason for what we do in the job for which you compete and theories of the same profession, the frankness of the intellectual faculties, which are well known for precise conduct cases in the data, and finally the degree of invention than is necessary to be able to find in the trade \\". The new institution quickly proved a valuable source of officers, prompting a growingly public appreciation by the king. However, in April 1755 the General Pignatelli was obliged to inform the king, with a wealth of evidence, the existence of a Masonic lodge among the students: this discovery was a source of deep conflict between Ferdinand IV and his wife Maria Carolina of Habsburg Alsace-Lorraine, which was notoriously protective of the Masonic movement in Naples. Consistent with the seriousness of the facts, serious measures were taken against those who were involved. Sir John Acton A new approach to training of officers happened after the dismissal of Tanucci, at the end of many years of service at the Bourbon court. The influence of Queen Maria Carolina was decisive for the arrival of the English admiral John Acton, who first assumed the post of Secretary of the Navy, and later, against the inertia of the Marquis della Sambuca, also that of prime minister. Acton began a process of renewal that would allow considerably strengthen the ethical and moral uprightness of the officers, so that they could function as an example for the rest of the population. Realising also the need to update the process of formation, consistently with the evolution of military doctrine, he was the architect of a historic decision: in fact, he constituted a small group of officers, which ordered to visit the military training institutions in the different European countries, and to draw from them all organizational and practical training aspects, which served to build an academy of a new kind. Also included in this group was a young lieutenant of Military Engineering Corps by the name of Giuseppe Parisi. This choice was particularly happy, because thanks to the detailed reports of Parisi before, and his work in person then, would be born the Nunziatella. During the period abroad, specifically in Austria, he was able to be appreciated by the Emperor Joseph II of Habsburg-Lorraine, as well as the Imperial Chancellor Anton Wenzel von Kaunitz-Rietberg, who often invited him to lunch with Pietro Metastasio. His ability to fit into the environment of the Austrian court led him to receive even the insistent invitation from the emperor to remain as War Major. Refused the assignment, Parisi returned to his homeland in 1785, where he was promoted to the rank of major and began to roll out the plan for the foundation of the new Academy. Far from being simply the local interpretation of the organization and methods of instruction observed abroad, the draft Parisi contained strong elements of originality, which would characterize the Nunziatella and would determine the uniqueness of the educational model. Unlike other military training institutions, it was held that the military training was strongly interconnected to the civilian one, so to lead to the formation not only of excellent officers, but also good citizens. The foundation Giuseppe Parisi In tracing the organization and curriculum of the new institution, Parisi proposed to abandon the old buildings and convents of the Panatica Palace where the cadets were housed until that moment, and to find a new home. The choice fell on the ancient Jesuit novitiate of Pizzofalcone, a large building that could be quickly adapted to the scope. The complex was built thanks to the generous donations of noblewomen Anna Mendoza, Marchioness della Valle and Countess of Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi,La Marquise, sister of the Jesuit Giovanni de Mendoza, made a donation of 24,666.66 ducats; of these, 8,000 were used for the purchase and adaptation of the existing building Polignano, and 16666.66 to the maintenance of novices.

Built in 1588, the church had been deeply remodeled in 1736 by the Ferdinando Sanfelice, which obliterated the original traits; and embellished with frescoes by Francesco De Mura, Paolo De Matteis, Ludovico Mazzanti and Pacecco De Rosa, as well as the splendid altar built by Giuseppe Sammartino.Sasso, p. 349Cate, p. 192\\"Naples and surrounding areas\\", p. 282, AA.VV. i A Nunziatella cadet (1787) The \\"Nunziatella\\" Military Academy was founded November 18, 1787 with the name of Royal Military Academy, by a special ordinance of king Ferdinand IV. This document contained guidelines for the education of the students, in particular calling on officers and instructors to attend to \\"... the knowledge of the temperaments, inclinations and aptitudes of the students in order to be able to stimulate curiosity and increase the attention, talents and faculties, and finally, instilling in them a capacity for judgment\\". Similarly, it was felt necessary to introduce students to \\"mathematics ... and to firm up philosophical reasoning in young people and prepare them for the professions of science and to train them in the consciousness of their duties and the social and political system.\\" The first commander-in-chief of the Academy was Domenico della Leonessa, Marquis of Supino, who by a decree of 28 May 1787 was appointed by Minister John Acton and promoted to Field Marshal.Bibliografiche Cards , Circle Youth, accessed 21 October 2013 Traditionally, however, the real flowering of Nunziatella is traced to the appointment in 1794 of Giuseppe Parisi as commander;Manufacturer, p. 1-50 the street where the school is located is still named after him. La Nunziatella fu presto riconosciuta come luogo di elevata formazione militare, gi√† pochi anni dopo la sua fondazione. A tal proposito, Giuseppe Maria Galanti scrisse nel 1792: The Neapolitan Republic (1799) Carlo Lauberg Soon a few years after its foundation, Nunziatella's history started to cross the landmark events that would have characterized the European scene in the last years of the 18th century. On July 14, 1789, the people of Paris assaulted the Bastille, thus starting the French Revolution, that would have caused the king and queen of France, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette to be beheaded.. These events, which marked the collapse of the Ancien R√©gime, could not be indifferent to the Neapolitan court, since Ferdinand IV was a member of the big royal family of Bourbons, while his wife Maria Carolina of Austria was Marie-Antoinette's sister.. The level of police awareness against Jacobins' activities sharply rose, while the latter increased their attempts to influence the Neapolitan Army's commanding personnel: their aim was, indeed, to make military to support a revolt and pull the king out of his throne for building a Republic like in France. Nunziatella was soon at the center of this attempt, since some of its professors, among the leaders of the Jacobin movement, tried to involve the young cadets into their Republican ideas. One of them, Annibale Giordano, had been arrested in the past in 1784, and deprived of his post of Chemistry teacher. The Maths teacher Carlo Lauberg and his colleagues Clino Roselli (fortifications teacher), Pasquale Baffi (Hellenist), Michele Granata (philosopher and mathematician) and Giustino Fortunato senior were all involved in the Jacobin movement, as members of the Societ√† Patriottica.. The rapid expansion of the French beyond national borders and in particular their penetration in the Italian peninsula, led in 1798 to the invasion of the Papal States, with the consequent removal and exile of Pope Pius VI. On November 28, the Neapolitan government moved in arms against the fledgling Roman Republic, defeating opponents and coming to the reconquest of Rome in six days. However, this victory was short-lived, since December 24, 1798, at the urging of the French troops commanded by General Jean Etienne Championnet, the Bourbon troops were beaten in the battle of Civita Castellana and forced to retreat to the capital. Overwhelmed by the pressure of events, King Ferdinand repaired by sea in Sicily, leaving to the regency of Francesco Pignatelli the administration of the continental territories of the Kingdom. In mid-January 1799 it was signed an armistice between the French troops and representatives of the government of Naples, that, however, was immediately rejected by \\"Lazzaroni\\" who found that a betrayal: this component of the Neapolitan people barricaded himself in defense of the city, by requisitioning the numerous weapons found in the city deposits. If virtually all military units allocated in Naples suffered the seizure of weapons, so it was not for the Nunziatella. The propaganda conducted by the Jacobins had found fertile ground in the young students, who at the outbreak of the riots took place in favor of the revolutionary movement in progress. Under the command of Captain Pasquale Galluzzo, they opposed a fierce resistance to the assault of lazzari and managed to scare them away. right The fierce resistance of lazzari, which fought fiercely against an enemy much better organized and armed, was broken only by the conquest of Castel Sant'Elmo to the French, that came through a betrayal; once seized the fort, built on the hill of the same name, it was, in fact, possible for attackers bombard the city and thus put an end to any attempt at defense. The French conquest led to the proclamation of the Neapolitan Republic, where many teachers of Nunziatella had leading roles: Carlo Lauberg was head of the government, while Annibale Giordano was assigned to the Military Committee and then head of the accounting of the Navy. Also several alumni played a leading role: Leopoldo De Renzis, a distant relative of Carlo Lauberg, and Gabriele Manthon√© were ministers of War and Navy, while notable roles were also Pietro Colletta, Guglielmo Pepe and Tommaso Susanna, who was part of the Government of the Republic as minister of war. The first Restoration (1800-1805) Reduced formally to male boarding school for orphans military (in fact they were really few), the Nunziatella regained the title of Royal Military Academy thanks to the work of its Commander, Captain Giuseppe Saverio Poli. On 1 December 1802 the new name became operational and Poli was promoted to lieutenant colonel in accordance with the new assignment. Two years later Poli managed to obtain the Nunziatella to be granted the status of \\"university\\", which opened the possibility reception of external students (elementary school children) to which he taught literature and mathematics, assisted by other officers and two Priests for the teaching of catechism. The presence at Nunziatella of Poli, a distinguished physicist and malacologist would become the tutor of Francis I of the Two Sicilies, was also important for the strong impetus given to the endowment of the Physics Laboratory. Partly borrowed from that of the old Battaglione Real Ferdinando, it was equipped with all the latest equipment, so as to make it \\"(that) more complete and respectable (...) in Naples\\". The French decade (1806-1815) Giuseppe Saverio Poli The conquest of the Kingdom by Napoleonic troops as part of the Austro-Neapolitan War, caused the loss of the rank and employment by Poli, who was reinstated at the end of 1810 with the rank of lieutenant and the appointment of library guardian. The captains employed to cadets' direction (Galileo Giuseppe Pasquali, Gaetano Ruiz, Andrea and Pasquale Galluzzo Colnago) maintained however rank and functions until 1812, when they were removed. The establishment of the new regime had resulted in the reorganization of the Neapolitan armed forces and the reform also involved training institutions. Consequently, the Nunziatella was hit by a decree of suppression as a military college; nevertheless it remained active in the building of Pizzofalcone as a school of theoretical and practical artillery, which served as a point of leverage for the reopening of the college. Interior Minister Andr√©-Fran√ßois Miot asked the inspector general of artillery Giuseppe Fonseca Chavez to submit a project dedicated to that end: the plan, presented May 10, 1806, proposed Nunziatella to be the only recruitment institute for the four Armies, like it was before 1799. Giuseppe Parisi himself wrote a project draft for Fonseca, proposing a \\"decree on the formation of the Military Academy.\\" Under the new system they would be admitted to the Nunziatella 160 students aged 11 to 14 and 60 day students 15 years of age. The management would be guaranteed by 62 employees (24 officers, three administrative, 2 priests, 4 health, 19 professors and 10 masters), waiters, sergeants, Trabants and 10 horses. A total of 50 among the students would be selected for the school of application of artillery and engineering. Nunziatella cadet (1805-1815) Parisi's proposal was seconded by the one prepared by Vito Caravelli, a former professor of Nunziatella, that through Parisi transmitted it to the minister of war Mathieu Dumas, establishing school programs for science, design, Italian, French, English and practical training. Accepted all suggestions, on the following 1 September Dumas wrote to Joseph Bonaparte, King of Naples, to propose \\"the temporary formation of a military school with 4/500 ducats per month, being only to pay the full wages of the professors of the ancient academy that (they were already) at half wage. \\" Dumas motivated further its proposal, emphasizing the need to train students for the armies of genius, artillery and Bridges' service and the opportunity offered from the building of the Nunziatella, which already housed a library and allowed the opening four days a week for both the French officers and the Neapolitans. The second Restoration (1816-1854) For Nunziatella the period of the Second Restoration was a time of great cultural fervor, thanks to the arrival of some of the most qualified teachers of the time. Mariano d'Ayala, then first lieutenant and former student of the Nunziatella until 1828, was called in September 1837 to hold the post of instructor of ballistic and descriptive geometry. Once in the chair in place of major Niola (later instructor Francis II of the Two Sicilies) and thanks to the protection of Carlo Filangieri, Ayala strived to transfer to cadets the ideas taught in other countries Europeans. Far from being a purely theoretical exercise, the action of Ayala also expressed by building a relationship of great closeness to his students. This had a profound influence on the students of the time (which included Carlo Pisacane, Enrico Cosenz, Giuseppe Virgili and Salvatore Medina), and was the channel through which Ayala transferred to them his own ideas about the necessity of Italian unification. The methods of teaching the young officer did not fail to worry the commander of the Nunziatella, major Michele Nocerino, who he reported to King Ferdinand II. When asking what happened, the king faced the defense of Filangieri, who convinced him not only to let go of Ayala in his work, but to accuse and to dismiss the commander Nocerino, who was succeeded by Colonel Francesco Antonio Winspeare. The work of Ayala continued for another four years after this incident, during which, in addition to continuing to propagate the unitaristic ideals among students, merited a note of praise for leading with skill drills to the field of Capua and published the famous \\"Lessons of artillery\\", that contained the most advanced notions of time in the field, dedicated \\"To the beloved students\\". Nunziatella cadets (1834) Ayala's career was cut short in 1843 by accident. In that year was published an issue of Iris, a publication which contained among others a paper by Basilio Puoti. This paper scandalized a princess because of his licentious character and she took the newspaper his father Ferdinand II because he intervened. Withholding the publication to become more aware of it, the kingalso read a paper by Ayala, who under the guise of a historical narrative concealed apology of Joachim Murat and his attempt to regain the Kingdom. Irritated and mindful of the warnings of the deposed captain Nocerino, Ferdinand II summoned Carlo Filangieri and this time attacked him and to notify that would remove the teacher. Attempts defense by Filangieri came to no avail, especially as its recommendation to Ayala to make amends and ask forgiveness of the king did not produce effect, as he preferred to resign on Aug. 3, 1843. Francesco De Sanctis, one of the most important figures of Italian literature, came to the Nunziatella as a professor of literature April 19, 1841, thanks to the influence of Basilio Puoti, who was inspector to studies. At that time the letters kept private courses of grammar and literature in Vico Bisi. The influence of De Sanctis was naturally great on young cadets, but this process was neither simple nor immediate, as in the early years of teaching, as reported by his student Nicola Marselli, De Sanctis was the laughing stock of his students. However, things changed thanks to the great teaching skills of De Sanctis, to the point that when he was teaching students from other classes came to hear. The 1848 riot 1848 was a pivotal year in the history of Europe, because, since the uprisings in Sicily in January, saw the beginning of the so-called \\"Spring of Nations\\". The revolt was soon extended to other parts of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies involving numerous members of the middle class and intellectuals. When in May 1848 Francesco De Sanctis took part in the riots, several students followed him; but after the failure of the revolutionary movement the professor was impeached and removed from teaching in November. Gave himself fled, was captured in Cosenza in December 1849 and sent to prison in Castel dell'Ovo, where he remained for three years. Other teachers of the Nunziatella, Enrico Alvino, Amante Fedele and Filippo Cassola, also participated in the riots of 1848. After the failure of the revolt, all three were removed from teaching. The transfer to Maddaloni (1855‚Äì1859) Carlo Pisacane The revolutionary movements of 1848 marked a break point in the policy of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and in particular on the training of managerial staff of the army. The attempt at revolution had in fact demonstrated how necessary to provide not only an appropriate number of officers to the Army, but also to prevent them, as usually volitional boys and sensitive to liberal propaganda, could be adversely affected by Piedmontese agents. For this reason and despite the opposition of the relatives of the students, most of whom resided in Naples, on April 27, 1855 resolved the transfer of the Nunziatella in Maddaloni, at the palace of the Dukes Carafa. This new location, in the intentions of the sovereign, would ensure the greater controllability of the students, thanks to the proximity of Maddaloni to the Royal Palace of Caserta. Officer and cadets of Nunziatella (1853) Exile in Maddaloni lasted until Ferdinand II was alive, while the ascent to the throne of Francis II of the Two Sicilies, of a completely different temperament than his father, offered the occasion to those who advocated the return of the institute in the capital to do another attempt. Carlo Filangieri, was among the leading opponents of the transfer of the Nunziatella in Maddaloni and was in the forefront in putting pressure on the young king because it would put an end to expulsion of the institute from Naples. Arguing that attempts of troublemakers were present in both big cities, and in small towns, Filangieri was finally able to get it to be a date for the return, decided to 7 September 1859. The news was received with great jubilation by students, and was even staged a comeback in solemn form, with celebratory banquets and thanksgiving masses. The news of such effusions of joy reached and upset the king, who was staying at the Royal Palace of Portici, urging him to send a telegram in the late afternoon of September 6, which canceled the transfer order. To the protests of Filangieri, Francis II replied with another telegram, in which he deplored the excessive displays of joy that were planned and ordered the postponement of the transfer. As per provisions of the King, the students spent the 7th on the road, having lunch at the Bridges of the Valley and returning to the city without further celebrations. In this period were some Nunziatella alumni played an important role in the history of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In particular, Giuseppe Ghio was in command of the troops who in 1857 stopped in Padula the revolutionist Carlo Pisacane, another Nunziatella former student. The ill-fated expedition of Pisacane, that the intention was supposed to trigger the uprising of Cilento, was the inspiration for the famous poem La spigolatrice di Sapri by Luigi Mercantini. The fall of the Two Sicilies (1860‚Äì1861) Events related to Mille expedition and the subsequent invasion of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies by the Armata Sarda saw former students of the Nunziatella on both sides of the battle. Among the protagonists of the Bourbon side, Ferdinando Beneventano del Bosco was engaged in fighting in Sicily subsequent to the landing of Garibaldi's troops. He engaged the enemy troops after the Battle of Calatafimi, forcing them to divert to Corleone before moving to Palermo. After the occupation of the latter by the Garibaldi troops, he launched an assault on the city, and he was stopped only by the news of the truce signed by Giuseppe Garibaldi with General Lanza. Then he held the fortress of Milazzo up to the order of capitulation, and later he fought during the Siege of Gaeta and led several legitimist attempts after the fall of the Two Sicilies. The aforementioned Giuseppe Ghio was responsible for the surrender without a fight of about 12,000 men of the Army of Two Sicilies in Soveria Mannelli. This episode, which opened the doors to Garibaldi in Naples, probably led him to be murdered there a few years later. Among the alumni on the Bourbon side which died during the invasion by Piedmont has to be remembered Brigadier Matteo Negri, which fell during the Battle of Garigliano and was buried with a solemn ceremony in Cathedral of Saints Erasmus and Marciano and Santa Maria Assunta by order of the king Francis II. While in command of its troops and although wounded several times, he continued to give orders and to encourage his men, until, after allowing for all Bourbon forces to cross the river in the direction of Gaeta, he died in his place. During the siege of Gaeta fell Lieutenant Colonel Paolo de Sangro Prince of Sansevero, grandson of Raimondo de Sangro: seriously injured following the explosion of the Cittadella battery, he died shortly after. In the same blast was also killed Lt. Gen. Francesco Traversa another Nunziatella alumnus. Also many students of Nunziatella left the School and participated in the fighting on the side of the Army of the Two Sicilies. Their presence on the front of the fire was a result of the events related to the departure of Francis II of Naples: the commander Muratti, immediately switched to the side of Garibaldi, and imposed the oath of allegiance to the students who wanted to remain in the institute. Among those who refused and fled the school they are to remember the brothers Antonio and Eduardo Rossi sixteen and fourteen years old, after remembered by the French journalist Charles Garnier for their heroic behavior; the seventeen-year-old son of Eliezer Nicoletti, son of Domenico (commanding officer of the 6th regiment of line \\"Farnese\\" that defeated the partisans of Pilade Bronzetti during battle of the Volturno). In September 1860 he went from Nunziatella first to Capua and then to Gaeta, where he participated in the defense of the fortress as a standard bearer of artillery; Ludovico Manzi of seventeen and nineteen Ferdinand de Liguori, son of the colonel the 9th Puglia; Alfonso Scotti Douglas eleven-year-old son of General Luigi Scotti Douglas, who participated in the work of the genius in the fortress of Capua; Francesco and Felice Afan de Rivera, fifteen and sixteen years of age (children of the General Gaetano Afan de Rivera, and descendants of viceroy of Naples Af√°n Fernando de Ribera), they reached their older brothers in the siege of Capua; Francesco Pons de Leon, eighteen, reached in Gaeta his father a Major of the Army, and served as artillery servant; Fernando Ruiz, seventeen, grandson of General Peter Vial and acquired grandson by Ludovico Quandel, arrived in Gaeta in early January 1861, after overcoming great difficulties for the ongoing clashes; Ferdinando and Manfredi Lanza, fifteen and sixteen year-old children of an officer of Engineers, the first of whom lost a foot during the last day of the siege; and finally the ensign Carlo Giordano, seventeen and orphaned a few months before of the father general, who fled from the Nunziatella on October 10, was artillery servant at battery Malpasso and was killed in the outbreak of Battery Transylvania, hit while the negotiations were under way for the surrender. Baron Roberto Pasca ex-student of the course 1838-41 and commander of the Partenope (the only warship that followed Francis II in Gaeta), the head of staff of artillery Giovanni delli Franci ex-student of the course 1840‚Äì45 and the general chief of staff Francesco Antonelli ex-student of the course 1817-23 were the signatories of the surrender of the fortress Gaeta. Many years later, another alumnus, the former captain of artillery Vincenzo Scala, a protagonist of 'siege of Messina, would be among the signatories of the Act of Cannes, which marked the final renunciation of claims to the throne of Naples advanced by Prince Carlo Tancredi of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (the second son of Alfonso of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Count of Caserta) for himself and his descendants. Among the protagonists of the Savoy side must be remembered Enrico Cosenz, which landed in Sicily with the third expedition: Cosenz was instrumental during the Battle of Milazzo, during which he rejected the attack on the Bourbon left the grid and was wounded in the neck. He landed in Calabria on August 23, 1860 led the column that allowed him to surround and force the surrender of two brigades to Bourbon Villa San Giovanni and Piale. He was also the protagonist of the surrender of the troops of Giuseppe Ghio in Soveria Mannelli. He came to Naples with Garibaldi, assumed the post of Minister of War and took part in the organization of the plebiscite of 21 October 1860. The Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946) Upon the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, with the surrender of the fortress of Civitella, 3,684 officers were on active duty in the army. Of these 341 artillery officers and 215 Engineering officers came from the Nunziatella. Although it had proved, since its inception, to be a \\"seedbed of good specialist officers\\", the Nunziatella followed the fate of so many institutions of the former Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and by decree of Victor Emmanuel II of 4 May 1861 it was transformed from academia to military school of the Army: this operation provided that it was intended to prepare young people for life weapons, in view of their admission to the Academy of artillery and engineering of Turin and at the School of Infantry and Cavalry of Modena. The new regulations of the renamed Military College of Naples was established by a decree of 6 April 1862 and provided for the admission of boys between thirteen and sixteen who had completed his high school studies. The total number of students was fixed at a maximum value of 250 units. Among others, Congressman Giuseppe Ricciardi in 1861 complained in Parliament that act, by inserting it into a broader discontent for the abolition of other cultural institutions Neapolitan; and a few years later, in 1870, was the former student and professor Mariano d'Ayala to fight in the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy against the new threat of suppression. Victor Emmanuel III dressed in the Nunziatella uniform (about 1888) Nevertheless, the Nunziatella made a major contribution to the training of managerial staff of the Army, so that the three former students Enrico Cosenz (1882‚Äì1893), Domenico Primerano (1893‚Äì1896) and Alberto Pollio (1908‚Äì1914) they were respectively the first, second and fourth Army Chief of Staff. The attitude of distrust of senior management against the former army of the Two Sicilies and the Nunziatella went though mitigated over the years, so much so that in 1881 the fifteen- years-old designated heir to the throne of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele III, was admitted as a Nunziatella student. The king always retained a strong attachment to the Nunziatella and participated personally in the celebrations for the 150th anniversary of its foundation. Colonial wars The latter part of the nineteenth century, and similar to what already done by other European powers, the Kingdom of Italy was engaged in a colonial policy that saw this long in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The colonial period saw alumni participate in operations in Africa and among the fallen in this period remembers the captain Andrea De Benedictis, was killed in 1887 during the battle of Dogali; and on 26 January 1891 a plaque was dedicated to him in the Great Courtyard of the Nunziatella. This period was also of great importance for the history of the school, mainly as a result of the disastrous Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896: it was during this fight, in fact, that was assigned to a former student the first gold medal for military valor after the Italian unification. The artillery captain Eduardo Bianchini, son of the eminent economist of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies Luigi Bianchini, sacrificed himself in place with its mountain battery to allow the Italian main force to fold in front of the enemy offensive from Adwa. The disaster of Adwa had significant consequences not only on the national political level (Prime Minister Francesco Crispi was forced to resign) but also on the attitude of the population towards the military life. Despite the presence in the body of teachers personality which included Camillo De Nardis, Michelangelo Schipa and Agesilao Greco, the number of applications for admission to the Nunziatella, like other military training institutions, experienced a steep fall. The bleeding was such that in 1898 students were reduced to just seventy-six, two hundred less than the period in which he had frequented Vittorio Emanuele III, and it was even proposed the elimination of the institute. To counteract the trend it was tried to make the school more attractive by taking a first reorganization of the studies, promulgated by decree of October 19, 1896, followed by a second reorganization of 20 May 1908. If the first initiative did not produce significant results, the Depending served instead in order: in it for the first time abolished the requirement for students to pursue a career in the military academy and opened the possibility of attending civil university instead. The reform was intended to form, in addition to future military cadres, citizens as well, that while occupying high positions in the future in civilian life, would have retained a strong link with the military environment, thus functioning as a bond with the nation. The number of students grew steadily to over three hundred units on the eve of the First World War. First World War (1915‚Äì1918) Antonino Di Giorgio In 1913 the role of the Nunziatella as an educational institution for the elite military cadres was renewed by the enrollment of the Prince Amedeo of Savoy Aosta: this event caused the School Command to build a network of formality around the young prince, who instead quickly unraveled it, establishing an equal relationship with his classmates. At the outbreak of the First World War, Prince Amedeo requested and received permission to enlist as a private in the Horse Artillery Regiment \\"Voloire\\" and fought on the front of the Carso. Besides Amedeo d'Aosta, many other alumni participated in the First World War on the Italian front, sometimes playing important roles in the war fortunes: among them are notable Pasquale Oro, Giuseppe Pennella and Antonino Di Giorgio. The first, as Commander in Chief of the 34th Division Alpini, was committed to the defense of the Asiago Plateau and fought in contrast to the Austro-Hungarian Strafexpedition; he blocked the enemy, and counter-attacked on the slopes of the Pasubio, thus marking decisively the tide of war. The second, the former Commander of Grenadiers of Sardinia, when in command of the 8th Army was the protagonist of the battles of the Solstice and Vittorio Veneto. The third, major general, commander of the 51st Division in Valsugana, while in Rome was reached by the news of the disaster of Caporetto and immediately left to Udine and took command of the Special Army Corps rapidly formed, which led bucking the stream of stragglers retreating from Caporetto; by engaging strongly the Austro-Germans allowed the main force of Italian to escape; and he was the last general to cross the Piave with his men on the morning of November 9, 1917. After the war, he became Minister of War and entrepreneur in his native Sicily. Among the former students involved in the First World War, eight gained the gold medal for military valor. In this regard, they have to be remembered general Gabriele Berardi, commander of the Sassari Brigade, Umberto Cerboni and Eduardo Suarez, whose names were immortalized on Mount Pasubio in the so-called Street of Heroes; the young Nicola Nisco and Maurizio De Vito Piscicelli and Filippo Zuccarello. Also decorated the highest award for military valor, Ildebrando Goiran and Gaetano Carolei instead survived the conflict, achieving high grades in military and civilian life. On April 21, 1920, in the entrance hall of the school was located a rock of the Venetian Alps surmounted by an eagle and a flag, in memory of all former students who died during the war. It bears the engraved inscription: \\"This bloody rock of Mount Grappa, mute, solemn witness of magnificent Italian feats, perpetuates the memory of those former cadets of the college, famous for glorious secular tradition, which fell fighting bravely in the war of liberation.\\" In addition to the already mentioned gold medals, on the monument were engraved the names of the colonels Fileno Briganti jr. and Vincenzo Galasso, respectively commanders of the brigades \\"Pisa\\" and \\"Napoli\\", to which were added those of five colonels, six lieutenant colonels, nine majors, two captains, twenty captains, three lieutenants, lieutenants thirty, forty-two lieutenants, a sergeant cadet, a cadet infantry officer and a soldier, for a total of one hundred-twenty fallen. Among them it was particularly significant in the case of Alessandro De Mandato, the cadet sergeant: while he was still at the Nunziatella, he was reached by the news of the death of his father at the front and decided to avenge him as soon as possible; in March 1917, just awarded the baccalaureate, he left for the war, and fell in combat in the area of Dosso Faiti only two months later. During the consecration ceremony of the monument all the names of the fallen were called and for each a joint answered \\"present\\"; the mother of De Mandato, oppressed by the loss of both the husband and the child, could not answer and a young cadet answered instead. Traditionally, when cadets and alumni pass by what soon became known as il Masso (the Boulder), they make the military salute. Fascism The gradual militarization of society Italian fostered by the fascist regime of course also affected the Nunziatella. To the institute, as much as to the Military College in Rome and the one in Milan (restored in 1935 but closed in 1943), it was dedicated great attention in view of the expansionistic objectives that the regime and the Crown were devising. Of course, this approach did not admit any deformity in the opinions of those who had responsibility in the education of young students: the professor of literature and philosophy Floriano del Secolo, signatory of the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals, was dismissed from his post in 1925 for refusing to swear allegiance to the Fascist Party. In 1933 the Nunziatella received from his former cadet Victor Emmanuel III the honor to bear the motto Victoriae Regem dedit (Gave the King of the Victory), which obviously alluded to the attendance of the institute by the king himself. In that period, as in all institutions of basic military training, Nunziatella cadets were made obliged to pursuing careers in the Military Academies, thus restoring the rule prior to the 1908 reform. On 25 April 1934 the Prince of Piedmont Umberto of Savoy gave the Nunziatella the labarum, equalized to war flag; a few months later, on November 18, it was celebrated the 150th anniversary of its foundation, during a solemn ceremony that saw the participation of the king and the heir to the throne. The military deployment, in addition to cadets Battalion, was formed by several former cadets (including many classmates of Vittorio Emanuele III) under the command of Lieutenant-General Carlo Perris, the highest-ranking among those present. Among the alumni of notice from this period worth mentioning Angelo Gatti, who was appointed a member of the Academy of Italy in 1937; Federico Baistrocchi was Chief of Staff of the Royal Army from 1 October 1934 to 7 October 1936, and Senator. Alberto De Marinis Stendardo di Ricigliano, Brigadier General, was a senator and Minister of the Kingdom of Italy; General of Army Corps and senators were also Carlo Perris, Guido Guidotti and Armando Tallarigo. World War II The events of World War II also interested gradually the city of Naples, therefore involving students of the Nunziatella. Initially of low intensity, the Allied air raids had in a first period no other consequences on the lives of cadets than to force them to take refuge in an underground shelter in the underlying Chiatamone street. After the disastrous bombing of 4 December 1942 that left more than 500 victims in the city and after 15 December 1942 and 1 January 1943 ones, it was decided, however, to transfer the cadets. The school was moved from March to December 30, 1943 in Benevento, and hosted in the building later seat of the city hospital; this displacement was of great harm to the Nunziatella, since for the looting carried out by German troops in Benevento was lost almost all of the material transported there, except for of the physics laboratory and warehouse assets, which had remained in Naples. Although most of the staff went to Benevento with the cadets, in Naples there was a handful of officers and professors led by Professor Francesco Caruso. It was thanks to these few that it was possible to maintain a presence inside the building, which would have passed through difficult times after the Allied occupation. During the conflict and in the aftermath, the alumni were committed as ever in the most senior positions in the military hierarchy and politics. Vittorio Ambrosio, former chief of staff of the Army, was chief of the General Staff; Antonio Sorice instead held the post of Minister of War in the Badoglio government, succeeded by Taddeo Orlando, lately the Commander-in-Chief of the Carabinieri. A large number of former students fought on all fronts of the ongoing conflict and many victims were counted. Twenty-three of them deserved the gold medal for military valor, falling on the field and being protagonist in important moments of collective Italian memory. In particular, Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta was protagonist of the heroic Italian resistance during the second battle of Amba Alagi; Antonio Cianciullo and Alfredo Sandulli Mercuro were among the victims of the massacre of Kefalonia; Alberto Bechi Luserna was the star of the second battle of El Alamein; Roberto Lordi and Romeo Rodriguez Pereira were among the fallen of the Fosse Ardeatine; Luigi Tandura participated in the Italian Resistance as partisan of Osoppo Brigades. Among those who survived the conflict they are to remember Luigi Pecora, who participated in the fighting of the Four Days of Naples and Giuseppe Izzo, the protagonist of the second battle of El Alamein and the War of Liberation. The Italian Republic (1946-present) The Nunziatella was the training school for Vittorio Emanuele III and Amedeo d'Aosta and then was seen as an expression of the monarchical and fascist regime. The work of contact with the High Allied Command under the auspices of the former student Vittorio Ambrosio, had the effect to prevent its closure, but in heavy conditions: the institution was downgraded to high school boarding civil students. They were forced to take lessons in confined spaces, while most of the building was occupied by a British command and troops from Palestina. After the conclusion of World War II the conditions of surrender of the Kingdom of Italy had a strong impact on the armed forces of the country: these were, in fact, subject to a number of heavy layoffs and limitations, such as the prohibition of building aircraft carriers and demobilization of several departments. Even training institutions of the newborn Italian Army were affected by this policy, so that the military schools in Rome and Milan were suppressed. Even the Nunziatella risked closure but professors, officers and alumni of the School made common cause, raising a strong protest movement that also involved the public Neapolitan was placed strong emphasis on the ancient and glorious roots of the institute by the Bourbons forward and one of the professors, Francesco Caruso, came to rally the undersecretary of defense Mario Palermo, a former student of the course 1914-1917, with the phrase: \\"Would you have the courage to sign the decree on the abolition of the Military College, with so many glories in his bright past, where you yourself were educated? Well, the Nunziatella must not die!\\". The commander Oliviero Prunas sought and obtained to be received by Umberto II, before whom shouted \\"Majesty, the Nunziatella must live.\\" Made a commitment to do everything possible to put the school in a position to operate, Prunas began traveling all Italy with some military trucks, and collecting as many military materials and life commodities could be useful to the life of the institution. The courses of the Nunziatella in Naples resumed on 1 February 1944, but with many mutilations with respect to the past. During the years 1944‚Äì45 both officials that cadets dressed civilian clothes, and then switched to a momentary black uniform during 1945‚Äì46. In 1946 the khaki uniform was restored instead, which was eventually replaced by the traditional historical uniform in 1954. On 1 September 1949, the Nunziatella regained the name of the Military College of Naples and the next May 24, 1950 saw the return of the school flag during a ceremony at the Diaz square, in Francesco Caracciolo street. In 1953 the name changed again in the final \\"Nunziatella\\" Military School. The experience of the danger of suppression had deeply marked the alumni, that in March 1950 formed an association, and elected general Silvio Brancaccio as its president; and the attorney Raffaele Girolamo Maffettone as its secretary. The purpose of the association, according to the statutes, is to \\"keep alive the spirit and traditions of the Nunziatella and supporting its initiatives of any kind.\\" The first activity of the association was to organize a large reunion of all former cadets at the day of the founding of the school: the reunion, which took place between 17 and 18 November 1955, saw the presence of over a thousand participants. That of 1955 was the beginning step of a long tradition of presence of the alumni to the oath of new cadets, which assumed special solemnity on November 18, 1987 when the Nunziatella celebrated 200 years since the foundation. Put behind the war, Nunziatella alumni continued to play important roles in the military and civil life of the country. Between 1969 and 2012 ten of the deputy commanders-in-chief of Carabinieri (Vittorio Fiore, Attilio Boldoni, Vito De Sanctis, Michele Vendola, Paolo Bruno Di Noia, Virgilio Chirieleison, Ermanno Vallino, Goffredo Mencagli, Giorgio Piccirillo, Michele Franz√© and Carlo Gualdi) were former cadets of the Nunziatella and continued in several cases the career occupying the leaders of the security services. Giuseppe Cucchi was director general of the Department of information security. In 2001, almost all the leaders of the Italian Armed Forces were by former Nunziatella cadets: Rolando Mosca Moschini, former commander of the Guardia di Finanza, and the future president of the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), was the chief of staff of the defense; Sandro Ferracuti was the Chief of Staff of the Italian Air Force; Umberto Guarnieri, was the Chief of Staff of the Navy; Alberto Zignani was the commander-in-chief of the Guardia di Finanza. In civilian life they have particularly distinguished Ettore Gallo, president of the Constitutional Court; Claudio Azzolini, Vice President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe; Arturo Parisi, descendant of Giuseppe Parisi was defense minister; Eugenio Barba, one of the leading intellectuals European and winner of the Sonning Prize; Ettore Pancini, a distinguished physicist that was among the discoverers of the muon; Stefano Dubay, winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Movie in 2014 as a member of the artistic team of Frozen; and the edition of 2015 for Big Hero 6, for which he made the protagonist Baymax; and the poet Salvatore Angius, winner in 2015 of the International Simon Bolivar Award, awarded by UNESCO. The former cadets of the Nunziatella were also present as protagonists, as in the past, in important moments of collective national history: Franco Angioni led the Italian expedition in Lebanon, the first international commitment of Italy to outside its borders after the Second World War; Francesco Gentile fell in combating South Tyrolean separatists; Marco Mattiucci is, in turn, fell heroically in Sarno during the disastrous landslide of 1998; Sergio De Caprio, better known as \\"Capitano Ultimo\\" is the police officer who materially he captured Salvatore Riina, the \\"boss of bosses\\" of the Cosa Nostra; Ottavio Oro has been in charge of the investigation for the capture of the Camorra boss Giuseppe Setola. On August 5, 2014, alumni Riccardo Innocenti (class 1984-87) and Francesco Battaglia (class 1985-88) have ascended for the first time ever a summit of the massif of Karakoram in Pakistan and named it \\"Nunziatella Peak\\". In the historic day of 15 November 2014, in the presence of Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, the defense minister Roberta Pinotti, the mayor of Naples, Luigi De Magistris and the president of the National Alumni Association Alessandro Ortis, it was signed an agreement that sanctioned the transfer to the Nunziatella of the Gran Distretto di Pizzofalcone complex, born as barracks of the grenadiers of the Royal Guard in the nineteenth century, and subsequently assigned to the State Police. This agreement is of particular importance for the Nunziatella, as it allows you to expand and qualify relay spaces, and opens the way the transformation of Nunziatella in European military school. Nunziatella today Nunziatella complex (2015) The \\"Nunziatella\\" Military School can be attended only by students who have completed two years of either humanistic or scientific high school. Admission is by competition, which consists of medical, aptitude, athletic test and cultural examinations on the study subjects of the first two years of high school. The course of study at the school is completed with the achievement of baccalaureate and includes, in addition to academic subjects that are common to these high schools, also training courses aimed at a military career. Military activities are carried out during the school year through special training in \\"weapons theory and practice\\", \\"military law\\" and other disciplines of the same area. At the end of each year of study, students also attend a weapon drill camp at some operative unit of the armed forces (for example at the Alpine training center of Aosta or 186¬∫ Parachute Regiment \\"Folgore\\" of Siena) to acquire practical elements of combat training, including the frequency of sessions at the shooting range with the individual weapon (rifle Beretta AR 70/90 supplied to the Italian armed forces, while for the parade activities it is still used the rifle M1 Carbine). Particularly rich is the sports training that allows cadets to practice horse riding, fencing, swimming, athletics, boxing, basketball, volleyball and other sports. The Nunziatella is, along with the Morosini, the institution with the most wins at the inter-school Military Sports Games, an event where students of the four Italian military schools are measured on all sports. The commander of the school (a colonel in the Italian Army) is also the dean of the institute. The recruitment of teachers is by competition, whose basic requirement is to be a confirmed professor at a high school. After graduating, alumni can continue training in the military by applying for admission at all the Academies of the Italian armed forces, where is reserved for them a share of the available positions. Alternatively, those who want to pursue a military career can continue their training process at the university. Alumni use to gather at the oath of the new cadets, which usually takes place on November 18 of each year (Nunziatella's foundation anniversary), in Piazza del Plebiscito in Naples. A major annual event is the Nunziatella Graduation Ball, in recent years combined with the Debutante Ball: This is an event of great importance in the lives of cadets, since it concludes the cycle of studies at the School, and it is increasingly assuming the role of a prominent social event for the city of Naples, as to be regularly followed by the media. Normally, the event is selected for a prestigious venue, as the Royal Palace of Naples, the Royal Palace of Caserta, Villa Campolieto in Herculaneum, the Belvedere Palace of San Leucio, the Pietrarsa railway museum. In 2004 it was held at the Royal Palace of Naples a special event called The Galaxia, namely the gathering of all the courses that year celebrating ten years, or multiples of ten, from the entry to the school; special guest of the evening was the popular actor Bud Spencer, whose father, uncle, grandfather and great-grandfather were Nunziatella alumni. The Nunziatella frequently hosts prominent personalities, who are often invited to give a keynote address at the opening of the academic year. Within the walls of the school have passed the presidents of the Italian Republic Francesco Cossiga, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and Giorgio Napolitano, as Nobel Prize laureates as Rita Levi-Montalcini, captains of industry as Cesare Romiti, successful writers as Pino Aprile or sportsmen as Pietro Mennea. At the School is located the Nunziatella Alumni National Association, founded in 1950 by the lawyer Raffele Girolamo Maffettone and until 2012 the editorial office of the Neapolitan resurrected literary magazine Sud, founded by former student and writer Francesco Forlani, that hosted as contributors Roberto Saviano, Antonio Ghirelli, Tiziano Scarpa and Erri De Luca. Awards Military awards \\"And as in all human things the facts explain better than any theory from which they come, we have to say that living by the rules expertly dictated by Parisi, it came out of those walls the most beautiful flower of noble youth, which, well accustomed to all manner of doctrine, came soon after with a reputation for bravery\\" (Mariano d'Ayala, Napoli militare, 1847) On 29 November 2007 to the Flag of the School was awarded the Bronze Medal of Army Valor for the following reasons: \\"Prestigious training institute whose values are based on the ancient roots of more than two centuries of incessant activity, constantly working with the sublime spirit of sacrifice and honor never tarnished by the succession of historical events. Forge of noble minds, it carried out an irreplaceable teaching action and example for many young people there trained, with a profound awareness of civil society, to the life and weapons. It was clear testimony illustrious alumni who, with deep love of country, honored themselves and Italy. The heritage of sacrifice and glory offered to the country by the students of the \\"Nunziatella\\", exalted by two decorated the Military Order of Italy, 38 gold medals for Valour and numerous silver and bronze medals for Valour, sealed the high educational value and the very high institutional contribution. Shining example of the spirit of service to the Country, the Military School \\"Nunziatella\\" bore out the luster enjoyed and helped to raise the prestige of the Armed Forces in joint and national level\\". Naples, 1787-2007\\" On November 17, 2012, the Flag of the Institute was awarded the Gold Cross of Merit of the Carabinieri for the following reasons: \\"Ancient and prestigious training institute of the Italian Army, elected guardian of military virtues, preparing for life and weapons generations of young people, educating them to the cult of duty and honor.

The Italian President Francesco Cossiga has also granted in 1992 to the cadets of the Nunziatella the honor to boast the buttons of the historic uniform with the monogram RI (Italian Republic), identical to that provided on the uniforms of the officers who make up the Guard of Honor of the President. Motivation of the honor granted is contained in the words of Cossiga himself: \\"The Nunziatella, in addition to being a place of military training, is a place of great cultural and civil heritage. Here, there is the history of our whole country. I believe that Italy Republican must treasure of all those who are the great military traditions and for that very reason that civilians have been formed across the country even when it had not achieved the political unity. My presence at the Nunziatella, therefore, means honoring Italy throughout what is its history.\\" (Francesco Cossiga, 18 November 1989) Students of the Nunziatella lead the kepi of its historical uniform with the number \\"1\\" indicating them to be the first battalion of Italy. Consistent with that status, traditionally they open the annual parade of the armed forces on June 2 in Rome for the Feast of the Italian Republic. Those cadets of military academies, and military officers who have attended the Nunziatella have finally the right to attach to their uniforms a special triangular distinctive, blue, edged with red and marked \\"Military School Nunziatella\\", the center of which is reported the historical kepi uniform worn by students for activities off duty and parade. Civil awards The Nunziatella was awarded the following international recognition as an institution: * \\"Historical and cultural heritage of the Mediterranean countries\\" with the following citation: \\"For the role played in the last three centuries in the field of higher education, such as academic, social and economic development engine for Italy and for all the Mediterranean countries linked to it\\". *Mediterranean Institutions Award 2012 with the following motivation: \\"To have prepared 225 years, generations of the Young to \\"Life and Weapons\\", constituting an intangible heritage of humanity rooted in the history and life of the City of Naples, Italy. The Nunziatella military school is an educational excellence in the Mediterranean and in the World that places ethics and a system of values at the heart of the training of young people, destined to play a vital role in the social life of the future.\\" Nunziatella was donated to December 13, 2012 the Bell of Duty on the initiative of the Province of Latina: the bell was built in memory and recognition of Enrico Cosenz, alumnus and former Chief of Staff of the Army, born in Gaeta. The bell is stained with scenes of the defense of Venice, in which Cosenz participated with another former student Guglielmo Pepe and Daniele Manin; it also bears the coat of arms and the motto of the school and that of the Province of Latina. Coat of arms The blazon of the official coat of arms is as follows: \\"Fine: the first gold of the foal cheerful black; in the second of the red-skinned hand coming out of the right, holding a dagger of silver manicata gold mail post, resting on an open book to the natural; the blue band, on the partition, loaded from three cornflowers gold. The turreted crown is of gold.\\" A golden ribbon, under the shield of the list, bears the motto I prepare to life and weapons. Symbology Gold and red are the colors of the city of Naples and the hoisted black horse also refers to it. The blue band with three lilies of gold refers to the Bourbons of Naples, founders of the School. The armed wing of dagger on the open book refers to the motto of the school. The mottos of the Nunziatella Heraldic motto is for any institution or military unit sign and figure of its identity, together with the coat of arms; the variations of the mottos of the Nunziatella also detect historical and cultural changes underwent in individual historical periods: * 1787-1805 and 1816-1860 - Arma, viri, ferte arma: the motto, used in the Bourbon period, is based on the Aeneid of Virgil (Verg. Aen. 2, 668); from the original classic (Arma, viri, ferte arma; vocat lux ultima victos, \\"Weapons, men, carry weapons; the last light calls the vanquished\\") ruled by Aeneas after witnessing the massacre carried out Pirro in Priam's palace. Its meaning is an invitation to die there with weapons in hand. * 1806-1815 - Multos labores, magni meritis: the motto, used in the short Murat period, apparently did not originate from any classic work, but refers to the close connection between the efforts to deal with and the merits that follow. * 1861-1931 - Et pace et bello: the motto (\\"In peace and war\\"), used in the first post- unification period until a few years before the Second World War, is, in fact, the first expression of the vocation of the Nunziatella as forge not only officers but also of citizens; curious the similarity of the motto with the title of the epic novel War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, but this was published only in 1865 and therefore has no connection with the motto, introduced in 1861. * 1932-1944 - Victoriae regem dedit: the motto (\\"It gave the King of Victory\\") was granted by King Vittorio Emanuele III, a former student of the school, as a direct recognition of the role of the Nunziatella in its formation. * 1945‚Äìpresent - I prepare for life and weapons: the last motto took over after World War II and the establishment of the Italian Republic, and it responds on the one hand the need to eliminate the republican institutions any reference to the monarchy; on the other recovers with other words the motto Et peace et bello, reaffirming once again the identity of the Nunziatella as training institute both military and civilian. Next to the official, there are other two informal mottos, linked to two places in the school: the back wall of the Great Hall shows the motto \\"Being more than seeing\\", translation of the phrase Esse quam videri coming from chapter 98 of the De amicitia of Cicero; under the big clock in the school, located on the first floor landing, it is printed the motto \\"Il perder tempo a chi pi√π sa pi√π spiace\\" (Losing time is more regretted to whom more know), coming from the third canto of the Purgatorio of the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri. Even the five sections (two in classic high school and three in scientific high school) that build the order of studies to Nunziatella have their own official mottos: * Classic A - √úber alles (\\"Above all\\"), borrowed from the opening words of the hymn Deutschlandlied in its historical significance, that the unity of the country should be the first thought of each. * Classic B - Hic sunt leones (\\"Here are the lions\\" or \\"Here it is dangerous\\"), a phrase that was marked on maps of ancient Rome to indicate dangerous and unexplored regions of the world; the motto was introduced March 16, 1962 by the student Ernesto De Pascalis (class of 1960-63). * Scientific A - Docet et imperat (\\"He teaches and commands\\"), transliteration of the maxim Lex imperat non docet (Law prescribes, not teaches). * Scientific B - Sturm und Drang (\\"Storm and assault\\"), directly connected to the eponymous German cultural movement. * Scientific C - We Are the Champions (\\"We are the champions\\"), recently acquired motto borrowed from the homonymous piece of the Queen who replaced Dante Che solo amore e luce ha per confine (That only love and light has as border) (Divine Comedy, Paradise, Chant XXVIII) The Academy is the only remaining military unit and only school to retain a traditional drum and bugle corps (Batteria Tamburi) within the Italian Armed Forces. The patron saint The interior of Nunziatella church. On the altar, \\"L'Annunciazione\\" by Ludovico Mazzanti The official patron of the Military School Nunziatella is Our Lady of the Annunciation which is dedicated to the church from which the institute is named. However, in the 1960s added St. Crispin, namesake of the Jesuit monk whose ghost, according to legend, would haunt the basement of the school. The rituals associated with that internal myth are traced to a tragic event whose memory is still celebrated as part of the legacy of the institute: according to the legend, the night of St. Crispin a cadet died at the Nunziatella and in his memory the Patron saint of that day was adopted as patron of the students; the historical sources identify in the son of the general Giosu√© Ritucci, a cadet of the first year at Nunziatella, the unfortunate protagonist of this episode. Cadets still remember the occasion with a formal sign of respect (the first bed of the School's infirmary is never occupied) and with the celebration of a rite of remembrance on October 25. According to another interpretation, the choice of St. Crispin has literary origins and would refer to the special feeling of brotherhood and equality, regardless of social background, which is spread among the cadets: they allude to the fact that words William Shakespeare attributes in his historical drama to Henry V of England just before the battle of Agincourt. \\"And the Saints Crispin and Crispian, from this day to the end of the world will no longer pass their holiday together without them if we should remember also to us; these we happily few, of this our band of brothers: he who today sheds his blood will be on me forever my brother and, although it is of humble birth, this day I will ennoble\\" The museum complex The building of the Nunziatella encompasses also three important museums, reflecting the deep historical and cultural institution. In the Museo Duca d'Aosta is collected decorations, weapons, flags, historical relics and personal items belonging to Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia-Aosta, said the \\"Invictus Duke\\", father of former pupil Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta and a leading figure of the First World War on the Italian front. The construction of the first nucleus of the Museum was made possible thanks to the work of the former student (then the official school) Francesco Sciascia (class of 1954‚Äì59). In the Science Museum it is conserved an extensive collection of minerals and specimens of animals and plants, as well as a significant number of old instruments, originally purchased for the physics lab by meritorious teacher and commander of School Giuseppe Saverio Poli. On June 16, 2012 it was finally inaugurated the museum of the Nunziatella Foundation, that collects and classifies many items donated by alumni. The museum is run by Giuseppe Catenacci, historian and Honorary President of the National Association alumni Nunziatella. Notable alumni, teachers and commanders In the more than two centuries of history the Nunziatella had among its students numerous personalities from the political, military, cultural and professional Italian and international world. In addition to those already mentioned, notable are the inventor Francesco Sponzilli, one of the pioneers of radio; economist Enrico Barone, father of the theory of marginal productivity; the designer Mario Revelli di Beaumont; historian Angelo Gatti and engineer Gennaro De Matteis, builder of the Palazzo dei Marescialli. Numerous personalities from the cultural world have taught at the Nunziatella, contributing decisively to the development of the students. Among them are of notice Federico Zuccari, founder of Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte; EA Mario, author of The Song of the Piave; Luigi Russo, director of the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa. The Nunziatella had, at 2014, 75 commanders, including numerous alumni and personalities of the Italian civil life, including Luigi Chatrian, a member of the Constituent Assembly of the Italian Republic.

October 2005: p. 63. He first expressed interest in running for public office as municipal councilor of Sorsogon when he was 22. At 25, he again indicated his intention to run, this time as mayor of the municipality. However, on both occasions, his family forbade him from entering politics and insisted that he finish his law studies before embarking on a political career. Consequently, Escudero was 28 when he began his political career. He was elected representative of the first district of Sorsogon in 1998 and was one of the youngest lawmakers in the 11th Congress. Escudero was a member of the Nationalist People's Coalition, the second biggest political party in the Philippines, from 1998 to 2009.

The law was ratified during a plebiscite on December 16, 2000, and Sorsogon functioned as a city on June 30, 2001, with the assumption into office of its first officials. In 2004, Escudero figured prominently in the Philippine presidential elections as the campaign spokesperson of presidential candidate Fernando Poe, Jr., a popular movie actor. Poe eventually lost to the incumbent president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in a highly contested electoral exercise. When evidence of alleged electoral fraud surfaced, Escudero was among the lawmakers who moved for the impeachment of then President Arroyo. However, the President's allies in Congress voted to drop the impeachment complaint. On September 6, 2005, Escudero voted no on the dropping of impeachment complaints against President Arroyo. He explained, \\"It is the truth that has lost. But the search for the truth does not end today. The president and her allies will always be haunted by questions.\\" A new set of impeachment case was filed on 2006 and Escudero maintained his vote against its dismissal. Despite another round of defeat, Escudero said the results \\"will not change the fact that there was cheating, lying, anomalies and stealing in government.\\" Escudero belonged to the anti- Charter Change bloc who voted against the constitutional reform initiatives of then Speaker Jose De Venecia. He believed these attempts to change the Constitution are nothing but last ditch efforts to keep the president and his allies in power. Escudero was a member of a group of NGO-legislators proposing an alternative national budget called \\"Imperatives of Real and Equitable Growth: An Alternative Proposal for Financing the Millennium Development Goals in the 2007 Budget\\". This is in response to the proposed national budget of the administration for not being perceptive to the social development needs of the Philippines. Senate: 2007‚Äì2019 Senator Escudero during a session with the Philippine Senate, September 24, 2014 On January 30, 2007, Escudero filed his candidacy for the Senate of the Philippines. He was elected to the Senate with the second highest tally of votes, slightly behind Loren Legarda. In the 14th Congress of the Philippines, Escudero chaired the Senate Committees on Justice and Human Rights; Ways and Means; and National Defense. In the 15th Congress, he headed the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights and the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. He also led the Joint Oversight Committees on Ecological Solid Waste Management and the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee on the Clean Air Act. On October 29, 2009, Escudero announced his resignation from the Nationalist People's Coalition and became an independent. Escudero was expected to run for the presidency but he did not. Instead, he endorsed the team-up of Senator Benigno Aquino III and Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay. The two political figures, who belong to opposing camps, won as President and Vice President, respectively. On October 2, 2012, Escudero filed for reelection. Prior to the official campaign period, Escudero, Legarda, and Grace Poe were expected to run as common candidates of both the administration and opposition slates. However, the opposition group United Nationalist Alliance junked the three Senate bets. Escudero remained independent but ran as part of the administration-backed coalition Team PNoy. Garnering 17,502,358 votes out of 40,214,324 registered voters who actually voted, he won another term as senator. During the initial announcement of Senate chairmanships in the 16th Congress, Escudero got the Education Committee but ended up as chairman of the powerful Finance Committee. Majority Floor Leader Alan Cayetano explained, \\"Because there was no decision yet on who will be the chairperson of the Committee on Finance, and since it‚Äôs one of the biggest committees or one with the largest jurisdiction, traditionally the chairman of the Committee on Finance would not have any other committee. So Senator Escudero graciously gave up the chairmanship of the committee on education because he took over the Committee on Finance.\\" 2016 vice presidential bid Chiz Escudero declares vice presidential bid, September 18, 2015 Citing a possible bid for higher office in the next elections, Escudero resigned as chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance and as co- chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Public Expenditures on July 28, 2015. In his letter to Senate President Franklin Drilon, Escudero wrote, \\"However, given my public pronouncements regarding a possible candidacy for higher office in 2016, I believe that it behooves me to step down at this juncture to ensure that deliberations on the General Appropriations Bill (GAB) ‚Äì considered the single most important piece of legislation passed by Congress each year ‚Äì are untainted by suspicions or perceptions of partisan politics.\\" Long rumored as the possible running mate of leading presidential candidate Grace Poe, Escudero officially announced his candidacy for Vice President of the Philippines on September 15, 2015 at the historic Club Filipino. In her introduction, Poe enumerated the accomplishments of Escudero as a legislator both in the House and the Senate. said, \\"It‚Äôs true Senator Chiz is my friend, but for the nation, my reason for teaming up with him is personal trust. He is a person who can be trusted, a person who has experience and a person who has already done something for the people.\\" Presidential frontrunner and Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte called the combination of Poe and Escudero as an \\"excellent\\" tandem because of his political experience and her ability to provide ascendancy. A day after his declaration, the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC) administered the oath-taking of 200 officials from Batangas, Laguna, and Quezon as members in part because of support for the Poe-Escudero ticket. Talks are rife the NPC, in coalition with other political parties including the Nacionalista Party, the National Unity Party, and the Makabayan bloc, will back the Poe-Escudero tandem in the coming elections. Former Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office board member Florencio Noel revealed, at least eight party-list groups have also expressed support for Poe and Escudero. In early 2016, Escudero began leading the vice presidential opinion polls being statistically tied with Senator Bongbong Marcos several times, before being beaten by Marcos by April. Escudero continued to drop in April, maintaining third place behind Marcos and congresswoman Leni Robredo. A day after the election, on May 10, 2016, Escudero conceded the race, placing fourth among six candidates with 12% of the votes in the unofficial Comelec transparency server count, behind Robredo, Marcos and Senator Alan Peter Cayetano. Governor of Sorsogon: 2019‚Äìpresent Escudero was elected Governor of Sorsogon and began his duties on June 30, 2019.

They separated after six years marriage and were granted a civil annulment in 2011. Escudero has custody of their two children. In 2012, the senator began dating local actress and TV talk show host Heart Evangelista. Their engagement was announced in August 2014, a few months after Escudero obtained Church annulment of his first marriage. On February 15, 2015, Evangelista and Escudero married in Balesin Island, off the coast of Polillo, Quezon. In May 2018, Evangelista announced that she and Escudero were expecting their first child together. In the same month, however, one of the twins she was carrying was lost to a miscarriage.

The character debuted played by child actors in the 1960s until Kin Shriner assumed the role in 1977. Scotty is often remembered as part of the love triangle with Luke and Laura Spencer; when Scott's wife Laura Webber left him for Luke Spencer, his devastation led to a drastic personality change, and the character became one of General Hospital's long-running villains. However, on Port Charles, the character was portrayed in a more heroic sense. Casting The character was originated as a child in the 1960s, played by the child actor Johnny Whitaker in 1965. He was succeeded by Teddy Quinn in 1966, Tony Camp from 1969 to 1972, Don Clarke from 1973 to 1974, and Johnny Jensen from 1974 to 1975. The character of Scott is most commonly associated with Kin Shriner, who assumed the role beginning August 2, 1977. Shriner left the series briefly to play Jeb Hampton on Texas, and returned in 1982 for a one-year contract. He returned again on November 27, 1987, and left on December 24, 1993. Shriner reprised the role in 1997 on the spinoff Port Charles. He left Port Charles in 2001 and returned to the original series, until his departure in 2004. Shriner returned in 2007 and departed again in November 2008. With the departure of actress Rachel Ames as Audrey Hardy, Scott became the oldest character (in real time) appearing on General Hospital, having been introduced in 1965. On January 14, 2013, it was announced that Shriner would return to General Hospital on February 19, making him the latest in a slew of returning fan favorites. Character development When Kin Shriner assumed the role in 1977, Scotty is a respectable young adult. He enters law school and has a promising future with his career and young love Laura Spencer. The two marry in 1979. However, when Laura is raped by Luke Spencer and subsequently falls in love with Luke, Scotty's devastation hardens his character. Laura leaves him and marries Luke in 1981. Scotty leaves town as Shriner left the series to pursue other opportunities. Executive Producer at the time Gloria Monty asked him to return a year later, ready to turn his character into a \\"rat.\\" Scott becomes known for lying and scheming. Fans accepted the change, both because he was more interesting to watch, and because they understood the character's past and felt that the betrayal of both the love of his life (Laura) and one of his good friends (Luke) left him a broken man, and in turn caused him to become bitter and jaded about the world. Shiner explained in 1982: Storylines 1965‚Äì75 The young Scotty Bentley first came to Port Charles with his mother Meg Bentley and stepsister Brooke, after the death of his father Lloyd. There was a lot of family strife in the first couple of years as Meg became engaged to the dashing Dr. Noel Clinton, sending Brooke into a tailspin. Brooke never liked her stepmother Meg and felt that the engagement to Noel was a slap in the face to her dead father. In retaliation, Brooke seduced Noel, and the two left town and wed. Meg was devastated. A short time later, she met and married Lee Baldwin. Lee adopted Scotty, and the three became a family. Unfortunately, Meg developed breast cancer and had to have a radical mastectomy. The illness caused Meg to have a mental breakdown, and Lee had no choice but to put her in a sanitarium where she died soon thereafter. Lee now had to raise Scotty on his own. Scotty eventually left the show (went away to law school) for a time. 1977‚Äì83 When he returned, he obtained a job at the hospital, where he met the young Laura Webber. They fell in love and, after many obstacles (including the manipulations of Scotty's on-again/off- again lover and Laura's nemesis Bobbie Spencer), they finally married, but their happiness was short-lived. Laura went to work at the Campus Disco for Bobbie's shady brother Luke, who became obsessed with Laura and eventually raped her. In spite of this, Laura fell in love with Luke, ran off with him, and later divorced Scotty after less than two years of marriage. In 1981, at Luke and Laura's wedding, Scotty showed a darker side, as he caught the bridal bouquet and announced he was contesting his divorce from Laura. Since then, although Scott's more scrupulous side has re-emerged more than once, he always returned to engaging in underhanded and often illegal activities, even as district attorney of Port Charles. He has had several brief relationships, and in 1982 married Susan Moore, supposedly for financial reasons while he began an affair with Heather Webber. Susan was the mistress of the wealthy Alan Quartermaine, who with Susan had a son, Jason, with a considerable trust fund. Susan was murdered, and Jason was then raised by Alan and his wife Monica. Scott left Port Charles soon afterward. 1987‚Äì2004 Scott returned in 1987 and helped to destroy Bobbie's marriage to Jake Meyer, before becoming involved in an off-on relationship with Lucy Coe. The two remained good friends, even after Scott married Dominique Stanton, and Lucy offered to be a surrogate mother for Dominique when Dominique learned that she was dying. Sometime after Dominique died, Lucy gave birth to their child, whom Scott named Serena, after Dominique's beloved childhood home Serenity. After an ill- advised engagement to Katherine Bell, Scotty left town once again, then returned to Port Charles in 1997. Scotty has a seat on the board of General Hospital, which he received after negotiating a solution to a nurses strike. He was also Luke's attorney during the murder trial of Stefan Cassadine, although they fought constantly about how to handle the case, and as a result of Felicia's testimony, the case caused great strain in Luke and Laura's relationship. Scotty used this as an opportunity to continue manipulating all things Laura, and they eventually started dating again. Luke was still in the picture though, which caused extreme jealousy on Scott's part. He pushed Laura to finalize her divorce with Luke, and then Scotty and Laura traveled to Hollywood together. Much of the storyline revolved around Scotty's struggle to suppress his jealousy of Luke, out of his genuine desire that Laura return to him willingly. Scotty did eventually blurt out a marriage proposal to Laura, but she ended up choosing Luke instead of him. Scotty couldn't talk her out of it, and eventually turned to his ex-girlfriend, Bobbie Spencer. When Luke and Laura were planning their new wedding, Laura's adoptive father, Dr. Rick Webber, returned to town. Scott and Rick had some kind of shared secret, and Rick pulled strings to help Scott get elected to a position as District Attorney. It seemed that Laura was starting to remember something, and Scott and Rick went to the Scorpios' yard, where they dug up the human skeleton of Rick's old mistress, who had been killed (accidentally) by Laura. When Laura remembered and tried to confront Rick, he died from a blow to the head. Scott tried to pin the blame on Luke (supposedly because he feared that Laura had done it), and played on Luke's guilt that he may have caused Laura's mental breakdown by pushing her to remember. Luke was sentenced to life in prison but escaped and left town. Bobbie eventually broke up with Scott, because of his dirty tactics against Alexis in the run for D.A. Later, Luke returned to town and was arrested again. But Nikolas Cassadine had obtained tapes of Laura confessing to Rick Webber's murder, and Alexis used the tapes to force Scott to drop the charges against Luke, in return for Alexis dropping out of the election. Scotty then had Luke committed to an asylum, for what he had done to Laura. Scott was an extremely corrupt DA, frequently using his position to take action against his enemies, and at one point even ordered Luke arrested by his own son, Lucky. During the storyline with the Port Charles Hotel fire, Scotty faked his own death in order to steal a treasure from Skye. He was faced with an investigation by Internal Affairs and fled the city with the money, presumably leaving with his daughter Serena. From an offshore tropical beach paradise he sent Luke a farewell videotape, taunting him. 2007‚Äì08 In 2007, Scott returns, and it is revealed that he had frequently been visiting the comatose Laura. In March, Luke's daughter Lulu Spencer and stepson Dillon Quartermaine intercept a letter from Alan Quartermaine to Luke. In the event of his death, he had the letter sent identifying Scott as Rick Webber's killer. Soon afterward, Scott visits Laura and confesses to her. He explains that he had gone to see Laura that night and heard screaming coming from the attic. When he got inside he saw Rick trying to inject Laura, so he had grabbed a candlestick and hit him over the head, unintentionally killing him. He left, and by the time Luke got there, Laura had been so far gone that she didn't remember Scott's having been there. Lulu had already told her mother the truth, unsuccessfully hoping it would bring Laura out of her catatonic state. Meanwhile, an ex Iraqi soldier, Logan Hayes, comes to Port Charles and it is eventually revealed that Scott had fathered a son in Texas around the same time that Logan was born. Logan admits he had found letters Scott had written to his mother, and a DNA test proves they are father and son. In the beginning of 2008, Scott and Logan have a rift when Scott accuses Logan of taking police files to blackmail Johnny Zacchara, in order to keep him away from Lulu, whom Logan is trying to win back. Scott puts pressure on Alexis Davis to hand over her job as District Attorney to him. In July, Lulu kills Logan in self-defense, devastating Scott. Johnny takes the blame for Lulu, and Scott is the prosecutor in his trial. He uses dirty tricks to get Johnny the death penalty, including forging papers stating his son was working undercover for the police. Scott calls to the stand Lulu, who has become mentally unstable from the ordeal. Johnny is acquitted, and Scott is enraged. When Scott finds out Lulu was the killer, he threatens her in front of Laura, who awakens and defends her daughter. Scott then kidnaps Laura and takes her to Los Angeles, to relive their honeymoon. Luke, Tracy, Nikolas, Lucky, and Lulu pursue them and bring her home. As Laura boards a plane to France to seek further treatment, Scott is seen behind her on the plane. It is presumed he has gone to live in Paris near Laura and his daughter, Serena. 2013‚Äî In February 2013, Scott resurfaces in Port Charles, revealing to a bewildered Luke that he and Laura are engaged. Scott's return to town also coincides with the appearance of a replica of the infamous Ice Princess Diamond, which had been addressed to Lulu on Valentine's Day. Scott than tries to marry Laura before Luke tries to get Laura back. Scott succeeds, but Laura spends a great time away with Luke, after Lulu is kidnapped. When Laura finally does return, Scott asks her for a divorce, saying it is best for both of them. He then focuses his energies on winning back his old position as district attorney of Port Charles. Scott is given incriminating evidence on his running mate, Lazaro, with resident mob boss, Sonny Corinthos. Scott approaches Lazaro, who bows out of the race. After notifying the mayor Scott is named district attorney. As his first act as D.A. he attempts to send Heather Webber back into custody along with serial-killer, Franco, for fraud and aiding and abetting Webber during Robin Scorpio's kidnapping. Heather contests the charges and confesses that Franco is Scott's son. Back when Laura had requested a divorce from Scott, he was consumed with anger and grief, and had gotten intoxicated at Kelly's one night. Heather, who was also drunk, had found him there, and that is when Franco was conceived. Scott doesn't believe it, but Heather has a birth certificate and D.N.A. tests to back up her claim. Scott realizes that Heather is telling the truth but laments the fact that his career is over because of what will come out about his familial connections. On January 8, 2014, it was mentioned that Scott had finalized his divorce from Laura. Scott also told Lucy that after their one night stand his feelings for her have returned, because he was never tricked by Jerry Jacks. He gains Cameron, Aiden, and Jake Spencer as his step-grandsons by his son Franco's marriage to Elizabeth Webber.

The sisters arrived in Houston from Lyon, France by way of Brownsville, Texas on April 25, 1873. They took up their residence in a large building, once a Franciscan Monastery, across the street from St. Vincent's Church on Franklin Street. A chapel was prepared and on May 5, 1873 Mass was celebrated there. The student body marks this day each on Foundation Day. These pioneering women of early Texas made possible the first permanent school in the city of Houston, then called it Incarnate Word Academy for Young Ladies.  Curriculum  The curriculum is primarily intended to prepare students for higher education and to this end students take core, college- preparatory courses and electives based on their individual interests.  Advanced Placement Program  The school has an Advanced Placement (AP) program with 30 honors and AP classes, wherein students take classes that closely parallel university-level courses in the same subject. These classes follow a strict syllabus and are graded more rigorously than non-AP courses. They culminate in a standardized, comprehensive exam each spring, a passing score on which may earn the student college credit.

The character was created by writer Steve Gerber and artist Cynthia Martin. Poison first appeared in Web of Spider-Man Annual #4 (1988). Publication history Poison first appeared in the lead feature of Web of Spider-Man Annual #4 (1988), by writer Steve Gerber and artist Cynthia Martin. The annual also included a 7-page origin story for the character. Poison returned in an eight-part serial in Marvel Comics Presents #60-67 (October‚ÄìDecember 1990), also by Gerber and Martin. Since then the character has fallen into disuse, and did not appear again until six years later, in Spider-Man #64. Fictional character biography While a first year student at the University of Havana, Cecilia Cardinale becomes romantically involved with Vassily, a member of the military staff at the Soviet embassy. Soviet embassy personnel are forbidden from fraternizing with locals, and when Cecilia becomes pregnant with Vassily's child, he signs a statement saying that she is a prostitute in order to escape full punishment for his violation. She is held in a Cuban prison for several months, and becomes ill from the unsanitary conditions. She is later deported to America, where she lives in a Florida refugee camp. A mysterious entity named Ylandris emerges from the Nexus of All Realities in the Florida Everglades and comes to Cecilia as she lays dying from her illness; Ylandris needs a physical form to survive in Earth's dimension, and proposes merging her essence with Cecilia to keep both beings alive. She later gives birth to her son, Carlos. Once trained in the use of her new power by Ylandris, she takes the name Poison, and becomes a vigilante, working as a motel housekeeper in her civilian identity.Web of Spider-Man Annual #4 Poison kills three of the High Evolutionary's Purifiers, who were sent to kill her because there was a possibility that her powers could be passed on to her offspring. She then journeys to the Nexus of All Realities, where Ylandris splits herself off from Cecilia and uses the Nexus to return to her home dimension. Because Ylandris had modified her genetic structure, Poison retains her superhuman powers even after her departure. Before departing, Ylandris informs her that because she was still pregnant at the time of their merging, Carlos might retain some form of her power as well. She aids Joe Trinity, who communicates with his mop, which he calls Myrna. In reality, it is a supernatural force called Mrinh√§ that is seeking to possess him, taking advantage of his breakup with his ex-wife, whose new husband is working for the mobster called the Slug, to interface with him, eventually joining with him and destroying the mop. Poison destroys Mrinh√§ by taking it up herself and having her Ylandris powers destroy it.Marvel Comics Presents #60-67 Paris Scott hires Poison for the Great Game, so the Cardinales move to New York City. Intending to take her job with Scott, El Toro Negro attacks Poison, but she overpowers him. The wounded Poison is approached by Ben Reilly and, assuming him to be the same Spider-Man that she previously met, entrusts her son's safety to him. When El Toro Negro kidnaps Carlos, she realizes Reilly betrayed her and severs her contract with Scott so that El Toro Negro will release her son. El Toro Negro tries to kill them both anyway, but Reilly saves them both.Spider-Man #64 Much later, Poison was one of numerous minor heroes and villains killed and resurrected in the service of the Hand. She took part in a combined assault by the forces of the Hand and HYDRA on the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier.Wolverine #26-28. Powers and abilities The full range of the mutagenic changes wrought on Cecilia Cardinale's body by the presence of the alien being Ylandris is still unknown. Thus far, Poison has demonstrated superhuman strength and exceptional athletic ability including enhanced endurance and reflexes, as well as the power to levitate, fly at slow speeds, and teleport herself and others. She can also psionically alter the flesh of others to make them sick, injured or diseased, even killing them, disfiguring them as they die. She does not need to touch a person to exercise this power, but can do it simply by looking at them.

Their developmental squad is known as the Crusaders. The club also has a ladies team known as the Lionesses. They currently compete in Midlands 1 East at the sixth tier of the English rugby union system, having switched from Midlands 1 West at the end of the 2017-18 season.  History  Rugby Lions are one of only four teams in England permitted to wear an all-white strip, with England National Rugby Union Team, Rugby School and St Paul‚Äôs School being the others. In recent times, the Lions have not exercised this right, with the home kit normally using black shorts. For the final game of the 2011‚Äì12 season against Hinckley however, the Lions appeared in white shorts as well. In a four-year span from April 2011 to September 2015, the Lions did not lose a single league fixture, winning all 60 matches in that period before their run was ended by a 31-35 defeat at Ledbury RFC in the 2015-16 season opener. On 17 August 2012, the Rugby Advertiser released an announcement, within which was an RFU statement, which confirmed that the Lions had failed to pay off their debts in time, and had been removed from National League 2 South. It did not however say anything concerning whether or not the Lions would still compete in any division in 2012‚Äì13. At a public meeting held on 30 August, attended by over 200 people, club owner David Owen revealed that the Lions would indeed not be competing in any league for the 2012‚Äì13 season, but would instead be organising a series of friendlies. The club used the help of many supporters and local clubs to help out. With many of those present at the meeting putting their names down to volunteer. Twenty fixtures had to be fulfilled to demonstrate that the club was able to put out a side and run successfully as a club. Many former players including the clubs 'tailenders' team came together to enable the Lions to fulfill those matches. In May 2013, it was announced that the Lions' bid to be accepted back into the RFU league system had been successful, although they were forced to rejoin at the lowest possible level, Midlands 5 West (South). On 9 August 2013, it was announced that the Lions would be featured on BT Sport's rugby programming into the new season; with the Lions' First XV travelling to the studio to participate in filming on the indoor pitch.

Soon after, he recruited several highly experienced players and coaches, including Neil Back (Head Coach) and Ben Gollings (Player/Backs Coach). Having been relegated to the National League 3 Midlands previous season, most players from the previous season had left the club. Players who remained with the club included Nick Walton, Ben Nuttall, Callum Tucker, Fraser Tait, Matt Mountford, Neil Davies, Paul Davies and Jack Young. This meant that almost all of the entire 2011‚Äì12 squad had to be either bought or promoted from the youth team. Some of the players brought in had been at the club before, such as Ade Hales and Beau Carney. The new additions worked, with the Lions winning every game in the first half of the season, a run they carried on into 2012. The league title was secured with two games remaining on 31 March 2012 in the home game against Dudley Kingswinford, with the Lions triumphing 19‚Äì14. The Lions also won the Warwickshire Cup, winning 10‚Äì9 in the final against Sutton Coldfield.

Esnoga is the word for synagogue in Ladino, the traditional Judaeo-Spanish language of Sephardic Jews. The Amsterdam Sephardic community was one of the largest and richest Jewish communities in Europe during the Dutch Golden Age, and their very large synagogue reflected this. The synagogue remains an active place of worship and is also a popular tourist attraction. Background The spacious interior is filled with benches The Sephardim (Hebrew for \\"Jews of Spain\\") were issued with the Spanish Royal Alhambra Decree in 1492, whereby they were given the choice of exile from Spain, or conversion to Catholicism, or failing to do either, execution. Of Spain's estimated 200,000 Jews at that time, around half converted; many by coercion, others because of social and financial pressures preventing their departure, and a few out of genuine religious conviction. They became Spain's Jewish-origin New Christians or conversos (i.e. \\"converts\\" to Catholicism). Of the other half of Spain's Jews who did not convert, and instead chose exile, some sailed south (becoming the North African Sephardim), others went east (becoming the Eastern Sephardim), but most crossed the border west to Portugal. In Portugal, Jewish life was interrupted only a few years later, when there too they were issued with the Portuguese decree against the Jews in 1496. While in theory, the Jews now in Portugal who chose not convert to Catholicism also had the option to be expelled (or executed) by 1497, the Portuguese king, not wanting a similar Jewish flight and brain drain as happened in Spain, in practice blocked Portugal's ports of exit, and subsequently reasoned that those who stayed behind agreed to become Christians by default. Thus the Jews in Portugal were forced to convert to Catholicism in 1496 after the decree and, all but a few who did manage to flee, became Portugal's Jewish-origin New Christians or conversos. For the next few centuries, the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal continued to investigate the conversos and their descendants on suspicions that they continued to practice Judaism in secret. Many in fact did continue to practice Judaism behind closed doors, while publicly professing to be Catholics; in Spanish and Portuguese these were called Marranos. The persecutions and trials by the inquisition against conversos lasted well into the late 1800s. Furthermore, the legal distinction between so-called Old Christians and New Christians was maintained for centuries, with a person's pedigree always on record. Both those who actively maintained Jewish practices in secret, and also some sincere conversos who had converted fully to Catholicism, were at times hounded, persecuted and executed on charges of being Marranos. This was often a pretext for the confiscation of their property. Many of them wished to have freedom of religion again and to be free from this institutionalized anti-Semitism. Amsterdam, then one of the greatest cities in the world, offered both of these things. In this historical context, a substantial migration of conversos from the Iberian Peninsula to Amsterdam took place from the 1600s to the early 1800s. Once in Amsterdam, many returned to Judaism openly and publicly. They called themselves Portuguese Jews, even those who came directly from Spain. They wanted to avoid being identified with Spain, which was at war with the Dutch Republic at the time during the Eighty Years' War. This branch of Judaism is also known as the Western Sephardim. The Sephardic Jews in Amsterdam were known as the \\"first modern Jews\\" because they were the first to distinguish between religious and secular spheres of their individual and collective lives. Their religious life was focused primarily on the synagogue, the religious calendar of Jewish life, and an eagerness to provide a Jewish education for their children. During the Holocaust, the facility was slated to become a deportation center for Jews, but Leo Palache and a team of volunteers managed to dissuade the Nazis from this plan. Instead, the building concealed Jewish ritual items for deported Jews in the sanctuary ceiling and attic floor. The WWII diary of executive director, Salomon Coutinho, was discovered in Amsterdam and details the synagogues works and efforts to protect the building during the War. Construction and building Interior of the Portuguese Synagogue in 1695 by Romeyn de Hooghe On December 12, 1670, the Sephardic Jewish community of Amsterdam acquired the site to build a synagogue and construction work began on April 17, 1671, under the architect Elias Bouman. On August 2, 1675, the Esnoga was finished. The design is based on the plans for King Solomon's temple. The inscription above the entrance is from Psalm 5:8: \\"In the abundance of Thy loving kindness will I come into Thy house\\". The sign also contains \\"1672\\", the year the building was intended to be completed, and \\"Aboab\\", the name of the chief rabbi who initiated the construction project. The building is free-standing and rests on wooden piles; the foundation vaults can be viewed by boat from the canal water underneath the synagogue. The entrance to the main synagogue is off a small courtyard enclosed by low buildings housing the winter synagogue, offices and archives, homes of various officials, the rabbinate, a mortuary, and noted Etz Hayim library. The interior of the synagogue is a single, very high rectangular space retaining its original wooden benches. The floor was covered with fine sand, in the old Dutch tradition, to absorb dust, moisture and dirt from shoes and to muffle the noise. Only five synagogues in the world had a sand floor, and this was the only one with such a floor surviving outside the Caribbean region. During the 1955‚Äì1959 renovation, the former Etz Hayim seminary auditorium was redesigned as a winter synagogue; central heating and electric lighting were added. The benches were taken from a synagogue originally built in 1639 and the Hechal dates from 1744.The ark is made from a solid piece of jacaranda wood from Brazil and the main sanctuary does not have any internal electric system; two chandeliers that hold 1000 candles are lit when necessary.  Ets Haim Library  The Portuguese Synagogue has one of the oldest Jewish libraries in the world and filled with original and rare texts and is constantly called upon for academic and rabbinical research. It was founded in 1616 and has been housed in the historical complex of the Portuguese Jewish community of Amsterdam since 1675. In 1889 the private library of the then librarian David Montezinos was donated to Ets Haim and the library is known since then as Ets Haim/Livraria Montezinos. In the 1940s, the library's contents were shipped to Germany by the Nazis and the books were returned to the Netherlands after the war; the books were sent to Israel in 1979 and returned to Amsterdam in 2000. In 2014, in partnership with the National Library of Israel, a majority of the manuscripts were digitized, making the catalog available online and free.  Interior  The interior of the Portuguese Synagogue is of the longitudinal Iberian-Sephardic type. The Holy Ark is situated in the South East Corner of the building and faces Jerusalem. On the other side of the room, opposite of the ark, is a tebah. The Women's Gallery is supported by twelve stone columns, each which represents one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. In addition to these columns, there are four large brass chandeliers that hold a total of a thousand candles. All of the candles are lit in the synagogue during worship services. The light of these candles shine together through the 72 windows that exist in the building. Around the building, there are numerous offices, archives, the rabbinate, the mortuary, and the Ets Haim. The Ets Haim (Tree of Life) is the library that contains valuable collections of Sephardic manuscripts.

History Pyramaze was formed in 2001 by guitarist Michael Kammeyer. Next to join were fellow Danes drummer Morten Gade S√∏rensen (Wuthering Heights, Anubis Gate) and bassist Niels Kvist. American keyboardist Jonah Weingarten, who originally met Kammeyer over the Internet, joined next. The band then set out in search for a singer. After listening to many demos, the band selected American singer Lance King (formerly of Balance of Power) to be their lead vocalist. The band's first live show took place on April 23, 2004, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They released their debut studio album, Melancholy Beast, in May 2004 and followed with a tour over the summer of 2004. During this time, Danish guitarist Toke Skj√∏nnemand joined the group. In February 2006, the band released their second album, Legend of the Bone Carver, a concept album that was received very well by fans. On September 15, 2006, the band performed at the ProgPower USA VII festival in Atlanta, Georgia. Shortly after that performance, on November 10, 2006, the band announced on its official Web site that Lance King was no longer Pyramaze's singer.Official website accessed July 15, 2008 On April 14, 2007, former Iced Earth vocalist Matt Barlow returned to the metal scene as Pyramaze's new singer. On December 11, 2007, Jon Schaffer announced on his Web site that Barlow had rejoined Iced Earth. Barlow finished recording Immortal with Pyramaze before leaving to work solely with Iced Earth.Official website accessed January 5, 2008 On March 13, 2008, Pyramaze released demos of two songs from Immortal, \\"Year of the Phoenix\\" and \\"Caramon's Poem.\\" The album was officially released May 30, 2008. On July 11, 2008, Pyramaze announced that former Tad Morose and Bloodbound singer Urban breed would be taking over the role of lead vocalist. His first activity with the band was performing on their Danish tour in November 2008 in support of Volbeat. On February 10, 2011, it was announced that band founder, songwriter, and guitarist Michael Kammeyer and bass guitarist Niels Kvist would be departing the band, citing family responsibilities. Shortly after, keyboardist Jonah Weingarten issued a letter stating that, despite losing their founder, leader, songwriter, guitarist, and bass guitarist all in one day, Pyramaze would carry on. This was backed up by a statement Pyramaze released that the band's producer, Jacob Hansen, formerly of Invocator, Anubis Gate, and Beyond Twilight, would be joining as guitarist, as well as continuing to mix the band's albums. The band went on a short hiatus soon afterwards while still looking for a new lead vocalist. Then in 2015, the band finally recorded its next album Disciples of the Sun with their new vocalist, Terje Haroy. The album was released on May 22, 2015, in the United Kingdom on May 25, 2015, and in North America on May 26, 2015 on Inner Wound Recordings. On September 8, 2016, Pyramaze played a special show at ProgPower USA XVII, with the current lineup of the band being bolstered by guest performances of Matt Barlow and Lance King. Their follow-up to Disciples of the Sun titled 'Contingent', was released on April 28, 2017 through Inner Wound Recordings.

It was discovered during James Cook's first voyage, and became the first insect to be described from Australia. The weevil measures up to long and includes distinctive metallic green and black scales. It is found only on 28 species of the plant genus Acacia. Taxonomy Chrysolopus spectabilis was first described in 1775 by the Danish entomologist Johan Christian Fabricius, in his work ', making it the first insect to be described from Australia. Fabricius named the species Curculio spectabilis, where the specific epithet ' translates as \\"remarkable\\" or \\"admirable\\". Fabricius would have had ample opportunity on visits to London in the previous years to examine the insect collections from Cook's expeditions. Fabricius' species was transferred in 1817 by Ernst Friedrich Germar to the genus Chrysolopus, and so reached its current scientific name. Since then, other species have been added to the genus, which now contains 11 species, all native to Oceania. The colouration of the various species varies widely from green to black. Discovery Map from 1773 of Botany Bay, showing the landing site of HMS Endeavour at Point Sutherland The earliest specimen of Chrysolopus spectabilis to be collected was caught by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander at some time between April and August 1770, as part of James Cook's first voyage to the south seas. It was one of only five insects collected by that expedition, the others being a butterfly, the ant Myrmecia gulosa, and two flies. Banks summarised the Australian insect fauna thus: \\"Of insects here were but few sorts and among them only the ants were troublesome to us\\". The insect collections were not otherwise mentioned in the logs of the Endeavour expedition, and the locations where they were collected are open to speculation. Despite variations on the name \\"Botany Bay weevil\\", it was probably not collected in the vicinity of Botany Bay, since it is typically too cold and wet there in April. It is more likely that it was collected in the warm, dry surroundings of Cooktown, Queensland, which the expedition visited that August. After the colonisation of Australia in 1788, the species was frequently encountered in the summer months in the environs of Sydney, explaining the common names. Illustration from 1805, showing the C. spectabilis (top right) and the Brazilian Entimus imperialis (bottom middle). The common name \\"diamond weevil\\" was coined in 1805 by Edward Donovan. It is based on the name of the Brazilian species Entimus imperialis, which was known as the \\"diamond beetle\\", since the two species had similar colouration, and the diamond beetle was already well known in Europe. The two species are not closely related. In the years following its discovery, \\"Curculio spectabilis\\" was a valued item for collections, due to its unusual appearance. The type specimen from the Endeavour expedition now forms part of the Banks Collection at the Natural History Museum in London. It is in good condition, although its legs are missing most of their tarsi. Description Adult on white The body of Chrysolopus spectabilis is an elongated oval long. The elytra are black, with irregular spots of bright metallic green. The underside of the body is shaded in matt green, and a white or green line runs the length of the animal's sides. The head, thorax and legs are black with occasional metallic green markings. The colouration varies across the year, with animals emerging later in the season having a bluer colour. The snout is about as long as the bell-shaped pronotum, and strongly curved. The geniculate antennae arise from halfway along the snout, and end in a small club. The compound eyes protrude slightly. The elytra display a row of furrows with slight depressions, and the animal's ventral side is also covered with scales. The powerful legs have a thick covering of hair on the tarsi, which have no claws. The larvae are long; they are white, round and wrinkled, with a few hairs on their sides, and a red‚Äìbrown head with black mandibles. To date, the pupa has not been described. Distribution and habitat Chrysolopus spectabilis occurs in the eastern and southern states of Australia, with a range stretching from the coastal region of Queensland to Victoria and eastern parts of South Australia. It is most common in eastern parts of New South Wales, particularly the surroundings of Sydney, and out to the foothills of the Great Dividing Range. Adults are active both in daytime and at night, mostly during the warmer months (November‚ÄìMarch). During this period, C. spectabilis is often seen in built-up areas and woodlands in areas with moderate precipitation, particularly around Acacia plants. In open areas, such as northern New South Wales, Acacia species with phyllodia (flattened leaf petioles) are preferred, but in more wooded areas, such as the Blue Mountains, species with paripinnate leaves are preferred. Adult beetles have been recorded on 28 Acacia species, out of the 1000 species present in Australia; the larvae, on the other hand, have only been recorded on seven species. The larvae are, however, thought to feed on the same species as the adults. Life cycle Development of the beetles to the adult state usually takes less than a year. Females bore up to 20 small holes close to each other in the stem of the Acacia plant, immediately above the soil level, and lay a single egg into each hole. After hatching, the grubs bore deeper into one of the plant's main roots. The imagines (adults) emerge in the spring in the more southerly latitudes, but can emerge throughout the year in the subtropical parts. They bore their way out of the plant, leaving the empty pupal case behind. Ecology Acacia mearnsii, one of the 28 Acacia species which C. spectabilis feeds on. Chrysolopus spectabilis feeds almost exclusively on particular species of Acacia, including the Cootamundra wattle Acacia baileyana, the silver wattle Acacia dealbata, the Australian blackwood Acacia melanoxylon and the golden wattle Acacia longifolia. The beetles choose young plants, around tall, before they have flowered. They use the long snout and powerful mouthparts to make holes in the stem and leaves, in order to reach the sap and to build egg chambers. In south-eastern Australia, C. spectabilis can be a pest of acacia plantations. Adults can destroy new shoots, and the larvae can limit the plant's water uptake. The adults can even cause a tree to die through ring barking. Despite its garish colours, C. spectabilis is not poisonous. It is very alert, and if it senses danger, will either fall to the ground and play dead, or hold fast to the plant with its legs.

It deviated so much from mainland deer that it is impossible to indicate with certainty its ancestor. Suggested ancestors are Pseudodama peloponnesiacus and Praemegaceros verticornis.  Ecology  The fauna of which Candiacervus is an element is called Biozone II, or the Mus Zone (after the common mouse).Mayhew, D.F. 1977. The endemic Pleistocene murids of Crete I-II. Proceedings of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen B, 80 (3), 182-214. This fauna inhabited Crete between the late Middle and Late Pleistocene, which means between 0.3 and 0.01 million years ago.Dermitzakis, M.D. & J. De Vos 1987. Faunal Succession and the Evolution of Mammals in Crete during the Pleistocene. Neues Jahrbuch Geologischer und Pal√§ontologischer Abhandlungen 173 (3), 377-408. The typical fauna elements of this biozone are the common mouse (Mus bateae, M. minotaurus), the dwarf hippo (Hippopotamus creutzburgi) the dwarf elephant (Elephas antiquus creutzburgi), the Cretan deer (Candiacervus, with the eight species ropalophorus, sp. IIa, b and c, cretensis, rethymnensis, dorothensis and major), the Cretan otter (Lutrogale (Isolalutra) cretensis), and the Cretan shrew (Crocidura zimmermanni).  Extinction  Ill limb bone of Candiacervus from the cave Mavro Muri, showing an osteosclerotic pathology. From the late Middle Pleistocene till the arrival of humans in the Holocene, Crete was inhabited by small elephants, eight types of Cretan deer and a normal sized mouse.Reese, D.S., ed. 1996. Pleistocene and Holocene Fauna of Crete and its First Settlers. Monographs in World Archeology 28. Madison, Prehistoric Press. The cause of the dramatic faunal turnover, which led to the extinction of the endemic deer and elephants, may simply have been the arrival of paleolithic humans.Sondaar, P.Y., Van der Geer, A.A.E. 2005.

Another option is a gradual depletion of the ecosystem, as indicated by the finding of a complete herd consisting of individuals suffering a bone disease of an osteosclerotic nature (see X-ray photograph).Dermitzakis M., Van der Geer AAE, Lyras G. 2006.

These are among the most serious diseases caused by fungi and moulds in South India. It occurs almost every year in Malnad, Mysore, North & South Kanara, Malabar and other areas. Similar diseases of palms are also known to occur in Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and Sumatra. The causative organism was first identified as Phytophthora palmivora by Edwin John Butler in 1917.Tucker, C.M. (1931) Taxonomy of the genus Phytophtora de Bary University of Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station Research Bulletin 153; Biology Phytophthora palmivora produces abundant sporangia on V-8 agar under continuous fluorescent light. However, light is not required for sporangia production on infected papaya fruit. Sporangia are usually produced in clusters sympodially. Sporangia are papillate and ovoid with the widest part close to the base. They are easily washed off and each detached sporangium contains a short pedicel. The average size of the sporangia is 50√ó33 ¬µm with a length of about 1.6 times longer than it is wide. Sporangia germinate directly in a nutrient medium by producing germ tubes that develop into mycelial masses. In water, however, zoospores are released from germinating sporangia. Zoospores aggregate and form distinct patterns at 16 ¬∞C in water. Chlamydospores produced in infected papaya fruit and pure papaya juice are thick-walled. However, chlamydospores produced in papaya juice at lower concentrations or in other kinds of fruit juice are mostly thin-walled. In the presence of nutrients, chlamydospores germinate by producing germ tubes that continue to grow and form mycelial masses. In water, chlamydospores germinate by producing short germ tubes, each with a sporangium at the tip. Sexual reproduction in Phytophthora palmivora requires the presence of opposite mating types known as A1 and A2. Both A1 and A2 isolates can produce zoospores by selfing when stimulated by sex hormones produced by A2 and A1, respectively. Light is inhibitory to zoospore formation but stimulatory to zoospore germination. Mature zoospores can be induced to germinate by treatment with 0.25% KMnO4 for 20 min and incubation under light during germination. Although sporangia and zoospores may survive in soil for short periods, chlamydospores are the main survival structure for P. palmivora in nature. Zoospores are capable of long-term survival but do not play a significant role in the disease cycle because sexual reproduction in P. palmivora requires the presence of opposite mating types, and the chance for this to occur in nature is very low. During rainy periods, chlamydospores in soil may germinate in water to produce sporangia and release zoospores. The impact of falling rain drops may splash zoospores into air in droplets. The zoospore-containing droplets may be further dispersed by wind and become the inoculum for infecting fruit and occasionally stems of papaya in the fields. The pathogen produces abundant sporangia on the surface of infected fruit that are further dispersed by wind-blown rain and cause outbreaks of Phytophthora fruit rot in the same and nearby orchards. Chlamydospores formed in fallen fruit survive in soil and serve as the main source of inoculum for infection of roots of papaya seedling in subsequent plantings. Phytophthora root rot of papaya seedlings is most serious during rainy periods. Under waterlogged conditions, P. palmivora may attack roots of papaya older than three-months of age, the time at which they become resistant to the pathogen under normal conditions. Therefore, Phytophthora root rot may occur on papaya at any age in poorly drained areas. Waterlogged conditions appear to weaken the defense mechanism of papaya roots against invasion by the pathogen. Mobility of zoospores of P. palmivora under such conditions also may contribute to the severity of the disease due to their attraction by papaya roots. Favorable temperature is also a contributing factor to the severity of Phytophthora diseases because of its effect on growth and sporulation of the pathogen. Phytophthora palmivora has an optimum temperature for growth of 30 ¬∞C, a maximum temperature of 36 ¬∞C and a minimum temperature of 12 ¬∞C. The pathogen produces the most sporangia at 25 ¬∞C but no sporangia are produced at temperatures higher than 35 ¬∞C or lower than 15 ¬∞C. Hosts and symptoms Although the common name of Phytophthora palmivora is bud rot of palms, it affects many tropical plants and has a moderately broad host range. P. palmivora is well studied in coconuts and papaya trees, however there are multiple hosts that are less commonly studied. One common symptom of P. palmivora is fruit rots which are found in papaya, citrus, coconuts, durian, and cacao. Root rots are another symptom of P. palmivora and can be seen in red maples, citrus, papaya, mango, durian, and black pepper. Another symptom is the presence of cankers which are found in red maple, papaya, rubber, mangos, and cacao. Bud rots can also be seen in papaya and coconuts infected with P. palmivora. Bud rots are also found in Palmyra palms and coconut palms. Collar rots are found on citrus, mango, and black pepper infected with P. palmivora. The signs of P. palmivora are microscopic and can be differentiated from other oomycetes by the presence of oval shaped papillate sporangia with short pedicles and spherical oogonia with narrow stalks (Widmer, 2014). Epidemiology Rain and wind are the two major factors in the epidemiology of Phytophthora fruit rot of papaya. Rain splash is needed for liberation of sporangia of P. palmivora from the surface of infected fruit into the atmosphere and for projection of the soil inoculum into air. Wind is required for dispersal of the inoculum once it reaches the air. Therefore, wind-blown rain is essential for initiation of the primary infection and the development of epidemics in papaya orchards. Phtophthora palmivora also cause fruit rot, bud rot, etc.. Bud rot of coconut (cocos nucifera)is very common in India. Atmospheric temperature of 18-20 ¬∞C along with high humidity activates the pathogen Management General control Since P. palmivora is an oomycete the simplest management technique is to control the amount of water present in the soil. Techniques for controlling moisture include: monitored watering, pruning to increase airflow and decrease humidity in the soil, as well as making sure that areas where potential hosts are planted are not prone to flooding, oftentimes this includes planting on an incline. Other means of cultural control for P. palmivora include mulching to reduce the number of spores released via rain splash, complete removal of infected host plants and materials, and in some cases the use of companion crops. Companion crops are planted in the same fields as the host plant and are used to divert some of the pathogen away from the hosts, an example being planting bananas and avocados in the same field. Chemical control methods for P. palmivora include: protectant fungicides such as the Bordeaux mixture, phosphonates which control the mycelial growth of the pathogen, dithiocarbamates such as Mancozeb, and phenylamides which control the spread of the pathogen from the roots of the host. Host resistance is also a method of controlling the pathogen, resistant plants generally have thicker cuticles which inhibits the ability of the pathogen to enter the host. Non-chemical control in papaya Root rot of papaya seedlings, caused by P. palmivora, in replant fields can be controlled with the virgin soil technique. Virgin soil (soil in which papaya has never been grown in before) is placed in planting holes about 30 cm in diameter and 10 cm deep with a mound about 4 cm high. Roots of papaya plants are protected by the virgin soil during the susceptible stage, and become resistant to the pathogen when they extend to the infested soil. Trees established with the virgin soil method in the replant fields produce fruit as abundantly as those growing in the first planting fields. The virgin soil method has the advantages of being relatively inexpensive, very effective and nonhazardous. Cultural practice is also important in the management of Phytophthora diseases of papaya. Incidence of Phytophthora root rot of mature trees in waterlogged areas during the rainy periods can be greatly reduced by improving drainage in the orchards. Infected fruit on the trees and those that have fallen to the ground should be removed to reduce the inoculum for aerial infection of fruit and stems, and infection of seedling roots in subsequent plantings. Importance Because P. palmivora infects multiple hosts that hold an economic significance including cacao, coconut, papaya, mango, olive trees, and black pepper, this is a pathogen of great concern. The pathogen is found in various regions of the planet ranging from Africa, India, South America, and even the temperate regions of North America. It has been estimated that 10-20% of all cacao is lost due to Phytophthora Pod Rots (PPR) which includes P. palmivora. Due to P. palmivora‚Äôs dependence on moisture, the annual yield loss fluctuates and in some years losses have been as high as 75% in some regions. This impacts the cost of cacao, and thus the pathogen controls the cost and availability of products such as chocolate. In mangoes, the pathogen is known to kill young plants, specifically nursery plants. This impacts the long-term number of commercially available plants which could lead to potentially lower crop yields. In coconuts, the expected yield losses caused by P. palmivora have been up to 2.5% per month during the rainy season, this can impact coconut product manufacturing such as coconut oil. In the 1970s P. palmivora had such a severe impact on black pepper plants in Brazil that it was no longer commercially grown, and it is considered the most detrimental pathogen of black pepper. As previously stated impacts of P. palmivora commercially cause it to be a pathogen of significant importance. References * Butler. (2008, October).

Recently, ASU has been working closely with the staff to provide maximum support for its gifted students. Dr. Josh Dean was the Operations Administrator and founder of University High. Ms. Courtney Stevens was the counselor of UH students but was promoted to Operations administrator when Dr. Dean was promoted to a district office. Most students achieve post-secondary education. The first graduating class in 2010 walked away with about 3 million dollars in Scholarships between about 100 people, some of them with multiple scholarships. The school is staffed by dedicated teachers that expect success from the students, and newer versions of books are used, which have been circulating since the school began. UH students are not given special treatment, but they are expected to work harder than other students. In 2010, the school's usage of tutor buses was cut as part of other cuts to the Tolleson Union budget. However, in 2011, buses were brought back into the program. In 2011, University High was ranked No. 1 in the Arizona state through the result of AIMS scores.

Voyager encounters an alien race, but runs afoul of their principles. The Voth are humanoid lizards, and the plot revolves around one particular scientist who has taken an interest in studying Voth origins. Plot On the planet where Voyagers crew had previously been marooned, Professor Gegen and his assistant Veer, two paleontologists of a space-faring saurian species known as the Voth, discover the skeletal remains of a human, most likely Lt. Hogan. They are fascinated by the similarity of its genome to their own species, and Gegen suggests that this supports the highly controversial Distant Origin theory, that the Voth had originated on a far- distant planet instead of the current area of space from which they rule their empire. Proof of the theory has been sought by other Voth scientists, but the heretical theory has often led to their exile. To confirm their proof, Gegen and Veer track down the origin of the skeleton, learning of Voyagers presence in the Delta Quadrant. They locate the ship and transport aboard while cloaked, observing the mostly human crew in the setting. Voyagers sensors detect their presence, and the crew reveals the two Voth. Veer responds instinctively by releasing sedative-tipped needles that strike Chakotay; Gegen grabs the human and transports him aboard his ship, fleeing from Voyager. The Doctor examines Veer and identifies the similar genetic structure; he and Captain Janeway use simulations to determine that the Voths descended from a species of dinosaur known as the hadrosaurs, of genus Parasaurolophus. Gegen wakes Chakotay, and explains the situation, requesting Chakotay accompany him when he presents his evidence to the Voth elders; meanwhile, Voyager is captured by the Voth. Gegen is put on trial for heresy, and it soon becomes clear that he has been pre-judged guilty and the \\"trial\\" is only an opportunity for him to recant and reduce his punishment. Veer, recovered from Voyager, is coerced to act as a witness against Gegen by Minister Odala. Chakotay attempts to argue for Gegen, noting that the Voth theory of origins has changed so much to fit what the Voth wish to believe and not reality. Odala rejects this, sentencing Gegen to a prison colony unless he recants. When he still refuses, she then orders Voyager destroyed and its entire crew, the evidence for his theory, also sent to the prison colony. Gegen, unwilling to see them destroyed, realizes he has no choice but to recant. Odala assigns Gegen a new job, and orders Voyager to leave Voth space forever. Before departing, Chakotay gives Gegen a globe of the Earth, which Gegen acknowledges that someday, the Voth will accept as their home world. Production Writer Brannon Braga saw \\"Distant Origin\\" as being a metaphor for the relationship between Galileo Galilei and the Catholic Church. He described it as \\"the perfect episode\\" because it included not only that metaphor, but also a \\"what- if\\" science fiction premise and a unique structure as the episode follows the Voth as they investigate the humans. The Voth returned in Star Trek Online as part of the \\"Season Eight\\" expansion. The development team had previously hoped to introduce the species, but that idea was scrapped. As part of their redesign, they were changed from purely scientists as seen in the episode to scientifically advanced soldiers. A variety of variants on the Voth were created that had not been seen in \\"Distant Origin\\", such as those in powered armour as well as raptors - an enemy type far more similar to typical dinosaurs. Special effects This episode features the fictional Star Trek spacecraft the Voth City Ship, which was noted in 2015 as one of the largest fictional spacecraft featured in science fiction television and movies up to that time. At over 9 km (6 miles) in length the Voth ship is quite large for Star Trek, and a little bigger than the Varro Generational spacecraft which was also featured in Star Trek: Voyager (featured in \\"The Disease\\"). The biggest spacecraft at that time was rated as the Alien Mother ship in the 1996 film Independence Day, and the biggest Star Trek vessel up to that time was V‚ÄôGer featured in the 1979 blockbuster Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Reception and home media release Although Michael Piller had left the production team on Voyager at the beginning of the third season to work on Star Trek: Insurrection, he described \\"Distant Origin\\" as the best episode of the series so far. TrekNews.net ranked this the 4th best episode of Star Trek: Voyager, in 2016. When Dreamwatch magazine reviewed the episode for the VHS release, it rated it as seven out of ten, calling it a \\"welcome breath of fresh air\\" but felt that the alien characters were initially played more for comedy value than they should have been. It added that since the entertainment industry was involved in the McCarthyism of the 1950s, that \\"anything suggesting that intellectual freedom should be cherished is a good thing.\\" In terms of science fiction world building, the Voth City Ship was noted for its size and power over the USS Voyager in this episode.

He was granted a chaplaincy of the Free Chapel at Snodhill Castle, a post which was given away a year later to Robert Cowper, another Gentleman. He is reported as being organist of St Albans Abbey responsible for the music there from 1498 to 1502. Fayrfax gained a Mus.B. from Cambridge in 1501, and a Mus.D. in 1504; he later acquired a D.Mus. from Oxford (by incorporation) in 1511. He became a member of the Fraternity of St Nicholas in 1502. At the beginning of his reign in 1509, Henry VIII granted Fayrfax the annuity of a farm in Hampshire and later made him a 'Poor Knight of Windsor' (with a life-time award of twelve pennies a day) on 10 September 1514. He also possessed, and surrendered, two ecclesiastical livings.D. M. Greene, Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers (Reproducing Piano Roll Fnd., 1985), p. 25. He received payments for clothes for state occasions and for tutoring choirboys. From 1516, for four consecutive years, he presented the king with collections of his compositions and received financial rewards. In 1520 he led the Chapel Royal in the state visit to France of the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He died in 1521, possibly at St. Albans, where he was buried. Work and influence His surviving works are six masses, two Magnificats, thirteen motets, nine part-songs and two instrumental pieces. His masses include the 'exercise' for his doctorate, the mass O quam glorifica. One of his masses, Regali ex progenie, was copied at King's College Cambridge and three other pieces (Salve regina, Regali Magnificat, and the incomplete Ave lumen gratiae) are in the Eton Choirbook. One of his masses, O bone Jesu, commissioned by Lady Margaret Beaufort, is considered the first Parody mass. He has been described as 'the leading figure in the musical establishment of his day' and 'the most admired composer of his generation'.H. Benham, John Taverner: His Life and Music (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), p. 66. His work was a major influence on later composers, including John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545) and Thomas Tallis (1505‚Äì85).

Blue denotes \\"approve\\", red \\"disapprove\\", and green \\"unsure\\". Spikes in approval followed the September 11 attacks, the beginning of the 2003 Iraq War, and the capture of Saddam Hussein. George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, has elicited a variety of public perceptions regarding his policies, personality, and performance as a head of state. In the U.S. and elsewhere, journalists, polling organizations, and others have documented the expression of an evolving array of opinions of President Bush. Time magazine named George W. Bush as its Person of the Year for 2000 and 2004, citing him as the most influential person during these two years. The approval ratings of George W. Bush ranged from a record high to a record low. Bush began his presidency with ratings near 60%. In the time of national crisis following the September 11 attacks, polls showed approval ratings greater than 85%, peaking in at 92%, and a steady 80‚Äì90% approval for about four months after the attacks. Afterward, his ratings steadily declined as the economy suffered and the Iraq War initiated by his administration continued. By early 2006, his average rating was near 40%, and in July 2008, a poll indicated a low of 22%. In an August 2008 Rasmussen poll, likely voters were asked the question \\"Will history rate George W. Bush as the worst President ever?\\"‚Äî 50% responded \\"no\\", 41% said \\"yes\\" and 9% were \\"unsure\\". (subscription required) Background At the beginning of his first term, Bush's reputation suffered due to his narrow victory in Florida and the attendant controversy surrounding his electoral college victory, which included accusations of vote suppression and tampering. While routinely criticized by Democrats, Bush was also sometimes criticized by Republicans. A number of American celebrities and sports and media personalities engaged in heated criticism of Bush. Bush was also subject to criticism in the international community for his foreign policy. He was, at times, targeted by the global anti-war and anti- globalization campaigns . Street protests sometimes occurred during Bush's diplomatic visits to other countries. His policies were the subject of heated criticism in the 2002 elections in Germany and the 2006 elections in Canada. Support among conservatives Bush has enjoyed strong support among Republicans and Americans holding conservative views, and for the 2004 election, 95‚Äì98% of the Republican electorate approved of and voted for Bush, a figure exceeding the approval of Ronald Reagan. This support waned, however, due mostly to Republicans' growing frustration with Bush on the issues of spending and illegal immigration. Some Republicans even began criticizing Bush on his policies in Iraq, Iran, and the Palestinian territories. Personal image Country image Raised in West Texas, Bush's accent, vacations on his Texas ranch, and penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image. \\"I think people look at him and think John Wayne,\\" says Piers Morgan, editor of the British Daily Mirror. It has been suggested that Bush's accent was a deliberate and active choice, as a way of distinguishing himself from his family's traditionally wealthy, intellectual, Northeastern image, and anchoring himself to his Texas roots. Both supporters and detractors have pointed to his country persona as reasons for their support or criticism. Vision In contrast to his father, George H.W. Bush, who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme, Bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks. Intellectual capacity Bush's intellectual capacities were questioned by the media which speculated about his IQ. A hoax report claiming Bush had the lowest IQ of any American President of the last 50 years circulated in 2001. Though no official IQ test score for Bush has been found, the score he received on his SAT during his final year of prep school at the exclusive Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts is known. He scored 1206, which has been correlated to an IQ of 120. The score that Bush received on his qualifying test for the military suggests that his IQ was in the mid-120s, placing him in the 95th percentile of the population for intelligence. An article published in the journal Political Psychology estimated Bush's IQ at 125. The same study estimated the IQ of Bush's predecessor Bill Clinton at 149. The study's director noted that \\"Bush may be 'much smarter' than the findings imply\\". A lecturer in American politics at Warwick University said: \\"A major part of [Bush's] public persona, to some extent, I think deliberately, is that he is not an intellectual. But he went to Yale, he has had an exclusive upbringing and he is by no means a dimwit.\\" Bush's detractors tended to focus on various linguistic errors made by him during his public speeches, colloquially known as Bushisms. His mispronunciation of certain words was ridiculed in the media and in popular culture. Even as early as the 2000 presidential debates, it was the subject of a Saturday Night Live sketch (see Strategery). Perhaps his most famous nonstandard pronunciation is that of \\"nucular\\" instead of \\"nuclear\\", although he is not the only American president to have done this. Merriam-Webster lists \\"nucular\\" as a variant but nonstandard pronunciation of nuclear. Domestic perception of Bush approval rating followed the September 11 attacks, the beginning of the 2003 Iraq conflict, and the capture of Saddam Hussein. Bush began his presidency with approval ratings near 50%. Following the September 11 attacks, Bush held approval ratings of greater than 85%, among the highest for any President. Since then, his approval ratings and approval of his handling of domestic, economic, and foreign policy issues steadily declined, and despite consistent efforts to do so, President Bush and his Administration were unable to rally public support for the last three years, with each year seeing a steady decline in the Administration's support level to the point of Bush eventually dropping to a 19% approval rating and 77% disapproval rating, both records for a sitting president. In 2002, Bush had the highest approval rating of any president during a midterm congressional election since Dwight D. Eisenhower. In an unusual deviation from the historical trend of midterm elections, the Republican Party regained control of the Senate and added to its majority in the House of Representatives. Typically, the President's party loses congressional seats in the midterm elections; 2002 marked only the third midterm election since the Civil War that the party in control of the White House gained seats in both houses of Congress (others were 1902 and 1934). In 2003, Bush's approval spiked upward at the time of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in February. The upward trend continued through the invasion of Iraq in March. By late 2003, when presidential opponents began their campaigns in earnest, his approval numbers were in the low to middle 50s. Most polls tied the decline to growing concern over the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq and a slow recovery from the 2001 recession. Polls of May 2004 showed anywhere from a 53% to a 46% approval rating. In April 2006, the president's approval continued to decline. Four states continue to maintain a positive approval rating: Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, and Nebraska. His disapproval rating in traditionally red states had risen, with higher than 60% of voters disapproving in Ohio, Florida, Arkansas, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia, Missouri, and Iowa. Even in his conservative-spun home state of Texas, disapproval reached 51 percent. His disapproval rating in several American states had reached an all- time high, with more than 70% disapproving in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Delaware, Vermont, and New York. His highest approval rating stood at 55% in Utah, and his lowest, 24%, in Rhode Island. In polls conducted between August 7 and 16, 2006, Bush's average approval rating was 37.0%, and his average disapproval rating was 57.3%. A poll taken in mid September 2006 indicated that 48 percent of Americans believed the war with Iraq has made the U.S. less safe, while 41 percent believed the war has made the U.S. safer from terrorism. Another poll shows that a majority of Americans, by a margin of 61 to 35 percent, believe that the United States is not better off because of Bush's policies. At the conclusion of 2006, an AP-AOL News telephone poll of 1,004 adults found President George W. Bush to be both the \\"top villain\\" and \\"top hero\\" of the year. Bush was followed in the \\"villain\\" poll by Osama bin Laden, who took in 8 percent to Bush's 25 percent; Saddam Hussein (6 percent); and Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (5 percent). In the hero poll, Bush's 13 percent was followed by: Soldiers/troops in Iraq (6 percent), Jesus Christ (3 percent), Barack Obama (3 percent), and Oprah Winfrey (3 percent). Polls conducted after Bush's troop surge strategy was announced in January 2007 showed his approval rating had dropped to approximately 32%. On February 13, 2008, an average of major polls indicated that Bush's approval rating stood at 33.3%. The same average showed, for polls issued during the period from September 5 to 16, 2008, that Bush's approval rating was 31.9%, and his disapproval rating was 64.8%. A poll by Rasmussen Reports on December 10, 2005 asked, \\"Should President Bush be impeached and removed from office?\\" 32% said \\"yes,\\" and 58% said \\"no.\\" Earlier polls asked conditional versions of the impeachment question. For example, Zogby International on November 2, 2005 asked whether respondents agreed with the statement, \\"If President Bush did not tell the truth about his reasons for going to war with Iraq, Congress should consider holding him accountable through impeachment.\\" Americans agreed with this, 53% to 42%. A poll by Newsweek on October 19, 2006 revealed that 51% of respondents believed that the impeachment of George W. Bush should be a priority.NEWSWEEK Poll: GOP Losing Its Base ‚Äì Newsweek Politics ‚Äì MSNBC.com An August 2008 poll found that 41% of Americans thought that George W. Bush is the worst President in United States history, while 50% disagreed. Bush's critics have questioned his leadership skills regarding some events. One occasion was on the moment of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks: after being told by Chief of Staff Andrew Card that the U.S. was \\"under attack\\", Bush continued with a reading lesson with elementary school children for seven minutes. Democratic 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry cited Bush's lack of swift action, calling into question the incumbent's leadership capabilities, and concluding: \\"Americans want to know that the person they choose as president has all the skills and ability, all of the mental toughness, all of the gut instinct necessary to be a strong commander in chief.\\" The 9/11 Commission later released a summary of Bush's closed-door testimony, which stated that Bush's \\"instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis\\". It went on to say \\"The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening.\\" This situation was featured prominently in Michael Moore's 2004 documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. Bush twice, in late 2001 and early 2002, stated that before entering the classroom he had seen on a television set the first plane hit the World Trade Center, and that he had assumed it was an accident.President Meets with Displaced Workers in Town Hall Meeting December 4, 2001President Holds Town Hall Forum on Economy in California January 5, 2002 This was impossible, as no televised footage of the first plane crashing into the tower was broadcast until the afternoon of that day. The White House explained his remarks as \\"a mistaken recollection\\".Paltrow, S. (2004) \\"Day of Crisis: Detailed Picture of U.S. Actions on Sept. 11 Remains Elusive.\\" Wall Street Journal March 22 Domestic policy Domestic criticism of Bush has waxed and waned throughout his administration. Before 9/11, Bush was reviled by the bulk of the American left, mostly for his role in the controversial 2000 election, and for his No Child Left Behind education program. The next major domestic item which Bush faced significant opposition to was his program of tax cuts, codified in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Both acts ultimately passed, but calls for their repeal lasted until the end of the 2004 campaign. Democratic candidate Howard Dean in particular called for a repeal of the part of the tax cuts which affected the wealthiest Americans in order to fund public health care programs and reduce the federal deficit. After Bush was re-elected, he made Social Security reform a top priority. He proposed options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments, creating a \\"nest egg\\" that he claimed would enjoy steady growth. This led Democrats to label the program a \\"privatization\\" of Social Security. Bush embarked on a 60-day tour to shore up public support for the plan, attacking the political reaction against reforms. Ultimately, Congressional Republicans could not reach a consensus on the plan, and the Democrats were unanimously opposed. Bush was left without any political will to pass his reforms. The issue was dropped, and the status quo maintained. Bush has been increasingly forced to defend his actions on many fronts and has been unable to generate widespread support in the nation as a whole. After the Democratic Party regained control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 midterm elections, MSNBC reported that \\"The war in Iraq, scandals in Congress and declining support for Bush and Republicans on Capitol Hill defined the battle for House and Senate control\\". Calling Bush \\"The Mother of All Big Spenders\\", the libertarian think-tank Cato Institute writes that \\"Sadly, the Bush administration has consistently sacrificed sound policy to the god of political expediency\\". Cato's Chris Edwards said, \\"When he gives speeches now, you hear him bashing the Democrats on overspending. It sounds ridiculous, because we know he's a big spender.\\" \\"After running up $3 trillion in new debt ‚Äì including more than half a trillion dollars for what some have called his flawed Iraq policy ‚Äì some people find it astounding that the president is once again lecturing Congress about fiscal responsibility and fiscal priorities,\\" stated Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev). Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve for 18 years, serving under six Presidents and who describes himself as \\"a lifelong Libertarian Republican\\", writes in his book The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World that Bush and the congressional Republicans \\"swapped principle for power\\". \\"Little value was placed on rigorous economic policy debate or the weighing of long-term consequences\\". Greenspan, again promoting his book, also says \\"I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil\\" and \\"getting Saddam out of there was very important, but had nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction, it had to do with oil.\\" With regards to the costs of the war in Iraq, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will come to between one and one and a half trillion dollars by 2010. In fact, according to the former World Bank vice-president, Joseph Stiglitz, when factors like medical and welfare costs of US military servicemen are added in, the cost to date is closer to $3.3 trillion. However, continues Stiglitz, \\"Three trillion is a very conservative number, the true costs are likely to be much larger than that ... The money being spent on the war each week would be enough to wipe out illiteracy around the world ... Just a few days' funding would be enough to provide health insurance for US children who were not covered,\\" he said. The relaxed regulation under the Bush presidency are regarded to have been a major contributing factor to the subprime mortgage crisis, and there are fears that the United States and the world economy could slide into another Great Depression. A Harper's Magazine column by Linda Bilmes, a lecturer in Public Finance at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and Joseph Stiglitz titled \\"The $10 trillion hangover: Paying the price for eight years of Bush\\", \\"estimate that the cost of undoing the Bush administration's economic choices, from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the collapse of the financial system, soaring debt and new commitments to interest payments and Medicare, all add up to over $10 trillion\\".

The controversial dismissal of seven U.S. attorneys by the Bush administration's Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2006, and their replacement by interim appointees, led critics to argue that the administration had undermined both the integrity of the Department of Justice and the non-partisan tradition of U.S. Attorneys. Others likened the event to Watergate, referring to it as Gonzales-gate, and members of Congress from both parties called for the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.See references on Alberto Gonzales#Calls for resignation.2C firing.2C and no-confidence resolution Response to Hurricane Katrina Bush came under more criticism when Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast region during the early hours of August 29, 2005. In the wake of the hurricane, two levees protecting New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain collapsed, leading to widespread flooding. In the aftermath of this disaster, thousands of city residents, unable to evacuate prior to the hurricane, became stranded with little or no relief for several days, resulting in lawless and unsanitary conditions in some areas. Blame for inadequate disaster response was partially attributed to state and local authorities, but public outcry in the disaster's early hours was largely directed at the Bush administration, mainly the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security alleging weak crisis management and coordination. In fact, a Canadian search-and-rescue team actually made it to a New Orleans suburb five days before U.S. aid arrived. Others have identified political conservatism as the overriding cause of problems in the way the disaster was handled. These critics argue that the alleged unreadiness of the United States National Guard, negligence of federal authorities, and haplessness of officials such as Michael Brown did not represent incompetence on the part of the federal authorities, but were instead natural and deliberate consequences of the conservative philosophy embraced by the Bush administration, especially \\"sink or swim\\" policies to force reductions in government expenditure and privatize key government responsibilities such as disaster preparedness, both of which resulted in the systematic dismantling of FEMA by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Criticism led to the resignation of FEMA director Michael Brown, and eventually, Bush himself accepted personal responsibility for what he deemed \\"serious problems in the federal government's response\\" in a September 15, 2005 press conference. Several politicians called for either congressional or independent investigations, claiming that the Executive Branch cannot satisfactorily investigate itself. Environment Bush has been criticized by national and international environmental groups for his administration's rollbacks of environmental protections going back more than three decades. These are in areas ranging from the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts to climate change. According to MSNBC: In \\"Texas Chainsaw Management\\" (2007) Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. argues that \\"The verdict on George W. Bush as the nation's environmental steward has already been written in stone. No president has mounted a more sustained and deliberate assault on the nation's environment. No president has acted with more solicitude toward polluting industries. Assaulting the environment across a broad front, the Bush administration has promoted and implemented more than 400 measures that eviscerate 30 years of environmental policy.\\"\\"Texas Chainsaw Management\\" (2007) Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Kennedy has also written a book Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy. George W. Bush has also been criticized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, representing over 20 Nobel Laureates, who accuse him of failing to acknowledge basic science on environmental issues. The group says that the Bush administration has engaged in intentional suppression and distortion of facts regarding the environment. In the waning days of his administration, Bush sought rule changes which would negatively impact a wide range of environmental issues. Economic policies Moral and ethical questions have been raised over the billions of dollars Bush has requested for the Iraq war, which Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) has said ensures that less money is made available to help children and the poor in the United States. Senator Harry Reid (D ‚Äì NV): \\"The Leave No Child Behind Act is leaving children behind. We need money to take care of that; there isn't enough money because of the war in Iraq.\\" and \\"How much longer are we going to be asked to spend $12 billion a month on this war, when we don't have money for health care? We tried to get 10,000 poor children health insurance. The president said there's not enough money to do that.\\" Critics have accused him of stinginess toward poor children with regards to health care in a time when it is increasingly unaffordable. \\"The Bush administration, fighting efforts by states and Congress to expand a popular health insurance program for children in low-income families, is making it more difficult for families to sign up ... 'The ultimate effect of this new policy is that tens of thousands of children who have health insurance will effectively lose that insurance,' said Rachel Klein, deputy director of health policy for Families USA, a Washington-based consumer group\\". Another example is Bush's effort to cut food stamps for the poor. In 2005, Bush called for \\"billions of dollars in cuts that will touch people on food stamps and farmers on price supports, children under Medicaid and adults in public housing.\\" While passed by the Republican Congress, initially the \\"White House proposed the restriction\\". Foreign policy and national security War on Terror Bush received criticism for publicly using phrases like \\"bring it on\\" and \\"wanted dead or alive,\\" both regarding terrorists. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., called Bush's language \\"irresponsible and inciteful\\". \\"I am shaking my head in disbelief,\\" Lautenberg said. \\"When I served in the Army in Europe during World War II, I never heard any military commander ‚Äì let alone the commander in chief ‚Äì invite enemies to attack U.S. troops.\\" The Iraqi Resistance group known as the \\"Islamic Jihad Army\\" put out a video that stated \\"George W. Bush, you have asked us to 'bring it on.' And so help me, [we will] like you never expected. Do you have another challenge?\\" Bush apologized for these comments in 2006. Iraq Bush has taken a significant amount of criticism for his decision to invade Iraq in March 2003 and his handling of the situation afterwards. As Bush organized the effort, and ordered the invasion himself, he has borne the brunt of the criticism for the undeclared war. A Newsweek poll taken in June 2007 showed a record 73% of respondents disapproving of Bush's handling of the war in Iraq. Enhanced interrogation techniques controversy Another point of discussion has been whether the enhanced interrogation techniques in the Abu Ghraib prison and the Guant√°namo Bay detainment camp constitutes torture or not. Although a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll \\"found that sizable majorities of Americans disagree with tactics ranging from leaving prisoners naked and chained in uncomfortable positions for hours, to trying to make a prisoner think he was being drowned. Bush has stated that \\"We do not torture.\\" Yet, many people and governments and non-governmental organizations disagree and have staged several protests. These sentiments are partly a result of the Pentagon's suggestion that the president can decide whether normal strictures on torture still apply if it outweighs the security of the nation, and because the Bush administration has repeatedly acted against attempts to restrict controversial interrogation techniques, including signing statements by Bush to exclude himself from the laws created by the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 as well as vetoing legislation that would have made waterboarding and other coercive interrogation methods illegal. Furthermore, some are concerned by the Bush Administration's use of Extraordinary rendition, where individuals are sent to other countries where torture can easily occur without any form of oversight. Bush defends this practice on the basis that: A Pentagon memo lists many interrogation techniques which were requested and approved during Bush's presidency on the basis that \\"The current guidelines for interrogation procedures at GTMO limit the ability of interrogators to counter advanced resistance\\". The Bush administration's connection to these controversial interrogation techniques has been one of the main considerations in the movement to impeach George W. Bush. These controversial enhanced interrogation techniques have in several cases become military policy and in response to Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse controversy Germany had looked into seeking to charge Rumsfeld and two others with war crimes. Foreign aid Under the Bush administration, more aid has been given to Africa than under any other US president or world leader in history, with a total of $15 billion spent to fight AIDS and poverty as well as diplomatic assistance between warring peoples and other humanitarian efforts. Yet, it has to be noted that this was in nominal terms. In real terms, he actually lowered the percent of G.D.P given as aid to foreign countries.Frist, Bill. \\"Commentary: Bush saved 10 million lives\\", 2009. p. 1,2Moody, Barry. \\"Unpopular at home, Bush basks in African praise\\", 2008. p. 1,2  Bush Derangement Syndrome neologism  American pundit and psychiatrist Charles Krauthammer, noting the reaction of liberals to George W. Bush and his policies, in a 2003 column coined the term Bush Derangement Syndrome to describe \\"the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency‚Äînay‚Äîthe very existence of George W. Bush\\". While Krauthammer's column was somewhat tongue-in-cheek (e.g., \\"What is worrying epidemiologists about the Dean incident, however, is that heretofore no case had been reported in Vermont, or any other dairy state\\"), the term indicates a belief that some extreme criticisms of President Bush are of emotional origin rather than based in fact or logic. The term has been adopted by writers across the political spectrum and is most closely associated with liberal reaction to Bush policies past and present. The neologism is not unique to Bush, with several commentators borrowing Krauthammer's coinage to define \\"Thatcher derangement syndrome\\", in reference to Margaret Thatcher, referring to the extremely vitriolic reactions Thatcher evokes among British leftists, both during and following her tenure as Britain's prime minister, and most notably distinguished in the aftermath of her death in 2013. Similarly, the term Trump derangement syndrome was coined to refer to perceived irrational criticism of Donald Trump. Foreign perception of Bush \\"Bush Go Home\\" in Vienna, 2007 Opinions of Bush from outside the U.S. are less than favorable. For example, a global sampling in 2005 of 21 nations found that 58% of those sampled believed that the president's reelection would have a negative impact on their peace and security; only 26% believed it would have a positive one. In 18 of the 21 countries surveyed, a majority of respondents held an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as \\"negative\\" for world security. The United Kingdom's Daily Mirror newspaper ran the following headline the day of Bush's reelection: \\"How Can 59,054,087 People Be So Dumb?\\", underlining Bush's unpopularity in some sections of the British press. Among the population of Britain, two-thirds of the population holds a dim view of Bush, a figure that is duplicated in Canada. After his reelection in 2004, Bush was viewed favorably by 38% and unfavorably by 53% in Italy, but much worse in other countries: \\"Three-quarters of those in Spain and more than 80% in France and Germany had a negative view of President Bush's role in world affairs.\\" In Turkey, 72% of those polled said that Bush's reelection made them \\"feel worse about Americans\\". In November 2006, a survey taken in Great Britain, Mexico, and Canada showed that they believed Bush was more dangerous than North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In Islamic countries, opinion of Bush was even less favorable. In Islamic countries, Bush's unfavorable ratings were particularly high, often over 90%. In Jordan, for example, Bush's favorable rating was only nine percent. \\"What the World Thinks of America\\" Poll results prepared by ICM research for the BBC Bush enjoyed somewhat more favorable views among the populations of some allied states. In one multi-nation poll after Bush's 2004 reelection, the only three countries (out of 21 polled) in which a majority or plurality saw Bush's return to office as positive for peace and security in the world were the Philippines (63%), India (62%), and Poland (44%). In one poll of 10 countries, Israel was the only country where the population had a net favorable opinion, with 62 percent favoring Bush. Surveys of historians Since 2006, surveys of professional historians have given the Bush presidency low marks. A 2006 Siena College poll of 744 professors reported the following results:Experts: Bush Presidency Is A Failure; Little Chance To Improve Ranking . Siena Research Institute. May 1, 2006 *\\"George W. Bush has just finished five years as President. If today were the last day of his presidency, how would you rank him? The responses were: Great: 2%; Near Great: 5%; Average: 11%; Below Average: 24%; Failure: 58%.\\" *\\"In your judgment, do you think he has a realistic chance of improving his rating? Two- thirds (67%) responded no; less than a quarter (23%) responded yes; and 10% chose no opinion or not applicable.\\" Thomas Kelly, professor emeritus of American studies at Siena College, said: \\"President Bush would seem to have small hope for high marks from the current generation of practicing historians and political scientists. In this case, current public opinion polls actually seem to cut the President more slack than the experts do.\\" Dr. Douglas Lonnstrom, Siena College professor of statistics and director of the Siena Research Institute, stated: \\"In our 2002 presidential rating, with a group of experts comparable to this current poll, President Bush ranked 23rd of 42 presidents. That was shortly after 9/11. Clearly, the professors do not think things have gone well for him in the past few years. These are the experts that teach college students today and will write the history of this era tomorrow.\\" In 2008, the History News Network conducted an unscientific poll among 109 professional historians. That poll found that, among those professional historians, 98% believe that the George W. Bush presidency is a failure, and that 61% believe it to be the worst in history.McElvaine, Robert S. \\"HNN Poll: 61% of Historians Rate the Bush Presidency Worst\\". April 1, 2008.

The film is critical of Bush and the War on Terrorism. Christopher Hitchens and Ed Koch have criticized Fahrenheit 9/11 as dishonest and inaccurate. W. In 2008, director Oliver Stone, a noted liberal and Democrat who is known as a critic of Republican policymakers including Bush, directed a biographical film about Bush entitled W., featuring Josh Brolin in the title role. W. was appraised as a surprisingly even-handed and restrained treatment of Bush and his policies, given Bush's incredibly low popularity around the time of the film's release.

Lewis, Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications, 1984, p. 18 In 1559 and 1561 he published two series of landscape prints by an anonymous Flemish draughtsman now referred to as the Master of the Small Landscapes. The series of landscapes were drawn from nature in the vicinity of Antwerp and had an important influence on the development of Flemish and Dutch realist landscape art.Larry Silver, Peasant Scenes and Landscapes. The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006 Quatre Vents The publishing house Aux Quatre Vents played an important role in the spread of the Italian High Renaissance throughout northern Europe as Cock published prints made by prominent engravers such as Giorgio Ghisi, Dirck Volckertsz Coornhert and Cornelis Cort after the work of leading Italian painters like Raphael, Primaticcio, Bronzino, Giulio Romano and Andrea del Sarto. The Italian historian of architecture Vincenzo Scamozzi copied many of the engravings published by Cock in 1551 for his volume on Rome entitled 'Discorsi sopra L'antichita di Roma' (Venice: Ziletti, 1583).Praecipua aliquot Romanae Antiquitatis Ruinarum Monimenta at the British Museum Cock collaborated with the Spanish cartographer Diego Guti√©rrez on a 1562 Map of America.Diego Guti√©rrez at the Library of Congress' website Hieronymus Cock collaborated with Antwerp architect and designer Cornelis Floris de Vriendt in the publishing of Cornelis Floris' designs for monuments and ornaments: the ‚Äò‚ÄôVeelderley niewe inuentien van antycksche sepultueren‚Äô‚Äô (‚ÄòThe many new designs of antique sculptures') was published in 1557 and the ‚Äò‚ÄôVeelderley veranderinghe van grotissen‚Äô‚Äô (‚ÄòMany varieties of grotesques‚Äô) in 1556.

Printmaker and Publisher\\", PhD dissertation, Yale University 1971, published in the series Outstanding Dissertations in the Fine Arts, Garland Publishers, New York / London, 1977. His widow Volcxken continued the publishing house until her death in 1601. In 1572 she published a book by Dominicus Lampsonius called Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae inferioris effigies (literal translation: Effigies of some celebrated painters of Lower Germany), a set of 23 engraved portraits of artists with short verses in Latin printed below them. Hieronymus Cock had been working on this publication at the time of his death. The quality of the 23 prints was outstanding as they had been made by some of the leading engravers of the time such as Johannes Wierix, Adriaen Collaert and Cornelis Cort.Joanna Woodall, Dem dry bones. Portrayal in print after the death of the original model The artists included in the book were (in the order in which they appear in the book): Hubert van Eyck, Jan van Eyck, Hieronymus Bosch, Rogier van der Weyden, Dirk Bouts, Bernard van Orley, Jan Mabuse, Joachim Patinir, Quentin Matsys, Lucas van Leyden, Jan van Amstel, Joos van Cleve, Matthys Cock, Herri met de Bles, Jan Cornelisz Vermeyen, Pieter Coecke van Aelst, Jan van Scorel, Lambert Lombard, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Willem Key, Lucas Gassel, Frans Floris and ending with Hieronymus Cock.Pictorum aliquot celebrium Germaniae inferioris printed in 1572 at the Courtauld Institute of Art The book includes a poem by Lampsonius dedicated to the memory of Hieronymus Cock and applauding the work of his widow. The portraits and texts present an honour roll of the earlier generations of Netherlandish artists. Their publication thus contributed to the formation of a canon of famous Netherlandish painters, which was well underway even before Karel van Mander published in 1604 his biographies of early and contemporary Netherlandish artists in his Schilder-boeck.Jeffrey Chipps Smith, 'Historians of Northern European Art: From Johann Neud√∂rfer and Karel van Mander to the Rembrandt Research Project', in: Babette Bohn, James M. Saslow, A Companion to Renaissance and Baroque Art, John Wiley & Sons, 2 Jan, 2012, p. 509 The publisher Hendrik Hondius I published in 1610 a book with almost the same title ('Pictorum aliquot celebrium, pr√¶cipu√© Germani√¶ Inferioris', in English: 'Effigies of some celebrated painters, chiefly of Lower Germany') that contained 69 engraved portraits of painters. Hondius' work included in its first part reworked versions of 22 of the portraits of the 1572 publication. The portrait of Hieronymus Cock (often numbered 23) was not included by Hondius maybe because the likeness was made after death, rather than drawn \\"ad vivum\\" (after the living model) as was the case for the other portraits.Portrait of Hieronymus Cock in the effigies, Courtauld Institute of Art References  External links   Category:1518 births Category:1570 deaths Category:Flemish printers Category:Flemish painters Category:Flemish artists (before 1830) Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:People from Antwerp ","title":"Hieronymus Cock"},{"id":"8096380","text":"Ephraim Franklin Morgan (January 16, 1869January 15, 1950) was a Republican politician who served as the Governor of West Virginia from 1921 to 1925. He was born on a farm near Forksburg, Marion County, West Virginia, a descendant of the first white settler of western Virginia, Morgan Morgan, and his son David Morgan. He studied at Fairmont State Normal School and graduated from the West Virginia University law school in 1897. After establishing a law practice in Fairmont, Morgan enlisted in the First West Virginia Infantry during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Following the war, he became the Fairmont city attorney. He served as a judge of the Marion County Intermediate Court from 1907 to 1912 and as a member of the West Virginia Public Service Commission from 1915 to 1920. In 1902, he married Alma Bennett.\\"West Virginia's First Ladies,\\" West Virginia Division of Culture and History, June 2007. At the time Morgan became governor, a virtual state of war existed between union coal miners and coal operators. The United Mine Workers union was protesting for the right to organize miners in the southwestern part of the state. In late summer 1921, the governor called upon President Warren G. Harding to dispatch federal troops to end an armed miners' march in Boone and Logan counties. After the conflict ended, Morgan used National Guard troops to discourage miners from again taking up arms. A more detailed discussion of the 1921 armed miners' march and the Battle of Blair Mountain can be found in Clayton D. Laurie's \\"The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920‚Äì1921\\" in West Virginia History, Volume 50 (1991). Under Morgan, the legislature created a sinking fund to provide financial assistance to new programs, namely a new road system. He appointed a Capitol Commission to devise a plan for replacing the old state capitol, which was destroyed by fire on January 3, 1921. The west wing of the present state capitol was completed in 1925. One week before leaving office, Ephraim and Alma Morgan became the first residents of the present West Virginia Governor's Mansion. After his term as governor, Morgan served as solicitor for the United States Department of Commerce before retiring in Fairmont, West Virginia. In 1940, he was defeated for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. He died in Bethesda, Maryland, on January 15, 1950, one day before his 81st birthday.

A mid-deck oil tanker is a tanker design which includes an additional deck intended to limit spills if the tanker is damaged. The extra deck is placed at about the middle of the draft of the ship. This design is an alternative to the double-hull tanker design, and is superior in terms of spill volume. Although double-hull design is superior in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull and into the sea. In grounding events of this type, a mid-deck design overcomes this by eliminating the double-bottom compartments that are void with air. Since the density of seawater is greater than that of oil, water comes into the tanks instead of oil escaping out, and rather than spilling, oil is vented upwards into overflow tanks. A variation on the mid-deck tanker is the Coulombi Egg Tanker, which was approved by IMO as an alternative to the double hull concept. The United States Coast Guard does not allow this design to enter US waters, effectively preventing it from being built, although it is superior to the double hull in high energy casualties.

The Orpheum, which still stands today, was substantially rebuilt in 1915 by architect Thomas W. Lamb as a movie theater. The hall has no connection with Boston's \\"Music Hall\\", a theater which is now known as the Wang Theatre. History The Boston Music Hall was built in 1852, thanks to a donation of $100,000, made by the Harvard Musical Association, for its construction. The Handel and Haydn Society performed at the hall's inaugural concert. The hall was the first home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1881 and was also the birthplace of the New England Conservatory of Music. The BSO performed the American premiere of the Piano Concerto No. 1, by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky here. After being threatened by road building and subway construction, the Music Hall was replaced as the home of the Boston Symphony in 1900, by Symphony Hall. In addition to concerts, the hall presented important speakers of the time. Methodist minister Henry Morgan lectured in the hall ca.1859.Samuel Austin Allibonert.

Organ The Boston Music Hall Organ The \\"new\\" organ in a stereoscopic image by Bierstadt Brothers The Boston Music Hall Organ, installed in 1862, was the first concert pipe organ installed in the United States. It was commissioned in 1857 and built in Germany by E.F. Walcker and Company of Ludwigsburg. It was the largest in the US at the time, containing 5,474 pipes and 84 registers. The organ was removed from the Music Hall in 1884 to provide more performing space for the Boston Symphony. Initially put into storage, the organ was rebuilt and installed by the Methuen Organ Company in the Serlo Organ Hall in Methuen, Massachusetts, which was built to house the organ. The organ was later rebuilt again and augmented by the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company. Today Serlo Organ Hall is known as the Methuen Memorial Music Hall and concerts are regularly presented on the organ, still considered one of the leading instruments in the US. Orpheum Theatre When the Boston Symphony moved to Symphony Hall in 1900, the Boston Music Hall closed. It was converted for use as a vaudeville theater in 1900 and operated under a number of different names, including the Music Hall and the Empire Theatre. In 1906, it was renamed the Orpheum Theatre. In 1915, the theater was acquired by the Loew's Theatres chain and reopened again in 1916, rebuilt with a completely new interior, designed by architect Thomas W. Lamb.

In August 2000, Smith converted the drawings to digital art and launched a website, allowing users to virtually play with a dress-up doll by placing movable layers of clothing on top of a crucified Jesus. Outfits in the original version included a light-blue tuxedo, football uniform, snorkeling gear, and red devil pajamas. Internet reach Sarah Silverman holding the magnets Within a month of its launch, JesusDressUp.com received over 150,000 original hits, and by October 2000 had over 250,000 original visits. Almost entirely by word-of-mouth referrals, the website received nearly 6 million monthly hits by the end of 2000. In 2003, Normal Bob Smith produced a companion refrigerator-magnet set, which was sold through the website. Retailer Urban Outfitters ordered 3,000 of the magnet sets for sale through its stores, and Smith estimated he had sold around 5,000 sets in total by March 2004. As of 2012 there are ten versions of the Jesus Dress Up: the original, Superstar, Miscellaneous Holiday, Halloween, Christmas, Final Justice, BDSM, Wizard of Oz, Star Wars and Lady Gaga. Smith has also created a Mohammed Dress Up game, allowing people to dress up the prophet Mohammed. Smith hosts photographs of celebrities including David Cross, Janeane Garofalo and Sarah Silverman holding the Jesus Dress Up magnet set on his website, and has also posted a YouTube video of himself giving a set to Richard Dawkins. Jesus Dress Up magnets appeared in the segment on Normal Bob Smith in the Neil Abramson documentary film Bob Smith USA, which premiered at the American Film Institute‚Äôs SilverDocs Film Festival in Washington DC in June 2005. Response On March 14, 2004, Jesus Dress Up sparked national controversy when a Philadelphia man, known only as \\"Gerry\\", voiced his outrage after seeing the magnets at an Urban Outfitters store in the King of Prussia mall. He wrote a letter of complaint to the chain and brought his story to his local NBC affiliate WCAU-TV when he received their response: Urban Outfitters stated that the magnet was not being sold to offend anyone, but to reflect a diversity of opinion among its customer base. Urban Outfitters received more than 250,000 complaints, due mostly to organizational efforts from OneMillionMoms.com and OneMillionDads.com, activism group websites created by the American Family Association. Following the controversy on March 17, Urban Outfitters cancelled an order for an additional 3,500 magnet sets and publicly stated that while they would sell their remaining stock they would not order any more. As a result of this attention, on March 28, 2004, an activism group called Laptop Lobbyists alerted Normal Bob Smith's web-hosting company, Pick Internet Solutions Inc, and succeeded in shutting down the Jesus Dress Up site. Charles Wheelus, President of Pick Internet Solutions Inc., said in response to the protests, \\"I am as appalled as you. I find the content of these sites to be obscene and offending.\\" Austin Cline from About.com commented that he hoped Normal Bob Smith would find a new hosting service, \\"one with a bit more backbone and a bit more respect for the existence of different points of view.\\" JesusDressUp.com was offline for several days until a new web hosting service was found.

He continued his studies and received an Artium Magister degree in 1873 from the same institution. He also took graduate level courses from Mount Union College, a Methodist-affiliated institution founded in 1845 in Alliance, Ohio, which would award him a PhD \\"pro merito\\" in 1887. In 1871 he moved to either Nashville, Tennessee or Washington, D.C. for legal studies, ultimately receiving a Bachelor of Laws in 1874 from Howard University School of Law.

For part of this period, Atkinson also collected tolls for the Kanawha River Board (1869 to 1871). He was also the postmaster for Kanawha Courthouse (now Charleston) from 1871 to 1877. Shortly after graduating from Howard's law school, Atkinson was admitted to the West Virginia bar, beginning a private practice in Charleston from 1875 to 1877. In the final year (1876), he was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates.\\"George W. Atkinson\\" in Johnson, Rossiter, ed.. Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans. vol. 1 Boston, MA, USA: The Biographical Society (1904) available on ancestry.com Atkinson moved to Wheeling in 1877, and edited the Wheeling Standard from 1877 to 1878. Atkinson then received his next federal job, as revenue agent for the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) of the United States Department of the Treasury in Wheeling from 1879 to 1881. He then became the United States Marshal for the District of West Virginia from 1881 to 1885. Congressional service Atkinson ran for Congress as a Republican to represent West Virginia's 1st congressional district. Although he appeared to lose, he successfully contested the election of United States Representative John O. Pendleton to the United States House of Representatives of the 51st United States Congress, so served approximately the final year of the term, from February 26, 1890, to March 3, 1891. Atkinson did not run for reelection in 1890. Newspaperman Following his departure from Congress, Atkinson returned to his legal practice from 1891 to 1896 as well as the newspaper business. He became editor of the West Virginia Journal in Wheeling during the same period. Governor Atkinson upset Democrat Cornelius C. Watts to become the 10th Governor of West Virginia, serving from 1897 to 1901. Democrats had ruled the state for 26 years, but West Virginia faced a fiscal crisis. Atkinson worked against corruption in politics and professional lobbying. He also negotiated with Republican party leader and U.S. Senator Stephen B. Elkins, who eventually agreed to a tax increase. However, concessions split the party's reform wing. Nonetheless, Atkinson worked for an eight-hour workday, to prohibit employing children under 14 years of age, improved working conditions for women, and safety regulations in manufacturing and mining. In addition to speaking out against racist Jim Crow legislation being adopted by neighboring states which disenfranchised most blacks and poor whites, Atkinson championed high-quality public education, a permanent road system, and open and equal immigration. After Atkinson's gubernatorial term ended, President Roosevelt named him (and the Senate confirmed him as) the United States Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, a position he held from 1901 to 1905.Southern District of West Virginia history page Federal judge President Theodore Roosevelt on April 15, 1905 gave Atkinson received a recess appointment, to a seat on the Court of Claims (later the United States Court of Claims) vacated by Judge Lawrence Weldon. Roosevelt formally nominated Atkinson for the post on December 5, 1905. Confirmed by the United States Senate on January 16, 1906, Atkinson received his commission the same day. He resigned on April 16, 1916, months before his 71st birthday. Final years and publications Atkinson returned to Charleston and continued to write, as well as remained active in the Republican Party. In 1918 he supported the candidacy of T.

It is located north of Oregon Route 7, near the Middle Fork John Day River in the Malheur National Forest. History Austin was named for Minot and Linda Austin, early settlers of the area. The Austins operated a small store and hotel, Austin House. Austin House was started as a hotel and stagecoach station by a Mr. Newton. Austin post office was established in 1888 and closed in 1950. The tracks of the Sumpter Valley Railway reached Austin in 1905. The railway was built by Oregon Lumber Company and Austin became an important railroad logging community. Austin was the hub of the area until Bates, a company town of the Oregon Lumber Company, was built to the west. Austin was also a supply depot for local mining towns, including Susanville and Galena. Austin sawmills supplied lumber for places such as Greenhorn and the Bonanza Mine, higher up in the Blue Mountains. At its height, the population was about 500 (some estimates say it was high as 5,000) and the community had three sawmills. The town also had a substantial jail and the offices of several doctors, lawyers and real estate operators. As the neighboring mining towns disappeared, however, Austin also went into decline. By 1997, a newer business called Austin House was the only business remaining in the Austin area, at Austin Junction where Oregon Route 7 meets U.S. Route 26. Built in 1959, the business is about from the original site of Austin and serves as a combination tavern, grocery store, restaurant and gas station. As of 2002, fewer than 35 people lived within a radius of Austin.

A co-founder of the Journal of Indo-European Studies, Littleton was an expert on Indo-European mythology and Shinto, on which he was the author of numerous works. Biography Covincton Scott Littleton was born in Los Angeles, California on July 1, 1933, and grew up in Hermosa Beach, California. He was the son of Covington Scott (an investigator and writer) and Adelaide Littleton. Littleton served in the United States Army in Korea during the Korean War, having lied about his age in order to get into the army. Attending El Camino College from 1952 to 1954, Littleton subsequently studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he received his A.B. (with the highest honors) in 1957, M.A. in 1962, and Ph.D in anthropology in 1965. He was the Graduate Commencement Speaker at University of California, Los Angeles in 1965. Littleton's 1965 PhD dissertion was published in 1966 under the title The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of Georges Dum√©zil. He played an important role in disseminating Dum√©zil's theories Trifunctional hypothesis to an English-speaking audience. Littleton's work on the theories of Dum√©zil is still considered the most comprehensive source on the subject. Littleton was a research assistant in folklore center at University of California, Los Angeles from 1961 to 1962. Since 1962, Littleton worked as Occidental College as Assistant Professor of Anthropology (1962-68), Associate Professor of Anthropology (1968-80), Chair of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology (1967-72, 1974-93), and Professor of Anthropology and Chair of the Department of Anthropology (1994-98).

Examples Logbook Example 1 shows a logbook can combine readings from multiple meters (such as one at home and another at work or school) in one place. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner readings are lined up vertically to help look for trends. The logbook automatically colors the box red for a low blood sugar, and blue for a high blood sugar. In the example chart, a pattern is easy to visualize: mornings tend to be a bit high (more insulin is needed at night) and there is a pattern of lows occurring after dinner (perhaps dinner insulin or the afternoon basal rates could be turned down). Standard day data plots The Standard day data plots, see example 2, shows that trends are easy to see. The blood glucose readings are plotted at their level versus the time of day. Multiple days are plotted on top of each other, creating a scatter of points. In the example shown, it is easy to see the glycemic excursions to high blood sugars following breakfast and lunch. Once identified, this can be improved by using a faster acting insulin, or injecting insulin 20 minutes before eating, or by selecting carbohydrates to eat that are slower to peak in the bloodstream. Pie charts Example 3 shows that pie charts are a quick way to judge performance of insulin doses throughout the day relative to the goal of keeping 75% of premeal blood glucose readings within boundaries. Sub-charts automatically break down to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night, as well as show pre-meal versus post-meal statistics. In the example pie chart shown, it appears there is an opportunity to improve morning lows and afternoon highs with insulin adjustments. Daily views Example 4 evaluates the delivery from an insulin pump, showing blood glucose plots along the top, carbohydrates eaten (bubbles in the middle of the chart), basal and bolus insulin delivered at the bottom. This is a good example of the flexibility in lifestyle afforded to an insulin pump user as carbohydrates are not \\"scheduled\\" to match insulin profiles, and yet the glycemic excursions are well controlled. In this chart, it is also easy to see that the pump user had a meal at 3pm but forgot to test blood glucose beforehand. Basal pattern control Example 5 shows a control screen for basal delivery from an insulin pump. Time of day and basal rate in units per hour can be modified to create a custom basal rate pattern to match the insulin needs of the pump user. Icons are shown which save or read data from the PC, or to upload and download it from the pump. Bolus control Example 6 shows bolus control on this screen. The insulin to carbohydrate ratio is stored in the pump as a function of the meal eaten (time of day). This screen selects grams of carbohydrate as the input parameter from the user, such that the pump can calculate the insulin bolus desired from the grams entered and the insulin to carb ratio that is stored. CGMS Example 7 shows a data plot from a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). This plot shows the blood sugar levels between meals and also during the night, when other BG testing methods using a finger prick sample would typically miss the data available between samples. CGMS data is a new technology that it intended to give immediate feedback between finger sticks and also predict (by extrapolation) what may be happening soon to give the diabetic person a chance to correct a high or low blood sugar condition before it becomes urgent. This curve also illustrates the dawn effect. Prediction Example 8 shows a data plot from a continuous glucose prediction system (CGPS). This plot shows the blood sugar levels between meals and also during the night, when other BG testing methods using a finger prick sample would typically miss the data available between samples. CGPS is a new technology that it intended to give immediate feedback between finger sticks and also predict what may be happening soon to give the person with diabetes a chance to correct a high or low blood sugar condition before it becomes urgent. Globally, an estimated 422 million adults are living with diabetes mellitus, according to the latest 2016 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Diabetes prevalence is increasing rapidly; previous 2013 estimates from the International Diabetes Federation put the number at 381 million people having diabetes. The number is projected to almost double by 2030. Type 2 diabetes makes up about 85-90% of all cases. Increases in the overall diabetes prevalence rates largely reflect an increase in risk factors for type 2, notably greater longevity and being overweight. Diabetes mellitus occurs throughout the world, but is more common is type 2 diabetes in the more developed countries. The greatest increase in prevalence is, however, occurring in low- and middle-income countries including in Asia and Africa, where most patients will probably be found by 2030. The increase in incidence in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, including increasingly sedentary lifestyles, less physically demanding work and the global nutrition transition, marked by increased intake of foods that are high energy-dense but nutrient-poor (often high in sugar and saturated fats, sometimes referred to as the Western pattern diet). The risk of getting type 2 diabetes has been widely found to be associated with lower socio-economic position across countries.[3,6] The WHO estimates that diabetes resulted in 1.5 million deaths in 2012, making it the 8th leading cause of death. However another 2.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of associated complications (e.g. heart disease, stroke, kidney failure), which often result in premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes.[5] The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. The global prevalence of diabetes among adults over 18 years of age has risen from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014. Diabetes prevalence has been rising more rapidly in middle- and low-income countries. Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. In 2012, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes and another 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose. Half of all deaths attributable to high blood glucose occur before the age of 70 years. WHO projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death in 2030 . Healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complications.[6] Epidemiologic patterns of T1D by demographic, geographic, biologic, cultural and other factors in populations are presented to gain insight about the etiology, natural history, risks, and complications of T1D. Data from large epidemiologic studies worldwide indicate that the incidence of T1D has been increasing by 2‚Äì5% worldwide and that the prevalence of T1D is approximately 1 in 300 in the US by 18 years of age. Research on risk factors for T1D is an active area of research to identify genetic and environmental triggers that could potentially be targeted for intervention. While significant advances have been made in the clinical care of T1D with resultant improvements in quality of life and clinical outcomes, much more needs to be done to improve care of, and ultimately find a cure for T1D. Epidemiologic studies have an important on-going role to investigate the complex causes, clinical care, prevention, and cure of T1D.

Critical care nurses can be found working in a wide variety of environments and specialties, such as general intensive care units, medical intensive care units, surgical intensive care units, trauma intensive care units, coronary care units, cardiothoracic intensive care units, burns unit, paediatrics and some trauma center emergency departments. These specialists generally take care of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation by way of endotracheal intubation and/or titratable vasoactive intravenous medications.  Specific jobs and personal qualities  Critical care nurses are also known as ICU nurses. They treat patients who are acutely ill and unstable requiring more frequent nursing assessments and the utilization of life sustaining technology and drugs. Although many ICU patients have chronic health issues, patients are in the ICU for an acute pathology or an exacerbation of a chronic pathology. ICU nurses apply their specialized knowledge base to care for and maintain the life support of critically ill patients who are often on the verge of death. On a day-to-day basis a critical care nurse will commonly, \\"perform assessments of critical conditions, give intensive and intervention, advocate for their patients, and operate/maintain life support systems which include mechanical ventilation via endotracheal, tracheal, or nasotracheal intubation, and titration of continuous vasoactive intravenous medications in order to maintain a \\" mean arterial pressure that ensures adequate organ and tissue perfusion.\\"Critical Care Nurse.\\" DiscoverNursing.com. Johnson & Johnson Services, 3 Jan. 2013. Web. 17 Nov. 2013.  Training and education  Critical care nurses in the U.S. are trained in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), and many earn certification in acute and critical care nursing (CCRN) through the American Association of Critical‚ÄìCare Nurses. Due to the unstable nature of the patient population, LPN/LVNs are rarely utilized in a primary care role in the intensive care unit. However, with proper training and experience LPN/LVNs can play a significant role in providing exceptional bedside care for the critically ill patient. To become a critical care nurse, one must first achieve an associate or bachelor's degree in nursing and pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN). Once the exam is passed, then someone can start working as a regular registered nurse (RN). After getting hired into a critical care area, additional specialized training is usually given to the nurse. After 1750 hours of providing direct bedside care in a critical care area, a nurse can then sit for the CCRN exam. The American Association of Critical Care Nurses advisory board sets and maintains standards for critical care nurses. The certification offered by this board is known as CCRN. Depending on the hospital and State, the RN will be required to take a certain amount of continuing education hours to stay up to date with the current technologies and changing techniques.Critical Care Nurse This image indicates the traumatic and stressful environment a Critical Care Nurse works in. Registration is a regulatory term for the process that occurs between the individual nurse and the state in which the nurse practices. All nurses in the US are registered as nurses without a specialty. The CCRN is an example of a post registration specialty certification in critical care. There are also variants of critical care certification test that the AACN offers to allow nurses to certify in progressive care (PCCN), cardiac medicine (CMC) and cardiac surgery (CSC). In addition, Clinical Nurse Specialists can certify in adult, neonatal and pediatric acute and critical care (CCNS). In November 2007, the AACN Certification Corporation launched the ACNPC, an advanced practice certification examination for Acute Care Nurse Practitioners . None of these certifications confer any additional practice privileges, as nursing practice is regulated by the individual's state board of nursing. These certifications are not required to work in an intensive care unit, but are encouraged by employers, as the tests for these certifications tend to be difficult to pass and require an extensive knowledge of both pathophysiology and critical care medical and nursing practices. The certification, while difficult to obtain, is looked upon by many in the field as demonstrating expertise in the field of critical care nursing, and demonstrating the individual's nurse's desire to advance their knowledge base and skill set, thereby allowing them to better care for their patients. Intensive care nurses are also required to be comfortable with a wide variety of technology and its uses in the critical care setting. This technology includes such equipment as hemodynamic and cardiac monitoring systems, mechanical ventilator therapy, intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP), ventricular assist devices (LVAD and RVAD), continuous renal replacement equipment (CRRT/CVVHDF), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits (ECMO) and many other advanced life support devices. The training for the use of this equipment is provided through a network of in- hospital inservices, manufacturer training, and many hours of education time with experienced operators. Annual continuing education is required by most states in the U.S. and by many employers to ensure that all skills are kept up to date. Many intensive care unit management teams will send their nurses to conferences to ensure that the staff is kept up to the current state of this rapidly changing technology. In Australia there is no compulsory prerequisite for critical care nurses to have postgraduate qualifications. However, the Australian minimum standard recommends that critical care nurses should obtain postgraduate qualifications. Critical care nurses must have a bachelor of nursing, be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, and meet the NMBA‚Äôs standards in order to work as a critical care nurse in Australia.  Employment areas  Critical care nurses work in a variety of different areas, with a diverse patient population. There are many critical care nurses working in hospitals in intensive care units, post-operative care and high dependency units. They also work on medical evacuation and transport teams. In August 2004, to demonstrate the work of critical care nurses Massachusetts General Hospital invited reporter Scott Allen and photographer Michelle McDonald from The Boston Globe to take part in an 'immersion experience' in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). The Globe staffers spent eight months shadowing an experienced nurse and a trainee nurse to learn about nursing practice first hand. The result was a four-part, front-page series that ran from October 23 to 26, 2005, entitled Critical Care: The making of an ICU nurse. The added psychological stress of nursing in critical care units has been well-documented, and it has been argued the stress experienced in ICU areas are unique in the profession.  Patient interaction  According to Washington, no matter their specialty, all nurses must be able to build trusting relationships with their patients. When the nurses develop strong relationships between their patients they are able to obtain important information about them that may be helpful to diagnosing them. Also, family members that become involved in this relationship make it easier for the nurses to build these trusting relationships with the patients because the family members could ease any stress that could lead the patient to be timid. When a patient has a long-term illness, the good relationships built between the nurse and patient can improve the patient's quality of life.GT, Washington. \\"Trust: A Critical Element in Critical Care Nursing.\\" NCBI. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1990. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.  Subspecialities  Critical care nurses can specialize in several different areas based on either the patient‚Äôs age or the illness/injury that the patient has. Geriatric patients are considered to be people over the age of 65 and nurses that specialize in geriatrics work in an adult intensive care unit (ICU). Pediatric patients are children under the age of 18, a nurse that works with very sick children would work in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Finally, a child is considered a neonatal patient from the time they are born to when they leave the hospital. If a child is born with a life-threatening illness the child would be transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Also, the location that the CCRN works can vary. Some places that they can work most commonly include hospitals: in regular or specialized intensive care units. Uncommonly they can work at some patients‚Äô homes, in some flight centers and outpatient facilities. The specialty areas of the critical care nurses can also be based on the patient‚Äôs illness or injury. For example, a unit that is an adult intensive care unit, specialized in the care of trauma patients would be an adult trauma intensive care unit. The focus of the unit is generally on either an adult or a pediatric/neonatal population, as the treatment methods differ for the age ranges. Another example could include an intensive care unit solely to care for patients directly before and after a major or minor surgery.Villanova University  Statistics  Depending on the location, critical care nurses work approximately 31.7 hours a week. In South Australia critical are nurses are recorded to work approximately 28.2 hours a week. While in the Northern Territory critical care nurses have been documented to work 31.7 hours a week. Tasmania has the largest percentage of nurses working part time with 71.8%, while the Northern Territory has the lowest with 18.4%.  Salary  Critical care nurses are specialty nurses; because of this, they require more in depth and specialized training than regular RNs do. Therefore, their salaries are usually higher compared to basic RN‚Äôs because of the more intense work that they do day to day. The national average salary for a CCRN is around $69,110. However, in the top percentile salaries can reach $96,630. It all depends on the job and where they are workingParker, Mike. \\"The Salary of a CCRN.\\" Work. Hearst Communications, n.d. Web. 07 Nov. 2013. Critical care nurses in Australia do not need to have extra training than regular RNs do unless they have completed a postgraduate qualification. Therefore, their salaries are usually similar. Pay levels in nursing are bases on the position/level and experience. The average salary are approximately $55,617 for level 1.1, $57,841 for level 1.2, $60,155 for level 1.3, $62,561 for level 1.4, $65,063 for level 1.5, $67,666 for level 1.6, $70,373 for level 1.7, $73,187 for level 1.8, $75,488 for level 2.1, $77,028 for level 2.2, $78,600 for level 2.3 and $80,204 for level 2.4.

It is isolated in the high desert of the western United States, and lies directly on the state line, the 42nd parallel, between Idaho and Nevada. The reservation, in the shape of a square, is almost evenly divided in land area between the two states, with the northern 50.2 percent in southern Owyhee County, Idaho and the southern 49.8 percent in northwestern Elko County, Nevada. The total land area is . A resident population of 1,265 persons was reported in the 2000 census, more than 80 percent of whom lived on the Nevada side. In October 2016 the Nevada Native Nations Land Act was passed to put Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service lands into trust for six federally recognized tribes in the state. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribe will have 82 acres of Forest Service land added to their reservation. Some other tribes are receiving thousands of acres of trust lands. Gaming is prohibited on the new lands.\\"Nevada Native Nations Land Act\\" , Propublica website; accessed 30 November 2016 The only significant community on the reservation is Owyhee, Nevada, at an elevation of above sea level. Owyhee is nearly equidistant from the two nearest major cities: north of Elko, Nevada, the county seat of the county by that name; and south of Mountain Home, Idaho. History On April 16, 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes established the Duck Valley Western Shoshone Reservation by Executive Order; it was also used for Northern Paiute people. Despite the Native Americans having a designated reservation, local settlers and some politicians tried to force the tribal members off the valuable Duck Valley lands in 1884, suggesting they should join their Western Shoshone kinsmen at the reservation at Fort Hall, Idaho. The bands' chiefs successfully resisted these efforts to be displaced from their lands. Meanwhile, the Northern Paiute band joined with another branch of Shoshone in the Bannock War of 1878. Survivors were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp at the Yakama Indian Reservation in Yakima County, Washington. Upon their release, the Northern Paiute returned to the Duck Valley. President Grover Cleveland expanded the reservation by Executive Order on May 4, 1886 to accommodate the Paiute. President William Howard Taft expanded the reservation to its current size by Executive Order on July 1, 1910. It was unusual to have two federal government actions to enlarge the reservation after it was established; most federal actions have been taken to reduce the size of Indian reservations. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribe of Duck Valley is one of five federally recognized tribes in the state of Idaho, each of which have reservations. The others are the Coeur d'Alene, Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, Nez Perce, and Shoshone-Bannock. It is one of several federally recognized tribes in Nevada, some of which include other Shoshone and Paiute bands.

They have glossy blue or green upper parts, which is due to hollow melanin granules arranged in a single layer near the feather barbule's surface. This unique arrangement led to some glossy starlings formerly placed in the genus Spreo being transferred to Lamprotornis, since they shared this feature (but see also below). The genus Lamprotornis was introduce by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820. The type species was subsequently designated as the long-tailed glossy starling. The under parts of these species lack iridescence. They may be blue, purple, yellow or brown. Most Lamprotornis starlings have striking yellow or red irides and some have long tails. These glossy starlings are found in a variety of habitats from forests to open woodland and gardens. They nest in tree holes, either natural, or made by woodpeckers or barbets, and some will use man-made structures. Most species are resident apart from seasonal or local movement, but Shelley's starling is migratory. Most species are gregarious outside the breeding season. Lamprotornis glossy-starlings are omnivorous and mostly feed on the ground, although they will take fruit from trees. Some will feed on or near large mammals to find insects. Species The genus contains 23 species. *Cape starling, Lamprotornis nitens *Greater blue-eared starling, Lamprotornis chalybaeus *Lesser blue-eared starling, Lamprotornis chloropterus *Miombo blue-eared starling, Lamprotornis elisabeth *Bronze-tailed starling, Lamprotornis chalcurus *Splendid starling, Lamprotornis splendidus *Principe starling, Lamprotornis ornatus *Emerald starling, Lamprotornis iris *Purple starling, Lamprotornis purpureus *R√ºppell's starling, Lamprotornis purpuroptera *Long-tailed glossy starling, Lamprotornis caudatus *Golden- breasted starling, Lamprotornis regius *Meves's starling, Lamprotornis mevesii *Burchell's starling, Lamprotornis australis *Sharp-tailed starling, Lamprotornis acuticaudus *Superb starling, Lamprotornis superbus *Hildebrandt's starling, Lamprotornis hildebrandti *Shelley's starling, Lamprotornis shelleyi *Chestnut-bellied starling, Lamprotornis pulcher *Ashy starling, Lamprotornis unicolor *Fischer's starling, Lamprotornis fischeri *Pied starling, Lamprotornis bicolor *White-crowned starling, Lamprotornis albicapillus The limits of this genus require revision. For example, the black-bellied starling is sometimes placed in a separate genus Notopholia, and it (and possibly others) appears to be indeed well distinct. On the other hand, genera such as Coccycolius, Spreo and Compsarus are sometimes included in Lamprotornis.(Zuccon et al. 2006) References *Feare, Chris & Craig, Adrian (1999): Starlings and Mynas.

The Austrian Black and Tan Hound is a breed of dog originating in Austria.  History  There is no known history of the Austrian Black and Tan Hound until after the middle of the 19th century. This large sized hound was used for tracking wounded game, most commonly hare, in high altitudes.  Description   Appearance  Colouring in this breed is highly important; it must be black with small, clearly defined, light to dark fawn markings. Two fawn marks above the eyes must be present. The coat is smooth, dense and short (about 2 cm in length). The long tail is slightly bent and the ears are medium in length and lie flat with rounded tips. Males are , while females are . They weigh 15 to 22 kg (33-49 pounds).  Temperament  It has a keen sense of smell. It is an elegant runner, used in all sorts of game. It has a lovely voice, and makes a great pet due to its good-natured personality. It is not a dog wanting to be in a city. A suitable home will be in a rural area where the dog will have much space to run unrestricted by a leash. It loves to work.  Care  It needs daily exercise. The breed will only require a once-a-week brushing and bathing only when necessary. Nails need to be trimmed regularly and ears need to be cleaned every day to avoid ear infections. There are no genetic diseases known to affect this breed, which is fairly healthy, and lives up to 12 to 14 years of age.  Etymology  Brandlbracke is a compound word, stemming from \\"Brand\\" (harmful fire, fire that went out of control) which refers to the fawn markings and \\"Bracke\\", a type of hunting dog. Vier√§ugl is the Austro-Bavarian diminutive of \\"Vierauge\\", meaning: somebody our something having four eyes. It refers to the distinctive fawn markings above the eyes.

Mathews served as 7th Attorney General of West Virginia (1873‚Äì1877) and 5th Governor of West Virginia (1877‚Äì1881), being the first former Confederate elected to a governorship in the United States. Born into a Virginia political family, Mathews practiced law before the outbreak of the American Civil War. When Virginia seceded from the United States in 1861, he volunteered for the Confederate States Army, where he served in the western theater as a major of artillery. Following the war, Mathews was elected to the West Virginia Senate, but denied the seat due to state restrictions for former Confederates. He participated in the 1872 state constitutional convention that overturned these restrictions, and was thereafter elected attorney general of West Virginia. After one term, he was elected governor of West Virginia. Mathews was identified as a Redeemer, the southern wing of the conservative, pro-business Bourbon faction of the Democratic Party that sought to oust the Radical Republicans who had come to power across the postwar South. However, Mathews took the uncommon practice of appointing members from both parties to important positions, causing his administration to be characterized as \\"an era of good feelings.\\" His administration faced challenges related to the Long Depression, most notably the outbreak of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, as a protest to wage cuts. After several failed attempts to quell the strike, Mathews called on President Rutherford B. Hayes for federal assistance, which brought national attention to the strike that spread to other states in what would be the first national labor strike in United States history. Mathews' handling of the strike was criticized at the time, though the involvement of the federal government in breaking up the strike has come to be seen as inevitable by modern historians. In later life, Mathews served as president of the White Sulfur Springs Company (now the Greenbrier Resort). Early life Henry Mason Mathews was born on March 29, 1834 in Frankford, Virginia, U.S., (located in modern-day West Virginia) to Eliza Shore (n√©e Reynolds) and Mason Mathews.White, p. 431Addkinson-Simmons His father was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and his family had been politically prominent in western Virginia since the beginning of its European settlement in the early 1700s.Callahan, p. 7-9 His ancestry was Scotch-Irish and/or Welsh.Boots Mathews received a primary education at the Lewisburg Academy, and afterward attended the University of Virginia, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1855 and a Master of Arts in 1856. Outside of academics, he was a member of the fraternal organization Beta Theta Pi. In his Masters Thesis, \\"Poetry in America,\\" Mathews reconciled the decline of fine arts in the face of industrialism with the potential for societal advancement such industry might bring, stating, \\"while we may regret to see the art of poetry declining, . ... we know also that this very fact is an evidence of the continual improvement of the mind of man, and of the advancement of the world in the accomplishment of its destiny.\\"Carmichael, p. 29 On the completion of his graduate degree, Mathews entered Lexington Law School and studied under John W. Brockenbrough, graduating in 1857 with a degree of Bachelor of Laws. He was admitted to the bar in the same year, at which point he opened a law office in Lewisburg with his younger brother, Alexander F. Mathews.Callahan, p. 8Combs, p. 15 Soon afterward he accepted the professorship of Language and Literature at Alleghany College, Blue Sulphur Springs, retaining the privilege to practicing law in the courts. Also in 1857, at age 22, Mathews married Lucy Fry Mathews, daughter of Judge Joseph L. Fry. They had 5 children: Lucile \\"Josephine\\", Mason, William Gordon, Henry Edgar, and Laura Herne. Mathews became active in public life in the years proceeding the outbreak of the American Civil War. He did local organizing for Democratic presidential candidate John C. Breckinridge during the 1860 presidential campaign.Rice, p. 251 Breckinridge lost the national vote to Abraham Lincoln, who did not receive a single vote in Mathews' home county of Greenbrier.Rice, p. 254 Nevertheless, Greenbrier opposed secession in the United States, voting against it in the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 the following Spring. When Virginia ultimately decided on secession, Mathews voiced, \\"I am in favor of the preservation of our glorious Union, and a resort to all Constitutional remedies for its restoration. Next to my Bible, I reverence [the] Constitution of my Country & the Union.\\"Rice, p. 257 Military service Brigadier General Alexander W. Reynolds, uncle of Major Henry Mason Mathews Despite Mathews' objection to secession, he chose to follow his home state of Virginia on its joining of the Confederate States of America in May 1861. Mathews, along with his two brothers, volunteered for the Confederate States Army (CSA) at the rank of private.Combs, p. 7 Mathews was assigned to the staff of Brigadier General Henry Wise, who in 1861 engaged in a public feud with fellow CSA general John B. Floyd over authority of the western Virginia region. Mathews' father, Mason Mathews, who was the Virginia House Delegate for Greenbrier County, made field visits to each of the generals, then recommended in writing to Confederate President Jefferson Davis that both be deposed.Rice, p. 264 President Davis removed Floyd from command in Virginia and reassigned him to Fort Donelson in Tennessee. In 1863, Henry Mathews was moved to the staff of his uncle, Brig. Gen. Alexander W. Reynolds, in Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson's division of Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton's army. He was promoted to major of artillery and accompanied the generals throughout the Vicksburg Campaign.Rickard When general Stevenson's division advanced to Baker's Creek for the Battle of Champion Hill, Mathews was left in Vicksburg as the chief of his department. Following the Vicksburg Campaign, Mathews was arrested by orders of General Robert E. Lee after an unintended strategic error. He described the circumstances in a letter to his brother, Capt. Joseph William Mathews: > On the night of the 6th [October 1864], I got into Camp tired and wet, went > to bed and slept very soundly. About midnite a courier brought me a note > that each brigade should move with its own ordnance. By a very dim light and > just aroused, I read the note incorrectly, that each division shall move > with its own ordnance. When I discovered my mistake I explained the matter > to General S[tevenson]. He said that my explanation was perfectly > satisfactory and asked me to make it in writing in order that he might > forward it to Gen. Lee. I did so and just before Lee rec'd the explanation > he ordered S. to arrest me and prefer charges. So here I am in arrest.Combs, > p. 39 Lee dismissed the charges on receipt of the explanation and Mathews returned to his camp. By the end of 1864, Mathews had lost enthusiasm for war and was granted discharge from the Confederate States Army.  Political career  Political rise While at war Mathews' reputation as a fledgling leader had spread through his home state. In a post-war state that was dominated by the Republican party, Mathews, a Democrat, was elected to the West Virginia Senate in 1865 but was not allowed to serve due to the restriction that prohibited former Confederates from holding public office. As Democratic support increased in subsequent years, state Republicans amended the West Virginia State Constitution to return state rights to former Confederates in an attempt to appeal to voters. However, the effort backfired as the Democratic party quickly regained control of the legislature. Mathews was sent as a Democratic delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1872 to overhaul the 1863 Republican-drafted state constitution. The drafting of this new constitution, of which Mathews was a part, enabled his rise in the politics of the state. The following year, 1873, Mathews was elected 7th attorney general of the state under Governor John J. Jacobs, succeeding Joseph Sprigg, and served one term in which his popularity within his party rose. An 1870s political cartoon calling for \\"Death to Bourbonism\\" At the conclusion of his term as attorney general, Mathews defeated Republican Nathan Goff by 15,000 votes in the most one-sided race for governor in state history at that time. Thus, on March 4, 1877, Mathews became 5th governor of West Virginia, and the first Confederate veteran in the United States to be elected to a governorship.NGA Mathews' conservative, pro-business platform aligned him with the Bourbon Democratic movement sweeping the South. Mathews was the first of the Bourbons to ascend to a governorship, though many would follow all over the South in the 1880s. Governor of West Virginia In his inaugural address, Mathews emphasized unity and progression in the wake of war, promising: > The legitimate results of the war have been accepted in good faith, and > political parties are no longer aligned upon the dead issues of the past. We > have ceased to look back mournfully, and have said \\"Let the dead past bury > its dead,\\" and with reorganized forces have moved up to the living issues of > the present. Mathews' address was well-received across the state. The Republican Morgantown Post praised Mathews' \\"broad, manly, and liberal address, which possesses, to our mind, an honesty of purpose, and a freedom from disguise, that is truly refreshing. . . The skies are brightening all around, and argue well for a long lease of the best fraternal feeling.\\"Fast, p. 184 Mathews' inauguration, one \\"of flowers and flags and banners and music, feasting and revelry,\\" had been a more elaborate affair than previous gubernatorial inaugurations had been, setting a precedent in the state that has continued to the present. On assembling his cabinet, Mathews sought \\"perfect peace, that fighting might cease.\\"Fast, p. 185 He appointed both Republican and Democratic party members to his cabinet, a move that was uncommon in the post-war political climate. Blockade of engines at Martinsburg, West Virginia, July 16, 1877 Great Railroad Strike Awaiting Mathews in office were economic woes associated with the Panic of 1873 and the subsequent Long Depression. In July 1877, four months into his term, he was alerted that Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) workers in Martinsburg, West Virginia, had been stopping trains to protest wage cuts. Mathews called out local militia under Colonel Charles J. Faulkner to disperse the protest, but unbeknownst to Mathews, several in the company were rail workers themselves, and many others were sympathetic to the strike. The militia acted indecisively on arrival, and in the confusion a striker named William Vandergriff fired on the militia and was mortally wounded by return fire. Local papers blamed Mathews for the death and deemed Vandergriff a \\"martyr.\\" The militia officially conveyed to Mathews that they would thereon refuse his orders. Mathews responded by sending another militia company‚Äîthis time making sure no rail workers were among them‚Äîto address the growing strike, but he was informed that this company too would not act against the strikers.Bellesiles, p.149 Mathews finally complied with the urging of his administration to request Federal troops from newly elected President Rutherford B. Hayes. Mathews' decision to call for federal support garnered significant national notice to the strikes. Local newspapers were highly critical of the governor's characterization of the strikes to Hayes as an \\"insurrection\\" rather than an act of desperation, with one notable paper recorded a striking worker's perspective that, \\"[he] had might as well die by the bullet as to starve to death by inches.\\"Caplinger Mathews' decision to call for federal assistance has been vindicated by historians, who have come to view federal involvement as inevitable. Hayes had vowed not to involve the Federal government in domestic matters during his candidacy several months prior, and he sought to solve the matter diplomatically. After failed negotiations with leaders of the railway \\"insurrection,\\" he reluctantly dispatched Federal troops to Martinsburg. However, by this time the strike, by then referred to as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, had reverted to peaceful protest in Martinsburg while violence spread to Maryland, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Missouri. The strike gained considerable support in other states across the country. In 1880, Mathews was again required to dispatch the militia, this time to Hawks Nest, Fayette County, to stop the state's first major coal strike, as miners from Hawks Nest were being threatened with violence to cease productivity by a rival constituent. Relocating the capital West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia. Charleston was made the state's permanent state capital during Mathews' administration.Rice, p.475-476 From 1863, when West Virginia was formed, through 1875, the capital of West Virginia had traveled between Wheeling and Charleston, with its location largely dependent on political party control of the state, with Republicans favoring Wheeling and Democrats favoring Charleston. Early in Mathews' administration, a vote was held to determine a permanent location for the capital, which was currently located in Wheeling. Three options of Charleston, Clarksburg, and Martinsurg were presented (Wheeling was not listed as a voting option). During the campaigning, state Democrats employed a young Booker T. Washington to engage in a speaking tour to consolidate black opinion in favor of Charleston. Charleston won the vote, and has remained the state capital since. State debt and treasury Questions of debt owed by West Virginia to Virginia persisted throughout Mathews' term in office. The question arose quickly when in 1863 West Virginia was created from the northwestern Virginia region. While both states recognized that a debt existed, determining the value of the debt proved difficult. Virginia authorities had determined that West Virginia should assume approximately one-third of the state debt as of January 1, 1861 ‚Äî the year Virginia was seceded from the United States, determining West Virginia's total to be $953,360.32. Mathews' advisers countered with the figure of $525,000. Another figure given to him by the Virginians was $7,000,000, owed by West Virginia to its eastern counterpart. Unable to determine the accuracy of these reports, and recognizing that the question had taken on political meaning, Mathews pursued policy intended to suspend a resolution until the specifics had become clear. His successor, Jacob B. Jackson, inherited the same problem and further suspended the resolution of the matter. The argument dragged on throughout the 1800s and the debt was not retired until 1939. During Mathews' administration, Attorney General Robert White secured a decision by the United States Supreme Court in favor of levying taxes against the burgeoning railroad industry, which to that point had not paid any taxes to the State of West Virginia. This decision resulted in an influx of thousands of dollars into the State treasury. Views on race and slavery Before the Civil War, western Virginia had a relatively low slave population compared to the eastern part of the state, or the South as a whole (4% in western Virginia as compared to about 30% in the South). Mathews' family were among this slave holding population in western Virginia.Combs, p. 22 Mathews' precise views on race and slavery are unclear, though he was a member of several local political conventions that issued statements and resolutions opposing racial equality, both before and after the Civil War.Rice, p. 312 He was also a member of the state convention that wrote the 1872 West Virginia Constitution, which declared that \\"White and colored persons shall not be taught in the same school.\\" Historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor states that the belief of \\"the necessity of racial stratification\\" would have been a common position of a White southerner \\"and a good many prominent Northerners\\" around this time.Pryor, Elizabeth Brown. Reading the Man: A Portrait of Robert E. Lee through his private letters (2008), p. 151. During Mathews' political rise, he was identified as a Redeemer ‚Äì the Southern faction of the Bourbon Democrats. Redeemers dominated Southern politics in most areas from the 1870s to 1910 and were generally led by wealthy former planters, businessmen, and professionals who expelled the freedmen, carpetbaggers, and scalawags from Southern government and reestablished white supremacy in the South. However, West Virginia historian Otis K. Rice objects to this characterization of the West Virginia Redeemers: > This fails to do justice to the flexibility of West Virginia Bourbons. The > West Virginia Democrats who followed the Republican founders of the state > included Governors Mathews, Jackson, Wilson, Fleming, and MacCorkle. These > men were ready to adjust to changing political conditions and to the 13th, > 14th, and 15th amendments to the federal Constitution, which conferred > freedom, citizenship, and the right to vote and hold office upon former > slaves. From 1865 to 1957 West Virginia passed eleven Jim Crow laws under Democratic leadership. None of these were passed during Mathews' administration of 1877 to 1881. In 1881, following the ruling of the Strauder v. West Virginia Supreme Court case, Mathews reversed a 1873 state law that prohibited blacks from serving on juries. Later life White Sulfur Springs Company Mathews retired from politics in 1881, at which point he returned to his law practice. He additionally served as president of the White Sulfur Springs Company (now The Greenbrier resort) following its post-war reopening. The resort became a place for many Southerners and Northerners alike to vacation, and the setting for many famous post-war reconciliations, including the White Sulphur Manifesto, which was the only political position issued by Robert E. Lee after the Civil War, that advocated the merging of the two societies. The resort went on to become a center of regional post-war society. Henry M. Mathews died unexpectedly on April 28, 1884 and is buried in the at the Old Stone Church cemetery in Lewisburg, West Virginia. Legacy Henry M. Mathews on a 2010 Republic of Guinea stamp In policy Mathews was a strict Bourbon Democrat. He established a state immigration bureau to attract new workers to the state, expanded the coal and oil industries, improved transportation, and funded a state geological survey.Rice, p. 457 He was described by West Virginia historian James Callahan as \\"a patriotic, broad, and liberal minded ex- Confederate who had fully accepted the results of the Civil War and was well fitted to lead in meeting living issues.\\" His administration at large has been characterized as \\"an era of good feeling,\\" due to his appointing of Republicans to office during his Democratic tenure.Callahan1913 Fellow West Virginia Governor William A. MacCorkle, in Recollections of Fifty Years of West Virginia (1928), said of him: \\"He was not a good come-and-take debater, but when he had prepared himself to make an oration on the issues of the day, he was splendid. His oratory was easy, smooth, perfectly balanced, his voice was splendidly modulated, his gestures were perfect, and he could make as fine an impression on a rather cultivated audience as any man in the state.\\" Historian Mary L. Rickard, in the Calendar of the Henry Mason Mathews Letters and Papers in the State Department of Archives and History (1941), offered a critical analysis of his administration: \\"At this time there was less wealth per capita in West Virginia than in 1865, the result of which had a pronounced effect upon State politics. Those highest up in the social scale held the highest political positions and the entire organization became dangerously corrupt.\\"Rickard However, West Virginia historian Richard Fast notes that no committee to investigate any alleged scandal or mismanagement was appointed during Mathews' term.
