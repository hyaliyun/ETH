It is based in High Point, North Carolina. The International Casual Furnishings Association (ICFA) is a division of the AHFA, as well as the Specialized Furniture Carriers.  History  The American Home Furnishings Alliance traces its history to the North Carolina Case Workers Association, formed in 1905 by 14 Southern furniture manufacturers in Gainsboro, North Carolina. James T. Ryan was the first executive director and served the group in that capacity for 54 years. Soon after NCCWA was established, manufacturers outside North Carolina began to join the organization. In 1911 the name was changed to the Southern Furniture Manufacturers Association to more accurately reflect the growing membership. Throughout its early years, the purpose of the SFMA was to disseminate the newest management and technical information to members and to act as a watchdog against burdensome regulatory requirements and government intervention. In 1928, a similar organization, the National Association of Furniture Manufacturers, was formed in Chicago to provide these services to furniture manufacturers in the north. Although much of the residential furniture production shifted to the South after the Depression, Chicago remained the home of the largest furniture market, held each January at the American Furniture Mart. During World War II, when all raw materials used for furniture were in short supply, SFMA representatives in Washington were successful in keeping furniture plants from closing altogether. Many manufacturers converted operations to make bunk beds, ammunition boxes and other equipment needed in the war effort. By 1947, the South was responsible for 33 percent of the nation's total furniture production. That year, SFMA created the Furniture Foundation to offer a unique furniture manufacturing and management curriculum at North Carolina State College in Raleigh. During the 1950s, the thrust of the SFMA's efforts was on government controls affecting prices, materials and labor. The 60s saw continued sales growth - and a corresponding expansion in the association's services. Ryan retired in 1965 and the association established the James T. Ryan Award, now known as the Distinguished Service Award, in his honor in 1966. Meanwhile, NAFM was also expanding in the north, establishing the Summer and Casual Furniture Manufacturers Association in 1959, and organizing an associate member division for suppliers in 1964. Later, when NAFM and SFMA merged in 1984 to form the American Furniture Manufacturers Association, the SCFMA and Suppliers Division would become key components in the new organization. In 1993, imports represented roughly 25 percent of all wood household furniture sold in the United States and approximately 6 percent of upholstered household furniture. By 2002, imports had jumped to nearly 48 percent of the wood and 14 percent of the upholstered household furniture markets. In 2003, the AFMA Board of Directors began discussing potential changes to the Association to reflect the changing business models of many of its members. On November 5, 2004, the Board voted to change the organization's name to the American Home Furnishings Alliance and to expand the membership criteria to embrace a broader cross- section of the U.S. home furnishings industry.

The mill was built (in its current location) in 1916 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 33786. History In 1862, a corn and barley mill was moved from Vlagtwedde and rebuilt close to the site of the present mill for miller Johannes van Aalst. This mill burnt down in 1904. To replace it, an oil mill was moved from Mensingeweer by millwright Van Ausselt. This mill was struck by lightning and burnt down in 1916. Van Ausselt and millwright Huberts, from Coevorden, moved a mill from Hankate, Overijssel, to replace it. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) This was the third move for that mill, which was originally built in 1732 as a barley mill at Leeuwarden, Friesland. By 1749 it was also an oil mill. It was moved between 1786 and 1805 to Heerenveen, Friesland, where it was known as Het Fortuin (English: The Fortune). In 1892 it was moved to Hankate, where the mill was known as the Molen van Kappert. The mill was worked until at least 1952, when it was sold to the Instituut voor de Landbouw. In 1973 it was transferred to De Hollandsche Molen and later still to Stichting Drentse Molens (English: Drenthe Mills Society). Description Nooitgedacht is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante stellingmolen\\". It is a two-storey smock mill with a stage on a three-storey brick base. The stage is at second-floor level, above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails have a span of and are carried in a cast-iron windshaft which was cast by Enthuizen in 1872. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 73 cogs. This drives the wallower (48 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 92 cogs, drives the diameter French Burr stones via a lantern pinion stone nut with 20 staves.

It is the only cemetery in Puerto Rico with a group of niches built forming a basement, in which the burials occurred beneath ground level, thus giving the effect of a catacomb.. The cemetery is named after Vincent de Paul (24 April 1581 ‚Äì 27 September 1660), the French Roman Catholic priest who dedicated his life to serving the poor.

The wealthy families of the area bought plots for $60 and began to develop the cemetery with magnificent graves and mausoleums. Today (February 2016), the cemetery is \\"squeezed\\" between sprawling urban residential developments that now fully surround it. Background and significance Ponce, located in the south coast of Puerto Rico, was one of the wealthiest settlements of the island at the turn of the 20th century. Given the status of area cemeteries at the time, the Catholic cemetery offered an exclusive precinct in which the rich could bury their dead. For this reason almost all the tombs are magnificent in their design, ornamentation, and construction. Some of the best examples of funerary architecture in Puerto Rico of the early 20th century period can be seen in this cemetery. Marble sculptures from Italy, Spain and other parts of Europe adorn many of the tombs. Most tombs are covered with Ponce's ubiquitous stylish pink marble as well. The larger mausolea, which belong to the wealthiest families of southern Puerto Rico, are magnificent examples of monumental funerary architecture of the period. Some of the best examples are the mausoleums of the Serralles, Mercado, Toro, and Valdivieso families. The cemetery is unique among others in Puerto Rico: \\"A unique feature of the cemetery is a group of niches that were built forming a basement, in which the burials occurred beneath ground level, thus giving the effect of a catacomb\\". Design The cemetery has a simple entrance gate. It consists of an iron gate flanked by two masonry pilasters. Although Catholic, this cemetery never had a chapel by the entrance, or anywhere in the entire precinct. The layout of the cemetery was done following the Spanish tradition of having two main axes forming a cross. The rest of the precinct's layout was done in a square grid fashion. The cemetery follows the contour lines of the steep site it is located on. As a results, some of the approach paths were built as stairs. The main axis culminates with the pantheon for the priests of the Paul order. \\"In this truly monumental tomb, sculptural forms are integral part of architecture. An interesting feature in this design with double function is the baldachino, which protects not only the altar, but also the tomb. The baroque style of this structure can be appreciated in the free use of forms, its large scale and sweeping vistas, and the complexity of its composition.\\" The cemetery has a clear arrangement of larger tombs placed along the major central and secondary axes. The other graves then radiate from there. Many of these larger tombs are mausoleums in different architectural styles ranging from the classical revival to the art-deco. Architecture Cementerio Catolico San Vicente de Paul in March 1988 The style of the cemetery is characterized more by its architectural than by its sculptural features.El Arte Funerario en los Cementerios de Ponce, Puerto Rico. By Jose Maria Alvarez Cervela. Atenea. Junio 1981. Page 59. The quality of the construction is such that \\"it is considered the posthumous mansion\\" of those buried there. A considerable number of the mausoleum in this cemetery are made of marble, a testimony to the wealth of those interred there. Of special significance for their architectural value are the Serralles family mausoleum composed of a central chaple raised over a raised plaza, the Mario Mercado Montalvo family mausoleum also over a raised plaza, and the Valdivieso family mausoleum. The Toro family mausoleum also presents a funerary chapel but it is not raised over a plaza nor is the Chardon family mausoleum. Recent developments Many of these magnificent tombs have been abandoned after their owners moved corpses of their dead to the Cementerio Civil de Ponce. This was due in part to the high cost of maintenance and the strict regulations set by the administration. Under no condition would they allow a non-Catholic to be buried there. Some families did not want to be separated by this rule and moved their loved ones to the Cementerio Civil. As a result, some graves have been abandoned and cannot be sold by the cemetery administration since they are private property and have a legal, albeit uninterested, owner.

Main characters Afro Samurai Child Afro Samurai (anime), Kari Wahlgren (video game) Teenager Afro Samurai Adult Afro Samurai Afro Samurai is the main protagonist of the series, who mourns for his father as a child and wears the Number Two headband on a quest to kill Justice and reclaim the Number One. As an adult, he often smoke hand- rolled cigarettes, drinks lemonade and has a deep calm voice. Ninja Ninja Ninja Ninja is Afro's partner, who mostly speaks in a normal voice while Afro refuses to reply conversations. Ninja Ninja wears a ninja motif and has white hair. As the series progresses, Ninja Ninja watches Afro seeking vengeance. At the beginning of Episode 5, it is revealed that Kuma apparently kills Ninja Ninja who saves Afro. About halfway through the episode, Afro confronts Justice who states that he watched him shed his \\"imaginary friend.\\" In the collector's DVD, interviews with the staff and writers concede that Ninja Ninja is indeed imaginary. However, even though Ninja Ninja is \\"imaginary,\\" he appears to have some form of presence in the real world, as well. When Brother 2 of the Empty Seven spies on Afro, Ninja Ninja can be clearly seen from Brother 2's point of view through the binoculars. Ninja Ninja also interacts with items around him constantly such as catching Afro's spliff in his mouth, moving a hanging pillar inside Otsuru's home, putting Otsuru's comb into Afro's hair, eating the food that was intended for Afro given by Brother 3 (as seen in the Director's cut) and throwing the Afro- Droid's microchip at Afro to cut in two. The idea of Ninja Ninja having at least a partial existence, in reality, is once again brought into light when he is 'killed' by Kuma. Because Kuma was such a skilled warrior and had the intent to cut down Afro on the sword strike that killed Ninja Ninja, it would seem odd that he would pause from his attack and have a conversation with Afro if there was not a reason to give pause which strengthens the idea that he was taken aback by Ninja Ninja's sacrifice before attacking Afro again. Additionally supporting his real-world presence is the scene in the video game in which he knocks the hand of one of the Empty Seven off of a ledge, killing him, as is the scene after Sword Master's death in which one of the many clones of Ninja Ninja grabs Sword Master's mouth and moves it up in down, pretending he is a puppet. In Afro Samurai: Resurrection, Ninja Ninja is confirmed to be emanated from the Number Two Headband in conjunction with the wearer's mind, restored to Afro with the band itself. In the video game, Afro battles Ninja Ninja in his mind in order to regain his humanity which he lost as a result of being the Number Two. Jinnosuke/\\"Kuma\\" Jinnosuke is a swordsman wearing a cybernetic teddy bear helmet (the same design as Otsuru's teddy bear from their time as children in their dojo) earning him the nickname \\"Kuma,\\" (Bear in Japanese). He wears black keikogi, hakama and toe strapping metal geta sandals and wields twin katanas. He also considers Afro Samurai to be his best friend and brother. In the series, he blames Afro for killing their master and even taking the Number Two headband. Jinno mourns for the others from the dojo, suffers his wounds at the Midnight Battle Under the Bodhi Tree and falls from the cliff. He is rescued by Dharman who creates his robotic body. Afro seemingly destroys his life-support system to defeat Jinno, but he recovers his body, straps it with the rest of all ranked headbands as bandages and sees to fight with Afro who wears the Number 1 headband. In Afro Samurai: Resurrection, he works with his younger sister Sio, who lived with her foster parents as a child. Jinno shortly had muted his voice and cannot conversed with Sio, until Rokutaro seemingly kills Afro. Jinno and Sio are impaled and killed by Rokutaro, before Jinno's electricity from his robotic body travels through Sio's blood and resurrects Afro. In the video game, Jinno's transformation into Kuma is not explained and does not recognize Afro after confrontation. He recovers his memory of the schoolyard massacre as the two battle each other and then appears to die at the conclusion. Antagonists The Empty Seven Brother 1 Brother 2 Brother 3 (Afro Samurai), Jeff Bennett (Afro Samurai: Resurrection) Brother 4 Brother 5 Brother 6 The is a group of six monks who believe that attaining both ancient headbands will lead to immortality and godhood. They employ robots and mercenaries to do their dirty work, since the monks themselves have greatly inferior fighting skills when compared to Afro and Justice possibly due to their age difference. Brothers 1 through 5 look like identical wizened old men with long beards, dressed in robes with some other accessories: * Brother 1 was the apparent leader of the Clan (although such an authority was never outright stated). His personality and mannerisms were a mixture of an Evangelical preacher and a street pimp. He was almost always seen with an almost nude beautiful woman at his side. As with most of the Clan, he was a wizened old man with a long beard and has a prosthetic gold left arm (which can be switched out for a machine gun). In an attempt to ambush Afro from atop the elevator leading to Kuma following the Afro Droid's destruction, Brother 1 ended up being paralyzed and held in a stretcher with a catheter by Brother 3 making him the only monk to fight Afro directly and lose but survive. Brother One's woman is seen in Afro Samurai: Resurrection working as a stripper in Brother 3's gambling house at which she excels perfectly. * Brother 2 was the eyes of the Clan often seen scoping out Afro from a distance with a pair of high-tech binoculars. Usually Brother 6 was shown assisting him. All of his observations of Afro during his reconnaissance were reported to Brother 1 via cell phone. In combat, he was shown to use an extending Buddhist staff or kunai. When Otsuru turns against the Empty Seven for Afro's sake, it was Brother 2 who stabbed and killed her. Later when he was lying in wait to kill Afro, Afro surprises him from behind by swiftly poking his eyes and shoving his binoculars deep into the wounds. Likely the brutal manner of his execution was out of revenge for Otsuru. * Brother 3 was unusual among the clan because he was the most laid-back of the brothers. While the other Brothers would plot Afro's death, Brother 3 was usually content to face away off in the corner, listening to his circumaural headphones and bobbing to the music. During the few times that he actually spoke, he was shown to have a Southern US accent. He seemed to have a much more pacifistic approach than his comrades regarding decisions. When deliberating on which assassin to choose to kill Afro, rather than settle things through violence Brother 3 suggested looking at their individual credentials. Later when Afro invaded the Empty Seven's temple, he was waiting by the door with tea and rice crackers prepared while calmly chanting Hachimaki o kudasai, (Japanese for \\"headband please.\\") simply asking for the Number Two Headband, rather than attempting combat for it. Afro didn't take the rice and tea offered to him, but Ninja Ninja did. Because of this, Brother 3 survived while the other monks were killed and injured. In Afro Samurai: Resurrection, Brother 3 uses the dice remote controller to change numbers, but Afro disqualifies him cheating the game. * Brother 4 was a gruff deep-voiced monk in a green robe who usually carried a Buddhist staff and wore a metal kasa. He was usually seen side-by-side with Brother 5. In combat, Brother 4's weapon of choice was a sansetsukon. When determining which assassin would face Afro, Brother 4 insisted that Ivanov the Russian was the obvious choice which led to an argument with Brother 5 who held opposing views and felt Foo from China was more capable. Brother 1 settled the issue by suggesting a battle royale, an idea which greatly appealed to both 4 & 5\\\\. Later after Brother 6's defeat at Afro's hands, Brothers 4 & 5 launched out from where they were concealed in Brother 6's backpack and attempted to gang up on Afro from both sides. This tactic failed miserably and both monks were easily killed. * Brother 5 was the arrogant and sadistic monk who wore a plain white robe, regularly smoked a long pipe, and spoke with a high squeaky voice. In combat, Brother 4's weapon of choice was a jian (in the manga, he wields a tant≈ç). When determining which assassin would face Afro, Brother 4 insisted that Ivanov the Russian was the obvious choice which led to an argument with Brother 5 who held opposing views and felt Foo from China was more capable. Brother 1 settled the issue by suggesting a battle royale, an idea which greatly appealed to both 4 & 5\\\\. Later after Brother 6's defeat at Afro's hands, Brothers 4 & 5 launched out from where they were concealed in Brother 6's backpack and attempted to gang up on Afro from both sides. This tactic failed miserably and both monks were easily killed. In the manga, Afro Samurai kicks Brother 5 over the waterfall and is later found dead in the water face down. * Brother 6 was a large, muscled individual with cold inhuman eyes in monk regalia who wore a metal kasa. He was the only Brother who didn't resemble an old monk with a long beard. As mentioned in the manga, his true name is Rokutaro and he is the youngest of the Empty 7. Violent and impulsive, Brother 6 never hesitated to use excessive force in his actions. In combat, he wielded a long Buddhist staff and a backpack holding a variety of weapons, including a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and a flame thrower. Brother 6 was the man who rescued Jinnosuke and Otsuru from the brink of death, but regarding Jinnosuke felt it would have been more merciful to just let him die. He was the one to burn down Otsuru's home and blew up the bridge after Afro's initial confrontation with Afro Droid (much to Brother 1's displeasure). When that tactic failed, Brother 6 fought Afro one-on-one. He proved a difficult opponent and when defeated held Afro's sword within his body, disarming the samurai so that Brothers 4 & 5 could have the advantage over Afro. In the video game, Brother 7 is said be God himself and that one becomes a God by sacrificing the other six Brothers where they each fell into the rotating blades. Brother 2 does this while attempting to use Afro to take his place. However, Afro Samurai defeats the rest of the brothers, after his fight with Jinno while Brother 3 throws his own blood into the rotating blades before leaving the rest to the Empty Seven's robots. Otsuru/\\"Okiku\\" Okiku Otsuru Otsuro is a young woman who specializes in the art of healing, cooking and adores fireworks. As a child, she meets Afro in the shrine after he lost the Number Two headband, and took him to the Sword Master's dojo. That night, Otsuru finds herself to witness that the rest of the assassins and the Sword Master's pupils are killed. Otsuru survives and joins up with the Empty Seven Clan as an agent working for Brother 1. Years later, Otsuru saves Afro, who survives Soshun's poisonous crossbow infection and Brother 6's RPG explosion on the cliff. Though Otsuru changes her name to \\"Okiku\\", she spends time with Afro at the bamboo forest. She uses her unique ability to siphon memories from anyone's dream and copies Afro's sword style for the Afro Droid. She attempts to kill Afro, but she realizes her mistake. Brother 2 then kills Otsuru for helping Afro and betraying the Empty Seven. In the video game adaptation, Okiku is the assassin who works for the Empty Seven Clan. Brother 2 and Brother 6 later kill her for helping Afro avoid getting captured and after falling in love with him. Dharman Dharman is an insane cyborg scientist employed by the Empty Seven Clan to build their machine-ninja army and the Afro-Droid. He repairs Jinnosuke's body with his protective \\"Teddy Bear\\" helmet. His name comes from the fact that he closely resembles a Japanese Dharma doll. When Afro defeats Jinnosuke, it is likely that Dharman was the one who repaired and rebuilt him. He was assumed by many fans to be Brother #7, as indicated when Brother #1 refers to him as \\"brother,\\" but the official site states that this is in fact not the case. He also does not like to think of himself as part of the group, referring to them in the third person in the second-to-last chapter. In Afro Samurai: Resurrection, Dharman works for Sio in her vicious plan to get revenge on Afro. Using advanced bio-technology, he is able to create a clone of Afro's father from a jawbone that Sio stole from the warrior's grave. He rebuilds Sio's foster family members Bin, Michael and Tomoe into cybernetic warriors. Dharman is aroused by Sio's seductive beauty and sadistic nature as she toys with him although he scolds her for interrupting Rokutaro's resurrection process. Before resurrecting Rokutaro, Sio stabs to kill Dharman for insisting her henchmen into fighting with Afro. Afro-Droid The Afro-Droid is a semi-sentient robot copy of Afro Samurai created by the Empty Seven Clan. Otsuru created it from combat data siphoned from Afro's mind, and reproduces all of his learned techniques and abilities. While Afro Samurai and Afro-Droid are identical, Afro-Droid is equipped with guns, lasers and explosives. In the third episode after fighting through from the air to the ground, Afro destroys the robot and the memory chip. Justice The villainous gunslinger who kills Rokutaro and takes the Number One headband. At the end of the miniseries, he stays at the throne room to live at Mount Shumi where Afro cut his pair of arms along with the third one behind holding a sword for execution. After Justice regenerates himself and declare that all ranked headbands on corpses would remain there, Afro slices his body to smaller pieces. During interviews for the DVD, it is stated that Justice and Rokutaro were in fact part of the swordsmen and friends. However, their differing views on the headbands and how to end the violence plaguing the world eventually drove them apart, leading to the final confrontation between them. In the manga and video game, Afro discovers that Justice is long-dead at the lair. Afro forcingly confronts his guilt for revenge. Afro resists the sins to break free from his past and kill Justice. He also appears in Afro Samurai: Resurrection without speaking, one being crucified in Afro's dream with Rokutaro and the other meets Takimoto in the afterlife. Lady Sio Adult Sio Young Sio Lady Sio is Jinno's younger sister appearing in Afro Samurai Resurrection. She asks Jinno to kill Afro, but Jinno refuses, calling Afro \\"his brother\\" of the sword and had a stronger bond. Unlike Otsuru, Sio and her brother are orphans while Afro and Jinno went to train with the Sword Master, Sio apparently lives with her wealthy and powerful foster family who had their own castle and their replaced daughter who treats Sio as the princess. Sio dislikes and learns that when Afro was young, he killed them though the words of her servant, Tomoe, imply that their lands were destroyed in the chaos that after Afro takes the Number One headband, which means that her family's death is not Afro's fault. Rokutaro impales Sio and Jinno's damaged body with the broken sword. Bin Bin is Sio's protector. When Sio was young, he was part of her foster family and always made people laugh because of the funny mask he wore. But after the town where he lived was destroyed (Sio blames Afro for this event), he was almost killed and was reconstructed by the mad professor Dharman as a cybernetic fighter (similar to Jinno's situation). Now no longer laughing, but a hateful shell of the man he once was, he wears the same humorous Hyottoko mask that he had in the past to conceal his robotic appearance. Bin usually carries a boom box that can fire metal spikes and is capable of turning his left hand into a blade and his right hand into a laser cannon as well as using his robotic feet to make huge leaps. He and the other henchmen despise Afro because they consider him responsible for their loss of humanity and desire to kill him in order to prevent Sio from becoming a murderer. After the other two henchmen are destroyed, he grabs Afro's leg with his last strength and wants to detonate himself in order to kill him but Afro disposes of him by kicking his head off. Michael Similar to Bin, Michael was part of Sio's foster family and used to entertain people by dressing in a dragon costume. He was also reconstructed by the scientist Dharman as a cyborg after he had suffered nearly fatal injuries. He wears a cloak and a red dragon mask which fires flames and rockets when it opens its mouth. After Afro dispatches the mask and the cloak covering his body, it is revealed that the only organic parts that are left from him are his head and torso, the rest of his body being cybernetic and having attached a pair of long, metallic chains and a huge machine gun on it. After his fellow henchman, Tomoe, grabs Afro and begs him to shoot them with his machine gun, he at first refuses to do it, fearing that he might kill her, but at Bin's request he decides to fire at them. Afro instead uses Tomoe as a human shield, and therefore she is completely destroyed by Michael's bullets. He is killed by Afro, who first destroys his metallic legs then cuts him in half with his blade. NOTE: Michael does not have a voice actor as he cannot speak, being able to communicate only through his glasses that serve as a digital display for words and images. Tomoe Part of her foster family, Tomoe was a woman who was seen holding a shamisen (guitar-like Japanese instrument) and was very kind to Sio (teaching her to dance among other things). Like the other two henchmen, she became a cyborg assassin after the tragic event that occurred in her town. She wears a wide hat and holds the same instrument that she used to sing at in the past, now being capable of turning it into a deadly weapon. Also, she wears a Noh Mask that resembles her old appearance in order to hide her burnt face. Her jet-propelled cybernetic feet allow her to fly, and her enhanced muscular tissue adds more power to her strikes, thus making her a worthy opponent. She is able to injure Afro with her weapon, and after she grabs him with her enhanced arm, she is willing to sacrifice herself by telling Michael to shoot them with his machinegun. But Afro manages to poke her eyes out and use her as a shield in the way of Michael's bullets. After being torn apart by the bullets, her damaged cybernetic body explodes, thus ending her life. Other characters Rokutaro Afro's father and owner of the Number One headband who is decapitated by Justice, who mentions to Afro about the assassins fighting each other to the death for the headbands. Justice wears the Number One headband to become god, while Afro wears the Number Two for revenge. In Afro Samurai Resurrection, Sio and Jinno take Rokutaro's jawbone and help Dharman use it to resurrect Rokutaro. Sio kills Dharman for the loss of her henchmen leaving the mental recreation incomplete and makes him angry. After choking and seemingly killing Afro, Rokutaro impales Jinno and Sio with Afro's broken sword. Jinno's robotic body then uses electricity on Sio's blood near Afro to resurrect him. Afro defeats the cloned Rokutaro and takes both headbands. Sword Master The Sword Master is a one-eyed samurai adopting to train orphans as graduated warriors. He informs Afro Samurai that wearing special rank headbands would lead to murderous survival. At the cliff near the Bodhi Tree, the Sword Master wearing the Number Two headband, insists Afro to kill him. After the rest of all assassins and students were killed, Afro executes the Sword Master dead and takes the headband. In the video game, the Sword Master and his older brother found and adopted Afro, who later kills the daimy≈ç, suspecting him to be the Number Two. As he dies, the daimy≈ç reveals the true identity of the Number Two. The incident triggers the schoolyard massacre carried out by the daimy≈çs men as an act of revenge. The official site reveals that the Sword Master was Rokutaro's friend which helps explain the basis for his advice and world view. Shichigoro Shichigoro is the owner of the Number Two headband and Kotaro's stepfather. Like the Sword Master, Shichigoro hides it and meets Afro, who saves Kotaro from the assassin. On the night for the Japanese rap parade festival, Shichigoro battles Afro before killing Sio's ninjas for stopping the party. Shichigoro inadvertently kills the DJ and Afro impales them dead. In the manga, he and the Oden Shop Master used to work for the Empty Seven. Shichigoro betrayed the Empty Seven after the Oden Shop Master botched an assignment and had to protect him from the Empty Seven's Cleaners. Kotaro Kotaro is Shichigoro's adopted son, who sadly vows revenge after Afro kills Shichigoro. In the manga, Kotaro is killed by Afro. In the anime film, Afro hands the Number 2 headband to Kotaro and tells him to fight when they are ready. Takimoto Takimoto is a mysterious person who greets Justice in Afro Samurai: Resurrection. In the manga, he holds a similar duty to Justice that the Empty Seven and Kuma held in the anime, protecting the \\"Number One\\" and defeating the current \\"Number Two.\\" Although he explains himself as having the goal of observing the order of the world, seeing Afro about to reach the throne room made him ready to interfere. He even interacted with Ninja Ninja. Depending on the possible third film, it is unknown if his motives and goals will be carried to the anime, since many of the characters have similar but slightly altered parts in the manga. Minor characters * DJ (voiced by RZA) - A disc jockey rapper who is inadvertently killed by Shichigoro during his duel with Afro Samurai at the parade festival. * Daigo \\"Big Boy\\" - Exclusive to the manga, Daigo \\"Big Boy\\" is one of the students of the Sword Master.

He is considered to be one of the world's most capable assassins, and describes himself as \\"first among men and machines\\". Brother 5 believes that Fu could have defeated Afro, but Brother 4 disagrees about this stating that Ivanoff would have been more suitable.

His name may be a reference to Kasumi Fu from Samurai Champloo which has been stated as a leading inspiration behind Afro Samurai. * Gorokube - Exclusive to the manga, Gorokube is a warlord who is contracted by the Empty Seven to target Afro Samurai. Wielding an RPG and a mini-gun, Gorokube attacks Afro Samurai during a parade. His arsenal does give Afro Samurai some trouble until Afro Samurai manages to kill Gorokube and his minions. * Hachiro (voiced by Jeff Bennett) - In Afro's flashback, he and his brothers were the ones who attacked young Afro some time after Justice killed Rokutaro. After young Afro attacked his brother Yashichi, Hachiro later attacked him. With some help from Jinno, Afro managed to kill Hachiro. * Ivanov (voiced by John DiMaggio) - A Russian assassin hired by the Empty Seven. He is considered one of the world's best assassins, and describes himself as \\"second to no man\\". Brother 4 believes that Ivanov could have defeated Afro, but Brother 5 disagrees about this. He is killed along with every other assassin that charged towards the Afro Droid (his appearance was in the Director's Cut DVD). * Jiro (voiced by Tara Strong) - He is one of the students of the Sword Master. Jiro is killed in the Midnight Battle Under the Bodhi Tree. * Juzo (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) - * Kazuma - Exclusive to the manga, Kazuma is one of the students of the Sword Master and is the talkative of the bunch. His fate was unknown since he wasn't seen during the Midnight Battle Under the Bodhi Tree. * Matasaburo (voiced by Dave Wittenberg) - One of the students of the Sword Master who is killed by assassins at the Midnight Battle Under the Bodhai Tree. * Sasuke (voiced by Jason Marsden) is a teenage student of Sword Master and a friend to both Afro and Jinno. He wears a pair of glasses which are held to the face by string (similar to those worn in feudal Japan and late dynastic China). Though he graduated from swordsman school at the same time as Afro and Jinno, his skills are apparently inferior to theirs (though he is seen killing two people in his final battle). He appears to be very eccentric as shown by his playful manner with his friends as well as telling his friends that he hopes to eat chicken cutlet for his final meal, much to their disbelief. During a flashback in the fourth episode, he is impaled and being killed behind by one of the assassins in the Midnight Battle Under The Bodhi Tree. * O-Sachi - Exclusive to the manga, O-Sachi is a young woman who found Afro Samurai following his slaying of the Empty Seven and his fight with Kuma. She belongs to an isolated community that follows the teachings of \\"The One.\\" As she cares for Afro Samurai, she seems to develop an attraction to him and it appears that Afro Samurai might reciprocate. Unfortunately, it turns out that \\"The One\\" would probably be more accurately referred to as \\"Number One\\". When she learns that Afro cannot forgive Justice and intends to kill him despite all the good he's done, she attempts to kill Afro first since Afro Samurai had previously killed her sister. This leads to Afro slaughtering the entire community. * Oden Shop Master (voiced by Mark Hamill) - The Oden Shop Master is the unnamed owner of an oden shop, Shichigoro friend and Kotaro's caretaker. In the manga, he and Shichigoro used to work for the Empty Seven. Shichigoro protected the owner from the Empty Seven's cleaners after he botched up assignments. * Soshun (voiced by John Kassir) - A man who comes from the Land of the Weapon Masters of the West. He wielded a giant crossbow with a grenade launcher. He first saw Afro in a bar and learned the history of the headbands from its bartender. He encountered Afro on the mountain when Ninja Ninja detected him. In his battle against Afro, Soshun was killed by Afro. Though one of his poisoned arrows had grazed Afro and resulting in his temporary handicap against his first encounter with Brother 6. * Thugs (voiced by Dwight Schultz and Dave Wittenberg) - Seemingly endless hordes of men in various costumes seek the Number Two headband throughout the series. When fighting any of the major characters they inevitably chuckle menacingly before dying in huge numbers and in various states of dismemberment. * Yashichi (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) - He is the brother of Hachiro and was with him in their first attack upon young Afro. Some time later, young Afro managed to interrogate him for the info on who has the Number Two Headband before killing him. Video game characters The following were exclusive to the Afro Samurai video game: * Ashura Brothers - The Ashura Brothers are Afro Samurai's first opponents in the Lowdown East Pass level where Brother 2 and Brother 6 sent to attack him, but Afro kills them. * Daimyo (voiced by W. Morgan Sheppard) - In the video game, the Daimyo is the oldest brother of the Sword Master. The Daimyo presides over the province where the Sword Master's dojo is located. He and his brother do not share the same wisdom and had also known Rokutaro. The Daimyo and the Sword Master found a young Afro Samurai in a beaten up state and carrying the skull of Rokutaro in his backpack. A teenage Afro Samurai later raided his palace in search of the identity of the Number Two. The Daimyo claims that there are no sacred headbands. Before he dies following a fight with Afro Samurai, the Daimyo states that the Sword Master is the Number Two. The Daimyo's remaining men later attack the Sword Master's school in retaliation for the Daimyo's death. * Hanjiro (voiced by John Kassir) - * Keisuke - A warrior whom Afro killed. * Masaki - A warrior whom Afro killed. * Osachi (voiced by Kelly Hu) - * Polecats (voiced by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn) - A group of dancers and assassins that work for the Daimyo and served as line of defenses when teenage Afro Samurai raided his palace. * Takamori - A warrior who follows Okiku and attacks Afro Samurai and attempts to take the Number 2 headband, but he is killed. * The Wild Five - The Wild Five are a group of five armored samurai in the mountains where Afro Samurai defeats them.

In 1842, due to economic losses, Lupton had to sell the fort and it was bought by the successful fur trading firm Pratte and Cabann√© who managed it from 1843 to 1845.

History Defiance County was established in 1845 but had its roots in Williams County. The latter county was established in 1824 with the county seat at Defiance. As Williams County lost land to other counties, Defiance was no longer central for the remaining population. The county seat changed to Bryan and would have doomed Defiance if not for a proposal for a new county. The time was right for Defiance as the population surrounding it grew to the numbers needed to form a new county. On March 4, 1845, a bill was passed to form Defiance County with the county seat in Defiance. A celebration was held on March 13 with speeches, bonfires, and banquets. The first courts were held in a brick schoolhouse located on Wayne Street, but the first courthouse was started in October 1845. This Federal style building was designed and built by John Bostata on the site of the present courthouse. The brick structure rose two stories tall with a portico framed by four columns supporting a pediment. The rectangular building was lined with rectangular windows and pilasters with an entablature topping the facade. The roof was topped by a square drum supporting a domed cupola capped by a spire. This courthouse served the county until 1870 as the population continued to grow. Soon the courthouse was deemed to be too small and a new courthouse was needed. The county selected the plans of architect J.C. Johnson designed in the Italianate and Second Empire styles. The courthouse was designed with a mansard roof but was decided against for safety reasons. In 2006 the county was faced with a growing population and needed more room for the county offices. The county issued a vote to determine if the current courthouse should be razed or if a new building or addition should be built. The vote came back in favor of the building leading the county to investigate alternatives.http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?&Dato;=20070708&Kategori;=NEWS17&Lopenr;=707080342&Ref;=AR Exterior The three-story building has a projecting center and ends. The facade is lined with decorative stone elements along the window and door trims and pilasters. The stone foundation is windowless and contains a water table. The first floor contains long rectangular windows with triangular pediments crowning each window. The entrance is located in a small arched portico with Doric columns. The second floor once contained arched windows but the arched portion is now bricked over and contains long rectangular windows. The third floor once matched the decorative bottom floors but was removed and replaced by a modern design containing rectangular windows and a clock face. The third floor was once topped by a balustrade, and the central projection rose into a clock tower 125 feet above the ground. A war memorial was designed by Mark Homier and is situated in front of the courthouse and lists the names of Defiance County soldiers from World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Global War on Terror. The memorial depicts a grieving soldier and a nurse in the center of two gently sloping wings. The memorial also contains an eternal flame in honor of those who gave all for their country.

The hull is welded steel, and the vehicle is amphibious. The first prototype was built in 1972.  Description  The 6614 hull is made of welded steel with a uniform thickness of 8 mm; the driver's seat is on the front of the vehicle on the left and is equipped with episcopes that allow observation of the vehicle in front and to the sides. The engine with the transmission is located in the front right side of the vehicle in order to leave as much space as possible to the team of soldiers transported in the rear, equipped with a hatch for the rapid disembarkation / embarkation of men. The Blindo could be armed with a simple turret (which can be folded down to facilitate strategic transport) manually operated (the same as the VCC-1 Camillino) equipped with a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun. There is also has a hatch in the middle of the vehicle and there are side slits and rear equipped with fume extractor from the fighting compartment, that allow the safe use of personal armament by the transported personnel. On each side of the turret there is finally an installation for three electrically operated fog-type grenade launchers. A particular feature that distinguishes this medium is its ability to act as an amphibious medium. The thrust in the water is provided by the movement created by the wheels, while the buoyancy is allowed thanks to the shape of the vehicle and the joints to make it waterproof. Because of its ability to be amphibious, the Fiat 6614 can be very useful in rescue missions and emergencies such as natural disasters, and for this reason it is still in service in the mobile police of the State Police. Variants Type 6616 The Type 6616 was a version of the Type 6614 that incorporated a turret armed with a 20mm autocannon. The turret was designed, built, and installed by Oto Melara. KM900 The KM900 was a version of the Fiat 6614 produced under license by Asia Motors for use by the Republic of Korea Army. It is expected that the KM900s will be phased out with the introduction of the KNAV (KW1 Scorpion).

On March 16, 1764, Francisco Javier de la Torre arrived at Marinduque riding on a Spanish frigate Santa Rosa. In March 1764, acting governor Anda formally handed over his command to de la Torra making the latter as the new governor-general.

In this judicial investigation it was found out that the finances of the colony was faithfully and honestly administered by Anda during the war years. De la Torre was able to begin the work of reconstruction in the war-devastated colony immediately.

It was closed in 1992. Origin of the discoth√®que In the 1950s, dance halls were common throughout the world. People danced to the music of a band that usually played cover songs. On Monday 19 October 1959, the former restaurant The Scotch Club in Aachen, North Rhine Westphalia, re-opened as a dancehall, but the owner did not want to hire a band and used a record player instead. Klaus Quirini, a volunteer newspaper journalist reporting on the event, was as bored as most of the visitors and took over the record player. He used the style common with many radio news reporters, announcing songs and audience games and giving comments. The first song he played was the chart hit Ein Schiff wird kommen by Lale Andersen. His style was immediately popular, and he from then on remained the disc-jockey, one of the earliest credited DJs. As DJ Heinrich, he organised other DJs to found a workers' union that made DJ an official (i.e. healthcare registered) profession. Later development Udo J√ºrgens, Peter Maffay, the Rattles and Giorgio Moroder began their careers in the Scotch Club. The dress code was strict and bouncers refused entrance to men not wearing a tie, even celebrities such as television presenter Frank Elstner and singer Udo Lindenberg. The club closed in 1992. Opposite its address in Dahmengraben 7, another old disco, Le Bistro, is still in use. Since the opening of the Scotch-Club in late 1959, other discoth√®ques opened throughout Aachen and in other major towns. When the first club opened in the US, there were already 17 discos in Aachen.

Plot summary CIA field agent Mitch Rapp's cover has been blown following his last assignment, preventing Saddam Hussein from obtaining nuclear weapons. Rapp receives public acknowledgment by the president in response to the latest Congressional leak to the media. Though the praise is of the highest quality, the President might as well have placed a bulls-eye on Rapp's chest and that of his loved ones by singling him out as the most important person in the fight against terrorism. The spotlight makes the former covert operator an ideal international target for eradication by terrorists as the symbol he has become. Rapp moves from CIA operative duties to that of a counter-terrorism bureaucrat. As special advisor on counter-terrorism to CIA director Dr. Irene Kennedy, Rapp uncomfortably sits in an office. However, everything changes when radical Islamic terrorists ambush Navy SEALs on a top-secret rescue mission in the Philippines. The leak had to be in either the State Department or the Philippine diplomatic corps, but nobody knows for sure. However, worse yet is that someone is trying to cause a Jihad on a scale never before seen and that unknown invisible individual is close to achieving the goal with only a too visible Rapp in the way. Rapp leads a team to avenge that loss by defeating the Philippine terrorist network that killed two SEAL team members and rescuing the American hostages. In order to successfully accomplish this mission he must keep its existence from the turncoats who betrayed those who went before him. The coincidental plot-line has forces plotting to upset the tenuous balance in the Middle East's geopolitical situation. A flamboyant Saudi Prince, who is banished from the Kingdom, elicits the help of a Palestinian assassin to murder the leaders of terrorist cells as well as Saudi and Palestinian Ambassadors in the hopes of dissolving US support for Israel and the eventual establishment of an official Palestinian state.

Beef One downside of boneless beef is that the meat, while cooking, does not have an opportunity to absorb flavor and minerals from the bone. Chicken Boneless chicken typically does not have a skin, as this is removed during the process of removing the bones. For this reason, it is sometimes considered healthier. A downside is that the skin may help prevent the chicken from drying during cooking, so that it can have more moisture and flavor. Boneless chicken breast An upside of boneless and skinless chicken breast is that it is versatile and easy to handle. Boneless chicken wings Boneless chicken wings are not actually wings, but rather are typically formed from breast meat, which is faster to cook but not as succulent as real wings, which have skin, bone, and cartilage.

Allardt Map of the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad ‚Äì note dual connections to Baylands Marsh as well as to San Francisquito Creek. Crosby's Creek now known as Matadero Creek, appeared to end in or near the tidal marsh. Barron Creek was tributary to Adobe Creek. History The Ohlone people were the original inhabitants of Adobe Creek. A large shell mound which once had a group of Indian huts was found near Adobe Creek in Palo Alto. Evidence of a smaller settlement within Los Altos was uncovered in 1971, when an Ohlone burial ground with skeletons‚Äîone with ceremonial beads‚Äîwas uncovered by new construction along Adobe Creek near O'Keefe Lane. The site had other artifacts, and an archeological dig was mounted by Foothill College. Around this same time, an Ohlone basket was discovered buried in the Creek bank further north. The O'Keefe site has a historical plaque marking the historic site. On the 1862 Allardt Map the upper creek is called Arroyo San Antonio (San Antonio Creek) and the lower creek is called Arroyo de las Yeguas (Yeguas Creek). Yeguas is Spanish for \\"mare\\", and the Mission Santa Clara named it that because they built a corral for mares along the creek's banks near the Bay. Juan Prado Mesa renamed it San Antonio Creek when he was granted Rancho San Antonio in 1839 by Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. The Adobe Creek name appears as early as 1855 on an official surveyor's map, which lists both the Adobe and San Antonio names for the creek. During the secularization of the missions in the 1830s, Alvarado parceled out much of their land to prominent Californios via land grants. Mesa was a soldier stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco who had become alfarez (officer in command) in 1837. He built a large square adobe, which lasted well into the twentieth century as a crumbling ruin long thought of as a fortification. The site today is on a hill on the southeast side of El Monte Avenue near Summerhill Avenue in Los Altos, California, most of which is located on the territory of the Rancho. The upper creek originates in the historic Rancho La Purisima Concepcion, which was granted by Governor Alvarado in 1840 to Jose Gorgonio, an Indian living at Mission Santa Clara. Gorgonio moved to the west bank of Adobe Creek near Fremont Avenue in Los Altos Hills. Much of the town of Los Altos Hills, California was located on this Rancho. In 1844 Rancho La Purisima Concepcion was sold to Juana Briones de Miranda, whose family members had accompanied both the Gaspar de Portol√† and the Juan Bautista de Anza Expeditions. Her uniquely constructed wood-framed, rammed-earth and adobe brick house, believed to have been built by American sailors who had deserted, is located at 4155 Old Adobe Road on the border between Palo Alto and Los Altos Hills, and is marked by a historical marker at the corner of Old Adobe Road and Old Trace Lane. Designated a California State Historical Landmark in 1954, the 160-year- old Juana Briones home was scheduled for demolition in 2007 because of damage to it by the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. In 2009, it still stands and has been recently documented with a Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). After 1831, Mexican rancho owners would logically erect their dwellings on or very near creeks. Locally, Juan Prado's adobe was near Adobe Creek & Juanita Briones' adobe was near Barron Creek. Because they were permanent features of the landscape, creeks were often used as Rancho boundaries. This was true locally, where the Mexican dise√±o show Adobe Creek as the boundary between Rancho San Antonio and Rancho La Purisima Concepcion. When Americans took over in 1850, speculators bought much of this land. Much of it initially became large self-contained ranches‚Äîtypically running cattle & growing crops like wheat, barley & oats that required little or no irrigation. That changed in a few decades when it was discovered that orchards and vineyards could thrive here. Such agriculture of course used more water. Local land was cut progressively into smaller holdings, until most of it was subdivided as the population increased. This meant more and more wells, including large ones dug along Adobe Creek by early water companies to serve the little town of Los Altos. The water table inevitably shrank as a result, and alarms about this development appeared, at least as early as the 1920s. In the early 1930s, the Los Altos News reported that the water table, which stood at 120 feet in 1898, was now down to 335 feet. The Trust for Hidden Villa, is a nonprofit educational organization founded by Frank and Josephine Duveneck, who purchased most of the land comprising the upper Adobe Creek watershed in 1924. They opened Hidden Villa as a gathering place for discussion, reflection, and incubation of social reform. Over the following decades, the Duvenecks also established the first Hostel on the Pacific Coast (1937), the first multiracial summer camp (1945), and Hidden Villa's Environmental Education Program (1970), all on the creek's upper reaches. Adobe Creek Lodge, an English country-style mansion, was built by Consolidated Chemicals vice- president Milton Haas in 1935. It was a destination resort in the 1940s. Bandleaders Jimmy Dorsey and Harry James played there. The founders of Adobe Systems, a software company, lived next to Adobe Creek in Los Altos, and named their company after the creek. The founder of Los Altos, Paul Shoup picked a premium lot on Adobe Creek for his home from the ranch lands he helped purchase from Sarah Winchester that later became the community of Los Altos. The Paul Shoup House on Adobe Creek is the first property in Los Altos to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Marino, Pam.

Watershed and course White alder (Alnus rhombifolia) in Redwood Grove. Alder is California's most valuable hardwood, often used for furniture, flooring, or cabinetry. Douglas fir forest returns to the summit, it may add significant precipitation to the watershed via fog drip. Loss of streamside (riparian) vegetation increases stream velocity, causing downstream erosion and channel incision (dark gully behind tree) at Hidden Villa 2010 Robleda Creek, a minor tributary, at Orchard Hill Lane, Los Altos Hills Adobe Creek drains about , arising at on the northeastern flank of Black Mountain in Los Altos Hills, California. Adobe Creek was once a perennial stream, as evidenced by historical presence of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trout young spend their first year in fresh water and obviously cannot survive in streams that run dry seasonally. Historically, lawsuits were filed to prevent diversion of creek water for irrigation because they caused the creek to run \\"dry certain seasons of the year\\". A 1919 lawsuit against upstream creek diversion for \\"alfalfa fields\\" and \\"hog wallows\\" reads: \\"From time immemorial...the waters of Adobe Creek have flowed into, over upon and through the lands...from Hidden Villa high in the hills, past the wonderful home gardens of Los Altos to the Santa Clara Valley and on to the sea...Charles K. Field mourns the loss of the song of the brook that made his garden with its rockery an enchanted spot; Shoup's children can no longer wade in the stream, because there is no stream to wade in; acres and acres of McCutchen's rhododendrons are now languishing and dying with unsatisfied thirst.\\" This written record confirms oral histories taken by local historian Don McDonald that Adobe Creek used to flow year-round. It is also consistent with Eleanor Cranston Fowle Cameron's (the sister of Senator Alan Cranston was born in 1909 and they lived on Cypress Court, north of West Edith Avenue in Los Altos Hills) account that in her youth the creek was perennial and that her \\"father fished the steelhead that ran up from the Bay to the pool below the waterfall\\". On March 1, 1973 the State Water Resources Board (SWRB is now the California Department of Water Resources) granted water rights to the Purissima Hills Water District to withdraw 2.0 cubic feet per second (cfs) from the perennial reach where the SWRB had documented flows of 3.0 cfs on August 12, 1970, despite protestations by Robert and Mary Stutz who had rights to withdraw 0.005 cfs at Elena and Moody Roads, and Roy and Penny Lave who had rights to withdraw 0.008 cfs near Manresa Way and University Avenue. Today the creek's perennial sections are above Hidden Villa and between Foothill Expressway and Interstate 280 above the Manresa Way bridge. Adobe Creek's upper tributaries are, in order, the Middle Fork Adobe Creek, then immediately the West Fork Adobe Creek (the West Fork is known locally as Letcher Creek). Next the North Fork Adobe Creek (originating on Page Mill Road near \\"Shotgun Bend\\" at an elevation over 1500 feet) joins Adobe Creek by the Duveneck's main house at Hidden Villa. The North Fork Adobe Creek is also known locally as Bunny Creek. The upper watershed of Adobe Creek is completely protected by Hidden Villa and the Mid-Peninsula Regional Open Space District. Below the confluences of the \\"three forks\\", Adobe Creek is joined by three seasonal creeks in Los Altos Hills. The first is Moody Creek (known locally as Silver Creek) and named for George Washington Moody (1824‚Äì1909), a farmer who lived along the stream. His home was located on Moody Creek (which flows down along Central Drive and then Moody Court to its confluence with Adobe Creek). Moody built Moody Road in 1867. The next Adobe Creek tributary is Purisima Creek (historically known as Purissima Creek and originating between Altamont Road and Dezahara Way and joining Adobe Creek at Deepwater Lane and Bay Tree Lane) and Robleda Creek (along Robleda Road) in Los Altos Hills. Thence, Adobe Creek departs mountainous and hilly terrain and enters the valley floor to descend through Los Altos, Mountain View, and Palo Alto. The creek's course runs . From 2003 to 2009, Upper Reach 5 of Adobe Creek (between Foothill Expressway and West Edith Avenue) was restored in an innovative partnership called the Adobe Creek Watershed Group with representatives from the Santa Clara Valley Water District, local residents and representatives of the City of Los Altos and the Town of Los Altos Hills. The $7.2 million project improved flood conveyance capacity in Reach 5, and also enhanced the creek ecosystem by removing the existing concrete banks and bottom, repairing and stabilizing the eroded banks using minimal hardscape, removing many non-native trees, and establishing a riparian area along of bank using mostly shrubs and trees native to the Adobe Creek watershed, as well as non-native California redwoods. Further downstream, the Palo Alto/Los Altos bike path traverses the creek, running along the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct right of way. Several sections of Adobe Creek have been re-aligned, including the trapezoidal concrete drainage channel between El Camino Real and U.S. Highway 101 (the portion between Alma Street and El Camino Real was constructed by the SCVWD in 1959). Also, in 1956, Pink Horse Ranch developer Wendell Roscoe, re-directed Adobe Creek into a new straight line channel next to Moody Road that he dug to redirect the water along the edge of his subdivision \\"in order to prevent a repeat of two 100-year floods which left the 40 acre Pink Horse Ranch under 2 feet of water\\". Roscoe installed a flood gate at 12243 Tepa Way which can redirect the flows into the old Adobe Creek channel. In 1975, an 8-foot pipe bypass intended to prevent flooding of properties along Adobe Creek was constructed starting near the intersection of Moody and El Monte Roads (on the Foothill College Campus) going upstream approximately 2,200 feet, ending just upstream of Tepa Way. The original creek channel is now a secondary water \\"bypass channel\\" that bears high winter water flows from Adobe Creek and meanders through several properties in the Adobe Lane subdivision before passing under Moody Road and returning to the mainstem at the southeast corner of Foothill College. Before passing under Highway 101, Adobe Creek is joined by Barron Creek just upstream of Highway 101. Barron Creek was alternatively known as Dry Creek, and appears as a tributary of Adobe Creek in the 1862 Allardt Map, although in the 1899 Topo Map it was tributary to Matadero Creek, and was much later diverted back to Adobe Creek. Barron Creek is long, originating in the Los Altos Hills foothills at elevation along La Paloma Road (just north of Alta Tierra Road), then flowing north along La Paloma Road, then it is joined by a Concepcion Road fork at Fremont Road and proceeds along Fremont Road behind Pinewood School, before turning northeasterly along Arastradero Road where it is joined by another minor fork originating in Esther Clark Park. After crossing Foothill Expressway it is buried in an underground pipe just west of Gunn High School but sees daylight where the creek crosses Bol Park Bike Path in a small, man-made flood control basin, then at Laguna Avenue again enters an underground pipe running beneath Los Robles Avenue to El Camino Real. Barron Creek has been greatly modified for flood control purposes; the creek bed downstream from El Camino Real is a concrete trapezoidal channel. After passing under Highway 101, Adobe Creek enters the Palo Alto Flood Basin just west of a levee at the end of San Antonio Road. This levee separates Charleston Slough on the east from Mayfield Slough on the west and is also the eastern border of the Palo Alto Baylands. The Flood Basin is maintained a couple feet below sea level in order to absorb floodwaters from Adobe Creek and Matadero Creek. By lowering the basin, what was once tidal saltwater marsh is now predominantly freshwater marsh. Adobe Creek is joined by Matadero Creek at the north end of Mayfield Slough, where it historically joined with San Francisquito Creek before the latter was diverted north. Mayfield Slough has a tidal gate through which fresh water passes to San Francisco Bay, and some salt water is permitted to return to Mayfield Slough when the tides are higher. In the 1800s the Baylands marshes ended between Alma and El Camino Real in Palo Alto, which explains why historical maps show area creeks appearing to terminate before they reach the Bay. Duck-hunting blinds were common in the nineteenth century along what is now Middlefield Road. The 1862 Allardt map shows Adobe Creek, then Yeguas Creek, having dual termini ‚Äì one in the Baylands Marsh and the other to San Francisquito Creek just before entering San Francisco Bay. Watercourse gallery Habitat and wildlife Mallard in May just above Edith Street bridge, the creek now runs dry by summer, but was once a year-round trout stream This drop under the Hidden Villa bridge is one of several barriers to steelhead trout spawning runs on Adobe Creek 2010 American white pelicans wintering on Adobe Creek in the Palo Alto Flood Basin Dec., 2010 Pelicans, geese, egret, and other birds in Adode Creek's slough in 2003 The creek also flows through Redwood Grove, a nature preserve off University Avenue in Los Altos purchased by the city in 1974. In October, 2009 Los Altos contracted with Acterra to remove non-native plants and revitalize the redwood, oak woodland, riparian and grassland ecosystems by installing native plants, improving soil conditions, and creating habitat for wildlife such as bird houses and native bee boxes. The coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) were transplanted by the Halsey family from a location on Summit Road in the Santa Cruz Mountains and replaced the native willows. At Manresa Bridge at the east edge of Redwood Grove one can see the native red willow (Salix laevigata) and arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis) trees. The historic Halsey House, built in the late 1920s by Theodore and Emma Halsey, is a good example of Spanish Revival architecture. The city designated Halsey House a local landmark in 1981 and until recently it housed the Florence Fava collection of Coastanoan or Ohlone Indian artifacts from a creekside archeological excavation in Los Altos Hills (now moved to the Los Altos History House). On June 16, 2010 the Los Altos City Council finalized the purchase of of creekside property from Delbert and Marlene Beumer, who wanted to provide a safe pathway connecting Shoup Park and Redwood Grove. Existing native riparian trees include willows (Salix species), California sycamore (Platanus racemosa) in Redwood Grove and near the ranch manager's house at Hidden Villa, white alder (Alnus rhombifolia) (one large specimen in Redwood Grove ‚Äì see photo), cottonwood (Populus) at the top of the Moody Creek tributary, bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), California buckeye (Aesculus californica), California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) and California walnut (Juglans californica). Steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) occurred historically in Adobe Creek based on a report touting the trout in the Sportsman's Gazetteer in 1877. This very early report makes rumors that Adobe Creek's trout were introduced extremely unlikely since the first trout hatcheries in California did not propagate any trout until the 1870s, and much of their production was shipped to hatcheries out of state. A physical specimen was collected in 1893 by Stanford Biology Professor W. W. Thoburn and is in the California Academy of Sciences collection. In 1898 John Otterbein Snyder collected steelhead trout specimens in San Antonio Creek (now Adobe Creek). A 1909 land office brochure promoted Los Altos for its \\"never-failing mountain trout stream, trout caught a few feet from kitchen doors\\". The reaches upstream from Hidden Villa have been judged excellent trout spawning habitat. Josephine Duveneck wrote, \\"Before the era of concrete, fish used to swim up to spawn and native trout lured many a small boy to seek out the deeper pools carrying his home-made fishing pole and can of worms.\\" Local historian Florence Fava also reported that \\"the creeks which lace the (Hidden Villa) property and join Adobe Creek were originally full of fish\\". Steelhead often were caught using large wet flies with 2x tippet during the early 1970s. Locations that held spawning steelhead included the large cement pieces downstream from the Foothill Junior College paint shop outflow and cut banks just below Interstate 280. According to the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), steelhead were caught by local fishermen during 1985, 1986 and 1987 in Mayfield Slough at the confluence of Matadero and Adobe Creeks. At least six steelhead were noted passing the tidal gates at Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin in April 1987. There are many formidable obstacles to fish passage on Adobe Creek, including whether the fish ladder below El Camino Real is cluttered with debris, and drop structures above culverts under Interstate 280 and Foothill Expressway. The long concrete trapezoidal channel structure from El Camino Real northward to Highway 101 challenges fish with thin sheets of rapid horizontal flow during winter. Additional barriers occur at the O'Keefe Lane and Hidden Villa bridges, and the creek suffers from significant bank erosion, failing channel stabilization structures, and sedimentation. Finally, the trash rack at the tidal gate at the mouth of Mayfield Slough is an intermittent complete barrier to fish passage when it is closed. Four species of native fishes have been collected from Adobe Creek recently: California roach, Sacramento sucker, three-spined stickleback, and prickly sculpin. Leidy reported the fish still inhabiting the Adobe Creek's lowest reach in 2007 ‚Äì native California roach (Lavinia symmetricus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and non-native common carp (Cyprinus carpio), rainwater killifish (Lucania parva), and western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). A 2011 fish survey showed only native fish above El Camino Real: the reach above Redwood Grove and the Manresa Lane bridge in Los Altos included California roach, Sacramento sucker and three-spined stickleback ‚Äì an assemblage that generally includes steelhead trout in other Bay Area streams. Further upstream, the fish assemblage steadily diminishes due to passage barriers and reduced stream flows from diversions and wells: at Moody Road just above Foothill College, only California roach and three-spined stickleback were collected, at Rhus Ridge bridge in Los Altos Hills only three-spined stickleback were collected, and at the Francemont Avenue bridge and along the Adobe Creek Trail at Hidden Villa no fish were found. Palo Alto Flood Basin Jim McCarthy, Adobe Creek streamkeeper, was honored by the Santa Clara County Creeks Coalition for his work to restore the creek. Here he measures temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, copper levels, and turbidity 2010. The Palo Alto Flood Basin was constructed in 1956 in order to prevent a repeat of the floods of 1955, when a high tide prevented the escape of heavy runoff from Matadero, Adobe, and Barron Creeks into the San Francisco Bay. The trapped runoff waters overflowed upstream creek banks and caused severe flooding in Palo Alto. In order to control the flow of water into the flood basin, a tidegate was placed at the confluence of Adobe Creek, Matadero Creek, and the San Francisco Bay, so that the flood basin could be maintained at approximately 2 feet below sea level, creating room to absorb floodwaters. The tidegate consists of several weirs and one operator-controlled sluice gate that enables tidal flows into the basin in order to improve water quality and for mosquito control. Three agencies oversee the tidegates: Santa Clara Valley Water District, City of Palo Alto, and Santa Clara County Vector Control. Because the trash grate and weirs separate the mouth of the flood basin from the San Francisco Bay estuary, large fish cannot swim freely between the Bay and the basin, unless the sluice gate is open. In addition, the tidegates are set to reduce tidal inflows into the basin, so that the basin is mostly freshwater. After a rainstorm the tidegate is kept closed, however this is precisely when steelhead trout in-migrations should occur. In 2002 a small opening was cut in the trash grate on the tidal gate to permit fish passage but local fisherman in the Flood Basin no longer report catching steelhead trout in recent years. From November 16 to 20, 2002, approximately 100 striped bass (Morone saxatilis), 5 bat rays (Myliobatis californica) and 2 leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) were found dead in the Flood Control Basin in both Adobe and Matadero Creeks within one mile of the tidegate. The fishkill was attributed to the first large rainstorm washing a large amount of leaf litter into the basin, leading to eutrophication and low dissolved oxygen. This is supported by the fact that the dead fish were all large (requiring more oxygen) at 2 to 4 feet long and the mouths and gills of the bass were fully extended open. Trails and recreation Loop trail The San Francisco Bay Trail, which passes in a loop around both sides of the Palo Alto Flood Basin is known as the Adobe Creek Loop Trail and is easily accessed from a parking lot at the northern terminus of San Antonio Road, just north of U.S. Highway 101. A scenic, easy walking or mountain biking trail, it also provides outstanding birdwatching and in winter is known for its flock of American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). The Adobe Creek Loop Trail begins by heading north along the levee between Adobe Creek and the Charleston Slough out to the confluence of Adobe Creek and Matadero Creek. As one heads north on the levee, Charleston Slough is on the right and Adobe Creek is on the left. The Charleston Slough is a rich salt marsh and littoral zone, providing feeding areas for a variety of shorebirds and other estuarine wildlife. At low tide Charleston Slough looks like a salt pond, like the Cargill salt ponds to the east of it, but it is open to tidal flow. Pumps and gates regulate the flow through the slough. Water from the slough gets pumped into Shoreline Lake, which then drains into Permanente Creek. The slough was named after George Charleston, who came from Scotland in 1852 and purchased of marshland in this area. Charleston Road and Charleston Court also bear his name. Continuing north, the wide, curving Loop Trail eventually touches San Francisco Bay itself and curves to the west, crossing over the tidal gate of Mayfield Slough and enters the Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve. The sailing station boat launching dock is visible on the opposite shore of the channel at the mouth of the former Palo Alto Yacht Harbor. Baylands Nature Preserve surrounds what used to be the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor, now a silted-in mud flat and marsh which provides excellent birding. The Adobe Creek Loop Trail then heads back southwest with Matadero Creek on the left and Byxbee Park (former landfill) on the right, eventually connecting to the Bay Trail at East Bayshore Road. Heading east along East Bayshore Road, turn immediately left after crossing over Adobe Creek to return on the Bay Trail to the San Antonio Road parking lot. Other trails Many locals enjoy the natural setting of a short walk through Redwood Grove, of which portions are on an elevated wooden boardwalk. In 1986 the city of Los Altos was granted an open space easement on the south bank of Adobe Creek and developed a trail from the south end of Redwood Grove to the Manresa Lane Bridge. Hidden Villa is the starting point for the relatively gentle Adobe Creek Trail, an easy two mile hike upstream along a cool, wooded canyon. Two routes connect Hidden Villa to the Black Mountain Trail at Ewing Hill at of elevation, the Hostel Trail (1.3 miles) or the Creek Trail (1 mile) connecting to the Ewing Trail (0.3 miles). The Black Mountain Trail then continues up a strenuous to the summit of Black Mountain. Another \\"Adobe Creek Trail\\" is found in the Monte Bello Open Space Preserve, which is an easy to moderate 1.4 mile hike that begins on Montebello Road about 0.1 miles east of Page Mill Road and rejoins Montebello Road after traversing the headwaters of the West Fork Adobe Creek as well as a large meadow with views of the South Bay.

First epistle Author identifies himself as Peter The author of the First Epistle of Peter identifies himself in the opening verse as \\"Peter, an apostle of Jesus\\", and the view that the epistle was written by St. Peter is attested to by a number of Church Fathers: Irenaeus (140‚Äì203), Tertullian (150‚Äì222), Clement of Alexandria (155‚Äì215) and Origen of Alexandria (185‚Äì253). If Polycarp, who was martyred in 156, and Papias alluded to this letter, then it must have been written before the mid-2nd century. However, the Muratorian Canon of c. 170 did not contain this, and a number of other General epistles, suggesting they were not yet being read in the Western churches. Unlike The Second Epistle of Peter, the authorship of which was debated in antiquity (see also Antilegomena), there was little debate about Peter‚Äôs authorship of The First Epistle of Peter until the advent of biblical criticism in the 18th century. Assuming the letter is authentic and written by Peter, who was martyred c. 64, the date of this epistle is probably between 60 and 64. Theory of Silvanus as author One theory is that 1 Peter was written by a secretary such as Mark or by Silvanus, who is mentioned towards the end of the epistle: \\"By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written unto you briefly\\" (5:12). In the following verse the author includes greetings from \\"she that is in Babylon, elect together with you,\\" taken for the church \\"in Babylon\\", which may be an early use of this Christian title for Rome, familiar from the Book of Revelation. \\"There is no evidence that Rome was called Babylon by the Christians until the Book of Revelation was published, i.e. c. 90‚Äì96 AD,\\" say the editors of The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, who therefore conclude that Babylon on the Euphrates was intended. See also Syriac Christianity. Use of Greek and Hebrew Many scholars believe the author was not Peter, but an unknown author writing after Peter's death. Estimates for the date of composition range from 60 to 112 AD. Most critical scholars are skeptical that the apostle Simon Peter, the fisherman on the Sea of Galilee, actually wrote the epistle, because of the urbane cultured style of the Greek and the lack of any personal detail suggesting contact with the historical Jesus of Nazareth. The letter contains about thirty-five references to the Hebrew Bible, all of which, however, come from the Septuagint translation, an unlikely source for historical Peter the apostle, but appropriate for a Hellenized audience; thus the use of the Septuagint helps define the audience. The Septuagint was a Greek translation that had been created at Alexandria for the use of those Jews who could not easily read the Hebrew and Aramaic of the Tanakh, and for proselytes. A historical Jew in Galilee would not have heard Scripture in this form, it is argued. Pseudepigraphy written around 70‚Äì90 If the epistle is taken to be pseudepigraphal, the majority scholarly view, according to Raymond E. BrownRaymond E. Brown, An Introduction to the New Testament, p. 722 is that it should be dated to 70‚Äì90, an opinion shared by scholars such as Eric Eve (Oxford Bible Commentary, p. 1263), John H. Elliott (The Anchor Bible Dictionary, art. \\"First Epistle of Peter\\"),Quotations from these scholars are given in Early Christian Writings. and by Bart D. Ehrman.Ehrman, Bart D. The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings. 2d ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. Stephen L. Harris, on the other hand, holds that most scholars argue for an even later date, such as during the persecution of Domitian (c. 95) or of Trajan (c. 112).Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. Authority associated with Peter The author's use of Peter's name demonstrates the authority associated with Peter.\\"Pseudonymity does not lessen the importance of this writing as a witness to Peter, If anything, it enhances its importance since it implies that some 20 or 30 years after his death Peter's name could still be thought to carry weight and be invoked to instruct Christian churches, especially in the area of Asia Minor (...) addressed is not Petrine Territory.\\"Anchor Bible Dictionary (David Noel Freedman, ed) vol 5, (\\"O-Sh\\"), p. 262. The author also claims to have witnessed the sufferings of Christ (1 Peter 5:1) and makes allusions to several historical sayings of Jesus indicative of eyewitness testimony (e.g., compare Luke 12:35 with 1 Peter 1:13, Matthew 5:16 with 1 Peter 2:12, and Matthew 5:10 with 1 Peter 3:14). Second Epistle Author presents himself as Peter The Second Epistle of Peter opens by identifying the author as ‚ÄúSimon Peter (in some translations, ‚ÄòSimeon‚Äô or ‚ÄòShimon‚Äô), a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ‚Äù () (spelling the name differently from 1 Peter or the rest of the New Testament, except for Acts 15:14). Elsewhere, the author clearly presents himself as the Apostle Peter, stating that the Lord revealed to him the approach of his own death (), that he was an eyewitness of the Transfiguration (), that he had previously written another epistle to the same audience (; cf. 1 Peter), and he called Paul the Apostle ‚Äúour beloved brother‚Äù (). Clues in support of pseudepigraphy Although 2 Peter internally purports to be a work of the apostle, most biblical scholars have concluded that Peter is not the author, and instead consider the epistle pseudepigraphical.What are they saying about the Catholic Epistles?, Philip B. Harner, p. 49 Reasons for this include its linguistic differences from 1 Peter, its apparent use of Jude, possible allusions to 2nd-century gnosticism, encouragement in the wake of a delayed parousia, and weak external support.Grant, Robert M. A Historical Introduction To The New Testament, chap. 14 . In addition, specific passages offer further clues in support of pseudepigraphy, namely the author's assumption that his audience is familiar with multiple Pauline epistles (), his implication that the Apostolic generation has passed (), and his differentiation between himself and \\"the apostles of the Lord and Savior\\" (). Arguments for Petrine authorship A minority of scholars have disagreed with this position and put forward reasons in support of genuine Petrine authorship. They argue that the letter did not fit a specific pattern of what they consider pseudepigraphy. The Transfiguration lacks the embellishment which E. M. B. Green argues was common in apocryphal books.E. M. B. Green, 2 Peter Reconsidered, p. 27. Michael Kruger argues that the voice of God in the Transfiguration is similar but not identical to the synoptic gospels, as if Peter was recalling from memory, and notes that the epistle uses similar language to Peter's speeches in Acts.Michael J. Kruger, The Authenticity of 2 Peter, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 42.4 (1999), pp. 645‚Äì71. An uncommon title, ‚Äúour beloved brother,‚Äù is given to Paul, where later literature used other titles.i.e. ‚Äúthe blessed Paul‚Äù, ‚Äúthe blessed and glorious Paul‚Äù, and ‚Äúthe sanctified Paul right blessed‚Äù, cited in: J. B. Major, The Epistle of St Jude and the Second Epistle of St Peter (1907), p. 166; Donald Guthrie, Introduction to the New Testament 4th ed. (Leicester: Apollos, 1990), p. 826; references to quotes from antiquity are 1 Clement 47.1 and Polycarp, Ad Phil. 11; Polycarp, Ad Phil. 3; Ignatius, Ad Eph. 12.2. Relation between 2 Peter and Jude 2 Peter shares a number of shared passages with the Epistle of Jude, 1:5 with Jude 3; 1:12 with Jude 5; 2:1 with Jude 4; 2:4 with Jude 6; 2:6 with Jude 7; 2:10‚Äì11 with Jude 8-9; 2:12 with Jude 10; 2:13‚Äì17 with Jude 11‚Äì13; 3:2f with Jude 17f; 3:14 with Jude 24; and 3:18 with Jude 25.T. Callan, \\"Use of the Letter of Jude by the Second Letter of Peter\\", Biblica 85 (2004), pp. 42‚Äì64. Because the Epistle of Jude is much shorter than 2 Peter, and due to various stylistic details, the scholarly consensus is that Jude was the source for the similar passages of 2 Peter.The Westminster dictionary of New Testament and early Christian literature, David Edward Aune, p. 256 Other scholars argue that even if 2 Peter used Jude, that does not exclude Petrine authorship.E. M. B. Green, 2 Peter Reconsidered (1961), pp. 10‚Äì11; ibid., ‚ÄòThe Second Epistle General of Peter and the General Epistle of Jude‚Äô, in Tyndale New Testament Commentary (1987). On remaining points, Ben Witherington III argued that the text we have today is a composite, including points taken from the Epistle of Jude, but that it contains a genuine ‚ÄúPetrine fragment‚Äù, which he identified as .Ben Witherington III, ‚ÄúA Petrine Source in 2 Peter‚Äù, Society of Biblical Literature Seminar Papers (1985), pp. 187‚Äì92. Finally, some scholars have proposed that differences in style could be explained by Peter having employed different amanuenses (secretaries) for each epistle, or if Peter wrote the second letter himself, while using Silvanus (Silas) as an amanuensis for the first.Paul Barnett, Jesus and the Rise of Early Christianity (Downers Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1999), 303‚Äì07. Two different authors Most scholars believe that 1 Peter and 2 Peter were not written by the same author(s). 1 Peter is essentially traditional, drawing on key Psalms, key chapters of Isaiah, and wisdom sayings, some of which are found elsewhere in the New Testament. 2 Peter, however, favors a more allusive style and is dependent on more obscure sources. Issue of authorship already settled for most scholars The great majority of scholars agree that Peter has not written this letter.The majority position of scholarship that 2 Peter is a pseudepigraph is apparent from the quotations given in the remainder of the paragraph, namely the comments by Daniel Wallace, Werner K√ºmmel, Stephen Harris, Douglas Moo and D.A. Carson. For example, textual critic Daniel Wallace (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for most experts, \\"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\\" and that \\"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopt this perspective without much discussion\\"Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline Werner K√ºmmel exemplifies this position, stating, \\"It is certain, therefore, that 2 Pet does not originate with Peter, and this is today widely acknowledged\\",2 Peter as does Stephen L Harris, who states that \\"[v]irtually no authorities defend the Petrine authorship of 2 Peter.\\"Harris, Stephen L.. Understanding the Bible: a reader's introduction, 2nd ed. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 354. Evangelical scholars D. A. Carson and Douglas J. Moo wrote that \\"most modern scholars do not think that the apostle Peter wrote this letter. Indeed, for no other letter in the New Testament is there a greater consensus that the person who is named as the author could not, in fact, be the author.\\"Carson, D.A., and Douglas J. Moo. An Introduction to the New Testament, second edition. HarperCollins Canada; Zondervan: 2005. , . p. 659. Despite this broad denial by the majority of modern scholars, other scholars view the arguments of the majority to be largely inconclusive.\\"Reflections on the Authorship of 2 Peter,\\" Evangelical Quarterly 73 [2001]: 291‚Äì309). Likewise, Stanley Porter points to the fact that 2 Peter's acceptance to the canon by early Christians presumes that they were sure that Peter wrote it.\\"Pauline Authorship and the Pastoral Epistles: Implications for Canon,\\" BBR 5 (1995): 105‚Äì23 In the end, Carson and Moo point to the controversy reflective of this issue, stating, \\"We are therefore left with the choice of accepting the letter's prima facie claim to have been written by the apostle Peter or viewing it as a forgery hardly deserving of canonical status.\\"Carson, D.A., and Douglas J.

Epigrams in the seventh book of the Greek Anthology commemorate a dolphin, a cicada, a partridge, a swallow, a jay, an ant, a grasshopper, a rabbit, a horse, and, most famously, a Maltese watchdog.by Tymnes, 7.211 The funerary relief of Edessa is unique in antiquity in commemorating a pig and a traffic accident.We know only about chariot race accidents in classical antiquity. Hippolytus and Pergamon Museum, c. 300 CE Cf. English-Latin poem: Hic jacet porcus fulgure ictus - On a pig killed in thunder-storm While the inscription is noteworthy for its description of the Via Egnatia and information on Phallic processions, the main controversy concerns the interpretation of the word CHOIROS, inscribed like the rest of the poem in Greek majuscule. Is the inscription about a pig (choiros) or a man named Choiros? Choirilos is attested as a name, as are other personal names such as Choiron, Choirothyon (\\"pig-sacrificer\\"), Choiridion, Choirine (-a), Choiro, Choiris (female) and around twenty males were named Choiros.ŒßŒøŒπœÅŒø- If the inscription refers to an actual pig the story might be reconstructed as follows: A pig-merchant, engaged in business on the Via Egnatia, bought pigs from Dalmatia and conveyed them on a chariot. At Edessa, a pig fell off the chariot and was crushed under the wheel. An artist and poet created the relief and epitaph, either commissioned by the merchant or on their own. The information that the pig travelled on foot alone steadily would be intended humorously; so too the comment that it longed to see the Dionysiac Phallic processions, if indeed pigs were sacrificed there.a usual offer to Greek and Roman deities, see pig in religion Another possible reconstruction is that pigs, bought in Dalmatia, were walking down a road in Edessa, led by a priest for the Dionysiac festival, when a chariot or the Phallic chariot crushed one. This may explain the fact that two pigs are depicted. If the inscription refers to a man named Choiros we might interpret it thus: A slave freed (as an offered gift) at Dalmatia, traveled alone on the Via Egnatia to his friends or relatives. At Edessa, he died in a chariot accident. Artists who heard the story made the relief and poem, playing on his name. In Christian funerary steles, a certain Pontius Leo had a lion depicted on his epitaph and a little pig was added to that of a child named Porcella.Epitaphs of the catacombs, or, Christian inscriptions in Rome during the first four centuries by James Spencer Northcote Page 175 (1878) A third line of interpretation might see the poem and stele as a purely fictional creation.

Opened in 2009, the park is owned and operated by Metro, the regional government in the Oregon portion of the metro area. The park is named after Cooper Mountain, the primary geological feature in the area near Beaverton. Maintained by the regional Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation District, the natural area has of hiking trails. It is one of THPRD's two nature parks, along with the Tualatin Hills Nature Park. History Portland area voters approved a bond measure in 1995 that provided funding for the purchase of greenspaces by Metro. Metro covers most of Washington, Clackamas, and Multnomah counties in the northwest part of Oregon. Metro began buying land on Cooper Mountain near Aloha and Beaverton in 1997, and spent $6.58 million in total on land. Voters approved an additional bond in 2006, and Metro spent almost $2 million from that bond on facilities at Cooper Mountain. Metro also received a $500,000 grant from the Oregon Department of Parks and Recreation and a $40,000 grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for development of the park. To prepare the area for the park and help restore the native habitat, the area was burned in 2008. Cooper Mountain Nature Park opened on June 27, 2009. Through 2009, volunteers and Metro planted approximately 100,000 shrubs and trees at the park. Features Cooper Mountain Nature Park is located on the south side of the tall Cooper Mountain in eastern Washington County. The mountain, contrary to popular belief, is not a former volcano, but was formed due to basalt flows in the Tualatin Valley. The park's natural areas include groves of oak trees, wetlands, prairie, ponds, and forested areas. Metro owns the park, but will pay Tualatin Hills Parks and Recreation about $600,000 to maintain the park over a ten-year contract. The natural area is surrounded by agricultural lands to the south and urban development on the north. Cooper Mountain is between Oregon Route 10 and Oregon Route 210 south of Beaverton. Trail and young trees at the park looking south Amenities at the park include gardens, a nature center building, parking, bike racks, a children's playground, and of gravel trails. The nature center, called the Nature House, is used for educational programs and includes rest rooms, plus it is partly powered by solar panels. Birds at the park include the red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, bald eagle, western bluebird, several sparrow species, and the olive-sided flycatcher. Other animal species in the park include the northern red-legged frog, western gray squirrel, northern alligator lizard, and the rubber boa.

His father, Abul Hashim, was a prominent politician in the Indian subcontinent. Early life, education, and career Umar was born in Bardhaman, Bengal Presidency, British India. Although his father Abul Hashim, a clandestine Communist, opposed the creation of East Pakistan, Hashim decided to move to East Pakistan and settled in Dhaka in 1950.http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090622/jsp/opinion/story_11137241.jsp Umar received his MA in philosophy from University of Dhaka and his BA Honors degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) from University of Oxford. Umar began his academic career as a teacher at University of Dhaka on a temporary basis. In 1963, he joined Rajshahi University as the founder-chair of the political science department. He also founded the department of sociology at the same university, but he resigned from his university positions during the hostile times of the then East Pakistan governor Abdul Monem Khan to become increasingly more active and engaged as a full-time leftist political activist and public intellectual to fight for the cause of oppressed peasants and workers in Bangladesh. Political activism As a follower of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist principles, Umar began writing anti-colonial articles from the 1970s. In the 1960s he wrote three groundbreaking books‚ÄîSampradayikata (Communalism, 1966),Communalism in Undivided Bengal: shrouding Class Conflict with Religion Sanskritir Sankat (The Crisis of Culture, 1967), and Sanskritik Sampradayikata (Cultural Communalism, 1969)‚Äîthat theorise the dialectics of the political culture of 'communalism' and the question of Bengali nationalism,The Emergence of Bangladesh thus making significant intellectual contributions to the growth of Bengali nationalism itself. In 1969, Umar joined the East Pakistan Communist Party, and from February 1970 to March 1971, Umar edited the mouthpiece of the East Pakistan Communist Party‚ÄîSaptahik Ganashakti‚Äîwhich published essays and articles about the problems and prospects of the communist movement in Pakistan. He was president of both Bangladesh Krishak Federation (Bangladesh Peasant Federation) and Bangladesh Lekhak Shibir‚Äîthe country's oldest organisation of progressive writers, intellectuals, and cultural activists. Currently he is President of the Jatiya Mukti CouncilJatiya Mukti Council calls for lifting of emergency (National Liberation Council). Books Umar has written nearly a hundred books and countless articles. The majority of his books discuss the problems and possibilities of the democratic and socialist transformation of class society. He lucidly and thoroughly exposes the lumpenbourgeoisie's political culture in Bangladesh. In his books he discusses a wide range of issues including the political economy and culture of capitalism, world socialist movements, communist movements in Bangladesh, the phenomena of militarism and military dictatorships in the Third World, criminalisation of politics, business, and so on.

The division traces its history to the 66th Rifle Division of World War II.  Formation and World War II  The division was originally formed on 14 May 1932 in village of Lutkovka-Medveditskoye in the Shmakovsky raion of the Ussuriisk Oblast, Far Eastern Military District, as the 2nd Collective Farm Division. It was renamed the 66th Rifle Division on 21 May 1936. The division formed part of the 35th Army of the Maritime Group of Forces in the Far East in May 1945. In August 1945 the division, as a part of 1st Far East Front, participated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. On 9 August 1945 the division began operations as part of 35th Army, advancing 12 kilometers, having forced the Songacha River in northern Heilongjiang. The division fought on the Ussuri River at Khotunsky (–•–æ—Ç—É–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ), Mishan, Border (–ü–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ), and Duninsky (–î—É–Ω–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ) fortified districts, capturing the cities of Mishan, Jilin, Jantszy, and Harbin. For its valour in combat and courage on 19 September 1945 the 66th Rifle Division was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, Second Degree. Three Hero of the Soviet Union medals, 1266 awards, and 2838 medals were given to the division's personnel.  Postwar  On 29 November 1945 it was reorganised as the 2nd Tank Division, but was renamed again in 1957 as the 32nd Tank Division and in 1965 as the 66th Tank Division. On 30 March 1970 the division became the 277th Motor Rifle Division.Feskov 2013, p. 589 In May 1981 the division headquarters was relocated to Sergeyevka.

These changes effectively made the division a motor rifle formation though its designation was still that of a static defence formation.

The pamphlet sold 150,000 copies by the end of 1874.Philip Magnus, Gladstone: A Biography (London: John Murray, 1963), pp. 235‚Äì6. Church and State Gladstone claimed that the decree had placed British Catholics in a dilemma over their loyalty to the Crown and their loyalty to the Pope. He urged British Catholics to reject papal infallibility as they had opposed the Spanish Armada of 1588. Rule of law against despotism He described the Catholic Church as \\"an Asian monarchy: nothing but one giddy height of despotism, and one dead level of religious subservience\\". He further claimed that the Pope wanted to destroy the rule of law and replace it with arbitrary tyranny and then to hide these \\"crimes against liberty beneath a suffocating cloud of incense\\". Later pamphlet in 1875 In February 1875, Gladstone published a second anti-Catholic pamphlet, which was a defence of his earlier pamphlet and a reply to his critics, Vaticanism: an Answer to Reproofs and Replies.

Life Schr√∂der was the son of a teacher. He went to Berlin where he studied philosophy, literature, history and art history. He gained his doctorate with a dissertation on art history. He then worked as a private tutor. By 1913 he was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and in 1914 became a research assistant at the SPD Zentralbildungsausschuss for workers' education. During this period, he became friends with Franz Mehring and developed his connection to the labor movement. After participating in the First World War, Karl Schroeder joined the Spartacus League in 1918, and shortly afterwards was appointed editor of Rote Fahn (Red Flag), the central organ of the Communist Party (KPD). In 1919 he was expelled from the KPD along with the majority of the party who went on to form the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD). Alongside Alexander Schwab, he rose to become a leading member of the KAPD and the editor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung (Workers newspaper). He travelled to Moscow where he met Lenin, Trotsky and Bukharin. After the Third Congress of the Comintern (June 22-July 12, 1921), he distanced himself from the Comintern and was expelled from the KAPD in 1922 as leader of the Essen Tendency. After the attempt to develop the KAPD in Essen failed, Schr√∂der returned to the SPD at the instigation of Paul Levi. In subsequent years, he became a novelist, editor and publisher active in the social democratic workers' education service. He was also active in the Sozialistische Arbeiter-Jugend (SAJ). As Schr√∂der retained his Councilist approach, and sought to gain support for these views in the SAJ and SPD, this could be regarded as entryism. In 1928 with support from Frederick Wendel, Karl Schr√∂der became head of Circle Books, a Berlin book club. He held this position until 1932. (Both knew each other from the Berlin group of KAPD.) Also in 1928, together with Alexander Schwab, he began to organise the Council Communist Rote K√§mpfer (Red Fighters). After the Nazi seizure of power, Schroeder worked as a bookseller in Berlin. The Gestapo penetrated the Rote K√§mpfer in 1936, and arrested Schroeder. The following year he was sentenced to four years in prison and then detained in several concentration camps. In B√∂rgermoor he met up with his longtime collaborator Alexander Schwab. In 1945 he was close to death, but he recovered again. He worked for the reconstruction of the Berlin school system and adult education. At the same time he tried to reorganise in former members of the Rote K√§mpfer in West Berlin. In 1948 he joined the SED, which his associates claim was tactically motivated, to gain a lecturing position.

Since then, Jonathan has starred/been featured in over 100 productions for stage, radio, TV and film, and has appeared in almost every regional theatre in Canada, and in many in the United States. His first large role in a film was in Heyday!, by Gordon Pinsent, which won a Silver Hugo Award at the Chicago Film Festival.Toronto Star, With a Little Help From His Friends, October 3, 2004 the original Canadian cast of The Producers, and starred in the North American premiere of Glorious.NOW Magazine, Jon Kaplan interview, October 2006. As a composer, lyricist, and librettist, Jonathan has written over forty original pieces for theatre, film, and TV. Calgary Sun theatre critic Louis B. Hobson wrote in one of his reviews: \\"Monro deserves to be compared to such giants as Sondheim and Lehrer\\".Calgary Sun, November 7, 2007 His most recent work is a musical adaptation of The Hockey Sweater, based on the iconic short story by Roch Carrier, co-written with Emil Sher, and directed by Donna Feore. The Hockey Sweater played to sold out houses in Montreal (Segal Centre) and Ottawa (National Arts Centre). Other notable works include the score for the feature film A Christmas Fury, starring Mary Walsh (CBC), the World Premieres of AfterImage,NOW Magazine, Shockingly Good, April 20, 2009 and Fear of Flight (which was featured at the Cultural Olympiad in Vancouver, February 2010). His first musical, Variations on a Nervous Breakdown, won four Betty Mitchell Awards (including two for Monro). As a musical director, Jonathan has worked on over thirty productions, including the World Premiere of Alan Menken and David Spencer's The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, directed by Austin Pendleton, for which he subsequently co- produced the Original Cast Recording, the North American Premiere of Piaf/Dietrich (Mirvish Productions), the Canadian Premieres of Fun Home (Ovation Award Nomination), The Light in the Piazza (Betty Award Nomination), and Floyd Collins (Jessie Award Nomination), both with scores by his composition mentor, Adam Guettel. Jonathan is currently the Musical Director for the Toronto production of Piaf/Dietrich (Mirvish), and his new play, \\"Nothing in Between\\", will soon enter the workshop phase.

Agroscope makes an important contribution to a sustainable agriculture and food sector as well as to an intact environment, thereby contributing to an improved quality of life.  Goals  Agroscope researches along the entire value chain of the agriculture and food sector. Its aims are a competitive and multifunctional agricultural sector, high-quality food for a healthy diet, and an intact environment. The Research Station gears its work to the needs of the recipients of its services.  History  History until 1850 The importance in many regions of the Swiss Plateau was dominated for centuries by the three-field technique. This three-span rotation was divided as follows: **1st Year: Winter wheat **2nd Year: Summer grain (usually oats or barley) **3rd Year: fallow In each field possessed the farmer his individual acre. It was not a working association of farmers, but of a village community. The three-field did not let an intensive livestock. The common grazing on the fallow, the unfertilized Allmend and the stubble fields, and the lack of winter feeding offered only a meager food. For centuries, forest trees were debranched for winter feed. Agriculture froze in the three-field. For agriculture, the 18th Century, means the dawn of a new, better era. Young country gentlemen took the management of their estates into their own hands and sought to agriculture, especially livestock raising and promote. The chains of the three-field technique were broken. They began with the stall- feeding, careful storage of manure, and built on the former fields potatoes and clover. The common land was parceled out and divided among the peasants. A new goal came to the fore, namely, to keep enough cattle to supply their own country with enough manure. In the midst of these developments, the French Revolution broke out. The world was open for innovations.Lehmann, Josef 2003:13-15 First stations for education an controlling (1850‚Äì1880) During the second half of the 19th century, humans had to adapt to the requirements of an industrialized community. Completely new technologies changed their lives and natural sciences offered completely different explanations for life procedures and agricultural production than before. In the 19th century Switzerland therefore starts to install local agricultural institutes. With the new Federal Constitution of 1848 the modern welfare state begins to develop. In the Fifties the first, however very modest agricultural subsidies were paid to farmers.cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:19-23 Till the middle of the 19th century people had to cultivate their bread grain by themselves. For the authorities, the major task of agriculture was the self-sufficiency of states with grain. Only until 1860, larger quantities of grain were imported from the Danube countries and from overseas.cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:27 The birth of the research stations (1874‚Äì1914) The Federal Government's first step towards agricultural research stations was the development of ETH Zurich, where the first two federal agricultural experimental stations were established in 1878: the Swiss Federal Seed Control Station and the Swiss Federal Agricultural Chemistry Experimental Station. Both stations grew very quickly. The Seed Control Station in particular developed into a world-renowned institute. Its founder, Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler led it expertly and successfully for 42 years. The topics studied included fertilisers and feedstuffs, soils, milk, wines, farm fertilisers etc.. A focal point was the further development of analysis methods.cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:29 This provided the starting point for the subsequent founding of the Reckenholz location of the present-day Agroscope Reckenholz-T√§nikon Research Station (ART). However, the second location, T√§nikon TG, was only opened in 1970, at that time as a research station for rural economics and agricultural engineering.cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5 At the end of the 19th century, the vines of West Switzerland were devastated by disease. This marked the establishment of the Vaud Vine Research Station in 1886 and ultimately also the Swiss Federal Research Station in Changins, which resulted from the amalgamation of the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Chemistry (founded in 1886), the Swiss Federal Seed Control Laboratory (founded in 1898) and the Swiss Federal Vine Research Station (founded in 1915). The Experimental Station for Fruit Production, Viticulture and Horticulture in W√§denswil had already existed since 1890. The Federal Government took over this station in 1902.cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5 These two locations, Changins and W√§denswil, merged more than a hundred years later to form the Agroscope Changins-W√§denswil Research Station (ACW). At the end of the 19th century the Federal Government built a new experimental station, including a vegetation building and an experimental cheese dairy, in Liebefeld, Bern. The buildings became operational in 1901. Liebefeld thus became the location for the following three stations: the \\"Experimental Station for Agricultural Chemistry\\", the \\"Swiss Dairy Farming Experimental Station\\" and the estate farm for permits for the sale of agricultural supplies with head office.cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5 This head office of the Swiss agricultural experimental and test stations resulted in the Farm Animal Research Station. It moved its location to Posieux FR in 1974.cf. Sieber, Robert; R√ºegg, Max 2002:5 The Liebefeld and Posieux locations merged exactly one hundred years after their foundation to form the Agroscope Liebefeld- Posieux Research Station (ALP). In 1874 the Federal Government decided to build the Federal Foal Centre in Thun for breeding Freiberger stallions. In 1927 ten mares were added, and the foal centre became the Swiss Federal Stud. Since 1998 it has been called the Swiss National Stud. Since 2009 it has belonged to the ALP-Haras unit, together with Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux (ALP).cf. Website Agroscope: Gest√ºt This laid the foundation for Agroscope's present three agricultural research stations. First World War (1914‚Äì1918) As on 1 August 1914 the First World War broke out, Switzerland was totally unprepared: inadequate food production in their own country and the supplies from the country interrupted. Switzerland imported at that time about 85% of the cereal demand. These bottlenecks particularly in the food supply during the First World War broke out in agricultural research, big changes. The priorities of research, more and more placed on agriculture and issues of grassland and livestock took place in the background.Lehmann, Josef 2003:37-39 Between the World Wars (1919‚Äì1938) After the end of World War people wanted as soon as possible return to a free market. This had disastrous consequences for agriculture. During the First World War, the prices of agricultural commodities were increased significantly, later collapsed brutally. The importance of cereal crops for food security had been detected and forget the bad experiences at the beginning of World War II. Thus, the Federal Council tried shortly after the war to domestic cereal production by an import monopoly, combined with the acquisition of the domestic crop at a guaranteed price to support and protect against the fluctuations of the global market.Lehmann, Josef 2003:51-52 On 1 January 1920 the two research stations \\"Swiss seed Investigation and Research\\" and \\"Swiss agricultural chemistry research institution\\" were combined. As of this date was also the new name: Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich ‚Äì Oerlikon (ELVA).Lehmann, Josef 2003:53 Second World War (1939‚Äì1945) In an effort to learn from past mistakes and, if possible not to repeat them, people responded pretty quickly, as the political events of the situation in Europe got worse more and more. In time the war preventions measures were initiated. At the beginning of World War I all wartime measures were taken from case to case out of nothing and had to be put out, one was prepared when the war began in 1939 in various relationships significantly better.Lehmann, Josef 2003:65-66 With the outbreak of war, the Laboratory provided primarily in the service of the adaptation and reproduction of the agricultural production. End of September 1943, the federal government acquired the good Reckenholz on the northern border of Zurich-Affoltern.Lehmann, Josef 2003:70-71 Post-war years and the impact of the growing battle (1946‚Äì1960) Thanks to the American Marshall Plan enormous sums of money flowed into the western Europe. This allowed the so- called \\"post-war economic miracle.\\" The two to three decades after the war are known as an increasing time of euphoria and increased modernization. Agriculture also was included in an unprecedented structural change, her face changed dramatically. In 1947, the force during the war price controls lifted and the free competition replaced the official price control again.Lehmann, Josef 2003:83-85 Time since 1960 The Farm Act of 1951 underlined the idea that you can avoid by a generous promotion of agriculture, the overproduction of meat and milk, but proved to be deceptive. The situation, particularly in the dairy industry, coined the debates and actions of the agricultural policy in those years. In the European Community (EC) was the overproduction a big problem. During this period, they put the focus of research attention to the development of friendly production methods and improving the quality of the crop.Lehmann, Josef 2003:101-102 New concepts in agricultural politics (since 1996) The major problems with the current agricultural policy and the changing values of society in terms of environmental awareness and quality of life called urgently for new approaches in the agricultural policy. On 1 January 1 1999, the new farm bill with the main objectives \\"more market, more ecology‚Äù was put into force. It had become clear that the company long term was only an environmentally friendly, animal-friendly and tolerant of sustainability- oriented mode of production. The target was clear: a comprehensive, environmentally sound and resource efficient land management, which complies with the care and preservation of our cultural landscape.Lehmann, Josef 2003:137-138 A milestone to this is the so-called Integrated Production (IP). On the basis of different research and development projects at the Agroscope Changins-W√§denswil Research Station ACW in the Seventies and Sixties the Integrated Plant Protection ‚Äì and further on the Integrated Production for Switzerland ‚Äì was introduced, taking into account integrated pest control. Today, IP in Switzerland equals very often the production after the so-called √ñLN (‚Äúecological performance record‚Äù) or SUISSE GARANTIE. Regarding to a constantly growing world population and a threatening climate change the agricultural research has big challenges to overcome. The Agroscope research for agriculture, nutrition and environment is therefore an investment into our future.  Famous People  Jakob Gujer (1716‚Äì1785) A simple farmer who came as Kleinjogg from Kazereutihoff to great fame, and so was he probably the most famous Swiss farmer. alias \\"Chlyjogg\\" became famous by the Zurich city doctor Hans Caspar Hirzel, who published, in 1761, a small book called the \\"Economy of a peasant philosopher\\". Chlyjogg was born in 1716 in Wermatswil, where inherited a farm, that managed with great success by new methods devised by him. 1769 he took over the domain ‚ÄúKatzenr√ºtti‚Äù near the Reckenholz yards. The farm consisted of approximately 68 acres and meadows . Chlyjogg continued testing the methods invented in Wermatswil. He tested the application of gypsum and began to stall-feeding, to get more manure. Many important personalities such as Goethe and Duke Karl August of Weimar, visited the Katzenr√ºttihof. Other famous contemporaries such as Rousseau and Pestalozzi have acknowledged the successful of his work.Lehmann, Josef 2003:16-17 Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler (1842‚Äì1935) *Founder of the first Swiss seed and Laboratory Investigation Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler was born on 11 August in Safnern, in the Bernese Seeland, as the son of a farmer. In 1870 he joined the agricultural school R√ºtti. In 1875, he graduated as Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Leipzig. Later he founded a private seed control station in the Mattenhof in Bern. In 1876, he moved to Zurich in order to habilitated in the agricultural department of the Polytechnic. Under Stebler leadership, the seed control station also developed for the international seed trade recognized as a leading institution. 1889 to 1916 he headed the editorial board of the Swiss agricultural newspaper \\"The Green\\". On June 3, 1903, he was made an honorary member of the Highland Agricultural Society of Scotland in Edinburgh.Lehmann, Josef 2003:24-25 Ernst August Grete (1848‚Äì1919) *Member of the Board of Directors of the first Swiss agricultural chemistry research station Ernst August Grete was born 29 September 1848 in Celle (Hannover). He devoted himself to the university in G√∂ttingen to the study of classical philology and later moved into the educational seminar. After his philological studies, he joined the scientific side. In 1878 he was manager of the chemical test station at the agricultural department of the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. There he worked for more than 40 years.Lehmann, Josef 2003:35 Hermann M√ºller-Thurgau (1850‚Äì1927) *The first director of W√§denswil and father of the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed Hermann M√ºller was born in T√§gerwilen on Lake Constance. He studied natural sciences at ETH Zurich. In 1874 he was awarded a PhD in W√ºrzburg, Germany, and later became director of the Institute for Plant Physiology at the Geisenheim Research Station, Germany. In 1890 he became the first director of W√§denswil, the present-day Agroscope Changins-W√§denswil Research Station (ACW), and was a pioneer in the field of vine cultivation. He is considered the father of the M√ºller-Thurgau vine, which was crossed in 1882 and is the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed. With its success it displaced the old varieties, such as Elbling and R√§uschling, and up until today has remained the most successful specifically cultivated vine variety: More than 41,000 ha are cultivated worldwide, which corresponds to almost three times the total vine area of Switzerland. It is most widespread in Germany; in German-speaking Switzerland it is still the most important white wine variety today. For a long time this vine variety was thought to be a crossing between Riesling and Silvaner. In 1998 an Austrian research team discovered, on the basis of molecular-genetic tests, that the crossing partners were not Riesling x Silvaner, but Riesling x Madeleine Royal. How this ¬´mix-up¬ª could have occurred has never been discovered. However, this fact has given new impetus to the vine variety's second name, M√ºller-Thurgau. Albert Volkart (1873‚Äì1951) *First Director of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon *The great pioneer of Swiss agriculture , was born in 1873 in Zurich. In 1891 he began his studies at the agricultural department of the Polytechnic in Zurich. After the final examination in 1894, he joined as an assistant to Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler in this institution, where he was later an assistant and management board, where he worked for 35 years. Volkart dealt extensively with issues of plant protection. In 1917, Volkart replaced the retired CEO of Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler seeds Investigation and Research, and three years later, he became head of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon. In 1925 he became professor of Agronomy at the ETH.Lehmann, Josef 2003:48-49 Friedrich Traugott Wahlen (1899‚Äì1985) *Director of the Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich-Oerlikon Friedrich Traugott Wahlen was born in 1899 in Gmeis Mirchel in the Emmental. As a small child he wanted to be a farmer. In 1917 he began his study of agriculture at the Polytechnic in Zurich. He acted in several roles: **1929-1943: Executive Board of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon **1938-1945: Member in the Federal War Food Office **1942-1949: Council of the Canton of Zurich **1943-1949: Professor of Agronomy at the agricultural department of the ETH In 1949 he was appointed to the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), first to Washington and then in 1951, to Rome, where he presided as director of the Department of Agriculture from 1950 to 1952 and was chief of the technical assistance program. In 1958 he was appointed Deputy Director-General of the FAO. On 11 December 1958, the Federal Assembly elected him to the Federal Council, where he first was the Minister of Justice and Police, later he led the Ministry of the Department of Economic and then was the Foreign Minister by the Political Department. Until the 1965 elections he was a Federal Council.Lehmann, Josef 2003:62-63 Rudolf Koblet (1904‚Äì1983) *Executive Board of the Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich-Oerlikon *A polymath of the agricultural crop On 13 February 1904 was born in Heiterthal, not far from Kollbrunn in T√∂sstal. He attended the Industrial School in Winterthur and in 1923 began with his studies at the Department of Agriculture of the ETH. In 1926 he graduated with a diploma as an engineer-agronomist. After a stay in France he went to Canada where he acquired, besides the work as \\"farm help\\" in various Canadian farms, specialized knowledge, as a volunteer in the Seed Branch in Ottawa, in the field of control seeds. In 1929 he joined the line for seed control in Oerlikon. With his work \\"On the germination Pinus strobus with particular reference to the origin of the seed,\\" he earned his doctorate in 1932 Dr.sc.techn. ETH. In 1949 he became head of the Department of Agronomy at the ETH.Lehmann, Josef 2003:80-81 Rudolf Salzmann (1912‚Äì1992) *Director of the Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Station for Agronomy Zurich- Reckenholz *Planner and builder of the Research Institute Reckenholz was born on 2 January 1912 in Bern. In the years 1930 to 1933, he completed his agriculture studies at the ETH. He oversaw the procurement of seed in the war food office under Frederick Traugott elections and then took a slightly later point in agricultural chemistry from the Swiss Federal Institute Liebefeld, where he worked on the agronomic aspects and problems of the institution. In 1944, he was transferred to the agricultural experimental station Oerlikon. His election as successor to Director Koblet took place on November 1, 195, when he took responsibility for both academic work and for the organizational and administrative issues.Lehmann, Josef 2003:98-99  Notes and references   Bibliography  * Popp, Hans (2001): Entstehung und Entwicklung der landwirtschaftlichen Forschungsanstalten, Bern * Sieber, Robert; R√ºegg, Max (2002): 100 Jahre Eidgen√∂ssische Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Milchwirtschaft.

Background  Turkic Khaganate was a vast khaganate (empire); from Manchuria and Chinese wall to Black sea.Jean Paul Roux: T√ºrklerin Tarihi (Historie des Turcs), tr:Prof Dr Aykut Kazancƒ±gil, Lale Arslan √ñzcan, Kabalcƒ± yayƒ±nevi, ƒ∞stanbul, 2007, p 101. It was impossible to govern the whole khaganate from a certain capital. So while the eastern part was directly ruled by the khagan (emperor), the western part was governed by yabgu (vassal) in behalf of the khagan. The capital of the west was Ordukent (Suyab) (present day Kyrgyzstan). Istemi who was the khagan's brother was the first and Tardu (ƒ∞stemi's son) was the second yabgu.  Years of civil war  Tardu became the yabgu in c. 575. In that year he met the Byzantine ambassador Valentinius. Being a very ambitious yabgu he was planning to seize power in whole khaganate. He saw his chance in 581 when khagan Taspar died. Taspar had announced his preference for Talopien (son of Mukan Khagan) instead of his son Anluo. But G√∂kt√ºrk kurultay (council of tribal leaders) which was authorized to appoint the new khagan refused the former kagan's will and appointed the former khagan's son who in turn acknowledged Ishbara Qaghan as the new khagan. This gave Tardu the necessary cause to interfere. He sent an army to back Talopien. Ishbara applied Sui China for protection and both contestants were played off against each other by China.  Later years  While the east part of the khaganate suffered from civil war, Tardu was waiting for a suitable moment to realize his plans. After the Battle of Blarathon in 591 in Sassanid Persia, Bahram Chobin who was a short term Sasanid empreror, sought asylum in Western Turks.A page about Hormozd IV In 599 Tardu declared himself to be khagan of the united khaganate (east and west)Melek Tekin: T√ºrk tarihi, p. 87, Milliyet yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1991 But his new status was not recognised widely. Probably to persuade the kurultay, he began a campaign against China. But unlike Turks of eastern part his target of campaign was too far away and his army suffered intensely from the poisoned waterwells during the long expedition through the steppe. Finally, he had to retreat without serious combats. But this defeat was disastrous for him. After a rebellion of his subjects, he disappeared from the scene (probably was killed) in 603 or 604. He was succeeded in west by Niri Qaghan, a son of Talopien.  Family  He was father to Tulu (ÈÉΩÂÖ≠) and K√ºl√ºg Sibir. Sheguy and Tong Yabghu were his grandsons through Tulu.

Magalotti was born in Rome into an aristocratic family, the son of Ottavio Magalotti, Prefect of the Pontifical Mail: his uncle Lorenzo Magalotti was a member of the Roman Curia. His cousin Filippo was rector at University of Pisa. The Jesuit Magalotti became the secretary of the Accademia del cimento and a gazetteer of the sciences.Conchrane, E. (1973) Florence in the Forgotten Centuries 1527‚Äì1800, p. 255. Magalotti started off as one of the most ardent followers of Galileo GalileiConchrane, E. (1973), p. 237. but was increasingly distressed by the personal rivalries among the individual members, which constantly undermined the academy's dedication to collective research. Gradually, Magalotti lost interest in science.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 246. He became a traveller, an ambassador, and ended up as a poet. He translated Paradise Lost by John Milton, and Cyder by John Philips into Italian. Life Magalotti received four years of education at the Collegio Romano and three years at the University of Pisa. He studied law and medicine, but changed to mathematics under Vincenzo Viviani.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 231. On 19 June 1657 the Cimento was founded by a group of philosophers and amateurs, pupils of Galilei, who saw observation as their task.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 240. They studied the works of Plato, Democritus, Aristotle, Heinsius, Robert Boyle and Pierre Gassendi. The astronomers of the Cimento succeeded in providing the first sustained confirmation of Christiaan Huygens's discoveries: Saturn's rings. The rings of Saturn (imaged here by Cassini in 2007) are the most conspicuous in the Solar System. On 20 May 1660, Lorenzo Magalotti had replaced Segni, and a few years later he wrote the only publication of the academy, the Saggi di naturali Esperienze (\\"Essays on Natural Experiments\\"). Alessandro Marchetti, Marcello Malpighi, an anatomist, and Antonio Vallisneri, a physician, Vincenzo da Filicaja, Benedetto Menzini, both poets, Francesco Redi, a \\"microbiologist\\", Viviani, Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, a physicist, and Carlo Renaldini, an astronomer regularly attended its meetings. These were usually held in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. Members performed numerous experiments, in the fields of thermometry, barometry, pneumatics, the velocity of sound and light, phosphorescence, magnetism, amber and other electrical bodies, the freezing of water, etc. Medicine was, without doubt, the talked- about subject of the day.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 251. The young Danish anatomist Niels Stensen, better known as Steno, arrived from Copenhagen by way of Leiden and Paris early in 1666. The Norman astronomer Adrien Auzout, inventor of a device for measuring planetary diameters, arrived in 1668, fresh from a quarrel with Jean-Baptiste Colbert and armed with a letter from Magalotti, who by then had become Leopoldo's main talent scout abroad.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 248. Comet Hale-Bopp, as seen on 29 March 1997 in Pazin, Croatia Magalotti knew as well as anyone that a scientifically valid explanation of the comet of 1664 could have made an important contribution to an explanation of the whole solar system. But instead of attempting one, he amused himself with the obviously ridiculous thesis that the tail of the comet was an optical illusion. As soon as he saw Cassini's much more penetrating and much better-informed explanation, he admitted that he cared no more for comets than for rainbows. As early as 1664 he had been appointed to the commission charged with supervising the decoration of Palazzo Pitti and from then on, until his death he made a point of getting to know all the practising artists of the city. In 1667 Magalotti had made a pilgrimage to the blessed bones of the divine poet at Ravenna. Magalotti had met Sir John Finch and Henry Neville, he had improved his English and with his boyhood friend Paolo Falconieri, an architect, he made plans to visit Northern Europe. Travelling to the Netherlands The two companions left in mid-July, crossed the Alps, and arrived in Augsburg in August. By mid-October they were wandering around in the Hague and visited Heinsius, Isaac Vossius, and Jacob Gronovius. On 12 November 1667 Magalotti arrived in Utrecht to visit Johann Georg Graevius. In the meantime Cosimo III de' Medici went on his grand tour. The Grand Duke travelled in a group of 18 people and 14 carriages, accompanied by six cooks and his secretary Appolonio Bassetti. On 28 October 1667, they had arrived in Tyrol, travelled to Mainz to visit the prince-elector, and set direction down the Rhine. On 19 December they arrived in Amsterdam. On his first day he saw the Admiralty of Amsterdam and the warehouses and wharves of the Dutch East India Company. Cosimo planned to start an East India Company from Livorno. The duke took his lodgings in a house at Keizersgracht, keen on keeping a private life, living with the Tuscan merchant and slave-trader Francisco Ferroni. While it is difficult to make out who went where with whom, and supposedly, the somewhat shy, pious, and taciturn Cosimo never went somewhere without company, an excerpt of the diary of Cosimo's visits is following here. A patron of the arts, Cosimo visited fifteen painters over a four-month period:Rembrandt: the painter at work by Ernst van de Wetering the Leiden painters Gerard Dou and Frans van Mieris the Elder; Ludolf Bakhuizen, Willem van de Velde the Elder, Jan van Kessel, Nicolaes Maes, and Gabriel Metsu. From Caspar Netscher he bought four paintings.Liedtke, W. (2007) Dutch Painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 512, 518.The cook and the lacemaker by Netscher can still be seen in the Uffizi. The duke preferenced small paintings, obviously easier to pack. Around Christmas, he visited some hidden churches and social institutions. (A popular sight to visit was the madhouse on Kloveniersburgwal.) He met with the Jansenist Johannes van Neercassel. On 30 December 1667 Cosimo went to the Schouwburg of Van Campen, a copy of the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza. He probably saw \\"Medea\\" by Jan Vos. They did not understand a word, but it had been attractive to watch. The pit was almost empty, while no others were invited. On 12 January, he attended the prince William III of Orange, who was only 17 at that time and performed in the ballet on that evening. Johan de Witt saved Cosimo from a boring conversation with some Amsterdam burgomasters and introduced him to some nice looking young ladies. Cosimo met John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, who had spent a long time in Dutch Brazil. In the 17th century, many visitors came to Holland to see collections of paintings or rarities. The duke paid a visit to Gerrit van Uylenburgh, who owned part of the collection by Gerard Reynst. Dutch scientists and collectioners Franciscus Sylvius, Frederik Ruysch, Jan SwammerdamIsrael, J. (1995) The Dutch Republic, Its Rise Greatness, and Fall 1477‚Äì1806. Clarendon Press Oxford, p. 877. and probably Theodor Kerckring and Nicolaes Witsen showed them their cabinet of curiosities. At Swammerdam, who studied all kinds of insects, and knew almost everything about bees, Cosimo was accompanied by Melchis√©dech Th√©venot. Illustration from Steno's 1667 paper comparing the teeth of a shark head with a fossil tooth Cosimo, who was informed by the geologist and anatomist Niels Stensen, one of the exponents of the Counter Reformation, refused to meet to philosopher Baruch Spinoza, living in Rijnsburg, when Cosimo visited some painters, and the Hortus Botanicus Leiden.Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650‚Äì1750 by Jonathan Irvine Israel He bought a painting by Jan van der Heyden, which has a strange perspective, but Van der Heyden delivered a tool to see the oval bell-tower from the right angle and in a more natural and round shape.View on the town hall of Amsterdam On the last day of his stay in Amsterdam he ordered a self-portrait from Rembrandt.Selfportrait of Rembrandt in the Uffizi He visited Plantin House in Antwerp,DBNL then they went to Mechelen, Brussels to order some tapestries and went back to the Dutch Republic. Around Ash- Wednesday, Cosimo peregrinated via Bentheim to Hamburg. While the inns were less abundant, Cosimo spent the night in a farmhouse, where they could \\"conversate with the cows\\" in the stable. The travelling became harder because of all the marshes and mud. Magalotti did not go along and went to London. Travelling in England He was shocked to see how much money the English spent on cock fights and how much mess was still leftover from the Great Fire of London. Bernardo Guasconi provided them with an invitation to the weekly meetings of the Royal Society. A lecture-demonstration by Robert Hooke, as well as a warm reception by the secretary, Henry Oldenburg, quickly overcame their initial disappointment in finding the society somewhat less formally organised than they had expected. Magalotti was greatly disillusioned about his reception by the King. The two men made a seven-day trip to Windsor, Hampton Court, and Oxford where they visited Robert Boyle. When Magalotti became ill Boyle visited him and sat by his bedside for two or three hours daily.Borderlines or Interfaces in the Life and Work of Robert Boyle (1627‚Äì1691): The authorship of Protestant and Papist revisited by D. Thorburn Burns One of the main purposes of the trip had been fully realised. Receiving courtesies from wise and learned men is ample recompense for all the trouble and money spent on travelling. And a score of prominent scholars and one real king was not a bad record for a thirty-year-old tourist of as yet no particular accomplishment. They ended up, toward the end of April, in Paris.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 257. He met Henri Louis Habert de Montmor, founder of a famous scientific salon, Jean Chapelain, a specialist on Italian literature, Valentin Conrart, and Ismael Bouillau, his scientific correspondent.Conchrane, E.

Travelling to Spain and Portugal Marguerite d'Orleans Because Cosimo's wife, the beautiful, vivacious, headstrong and thoroughly spoiled Marguerite Louise d'Orl√©ans was as intractable as ever, he headed on 18 September, from Livorno for another journey to Spain. Magalotti, as a member of the retinue of 27 men, was given the job of keeping a diary.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 261. Magalotti promised to send catalogues and books to Antonio Magliabechi, a dirty librarian, who did not care about his looks. From Barcelona they travelled to Madrid where he spent a month; It is supposed the 8-year-old Carlos II, by then hardly able to speak and walk, received him in a private interview.Acton, p 103 Then they went to C√≥rdoba, Seville and Granada, followed by Talavera la Real and Badajoz. Magalotti found Spain to be bankrupt and demoralised, proud and lavish. Its learning hopelessly out of touch with the rest of Europe; its religion consisted largely of elaborate processions, gaudy reliquaries, and fables. None of the professors at the University of Alcal√° could speak more than three words of Latin.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 262-263. By January, he had arrived in Lisbon via Set√∫bal. While Lorenzo Magalotti limits himself to offering us a general view, Filippo Corsini describes in detail the Portuguese defensive system, keeping in mind even the names of some military men who distinguished themselves in the Portuguese Restoration War. In general the Prince preferred to lodge in religious institutions and frequently chatted with the priests. It was the Monastery of Saint Denis of Odivelas that most aroused the curiosity of the Florentines. The Prince and his court left the Portuguese territory from Caminha on 1 March, travelling on a ship that would take them to Galicia, Spain. Travelling to England and the Netherlands From La Coru≈àa they set off for England. Because of an uncomfortable storm they arrived in Kinsale and then headed to Plymouth. Cosimo spent three months in London where Charles II received him. Samuel Pepys described him as \\"a very jolly and good comely man\\".Acton, p 104 Cosimo was amiably welcomed by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and at Billingbear House.Count L. Magalotti, Travels of Cosmo the Third, Grand Duke of Tuscany, through England during the Reign of King Charles the Second 1669, (J. Mawman, London, 1821), p.277. When Billingbear House was visited by the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1669, Magalotti painted a view of the house during the two-day stay,Billingbear Park, Waltham St. Lawrence, Berkshire\\", from website David Nash Ford's \\"Royal Berkshire History\\" (Accessed 13 September 2007). which is one of various images to be found in an illustrated manuscript in the Laurentian Library, Florence.Drawings from the diary Count Magalotti visited Exeter, and wrote of over thirty thousand people being employed in the county of Devon as part of the wool and cloth industries, merchandise that was sold to \\"the West Indies, Spain, France and Italy\\".Gray 2000, Exeter: The Traveller's Tales. p.18 They met the miniaturist Samuel Cooper, who painted Cosimo,Royal Collection and John Michael Wright.

In England he made a number of good friends, including Isaac Newton; among the over one hundred distinguished persons who came to call on him was Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, who became his correspondent. Samuel Morland sent him a calculating machine and his loudspeaker. Cosimo became a dedicated Anglophile.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 262. On 14 June 1669, they left England and travelled to Rotterdam. He met Coenraad van Beuningen and the liberal Charles de Saint-Evremond, whose essays and poetry Magalotti was to study so attentively in later years. Cosimo picked up a few painting he had ordered. Actually, he saw Rembrandt a few months before the painter died. Then they went to Haarlem, Alkmaar, Hoorn, Enkhuizen and Molkwar, a small village, built on eight islands, connected with 27 bridges. One day they visited Delft to see some good paintings and met with the widow and nobly three daughters of Maarten Tromp.Vermeer and the Delft School by Walter A. Liedtke, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.) (Tromp married in 1640 Cornelia van Teding Berkhout, his third wife; she died in Delft in 1680.) Via Nijmegen, Aix-la-Chapelle and Spa they moved south. Cosimo visited Louis XIV, and Marguerite of Lorraine his mother-in-law, in Paris. Via Lyon and Marseille he arrived in Florence on 1 November 1669.Acton, p 105 In his writing travelogs Magalotti was inspired by Jacob Spon and Jean Chardin.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 264. He renounced the career of those who toured the world [just] to copy epitaphs and count the steps in bell towers.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 268. Ambassador in Vienna After 1670, Florentine science changed somewhat in character. Magalotti was unsure whether many of Cosimo's projects were worth the huge sums spent by the Grand Duke. For instance, Cosimo aspired to convert England, northern Germany and India to Catholicism, batter the Ottoman Empire by land and by sea, and establish permanent commercial relations with Persia.Conchrane, E. (1973), p. 269. Magalotti continued his travels without the Grand Duke. Swedish sauna illustration from Magalotti's diary He visited Brussels, Cologne, the United Provinces, Hamburg, Copenhagen and Stockholm in 1673/1674 as a Tuscan ambassador to the Imperial court of the Holy Roman Empire in Vienna. He described in his book Sweden in the year 1674 Charles XI of Sweden as \\"virtually afraid of everything, uneasy to talk to foreigners, and not daring to look anyone in the face\\". Other traits was a deep religious devotion: he was God-fearing, frequently prayed kneeling and attended sermons. Magalotti otherwise described the king's main pursuits as hunting, the upcoming war, and jokes. In May 1678 he went home. In 1680 his brother found him a rich widow in Naples, but he told the negotiators he had become impotent. Magalotti decided that he was better suited for some sort of intellectual activity. In 1709 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He died in Florence in 1712.

Evidence for her actual historical existence or acta is very sparse. She is called a martyr of the Diocletianic Persecution, although her death occurred after the resignation of Diocletian himself. She should not be confused with another 4th-century saint, Dorothea of Alexandria. She and Theophilus are mentioned in the Roman Martyrology as martyrs of Caesarea in Cappadocia, with a feast day on 6 February.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ) She is thus officially recognized as a saint, but because there is scarcely any non- legendary knowledge about her, she is no longer (since 1969) included in the General Roman Calendar. Life Santa Dorotea by Zurbaran The earliest record that mentions Dorothea is found in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum. This first record contains only three basic facts: the day of martyrdom, the place where it occurred, and her name and that of Theophilus.Joseph Martin Peterson, The Dorothea Legend: Its Earliest Records, Middle English Versions, and Influence of Massinger‚Äôs \\"Virgin Martyr\\" (University of Heidelberg, 1910), 13. Legend Virgin and martyr, Dorothea of Caesarea suffered during the persecution of Diocletian, 6 February, 311, at Caesarea in Cappadocia. She was brought before the prefect Sapricius, tried, tortured, and sentenced to death. On her way to the place of execution the pagan lawyer Theophilus said to her in mockery: \\"Bride of Christ, send me some fruits from your bridegroom's garden.\\" Before she was executed, she sent him, by a six-year-old boy, her headdress which was found to be filled with a heavenly fragrance of roses and fruits. Theophilus at once confessed himself a Christian, was put on the rack, and suffered death. This is the oldest version of the legend, which was later variously enlarged.Meier, Gabriel. \\"St. Dorothea.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 13 Mar. 2015 (The boy with the basket can be seen in the depictions by Josse van der Baren and Hans Baldung Grien in the gallery below). The oldest known version of the legend is Aldhelm's De laudibus virginitatis, addressed to Abbess Hildelitha of Barking Abbey, Essex. Kirsten Wolf characterizes it as one of several legends invented in the fourth and fifth centuries to provide a story to go with a name on one of the various liturgical calendars.Wolf, Kirsten. De Sancta Dorothea, PIMS, 1997 Veneration In the West she has been venerated since the seventh century. Dorothy's cult became widespread in Europe during the Middle Ages.Santa Dorotea e Teofilo In late medieval Sweden she was considered as the 15th member of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, and in art she occurred with Saint Barbara, Catherine of Alexandria and Margaret of Antioch, forming with them a quartet of female saints called de fyra huvudjungfrurna or in Latin, \\"Quattor Virgines Capitales\\" meaning \\"The four Capital Virgins\\" Patronage She is regarded as the patroness of gardeners. On her feast (February 6) trees are blessed in some places. She is also patroness of brewers, brides, florists, midwives, newlyweds and Pescia, Italy Iconography Dorothea is represented with an angel and a wreath of flowers. She is often depicted as a maiden carrying a basket of fruit and flowers, especially roses; also depicted wearing a crown of flowers (such as roses); depicted surrounded by stars as she kneels before the executioner; crowned with palm and flower basket, surrounded by stars; depicted in an orchard with the Christ-child in an apple tree; leading the Christ-child by the hand; veiled with flowers in her lap; depicted holding apples from heaven on a branchPatron Saints Index: Saint Dorothy of Caesarea Legacy The Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Dorothy is a convent of active nuns, occupied primarily with teaching and the cultivation of flowers and produce. The order is named for Dorothea of Caesarea. Dorothy of Caesarea's life and martyrdom was the basis of Philip Massinger and Thomas Dekker's The Virgin Martyr (printed 1622).

A member of the Religious Teachers Filippini for most of her life, she had access to the sisters of her order in Italy, who reportedly sheltered some Jews during the Second World War. Life Marchione was born February 19, 1922 in Little Ferry, New Jersey, one of eight children of Crescenzo and Felicia Marchione, immigrants from Campania, Italy. She attended St. Mary's School in nearby Hackensack, and in 1935 she joined the Religious Teachers Filippini. Marchione received her B.A. from Georgian Court College, and her M.A. and PhD from Columbia University, and eventually became a professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University, after earning a doctorate on philosophy at Columbia. She occupied the post of emeritus professor of Italian language and literature at Fairleigh Dickinson. On Philip Mazzei Marchione's interest in Philip Mazzei began in 1974 bicentennial. Philip Mazzei, was an 18th-century Florentine who moved to Virginia, fought in the American Revolution, and became a lifelong personal friend of Thomas Jefferson. The author of seven volumes on Mazzei, Marchione donated approximately 2,500 printed and published artifacts, works of art and decorative objects of Philip Mazzei to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Foundation librarian Jack Robertson stated, \\"The collection compiled by Sister Margherita includes not only facsimiles of all of Mazzei's correspondence, but relatively obscure publications on the role of Italians in American history.\\" She launched an ultimately successful campaign to get the United States Postal Service (USPS) to designate a stamp to commemorate Mazzei in the form of a 40 cent airmail stamp in 1980 to commemorate Mazzei's 250th birthday. Pius XII Sister Marchione claims pressure from the international Jewish community is a major contributing factor to the Vatican's failure to beatify Pius XII. She has launched numerous appeals to Yad Vashem to change its present unflattering characterization of Pius XII and declare the wartime pope a \\"Righteous Gentile\\". She objects to a statement concerning Pius XII that is printed below a photo of him at Yad Vashem, which reads, in part: > Pius XII's reaction toward the killing of Jews during the period of the > Holocaust is controversial. Although reports about the assassination of Jews > reached the Vatican, the pope did not protest either by speaking out or in > writing. In December of 1942, he did not participate in the condemnation by > members of the Allies regarding the killing of Jews. Even when the Jews were > being deported from Rome to Auschwitz, the pope did not intervene. He > maintained a neutral position except toward the end of the war when he > appealed on behalf of the government of Hungary and of Slovakia. His silence > and absence of directives obliged the clergy in Europe to decide > independently how they should behave toward the persecuted Jews. Yad Vashem's Righteous Gentiles Department informed Marchione that the museum would consider changing the negative presentation of Pius' role during the Holocaust if at least two Jews (or their descendants) were to come forward with proof they were saved from the Nazis due to Pius' personal intervention. Marchione claims she has interviewed scores of elderly Italian Jews who expressed gratitude to the pope for the fact that they were hidden in Vatican institutions during that period. After Pope Benedict XVI's first major meeting with Jewish leaders in 2005, Rabbi David Rosen, director of interreligious affairs for the American Jewish Committee, told the Catholic News Service that \\"there would be very many [people] within the Jewish world who would see the beatification of Pius XII as an act of intentional insensitivity\\". Marchione has stated: > If Jewish leaders say today that Pius XII did nothing to save Jews, they are > disputing the testimony of other Jews who said he did quite a lot ... It is > terribly unfair to put so much blame on Pius, who had no army besides a few > Swiss Guards with which to resist Hitler, while leaders like Franklin > Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, who had the means to bomb the concentration > camps, failed to do so She was an honoree at a National Italian American Foundation dinner attended by President Ronald Reagan. Her work has been criticized by the Rev. John Morley, a professor of Jewish studies at Seton Hall University, and Father John Pawlikowski of Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. Rev. Morley wrote a doctoral dissertation on Vatican diplomacy during the Holocaust, which was highly critical of Pius XII. Fr. Pawlikowski has urged Catholics and others to confront the long history of Christian anti-Semitism. Pawlikowski said he gives Marchione \\"very little credibility. She never gets invited to scholarly conferences on the Holocaust\\". Another critic of Marchione is Susan Zuccotti, author of Under His Very Windows (2002), a study of the Holocaust in Italy. The book is highly critical of what Zuccotti portrays as Pius' failure to take effective action to save the Jews. \\"There is absolutely no written or oral record of a papal order or instruction of any kind to help the Jews\\", Zuccotti told New Jersey Jewish News. > Of course, I believe deeply in the righteousness of Pope Pius, but if you > were to prove to me that Pius XII did something wrong, I would be the first > to acknowledge it. Yet I haven't found anything so far to indicate that ... > I know I won't be around forever, but I very much hope to live long enough > to witness the beatification of Pius XII. Until then, I will do what I can > to bring that day closer by exposing the falsity of the attacks on this > great and good man. Activism In the mid-1990s, she learned that her own order, the Religious Teachers Filippini, had sheltered 114 Jews from 1943-44 at their convent in Rome. She then wrote a book, Yours Is a Precious Witness, which was published in 1997 by the Paulist Press. The book included extensive interviews with Italian Jews who expressed gratitude for having been hidden by convents and monasteries during the Nazi occupation of Rome. She continued to write more books on the same theme, including Pope Pius XII, Architect for Peace (2000) and Consensus and Controversy, Defending Pope Pius XII (2002). Marchione contends it is inconceivable that the heads of so many convents and monasteries would have sheltered Jews unless they were acting at the pope's direction, citing a comment by Father David Maria Jaeger, an Israeli-born Jewish convert to Roman Catholicism and a prelate auditor of the Roman Rota, who argued: \\"Anyone who has any acquaintance with the law and culture of the Catholic Church at that time would understand [that] those things could not have taken place without specific orders of the pope, and those orders could not have been in written form.\\" Defenders Marchione's defenders include: * Dr. Eugene Fisher, associate director of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. * Gary Krupp, president of the New York-based Pave the Way Foundation, said he believes Jewish groups should drop their opposition to the beatification of Pius to buttress a Jewish-Vatican alliance in the face of the rise of radical Islam. According to Krupp, \\"Margherita Marchione has done important research on Pius' efforts on behalf of the Jews during the Holocaust and is highly respected within the church for her accomplishments. More people should listen to what she is saying.\\" Health On August 19, 2011, it was revealed that the 90-year-old Marchione was treated surgically for intestinal cancer.

It usually has a prostrate to procumbent habit, though some forms may have an erect habit, growing up to 1.3 metres high. The leaves are ovate to rounded, 2 to 5 mm long and have a short petiole. Flowers are produced between October and November in its native range. These have dark- coloured standards, yellow and orange wings and purplish keels. The seed pods are narrow-oblong in shape and around 20 mm long. The species was first formally described by Allan Cunningham who found it growing \\"upon rocky, brushy hills\\" in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.

An address constant can be one, two, three or four bytes long, although an adcon of less than four bytes is conventionally used to hold an expression for a small integer such as a length, a relative address, or an index value, and does not represent an address at all. Address constants are defined using an assembler language \\"DC\\" statement. Other computer systems have similar facilities, although different names may be used. Types of address constants A adcons normally store a four byte relocatable address, however it is possible to specify the length of the constant. For example, \`AL1(stuff)\` defines a one-byte adcon, useful mainly for small constants with relocatable values. Other adcon types can similarly have length specification. V type adcons store an external reference to be resolved by the link-editor. Y is used for two byte (halfword) addresses. 'Y' adcons can directly address up to 32K bytes of storage, and are not widely used since early System/360 assemblers did not support a 'Y' data type. Early DOS/360 and BOS/360 systems made more use of Y adcons, since the machines these systems ran on had limited storage. The notation 'AL2(value)' is now usually used in preference to 'Y(value)' to define a 16 bit value. Q address constants contain not actual addresses but a displacement in the External Dummy Section ‚Äì similar to the Linux Global Offset Table (see Position- independent code). A J adcon is set by the linkage editor to hold the cumulative length of the External Dummy Section, and does not actually contain an address. Other types of address constants are R which had special significance for TSS/360 to address the PSECT, and S, which stores an address in base-displacement format ‚Äì a 16 bit value containing a four bit general register number and a twelve bit displacement, the same format as addresses are encoded in instructions. System z supports types AD, JD, QD, and VD, which represent 8 byte (doubleword) versions of types 'A', 'J', 'Q', and 'V' to hold 64 bit addresses. Relocatability The nominal value of the 'DC' is a list of expressions enclosed in parentheses. Expressions can be absolute, relocatable, or complex relocatable. An absolute expression can be completely evaluated at assembly time and does not require further processing by the linkage editor. For example, \`DC A(4900796)\` has an absolute nominal value. A relocatable expression is one that contains one or more terms that require relocation by the linkage editor when the program ls linked, for example, in the following code 'ACON' has a relocatable nominal value. LAB DC H'0' ... ACON DC A(LAB-4) A complex relocatable expression contains terms that relate to addresses in different source modules. For example, \`DC A(X-Y)\` where 'X' and 'Y' are in different modules. Examples All these are valid adcon's:- ADCONS DS 0A an aligned label of implicit length 4 and actual length 0 DC A(FIELDA) a 4 byte word, aligned, absolute address of a variable 'FIELDA' DC AL4(FIELDA) as above but not (necessarily) aligned on a word boundary DC AL3(FIELDA) a three byte equivalent of the above (maximum 16 megabytes) DC AL2(FIELDA-TABLES) two byte offset from 'TABLES' label to start of 'FIELDA' DC AL2(L'FIELDA) a two byte length of the field called 'FIELDA' (=26 in decimal) DC AL1(C'A') hexadecimal value of the EBCDIC character 'A' (=C1 in hex) DC A(FIELDA-C'A') a 4 byte, aligned, absolute address --> 192 bytes before the start of FIELDA DC A(*) a 4 byte, aligned, address of this adcon (* means 'here') DC S(SUBRTNA) a 2 byte, aligned base+displacement address of the program label \\"SUBRTNA\\" DC X'47F0',S(SUBRTNA) an unconditional branch instruction (built using an S-type address constant) DC SL2(SUBRTNA) a 2 byte, UNALIGNED base+displacement address of the program label \\"SUBRTNA\\" STAB DC SL2(SUBRTNA,SUBRTNB,SUBRTNC,.etc.) AN ARRAY OF unaligned S-TYPE ADCONS * INDIRECT DC A(*+4) address of next byte after this adcon (the V-type adcon) DC V(SUBRTNX) address of an external subroutine entry point DC AL1(‚àí1) a one byte negative value (= x'FF'), often used as a table de-limiter .

The Group develops the Apparel product stream in lockstep its store network, currently encompassing 900 single-branded stores. History The firm was established at Alba in 1947 by Giuseppe Miroglio, son of Carlo and Angela Miroglio, both of whom ran a drapery business at the turn of the 19th century. The move from trade to industry dates back to when Giuseppe Miroglio decided to venture into the production of silk fabrics and the installation of looms. Vestebene (now Miroglio Fashion) was established in 1955. This division is dedicated to mass-production of fashionable women's clothes. In 1958, the Miroglio Group broadened its sphere of activity by opening a modern dyeing, special cloth finishing and textile-printing plant, thereby completing the fabric-to-garment production chain. Vestebene started moving some of its production away from Italy in the 1970s, initially to Greece and then to other countries, from Tunisia to Egypt, throughout the Mediterranean. At the same time its fabric division diversified into the thread, yarn, and transfer paper industries. Over the course of the next two decades, the group opened new manufacturing operations in Southern Italy, particularly in the Apulia region.Miroglio in Puglia su Corriere del Giorno In 1973, the Fondazione Opera Elena Miroglio (now the Fondazione Elena e Gabriella Miroglio) was established. This has a focus on raising awareness of cultural, welfare, and social issues. Emphasis is placed on activities oriented towards Group employees (healthcare and economic support) and towards their children (nurseries, holiday camps, scholarships) and, not least, towards the group's pensioners, providing them with pleasure trips and other recreations.La Fondazione Miroglio The Elena Mir√≤ brand was launched in 1984 (or 1985, according to its current website). (Since 2005, the brand has been targeted at the more generous sizing womenswear sector.Articolo del Corriere della Sera) By the mid-1980s, the Group was forging a strategic alliance with leading stylists such as Moschino and Krizia. Eventually other brands were born, such as Caract√®re and Diana Gallesi, as well as Motivi in 1993.Carugati-Marsano in bibliografia Another milestone along the route to internationalisation was the Group's entry into the Bulgarian market, accomplished in 2001 through acquisition of a legendary production site at Sliven.L'entrata nel mercato bulgaro In October 2002, the president of the Italian Republic conferred on Carlo Miroglio, chairman of the Miroglio Group, the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Knight Grand Cross), an insignia bestowed on those who, in the course of their life and professional career, have been singularly meritorious with long and conspicuous service in social, commercial and industrial activities.Comunicazione del Quirinale Gaining shape in 2003 were rumours of imminent withdrawal by Miroglio from its spinning manufacturing facilities in Southern Italy, starting with the production site at Castellaneta earmarked for shut down in the Spring 2004. In December 2004, the Miroglio Group seals a joint venture agreement with Elegant Prosper, a Chinese enterprise specialising in mid/upper bracket womenswear. The initial investment enabled the Italian Group to acquire an interest in the jointly controlled Asian entity. The joint venture was primed primarily toward providing a platform for more vibrant brand growth and development. Following in the wake thereof were specific projects, all of which designed toward enhancing awareness of Miroglio's Italian brand names across the Asian marketplace.Miroglia in Cina , Stile.it At end of 2006, the Miroglio Group oversaw one thousand stores flying the Miroglio banner.Comunicato sul sito ufficiale During 2007, on occasion of the International Women's Day, the insignia of Cavaliere della Repubblica (Order of Merit of the Italian Republic) was awarded to Elena Miroglio. The insignia was bestowed by virtue of the contribution made by the Elena Mir√≤ brand and by the Group toward \\"emancipating women from a constrictive concept of beauty\\", as declared during the award ceremony by Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Italian Republic.Articolo di Repubblica In June 2008, the Miroglio Group acquired a stake in the Ayaydin Group, a sector leading competitor, specialising in womenswear fashion, across the Turkish marketplace. As agreed by contract, the Miroglio Group works toward building up the market footprint forged by the Ayaydin Group across the homeland and across emerging markets (such as Russia, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, and Moldavia). The contract contemplates an important five-year investment plan.Comunicazione sul sito ufficiale Shut down at end 2008 was one other spinning production site managed and operated by the Group at Ginosa in Apulia, becoming the subject of parliamentary questions and debate.Interrogazione parlamentare del 24/09/08Risposta all'interrogazione del 23/04/09 In September 2009, the Motivi brand had 500 single-branded stores: 340 stores in Italy and 160 stores abroad.

It is about Giuseppe Verdi, and the pressure put upon him after his attempt to retire from composing. Continued insistent prodding from his friends eventually results in one of his greatest masterpieces, the opera Otello, which premiered in 1887. Background and inception Brian McMaster, managing director of the Welsh National Opera, commissioned the play, originally as a vehicle for the company's touring season to far-flung Welsh towns with smaller theatres than the average opera house. McMaster initially asked Julian Mitchell, author of the hit play-turned-film Another Country, to write about the backstage life of an opera company. Mitchell, although he had been an opera fan in his youth, knew little about this milieu when he began working on the project. In the course of his extensive research, however, Mitchell happened on \\"Boito and Verdi\\", the final chapter in Frank Walker's biography The Man Verdi.Walker, Frank. The Man Verdi. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982 (paperback edition). pp. 447‚Äì510. This was a dramatic situation that immediately appealed to him ‚Äì \\"a great artist going through a crisis, brought back to composition after a long silence, and finding himself a substitute prodigal son in the process\\" ‚Äì and he took it as his subject matter.Mitchell, Julian. After Aida. Amber Lane Press, 1986. pp. 5‚Äì9. To familiarize himself with backstage and off-stage opera life, Mitchell took singing lessons, attended opera rehearsals and auditions, and talked to conductors, singers, directors, r√©p√©titeurs, and designers. Mitchell said he found that the restrictions placed on the piece‚Äîsmall stage, single set, and only a few actors‚Äîactually became liberating, and helped him create a well- crafted and artistically sound play. Synopsis The two-act play spans the years from 1879 to 1887, and centers around the composer Verdi and his life and works after he has retired from composing and moved to his country estate. Verdi's two friends, Giulio Ricordi the publisher and Franco Faccio the conductor, convinced that Verdi should write another opera, try to persuade him to come out of retirement and collaborate with the young librettist Arrigo Boito on a new work. One likely subject for a new opera is the play Othello, since Shakespeare is one of Verdi's favourite authors. Verdi's wife Giuseppina Strepponi, tired of seeing him moping about, also assists in the attempt to get Verdi composing again. The play focuses on this major turning point in Verdi's creative life, and combines it with a selection of opera excerpts, drama, and humor. The production is punctuated with full arias and vocal ensembles from Aida, Rigoletto, Ernani, the Requiem, Macbeth, Simon Boccanegra, and Otello. Also included are arias from Boito's Mefistofele and Rossini's Otello. Original productions After Aida opened on 24 October 1985 in Swansea, Wales, at the Taliesin Theatre. As planned, the production then toured to 11 other towns and cities throughout Wales. The production starred Richard Griffiths (Verdi) and Ian Charleson (Boito), with a supporting cast that included four singers from the Welsh National Opera. It was directed by Howard Davies, and the music director was Martin Andre. The show was produced by Robert Fox with Ed and David Mirvish. After Aida received its London premiere at the Old Vic theatre, opening on 11 March 1986. Giuseppina Strepponi was played by Gemma Jones, and the other cast members remained the same, except for a new cast of WNO singers.

Its theologians consider sin the root source of poverty, the sin in question being exploitative capitalism and class war by the rich against the poor.

This meant making their lives uncomfortable, and was based on the supposed northern stunt of ferret-legging (where contestants compete to show who can endure a live ferret within their sealed trousers the longest).

Bright also had a service branch called eSolutions that focused on speeding up the process of car electrification with consulting and conversions. Bright's last CEO, Reuben Munger, stated in early press releases that he wished to see the IDEA in production by 2013. In 2012, after waiting over 3 years for a final response from the Department of Energy on their application for a loan through the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, Bright could no longer sustain itself and announced they would cease all operations.  History  Bright IDEA plug-in hybrid delivery truck exhibited at the 2010 Washington Auto Show. Bright Automotive was started in 2008 as the offspring of the non-profit Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) under the leadership of John E. Waters, who became founding CEO of Bright Automotive. Waters spent years at General Motors and was the inventor of the battery pack used in their first electric vehicle, the GM EV1, in the mid-1990s.LaMonica, Martin. \\"Bright Automotive to enter electric-car derby Green Tech - CNET News.\\" Technology News - CNET News. http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10165562-54.html (accessed January 28, 2011). Under Waters' leadership, and by the end of 2008, Bright had acquired $17 million of initial funding with plans to obtain a $450 million loan from the US Department of Energy (DOE) $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan program. In addition, Waters created a consulting and conversion entity within Bright known as eSolutions and recruited leadership from Mercedes-Benz to lead the effort (Nigel Francis). eSolutions was successful in acquiring a $4 million US Department of Defense (DOD) initiative to design, build, and deliver a plug-in hybrid electric commercial vehicle (PHEV) for off-grid electric generation (i.e., vehicle-to-grid). This successful vehicle program was based on the identical \\"road-coupled hybrid\\" (RCH) powertrain of the Bright IDEA. Due to US DOE stipulations specifically to Bright for the ATVM loan program, in January 2010, Waters et al. led a global effort to align with a major automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to receive the DOE funding. In August 2010, notably, a new branch of General Motors called General Motors Ventures, LLC invested $5 million in Bright Automotive as its first investment in the innovative transportation technology realm. This investment by General Motors Ventures, LLC provided both funds and recognition from the US DOE. Bright spent over 3 years applying, negotiating, and finalizing a loan from the US DOE under their $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. On February 28, 2012 new CEO Reuben Munger announced the company failed to receive a federal retooling loan and their portion of the $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program. The company closed operations over the following few days.\\"Bright Automotive closes up shop after failing to get fed loan money\\" - The Detroit News (accessed February 29, 2012)  Cars   The IDEA  The Bright Automotive IDEA was a plug-in hybrid light cargo vehicle that was designed to get approximately for customers who drive per day. It used pure electric (rear) propulsion for the first of a trip and then changes over to hybrid mode with a 4-cylinder, front wheel drive, 2-liter internal combustion engine.\\"A Bright Idea For Plug-In Hybrids - Forbes.com.\\" Information for the World's Business Leaders - Forbes.com. https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/20/bright-automotive-business-autos-bright.html (accessed January 30, 2011).

Lauzun. \\"Development of the 100 MPG Bright Automotive‚Ñ¢ Plug- In Hybrid Vehicle.\\" Electric Vehicle Symposium 24 (2009). (accessed February 3, 2011). One of Bright's main goals in designing the IDEA was to keep the size and the cost of the battery low. This was accomplished by starting the design process from a clean sheet of paper. Working with Alcoa, Bright used aluminum for the chassis, which is significantly lighter than the customary steel used in other cars. Also, Bright created an aerodynamic body (0.30 Cd, US Patent No. US D613,204 S) and used low rolling resistance tires to increase efficiency. All these factors led to a car that was light and efficient (up to 10 times more efficient than existing commercial vans), leading to the use of a smaller battery. The IDEA was designed as a fleet vehicle for corporations and governments with fuel efficiency and cost-savings in mind (i.e., \\"return on investment\\" or ROI). According to Bright, most current light cargo vehicles only have a fuel economy of about and the improved fuel efficiency of the IDEA could save companies money after the second or third year of ownership, based on the price per gallon of fuel.  Services  In late 2008, Bright launched the eSolutions consulting and design service, which worked with current vehicle parts manufacturers to accelerate the process of vehicle electrification. eSolutions partnered with fleets and car component manufacturers (i.e., clients) to create lighter, more aerodynamic parts and system solutions that can then be used in future electric vehicles.\\"Bright Automotive announces eSolutions, army plug-in hybrid contract ‚Äî Autoblog Green.\\" Autoblog Green ‚Äî We Obsessively Cover The Green Scene. http://green.autoblog.com/2009/10/28/bright-automotive-announces-esolutions- army-plug-in-hybrid-cont/ (accessed February 3, 2011). eSolutions won a significant contract was with the US Army Tank Command (TACOM) to develop, deliver, and test electric plug-in technology on non-combat vehicles. This contract, worth over $4 million, tested plug-in hybrid technology to replace present non-combat military vehicles and, most importantly, to provide power back to the electrical grid for off-grid operations on forward operating bases (FOBs). eSolutions provided the main income for Bright.Eisenstein, Paul A.. \\"Is There A Bright Future For Bright Automotive?

This involves taking a currently combustion engine powered car and turning it either into a hybrid or a fully electric car. Bright advertised the service specifically for the VW Routan, VW Transporter, and the Dodge Grand Caravan; however, they were able to retrofit essentially any vehicle. In 2010 Bright eSolutions won a contract with the US Postal Service to deliver an all-electric conversion vehicle of a US Postal delivery truck. Bright eSolutions successfully delivered the US Postal Service EV and it has been in operation in Washington DC since 2010.\\"Hybrid Vehicle Manufacturing and Services Company - Bright Automotive.\\" Hybrid Vehicle Manufacturing and Services Company - Bright Automotive. http://www.brightautomotive.com/ (accessed February 3, 2011).

Leadership  The last CEO of Bright Automotive was Reuben Munger, the founder of Vision Ridge Partners, which is an investment company specializing in clean technology. Munger was also a Managing Director at Baupost Group, LLC investing firm. Bright‚Äôs last COO was Mike Donoughe, who spent 28 years working for US Steel, Chrysler, Daimler-Chrysler, and Tesla.

Coping refers to behaviors that attempt to protect oneself from psychological damage. Alternatives to avoidance coping include modifying or eliminating the conditions that gave rise to the problem and changing the perception of an experience in a way that neutralizes the problem. Avoidance coping, including social withdrawal, is an aspect of avoidant personality disorder, but not everyone who displays such behaviors meets the definition of having a personality disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder may include avoidance coping behavior: PTSD sufferers may draw into themselves, avoiding the trauma and partaking in cognitive or behavioral avoidance coping. Therapy Cognitive behavioral and psychoanalytic therapy are used to help those coping by avoidance to acknowledge, comprehend, and express their emotions. Acceptance and commitment therapy, a behavioral therapy that focuses on breaking down avoidance coping and showing it to be an unhealthy method for dealing with traumatic experiences, is also sometimes used. Both active- cognitive and active-behavioral coping are used as replacement techniques for avoidance coping. Active-cognitive coping includes changing one's attitude towards a stressful event and looking for any positive impacts. Active- behavioral coping refers taking positive actions after finding out more about the situation. Beneficial forms of avoidance coping Literature on coping often classifies coping strategies into two broad categories: approach/active coping and avoidance/passive coping. Approach coping includes behaviors that attempt to reduce stress by alleviating the problem directly, and avoidance coping includes behaviors that reduce stress by distancing oneself from the problem. Traditionally, approach coping has been seen as the healthiest and most beneficial way to reduce stress, while avoidance coping has been associated with negative personality traits, potentially harmful activities, and generally poorer outcomes. However, research has shown that some types of avoidance coping have beneficial outcomes. A study by Long and Haney found that both jogging and relaxation techniques were equally successful at reducing anxiety and increasing feelings of self-efficacy. Therefore, it seems that positive forms of passive coping such as exercise and meditation have qualitatively different outcomes from negative forms such as binge eating and drug use. These positive forms of passive coping may be particularly beneficial for alleviating stress when the individual does not currently have the resources to eliminate the problem directly, indicating the advantage of flexibility when engaging in coping behaviors.

He was born in Veszpr√©m on 1 May 1854. His father was Joseph Kolossv√°ry, a lawyer and landowner, his mother was Carolina Nedeczky. He enrolled at the military academy in Vienna, graduating in 1876 and serving as a lieutenant in the 10th Hussars regiment. In 1881 he was assigned to the General Staff, and promoted to captain in 1884 and to major in 1891. In 1896 he became a lieutenant colonel (full colonel in May 1897) and was the director of the Evidenzbureau (Austro-Hungarian military intelligence) between 1896 and 1898. This was followed in May 1898 by appointment as chief of the Operations Bureau (Bureaus f√ºr operative Generalstabsarbeiten). In 1901 Kolossv√°ry left the Austro-Hungarian General Staff and moved to the Royal Hungarian Honv√©d, the Territorial Army based in his native Hungary, in which he took command of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade. In May 1903 he was promoted to the rank of major general. However, only a month later, in June of the same year, he accepted the position of Hungary's Minister of Defence in the short-lived, crisis-ridden cabinet headed by Khuen-H√©derv√°ry between June and November 1903. Part of the crisis, left unresolved when Kolossv√°ry's short foray into politics ended, concerned a controversial conscription bill. Kolossv√°ry's successor as defence minister, Major General S√°ndor Nyiry, agreed to let him return to active military service. In 1904 he commanded the 14th Cavalry Brigade in Rzesz√≥w. In August 1906 he commanded a division located in Stanislav (now Ivano-Frankivsk). The remaining years of Kolossv√°ry's military career were spent in the environs of Lemberg (Lviv), the chief city of Galicia. In November 1907 he was promoted to lieutenant-general and appointed to command of the 30th Infantry Division based in Lemberg. On 31 October 1912 he advanced to command of the 11th Army Corps in the same area. As such, Kolossv√°ry took part in the Battle of Galicia in the early stages of the First World War, subordinate to Rudolf von Brudermann, who led the Austria-Hungarian 3rd army. Following the disastrous Austria-Hungarian defeat in that battle, and specifically the loss of Lemberg to the Russians, Kolossv√°ry was in September 1914 removed from command of the 11th Army Corps. He got no further appointment, going on an indefinite leave of absence on 1 February 1915, and having no further part in the war. He died on 5 April 1919 at the age of 65, in Sopron.

History  NABOTU was set up in 1997 to promote authorship, publishing and the development of a culture of reading in Uganda. It was the successor body to the Uganda Publishers and Booksellers Association (UPABA) which had been formed in the early 1990s as a forum for promoting a good policy environment for Uganda‚Äôs publishing industry. At the time of the formation of NABOTU, Uganda had started to embrace an open and competitive publishing environment following the adoption of the textbook policy in 1998. The textbook policy which allows 5 different titles for every school subject marked the emergence of a local publishing industry in Uganda which hitherto was dominated by multinational publishers. In 2000, NABOTU was one of the founding book councils together with the National Book Development Council of Kenya (NBDCK) and Baraza Ya Maendeleo Vitabu Tanzania (BAMVITA) of the East African Book Development Association (EABDA). Under the EABDA outfit with the support of Sida, Book Aid International and Hivos, NABOTU has been implementing the East Africa Book Development Programme. The goal of the programme is the eradication of poverty through literacy enhancement. The programme has several projects including Children‚Äôs Reading Tents; support to school library development; rural community library development; annual National Book Week Festivals; skills development for book sector professionals like authors, publishers, booksellers, etc.; literary awards; book donations and advocacy on issues like textbook policy, national book policy, book trade, copyright, right to write and read, etc. NABOTU has recently expanded the programme with the support of the International Federation of Reprographic Rights Organisations (IFRRO) and IDRC to include copyright management and research on new publishing innovations such as flexible copyright licensing.  Programmes  The East African Book Development Programme whose goal is the eradication of poverty through literacy enhancement is currently being implemented in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. The programme creatively engages the target groups to embrace a culture of reading through different activities including; *Children‚Äôs and Community Reading TentsAnna J√∂nsson and Josefin Olsson, \\"Reading culture and literacy in Uganda. The case of the 'Children‚Äôs Reading Tent'\\", Essays.se. (CRTs) organized throughout the year in different parts of Uganda by specialized NABOTU members including: National Library of Uganda (NLU), Reading Association of Uganda (RAU), Uganda Library and Information Association (ULIA), Uganda Women Writers Association (FEMRITE), Uganda Children‚Äôs Writers and Illustrators Association (UCWIA), City Education Department of Kampala City Council and the Literature Fraternity of Uganda (LIFU) . CRTs introduce Ugandan children to the joys of travel, discovery and engagement which children‚Äôs fiction and other creative writings from sources such as newspapers, magazines etc. offer. Children engage in silent reading, read-aloud marathons, spellings and word identification, storytelling, story writing, painting and book making. Hundreds of locally published children‚Äôs storybooks are donated to each participating school to enable them establish school libraries with substantial collections of local storybooks.Elisam Magara and Charles Batambuze, \\"The School Library Development Programme in Pallisa District, Uganda: an impact study\\", IFLA Journal, 22 May 2009. The book donation also includes selections of children‚Äôs readers on HIV/AIDS. The readers were carefully crafted to reflect different themes such as African culture, tradition and HIV/AIDS, stigma and discrimination etc. to empower children with valuable information and experiences. Authors of such books visit the CRTs to read and lead a discussion based on their book. Teachers from the beneficiary schools are trained in teaching reading methodologies, promoting reading and managing a school library. There is evidence beginning to emerge showing that exposing children to storybooks lays a good foundation for their learning and education. Several schools across the country that have adopted reading programmes have registered improvements in academic performance. The CRT programme has won NABOTU international accolades including in 2007, the IFLA/Guust van Wessemael Literacy Prize . *National Book Week Festival organized by NABOTU is a literary celebration of books and reading and their contribution to the development of Uganda culturally, socially, economically and politically which is celebrated once every year throughout Uganda. Several activities are held during the book week to rally support for the important role that writing of books and reading play in developing an individual Ugandan‚Äôs potential and that of the entire country. The book week helps to dispel the notion that Ugandans have a poor reading culture by drawing on a very rich programme countrywide to attract or encourage them to become readers for life. Activities include: the Book Sector Forum organized by the East African School of Library and Information Science , Makerere University which is an annual conference for the different actors in Uganda‚Äôs publishing industry with a view to generate ideas for changing the environment of book trade within Uganda and across the borders; the Kampala Book Fair organized by the Uganda Publishers Association (UPA) in close collaboration with the Uganda Booksellers Association (UBA) which is an annual trade fair of books and other reading materials and services related to the publishing industry; the Schools Book Week programme which is a series of activities including read-aloud marathons, storytelling, book discussions, debates on a book related theme etc. organized by the over 15,000 primary schools across Uganda in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Sports. The schools book week programme draws in 7.4 million school children and their teachers to celebrate the book week. Other book week activities include: the Author reading organized by the Uganda Women Writers Association (FEMRITE) which brings together some of Uganda‚Äôs leading creative writers to discuss their works with the public made up of writers, literary critics, academics, book reviewers, publishers, librarians and book enthusiasts; the NABOTU Literary Awards organized by the Literature Fraternity of Uganda (LIFU) which is an annual prize for both published and unpublished writers recognizing their excellence in creative writing and providing a motivation for more creativity; Library activities organized by the National Library of Uganda (NLU) in over 40 rural and public libraries across Uganda showcasing their collections, services, public readings and book discussions and; a Poetry night showcasing recitals and stage performances of some of Uganda‚Äôs best poetry. *Advocacy and Policy Development a programme under which NABOTU and its members engage policy makers and implementers to resolve any outstanding issues that may be hampering the development of writing, publishing and reading in Uganda. Some of the issues that form NABOTU‚Äôs current advocacy agenda include: textbook policy, national book policy, textbook procurement systems and book distribution, library development and funding, funding models for school textbooks and supplementary readers, curriculum reviews, trade and taxation issues as they affect book trade, basic freedoms to write and publish etc. The existence of NABOTU has been instrumental in safeguarding key policies that form a foundation for Uganda‚Äôs book industry such as the textbook policy. The decentralized instruction materials procurement programme (DIMP) which was at the beginning of 2009 replaced with the Hybrid book procurement guidelines with ongoing discussions on the inclusion of booksellers. *Training of book sector professionals a programme that provides the learning of crucial skills required for improving both products and services offered by the book industry. NABOTU offers training opportunities for authors, illustrators, graphic designers, publishers, booksellers, librarians, teachers etc.  Copyright and publishing innovations  The programme seeks to broaden understanding of copyright law by authors, publishers, legal advisors and all rightsholders and users. Following the enactment of the Uganda Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act 2006, there has been increasing pressure from copyright holders to put in place systems that facilitate enforcement. NABOTU is supporting the establishment of the Uganda Reproduction Rights Organisation (URRO) as a collective management organization for its rightsholders. If established, URRO will follow the successful path in rights management and enforcement already set by the Uganda Performing Rights Society (UPRS) in the music industry. NABOTU is involved in researching the adoption of open access publishing by commercial publishers, research institutes and NGOs as a means of improving access to learning materials in Uganda. This is under the Publishing and Alternative Licensing Models for Africa (PALM Africa) project funded by IDRC currently being implemented in Uganda and South Africa. A publishing experiment involving two commercial publishers i.e. Fountain Publishers Ltd and Mastermind Ltd and; an NGO the Uganda Women Writers Association (FEMRITE) is experimenting with web based published books issued under a creative commons license exploring usage as per the number of downloads and quotations, orders for physical copies of the books and new business models adopted .

The independent analyst firm Gartner has recently called Dynamic Business Modeling \\"critical for BSS solutions to succeed\\". Dynamic Business Modeling is based on principles wherein the business logic of an application is managed independently from the application servers that automate the services and processes defined in the business logic. Business modeling and integration (which itself is defined as part of the business model) are defined in a business logic layer, allowing underlying application servers to be business logic agnostic and therefore need no business driven customization. DBM applied correctly should reduce both the cost and risk in the initial implementation and its future evolution of systems. Previous generations of IT systems (from 1990 to approximately 2001) were designed to address specific business models and regulatory practices and no value was given to logic‚Äìinfrastructure segregation. These systems provided value by automating predefined business models (commonly referred to as \\"off- the-shelf\\"). As a result, they implicitly drove business strategy where DBM states that they should be driven by it. By being \\"predefined\\" they do not: * openly incorporate business changes in the business landscape of an industry * leverage potential business models that new technologies allow Dynamic Business modeling is suited for open automation of strategy-driven business models. By removing the need for customization of core application servers it is postulated as more cost efficient, rapidly deployed and evolveable. Dynamic Business Modeling was initially described (though applied much earlier in practice) by Doug Zone at MetraTech Corp. in reference to the billing segment of the enterprise software market. \\"Service Oriented Applications\\" (also known as \\"service based applications\\") coined by IBM describe potential methodologies to achieve DBM. Technical definition  Dynamic Business Modeling is defined as the automation of Enterprise Business Models based on the principle that the model's underlying business processes and business services need to be dynamically and openly definable and re-definable. Business definition  Dynamic Business Modeling is defined as the enabler of a strategic advantage achieved by focused differentiation in any aspect of business (from marketing to finance to operations). This differentiation is achieved through how business is conducted: openly and dynamically defining the business model. Capital investment ‚Äì human, physical and intellectual ‚Äì must be aimed at allowing the definition of the business model to be dynamic. Dynamic Business Modeling recognises that businesses dynamically evolve, re- inventing their (business) models to achieve strategic advantage. DBM posits that the role of enterprise software (CRM, billing, ERP) is to dynamically automate and advance the business processes and services that lie behind these Business models. History The term was first used to describe the architecture of MetraNet, a charging, billing, settlement and customer care from MetraTech Corp. Core principles  # Business strategy drives selection of business models. # These business models drive the design of underlying processes and services. #* Business Analysis is critical: Any number of models can address a strategic imperative. But the best models, services and processes will exploit existing business capabilities (human, IT and physical), the areas where change is possible and the areas where investment will make most change possible at the lowest cost. # Enterprise software automates these services and processes. # DBM enables change: Strategic adeptness requires tuning and/or the re-definition of the present Business Model. #* The business must begin with the principle that allows rapid tuning and/or re-definition of the underlying services and processes. This must apply at human and technological levels. Key success criteria  # Open modeling capabilities: #* Dynamic Business Modeling requires IT architecture and enterprise applications that automate the business model ‚Äì not just a business model. # Ease of modeling: #* Definition and automation of new and evolved business services and processes must be accessible at the business analysis level. Ideally the models and its services and processes are defined and stored in open business analyst oriented data (for example metadata.) # Open integration: #* Dynamic Business Modeling must work with processes and services (both automated and human) that are NOT dynamic. These fixed constraints are not external to the new business model but are part of its fabric. IT Architecture and Enterprise applications must be able to incorporate, embed and/or build upon these existing processes and services. # Robustness: #* Regardless of the dynamism of the business model. The automated and human-based business processes and services must have all the robustness of long standing static processes and services. Dynamic IT automation must have a full audit capability, reprocessing ability and standards compliance (i.e. PCI). # Perpetual dynamism: #* Automation is never finished. Processes and services change and are added constantly. IT Architecture and Enterprise applications must be designed to prevent ‚Äúlock down‚Äù where the service and process automation on ‚ÄúDay One‚Äù is so tightly coupled that only minor evolution is economic. SOA principles of openness and loss coupling must be applied inside business applications. Best practice  # DBM is service- based: #* The application should be based on the principle that processes and integration can be de-constructed internally into services. # Services and processes are loosely coupled: #* Changing one should not impact the others. # Services and process definitions are open: #* And accessible to a business analyst. Ideally definitions are kept in metadata. # Application servers must be free of embedded business logic: #* For services, processes, data, workflows alike. # Dynamic documentation is a feature: #* As the model evolves the documentation must evolve as well. The application should allow the business analyst to document at service level and then generate a cohesive document that encompasses entire model. # Business Analyst Interface is friendly and flexible: #* The application must provide a way to put the definition of services and processes in analyst terms ‚Äì using universal concepts such as flows and tables. The interface should encourage documentation, warn on inconsistencies, and allow testing.

He is a singer, percussionist, and guitarist known for his Garifuna music and is considered a Cultural Ambassador of the Garifuna people.http://www.aureliomusic.net/bio/https://realworldrecords.com/artist/3662/aurelio/ According to the Guardian, he became the leading Garifuna performer after the death of musician Andy Palacio.https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/19/aurelio-darandi-review- real-world-stonetree-martinez-guayo-cedeno From 2006 to 2010, Martinez served as a congressman for the National Congress of Honduras, becoming its first black member.  Biography  Singer-songwriter, guitarist and percussionist, Aurelio Martinez aka AURELIO (born 1969), is one of Central America's most gifted performers. Born in Honduras, the artist is known for his powerful and evocative voice. He is a major tradition-bearer of the Garifuna culture and music and he is considered nowadays as the Cultural Ambassador of the Garifuna nation. The Garinagu, commonly known as the Garifuna are people of Amerindian and West African descents who live along the coasts of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The original home of the Garifuna is St. Vincent (one of the windward islands in the West Indies) from which they were deported in 1796 by the British government and landed on Roatan island, situated in the Bay Islands of Honduras. Aurelio grew up in a small Caribbean village called Plaplaya, surrounded by a family of talented musicians. His father was a well- known local troubadour who improvised Paranda songs containing Garifuna roots rhythms and Latin sounds. Following the influence of his uncles and grandfather, he became a brilliant drummer in his early childhood. From his vocally gifted mother, he learned to sing and picked up many songs she crafted. Actually, Aurelio began performing at Garifuna ceremonies when just a boy, even at the most sacred events where children were usually not even allowed. At the age of 14, the young man became a respected musician with a firm grounding in Garifuna rhythms, rituals and songs. While attending secondary school at the provincial capital of La Ceiba, Aurelio dove into diverse and innovative musical projects that took him outside the traditional sphere of performance. By this time, he played professionally with popular Latin ensembles and refined his musical skills. In the late 80's, he created his first group called Lita Ariran, who was one of the first Garifuna traditional music and dance group to appear on the international scene and most specifically in Japan. His first album was produced by his friend Akira Tomita with the Japanese company JVC World Sounds (Grupo Garifuna de Honduras, LITA ARIRAN (JVC Records, 1995). Later, Aurelio received the award for the Best singer of Garifuna music and his group Lita Ariran was rewarded for the Best cultural group of the year at the Garifuna World Music Awards, in New York (1998). The less we could say is that Lita Ariran's first and unique album remains most certainly a legendary treasure of the Garifuna music nowadays. In 1997, Aurelio meets his Belizean friend and fellow musician Andy Palacio. The two artists struck up a decades-long friendship thanks in part to their shared hopes for the future of Garifuna music and culture. Through Palacio, Aurelio met Ivan Duran, the tireless producer behind Belize's Stonetree Records. The same year, the young artist participated in a paranda project, including the King of Paranda Paul Nabor \\"Nabi\\", Junie Aranda, Jursino Cayetano, Andy Palacio, among others. Critics around the world acknowledge PARANDA: AFRICA IN CENTRAL AMERICA (Stonetree Records, 1999) as being one of the best albums to come out of this part of the world. It is in fact a very rich collection of three generations of paranderos with a depth and range that grows with each listen. From the haunting, bluesy exuberance of Paul Nabor's \\"Naguya Nei\\" to the fresh sounds of Aurelio's \\"Africa\\", this album takes the listener through the tapestry of feeling and soulful striving that lies at the heart of the Garifuna culture. In 2004, Aurelio releases his first solo album called GARIFUNA SOUL produced by his friend and long time collaborator Ivan Duran (Stonetree Records, 2004), backed by some of Belize's and Honduras‚Äô best studio musicians who improvised adeptly on Garifuna percussion, saxophone, electric and bass guitars. Undoubtedly, the artist takes the music into the future without compromising whatsoever the cultural foundations of his inspiration. Aurelio's rich resonant voice and soulful acoustic songs caught the attention of the global music press and saw him as a tradition-bearer with an innate musicality and subtle innovative streak. Indeed, AfroPop Worldwide names him ‚ÄúNewcomer of the year‚Äù. Two years later (2006), Aurelio, a new born gifted musician takes on another role as a politician in the Honduran National Congress, becoming this way the first Garifunacongressman of his region in the country's history. For this occasion, the politician's main goal was to represent and support the Garifuna people through concrete manifestations that would protect their integrity as a whole. Precisely, the idea was to lead innovative actions to improve the daily life of this population as well as to feed and preserve their cultural treasures. In the meantime, the Spanish public television (RTVE) produces: Honduras y Belice: la Aventura Garifuna, an original documentary that features simultaneously, the encounter between old paranda's singers and the Garifuna's way of life of yesterday and today's generations. Aurelio is the star of this journey: a very popular young musician who later becomes known as one of the best paranderos. Thanks to its richness, this documentary is definitely an interesting audiovisual reference to introduce oneself into the surrounding world of the artist. In 2007, Aurelio was invited to participate in the album WATINA (Stonetree Records, Cumbancha, 2007) featuring Andy Palacio and The Garifuna Collective who received the prestigious WOMEX Award, a respected acknowledgment from the world music industry. Additionally, the album Watina was declared the Greatest World Music Album of All Times by Amazon.com in 2010. Andy Palacio passed away unexpectedly at the young age of 48, leaving the Garifuna community stunned and bereft. ‚ÄùAurelio was still a congressman, but he left the congress session to go to Belize for the funeral,‚Äù Duran recalls. ‚ÄúHe hadn‚Äôt been playing guitar for months because of his intense political commitments. But after Andy‚Äôs passing, he gave a few concerts and he knew he needed to start recording right away.‚Äù Together with Ivan Duran, several veteran Garifuna musicians, and the occasional local ensemble dropping into the studio, Aurelio began laying down the tracks for this recording in a cabana on the beach. Laru Beya was not only a way of honoring Andy Palacio as a person; it was a means for continuing his mission of uplifting and expanding what it meant to be a Garifuna artist. By the year 2008, Aurelio was selected worldwide musician by the Afropop legend Youssou N‚ÄôDour, within the Rolex Mentor and Prot√©g√© Arts Initiative. Most definitely, this was a major event allowing Aurelio and the Garifuna music to open up for the first time to African famous musicians. With no doubt, this opportunity of sharing was another main step in the artist's developing career. Aside of exchanging valuable points of view about the former it gave him new ideas about musical technical features as well as an exciting possibility to share the stage with Youssou N‚Äô Dour in places such as Senegal, New York (Nokia Theater) and Vienna (Vienna Jazz Festival). At the end of this journey, Aurelio's dream of traveling one day to the African continent finally became true. Three years later, as part of a result of Youssou N‚ÄôDour's collaboration, Aurelio releases his second album LARU BEYA (Stonetree Records, Real World Records, SUBPOP, 2011), a compilation of soulful songs linking back to the African roots. N‚ÄôDour adds his stirring vocals to two of its songs, while elsewhere there is backing from those great veterans of the Afro-Cuban scene, Orchestra Baobab, and from Senegalese rapper Sen Kump√©. Laru Beya wins sixth place in the Top 20 World Music Albums of 2011 in the WorldMusic.co.uk Award. ‚ÄúAurelio is a highly talented musician, conscious composer and passionate performer with an excellent band behind him, as well as being the prime advocate for a unique culture. If anyone is going to put the Garifuna culture onto the map, it is Aurelio Martinez‚Äù, wrote the WorldMusic.co.uk website. After his debut in the African scene, Aurelio makes a return to his musical roots with his third album LANDINI, (Stonetree Records, Real World Records, 2014). This last composition draws a traditional scenario of the Garifuna community way of life. Most specifically, the album shows a gentle picture of the paranda musical environment in Plaplaya, the artist's dear hometown. Traditionally, after a long day of fishing, villagers return into their boats to the river landing and gather for a convivial paranda session. This symbolic image leads us to the album's present name: ‚Äúlandini‚Äù, from the English word: ‚Äúlanding‚Äù. According To Aurelio, \\"I consider this album to be the sound of my Garifuna people. On the previous album [Laru Beya] we experimented and collaborated with other artists to reconnect what was lost between Africa and America. This album is purely Garifuna, and the entire spirit of the music reflects the Garifuna experience. My mother is the sole inspiration for this album. She sees herself reflected in me, to a large degree, the only one of the family who could fulfill her dream of singing professionally. She's the best example I have in my life of what a human being should be, my main consultant and confidante.\\" L√°ndini was named to multiple 2014 year-end critics lists, including: #3 on The Sunday Times Ten Best World Music Albums of 2014, #3 on fRoots Critic's Poll New Albums of 2014, #2 World Music Central Best World Music Albums 2014, Songlines 10 Best Albums of the Year 2014, Curious Animal's Best Albums of 2014, #1 Songlines 50 Greatest World Music Albums of the Last Years. The Garifuna community of New York honored Aurelio in March 2015 with a special musical tribute and concert to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his career. On 17 January, Aurelio launched his new album DARANDI, a collection of Aurelio's favorite songs from his career recorded to capture the sound of his incendiary live performances accompanied by some of the Garifuna world's brightest musical talents. The album has been receiving great reviews by the press: ‚ÄúThe Garifuna have a history of escaping slavery ‚Ä¶ That experience informs the indomitable spirit and characteristic joie de vivre of their music, expressed via the paranda, a unique up-tempo rhythm and melodies that are as listenable as they are danceable to. ***** ‚Äù (Morning Star). ‚ÄúThis is his best album to date ‚Ä¶ Recording with his band 'as live' in the studio, he brings new energy and emotion to favorites that range from the charming and slinky 'Laru Beya' to the lament 'Yange,' or a fresh version of 'Dondo,' a paranda classic driven on by tremolo electric guitar lines from Guayo Cede√±o. **** ‚Äù (The Guardian). fRoots named Aurelio as ‚Äúthe finest living exponent of the music of the Garifuna people‚Äù and London Evening Standard called him ‚Äúone of the great artists of Latin America.\\" ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to let this culture die. I know I must continue my ancestors‚Äô legacy and find new ways to express it. Few people know about it, but I adore it, and it's something I must share with the world.‚Äù Aurelio.

History Origins Modern construction at Lansdowne Road. The original building was bombed in WW2 In 1852 one Richard Roy, a solicitor with some experience of building speculation in Cheltenham, acquired from the Ladbroke Estate a freehold parcel of undeveloped land between the south side of what is now Arundel Gardens and the north side of Ladbroke Gardens. In around 1862-3 he granted building leases for the houses on the south side of the street (numbers 1-47), and around the same time granted leases to three other builders to construct houses on the north side of the street. This was consistent with the usual pattern of development on the Ladbroke Estate, which was for builders to purchase the right to build on a parcel of land, on which they would contract to construct a certain number of houses. They were obliged to pay a ground rent to the landowner, but in return were granted a 99-year lease on the property. The houses on both sides back onto elegant communal gardens, originally known as \\"pleasure grounds\\", or \\"paddocks\\", which are typical of the Ladbroke Estate so fall into the broad definition of garden squares. The original residents of the street tended to be middle or upper-middle class professionals, with around three or four servants, though a few were of a more bohemian character.

An angry mob attacked the nearby Electric Cinema, believing that its German-born manager was signalling to the Zeppelin raiders from the roof of the cinema.www.historytalk.org Retrieved January 2012 During World War II Arundel Gardens again suffered from bombing. One local resident, Vere Hodgson, recorded in her diary in 1940: \\"Went to see the houses in Lansdowne Road [next to Arundel Gardens] that caught it. Just heaps of rubble....right on the corner of Ladbroke Grove.\\" Hodgson, Vere, Few Eggs and No Oranges 1940-1945, published by Persephone Books Arundel Gardens today Arundel Gardens, March 2010 The appearance of the street remains little changed today, except for numbers 43-47, on the corner of Ladbroke Grove, which have been replaced by a modern block of flats. Most of the remaining Victorian buildings have had extra mansard stories or loft conversions added, and most have been subdivided into flats, rather than remaining as single family residences for which purpose they were originally designed. A few of the stuccoed cornices are missing, and some of the houses on the south side have had their brickwork painted over. In 2008 the council planted a number of trees in the street. Otherwise the appearance of the street is much as it was when it was originally constructed. A view of Arundel Gardens is shown in the 1999 film Notting Hill. The route of the Notting Hill Carnival passes along Arundel Gardens. Criticism The authors of the Survey of London published by the Greater London Council (now organised by English Heritage) in 1973 were not impressed by Arundel Gardens, which they saw as representing a decline from the elegance of earlier parts of the Ladbroke Estate. The street is described as \\"dull four-story ranges, that on the north side being faced with stucco and that on the south side being of stock brick with coarse flamboyant stucco enrichments\\". The authors did however concede that the Eastward vista along the street was \\"agreeably closed\\" by attractive buildings built by Thomas Pocock on Kensington Park Road.Survey of London Retrieved January 2012 Notable residents Blue Plaque at 12 Arundel Gardens commemorating the work of William Ramsay. * Charles Samuel Myers (1873‚Äì1946), psychologist, lived at 27 Arundel Gardens as a boy.

He was a close friend of Stefan ≈ªeromski and Karol Irzykowski. His novels and short stories were inspired by the fantastic works of Antoni Lange and Stefan Grabi≈Ñski. His poems were influenced by the traumatic experiences of both World Wars. He was born on April 6, 1888 in Krak√≥w. His parents were the lawyer Kazimierz and Maria n√©e Ripper. In 1906‚Äì10, he began studying law at the Jagiellonian University, but after the first half of a year he moved to the Faculty of Philosophy the history of literature, art history and philosophy, earning a doctorate in 1911.

Matches are much shorter, usually played as two ten-minute halves. Unlike the other two major rugby union variants - sevens and beach rugby - which were invented in major rugby nations, rugby tens was developed in Malaysia, a nation that has never qualified for the Rugby World Cup.Bath, p 71 The rules (law variations) are similar to rugby sevens and are published on the World Rugby website.Tens law variations. World Rugby. History Rugby tens was introduced by the Combined Old Boys Rugby Association (COBRA) of Malaysia in 1967 primarily, to enable Asian players to better compete with against larger-sized players from the traditional rugby playing nations. COBRA organized the first Rugby ten-a-side, tournament, COBRA 10s, that same year. It has grown from a local tournament into a prestigious international tournament, with more than 40 nations have been represented to date. Many players who have participated in the COBRA 10s have gone on to don national colours. The game is fairly popular in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Republic of Korea and Thailand, and especially in South Africa where it is growing very fast. Other tournaments have been organised in Europe, Africa, Australasia and North America.10s Rugby Tournaments Features of the game Unlike sevens rugby, tens offer players of diverse skills, capabilities and different fitness levels the opportunity to continue to enjoy the game they love so much. The more traditional scrums and lineouts are part of the game whilst the fact that there is a bit more space on the field, however not too much as to expose the slower forwards on the defensive lines, makes this a very popular game for all levels of players.  Tournaments Major rugby tens tournaments include: * COBRA Rugby Tens (since 1967) * Hong Kong Football Club Tens (since 1986),Bath, p 29HKFC Tens * Cape Town Tens (since 2009) * World Club 10s * Brisbane Global Rugby Tens * Flanders Open Rugby (since 1993),Flanders Open Rugby Tournament * Manila 10s (since 1989) * Stockholm 10s (since 1993) The popular Cape Town Tens attracts teams from all over the world to South Africa during the first week of February each year.Cape Town Tens References * Bath, Richard (ed.)

Normally known as \\"Mountain\\" types, New York Central 4-8-2 steam locomotives were dubbed \\"Mohawk\\" types after the Mohawk River, which the New York Central followed. Built for dual service work, the 3001 was used heavily for freight and passenger trains until being retired in 1957. Today the locomotive is currently on display at the National New York Central Railroad Museum in Elkhart, Indiana. It is the largest New York Central steam locomotive still in existence and is one of only two surviving New York Central \\"Mohawks\\"; the other, No. 2933, is currently on display at the Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, MO. History In the late 1930s, when looking for heavier steam power to move freight and passenger trains swiftly, the New York Central looked at a dual service steam locomotive. The modern 1940 L3a from ALCo was able to move both heavy passenger trains and freights with relative ease. So, the NYC acquired both the L-3 and L-4 classes of Mohawks from the American Locomotive Company and Lima Locomotive Works from 1940 to 1943. Service Life New York Central No. 3001 is a member of the L-3a class of locomotives. Based in Ohio after the NYC dieselized east of Cleveland on August 7, 1953, the Mohawk powered many general freight and passenger trains, such as the 20th Century Limited. Until dieselization of that division in 1949, No. 3001 could often be seen hauling passenger trains on the Boston & Albany. No. 3001 was often used to haul freight trains due to many NYC Hudsons being occupied pulling passenger trains; in later years, diesel-electric locomotives hauled the passenger trains. In the final years of steam on the New York Central, the No. 3001 and other modern Mohawks were demoted to lighter trains; due to Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (NYC subsidiary) 2-8-4 \\"Berkshires\\" and NYC 4-8-4 Niagaras handling increasingly heavier freight and passenger trains on the system. As diesels flooded the NYC, the No. 3001 and the other steam locomotives still in service saw the end coming nearer and nearer. No. 3001 was finally retired on February 14, 1957. Preservation  The New York Central sold L3a No. 3001 to Texas & Pacific Railroad in March 1957, to replace the heavily vandalized and subsequently scrapped Texas & Pacific 2-10-4 No. 638 that was on display at the Texas State Fairgrounds there. The Texas & Pacific Railroad donated No. 3001 (disguised as Texas & Pacific No. 909) to the city of Dallas, TX. The city later donated No. 3001 (still disguised as Texas & Pacific No. 909) to the Museum of the American Railroad in Dallas. In May 1984, after trading Pennsylvania Railroad GG-1 No. 4903 to the Museum of the American Railroad, No. 3001 made its way east to Elkhart, IN after being acquired by the Lakeshore Railroad Historical Foundation. The sale to the Texas & Pacific Railroad is the sole reason why No. 3001 was not scrapped by the New York Central. Today, No. 3001 is on display at the National New York Central Railroad Museum. However, the locomotive is in a good enough condition to be selected for a possible return to steam at some point in time. See also PRR 6755- This is the Pennsylvania Railroad's version of the Mohawk that survives. Just like the 3001, the 6755 was a dual service locomotive.

In its typical preparation, it is a portion of breast, thigh, or wing that has been marinated in a water-based blend of seasoning, floured, fried, and finally covered in a paste or sauce that has been spiced with cayenne pepper. It is served atop slices of white bread with pickle chips. It is both the application of a spicy paste and the presentation that differentiates it from similar dishes, such as Buffalo wings. It can be viewed in similar context to other foods that have been tweaked to be unique in a regional way, such as the slugburger or the Mississippi Delta tamale. There are many restaurants in Nashville that serve a variant of the dish, and there is a citywide festival and competition celebrating it. The popularity of hot chicken has spread beyond the Southern United States due to the influence of Nashville's music industry. Preparation Although the components of the dish largely remain the same, the preparation of the dish can differ greatly. A pressure fryer or deep fryer can be used, although most restaurants serve a pan-fried product. Nearly all hot chicken is marinated in buttermilk to impart flavor and to retain the meat's juices upon frying. Some preparations of hot chicken are breaded and fried after application of the spice paste; the more traditional method has the paste applied immediately after the chicken is removed from the fryer. A typical Nashville-style hot chicken spice paste has two key ingredients: lard and cayenne pepper. The two are mixed together, three parts pepper to one part lard, and heated until they form a thick sauce. Some restaurants vary the composition of the paste, adding sugar, garlic, or additional hot sauce. The paste is applied to the fried chicken by the server using a spoon and latex gloves; it is lightly squeezed into the finished chicken by hand. The heat level of the chicken can be varied by the preparer by reducing or increasing the amount of paste applied. Variations Nashville-style hot fish Hot chicken strip on a stick The main variation to traditional hot chicken is in the application of the spice paste: before breading or after breading, and whether or not additional spices are applied. Recipes, cooking methods, and preparation steps for hot chicken are often closely guarded secrets, proprietary to the specific restaurant, so the appearance of the chicken may vary widely. Hot fish A variation of the hot chicken theme is hot fish, typically a breaded and fried whiting or catfish filet prepared using a similar cayenne paste as hot chicken, or using a cayenne powder blend sprinkled liberally over the filet. Some hot chicken restaurants also serve hot fish, but recently some have begun to specialize in hot fish only. History Anecdotal evidence suggests that spicy fried chicken has been served in Nashville's African-American communities for generations. The current dish may have been introduced as early as the 1930s; however, the current style of spice paste may only date back to the mid-1970s. It is generally accepted that the originator of hot chicken is the family of Andre Prince Jeffries, owner of Prince's Hot Chicken Shack. She has operated the restaurant since 1980; before that time, it was owned by her great-uncle, Thornton Prince III. Although impossible to verify, Jeffries says the development of hot chicken was an accident. Her great-uncle Thornton was purportedly a womanizer, and after a particularly late night out his girlfriend at the time cooked him a fried chicken breakfast with extra pepper as revenge. Instead, Thornton decided he liked it so much that, by the mid-1930s, he and his brothers had created their own recipe and opened the BBQ Chicken Shack caf√©. What began as breakfast revenge is now considered to be a staple food for late-night diners. On weekends, most restaurants dedicated to hot chicken are open very late (some past 4 am). , there are an estimated two dozen restaurants in the Nashville area that serve hot chicken, either as the focus or as part of a larger menu. For a time, country music stars Lorrie Morgan and Sammy Kershaw owned and operated a now-defunct hot chicken restaurant called \\"hotchickens.com\\". The former mayor of Nashville Bill Purcell is a devoted fan, sponsoring the Music City Hot Chicken Festival and giving numerous interviews touting the dish. While in office, he frequently referred to his table at Prince's Hot Chicken as his \\"second office\\". Reflecting the growing popularity of the dish, several cities in the United States host restaurants that serve hot chicken or a variation thereof, including Atlanta, New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, Birmingham, Louisville, Ann Arbor, Columbus, and Salt Lake City. The appeal of hot chicken has spread beyond the United States, with restaurants in Seoul, South Korea, and Melbourne, Australia, also serving this style of chicken. In January 2016, fast food chain KFC began selling \\"Nashville Hot Chicken\\" and \\"Nashville Hot Tenders\\" in its U.S. restaurants. This follows a trial run in the Pittsburgh area that it stated was \\"the most successful product testing in the company's recent history.\\" Following this, KFC released \\"Nashville Hot Chicken\\" in its UK restaurants for a limited run between May 22 and June 18, 2017.

It was first formed in 1918 during the First World War, operating as a bomber squadron in the Middle East. It reformed in 1937, serving in the bomber and anti-shipping roles during the Second World War. A third incarnation saw the squadron serving as a strategic missile squadron during the late 1950s and early 1960s. History First World War On 20 March 1918, a new squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was established at Port Said in British administrated Egypt. It was intended as a corps reconnaissance squadron, to work in support of the Army, and initially operated a mix of aircraft, including Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2es and Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12s.Halley 1980, p. 172.Lewis 1959, p. 60. The squadron re-equipped with Airco DH.9 light bombers in August that year, reinforcing 40th (Army) Wing as it prepared for a major offensive against Ottoman forces.Cutlack 1941, p. 151. On 19 September, the opening actions of the Battle of Megiddo began, with 144 Squadron attacking Turkish communication and command centres, including the headquarters of the Ottoman Seventh Army at Nablus. The Ottoman forces were soon in full retreat, and all available air power, including 144 Squadron, was sent to repeatedly attack the force of the Ottoman Seventh Army as it retreated through the Wadi al-Far'a, with the Seventh Army effectively destroyed by these sustained aerial attacks.Cutlack 1941, pp. 159‚Äì161. On 17 October 1918, the squadron moved to Mudros on the island of Lemnos near the Dardanelles, but the Armistice of Mudros ended the war against the Ottoman Empire on 30 October. The squadron returned to the United Kingdom in December, disbanding at RAF Ford on 4 February 1919. Reformation No. 144 Squadron reformed on 11 January 1937, when a flight from 101 Squadron, equipped with four Boulton & Paul Overstrand twin-engined bombers and based at RAF Bicester in Oxfordshire, was detached to form the cadre of the new squadron. 144 Squadron quickly received Avro Anson monoplanes to replace the obsolete Overstrand biplanes, and moved to RAF Hemswell in Lincolnshire on 8 February 1937.Thetford Aeroplane Monthly January 1995, p. 39. It supplemented its Ansons with Hawker Audax biplanes in March before replacing both with more modern Bristol Blenheim I bombers in August that year. By now a part of 5 Group of Bomber Command, the squadron re-equipped with Handley Page Hampdens in March 1939. Second World War The squadron was still equipped with Hampdens on the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, flying its first mission on 26 September, when it dispatched 12 aircraft to search for, and attack if found, German naval forces in the North Sea. On this occasion, however, it encountered no allowable targets. Three days later, the squadron sent out 11 aircraft over the Heligoland Bight in another search for German warships. The strike force split into two groups; while one formation spotted but failed to hit two German destroyers, the second formation was intercepted by Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, which shot down all five Hampdens.Air International November 1984, pp. 248‚Äì249.Richards 1995, pp. 35‚Äì36. The squadron started to fly night-time leaflet dropping raids over Germany from February 1940, and on 6 March it flew its first bombing raid against a German land target, the seaplane base at H√∂rnum on the island of Sylt. The squadron continued to operate in the night bomber role through the rest of 1940 and 1941. As a result of the Channel Dash in February 1942, when the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen managed to break the British blockade and sail from France through the English Channel to Germany, indicated to the RAF that their anti-shipping strike strength was inadequate, and it was decided to convert two Hampden squadrons to the torpedo bomber role, with 144 Squadron being one of the two chosen for conversion.Masson Aeroplane Monthly November 1989, p. 682. The squadron transferred from Bomber Command to 18 Group Coastal Command on 21 April 1942, moving to RAF Leuchars on the East coast of Scotland. It flew its first torpedo bomber mission on 27 July 1942.Rawlings 1982, p. 107. In Operation Orator, during September 1942, 32 Hampdens of 144 Squadron and 455 Squadron RAAF were sent to Murmansk in Northern Russia in order to support the Arctic convoy PQ 18, and to attack any German warships that might sortie from bases in Norway against the convoy. The squadron lost 5 Hampdens on the flight to Russia, with a further four of 455 Squadron's also lost. The German surface warships did not attack PQ 18, and the squadron's personnel returned to Britain aboard a cruiser in October, leaving its aircraft behind to be handed over to the Soviets.Masson Aeroplane Monthly November 1989, p. 685. In January 1943 the Squadron converted to the more capable Bristol Beaufighter, staying in the torpedo bomber role. After working up, it transferred to Algeria in June 1943, flying anti-shipping strikes over the Mediterranean until it returned to the United Kingdom in August. It continued anti-shipping operations over the North Sea from RAF Wick in Scotland, moving to RAF Davidstow Moor in Cornwall in May 1944 in preparation for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy, where it was tasked with protecting the invasion forces from German E-boats. It moved to RAF Strubby in Lincolnshire in July for operations against E-boats and German convoys off the Dutch coast. In September it moved to Banff, Aberdeenshireas part of the Banff Strike Wing, for operations off Norway. In January 1945, the squadron abandoned the torpedo role, concentrating in anti-flak suppression for the Strike Wing. It disbanded on 25 May 1945 at RAF Dallachy. Missiles On 1 December 1959, the squadron reformed at RAF North Luffenham in Rutland, equipped with three Thor Intermediate-range ballistic missiles, supplied by the United States under Project Emily. The missiles were operated under a dual key system, with the British in control of the launch sequence, and the Americans responsible for arming the missiles nuclear warhead, giving each nation a veto on using the missiles. The squadron, along with the rest of the Thor force, was brought to full readiness during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The squadron disbanded on 23 August 1963.

It had a straight cantilever lower wing which supported the markedly swept upper wing. Only one was built. Design and development The unusual appearance of the Parnall Imp was entirely due to its wings, for it was otherwise a conventional two-seat, single-engined biplane of its time.Flight 12 April 1928 pp.239-42, 256 Harold Bolas stated that he designed them to be simple and to allow the best possible view from either of the two cockpits. The simplicity came from the complete absence of the rigging wires that braced conventional biplanes and needed constant attention. Instead, the Imp had a cantilever lower wing which had not only to support itself but also most of the forces on the upper wing. These lower wings were unswept and rectangular, with an aspect ratio of about 4.9, though the ailerons occupied the whole of the trailing edge and about 40% of the chord. Since as cantilevers they had to be internally braced, the airfoil section was fairly thick, a variation on RAF31. Rather than the usual (in Britain) double-spar and rib construction, Bolas used multiple spanwise stringers or false spars, with longitudinal formers or airfoil shaped ribs, the whole covered in stress- bearing spruce veneer. This stressed skin chiefly carried the bending loads. The Imp was a single-bay biplane, with a single, strongly outward-leaning wide chord streamlined strut on each side, connecting the centre of the lower wing to the upper one. Though the upper wing was not a cantilever, it was constructed in the same way as the lower and joined to the fuselage from below at mid wing with a pair of N-shaped cabane struts. This upper wing was also straight and parallel-edged, with the same chord as the lower one, but greater in span and strongly swept at about 14.5o. As a result, the leading edge at the centre was above the engine bulkhead, and the trailing edge at the tips beyond and aft of those of the lower plane. With the assistance of a large cutout in the trailing edge, this arrangement provided a clear upward view from both cockpits. thumb The wings did not fold, but two people could dismantle both sets in about two minutes, first unclipping the bottom of the interplane strut, folding it and unhooking the centre section from the cabane for each upper wing in turn. The absence of ailerons on the upper plane simplified this procedure. The lower wings could then be detached with the release of catches and the removal of pins. The rest of the aircraft was conventional. The square-sided fuselage was built around four longerons, plywood covered and with a rounded decking. There were tandem cockpits fitted with dual control. The petrol tank was immediately ahead of the forward cockpit, with a baggage locker below it. The five cylinder radial Armstrong Siddeley Genet II, producing 80 hp (60 kW) was initially completely uncowled, but later was partially enclosed, with cylinder heads exposed for cooling. The tail, too, was conventional; a small fin carried a generous, rounded unbalanced rudder, and the cantilever, rectangular tailplane bore twin elevators with cut-away inner tips to allow rudder movement. A tailskid was fitted to the fuselage just before the rudder hinge. The main, single axle undercarriage was wide track ( 5 ft 1 in or 1.55 m), with main legs sloping inwards to meet the lower longerons at the leading ege of the lower wings and with a pair of bracing struts forward to the bottom of the engine bulkhead. Operational history thumb The sole Imp, registered G-EBTE, was first flown in 1927 at Yate. It gained its Certificate of Airworthiness in May 1928 and competed in the 1928 King's Cup race, where it finished in eighth place, piloted at almost 110 mph (177 km/h) by D.W. Bonham Carter. It was later used for flight trials of the 65 hp (48 kW) Pobjoy P seven-cylinder radial engine, then sold into private hands in August 1933,CAA registration document only to be scrapped that December.

He is known for contributions to differential geometry. Academic history Lott received his B.S. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1978 and M.A. degrees in mathematics and physics from University of California, Berkeley. In 1983, he received a Ph.D. in mathematics under the supervision of Isadore Singer. After postdoctoral positions at Harvard University and the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques, he joined the faculty at the University of Michigan. In 2009, he moved to University of California, Berkeley. Among his awards and honors: * Sloan Research Fellowship (1989-1991) * Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship (1991-1992) * U.S. National Academy of Sciences Award for Scientific Reviewing (with Bruce Kleiner) Mathematical contributions A seminal 1985 article of Dominique Bakry and Michel √âmery introduced a generalized Ricci curvature, in which one adds to the usual Ricci curvature the hessian of a function.Bakry, D.; √âmery, Michel. Diffusions hypercontractives. S√©minaire de probabilit√©s, XIX, 1983/84, 177‚Äì206, Lecture Notes in Math., 1123, Springer, Berlin, 1985.. In 2003, Lott showed that much of the standard comparison geometry results for the Ricci tensor extend to the Bakry-√âmery setting. For instance, if is a closed and connected Riemannian manifold with positive Bakry-√âmery Ricci tensor, then the fundamental group of must be finite; if instead the Bakry-√âmery Ricci tensor is negative, then the isometry group of the Riemannian manifold must be finite. The comparison geometry of the Bakry-√âmery Ricci tensor was taken further in a influential article of Guofang Wei and William Wylie.Wei, Guofang; Wylie, Will. Comparison geometry for the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor. J. Differential Geom. 83 (2009), no. 2, 377‚Äì405. Additionally, Lott showed that if a Riemannian manifold with smooth density arises as a collapsed limit of Riemannian manifolds with an uniform upper bound on diameter and sectional curvature and a uniform lower bound on Ricci curvature, then the lower bound on Ricci curvature is preserved in the limit as a lower bound on Bakry-√âmery's Ricci curvature. In this sense, the Bakry-√âmery Ricci tensor is shown to be natural in the context of Riemannian convergence theory. In 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman posted two papers to the arXiv which claimed to provide a proof for William Thurston's geometrization conjecture, using Richard Hamilton's theory of Ricci flow.Perelman, Grisha. The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications. Perelman, Grisha. Ricci flow with surgery on three- manifolds. Perelman's papers attracted immediate attention for their bold claims and the fact that some of their results were quickly verified. However, due to Perelman's abbreviated style of presentation of highly technical material, many mathematicians were unable to understand much of his work, especially in his second paper. Beginning in 2003, Lott and Bruce Kleiner posted a series of annotations of Perelman's work to their websites, which was finalized in a 2008 publication.Kleiner, Bruce; Lott, John Notes on Perelman's papers. Geom. Topol. 12 (2008), no. 5, 2587‚Äì2855. Their article was most recently updated in 2013, to fix an incorrect statement of Hamilton's compactness theorem. In 2015, Kleiner and Lott were awarded the Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences of the United States for their work. Other well-known expositions of Perelman's work are due to Huai-Dong Cao and Xi-Ping Zhu, and to John Morgan and Gang Tian.Cao, Huai- Dong; Zhu, Xi-Ping. A complete proof of the Poincar√© and geometrization conjectures‚Äîapplication of the Hamilton-Perelman theory of the Ricci flow. Asian J. Math. 10 (2006), no. 2, 165‚Äì492.Morgan, John; Tian, Gang. Ricci flow and the Poincar√© conjecture. Clay Mathematics Monographs, 3. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI; Clay Mathematics Institute, Cambridge, MA, 2007. xlii+521 pp. In 2005, Max-K. von Renesse and Karl-Theodor Sturm showed that the a lower bound of the Ricci curvature on a Riemannian manifold could be characterized by optimal transportation, in particular by the convexity of a certain \\"entropy\\" functional along geodesics of the associated Wasserstein metric space.von Renesse, Max-K.; Sturm, Karl-Theodor. Transport inequalities, gradient estimates, entropy, and Ricci curvature. Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 58 (2005), no. 7, 923‚Äì940. In 2009, Lott and C√©dric Villani capitalized upon this equivalence to define a notion of \\"lower bound for Ricci curvature\\" for a general class of metric spaces equipped with Borel measures. Similar work was done at the same time by Sturm, with the accumulated results typically referred to as \\"Lott-Sturm-Villani theory\\".Sturm, Karl-Theodor On the geometry of metric measure spaces. I. Acta Math. 196 (2006), no. 1, 65‚Äì131.Sturm, Karl-Theodor On the geometry of metric measure spaces. II. Acta Math. 196 (2006), no. 1, 133‚Äì177. The papers of Lott-Villani and Sturm have initiated a very large amount of research in the mathematical literature, much of which is centered around extending classical work on Riemannian geometry to the setting of metric measure spaces.Ambrosio, Luigi; Gigli, Nicola; Savar√©, Giuseppe. Metric measure spaces with Riemannian Ricci curvature bounded from below. Duke Math. J. 163 (2014), no. 7, 1405‚Äì1490.Ambrosio, Luigi; Gigli, Nicola; Savar√©, Giuseppe.

On the equivalence of the entropic curvature-dimension condition and Bochner's inequality on metric measure spaces. Invent. Math. 201 (2015), no. 3, 993‚Äì1071. An essentially analogous program for sectional curvature bounds (from either below or above) was initiated in the 1990s by a highly influential article of Yuri Burago, Mikhail Gromov, and Grigori Perelman, following foundations laid in the 1950s by Aleksandr Aleksandrov.Burago, Yu.; Gromov, M.; Perel πman, G.

Early life and education Born in Manhattan, New York City, Calissi spent his early years in an orphanage in Kearny, New Jersey. Offered a college scholarship, he chose to decline it so that he could earn a living and graduated in 1941 from John Marshall Law School.Kihss, Peter. \\"Guy W.

Career He was elected as Mayor of Wood-Ridge, New Jersey in 1947 and served in that position until 1954, when Governor of New Jersey Robert B. Meyner named him as Bergen County prosecutor, the first Democrat in decades to serve in that position. In a 1964 case that was later overturned, Calissi placed a ban on the sale of the John Cleland book Fanny Hill in New Jersey. New Jersey Superior Court judge Morris Pashman upheld the ban, calling the book \\"sufficiently obscene to forfeit the protection of the First Amendment of the Constitution.\\" In addition to failing tests of \\"social value\\", \\"prurient interest\\" and \\"patently offensive\\", Pashman ruled that Fanny Hill failed the \\"hard-core pornography test\\", noting that the \\"book may be well-written but still obscene\\".Waggoner, Walter H. \\"FANNY HILL' SALE BANNED IN JERSEY; Judge Rules Its Obscenity 'Forfeits' Protection\\", The New York Times, December 8, 1964.

At a second trial, in June 1971, Smith accepted a deal under which he would plead guilty to second degree murder and be released on parole. Thomas Trantino was convicted in 1964 for the murder of two Lodi, New Jersey police officers and sentenced to the electric chair, but his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment following the decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1972 to invalidate death sentences. Trantino ultimately spent 38 years in the prison system, and was not released on parole until 2002, after he had become the longest-serving inmate in the New Jersey penal system.

It owes its name to this goal \\"The seuil (threshold) is the whole excitement of parting and arriving. It is also the brand new threshold that we refashion at the door of the Church to allow entry to many whose foot gropes around it\\" (Jean Plaquevent, letter dated 28 December 1934).Herv√© Serry, Les √âditions du Seuil : 70 ans d'histoire, Seuil, 2007, p. 15  Description  √âditions du Seuil was the publisher of the Don Camillo series, and of Chairman Mao Zedong's Little Red Book. The large sales that these generated have allowed the house to publish more specialized titles, particularly in the social sciences. Seuil is widely respected in the publishing world, maintaining good relations with its authors. Seuil has published works by Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes and Philippe Sollers (in his first period), and later by Edgar Morin, Maurice Genevoix and Pierre Bourdieu. Notably, they published Frantz Fanon's doctoral thesis, Black Skin, White Masks, in 1952, and the first edition of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago (in Russian as –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–ø–µ–ª–∞–≥ –ì–£–õ–ê–ì) in 1973. Similarly, Seuil's good relations with book retailers have allowed it to establish significant distribution activity, ensuring the circulation of the works of such publishers as Odile Jacob, √âditions de Minuit, Jos√© Corti, and Rivages. √âditions du Seuil has also performed significant activities in children's literature. The house has promoted and published many great French children's authors; in 2005 √âditions du Seuil was the first to offer to the public animated films included in their albums that were produced by the artists themselves, such as √Ä Quai by Sara and Promenade d'un distrait, by B√©atrice Alemagna.  History  In 1937, √âditions du Seuil was bought by Paul Flamand and Jean Bardet. In 1979 these two left the direction to Michel Chodkiewicz. The leadership was subsequently ensured by Claude Cherki from 1989. Cherki was involved in the purchase of Seuil by La Martini√®re on 12 January 2004. Six months later he was obliged to resign as a result of his interest in this operation. Cherki was replaced by Pascal Flamand (Pr√©sident-directeur g√©n√©ral) and Olivier Cohen (publishing director). The latter created a subsidiary called L'Olivier. Following the purchase by La Martini√®re, the Volumen distribution company was created. Numerous logistical problems arose, and several editors left the publishing house. In November 2005, √âditions du Seuil announced the arrival of Laure Adler to oversee its literature department. Olivier took back control of his publishing house L'Olivier. Points, a pocket subsidiary of Seuil, became a publisher in its own right. The house continued its policy of growth, amalgamating the publishers Danger Public and Petit √† petit. Significant tension developed and in 2006 the editor Herv√© Hamon (who had a loyal record of 20 publications with Seuil in the capacity of an author) left, declaring that the author was no longer at the centre of the operation.

Its aim is to support teaching of process algebras. Systems are described as process algebra terms that are then mapped to labeled transition systems (LTSs). Properties can be verified by checking equivalences between concrete and abstract system descriptions or by model checking temporal formulas (expressed as Œº-calculus or ACTL) over the obtained LTS. A key feature of TAPAs that makes it particularly suited for teaching is that it maintains a consistent graphical and textual representation of each system. After a change in the graphic notation, the textual representation is updated immediately; but after textual modifications, the update of the graphical representation has to be manually triggered. In TAPAs, concurrent systems are described by means of processes, which are nondeterministic descriptions of system behaviors, and process systems, which are obtained by process compositions. Notably, processes can be defined in terms of other processes or process systems. Processes and process systems are composed by using the operators of a given process algebra. Currently, TAPAs supports two process algebras: CCSP and PEPA. CCSP (= CCS + CSP) is obtained from CCS by considering some operators of CSP. After creating a CCSP process system, the user can analyze it using one of the following tools. *Equivalence Checker: allows to compare pairs of automata using a choice of equivalence (bisimulation, branching bisimulation, or decorated traces) *Model checker: given a model of a system, test automatically whether this model meets a given specification * Simulator: following one possible execution path through the system and presenting the resulting execution trace to the user. PEPA (Performance Evaluation Process Algebra) is a stochastic process algebra designed for modeling computer and communication systems introduced by Jane Hillston in the 1990s. The language extends classical process algebras such as Milner's CCS and Hoare's CSP by introducing probabilistic branching and timing of transitions. Rates are drawn from the exponential distribution and PEPA models are finite state, so they give rise to a stochastic process---specifically a continuous-time Markov process (CTMC). Thus the language can be used to study quantitative properties of models of computer and communication systems such as throughput, utilization and response time as well as qualitative properties such as freedom from deadlock. The language is formally defined using a structured operational semantics in the style invented by Gordon Plotkin. TAPAS is the result of collective work, beginning in 1990 with a tool named JACK by IEI CNR of Pisa. The work was continued by ISTI-CNR of Pisa. The new TAPAs version was developed at the Dipartimento Sistemi ed Informatica of the University of Florence. See also * List of Model Checking Tools * Model checking * Temporal logics References *F.

Background  Lautsprecher Teufel develops and manufacturers audio devices (including PC, Home cinema, THX, Stereo, Music streaming, Bluetooth, and headphone products). Teufel is the leader in Internet-based speaker sales companies in Europe and is the largest company for THX speakers worldwide. The company was started in 1980 by Peter Tschimmel, a self-confessed audiophile, in his home town of Berlin. Teufel's headquarters, including the customer service, product development and marketing departments, is ever since located in Berlin, while their warehouse and shipping section is based in Hamburg.  Home audio lines  Teufel Power HiFi THX‚Äì Teufel was the first producer of THX-certified speakers in Germany, beginning their line in 1996. Today Teufel has the widest selection of THX certified speaker systems in the world. Teufel creates speakers that are THX, THX Select 2 and Ultra 2 certified. An example of an Ultra 2 certified system is the System 8 THX Ultra 2. This system decreased the size of its subwoofer casing by two thirds from the previous model.  Teufel Streaming  Raumfeld streaming technology creates audio streaming solutions that, together with Teufel acoustics, allow one to connect their HiFi sound system to the Internet; giving access to over 50,000 international and local radio stations, Napster and one‚Äôs own personal music collection. This system wirelessly connects a sound system that can be located in one or multiple rooms. After this acquisition, Teufel began selling Raumfeld enabled products throughout Europe from their Internet platform. Teufel Raumfeld has been met with much popularity, being given 5 out of 5 from What HiFi (May, 2010). PC Pro states ‚ÄúThe speakers are the key differentiator in a Raumfeld system. Rather than building the wireless technology into a discrete amplifier or streaming module as Sonos does, Raumfeld builds it all directly into one of the speakers, along with a 30W per channel amplifier.‚Äù (August, 2010). In June 2011, Teufel came out with a Raumfeld app that can be used with iPhones, iPads and iPods as an additional remote control. This was followed by the release of an App for Android devices in January 2012.  Home cinema  Teufel Audio's collection of home cinema products includes over 45 micro, compact, column and floor systems. Though Teufel already had a strong footing in the home cinema market, their popularity skyrocketed in spring 2004 with the launch of the Concept S. This system was the first affordable, high-quality aluminium column speaker set to hit the market. At that time, Teufel sold the Concept S for 650 Euros, while other, similar products were sold from 900 to 1500 Euros. Though the Concept S is no longer on the market, its successor, the Columa 300, is.  PC speakers  Teufel made its appearance in the world of multimedia sound in 2006 with the creation of the Concept C multimedia speaker set. The line of Concept C speaker systems offers a wide variety of systems, with some connectable via USB cable or wirelessly. A similar product to the Concept C is Teufel's Concept E PC speaker line. These systems are 5.1 multimedia sets that generally include one centre speaker, four satellite speakers and one subwoofer. The Concept E also comes in a digital form which connects to most media players, such as one's computer, DVD player, game console, DVB-T and Satellite receiver, TV, video recorder, MP3 player, Discman, Walkman, CD, DJ mixer, etc...

She was President of the Lazio region and was formerly Secretary General of the General Labour Union (UGL); she resigned on 24 September 2012 after an expense scandal.The Guardian: Governor resigns amid scandal Biography At the end of her studies and after an apprenticeship in the Cisnal Agriculture Trade Union Federation, she became a member of the Confederal press office. After two years, she was assigned by Cisnal to lead the administrative and organizational department. From 1994 her job became more political, she played a central role in organising the transition of Cisnal to UGL, which happened during the 1996 Congress. She started reforms in terms of representativeness in the public sector and in the reorganization of social assistance services of the Trade Union. In 1998, she entered into the internal structure of the UGL, the Confederal Secretariat. In the same year she became UGL representative within the European Economic and Social Committee. She spent time in between Rome and Brussels and campaigned on improving health and safety in the workplace. In 1999 she was appointed as Deputy Secretary-General UGL and General Secretary of the Private Services Trade Union Federation. In support of women involved in the organization, she created the UGL Women Coordination. She was involved in major disputes in the national chemical industry (Eni), in the metal workers sector (Fiat and Thyssen Krupp), in public employment, in the transport sector (Railways and Alitalia) and in the private services sector. She worked to reach agreements with the Prodi, D'Alema and Berlusconi governments, and contributed to all the major reforms of labour market (Law nr. 30 of 2003) and pension system, in order to defend employees interests. In February 2006 she was elected as (with 96.7% of votes) Secretary General of UGL, first woman in Italy to lead a Trade Union confederation. In late 2009 she brought herself forward as candidate for the presidency of the Lazio Region, in view of the elections of 29 March 2010. She led a centre-right coalition, which was however reduced when its main party, the People of Freedom led by Berlusconi, was excluded from elections in the Province of Rome for some formal errors . In March 2010 she won the election as president of the Lazio region in a close race against Emma Bonino. Bonino is known as a pro-choice activist, while Polverini was against abortion rights and thus received support from Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, President of the Italian Episcopal Conference.Regionali, Bonino: Bagnasco fuori luogo Polverini: Chiesa √® fonte autorevole She resigned on 24 September 2012, after a controversy regarding the personal use of public money at the hand of some members of the coalition that supported her.

See also: It is within Lighthouse Park at the northern tip of Roosevelt Island in the East River. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1972 and was designated a New York City Landmark on March 23, 1976. History Blackwell Island (known as Welfare Island from 1921 to 1973; now Roosevelt Island) is located in the middle of the East River, within the modern borough of Manhattan. The island was purchased by the city government in 1828. Various facilities on the island were built including a penitentiary, almshouse, city hospital, the New York Lunatic Asylum, and the Smallpox Hospital. In 1872, the City of New York built a lighthouse. The supervising architect was James Renwick, Jr., who also designed several other buildings on the island for the Charities and Correction Board as well as more famous works such as St. Patrick's Cathedral. Legends abound about the construction of the lighthouse. Two names, John McCarthy and Thomas Maxey, are associated with the various legends. The 1870 report of the warden of the lunatic asylum indicated that an industrious patient had built a seawall near the Asylum that had reclaimed land. The legends indicate that an inmate of the asylum built a fort to defend the island against a British invasion that he feared. Some versions indicate that he had incorporated Civil War cannons. The legend indicates that the builder was bribed with bogus money to demolish the fort for the construction of the lighthouse. Other stories indicate that an Asylum inmate constructed the lighthouse. For many years, a saying was inscribed on a stone near the lighthouse: Blackwell Island Light in 1970 > This is the work > Was done by > John McCarthy > Who built the Light > House from the bottom to the > Top All ye who do pass by may > Pray for his soul when he dies. The lighthouse was operated by the City instead of the U.S. Lighthouse Board. In its 1893 annual report, the Lighthouse Board generally praised the operations of Blackwell Island Lighthouse, but indicated that the Board had been unfairly criticized because of the City's occasional failure to keep the light in operation. The Board advocated banning private lights. The 1917 U.S. Coast Pilot indicated that there was a private light at the north end of the island. The light was operated until about 1940. In the 1970s, the lighthouse was partially restored. The restoration was completed in 1998. Architecture The lighthouse is approximately tall. It is constructed of gray gneiss, rough ashlar that was quarried on the island by inmates from the penitentiary. It has an octagonal base and an octagonal shaft. There is an entrance on the south side under a projecting gable and a pointed Gothic arch. Two south-facing slit windows in the shaft light the interior. At the top of the shaft there is a band of ornamented corbels below the gallery, which is surrounded by an iron railing. The lantern is octagonal with a shallow conical roof. An 1893 photograph and a 1903 movie show that it probably had a much taller, steeper conical cap when it was built. The optics were provided by the U.S. Lighthouse Board.

Family background and early career Wilson was born on 18 February 1859, the second son of Lieut-Col Fuller Maitland Wilson of Stowlangtoft Hall, Suffolk. The Second World War commander Field Marshal 'Jumbo' Wilson was his nephew.Burke‚Äôs 'Wilson'.

That year he became adjutant of his battalion, and was promoted to captain in 1884.Army List. On 29 April 1884 Wilson married Charlotte Elise Gough (died 17 August 1942), the daughter of Maj-Gen Sir Hugh Gough, VC, of the Bengal Army. The Great War commanders General Sir Hubert Gough and Brigadier-General Sir John Gough, were her cousins.Burke‚Äôs 'Wilson'; Farrar-Hockley, Goughie. In 1887, shortly after he took command of the Lahore Division, Sir Hugh appointed his son-in-law as his aide-de-camp.India List 1888. Home service and South Africa Wilson returned to regimental duty after two years, and in 1892 was appointed adjutant of 5th Bn Rifle Brigade. This was a Militia battalion, previously the Queen's Own Royal Tower Hamlets Light Infantry (2nd Tower Hamlets Militia) based in Bethnal Green in the East End of London. He was promoted to major in 1895. Wilson transferred to 1st Bn Rifle Brigade in time to serve in the Second Boer War. He was in the campaign to relieve Ladysmith, including the battles of Colenso, Vaal Krantz and Pieter's Hill. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel and received two mentions in despatches for his services.London Gazette 22 February & 10 September 1901. Wilson then became second-in-command of 4th Bn Rifle Brigade in Dublin, but was back in South Africa with the battalion for the final operations in the Orange Free State in early 1902,Hart‚Äôs Army List; Army List for which he received a further mention in despatches.London Gazette 29 July 1901 After peace was declared in May 1902, he left South Africa on board the SS Bavarian and arrived in the United Kingdom the following month. Wilson became a regimental lieutenant-colonel in November 1902 and took command of 2nd Bn Rifle Brigade, in which his nephew Henry Maitland Wilson was a junior officer. Between 1902 and 1907 the battalion was stationed in Egypt, Aden, and India.Army List Wilson was promoted brevet colonel in 1904 and full colonel in 1907. After completing his five-year period of command, he was appointed assistant adjutant general of the South Army in India, in the grade of GSO1. He was awarded the companionship of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1910.London Gazette 24 June 1901 Wilson went on half-pay in 1911 but the following year came back onto full pay as a temporary brigadier-general with the appointment as General Officer Commanding (GOC) 12th Infantry Brigade, based at Dover.Hart‚Äôs Army List First World War France and Flanders 12th Brigade formed part of 4th Division of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), ready to go overseas in the event of hostilities. When the European War broke out in August 1914, the 4th Division proceeded to France as soon as its coastal defence duties could be handed over. The division arrived at the front on 26 August, hungry, wet and weary after a night march, and was rushed into action at the Battle of Le Cateau.Official History: France and Belgium 1914, Vol. I, pp. 143, 166‚Äì7. Wilson's 12th Bde was taken by surprise and suffered heavy casualties, but rallied and held the extreme left of the British line until the BEF was able to retreat.Terraine, pp. 133-4. On 9 September the commander of 4th Division was disabled by an accident and Wilson took over as acting GOC, leading it at the crossing of the Aisne on 13‚Äì14 September.Official History: France and Belgium 1914, Vol. I, pp. 379, 387, 412‚Äì3. The BEF next moved to the Ypres sector, 4th Division detraining at St Omer and taking part in the Battle of Armentieres. Influenced by his sluggish corps commander, Pulteney, Wilson did not push on, and even withdrew a battalion that was making good progress, but he did eventually secure the crossings of the River Lys and the town of Armentieres.Farrar-Hockley, Ypres 1914, pp. 59‚Äì69. Wilson's promotion to major-general was notified on 26 October, and he was confirmed in command of 4th Division.Official History: France and Belgium 1914, Vol. II, p. 252. During the 1st Battle of Messines on 1 November, 4th Division's rifle fire held off an attack by the German Guard Cavalry Division ordered personally by the Kaiser, and did not need to retire to positions that had been prepared in the rear. The division continued to hold its line in front of Ploegsteert ('Plug Street') Wood for the duration of the 1st Battle of Ypres.Official History: France and Belgium 1914, Vol. II, pp. 71, 106-14, 252, 354‚Äì5, 402‚Äì3. When the German gas attack initiated the 2nd Battle of Ypres on 22 April 1915, 4th Division was in GHQ (General Headquarters) Reserve, and over the following days parts of it were sent up piecemeal to reinforce the Canadian Division, plug gaps in the line, and take part in the counter-attacks around Kitchener's Wood. It was not until 4 May that Wilson was able to reassemble his division to relieve the Canadians ‚Äì parts of it had been assigned to six different divisions.Official History: France and Belgium 1915, Vol. I, pp. 282, 287, 302, 323, 246. Wilson was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in June that year,London Gazette 23 June 1915. and in September was promoted to temporary lieutenant-general as GOC of the newly organised XII Corps.Official History: France and Belgium 1915, Vol. II, p. 87. Salonika In November 1915, XII Corps was sent from France with 22nd, 26th and 28th Divisions under command to reinforce Allied forces on the Macedonian front. Wilson and his corps headquarters (HQ) arrived at the port of Salonika on 12 November, but the commander of the British Salonika Force (BSF) took Wilson's staff to establish his own HQ,Official History: Macedonia, Vol. I, p. 58. and Wilson was left unemployed for a month. On 14 December 1915 the War Office sanctioned the establishment of two corps within the BSF and Wilson reformed XII Corps.Wakefield & Moody, p.45; Official History: Macedonia, Vol. I, p. 95. After a period holding the defensive position known as 'the Birdcage' around Salonika, XII Corps moved up-country in July 1916, taking over former French positions, but only part of Wilson's command was involved in the fighting during the summer and autumn.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 48‚Äì58; Official History: Macedonia, Vol. I, pp. 155, 188. Wilson was ordered to prepare an attack on the Bulgarian positions west of Lake Doiran in April 1917.Official History, Macedonia, Vol I, p. 295. The area to be attacked was 'a defender's dream, being a tangled mass of hills cut by numerous ravines'.Wakefield & Moody p. 65. Wilson planned a three-stage operation to capture the three lines of defences, preceded by a short intense bombardment. The BSF's commander, Sir George Milne decided that his manpower was too limited, and reduced Wilson's plan to a smaller assault on the first defence line only, preceded by a three-day bombardment to neutralise enemy batteries and destroy trenches and barbed wire. This of course lost the element of surprise in Wilson's plan, but the Bulgarians were well aware of what was coming. Only three brigades were engaged, but the casualties were high and little ground was gained. Despite Wilson's misgivings, Milne ordered a second attack two weeks later. The assault troops managed to cross no man's land, but it was difficult to get information back to HQs, and some companies simply disappeared.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 65‚Äì98;Official History: Macedonia, Vol I, pp. 306‚Äì319. This 1st Battle of Doiran (second battle by Bulgarian reckoning) had been a failure, and with many troops being withdrawn to other theatres, Wilson and XII Corps did not get another opportunity to launch a major attack until 18 September 1918. On that day, with two brigades of 22nd Division and the Greek Seres Division, XII Corps failed to take 'Pip Ridge' and the 'Grande Couronne'. Again Wilson advised Milne against an immediate resumption of the attack. The following day he attacked with a brigade from 27th Division supported by the remnants of 22nd Division, the Seres Division, and the French 2nd Regiment of Zouaves. Once more the attack failed with heavy casualties, and at 11.00 Wilson informed Milne that nothing would be gained by continuing the fight.Wakefield & Moody pp. 196‚Äì219; Official History: Macedonia, Vol II, pp. 163‚Äì178. However, the 2nd Battle of Doiran had served its purpose by drawing Bulgarian attention away from Gen Franchet d‚ÄôEsperey's main Franco- Serbian thrust, which broke through the Bulgarian lines further west. On 21 September the downcast men of the BSF were stunned to be ordered to pursue the retreating Bulgarians, with XII Corps in the lead. Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 29 September, but the BSF continued to advance across Bulgaria towards the Turkish frontier, until the Ottoman Turks also signed the Armistice of Mudros on 31 October.Wakefield & Moody pp. 220‚Äì227.

Did You See...? was a long-running British television review programme that began on the BBC2 in 1980. The programme took a look back at the week's television with a discussion between the presenter and three guests. In the first run there was also a pre-filmed last segment on an aspect of TV by an independent reporter.. The presenters of Did You See...? were the journalist and broadcaster Sir Ludovic Kennedy, who fronted the programme from 1980 to 1988,David Steel Obituary: Sir Ludovic Kennedy, The Guardian, 19 October 2009 and from 1991 to 1993 Jeremy Paxman. Sarah Dunant hosted the show while Kennedy was absent due to ill health. The format was to review the week's TV highlights, followed by an in depth review and critique of three selected shows with a panel of three public figures (not necessarily 'celebrities'). Significant editions of Did You See...? include a 1986 edition which featured a look at the history of Blue Peter in which former presenter Peter Purves recalled that on the death of Blue Peter pet parrot Joey, the show's editor Biddy Baxter called him in floods of tears. He speculated that had he himself died, Baxter would have been far less upset and would not have been likely to be calling his co-presenters telling them that he had died. This particular feature was one of several that was later expanded and extracted from the series, shown in a stand-alone documentary format. Sea of Faith, a 1984 documentary series examining the history of Christianity in the modern world, was featured on another edition. Several of the features were dedicated to Doctor Who. In 1982, there was an item on The Cybermen, to mark their first appearance in the series in seven years. A later feature took a general look at monsters from the series.

Jay Silverheels, a member of the Mohawk Aboriginal people in Canada, played The Lone Ranger's Indian companion Tonto. John Hart replaced Moore in the title role from 1952 to 1953 owing to a contract dispute. Fred Foy, who had been both narrator and announcer of the radio series from 1948 until its ending, was the announcer. Gerald Mohr was originally employed as the narrator for the television series, but story narration was dropped after 16 episodes. The Lone Ranger was the highest-rated television program on ABC in the early 1950s and its first true \\"hit\\". The series finished number 7 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1950‚Äì1951 season, number 18 for 1951‚Äì1952 and number 29 for 1952‚Äì1953. Series premise The fictional story line maintains that a patrol of six Texas Rangers is massacred, with only one member surviving. The \\"lone\\" survivor thereafter disguises himself with a black mask and travels with Tonto throughout Texas and the American West to assist those challenged by the lawless elements. A silver mine supplies The Lone Ranger with the name of his horse as well as the funds required to finance his wandering lifestyle and the raw material for his signature bullets. At the end of most episodes, after the Lone Ranger and Tonto leave, someone asks the sheriff or other person of authority who the masked man was. The person then responds that it was the Lone Ranger, who is then heard yelling \\"Hi-Yo Silver, away!\\" as he and Tonto ride away on their horses. Production George W. Trendle retained the title of producer, although he recognized that his experience in radio was not adequate for producing the television series. For this, he hired veteran MGM film producer Jack Chertok. Chertok served as the producer for the first 182 episodes. The first 78 episodes were produced and broadcast for 78 consecutive weeks without any breaks or reruns. Then the entire 78 episodes were shown again before any new episodes were produced. All were shot in Kanab, Utah and California. Much of the series was filmed on the former Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California, including the iconic opening sequence to each episode, in which the cry of \\"Hi-yo Silver\\" is heard before the Lone Ranger and Silver gallop to a distinctive rock and Silver rears up on his hind legs. The rock seen next to Silver is known as Lone Ranger Rock and remains in place today on the site of the former movie ranch. When it came time to produce another batch of 52 episodes, there is speculation of a wage dispute with Clayton Moore (although he stated in his autobiography \\"I Was That Masked Man\\" that he never really knew exactly why he was dismissed), and John Hart was hired to play the role of the Lone Ranger. Once again, the 52 new episodes were aired in sequence followed by 52 weeks rerunning them. Despite expectations that the mask would make the switch workable, Hart was not accepted in the role, and his episodes were not seen again until the 1980s. At the end of the fifth year of the television series, Trendle sold the Lone Ranger rights to Jack Wrather, who bought them on August 3, 1954. Wrather immediately rehired Clayton Moore to play the Lone Ranger, and another 52 episodes were produced. Once again, they were broadcast as a full year of new episodes followed by a full year of reruns. The final season saw a number of changes, including an episode count of 39, which had become the industry standard. Wrather invested money from his own pocket to film in color, although ABC telecast only in black and white. Wrather also went outdoors for action footage. Otherwise, the series was mostly filmed on a studio sound stage. Another big change, not readily detectable by the viewers, was replacing Jack Chertok with producer Sherman A. Harris. By this time, Chertok had established his own television production company and was busy producing other programs. Wrather decided not to negotiate further with the network and took the property to the big screen and canceled television production. The last new episode of the color series was broadcast on June 6, 1957, and the series ended September 12, 1957, although ABC reaped the benefits of daytime reruns for several more years. Wrather's company produced two modestly budgeted theatrical features, The Lone Ranger (1956) and The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold (1958). The cast included former child actress Bonita Granville, who had married Wrather after his divorce from a daughter of former Texas Governor W. Lee O'Daniel.

The novel concerns the Mau Mau liberation struggle during the latter days of British colonial rule and attempts, by the actions of the main protagonists, to show how Mau Mau was organized and why it took so long for the colonial government to defeat them.Encyclopedia of African Literature published by Routledge of London in 2003 ] Carcase for Hounds received mixed reviews. The novel was also adapted into a movie by Ola Balogun, Cry Freedom (1981; not to be confused with the more famous 1987 film of the same name). Plot The novel concerns the conflict between the fictional General Haraka, a leader of the Mau Mau, and British forces representing the colonial government, led by Captain Kingsley. Haraka is a former village chief whose disagreement with Kingsley, before the conflict, causes him to consider rebelling against the British. It is set primarily in remote portions of Kenya, where the fighting took place in rain forests and on mountains. Reception The novel received mixed reviews by critics. J. Burns, writing for the journal Books Abroad, criticized the book for being largely action, with only superficial plot and characters. Burns did, however, praise Mwangi's prose and descriptive abilities. G. D. Killam criticized the book for reasons similar to Burns, faulting the shallow development of characters others than those involved in the top hierarchy of respective the British and rebel forces. To the contrary, Charles R. Larson, also writing for Books Abroad, said that the fact that the novel alternates between the perspective of the Mau Mau and the British forces, which Charles R. Larson, also writing for Books Abroad, said contributed to a well-thought out and fast-paced plot.

Construction (1) Wavelength selection, (2) Printer button, (3) Concentration factor adjustment, (4) UV mode selector (Deuterium lamp), (5) Readout, (6) Sample compartment, (7) Zero control (100% T), (8) Sensitivity switch, (9)ON/OFF switchColorimetry The essential parts of a colorimeter are: * a light source (often an ordinary low-voltage filament lamp); * an adjustable aperture; * a set of colored filters; * a cuvette to hold the working solution; * a detector (usually a photoresistor) to measure the transmitted light; * a meter to display the output from the detector. In addition, there may be: * a voltage regulator, to protect the instrument from fluctuations in mains voltage; * a second light path, cuvette and detector. This enables comparison between the working solution and a \\"blank\\", consisting of pure solvent, to improve accuracy. There are many commercialized colorimeters as well as open source versions with construction documentation for education and for research. Anzalone GC, Glover AG, Pearce JM. Open-Source Colorimeter. Sensors (2013); 13(4):5338-5346 Filters Changeable optics filters are used in the colorimeter to select the wavelength which the solute absorbs the most, in order to maximize accuracy. The usual wavelength range is from 400 to 700 nm. If it is necessary to operate in the ultraviolet range then some modifications to the colorimeter are needed. In modern colorimeters the filament lamp and filters may be replaced by several (light-emitting diode) of different colors. The Measurement of Colour. Cuvettes In a manual colorimeter the cuvettes are inserted and removed by hand. An automated colorimeter (as used in an AutoAnalyzer) is fitted with a flowcell through which solution flows continuously. Output The output from a colorimeter may be displayed by an analogue or digital meter and may be shown as transmittance (a linear scale from 0-100%) or as absorbance (a logarithmic scale from zero to infinity). The useful range of the absorbance scale is from 0-2 but it is desirable to keep within the range 0-1 because, above 1, the results become unreliable due to scattering of light. In addition, the output may be sent to a chart recorder, data logger, or computer. Notes References *The Nuffield Foundation 2003. March 30, 2003. *\\"Colour.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

He is the founder of a unique method that revolutionised the Romanian school of acting.according to Victor Rebengiuc, Mircea Albulescu, Dan Puric, Gelu Colceag, Florin Zamfirescu and Adrian Titieni: http://www.mediafax.ro/cultura-media/doliu-in-lumea- teatrului-5008432/, http://www.mediafax.ro/printare/5008432/, http://m.stirileprotv.ro/index.php?article_id=3207787, http://www.cronicavip.ro/cronicavip/article.php?article_id=63920, http://www.realitatea.net/a-murit-actorul-si-regizorul-ion-cojar_643566.html, http://yorick.ro/adrian-titieni-nu-avem-o-radiografie-a-valorilor-corecta/Ion Cojar on IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1486212/ Ion Cojar as acting teacher Ion Cojar changed the old way of understanding acting in Romania, when the actor was taught how to play theatre, to act, to fake, imitate or mimic life, emotions or characters, with a new one that demands actors, directors and teachers to create the circumstances in which the truth of life can occur, and the actor/actress to go onstage or during filming through authentic psychologically-realistic processes that cannot be anticipated or consciously controlled, at the end of which he/she would be actually changed as a person, so that the audiences may be able to follow the lifelike processes, to understand and believe what they see and hear, to empathize with the actors.http://revistateatrul.cimec.ro/listaAutor.asp?IndexS=C&NumeS;=Cojar0Ion Ion Cojar argued that in order to have an authentic performance, the actor's psycho-emotional processes, along with his speech, body movements and physiological changes, which are the results of those processes, must not be anticipated, because this way they would be anchored in preconceived ideas and would not be new and authentic, and also must not be consciously controlled, because we cannot observe our own processes as they are taking place without interrupting them. In everyday life we never know what is going to happen or how we are going to behave or what we are going to say when we interact with someone. We just try to change something in that person in order to achieve our goal. In the same way, the actor, in a certain life situation and with a certain psychology that were previously assumed, aims to actually change something in his partner in order to achieve his goal (his character's goal that he previously assumed), without anticipating any obstacles, by venturing into the unknown and allowing himself the freedom to make mistakes. This way, everything that will happen to him in the process, from emotions to body movements to speech, will come organically, without being consciously controlled or anticipated, and this way they will be authentic, just like in everyday life, and thus the audiences will understand and believe what they'll see and hear and will empathize with the actor. Ion Cojar also argued that we can know for sure that the actor is not faking or acting, but is going through an authentic process when we see instant, organic changes in the color and texture of his face, like when blood instantly floods its vessels in important moments, because these changes are impossible to fake. As a professor and researcher at The National University of Theatre and Film from Bucharest, guided by the principle \\"process, not success\\", Ion Cojar worked with his students in order for them to develop a specific psycho-emotional mechanism that, along with the use of a specific acting method, would allow them to easily transform conventions in life truth (conventions like fictional and imaginary life situations, given plot and lines, a character's personality and goal etc.), unlike the old acting school when students were taught how to play theatre. Ion Cojar always said that \\"the art of the actor has nothing in common with theatre\\",http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/arta-actorului-daca- nu.html a statement that became his trademark. The professional actors who were trained via Cojar's pedagogical method tend to use in their creative processes an acting method derived from the previous one. One of his former students, Luminita Gheorghiu, won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress with her performance in The Death of Mr. Lazarescu (2005).Luminita Gheorghiu on IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315640/ Professor Mircea Gheorghiu, another former student of Ion Cojar, is considered to be the main continuator of his teaching method in the art of the actor.Mircea Gheorghiu on IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3993998/http://academytv.ro/team-view/michael- freeman/ Adrian »öofei, a former student of Mircea Gheorgiu, won the Special Jury Prize for Best Actor at the 2016 Nashville Film Festival for his performance in Be My Cat: A Film for Anne. In parallel with the development of his method, Ion Cojar supported an educational system in which the students are not taught or modeled by the teachers, but in which the environment is that of laboratory experimentation and self-knowledge, of despecialization and deliverance from preconceptions acquired in family, school and society, an environment in which the student is able to become aware of and to use his/her full native creative potential that makes him/her unique. In theory, Ion Cojar gathered all his research and discoveries in his book entitled \\"O poeticƒÉ a artei actorului\\" (\\"Poetics of the actor's art\\"). Ion Cojar as theatre director As a theatre director, Ion Cojar also argued that the audiences, in order to empathize in a total way with what they're seeing and hearing, must not have any clue or the impression that they're witnessing a theatre show, but a genuine life event. He aimed to make theatre shows that paradoxically don't look like shows at all, where the audiences would find no elements whatsoever to indicate that they are witnessing a theatre show and not an actual life event.

They are best known for their claim to be the rightful keepers of Saint Fillan's holy relics; especially the Stone (Ferg). Dewar Origins The name of Dewar or Dewere like most Scottish surnames has evolved through the centuries and in many variations. Sometime known as Deoir, Doire or Deoireach as derived from the ancient Jore, the name Deuchars is also believed by many to be a variation of Dewar and in the Western Isles, Dewar was sometimes referred to as Mac gillie dheodradha (son of the Dewar's lad). Indeed, two families bearing that name in Skye simplified this to Macleora (also known as MacClure) and Macindeor and in many documents it was a common practice to refer to an individual by both his known names, for example ‚ÄòDeoir or Dewere‚Äô where the spelling and recording of either was determined only by the pronunciation and writing skills of the author. Dewar is certainly derived from the ancient Gaelic descriptive word 'deoir' meaning stranger, pilgrim or wanderer. However, there is a title and office of 'dewar' from the 'deoradh' that has early 11th-century origins and being normally attributed to that of 'relic keeper' or ‚Äòcustodian‚Äô mostly associated with Saint Fillan's ministry in the Breadalbane country. Later references There is a historical reference to Dewar in the 'Ragman Rolls', which is described as '..the Submission and Fealty sworne by the Generality of all the Scots Nation to King Edward I between the years 1292 to 1298‚Äô. It records a Thomas de Dewere and Piers de Dewere, both of the place Dewar in the parish of Heriot, Midlothian in the county of Edinburgh, 'did render true and rightful homage to King Edward I of England' at Berwick-on-Tweed on the 28th day of August in the year 1296. In the ‚ÄòScottorum Historiae‚Äô (1527) Hector Boece suggests that Thomas de Dewere and Piers de Dewere were descendants of a Malcolm Robert Dewere, formerly of Ewich near Strathfillan and Glen Dochart, who received land in Heriot as a reward for slaying a marauding wolf 'muckle feart' in the district. Malcolm named this land as Dewere, now Dewar, and was known thereafter as Malcolm de Dewere or 'Dewer the Wolf'. The story of the slaying of this wolf forms an interesting connection to Saint Fillan, where legends attribute a more extravagant miracle to this recalcitrant monk. It appears a wolf, feared in the district, killed Fillan‚Äôs oxen but through the Saint‚Äôs prayers the wolf submitted to Fillan and took the oxen‚Äôs place as his beast of burden. Over two centuries later, on 24 February 1474, a ‚ÄòCharter‚Äô granted by William, Lord Borthwick, confirmed a William Dewar in ownership and possession of Dewar lands. This ownership of Dewar remained with the family along with that of Harper-rig until the year 1618 when, under some pressure to raise promised funds for the church, William Dewar de Eodem sold all these lands to Lady Maxwell of Newbattle. Descendants and relatives The descendants of Thomas and Piers Dewar continued over several hundred years until in 1693 the estate was acquired by the Cranstoun family. In 1890 a Joseph Young Trotter-Cranstoun reaffirmed the ‚Äòarms‚Äô that can still be seen over the door of the Dewar farm. Their pedigree is listed in Burke‚Äôs Landed Gentry (1914). There are a number of other early references to Dewars and Dewar families associated with the relics of St Fillan. During the reign of William I, in a confirmation to the St Andrews Cathedral Priory, included ‚Äò-the church of Tealing (Angus) with the ‚Äòpriest‚Äôs toft‚Äô and the ‚Äòletters and toft of the deoradh‚Äô, indicating the importance of the keeper‚Äôs position in formal church ceremonial.Dewar Family Document Collection: Regesta Regum Scottorum #358. Saint Fillan and the Holy Relics Background Considering various Dewar families, historical links with Saint Fillan, it's probably worth mentioning here a bit more about this erstwhile pilgrim. Fillan, also known as Foelan or Fulan was the eldest son of Feriach, grandson of King Ceallach of Leinster. He became a monk in the Abbey of Saint Fintan Munnu before he was twenty and arrived in Scotland from Ireland circa 734AD, along with his mother St. Kentigerna and Uncle or kinsman Comgan. Originally Fillan settled near the St Andrew‚Äôs Monastery in Fife where, in due course he was elected Abbot. He resigned this post and after a few years as a missionary monk in Wexford, he returned to Scotland to resume a hermetical life near Glen Dochart, in Perthshire. Here he built a church and became renowned for his miracles, especially his healing of the sick and the ‚Äòdafties‚Äô. Pilgrims brought their sick ‚Äòo‚Äô mind charges from all over Scotland to be cured at Strathfillan. Usually the poor souls deemed mentally ill were dipped into a pool and then left tied up in Fillan‚Äôs chapel overnight. If they had freed themselves by morning they were proclaimed cured. This practice continued long after Fillan, well into the 19th century. Saint Fillan's times Various and differing accounts attribute extravagant miracles and deeds to him including that of the conversion of the wolf. Nonetheless, St Fillan lived through some of the most important years of the Medieval Church. In 700 AD about the time of his birth, the Psalms were translated into Anglo Saxon. The Lindisfarne Gospels were produced and Benedictine missionaries completed the conversion of England begun by Gregory the Great. One year after Fillan stepped ashore in Scotland the Venerable Bede wrote his History of the English Church and People in Latin and Irish monks established early medieval art as used for the Book of Kells. St Fillan‚Äôs feast day is still celebrated on 9 or 19 January, depending where you are but the 19th is the recorded date of his death. Relics and miracles The Crozier A number of relics are associated with St Fillan. It is almost certain they were held by separate Dewar families but in all likelihood these families were probably related through marriage. The origin of the most well known relic, the Crozier, is still uncertain but it is recorded as a simple shepherd‚Äôs staff with the head, handle or crook, covered in bronze sometime in the 11th Century. This in turn was covered by an elaborate silver crozier-head in the early 14th century following some malicious damage to the original. The owner or bearer of the Crozier became known as the ‚ÄòCoigerach‚Äô, which in literal translation also means ‚Äòpilgrim‚Äô or ‚Äòwanderer‚Äô, possibly a name association or as a result of the many places to which this hereditary keeper carried the Crozier. The Coigerach acted as healer, messenger and guardian to the people of Glen Dochart and, with the aid of the Crozier, he was reputed to have pursued and retrieved lost or stolen goods including sheep and cattle ‚Äî an enterprise rewarded by a payment of fourpence, or gift of shoes in addition to entitlement of beef, meal or mead from each family of Glen Dochart. The Crozier was venerated and reputed to have various healing and sanctified properties. The Bell Another famous relic, the Bell was a common instrument carried by traveling monks and other holy men. Malcolm Dewar na Bernane had custody of this particular relic which is reputed to have ninth- century French origins. The Bell was known locally as the ‚Äòbearnane‚Äô or ‚Äòthe bear‚Äôs ane‚Äô or sometimes ‚Äòlittle gapped one‚Äô. It is about twelve inches in height and is a one piece cast of bronze alloy. Curiously it has no clapper again bearing likeness to those carried by early French monks. The Bell seemed to have some significance though; certainly enough to ensure it was carried in procession at the coronation of King James IV at Scone in 1488. Saint Fillan‚Äôs Bell disappeared for almost two hundred years most likely hidden away to prevent its destruction by reformists, and for a period it was also believed to have been cursed. For some time following the Reformation it sat on a tombstone in the old churchyard of Strathfillan and, like the Crozier and Stane was used in rites to cure the sick and insane. It was stolen c.1799 and again it disappeared, this time for a mere seventy years until recovered in Herefordshire by the Bishop of Brechin who returned it to Scotland. Both the Bell and Crozier are now displayed in Edinburgh. The Stone Of St Fillan‚Äôs Stone (stane) the ‚ÄòFerg‚Äô, much less is known. In fact there is very little reference to the stone as a ‚Äòrelic‚Äô except as a footnote to a copy- translation of a Papal letter dated 1252. This stane‚Äôs importance was largely ignored by historians until the discovery of this Papal letter in 1896. The ‚Äòfootnote‚Äô appears on the first copy-translation, completed c.1519 at the Abbey of Saint-Amand de Bouvines. This copy document was later transferred to the Monastery de la Daurade in Toulouse c.1524 and a translation remains in a collection of papers belonging to the De Guise family, now lodged with the Biblioth√®que Nationale. This Papal letter is further referred to in correspondence between Mary Queen of Scots and Catherine de M√©dicis.Lettres de Catherine de M√©dicis, 10 vol Two further ‚Äôauthorised translations‚Äô were published in London in 1874 and a new illustrated copy of the original translation was authorized by the Vatican in 1999 and completed by Sister Maximillian at the Hermitage of Our Lady & St Nicodemus in Scotland. Further reference to the ‚ÄòStane‚Äô is found in Queen Mary‚Äôs letter or charter of 1563 to Malise Dewere. Malcolm and the Stone It is quite likely that this ‚ÄòLetter of Office‚Äô granted to Malcolm Robert (Dewere) Jore in 1252 by Pope Innocent IV clearly recognized Malcolm as a ‚Äòdeoradh‚Äô or ‚Äòrelic keeper‚Äô stating: ‚ÄòYou also, Malcolm Robert Jore, Deoradh, and your successors, who can now display Our confidence and authority with skillful energy, in labouring for the salvation of souls in the preservation of Our faith by the safekeeping of Our Holy Relic of Saint Fillan‚Äô.Dewar Family Document Collection: Veters Monumenta Hibernium et Scottorum Historiam Illus. No. cclxiv.Papal Letter: Translation of 1874 and original document dated 1252 Malcolm is thought to have made pilgrimage to France in that year to collect this letter and taking with him Fillan‚Äôs ‚Äòstane‚Äô for protection. Three years later however in 1255, in a letter to Henry III of England from Alexander III of Scotland, this same Malcolm Jore is listed as a 'bishop-elect' of Glen Dochart being amongst those 'removed' from the King's council 'because their faults so demand‚Äô.P.R.O. Charter Roll 39 Henry III, C53/46A In 1276 Master Baiamundus de Vitia, Canon of Asti and appointed Papal Collector exempted all churches venerating any relics of Saint Fillan, from any taxes due to Rome. Vatican archives record no less than seven relics associated with Saint Fillan and two other Dewar families had relics attributed to this Saint in their safekeeping. The Dewar na Man certainly had custody of the Saint‚Äôs forearm bone and the Dewar De Messer kept the Saint‚Äôs missal. Last records of the Stone The Stone as a Holy Relic is recorded by the Papal Archivist, Giuseppe Garampi in the late eighteenth century.Bollanda Ada SS (1643) In the Scottish Historical Manuscripts, Archie Moncrief recalls ‚Äòthe stane, as displayed and venerated at Murthly Kirk‚Äô before being formally returned to the Dewar na Ferg, the ‚Äòdeoradh‚Äô from whose family it is understood ours is descendant.SHM \\"Burgh of Perth 1844\\" (iv). The Dewars in History Robert the Bruce It is recorded in several sources that Dewar families fought with the Scottish armies at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June 1314. It is known that before the battle, Robert the Bruce and his army received Holy Communion and that Saint Fillan‚Äôs Crozier, in the custody of Malcolm Deor or Jore, along with the forearm bone of that Saint ‚Äòwas elevated by Abbot Maurice of Inchaffray before some 10,000 men‚Äô. It is most likely the Bell and Stone in the custody of their individual keepers were also present on this occasion. Following his victory over the English at Bannockburn and as a mark of thanksgiving, King Robert I, (as the Bruce had become), established a church at Tyndrum in Strathfillan which he dedicated to Saint Fillan. King Robert also recognised the right of Malcolm Deor (?) or Jore and his heirs and successors, as ‚ÄòCoarb of Saint Fillan‚Äô, to ‚Äòbear wi honeste undertakn hs haly lettres of office‚Äô It is however understood this latter title was bestowed singly on the custodian of the Crozier and does not include other custodians. There exists a letter of confirmation of lands in Ewich of Glen Dochart in favour of Donald M‚ÄôSobrell, also known as MacSobrell Deoir and Dewar Coigerach, dated 1336. Later developments On 22 April 1428, at an Inquest in Kindrochit Castle held by the Baillie of Glen Dochart, Baillie John de Spense of Perth ‚Äòupheld the authority and privileges of Findlay Jore, also named as Deoir‚Äô recognizing Findlay as the rightful Dewar Coigerach as gifted by the Coarb of Saint Fillan, known then in the Celtic tradition, as Hereditary Abbot of Glen Dochart.Dewar Family Document Collection: National Museum of Scotland 5.99 / National Register of Archives ref. 1522. Finally, in a further hearing at the Court of the Baillie of Glen Dochart on 9 February 1468, a John Molcalloum M'Gregor, defending a claim for rents by a Lady Margaret Stirling of Glenorchy, asserted the lands he held at Corehynan in Auchertyre, were gifted by the Deoir de Meser and the Deoir Coigerach. Final disposition On 6 July 1487 a letter of gift, decree and deed of confirmation from King James III, was given under the Privy Seal in Edinburgh to Findlay Jore‚Äôs son, Malise Deoir or Dewar, who was to be secured in the peaceful possession of the Holy Relic of Saint Fillan called the ‚ÄòQuigrich‚Äô. This document further declares that the King understands that ‚ÄòMalice Deoir, or Dewar and his forebears has had an relic of Sanct Fulane callit the Quergich in keping.. ..sen the tyme of King Robert the Bruys', and before then, and that they were in no way responsible to any persons, either spiritual or temporal, with regard the relic. The King also commands his subjects to grant all possible facilities to Malise in the discharge of his duties and in no way to hinder, or impede him passing with the relic, through the country ‚Äòas he and his forebearis were wont to do‚Äô. The King‚Äôs subjects were further charged to see that Malise ‚Äòwas kept unthrallit and free in the use of the relic under all the hiest paine‚Äô.Dewar Family Document Collection: National Archives of Scotland ref. GD112/1/23. The Dewar Family since the 16th century The saga of the Stone continues In August 1527 Archibald Deoir the great grandson of Malise Deoir or 'Dewar the Younger' and son of Archibald Deoir, 'Dewar na Ferg' married Maria Jane Parcevaux of Rochelle in France. Maria Jane was a direct descendant of Maurice Parcevaux, (1325‚Äì1376) Champion of Combat and Governor of the Rochelle district in France. The Parcevaux family coats of arms bear a striking similarity to that later adopted by the Irish family O'Dwyer but there is no available record showing a line of descent or any connection. The marriage of Maria and Archibald is recorded in the ‚ÄòNobiliare et Armorial De Bretagne‚Äô reprinted in 1970.Dewar Family Document Collection: Armoriales Portess et Crete de la famille Parcevaux-Deoir,(Une Histoire d'Art Heraldique en France 1200~1700 ref L.57) In 1547 a claim was made by Hugh Currie, then Prior of Strathfillan, to the relics and remains of Malise Deoir, also known as Deoir-na-Quigrich and, in separate claims, for those relics held by Malcolm Deoir, Dewar-na-Bernane, keeper of St. Fillan's Bell and Archibald Deoir, Dewar-na-Ferg, custodian of St. Fillan's Stone (a descendant of Malcolm Dewar, 'Dewere the Wolf'). This claim was vigorously defended and finally dismissed by the Lords of the Privy Council. Two years later however, on 4 March 1551, the Register of the Great Seal records that Mary, Queen of Scots levied charges of 40 shillings annually, singly upon Malise Deoir, or Dewere, his heirs and successors, for all his lands and properties at Croitendeor and Ewich in Aucharne and Cragwoken in Glen Dochart, which were hitherto exempt.Dewar Family Document Collection: Register of the Great Seal, Vol. IV #682. Then, some twelve years after the aforementioned charges were levied against Malise Deoir, Queen Mary had an apparent ‚Äòchange of heart‚Äô towards some Dewar families and, no doubt influenced by the growing pressures of the Reformation, granted a Letter or Charter of Protection to Malise, Dewere na Ferg. The letter is dated 27 August 1563 and in it she refers directly to Malise‚Äôs rightful title and role as ‚Äòkeeper‚Äô of a relic of Saint Fillan, ‚Äòtakis vnder oure speciale protectioun supple manteinance defence and saufgard, our loyal servitour Malise Dewere and hs successours of our burgh of Perth, in keping wi an relick of Saint Filane callit the Stane‚Äô.Dewar Family Document Collection: Scottish Historical Manuscripts iv. Burgh of Perth 1844, pp. 72. In Charter dated 2 December 1575 and confirmed in 1583 by King James VI, Donald Macindeorca, also known as Macindeor vic Coigerach, sold the Dewar lands to Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy. 17th to the early 19th centuries The Dewar‚Äôs (na Ferg) seemed to have survived the next two hundred years avoiding the gibbet and the axe but there are few references to our family of any note until 1792 when Robert, son of Robert Dewar and Margaret Kincaid of Killen married a Mary Peat (also spelled as Peatt) on 7 December 1792 at Kilmany. Mary was the daughter of Maria Peat ne Rosz or Rousza. The Rousza family (?) arrived at Greenock from Hungary in February 1765. From surviving Parish records Maria is known to have married James Peat, a prominent trader and ship owner from Glasgow. Subsequently, Mary Rose Peat was born in 1773 at Doune near Dunblane. The Peat family was well respected by society and Mary was well educated. At the young age of sixteen she appears to have gained employment in the Edinburgh home of the Douglases of Cavers as a ladies companion from 1788 until 1791. During this employment, Mary became acquainted with and befriended a number of important persons through the Douglases. One of these was the Borders poet John Leyden (1775‚Äì1811). Leyden‚Äôs father also worked for the Douglas family and John was probably attending the University of Edinburgh at that time. Even after her marriage to Robert Dewar, Mary‚Äôs friendship and obvious financial support to Leyden continued until 1803 when Leyden took up a position as Assistant Surgeon to the Madras Establishment in India. Among the family's papers is a letter from Leyden written on 5 April 1803 at Portsmouth (...two days from London) whilst waiting to sail to Madras. In this he mentions dining with Mary‚Äôs younger brother James and with Walter Scott (...who is just arrived) and his association with other notables. He promises to write again following his arrival in India but no record of any further correspondence exists. John Leyden never returned to his native land as he died on Java on 28 August 1811. 19th century to the present Three generations on, William Martin Dewar married Margaret Bayne on 25 November 1881 at Kinnoull in the County of Perth acknowledging Margaret's illegitimate son Robert Bayne who was born on 30 August 1876. Robert Bayne Dewar later worked as a ploughman/farmer at Inchture and married Edith McEwan Jack, a domestic servant at Inchture on 18 November 1898. Robert and Edith had ten children but the male heir was the youngest, John Cameron Dewar, born 11 May 1918 at Millbridge, Kinross-shire. John married Catherine Baxter Ramsay on 6 February 1937. John served with the Royal Air Force between 1938 and 1946. He then worked as a market gardener with John Ogilvie Millar. Some years later he became Factor/Gardener to Lord Ogilvie at Teases Estates in Fife. Catherine and John had three children of whom two, John and Patricia survive. John Cameron Dewar died in Edinburgh on 5 January 1983 and Catherine Baxter Dewar on 13 November 2006. John Dewar's folk tales In 1859 a John Dewar working as a woodsman for George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll at Glendaruel, sent a letter to his employer enclosing a copy of the Gaelic text of his ‚ÄòTales of the Gael on the Wintry Nights‚Äô as an example of his work. There is no record of why he did this in the Campbell papers of that time; but soon after, John was enabled to devote his whole time to gathering folk tales throughout the Highlands. Working under the direction of J.F. Campbell of Islay, he spent many years traveling around the West Highlands recording these tales in the Gaelic language. By the time Dewar had finished his work they had become the largest and most important collection of popular and local tradition ever written down by one man. These collected works became known to scholars as the ‚ÄòDewar Manuscripts‚Äô. John Dewar died in 1872 at the age of 70 years.

Life His parents were German-Jewish and Turkish immigrants. After serving in World War I, he attended Cornell University for three years, but dropped out. The Quill In 1917, he returned to Greenwich Village, founding The Quill with partner Harold Hersey and was managing editor and wrote articles. It included artists Clara Tice, Wood Gaylor, Mark Tobey and Alfred J Frueh; writers included Ben De Casseres. He married Millia Davenport (1895‚Äì1992) and worked with her at The Quill. They co-authored, The Quill: For And By Greenwich Village, vol.4, no.8, 1919. They separated shortly thereafter. She went on to design costumes, and in 1948 wrote The Book of Costume. In 1920, he hired his future wife Florence Gilliam to edit Quill. In 1921 they moved to Paris, into a small apartment near Shakespeare & Company, the bookstore owned by Sylvia Beach. Gargoyle In August 1921, they began publishing Gargoyle, an intense literary magazine. Gargoyle published reproductions of Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Andr√© Derain, Amedeo Modigliani, Paul C√©zanne. Writers contributing to the publication included Ezra Pound, Robert Coates, Malcolm Cowley, Hart Crane, Stephen Vincent Benet, Hilda Doolittle and Sinclair Lewis. Without outside backing and lacking a subscriber base, in October 1922, Gargoyle ceased publication. For the next few years Arthur would write a column for The New York Times and the Paris Herald. Hemingway Ernest Hemingway and his wife moved to Paris in December 1921. He loved books and frequented Shakespeare & Co. where he met Moss, who convinced Hemingway to submit articles to Gargoyle. These early writings drew the attention of Robert McAlmon. The original writings are now in the JFK Library. Boulevardier In 1927 Arthur began publishing Boulevardier with Erskine Gwynne. Patterned after The New Yorker, one of the regular illustrators was Raymond Peynet. Contributors included Michael Arlen, No√´l Coward, Louis Bromfield, Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway. Moss and Gilliam divorced in 1931. By 1932 he married Evalyn Marvel. He was survived by his widow Doreen Vidal.

He authored a widely syndicated travel feature in the late 1970s, co-authored a book about the Dionne Quintuplets, and authored a book about the death of an Aboriginal woman. Nihmey is listed in Who's Who in Canada. He had two children. Early life Nihmey was born in Ottawa and grew up working in his family's diner. His father, Philip Nihmey, died when he was nine, requiring that he and his four brothers help his mother (Lily Monsour: 1914-2003) in the family business. Nihmey graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelor of Arts, Honours in English in 1976. His first writing assignments were covering outdoor festival events in Ottawa for the Ottawa Journal. Hotels of the World In 1976, Nihmey wrote a feature article about the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California for the Ottawa Citizen. The feature caught the attention of a Toronto Star Syndicate editor, who suggested that Nihmey independently syndicate the story and a monthly series on great hotels to newspapers across Canada. Within a year John Nihmey's Hotels of the World was syndicated in 15 Canadian newspapers and later in the Northeastern United States. Over the next three years, Nihmey visited more than 40 countries, writing about H√¥tel Ritz Paris, The Peninsula Hong Kong, The Pierre in New York, the Negresco in Nice, France and La Mamounia in Marrakech.

Time of Their Lives: The Dionne Tragedy Nihmey and co-author Stuart Foxman wrote Time of Their Lives: The Dionne Tragedy, a novel that looked at the Dionne Quintuplets story from the parents' perspective. The book chronicled the events leading to the alleged government exploitation of the children and the marginalization of the parents. The book was released in Canada in 1986 by Macmillan of Canada. The Toronto Star stated that readers \\"will read and weep\\" while the Globe and Mail said the book was \\"vindication for the Dionne parents\\". Literary Guild bought book club rights and Bantam bought paperback rights. The book was released in the US the following year, again to critical acclaim, with book club and paperback rights also acquired. Nihmey and Stuart appeared on in an exclusive interview by Bryant Gumbel on NBC's Today Show. Film rights were purchased in 1987, leading to the 1994 CBS/CBC miniseries, Million Dollar Babies.

Fireworks and Folly Nihmey wrote and published (Hushion House/General Publishing) the non-fiction narrative, Fireworks and Folly: How We Killed Minnie Sutherland, in 1998. The book is a mosaic of Nihmey's narrative with police records, inquest testimony, personal interviews, and media excerpts about the life and death of Minnie Sutherland, a woman of First Nations ancestry.. The book was launched at the Press Club in Ottawa and John was introduced by Assembly of First Nations Chief, Ovide Mercredi. The Globe and Mail said the book was \\"must reading for all Canadians\\". TVO Studio Two produced a documentary on the book] with an interview of Nihmey. The book was also published in French by Vent l'ouest. A film project was in early development. NIVA Inc.

History In 1920, Peter Torjesen, a Norwegian missionary, went to Hequ in Shanxi Province and established various social and community services as part of his ministry. In 1989 the Shanxi provincial government invited Torjesen's descendants, who had since emigrated to the United States, to return to Shanxi and resume this charitable work. In response, the Torjesen family and their friends established Shanxi Evergreen Services. (‚ÄòEvergreen‚Äô is a reference to the Chinese name that Torjesen used, ). The organisation has since grown steadily. Work has included long-term training programmes for local health professionals in family medicine and maternal and child health. A ‚ÄòSamaritan Fund‚Äô covers the costs of essential medical treatment for impoverished people in Yangqu County. SES provides scholarships for children from poor families to remain in school, and has established a community centre that includes a library and computer equipment. Various activities for local children take place at the centre, which also oversees a mobile library service that lends reading materials to rural schools. An Evergreen Agricultural Training and Demonstration Centre facilitates training in appropriate agricultural technologies, provides assistance in marketing produce, and helps farmers to form cooperatives and technical associations that improve productivity. New, low-cost biogas digester technology is now being tested, for incorporation into agricultural development projects. Other ongoing projects include English language training for people with limited access to foreign teachers ‚Äì such as health workers in urban hospitals, rural middle school teachers; assistance to Chinese and international businesses and organizations looking to bring foreign investment to Shanxi, and facilitation of foreign experts and cultural exchanges in military, publishing, academic, religious and economic sectors.

Heard, with his mother and three siblings Millie, Beverley and Cordelia,A last brother, George Clark Heard, was born later:From Slavery to the Bishopric in the A.M.E. Church, An Autobiography by William H. Heard was sold twice as a child. When he was nine and already working as a servant in the household where his mother was a cook, both she and his elder sister died of typhoid fever. At age ten Heard was set to work as a plow boy on a farm. At fifteen, having been assaulted by a drunken \\"boss man\\" and becoming aware of the potential ending of his slave status after the Civil War, he fled and began living with his father, who kept a wheelwright's shop in Elberton. Although literacy was forbidden to slaves prior to the Civil War, Heard attended Sunday School and trained his memory by learning large amounts of the Bible by rote. After emancipation, while living with his father, he paid a white schoolboy ten cents a lesson to teach him basic literacy. He also began working for a local farmer, on terms of five dollars a month and the opportunity, each night, of reciting back to him a lesson Heard had learned over lunch. This farmer was William H. Heard, from whom Heard then took his name (he had previously been known as \\"Henry\\"). Heard then attempted a similar arrangement with another local farmer, but, dissatisfied with the education he was receiving, he returned and began working at his father's shop. By this time a school had been set up in Elberton which he could attend. By following every opportunity for educational advancement which offered itself, Heard in time achieved a teaching qualification and a place at university. He attended the University of South Carolina until 1877, when all black students were removed by the state government. Career In the 1870s during the Reconstruction era Heard was elected to the state legislature in South Carolina, as a Republican representing Abbeville County, but was removed when the Democrats achieved power. Because of his political interests he was not allowed to find work as a teacher in the state. He later completed his education in Philadelphia. In 1878 Heard, whose parents had followed Baptist and Methodist faiths,Wright, Richard R., Centennial Encyclopaedia of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Book Concern of the A. M. E. Church, Philadelphia, 1916, p.111 joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church. He rose rapidly through its ranks, being ordained elder in 1883 and elected bishop in 1908. As well as being a preacher he was an active organizer and fundraiser, holding appointments to numerous missions, and from 1888 attending all A.M.E. general conferences as delegate. He also continued to press for equal treatment for all citizens, regardless of color. In 1887 Heard launched a legal challenge against the Georgia Railroad Company over its practice of providing separate and inferior accommodation for blacks while charging them full prices.New York Times, July 30, 1887:\\"No \\"Jim Crow cars\\". The Georgia railroad demands relief of the Commission.\\" With the help of Henry McNeal Turner he obtained his diplomatic appointment, being nominated Minister Resident and Consul General to Liberia by President Grover Cleveland on February 21, 1895.New York Times, February 22, 1895 While in Monrovia, Heard also served as superintendent of the Liberia Annual Conference of the A.M.E. Church and built the first A.M.E. church in the city, the Eliza Turner Memorial Chapel. Before returning to America he also toured Europe, observing during a visit to the British Museum that the mummies of Ancient Egypt were clearly of an African, not a Caucasian, race. He also noted that racial prejudice was less strong in France than in any English-speaking country, and seemed non-existent in Switzerland. Heard continued to be active in the affairs of his church for the rest of his life, attending the second World Conference on Faith and Order in Edinburgh, Scotland, only the month before his death. On reports circulating in the press that he had been refused accommodation by one Edinburgh hotel on grounds of color, he was invited to meet the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, and his wife, at another. The Archbishop of York also offered him hospitality.\\"Invitation To Faith Conference.\\" The Times [London, England] August 9, 1937: p. 12. The Times Digital Archive. Web. Aug. 19, 2012.

History The abbey was founded in 1133 as a daughter house of Morimond Abbey and settled initially in the old castle of the Counts of Berg, Burg Berge, which the counts had left for Schloss Burg, but moved to the new purpose-built monastery in the valley of the Dh√ºnn in 1153.Norbert Orthen: Unter dem Zeichen der Jakobsmuschel.

In 1803 it was dissolved during the secularisation of Germany and fell into ruin. Starting in 1847 under King Frederick William IV of Prussia, a thorough restoration was carried out, and the restored church, known as the Altenberger Dom (\\"Altenberg Cathedral\\", although Altenberg was never the seat of a bishopric so this is not technically accurate), is now an interdenominational church used by both Roman Catholics and Protestants.

In 1869 the Rev. William Thom, a Presbyterian minister, was appointed to the Twofold Bay charge, residing at Pambula. His wife (Clarinda Menie) was the eldest daughter of Sir Henry Parkes and both were ardent supporters of public education. Pambula already had a well established school but the Rev. and Mrs. Thom felt there was an urgent need for more schools in the district. It is known that Mrs Thom made a private approach to her father on the matter and received a sympathetic response. Formal application for a school at Merimbula was made to the Council of Education in October, 1869, signed by the Rev. W. Thom, Adam K. Page and Armstrong L. Munn. Parents undertook to pay one third of the cost of a building. School began in temporary premises in 1870. The stone building still standing in Main Street, on land donated by Sir William Montagu Manning, was first used on 8 October 1875 and is believed to be one of only three schools comprising both classrooms and a teacher's residence remaining in New South Wales. In 1875, the enrollment was 39 children. School fees were set by the local board within limits specified in the legislation. Initially parents paid a weekly fee of 9 pence for the first child and 6 pence for each additional child, but in 1893 this was reduced to 3 pence per head per week, with a maximum of 9 pence per family. According to the Public Instruction Act of 1880, fees should have changed in 1880 to the new limits of 3 pence per child with a maximum of a shilling per family. The building was vacated at the end of 1945, and the school reopened in new premises, which have been enlarged over the years. The residence was repaired and leased for accommodation, and the schoolroom was used for community purposes for a number of years. The building was eventually abandoned. In 1969 the Merimbula-Imlay Historical Society was formed and requested permission to use the building as a museum, which after extensive repairs was opened in 1973. The building is classified by the National Trust and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

The Iberian Peninsula in the 3rd century BC.  Origins  Of mixed Illyrian and Gallic origin, the latter possibly related to the Helvetic Rauraci, the Uraci migrated to the Iberian Peninsula around the 4th Century BC during the Celtic migration,Pliny the Elder, Natural History, III, 29.Strabo, Geographikon, III, 4, 12. and their tribal name can be roughly translated as \\"those [placed] farther apart\\".Motoza, Los Celt√≠beros, etnias y estados (1998, revised edition 2007), p. 42.

Their capital was the town of Lutiaca (Luzaga? ‚Äì Guadalajara; Celtiberian mint: Lutiacos/Louitiscos); they also controlled the strategic towns of Cortona (Medinacelli ‚Äì Soria), Segontia (Sig√ºenza ‚Äì Guadalajara) and Arcobriga (Monreal de Ariza ‚Äì Zaragoza).Motoza, Los Celt√≠beros, etnias y estados (1998, revised edition 2007), pp. 199-201.  Culture  It is assumed that the Uraci spoke a 'Q-Celtic' language and archeological evidence shows that their material culture little differed from the Celtiberians.  History  Forced to become clients of the powerful Arevaci around the late 4th or early 3rd Centuries BC, the Uraci were certainly obliged to provide military assistance to their patrons' throughout most of the 2nd Century BC, but what role they played in the 2nd Punic War and subsequent conflicts with Rome remains unclear.Motoza, Los Celt√≠beros, etnias y estados (1998, revised edition 2007), pp. 194-195. In about 92 BC the Uraci began to overthrow Arevacian overlordship ‚Äì quite plausibly at Roman instigation ‚Äì being rewarded with the town of Numantia from the defeated Pellendones for helping the Romans in suppressing the early 1st Century BC anti-Roman uprisings in Celtiberia (the 3rd Celtiberian War).Motoza, Los Celt√≠beros, etnias y estados (1998, revised edition 2007), pp. 194-195.

It is a Latin term, coined by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his Novum Organum, one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the methodical approach of modern science. Overview The term is one of four such \\"idols\\" which represent \\"idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults.Novum Organum, Aphorism XXXVIII Besides idola tribus, there are also idola specus, (Idols of the Cave, caused by one's personal peculiarities and experiences) idola fori (Idols of the Market Place, caused by language) and idola theatri (Idols of the Theatre, caused by philosophers). And so in this category are cases of people being misled by anthropomorphism. In more detail, Bacon enumerated several specific such barriers to science which are part of human nature, coming into this category: *\\"The human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism XLV *\\"The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism XLVI *\\"The human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly, and so fill the imagination; and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow, though it cannot see how, similar to those few things by which it is surrounded.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism XLVII *\\"The human understanding is unquiet; it cannot stop or rest, and still presses onward, but in vain. Therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world, but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism XLVIII Bacon gives as example the Aristotelian doctrine of final cause, which he says has \\"relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe; and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy\\". *\\"The human understanding is no dry light, but receives an infusion from the will and affections; whence proceed sciences which may be called \\"sciences as one would.\\" For what a man had rather were true he more readily believes.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism XLIX *\\"But by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness, incompetency, and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it, though they be more important.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism L *\\"The human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting.\\"Novum Organum, Aphorism LI Bacon said that the Idols of the Tribe \\"take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit, or from its preoccupation, or from its narrowness, or from its restless motion, or from an infusion of the affections, or from the incompetency of the senses, or from the mode of impression\\".Novum Organum, Aphorism LII See also *Idols of the mind *Doxa References External links *Novum Organum (in Latin) *New Organon (1863 English translation) Category:Prejudices Category:Inductive fallacies Category:Types of scientific fallacy Category:Francis Bacon ","title":"Idola tribus"},{"id":"24749568","text":"Luzhou District (), formerly known as Chengqu () or Cheng District is a district of Changzhi, Shanxi, China.

Jerwa is best known for his work on comic tie-ins for several prominent licensed properties, including Battlestar Galactica, Highlander, G.I. Joe and Army of Darkness. Jerwa also collaborates frequently with fellow writer Eric S. Trautmann. Jerwa is the lead singer and founder of Seattle-area band SD6, and was previously the lead singer and co-founder of the bands Omnibox and Relay. Before he began his career in comics, Jerwa was a morning DJ at KRQT \\"Rocket 107\\" FM in Longview, Washington. Biography Jerwa's comic book career began in 2003, when he submitted a script to Devil's Due Publishing that was accepted, and was eventually published in G.I. Joe: Frontline #11‚Äì14. Soon afterwards, he became the main writer on G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and also wrote several G.I. Joe miniseries. On May 18, 2006, Brandon was featured on episode #24 of the Game Show Network's I've Got a Secret; his secret being that in honor of his work on the G.I. Joe comics, Hasbro used his face as the basis for the G.I. Joe action figure Dragonsky. In 2006 and 2007, Jerwa began writing for Dynamite Entertainment, working on the series Highlander, cowriting the first four issues with Michael Avon Oeming before moving on to a prolific run on Battlestar Galactica. On Free Comic Book Day 2007, Jerwa met several people affiliated with DC Comics, including Eric S. Trautmann and Greg Rucka. Jerwa and Trautmann struck up a partnership and collaborated on a project called Wide Awake, which appeared first as a short story in Popgun Vol. 2, then as a Free Comic Book Day special, and then later as a free webcomic. In 2009, the duo pitched an idea for a graphic novel to DC's imprint Vertigo, which was accepted, and soon after Jerwa was contacted about working with DC directly. Jerwa's first work for DC Comics was in September 2009 as the writer of the Inferno co-feature in The Shield, a monthly series that introduced re-imagined versions of the Red Circle Comics superhero characters into the DC Universe. In late 2009, Jerwa also wrote for a Dynamite series based on Stargate SG-1. In 2011 Jerwa raised $19,000 through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter for a comic book-themed documentary title UNTOLD TALES OF THE COMIC INDUSTRY As of June 2017, this Kickstarter is still not fulfilled.

The Cratistii (Greek Kratistioi) were an ancient pre-Roman, stock-raising people whose lands were situated along the upper Tagus valley, in the elevated plateau region of the western Cuenca and northeast Province of Teruel.  Origins  An intriguing people, their ethnic origins are difficult to determine though their tribal name means \\"the most powerful\\". They bear no close relation to the Caristii who lived further north in the modern Vizcaya and √Ålava Basque provinces.  Culture  Archeological evidence retrieved from the cemetery of Madrigueras (Albacete) suggests that their culture was strongly Celtiberianized, being more closely affiliated with that of the neighbouring Olcades. Their presumed capital was Segobriga (Cerro de Cabeza de Griego, Saelices ‚Äì Cuenca; Celtiberian-type mint: Sekobirikes)Pliny the Elder, Natural History, III, 26. and they held the important towns of Ercavica (Ca√±averuelas ‚Äì Cuenca; Celtiberian-type mint: Ercauica), and Contrebia Carbica (Fosos de Bayona, Villas Viejas ‚Äì Cuenca; Celtiberian-type mints: Contebacom/Carbicom/Konterbia Karbica).Jes√∫s Corrobles Santos, Los Carpetanos, in Prehistoria y Protohistoria de la Meseta Sur‚Ä¶ (2007), pp. 194-195.  History  Initially a dependent tribe of the Carpetani since at least the early 3rd Century BC, the Cratistii were submitted to Carthaginian rule upon the conquest of eastern Carpetania by Hannibal Barca in 221-220 BC.Polybius, Istorion, III, 3.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 21: 5. Later they appear to have gravitated gradually towards the Roman sphere in the aftermath of the 2nd Punic War only to be raided by the Lusitani, who sacked Segobriga in 146 BC.Paulus Orosius, Historiarum adversus Paganus, 5, 4, 5. Following the end of the Sertorian Wars in the mid-1st Century BC, the Cratistii regained their independence from the enfeebled Carpetani and were incorporated alongside their Uraci neighbours into romanized southern Celtiberia.

It is one of the earliest musical types used by the Greeks. The prosodion was accompanied by the aulos, whereas the associated paean (performed while standing) was accompanied by the kithara. Prosodia were composed by Alcman, Pindar, Simonides of Ceos, Bacchylides, Eumelus of Corinth, and Limenius (whose prosodion follows its paean, rather than preceding it), as well the various winners in art competitions (Mouseia).literally, \\"activity having to do with the Muses The etymology of the word is related to hodos road and not with √¥id√™ song. According to Soterichus, the music of the prosodia by Alcman, Pindar, Simonides, and Bacchylides was written in the Dorian tonos \\"because of its grandeur and dignity\\". The only complete surviving prosodion (part of the Second Delphic Hymn by Limenius), however, is composed in the Lydian tonos.
