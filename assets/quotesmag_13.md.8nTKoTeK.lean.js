Wind rights are rights relating to windmills, wind turbines and wind power. Historically in Continental Europe wind rights were manorial rights and obligations relating to the operation and profitability of windmills. In modern times, as wind becomes a more important source of power, rights relating to wind turbines and windmills are sometimes referred to as \\"wind rights\\".  Low Countries  Historically, \\"wind rights\\" (Dutch: windrecht) referred to a tax paid by millers in large parts of the Low Countries before around 1800. The tax was paid on the \\"wind catch\\" (windvang) needed to turn a windmill, but it was often based on the windmill's output. In the northern provinces, however, ancient wind rights were lacking. Government regulations only dated from the 17th century. Prof. S. J. Fockema Andreae at Leiden University wrote an interesting article on this subject, entitled \\"Recht van den wind en molendwang\\", Tijdschrift voor rechtsgeschiedenis, Part 1, Issue 4, 1919, pp. 431-442, Haarlem. Since a windmill in a heerlijkheid was primarily the property of the lord (although leased out to a miller), wind rights were one way for a lord to discourage competition. In consideration for payment of this tax, the lord ensured that there were no wind obstructions around the mill by imposing a prohibition on buildings and high trees in the area. Another obligation imposed on residents was the \\"mill obligation\\" (molendwang), which required them to have their grain ground at the lord's mill. To a certain extent, this was another way for a lord to safeguard the income received from the mill. Because of these rights and obligations, windmills had to be identifiable. They each had a name, traditionally the name of an animal. An image of the animal was placed on the mill so that even the illiterate would know which mill was which. In the Netherlands, wind rights and the mill obligations were ended around 1800 when a new constitution was introduced in the Batavian Republic. Similar concepts still exist in modern times. Since around 1973 the wind needed to turn a mill has been referred to as the \\"windmill biotope\\" (molenbiotoop). An area of around a windmill is maintained as a \\"free zone\\" so that the windmill can have enough wind. For polder windmills, ensuring that windmills have enough wind is the responsibility of the water board (waterschap or hoogheemraadschap). However, this seldom takes priority over the desire of municipalities to build new housing.  United States  In Minnesota, as a result of the increased interest in wind energy, developers or utilities purchase “wind rights\\" from landowners to allow the installation of one or more wind generators and an access road to the equipment in exchange for a payment to the landowner. \\"Wind Rights to Private Land.\\" Minnesota Department of Commerce.

Historical Timeline Evidence and records suggest that by as early as the 1570s, members of the Missanabie Cree had settled in the areas surrounding present day Missinaibi Lake, Dog Lake and Wabatongushi Lake. According to Elders’ testimony and anthropological evidence, the Missanabie Cree had utilized these lands from time immemorial to hunt, fish and trap for food, for ceremonial purposes and to provide for the cultural, spiritual and economic well being of their people. In the 1660s Father Allouez confirmed that the Cree people regularly traveled between Lake Superior and James Bay.Reported by C. Bishop, The First Century: Adaptive Changes Among the Western James Bay Cree In the 1730s Cree speaking people with summer encampments at Bawating (Sault Ste. Marie) gathered to fish, trade and do ceremonies.Historians A. Greenberg and J. Morrison In 1904 the Indian Affairs Department recognized Missanabie Cree as an Indian band to be ‘treated with’ by Treaty Commissioners for the purpose of adhesions to Treaty 9 scheduled for 1905. In 1905 Canada and Ontario enter into Treaty 9 with various Cree and Ojibwa groups to obtain surrender of of land. In 1906 the Crown did not sign formal adhesions to Treaty 9 with the Missanabie Cree First Nation. The Crown did not set apart any reserve for 98 members of the First Nation living at Missanabie. In 1915 Missanabie Cree's request for land was turned down by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND). In 1925 the Chapleau Crown Preserve was created which abrogated Missanabie Cree's treaty rights to hunt and fish for subsistence living. In 1929 Missanabie Cree's request for land was turned down by DIAND. In 1951 Missanabie Cree were formally recognized by DIAND as an Indian band. In 1992, under the Indian Act, the first Chief and Council are elected by the Missanabie Cree First Nation. In 1993 Missanabie Cree First Nation submitted specific claim for outstanding Treaty Land Entitlement (TLE). In 1996 Missanabie Cree First Nation received a letter from Canada accepting the claim, with the condition that Ontario, also a signatory to Treaty 9, be at the table. Ontario began a legal review of the claim. In 1998 Missanabie Cree and Canada begin preliminary meetings in April. In 1999 jointly funded studies began. These included genealogical, traditional use, site selections, and loss of use. Legal review by Ontario was completed in June. A letter from Canada stated that negotiations could begin, if Ontario came to the table. In 2000 the Ontario Native Affairs Secretariat sent a letter indicating Ontario would be presenting its position. In 2001 preliminary discussions of the negotiation process began between First Nation and both levels of government. The development of a work plan and negotiation framework continued. In 2006 Ontario agreed to a land transfer of with conditions attached. The transferred land was to be credited towards the eventual settlement of the land claim (to be determined through legal action). Land area was selected. Discussions with Canada continued over additions to Reserve process and loss of use compensation. In 2008 Missanabie turned down an offer of $15 million from Canada. In 2011, on August 17, The Missanabie Cree First Nation and the Government of Ontario signed an agreement to provide the Nation with of land as an initial allotment of a total to which they are entitled under Treaty 9.http://media.knet.ca/node/11447 Notes First Nations in Ontario Swampy Cree Nishnawbe Aski Nation ","title":"Missanabie Cree First Nation"},{"id":"16083903","text":"Ispup (English: Spoof) was a sketch comedy show produced by ABC which features parodies of several Philippine television shows, films and advertisements with actors impersonating notable personalities such as Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Cardinal Jaime Sin, among others.

The program ended its almost 5-year run on February 15, 2004, and was replaced by the PBA coverage on ABC. The program was known for its extensive use of political satire and parodies poking fun at various aspects of Filipino and occasionally foreign pop culture, solely focusing on the popularity and sometimes notoriety of celebrities, television shows, and political figures.

It is a small, woody, open- branched shrub with crowded, linear leaves and small yellow flowers from May to September. Description Verticordia helichrysantha is an openly branched, more or less sprawling shrub which grows to high and wide. The leaves are clustered, crowded, pale greyish-green, long, linear to club- shaped, semi-circular in cross-section with a rounded end. The flowers are arranged singly or in small groups in the upper leaf axils, each flower on a stalk, long. The floral cup is long, smooth and hairy. The sepals are pale yellow, long, covered with short, soft hairs and have 4 or 5 feathery lobes. The petals are the same colour as the sepals, about long, erect and egg- shaped, covered with short, soft hairs on their outer surface and have irregular teeth along their edge. The style is long, curved with a few inconspicuous hairs and extends well beyond the petals. Flowering time is from May to September or October. The short, greyish leaves and softly hairy sepals and petals distinguish this species from similar verticordias. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia helichrysantha was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1867 and the description was published in George Bentham's Flora Australiensis. The type collection was made by George Maxwell. Mueller did not explain the choice of the specific epithet (helichrysantha), but it may have been given because of a similarity of the flowers of this species to the small-flowered species of Helichrysum (since separated into 'Helichrysum, Schoenia, Argentipallium and Bracteantha). When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Verticordia along with V. crebra, V. harveyi, V. plumosa, V. stenopetala, V. sieberi, V. pityrhops and V. fimbrilepis. Distribution and habitat This verticordia grows in shallow sand over spongolite and limestone on coastal plains and cliffs, in coastal heath, usually with V. fastigiata and V. habrantha. Its distribution is restricted an area west of Mount Barren in the Fitzgerald River National Park to Cape Riche although it has been recorded once at a location near Kamballup in the Stirling Range. The species was recorded in 1965 by Kenneth Newbey but not seen again until 1982, when it was rediscovered by Norm Stevens. It only occurs in the Esperance Plains biogeographic region. Conservation Verticordia helichrysantha is classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and it has also been listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" (VU) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The species is known from five populations, one of which has not been seen since 1964 and another since 1986. The three remaining populations contain an estimated 25,000 mature plants. Although the risk from dieback disease is considered to be moderate, there are potential threats from land clearing, inappropriate fire regimes, mining and damage from four-wheel driving. Use in horticulture The pale foliage, pink flower buds and yellow flowers are attractive features of this verticordia but it has not often been grown in gardens. It is relatively easy to propagate from cuttings and is hardy in areas with winter rainfall.

Here he is depicted young. Salh depicted as a monk after abandoning his composing Salh d'Escola (; fl. 1195) was a troubadour from Bergerac in the Périgord, a former province of France.Bergerac is spelled Barjarac, Bragairac, or Brageirac in Occitan. The meaning of his name, also spelled Sail or Saill, uncertain; it may be an unusual given name. His surname, likewise, may be a family name, but there is no known location called \\"Escola\\" that could render it a toponymic. The entire name may be a nickname meaning \\"defector from school\\" or \\"escapee from the cloister\\" , indicating that he quit his education, either in a school or a monastery. On the other hand, it may signify a pedant. The details of Salh's life are provided in two main sources, one contemporaneous and one late. The first source is the poem \\"Pos Peire d'Alvernh′ a chantat\\" composed by the troubadour monk of Montaudon in 1195. In it he good-naturedly criticises a gallery of troubadour, each in turn, usually humorously. One of those criticised is Salh d'Escola. According to the monk, Salh was a jongleur who went to Bergerac and became a merchant. The later source is Salh's vida (a short biography), which probably relied on \\"Pos Peire d'Alvernh′\\" to piece together its story. According to the anonymous biographer, Salh was the son of a merchant and became a jongleur. He then went to Narbonne and stayed for a long time at the court of \\"Ainermada de Narbona\\", the Viscountess Ermengard of Narbonne. Upon her death (1197), Salh entered the cloister at Bergerac and abandoned his \\"inventing [songs] and singing\\". Only on work by Salh, a canso (love song), has been preserved: \\"Gran esfortz fai qui chanta ni.s deporta\\". It is an amorous confession to his lady for telling her to \\"die\\" in a moment of desperation or irritation. Notes Bibliography *Egan, Margarita, ed. The Vidas of the Troubadours.

Football career Ogilvie was born at 7 Doughty Street, Mecklenburgh Square, London, and was educated at Brentwood School before joining Upton Park in 1871. After two years with Upton Park, he joined Clapham Rovers in 1873. He made his solitary England appearance on 7 March 1874 against Scotland, playing as a defender. After \\"a most competitive game\\", Scotland won 2–1, with Robert Kingsford scoring England's goal in the 22nd minute, before the Scots scored twice. He was captain of the Clapham Rovers team that reached the FA Cup final twice, losing 1–0 to Old Etonians in 1879, going on to win the cup in 1880 with a 1–0 win over Oxford University at The Kennington Oval. Ogilvie served on the F.A. committee between 1874 and 1881 and again between 1884 and 1886. He was also referee for the match between England and Scotland played at the Kennington Oval on 3 March 1877. England lost the match 3–1; this was England's first defeat on 'home soil'. Professional career In his professional life, Ogilvie was a member of Lloyd's of London, becoming chairman of the Institute of Lloyd's Underwriters from 1910–1911. He worked as an underwriter for the Alliance Assurance Company until 1914. Throughout World War I, he served with the War Risks department. Ogilvie died on 7 March 1938 aged 85 at Golf Cottage, St John's, Woking, Surrey. He also at the time had a home at 18 Sheffield Terrace, Campden Hill, London.

The photographs show a Malawi eyebiter (Dimidiochromis compressiceps). Pharyngeal jaws are a \\"second set\\" of jaws contained within an animal's throat, or pharynx, distinct from the primary or oral jaws. They are believed to have originated as modified gill arches, in much the same way as oral jaws. Originally hypothesized to have evolved only once, current morphological and genetic analyses suggest at least two separate points of origin. Based on connections between musculoskeletal morphology and dentition, diet has been proposed as a main driver of the evolution of the pharyngeal jaw. A study conducted on cichlids showed that the pharyngeal jaws can undergo morphological changes in less than two years in response to their diet. Fish that ate hard shelled prey had a robust jaw with molar-like teeth fit for crushing their durable prey. Fish that ate softer prey, on the other hand, exhibited a more slender jaw with thin, curved teeth used for tearing apart fleshy prey. These rapid changes are an example of phenotypic plasticity, wherein environmental factors affect genetic expression responsible for pharyngeal jaw development. Studies of the genetic pathways suggest that receptors in the jaw bone respond to the mechanical strain of biting hard- shelled prey, which prompts the formation of a more robust set of pharyngeal jaws. Cichlids A notable example are fish from the family Cichlidae. Cichlid pharyngeal jaws have become very specialized in prey processing and may have helped cichlid fishes become one of the most diverse families of vertebrates. However, later studies based on Lake Victoria cichlids suggest that this trait may also become a handicap when competing with other predator species. Moray eels Most fish species with pharyngeal teeth do not have extendable pharyngeal jaws. A particularly notable exception is the highly mobile pharyngeal jaw of the moray eels. These are possibly a response to their inability to swallow as other fishes do by creating a negative pressure in the mouth, perhaps induced by their restricted environmental niche (burrows). Instead, when the moray bites prey, it first bites normally with its oral jaws, capturing the prey. Immediately thereafter, the pharyngeal jaws are brought forward and bite down on the prey to grip it; they then retract, pulling the prey down the moray eel's gullet, allowing it to be swallowed. Popular culture The exceptional mobility of the moray eel's pharyngeal jaws was discovered in 2007 by UC Davis scientists. Almost three decades before (1979), the fictional xenomorph creature from Alien series was first depicted showing a second set of jaws for attacking its prey. However, at that time pharyngeal jaws in other fishes were already known.

History  Originally, Winter performed English pop music with CRY, a band formed in 1993. The CRY album \\"Invisible Tears\\", released in 1995, included the Belgian radio hit \\"Longing for Fire\\". It was not until 2001, when a friend discovered some old recordings in a box and after listening to them, suggested Markus record them 1, that he formed HERTzTON in the same year. Das Album (The Album) was released the following year with Eiszeit im Paradies becoming somewhat of a local club favourite. Due to a conflict of interests the original lineup disbanded before the official release of Das Album. Winter quickly recruited two new members to complete the line up, Jürgen Zass (bass, backing vocals) and Olaf Ginko (drums). The band completed several tours in 2003 and 2004 to promote Das Album. At the end of 2004, Zass and Ginko would depart the band for personal reasons 1. It was not until 2006 that Winter, along with session players Jonas Bentin (Keyboards, Programming) and Milly Snow (Drums) did HERTzTON record its second, and most successful album to date, Schattentänzer (Shadowdancer). In November, 2006, HERTzTON'S third and final album to date, Metamorphose (Metamorphosis) was released as a worldwide Download. The album is composed of remixed tracks from the first two albums, arranged in a way to show the band's musical 'metamorphosis' during its four-year existence. A photo montage depicting front man, Winter from 2001 - 2007 adorns the cover and shows his physical metamorphosis during the same time. The EP Die siebte Sünde (The seventh Sin) was released in August 2007 containing an exclusive remix of Schattentänzer that was done for an audio play series called DiE DR3i that Markus was writing for at the time.

By 1989 nearly 10 percent of government employees were women, and the top civil service examination graduate in 1989 was a woman. During their government careers, women civil servants were allowed three months maternity leave with full pay for three deliveries and leave without pay for any additional deliveries. Reflecting the dominance of males in society, girls were outnumbered three to two in primary and secondary-level schools. With many pro-women organizations on the rise including CSO, MBO etc. women have been seen to be contributing towards livelihoods of individual families. For instance SABAH-Bhutan tries to empower women in earning through weaving, tailoring food processing and other economic activities, thereby making women participate in earning for the family(s). Political participation Between 2008 and 2011, recruitment and retention of Tshogpas, or local government council members, remained a serious issue. Obstacles range from lack of interest and lack of economic incentives to difficulty in compliance and obtaining accreditation under existing election laws. The functional literacy and skills test alone left many constituencies without the minimum of two candidates, leading to lengthy delay of the local government elections of 2011, originally slated for 2008. The first round of the functional literacy and skills test left many Gewogs with no representatives, though second round results showed a pass rate over 90%. Although women elected to office remained relatively few (14% before local elections according to the UNHCR), more than half of voters in initial local government elections were women. In initial local-level voting in 2011, voter turnout was about 50%. This has raised the question of whether women would benefit from quotas in public service, highlighting the need to encourage further female electoral and political participation. History Women in the 1980s played a significant role in the agricultural work force, where they outnumbered men, who were leaving for the service sector and other urban industrial and commercial activities. In the mid-1980s, 95 percent of all Bhutanese women from the ages of fifteen to sixty-four years were involved in agricultural work, compared with only 78 percent of men in the same age range. Foreign observers have noted that women shared equally with men in farm labor. Overall, women were providing more labor than men in all sectors of the economy. Less than 4 percent of the total female work force was unemployed, compared with nearly 10 percent of men who had no occupation. The government founded the National Women's Association of Bhutan (which Dawa Dem helped establish) in 1981 primarily to improve the socioeconomic status of women, particularly those in rural areas. The association, at its inaugural session, declared that it would not push for equal rights for women because the women of Bhutan had already come to \\"enjoy equal status with men politically, economically, and socially.\\" To give prominence to the association, the Druk Gyalpo's sister, Ashi Sonam Chhoden Wangchuck, was appointed its president. Starting in 1985, the association became a line item in the government budget and was funded at Nu2.4 million in fiscal year 1992. The association has organized annual beauty contests featuring traditional arts and culture, fostered training in health and hygiene, distributed yarn and vegetable seeds, and introduced smokeless stoves in villages. =Traditional marriage and family life= The traditional practice, arranged marriages based on family and ethnic ties, had been replaced in the late twentieth century with marriages based on mutual affection. Marriages were usually arranged by the partners in contemporary Bhutan, and the minimum age was sixteen for women and twenty-one for men. The institution of child marriage, once relatively widespread, largely declined as Bhutan modernized, and there were only remnants of the practice in the late twentieth century. Interethnic marriages, once forbidden, were encouraged in the late 1980s by an incentive of a Nu10,000 government stipend to willing couples. The stipend was discontinued in 1991. Marriages of Bhutanese citizens to foreigners have been discouraged. Bhutanese with foreign spouses were not allowed to obtain civil service positions and could have their government scholarships cancelled and be required to repay portions already received. Foreign spouses were not entitled to citizenship by right but had to apply for naturalization. Polyandry is rare and can still be found for instance among the Brokpas of Merak- Sakten.\\"Feature: All in the Family\\", Kuensel 27 August 2007; http://www.kuenselonline.com/feature-all-in-the-family/ A woman married by custom to several husbands will, however, be granted only one marriage certificate according to law.The Marriage Act of Bhutan 1980, article KHa 1-17; http://landwise.landesa.org/record/733 Polygamy in Bhutan was restricted in the mid-twentieth century. Through the 1990s the law still allowed a man as many as three wives, providing he had the first wife's permission. The first wife also had the power to sue for divorce and alimony if she did not agree. In the 1980s, divorce was common, and newer laws provided better benefits to women seeking alimony. Family life, both traditionally and through the end of the 20th century, was likely to provide for a fair amount of self-sufficiency. Families, for example, often made their own clothing, bedding, floor and seat covers, tablecloths, and decorative items for daily and religious use. Wool was the primary material, but domestic silk and imported cotton were also used in weaving colorful cloth, often featuring elaborate geometric, floral, and animal designs. Although weaving was normally done by women of all ages using family-owned looms, monks sometimes did embroidery and appliqué work. In the twentieth century, weaving was possibly as predominant a feature of daily life as it was at the time of Bhutan's unification in the seventeenth century. Landholdings varied depending on the wealth and size of individual families, but most families had as much land as they could farm using traditional techniques. A key element of family life was the availability of labor. Thus, the choice of the home of newlyweds was determined by which parental unit had the greatest need of supplemental labor. If both families had a sufficient supply of labor, then a bride and groom might elect to set up their own home.< See also * Kunzang Choden, Bhutanese author who focuses on the experience of women * Polygamy in Bhutan * Night hunting, traditional \\"courtship\\" practice * Abortion in Bhutan References  External links  Bhutan ","title":"Women in Bhutan"},{"id":"16084282","text":"In proof theory, ordinal analysis assigns ordinals (often large countable ordinals) to mathematical theories as a measure of their strength. If theories have the same proof-theoretic ordinal they are often equiconsistent, and if one theory has a larger proof-theoretic ordinal than another it can often prove the consistency of the second theory.  History  The field of ordinal analysis was formed when Gerhard Gentzen in 1934 used cut elimination to prove, in modern terms, that the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic is ε0. See Gentzen's consistency proof. Definition Ordinal analysis concerns true, effective (recursive) theories that can interpret a sufficient portion of arithmetic to make statements about ordinal notations. The proof- theoretic ordinal of such a theory T is the smallest ordinal (necessarily recursive, see next section) that the theory cannot prove is well founded--the supremum of all ordinals \\\\alpha for which there exists a notation o in Kleene's sense such that T proves that o is an ordinal notation. Equivalently, it is the supremum of all ordinals \\\\alpha such that there exists a recursive relation R on \\\\omega (the set of natural numbers) that well-orders it with ordinal \\\\alpha and such that T proves transfinite induction of arithmetical statements for R. Upper bound The existence of a recursive ordinal that the theory fails to prove is well-ordered follows from the \\\\Sigma^1_1 bounding theorem, as the set of natural numbers that an effective theory proves to be ordinal notations is a \\\\Sigma^0_1 set (see Hyperarithmetical theory). Thus the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory will always be a (countable) recursive ordinal, that is, less than the Church–Kleene ordinal \\\\omega_1^{\\\\mathrm{CK}}.

It is the application of these principles that varies from group to group; and there is a wide range of standards set for accepted female behavior, as well as differences in male attitudes toward correct treatment of women. Contradictions arise between traditional customary practices, many of which impinge on the rights of women and are alien to the spirit of Islam, the other functioning canon which emphasizes equality, justice, education and community service for both men and women. Further, the dictates of Islam are themselves subject to diverse interpretation among reformists and Islamists.Nancy Hatch Dupree and Thomas E. Gouttierre. \\"Gender Roles\\". Afghanistan country study. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1997). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Gender reform was central to the contentious issues which brought about the fall of King Amanullah in 1929. In 1959, the male-oriented government of Prime Minister Daud Khan supported the voluntary removal of the veil and the end of seclusion for women. The 1964 Constitution automatically enfranchised women and guaranteed them the right to education and freedom to work. History For thirty years after 1959 growing numbers of women, most from urban backgrounds, functioned in the public arena with dignity, with no loss of honour to themselves or to their families. Nevertheless, family pressures, traditional attitudes and religious opposition continued to impose constraints which limited the degree to which women could find self-expression and control their lives. Except in Kabul where women under the PDPA were encouraged to assume more assertive public roles, this evolutionary movement came to a halt in 1978. Conservative mujahidin leaders waging a jihad (struggle) against foreign encroachment, both military and ideological, were imbued with the belief that sexual anarchy and social ruin would result if women continued to move freely in public. These attitudes intensified under the Taliban. Mostly rural Pushtun from strongly patriarchal backgrounds, the Taliban projected ultraconservative interpretations of Islam and apply customary practices as societal ideals. In 1996, gender issues were again at the centre of heated debate. Women All agree that differences between men and women exist and are best preserved through recognized standards of behavior. None dispute the centrality of women in the society. Respect for women is a notable characteristic and few wish to destroy this esteemed status, nor deny what Islam enjoins or Afghan culture values. The argument rages over definitions of precisely what constitutes honorable behavior for women in terms of modern realities, especially in the light of today's monumental reconstruction needs which demand full participation from every Afghan citizen. The current zealous need to protect women's morality stems from the fact that Afghan society regards women as the perpetrators of the ideals of the society. As such they symbolize honor—of family, community and nation—and must be controlled as well as protected so as to maintain moral purity. By imposing strict restraints directly on women, the society's most sensitive component symbolizing male honor, authorities convey their intent to subordinate personal autonomy and thereby strengthen the impression that they are capable of exercising control over all aspects of social behaviour, male and female. The practice of purdah, seclusion, (Persian, literally meaning curtain), including veiling, is the most visible manifestation of this attitude. This concept includes an insistence on separate spaces for men and women and proscriptions against interactions between the sexes outside the mahrammat (acceptable male guardians such as father, brother son and any other male with whom a woman may not marry). These restrictions severely limit women's activities, including access to education and employment outside the home. Many are largely confined to their homes. Such restrictions are deemed necessary by conservative males because they consider women socially immature, with less moral control and physical restraint; women's hypersexuality precludes responsible behavior. Consequently, women are untrustworthy and must be kept behind the curtain so as not to disrupt the social order. The need for their isolation therefore is paramount. = Roles for Women = The status and power of a girl increases as she moves from child to bride to mother to grandmother. A successful marriage with many sons is the principal goal of Afghan women, wholeheartedly shared by Afghan men. Women's nurturing roles are also crucial. This does not mean that women are confined to domestic roles. The stereotyping of Afghan women as chattel living lives of unremitting labor, valued by men solely for sexual pleasure and reproductive services is patently false. In Afghanistan, ranked the worst country in the world to be born a girl, some parents are bringing up their daughters as sons. Then comes puberty and the ‘bacha posh’ (Afghan girls raised as boys) are expected to switch back to their original gender role. Women's work varies from group to group. Among most settled rural families, women participate in agricultural work only during light harvesting periods, and are responsible for the production of milk products. Some specialize in handicrafts such as carpet and felt making. In contrast, Nuristani women plow the fields while the men herd the flocks and process the dairy products. Nomadic women care for young lambs and kids and make a wide variety of dairy products, for sale as well as family use. They spin the wool sheared by men and weave the fabric from which their tents are made. Felt-making for yurt coverings and household rugs ia also a female activity. When on the move, it is the women who put up and take down the tents. The variations are endless. Although statistics indicate that by 1978 women were joining the workforce in increasing numbers, only about eight percent of the female population received an income. Most of these women lived in urban centers, and the majority were professionals, technicians and administrators employed by the government which continued its strong support. A majority worked in health and education, the two sectors considered most appropriate for women as they are extensions of traditional women's roles. Others worked in the police, the army, and with the airlines; in government textile, ceramic, food processing and prefab construction factories. A few worked in private industry; a few were self-employed. The current revival of conservative attitudes toward appropriate extradomestic roles for women and the criticism of women's visibility in public has largely impacted these professional women. Islamic texts do not delineate roles for women. What they imply is open to interpretation. What they command is equality and justice guaranteeing that women be treated as in no way lesser than men. Educated Afghan women are standing fast in their determination to find ways in which they may participate in the nation's reconstruction according to their interpretations of Islam's tenets. This is a powerful challenge now facing the society. Private and Public Behaviour Afghan women view their sexuality more positively and question male maturity and self-control. In reality the differences between private and public behavior are significant. In private, there is a noticeable sharing of ideas and responsibilities and in many households individual charisma and strength of character surmounts conventional subordinate roles. Even moral misconduct can be largely overlooked until it becomes a matter of public knowledge. Then punishment must be severe for male and family honour must be vindicated. As a result, urban women are models of reticence in public and rural women appear submissive. A family's social position depends on the public behaviour of its female members. Stepping outside prescribed roles and behavioural norms in public results in moral condemnation and social ostracism. The dictates of society place a burden on both men and women to conform. Men Under such circumstances gender roles follow defined paths. Male prerogatives reside in family economic welfare, politics, and relationships with outsiders; within the family they are expected to be disciplinarians and providers for aged parents. Female roles stress motherhood, child socialization and family nurturing. Even among professional career women, family responsibilities remain a top priority. Thus women's self-perception of their roles, among the majority, urban and rural, contributes to the perpetuation of patriarchal values. Folklore Within the vast store of Afghan folktales covering religion, history and moral values, many reinforce the values governing male and female behavior. They illustrate what can or cannot be done, describe rewards and punishments, and define ideal personality types. Thus they perpetuate the existing gender order and through example make it psychologically satisfying. Consideration Some have urged the foreign aid community to revise aggressive campaigns to assure rights for Afghan women in education and employment. The Afghan community is already sharply divided over whether assistance to boys' education should be discontinued because there is a ban on education for girls. Family harmony must be undermined when women are favored over men in a declining job market.

Women officially gained equality under the 1964 constitution. However these rights were taken away in the 1990s through different temporary rulers such as the Taliban during civil war. Especially during the latter's rule, women had very little to no freedom, specifically in terms of civil liberties. Ever since the Taliban regime was removed in late 2001, women's rights have gradually improved under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and women are once again de jure equal to men under the 2004 constitution, which was largely based on that from 1964. However, their rights are still complicated by a reactionary view on women by certain classes of school, particularly ruralites, which continue to cause international concern. Overview Afghan women in Kabul entering a bus during the 1950s Women weaving on a loom in Afghanistan, c. 1939; women have traditionally performed weaving work in the country Afghanistan's population is roughly 34 million. Of these, 15 million are male and 14.2 million are female. About 22% of the Afghan people are urbanite and the remaining 78% live in rural areas. As part of local tradition, most women are married soon after completing high school. Many live as housewives for the remainder of their lives. Some Rulers of Afghanistan have consistently attempted to increase women's freedom. For the most part, these attempts were unsuccessful. However, there were a few leaders who were able to make some significant changes. Among them was King Amanullah, who ruled from 1919 to 1929 and made some of the more noteworthy changes in an attempt to unify as well as modernize the country. He, along with other rulers following him, promoted freedom for women in the public sphere in order to lessen the control that patriarchal families exerted over women. King Amanullah stressed the importance of female education. Along with encouraging families to send their daughters to school, he promoted the unveiling of women and persuaded them to adopt a more western style of dress. In 1921, he created a law that abolished forced marriage, child marriage, and bride price, and put restrictions on polygamy, a common practice among households in the Afghanistan region. Over time these restrictions became nearly impossible to enforce. Modern social reform for Afghan women began when Queen Soraya, wife of King Amanullah, made rapid reforms to improve women's lives and their position in the family. She was the only woman to appear on the list of rulers in Afghanistan and was credited with having been one of the first and most powerful Afghan and Muslim female activists. Queen Soraya, along with her husband's, advocacy of social reforms for women led to a protest and contributed to the ultimate demise of her and her husband's reign in 1929. Successors Mohammed Nadir Shah and Mohammed Zahir Shah acted more cautiously, but nevertheless worked for the moderate and steady improvement of women's rightsChildren of Afghanistan: The Path to Peace by Jennifer Heath, Ashraf Zahedi Throughout the 20th century, men maintained over women. Following the election of Mohammed Daoud Khan as Prime Minister in 1953, social reforms giving women a more public presence were encouraged. One of his aims was to break free from the ultra- conservative, Islamist tradition of treating women as second-class citizens. During his time, he made significant advances towards modernization. Small numbers of women were able to hold jobs as scientists, teachers, doctors, and civil servants, and they had a considerable amount of freedom with significant educational opportunities. The 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan granted women equal rights including universal suffrage and the right to run for office. However, the majority of women continued to be excluded from these opportunities, as these reforms had little effect outside of cities. The countryside was a deeply patriarchal, tribal society. In 1977, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) was founded by Meena Keshwar Kamal. Her office was moved to Quetta in Pakistan, where she was assassinated in 1987. RAWA still operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. = Afghan Women's Council = A teacher at a college in Kabul in 1987 The Afghan Women's Council (AWC) was an organization under the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978–87) and the Republic of Afghanistan (between 1987-1992). Until 1989, the AWC was led by Masuma Esmati-Wardak and run by a staff of eight women. In 1978, the government, led by Nur Muhammad Taraki, gave equal rights to women. This gave them the theoretical ability to choose their husbands and careers. The AWC had around 150,000 members and offices in nearly all the provinces. The AWC provided social services to women in Afghanistan, in the fought against illiteracy and provided vocational training in the secretarial, hairdressing and manufacturing fields. Many feared the sacrificing of the AWC in the national reconciliation talks which started in 1987. It is claimed that in 1991 around seven thousand women were in the institution of higher education and around 230,000 girls studying in schools around Afghanistan. There were around 190 female professors and 22,000 female teachers. =Mujahideen and Taliban era= In 1992, the government under Mohammad Najibullah transitioned to the Islamic State of Afghanistan. War in Afghanistan continued into a new phase when Gulbuddin Hekmatyar started a bombardment campaign against the Islamic State in Kabul. The restrictions imposed when the Islamic State was established were \\"the ban of alcohol and the enforcement of a sometimes-purely-symbolic veil for women\\". Women, however, remained in the workplace and the liberal provisions of the 1964 constitution were largely upheld. Women began to be more restricted after Hekmatyar was integrated into the Islamic State as Afghan Prime Minister in 1996. He demanded for women who appeared on TV to be fired. During the violent four-year civil war a number of women had been kidnapped and some of them raped. During this period the Taliban made their way to take control of Kabul. Taliban religious police beating a woman in Kabul filmed by RAWA on 26 August 2001. Like their leader Mullah Omar, most Taliban soldiers were poor villagers educated in Wahhabi schools in neighboring Pakistan. Pakistani Pashtuns also joined the group. The Taliban declared that women were forbidden to go to work and that they were not to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male family member. When they did go out, they were required to wear an all- covering burqa. Women were denied formal education and usually forced to stay at home. During the Taliban's five-year rule, women in Afghanistan were essentially put under house arrest, and often forced to paint their windows over so that no one could see in or out. Some women who once held respectable positions were forced to wander the streets in their burqas selling everything they owned or begging in order to survive. The United Nations refused to recognize the Taliban government, with the United States imposing heavy sanctions, leading to extreme economic hardship. Because most teachers had been women before the Taliban regime, the new restrictions on women's employment created a huge lack of teachers, which put an immense strain on the education of both boys and girls. Although women were banned from most jobs, including teaching, some women in the medical field were allowed to continue working. This is because the Taliban required that women could be treated only by female physicians. Several Taliban and Al-Qaeda commanders engaged in human trafficking, abducting women and selling them into forced prostitution and slavery in Pakistan. Time Magazine writes: \\"The Taliban often argued that the brutal restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex. The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim.\\" =21st century= A group of Afghan women visiting the Gardens of Babur in Kabul Sahraa Karimi was appointed the first female general director of Afghan Film in 2019. In late 2001, a new government under Hamid Karzai was formed by the United Nations, which includes women like in pre-1990s Afghanistan. Under the new constitution of 2004, 27 percent of the 250 seats in the House of the People are reserved for women. In March 2012, President Karzai endorsed a \\"code of conduct\\" which was issued by the Ulema Council. Some of the rules state that \\"women should not travel without a male guardian and should not mingle with strange men in places such as schools, markets and offices.\\" Karzai said that the rules were in line with Islamic law and that the code of conduct was written in consultation with Afghan women's group.\\" Rights organizations and women activists said that by endorsing this code of conduct, Karzai is endangering \\"hard-won progress in women's right since the Taliban fell from power in 2001. The BBC reported that a number of women have reacted to the endorsement with humor. The overall situation for Afghan women has improved in the last decade, particularly in the major urban areas, but those living in rural parts of the country still face many problems. In 2013, a female Indian author Sushmita Banerjee was killed in Paktika province by militants for allegedly defying Taliban diktats. She was married to an Afghan businessman and had recently relocated to Afghanistan. Earlier she had escaped two instances of execution by the Taliban in 1995 and later fled to India. Her account of the escape became a Bollywood film, Escape from Taliban. A 2011 government report found that 25 percent of the women and girls diagnosed with fistula were younger than 16 when they married. In 2013, the United Nations published statistics showing a 20% increase in violence against women, often due to domestic violence being justified by conservative religion and culture. In February 2014, Afghanistan passed a law that includes a provision that limits the ability of government to compel some family members to be witnesses to domestic violence. Human Rights Watch described the implementation of the 2009 Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women as \\"poor,\\" noting that some cases are ignored. Under Afghan law, females all across the country are permitted to drive vehicles. They are also permitted to participate in certain international events such as Olympic Games and robot competitions. Human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom have expressed concern at women's rights in the country. Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security ranks Afghanistan as one of the worst countries for women. According to the new law signed by Ashraf Ghani president of Afghanistan, Afghan women were allowed to include their names on their children’s birth certificates and identification cards. This law served as a major victory for Afghan women’s rights activists, who campaigned under the social media hashtag #WhereIsMyName, for several years for both the parents’ names to be included..  Violence against Afghan women  Many women in Afghanistan experience some form of abuse. Some have been imprisoned for minor offenses. The perpetrators are often the families of the victim. In Afghanistan, customs and traditions influenced by centuries-old patriarchal rules prevail, the issue of violence against women becomes pronounced. The high levels of illiteracy rates among the population further perpetuates the problem. A number of women across Afghanistan believe that it is acceptable for their husbands to abuse them. Reversing this general acceptance of abuse was one of the main reasons behind the creation of the EVAW. In 2009, the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) was signed into law. The EVAW was the creation of multiple organizations as well as prominent women's rights activists in Kabul (namely UNIFEM, Rights & Democracy, Afghan Women's Network, the Women's Commission in the Parliament and the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs. In March 2015 Farkhunda Malikzada, a 27-year-old Afghan woman was publicly beaten and slain by an angry mob of radical Muslims in Kabul on a false accusation of Quran desecration. A number of prominent public officials turned to Facebook immediately after the death to endorse the heartless lynching. It was later revealed that she did not burn the Quran. In 2018, Amnesty International reported that violence against women was perpetrated by both state and non- state actors. In April 2020, HRW reported that women with disabilities in Afghanistan face all forms of discrimination and sexual harassment while accessing government assistance, health care and schools. The report also detailed everyday barriers that women and girls face in one of the world’s poorest countries. On August 14, 2020, Fawzia Koofi, member of Afghanistan’s peace negotiating team, got wounded in an assassination attempt near the capital, Kabul, while returning from a visit to the northern province of Parwan. Fawzia Koofi is a part of a 21-member team charged with representing the Afghan government in upcoming peace talks with the Taliban. = Honor killing = In 2012, Afghanistan recorded 240 cases of honor killings. Of the reported honor killings, 21% were committed by the victims' husbands, 7% by their brothers, 4% by their fathers, and the rest by other relatives. In May 2017, United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan concluded that the vast majority of perpetrators of honor killings were not punished. Politics and workforce U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton standing with Afghan female politicians, which includes Sima Samar to her left, Fauzia Koofi(with the green headscarf) to her right, and Selay Ghaffar to her farest right. A large number of Afghan women serve as members of parliament. Some of these included Shukria Barakzai, Fauzia Gailani, Nilofar Ibrahimi, Fauzia Koofi, and Malalai Joya. Several women also took positions as ministers, including Suhaila Seddiqi, Sima Samar, Husn Banu Ghazanfar, and Suraya Dalil. Habiba Sarabi became the first female governor in Afghanistan. She also served as Minister of Women's Affairs. Azra Jafari became the first female mayor of Nili, the capital of Daykundi Province. As of December 2018, Roya Rahmani is the first-ever female Afghan ambassador to the United States. In September 2020, Afghanistan has secured a seat on the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women for the first time, an achievement that is seen as a “sign of progress for a country once notorious for the oppression of women”. Female officers of the Afghan National Police Machine embroidery is very popular in Afghanistan, almost every household owns a sewing machine. Colonel Latifa Nabizada of the Afghan Air Force in 2013 Brigadier-General Khatool Mohammadzai of the Afghan National Army in 2012 The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), which includes the Afghan National Police, have a growing number of female officers. One of the Afghan National Army Brigadier generals is Khatol Mohammadzai. In 2012, Niloofar Rahmani became the first female pilot in the Afghan Air Force pilot training program to fly solo in a fixed-wing aircraft, following the footsteps of Colonel Latifa Nabizada, the first Afghan female pilot ever to fly a military helicopter. Other notable Afghan women include Roya Mahboob, Aziza Siddiqui, Mary Akrami, Suraya Pakzad, Wazhma Frogh, Shukria Asil, Shafiqa Quraishi, Maria Bashir, Maryam Durani, Malalai Bahaduri, and Nasrin Oryakhil. The most popular traditional work for women in Afghanistan is tailoring, and a large percentage of the population are professional tailors working from home.Afghan women struggle to make ends meet as tailors Since the fall of the Taliban, women have returned to work in Afghanistan. Some became entrepreneurs by starting businesses. For example, Meena Rahmani became the first woman in Afghanistan to open a bowling center in Kabul.In Kabul, a bowling center offers respite from war Many others are employed by companies and small businesses. Some engaged in singing, acting, and news broadcasting. In 2015, a 17-year-old Negin Khpolwak became Afghanistan's first female music conductor. In 2014, women made up 16.1% of the labor force in Afghanistan. Because the nation has a struggling economy overwhelmed with massive unemployment, women often cannot find work where they receive sufficient pay. One area of the economy where women do play a significant role is in agriculture. Of the number of Afghans employed in the agriculture field or similar occupations, about 30 percent of them are women. In some areas in Afghanistan, women may spend as much time working on the land as men do, but still often earn three times less than men in wages. In terms of percentage, women rank high in the fields of medicine and media, and are slowly working their way into the field of justice. Because women are still highly encouraged to consult a female physician when they go to the hospital, nearly fifty percent of all Afghans in the medical profession are women. The number of women having professions in the media is also rising. It was reported in 2008 that nearly a dozen of television stations had all female anchors as well as female producers. As women are given more opportunities in education and the workforce, more of them are turning towards careers in medicine, media, and justice. However, even the women that are given the opportunity to have careers have to struggle to balance their home life with their work life, as household tasks are seen as primarily female duties. Since the Afghan economy is weak, very few women can afford to hire domestic helpers, so they are forced to take care of all the household work primarily on their own. Those who choose to work must labour twice as hard because they are essentially holding two jobs. Education Female students using the Internet at Herat University in the western Afghan city of Herat. Female school students in Samangan Province (2006) Education in Afghanistan has gradually improved in the last decade but much more has to be done to bring it to the international standard. The literacy rate for females is merely 24.2%. There are around 9 million students in the country. Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females. Over 174,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country. About 21% of these are females. A biology class at Kabul University during the late 1950s or early 1960s. Female students in a classroom in 2012 In the early twentieth century, education for women was extremely rare due to the lack of schools for girls. Occasionally girls were able to receive an education on the primary level but they never moved past the secondary level. During Zahir Shah's reign (1933–1973) education for women became a priority and young girls began being sent to schools. At these schools, girls were taught discipline, new technologies, ideas, and socialization in society. Kabul University was opened to girls in 1947 and by 1973 there were an estimated 150,000 girls in schools across Afghanistan. Unfortunately, marriage at a young age added to the high drop out rate but more and more girls were entering professions that were once viewed as only being for men. Women were being given new opportunities to earn better lives for both themselves and their families. However, after the civil war and the takeover by the Taliban, women were stripped of these opportunities and sent back to lives where they were to stay at home and be controlled by their husbands and fathers. During the Taliban regime, many women who had previously been teachers began secretly giving an education to young girls (as well as some boys) in their neighborhoods, teaching from ten to sixty children at a time. The homes of these women became community homes for students, and were entirely financed and managed by women. News about these secret schools spread through word of mouth from woman to woman. Each day young girls would hide all their school supplies, such as books, notebooks and pencils, underneath their burqas to go to school. At these schools, young females were taught basic literary skills, numeracy skills, and various other subjects such as biology, chemistry, English, Quranic Studies, cooking, sewing, and knitting. Many women involved in teaching were caught by the Taliban and persecuted, jailed, and tortured. The Taliban are still opposed to education for Afghan boys and girls. They are burning down schools, killing students and teachers by all kinds of means, including chemical warfare. For example, in June 2012, fifteen suspects were detained by Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) \\"in connection with the serial anti-school attacks in northern Afghanistan.\\" The NDS believes that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence was behind the idea. During the same period, Pakistan has been refusing to deliver Afghan bound school text books. In 2015 the Kabul University began the first master's degree course in gender and women's studies in Afghanistan. Afghan women obtain education in Kazakhstan within the Kazakh-Afghan state educational programme sponsored by the Republic of Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan attaches great importance to empowering women and strengthening stability in Afghanistan. In September 2018, Kazakhstan reached an agreement with the European Union that the EU would contribute two million euros to train and educate Afghan women in Kazakhstan. In October 2019, Kazakhstan, the EU and the UNDP launched an education programme to train and educate several dozen Afghan women in Kazakh universities over the next five years. As of 2019, almost 900 graduates of Kazakhstan’s programme serve in top positions in the Afghan president’s office, government ministries, the border guards and police, while others work as respected doctors, engineers and journalists. Sport Women at a cycling rally in Kabul, 2018 In the last decade, Afghan women have participated in various types of sports including futsal, football, and basketball. In 2015 Afghanistan held its first marathon; among those who ran the entire marathon was one woman, Zainab, age 25, who thus became the first Afghan woman to run in a marathon within her own country. this is also followed by soccer and touch with the allowance of cricket. Marriage and parenting A mother with her child in Herat Province, 1939 Mother with her children on Mothers' Day in Kabul Marriages in Afghanistan are usually in accordance with Islam and Afghanistan culture. The legal age for marriage in Afghanistan is 16. Afghans marry each other based on religious sect, ethnicity, and tribal association. It is rare to see a marriage between a Sunni Pashtun and a Shia Hazara. The nation is a patriarchal society where it is commonly believed that elder men are entitled to make decisions for their families. A man can divorce without needing his wife's agreement, whereas the opposite is not true. The country has a high total fertility rate, at 5.33 children born/woman as of 2015. Contraception use is low: 21.2% of women, as of 2010/11. Arranged marriage is usually the only way in Afghanistan. After a marriage is arranged, the two families sign a contract that both parties are socially and culturally obligated to honor. It is common among low-income families for the groom to pay a bride price to the bride's family. The price is negotiated among the parents only. The bride price is viewed as compensation for the money that the bride's family has had to spend on her care and upbringing. Forced marriage is also reported in Afghanistan. In almost 50% of cases, the bride is younger than 18 and in 15% of marriages, the bride is younger than 15. Sometimes women resort to suicide to escape these marriages. In certain areas females are sometimes bartered in a method of dispute resolution called baad that proponents say helps avoid enmity and violence between families, although the females themselves are sometimes subject to considerable violence both before and after marrying into a family through baad. The practice of baad is considered illegal in Afghanistan. Under the Afghan law, \\"if a woman seeks a divorce then she has to have the approval of her husband and needs witnesses who can testify in court that the divorce is justified.\\" The first occurrence of a woman divorcing a man in Afghanistan was the divorce initiated by Rora Asim Khan, who divorced her husband in 1927.Rora Asim Khan (Aurora Nilsson): Anders Forsberg och Peter Hjukström: Flykten från harem, Nykopia, Stockholm 1998. . This was described as unique at the time it occurred, but this was an exception, as Rora Asim Khan was a foreign citizen, who obtained her divorce by assistance from the German embassy. While it is legal for male citizens to marry foreign non-Muslims, it is illegal for female citizens to do so, and Afghan law considers all Afghan citizens Muslim. Up until September 17, 2020 Afghan law dictated that only the father's name should be recorded on ID cards. President Ashraf Ghani signed into law an amendment long sought by women's rights campaigners since a campaign launched three years ago under the hashtag #WhereIsMyName which garnered high-profile support from celebrities and members of parliament.

Bangladeshi women have made significant progress since the country’s independence in 1971, where women in the region experienced increased political empowerment for women, better job prospects, increased opportunities of education and the adoption of new laws to protect their rights through Bangladesh's policies in the last four decades. Still, women in Bangladesh continue to struggle to achieve equal status to men due to societal norms that enforce restrictive gender roles as well as poor implementation of laws that were set to protect women. In legal matters, Bangladesh follows a mixed system, predominantly of common law inherited from its colonial past as well as some Islamic laws that mostly concern personal status issues. Politically, women have been comparatively prominent in the sphere: since 1988 the Prime Ministers elected were women, and the current Prime Minister, Speaker of Parliament, and the Leader of the Opposition are women as well as of 2020. History The extent to which women in the region in the past has varied over time, where the status of women varied between religious and ethnic groups, as well as across social classes. =Pre- Independence Era= Before the 20th century, women in this region, as well as in Bengal in general, experienced different levels of autonomy depending on where they lived. While women who lived in rural areas were able to roam around in groups and appear in public, those who lived in urban areas would have to observe purdah by covering up. Prevalent in both Hindu and Muslim families at the time, these middle-class and upper-class women were mostly homemakers who barely went outside; any occasional movement outside were done inside cloaked carriages. This was seen as a way to protect women from unknown dangers of urban areas by the patriarch of the house. However, purdah was not common among lower-class women. Polygamy was practiced in this region regardless of religion. Nevertheless, the practice was not common among the general populace and was more commonly observed in the aristocratic class; recent eras see a further decline in polygamous relationships. Historically, Sati was practiced in this region, mostly among the upper class, until the late 19th century. =Post-Independence Era= Available data on health, nutrition, education, and economic performance indicated that in the 1980s the status of women in Bangladesh remained considerably inferior to that of men. Women, in custom and practice, remained subordinate to men in almost all aspects of their lives; greater autonomy was the privilege of the rich or the necessity of the very poor. Most women's lives remained centred on their traditional roles, and they had limited access to markets, productive services, education, health care, and local government. This lack of opportunities contributed to high fertility patterns, which diminished family well-being, contributed to the malnourishment and generally poor health of children, and frustrated educational and other national development goals. In fact, acute poverty at the margin appeared to be hitting hardest at women. As long as women's access to health care, education, and training remained limited, prospects for improved productivity among the female population remained poor. About 82 percent of women lived in rural areas in the late 1980s. The majority of rural women, perhaps 70 percent, were in small cultivator, tenant, and landless households; many worked as labourers part- time or seasonally, usually in post-harvest activities, and received payment in kind or in meager cash wages. Another 20 percent, mostly in poor landless households, depended on casual labour, gleaning, begging, and other irregular sources of income; typically, their income was essential to household survival. The remaining 10 percent of women were in households mainly in the professional, trading, or large-scale landowning categories, and they usually did not work outside the home. The economic contribution of women was substantial but largely unacknowledged. Women in rural areas were responsible for most of the post-harvest work, which was done in the chula, and for keeping livestock, poultry, and small gardens. Women in cities relied on domestic and traditional jobs, but in the 1980s they increasingly worked in manufacturing jobs, especially in the readymade garment industry. Those with more education worked in government, health care, and teaching, but their numbers remained very small. Continuing high rates of population growth and the declining availability of work based in the chula meant that more women sought employment outside the home. Accordingly, the female labour force participation rate doubled between 1974 and 1984, when it reached nearly 8 percent. Female wage rates in the 1980s were low, typically ranging between 20 and 30 percent of male wage rates. In 2019 Bangladesh's highest court ruled that on marriage registration forms, a word used to describe unmarried women that can also mean \\"virgin\\" must be replaced with a word that only means \\"an unmarried woman\\". The official religion of Bangladesh is Islam with over 90% of the population being Muslim. Education and economic development =Education= Azimpur Girls' School in Bangladesh The literacy rate in Bangladesh is lower for females (55.1%) compared to males (62.5%) – 2012 estimates for population aged 15 and over. During the past decades, Bangladesh has improved its education policies; and the access of girls to education has increased. In the 1990s, girls' enrolment in primary school has increased rapidly. Although there is now gender parity in enrolments at the primary and lower secondary school level, the percentage of girls drops in the later secondary school years. =Workforce participation= Women in Bangladesh are engaged in many work activities, from domestic work inside the home, to outside paid work. Women's work is often undervalued and under-reported. =Land and property rights= Women's inheritance rights are poor: discriminatory laws and patriarchal social norms make it difficult for many women to have access to land. Most women inherit according to the local interpretations of Sharia Law. Crimes against women =Rape= Bengali settlers and soldiers in the Chittagong Hill Tracts have raped native Jumma (Chakma) women \\"with impunity\\" with the Bangladeshi security forces doing little to protect the Jummas and instead assisting the rapists and settlers. The indigenous Buddhist and Hindu Jummas of Sino-Tibetan background have been targeted by the Bangladeshi government with massive amounts of violence and genocidal policies as ethnic Bengali settlers swarmed into Jumma lands, seized control and massacred them with the Bangladeshi military engaging in mass rape of women, massacres of entire villages and attacks on Hindu and Buddhist religious sites with deliberate targeting of monks and nuns. =Child marriage= Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. The practice of dowry, although illegal, contributes to this phenomenon. 29% of girls get married before age 15 and 65% before the age of 18. Government action has had little effect, and has been contradictory: although the government has pledged to end child marriage by 2041, the Prime Minister in 2015 attempted to lower the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16. An exception to the law was instituted so that marriage at 16 is permitted with parental consent. =Domestic violence= In 2010, Bangladesh enacted the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2010.http://phrplanbd.org/attachments/article/42/DV%20Act_Engling%20Translation%20%28unofficial%29.pdf Domestic violence (DV) is accepted by a significant percentage of the population: in the 2011 DHS survey, 32.5% of women said that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife for specific reasons (the most common reason given was if the wife \\"argues with him\\" – at 22.4%). In recent years violence towards women, committed by men, has decreased significantly and is considerably low compared to south Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, and India. Violence towards women is a crime. Awareness needs to be raised to uphold women's human rights. =Dowry= Dowry violence is a problem in Bangladesh. The country has taken action against the practice of dowry through laws such as Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980; Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1982; and Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Ordinance, 1986. However, abuses regarding dowry continue, with the legal enforcement against dowry being weak. =Sexual harassment= Eve-teasing is a euphemism used throughout South Asia, in countries such as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh,\\"Eve-teasers beat dead youth in Dhaka\\", Daily Star, 11 October 2014. for public sexual harassment or molestation (often known as \\"street harassment\\") of women by men, where Eve alludes to the very first woman, according to the Biblical creation story. Sexual harassment affects many women in Bangladesh, especially teenage girls, where the girls are intimidated in the streets, are shouted obscenities at, laughed at, or grabbed by their clothes. Other concerns =Freedom of movement= Bangladeshi women and girls don't get the rights of freedom of movement everywhere as the men have, the society is based on patriarchal values and socially conservative policies towards women and girl's freedom. =Health= The maternal mortality rate in Bangladesh is 240 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010). Sexually transmitted infections are relatively common, although the rate of HIV/AIDS is low. A 2014 study found that Bangladeshi women' knowledge about different diseases is very poor. Bangladesh has recently expanded training programs of midwives to improve reproductive health and outcomes. =Family planning= Already in the 1990s, family planning was recognised as very important in Bangladesh.http://dspace.icddrb.org/dspace/bitstream/123456789/2561/1/Bangladesh+family+planning+programme,lesson+learned+and+direction+for+the+future,+monograph+6.pdf The total fertility rate (TFR) is 2.45 children born/woman (estimates as of 2014).

Cyprus women have made great advancements in their society not just pertaining to education and the workplace, but also more women are beginning to hold political offices as well. Population According to World Population Review, in 2014, the population in Cyprus was 1,153,058. Women make up 48.944% of the total population in Cyprus. History of Cypriot women Even at the beginning of the 1990s, Cypriot women were still burdened with the expectation of safeguarding the honor of the family. According to tradition, a woman's duty was to protect herself against all criticism of sexual immodesty. A study carried out in a farming community in the mid-1970s found that women were still expected to avoid any social contact with men that could be construed to have a sexual context. An expressed desire to participate in male society was seen to reflect poorly on a woman's honor, and virginity was seen by many villagers, both men and women, to be a precondition for marriage. The honor of a family, that is, the sense of dignity of its male members, depended on the sexual modesty and virtue of its women. These traditional attitudes have waned somewhat in recent decades, especially in urban areas, but were still prevalent in the early 1990s. Another indication of the conservative nature of Greek Cypriot society at the beginning of the 1990s was that the feminist movement in Cyprus was often the object of ridicule from both sexes. Nevertheless, women's increasing economic independence was a force for liberation in all sections of the population. Women in Cyprus roles have changes and altered over the years. In the past, Cyprus women's main expectations were to get married and have children. Their schooling was little to none and many women did not work outside their homes. If you ask a woman in Cyprus if her social role is different than that of men, many of them will disagree. Today, many Cyprus women have jobs outside of their homes and receive a higher education. Even so, women still continue to keep up with the domestic work that their home life requires of them. Something that hasn't changed in Cyprus is the idea that women should be seen not heard or listen rather than speak. Due to gender socialization, women in Cyprus are known to keep their goals and successes to themselves. Education At the beginning of the 20th century, the proportion of girls to boys enrolled in primary education was one to three. By 1943, some 80 percent of Cypriot girls attended primary school. When, in 1960, elementary education was made compulsory, the two sexes were equally enrolled. By the 1980s, girls made up 45 percent of those receiving secondary education. Only after the mid-1960s did women commonly leave Cyprus to receive higher education. In the 1980s, women made up about 32 percent of those studying abroad. Female employment The participation of Cyriot women in the workforce has been steadily increasing. In 1976 women's share in the workforce was 30 percent and a rise to 37 percent in 1985. Today women's share in the workforce is 44 percent. 62.1% of women between the ages of 15–64 years old are active in workforce. Cyprus has long had a high degree of female participation in the workforce. There were great changes in the nature of female employment. Women's share of the urban workforce rose from 22 percent to 41 percent, while their share of the rural workforce fell from 51 percent to 44.4 percent. The decline in rural areas stemmed from the overall shift away from agricultural work, where women's contribution had always been vital, to employment in urban occupations such as manufacturing and services. The occupational segregation of the sexes was still persistent in Cyprus at the beginning of the 1990s. Even though the participation of women in clerical jobs had more than doubled since the late 1970s, only one woman in fifteen was in an administrative or managerial position in 1985. Women's share of professional jobs increased to 39 percent by the mid-1980s, compared with 36 percent ten years earlier, but these jobs were concentrated in medicine and teaching, where women had traditionally found employment. In fields where men were dominant, women's share of professional positions amounted to only 11 percent, up from 8 percent in 1976. In the fields where women were dominant, men took just under half the professional positions. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement pertaining to the gender equality Cyprus women are experiencing in the workforce. Not only do Women represent 14.4% of high posts, women are also paid on average 24% less per hour compared to their male counterparts. The equal pay-equal work principal would help to solve this problem, but the women are generally in lower positions then men resulting in the unequal pay. According to the 2006 Population Census, the unemployment rate for women was 19%, whereas for men it was 6%. In 2010, the unemployment rate was 17.5% for women a and 8.9% for men. Even though the unemployment rate for women is decreasing, the rate is still twice as high compared to men. = Welfare = Cypriot women enjoy the same rights to social welfare as men in such matters as social security payments, unemployment compensation, vacation time, and other common social provisions. In addition, after 1985 women benefited from special protective legislation that provided them with marriage and maternity grants that paid them 75 percent of their insurable earnings. Still, a large number of women, including the self-employed and unpaid family workers on farms, were not covered by the Social Insurance Scheme. These women constituted 28 percent of the economically active female population. In 1985, the Republic of Cyprus ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. Despite ratification of this agreement, as of late 1990 there was no legislation in the Republic of Cyprus that guaranteed the right to equal pay for work of equal value, nor the right of women to the same employment opportunities.  Politics  Women are present in very few political positions in Cyprus, but the following are some of the women who have held or currently hold a political position: * Praxoula Antoniadou- President of the United Democrats (March 2007 – Present), She attends the meetings of the leaders of the Greek and Cypriot political parties as well as being an active participant. * Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis- Minister of Foreign Affairs (August 20111- February 2013), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1980-2007), Ambassador of the Republic of Cyprus to the United States of America (1998-2003) * Eleni Mavrou- First female mayor of Cyprus' capital (2006-2011), Minister of Interior of the Republic of Cyprus (until February 2013) * Antigoni Papadopoulou- First Woman to serve as Chair of the House’s Committee of Economic Affairs and Budgeting (2006–2009), President of GOIDK, Member of the Municipal Council of Strovolos, Member of the House of Representative of Cyprus, Mayor of Morphu, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Member of the European Parliament * Sibel Siber- Turkish Cypriot politician and the first Cypriot woman to serve as the Prime Minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 2013. As of November 2015, Siber serves as the Speaker of Parliament, the Republican Assembly of Northern Cyprus. * Androulla Vassiliou- European Commissioner for Health (March 2008- February 2010), European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth (February 2010-November 2014) Notable women * Caterina Cornaro- The last reigning Queen of Cyprus during the Lusignan/Venetian periods * Suzan Ari- Advocate for reform in Cyprus pertaining to education, social movements, and protecting cultural heritage * Lia Vissi- Singer, songwriter, and politician in Cyprus  Violence against women in Cyprus  Studies show that socioeconomic patterns play a big role in violence against women in Cyprus, specifically domestic violence. Women who possess characteristics such as having little to no education, reside in Urban areas, are of older age, and struggle financially are said to be prone to domestic violence. Due to there not being a national survey conducted focusing on domestic violence against women in Cyprus, statistics and findings can only be discovered through the police or through Association of the Prevention and Handling of Violence in the Family. The reports to the police have drastically been increasing each year. In 2002, 538 cases were reported, whereas in 2008 that number almost doubled with 969 cases being reported. During the years between 2002-2008, 71.18 percent of the victims were women. During the years between 2004-2009, the number of cases triples and 80 percent of victims are women, whereas 8.6% of victims are men. Of these cases, 79 percent involved physical violence, 18.5 percent involved psychological violence, and 2.4 percent involved sexual violence. The annual report from Association of the Prevention and Handling of Violence in the Family reveals that out of a total of 1051 incidents, 815 of them include women between the ages of 41-50 who were abused. Furthermore. 96.1 percent of these incidents involve psychological violence and 78 percent reside with their attacker. issue=v51i0002 article=295 Cyprus made marital rape illegal in 1994.

Originally of humble birth in the Shawaa zone, he was made a dejazmach. Balcha also became a provincial Governor (Shum), and was a renowned warrior under Emperor Menelik II, famously becoming one of the leaders in the Battle of Adwa. He later eventually became a key member of the conservative provincial elite who, in the 1920s, were often at odds with the modernising reforms and rising power of the Regent, Ras Tafari Makonnen (later Emperor Haile Selassie I). Tafari would force Dejazmach Balcha into retirement, albeit an honourable one, in 1928, from which he would emerge in 1935 to fight the Fascist invaders during which he was killed in 1936. Biography =Early career= Balcha was born in the Shawa Zone and was of Oromo origin.Journal of Ethiopian Studies, Vol. 9, No. 2 (JULY 1971), pp. 173-189 'Balcha' means 'taming, assimilating or making familiar with' in Oromo. Found on the battlefield after having been emasculated, which at the time was a tribal tradition of some the Oromo soldiers Menelick II upon the captured resistance militia of non-Amara ethnic groups, he came to the notice of Emperor Menelik II, who brought him back to Addis Ababa where he was educated.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 190 n. 8 He distinguished himself at the imperial court and showed particular skill in military exercises and theory. He made his reputation, according to oral tradition, in the Battle of Mek'ele,Harold G. Marcus, The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844–1913, (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), p. 166 and later at the Battle of Adwa (March 1, 1896), and was rewarded with elevation to the aristocratic status of dejazmach.Haile Selassie I. My Life and Ethiopia's Progress. Vol. 2, 1999, page 32. From 1898 to 1908, Balcha was Shum/Governor of Sidamo province. After the death of Dejazmach Yilma Mekonen in 1907, he became the Shum/Governor of Harar from 1910 to 1914. From 1917 to 1928, he again served as Shum/Governor of Sidamo. =Conflict with Haile Selassie= A conservative who had been loyal to the memory of the deceased Emperor Menelik, Balcha was one of the leading nobles who challenged the growing power of the regent Ras Tafari (who later became Emperor Haile Selassie). A blunt old warrior, he did not trust the young Emperor, who was an advocate for modernizing Ethiopia. In a deft political maneuver, which has since been seen as an example of Haile Selassie's genius, in 1928 the Emperor invited Balcha to the capital for a feast in Balcha's honor. Balcha arrived 11 February with several thousand men, and camped right outside of Addis Ababa at an area called Nifas Silk, and spent the evening \\"generally insolent and threatening in conversation.\\"Harold G. Marcus, Haile Sellassie I: the Formative Years (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996), p. 89 Ras Tafari was nervous in private. The Empress begged Balcha by the name of her late father Emperor Menelik II. Meanwhile, the regent sent Ras Kassa Haile Darge to Balcha's camp, where he lied to the troops stating that Balcha and Regent Ras Tafari were in agreement, and paid the soldiers Balcha had left there. At the same time the Emperor appointed Dejazmach Birru Wolde Gabriel to replace Balcha as governor of Sidamo. These simultaneous acts deprived Balcha of his ability to resist, a loss he discovered only after he returned to the camp.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch, 2003), pp. 7f; Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (London: James Currey, 2001), pp. 132f. Balcha promised a peaceful transition to the empress and lay down his sword, which was the traditional way of giving up his power in respect of the Empress.Marcus, Haile Sellassie, p. 90. Haile Selassie's bloodless victory over Balcha is presented as an example of concealing one's intentions in Robert Greene, The 48 Laws of Power (New York: Penguin, 1998), pp. 25–27 =Death= When Italy invaded in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Balcha Safo came out of retirement to fight against the Italians. Major Mesfin Seleshi, an agent of the imperial government in exile who was coordinating resistance in occupied Ethiopia, writes of his fate in a letter to Haile Selassie I thus: > The enemy went as far as አገምጃ, where his Excellency Dejazmatch Balcha lives, > and campaigned against him. The people betrayed him, and all his men were > annihilated. He and two of his servants, three people all together, were > surrounded. A white man came to him and asked, are you Dejazmatch Balcha? > When he said 'Yes I am', the white man said 'Surrender your arms, and untie > your pistol belt'.

Political representation =Operative legal framework= The current operating framework for women's rights in Jordan includes the Jordanian Constitution, a civil status code, the Personal Status Law and international law regarding human rights. Traditional and cultural ideals of femininity also effect how women are viewed and treated in Jordan.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 40 Women in Jordan, however, did not receive the right to vote until 1974. This was fairly late for the region, as Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen, Turkey and Iran had all granted women suffrage by 1967. The Jordanian Constitution was written in 1952 and states that all “Jordanians shall be equal before the law. There shall be no discrimination between them as regards their rights and duties on grounds of race, language or religion.” There are many constitutional provisions that affirm basic rights and political representation for all. For example, Article 22 states that each Jordanian has equal opportunity to be appointed to and serve in public office as such appointments “shall be made on the basis of merit and qualifications.” The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 41 An amendment on January 28, 2003 implemented the quota system in Jordanian parliament, and while a religious precedent exists for parliamentary seats in the constitution, allocating seats for women is new and shows that the government recognizes and is trying to break down the various barriers women face running for office. The Provisional Penal Code reduces sentencing for men who commit violent acts against women in the “honor” context. In the last decade, however, it has been amended. While the original code allowed men to implement the law themselves, the new amendment leaves punishment and sentencing to the judicial system of the state. In addition, there are no provisions under the Labor or Penal Codes to protect women against sexual harassment. This lack of legislation explicitly protecting women exposes them to harassment both at home and in the workplace. Jordan is a member of many international organizations that guarantee basic human rights to women.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 47 =Representation in elected office= Women protest in downtown Amman, 1968 While female participation in Jordanian parliament has increased over the past decade, it still remains low. Notwithstanding the 1974 law giving women the right to campaign and serve in office, few Jordanian women today are motivated to or feel comfortable running for political office, while even fewer are elected and ultimately serve. Current King of Jordan, His Majesty King Abdullah II, passed legislation requiring a quota for the number of women in parliament. Since the quota was established, 15 of the 130 seats in the Lower House of Parliament have consistently and successfully been reserved for women. However, women won 19 seats in the 2013 elections.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 50 On average, 16% of parliamentary seats are held by women globally. In Jordan, however, women only hold around six percent in the two parliamentary houses combined.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 51 Jordan is still working on women's representation in elected office, but as progressive policies continue to be proposed and adopted under King Abdallah, traditional gender roles and customary ideals of femininity and masculinity in Jordan will be challenged, decreasing inequalities between men and women. While only 6% of parliamentary seats are held by women, the Queen of Jordan has used her position and subsequent power to actively support the women's rights. Rania has been Queen since 1999 and is married to King ʿAbdullah II. Her family is of Palestinian descent (her father was from Ṭūlkarm, her mother from Nablus) and was born and raised in Kuwait. Rania is highly educated; she has a business administration degree from the American University in Cairo (1991) and before marrying King Abdullah II in January 1993, she worked as a banker. As Queen of Jordan, Rania has fought for a wide range of causes, including women's rights, access to education, environmental concerns, and the development of strong Jordanian communities. She is still incredibly active today. In March 2008, Rania launched a video blog as part of her efforts to deconstruct stereotypes about Arabs and promote dialogue with the West. =Jordanian National Commission for Women= The Jordanian National Commission for Women's (JNCW) mission is to “support mainstreaming of a gender-equality perspective in all policy areas and to narrow the gap between formal acknowledgement of women's rights as detailed by legislation and actual societal attitudes towards women through improving the status of women and enhancing their role in national development.” Mission.\\" Jordanian National Commission for Women. N.p., 18 Apr. 2012. Web. 15 Apr. 2012. . They work to equalize women's status – socially, politically and economically – in Jordan by proposing legislation and studying the existing policies regarding women's rights. The JNCW also works closely with various public institutions and NGO's in hopes of branching out and developing their organization. In 1996, the Jordanian cabinet made the JNCW the official government “reference point” on all issues pertaining to women and now reports directly to the Prime Minister. The JNCW has become a quasi- governmental institution accountable in large part for drafting national policies regarding women's rights and economic advancement.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 48 Social representation =Education= Jordan has the highest literacy rate in the Middle East. There are constitutional provisions that affirm Jordanian citizens’ basic rights to education. Article 20, in fact, makes elementary education required for all Jordanians and free of charge in public, government schools. This provision is elaborated on and reinforced in the Education Act. The Jordanian government spends more than 5% on education every year and has had positive results. Since 1980, the literacy rate in Jordan has increased from 69.2% to 91% in 2002. With a female literacy rate of 85.9%, Jordan has the highest female literacy rate in the Middle East.Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 3 So, while the majority of Jordanian women are both literate and well educated, the differences in career expectations based on gender stem from cultural practices and not the fact that women are not as capable as men. Female enrollment at all levels of school is high and Jordanian women have the highest average number of years of schooling in comparison with women in both Kuwait and Bahrain. While men in Jordan receive 1.7 years more schooling that women in Jordan receive, the difference is considered very low for the region.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 27 The drop out rate is not excessive, but women claim their primary reason for dropping out of school (at various levels) is marriage and their responsibilities in the home while men claim they drop out primarily to get jobs and help their families make money. Family approval of a woman's education is crucial. When a poorer family is unable to put more than one child through school, the boy gets the education and the girl is expected to focus on homemaking skills. While women have access to basic schooling, access to technological training is limited as women are expected to study topics that directly relate to their dominant roles as wives and mothers – such as art, humanities, and teaching.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 28 Though females are fairly equally represented in school, there is excessive gender stereotyping in Jordanian textbooks. =Employment= There are constitutional provisions that affirm Jordanian citizens’ basic rights to work and there is nothing in Islam that forbids women from doing so.Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 54 The Constitution states, \\"Work is the right of all citizens,\\" \\"Jobs are based on capability,\\" and \\"All Jordanians are equal before the law.Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 87 There will be no discrimination between Jordanians regarding rights and duties based on race, language or religion.\\" The Labor Laws clarify the Constitution further: \\"By Jordanians are meant both men and women.\\" The Labor Code defines a worker/laborer/employee as “each person, male or female, who performs a job in return for wages.” The Constitution asserts that the government “shall ensure work and education within the limits of its possibilities, and it shall ensure a state of tranquility and equal opportunities to all Jordanians.” Work is “the right of every citizen,” and “the State shall provide opportunities for work to all citizens by directing the national economy and raising its standards.” Jordanian labor laws protect women from losing their jobs during pregnancy and give them assistance with childcare. While the laws themselves promote justice and equality, the traditional ideals of masculinity and femininity and the \\"patriarchal nature of the legal system\\" contribute to women's noticeable absence from the workplace and the inequalities they face once there. Gender inequalities in Jordan today also stem from traditional gender roles that have embedded themselves in Jordanian culture. “At the root of the barriers to women's labor force participation are traditional attitudes that place a high value on women's roles in the private sphere and within the family that is important in Jordanian society.” These stereotypes are based on the notions that: “(a) men and women differ biologically and that these biological differences determine their social function; (b) men and women carry different and complementary responsibilities within the family; and (c) they have different but equitable rights associated with those responsibilities.” The \\"traditional paradigm\\" of Jordanian gender expects women to marry early and contribute to the family as a homemaker, wife and mother. It assumes that the man will be in charge of the household and that he will provide for his family financially. Women, as wives and mothers, are perceived as vulnerable and in need of protection that should be provided by the husband. Men's responsibility to protect their wives and children is considered sufficient justification for their exercise of authority over women in all areas of decision-making regarding both the public and private spheres. Due to this traditional paradigm, women's interaction with and representation in politics and society are mediated by her husband. While this paradigm exists to some extent all over the world, it is particularly prominent in Jordan as it has become institutionalized and pervades the legal framework. alt=Four women, one in a wheelchair and two wearing headscarves, sitting around a table assembling mosaics with tools and materials Unemployment, underemployment, differences in wages and occupational segregation are the four main factors in the economy that impact women's level of labor.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 10 In terms of unemployment, 15% of men are unemployed while 25% of women are unemployed and 82% of young women ages 15–29 are unemployed. Women are underemployed as they tend to be hired less than men with lesser education because large sections of the Jordanian economy are and have traditionally been closed off to women. Less educated men often hold more jobs while women are often better educated, leading to many women settling for jobs requiring lesser education than they have. Wage discrimination in Jordan is no different from anywhere else in the world, but in combination with traditional and cultural factors – like being responsible for the private sphere (the family and the home) – women are driven away from the workforce. Jordanian law suggests that wives should be obedient to their husbands because the men financially support the family, and if she is disobedient her husband can discontinue financial support.Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 15 In addition, men have assumed the power to forbid their wives from working, and the Jordanian courts have upheld these laws. Furthermore, as honor killings consistently occur and are currently on the rise, women are less motivated to leave the safety of their homes.Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 16 Laws in Jordan regarding honor killings continue to make it possible for courts to deal with perpetrators leniently. Occupational segregation exists in all aspect of the Jordanian workforce as both vertical and horizontal segregation is present.The Economic Advancement of Women in Jordan: A Country Gender Assessment. World Bank, May 2005. PDF file. Page 22 Vertical segregation refers to the concept of the glass ceiling, where women are concentrated in lower paying, lower-ranking jobs and cannot break through to the higher levels. Horizontal segregation occurs when certain occupations are more female intensive. For example, more Jordanian men are civil servants and fill high-ranking positions while Jordanian women are concentrated in middle-ranking jobs. The consequences of women's limited economic advancement and low female participation in the workforce leads to low utilization of national production capacity (World Bank estimates it is currently at half its potential), lower average household income and lower per capita GDP. The greatest challenge to incorporating women equally into the workplace is overcoming traditional attitudes towards women and their expected duties as mothers and wives. A change in attitude will inevitably lead to the changing of \\"gendered laws\\" and the role of women as homemakers.Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women of Jordan: Islam, Labor, & the Law. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2003. Print. Page 7 =Networking= The Islamic Center Charity Society in Jordan is an example of one way middle class Jordanian women are able to network and connect over mutual experiences. Instead of functioning like a traditional “charity,” these Islamic charity institutions are founded on a more social basis.Clark, Janine A. Islam, Charity, and Activism. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2004. Print While these they are not officially connected to the state, they impact the country both socially and politically. Other community groups in Jordan, like the Jordanian Hashemite Fund, encourage women to form their own committees, run for local elections, and form small female-only cooperatives. When many of these initiatives began in the 1980s, they received marked opposition from community leaders, with some threatening to shut down women's committees in their area. The current political landscape is comparatively more amenable to female political participation and networking, although challenges remain. Family rights =Marriage= Jordanian husbands determine their wives’ abilities to employ their constitutionally guaranteed rights to work and other public activities. Jordanian legislation and culture suggests that men have a certain control over their wives to mediate their interaction with the public. Men expect their wives to be obedient because they work in order to support the family financially. Some amendments postpone this “ownership” for young girls. For example, the Jordanian Parliament increased the legal age of marriage to 18 for both boys and girls, as the previous law set the legal age for marriage at 16 for boys and 15 for girls, which promoted early marriages and subsequent school drop out for married girls. =Divorce= Divorce law is based almost entirely on Islamic Shari'a law, which is considered \\"unquestionable authority.\\" Sonbol, Amira El-Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 10 Variations in interpretation and application, however, do exist among Islamic courts across the Middle East. Divorces in Jordan, in particular, often ignore women's rights and leave women with nothing if they are not supported by their families. In recent years, the government has worked to fix this problem by altering the judicial system. For example, \\"a new law has been drafted to force men to pay alimony for three years instead of six months, which was previously the case.” Because men are free to divorce and stop supporting their wives if they are \\"disobedient,\\" another law created an obligatory fund for divorced women, guaranteeing them a settlement from their ex- husband.Alami, Mona. \\"Women Make Progress But Honour Killings Persist.\\" IPS.

Page 226 Today, however, children \\"belong\\" to both parents but the mother generally stays home to raise the children. =Property= While studies of women and their property rights evidence that Islamic courts have \\"upheld women's rights to property,\\" women in Jordan legally own and inherit less than their male relatives do.Sonbol, Amira El- Azhary. Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1996. Print. Page 220 Throughout history and still today, when women have owned and inherited property, they have been frequently and intensely pressured to give up their land to male family members. As a result, less than four percent of all property in Jordan is owned by women. =Honor killings= Honor crimes are acts of violence committed by family members against women who are perceived to have shamed the family in some way. Women can \\"shame\\" their family by engaging in \\"marital infidelity, pre-marital sex and flirting\\", or getting raped Mayell, Hillary. Thousands of Women Killed for Family \\"Honor.\\" N.p.: National Geographic Society, February 12, 2002. National Geographic Society. Web. 17 Apr. 2012. Page 1. The Jordanian Penal Code today still includes provisions that excuse honor crimes by granting the perpetrator leniency in punishment. Many of these killings go unreported, but each year tens of women are killed by family members in order to \\"restore honor.\\" Honor killings occur across the Middle East and around the world. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights reports of honor killings in Bangladesh, Great Britain, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Morocco, Sweden, Turkey, and Uganda expose that this practice \\"goes across cultures and across religions.\\" It has been difficult to change legislation (particularly Article 340 of the Jordanian Penal Code) because violence against women has traditionally been considered a \\"private matter\\" rather than the \\"responsibility of the state.\\" In fact, there has been a nationwide women's human rights campaign, supported by King Abullah and Queen Rania, to modify Article 340, which grants perpetrators of honor killings leniency in Jordanian courts Ruane, Rachel A.

Their position in society has been and is influenced by a variety of factors, including local traditions and customs, decades of Soviet regime, rapid social and economic changes and instability after independence, and new emerging Western values. Historical Context Kazakhstan gained its independence in 1991, after being a part of the Soviet Union for more than 70 years. Following its independence, Kazakhstan's economy, being in a period of transition, experienced, particularly in the 1990s, a strong decline and destabilization: by 1995 real GDP dropped to 61,4% of its 1990 level, resulting also in a brain drain.http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/briefing_note/join/2013/522303/EXPO- INTA_SP%282013%29522303_EN.pdf This situation of economic depression, coupled with emerging traditionalist views on women's roles in society, has had a negative effect on women. Nevertheless, the 1990s also had some positives for women, such as the accession to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1998. After its independence, Kazakhstan inherited an education system which was quite developed, but during the period of transition, shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, the education sector suffered serious losses, was continuously under-funded, and school closures, especially in rural areas, were common. However, today the literacy rate of women in Kazakhstan is among the highest in the world at 99.8%, similar to that of men (as of 2015). The “Concept of state demographic policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan” was ratified in 2000, which prioritized demographic problems on the same line with national security issues. It allowed addressing the issues of population rise and women's rights in accordance with the long run political model \\"Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy.\\" Reproductive Health and Fertility The maternal mortality rate in Kazakhstan is 12 deaths/100,000 live births (2015 estimate). The total fertility rate is 2.31 children born/woman (as of 2015), which is slightly above the replacement rate. The contraceptive prevalence rate is 51% (2010/11). Forced Marriage and Bride Kidnapping Forced marriage and bride kidnapping are problems with which women and girls are confronted in Kazakhstan, although their exact prevalence is not known. In Kazakhstan, bride kidnapping (alyp qashu) is divided into non-consensual and consensual abductions, kelisimsiz alyp qashu (\\"to take and run without agreement\\") and kelissimmen alyp qashu (\\"to take and run with agreement\\"), respectively.Cynthia Werner, \\"The Rise of Nonconsensual Bride Kidnapping in Post-Soviet Kazakhstan\\", in The Transformation of Central Asia: States and Societies from Soviet Rule to Independence (Cornell University Press, 2004: Pauline Jones Luong, ed.), p. 70. Some kidnappers are motivated by the wish to avoid paying a bride price.Werner, pp. 71–72. Sex trafficking Citizen and foreign women and girls have been victims of sex trafficking in Kazakhstan. They are raped and physically and psychologically harmed in brothels, businesses, hotels, homes, and other locations throughout the country. Women's Rights The government reported to the United Nations their plan 2006-2016 Strategy for Gender Equality in Kazakhstan. In 2009 Kazakhstan introduced the law \\"On Prevention of Domestic Violence.\\" The law provides comprehensive measures to prevent all forms of violence against women. International Women's Day is an official state holiday in Kazakhstan. According to the “Youth of Central Asia. Kazakhstan” report prepared by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and Research Institute Public Opinion, 84.8% of the youth think women in Kazakhstan have enough rights. Kazakhstan was ranked 30th out of 144 countries in gender equality in a 2016 report conducted by nonprofit organization Save the Children. The ranking places Kazakhstan ahead of countries such as the U.S. and Japan. Kazakhstan ranked 51st out of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum's 2017 Gender Equality Index. Women in Government Women are increasingly holding high-ranking political and government positions. In December 2009 Kazakhstan adopted the law \\"On the state guarantees of equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women\\", which stipulates equal access of men and women to civil service. There are 28 women in Kazakhstan's 154-seat Parliament, and women represent 25.2 percent of the lower house of parliament. As of March 2017, the share of women in the lower house of parliament was 27%, which is 10% higher than ten years before. Kazakhstan's first female presidential candidate Daniya Yespayeva participated in the 2019 presidential election. Yespayeva was nominated from the Ak Zhol Democratic Party and was one of seven candidates.  Women in Law Enforcement and Military  Law enforcement and military careers are considered non- traditional fields for women. It is estimated that somewhere between 6-12% of police officers in Kazakhstan are women. In 1999 a dedicated domestic violence unit was established in Kazakhstan, but due to limited training and resources, this program did not meet expectations and local demand. Recently, Florida State University has been working with the Ministry of Interior of Kazakhstan and the Almaty City Police Department to provide high quality training on domestic violence. This program, funded by the US Department of State, has brought US-based experts on domestic violence response, researchers of gender issues and experts from local NGOs in Kazakhstan together to improve police training on domestic violence. There are approximately 8,000-8,500 women serving in the Kazakh army. Of those women, 750 are officers. The Ministry of Defence has been working to promote women in the military through educational programs and career advancement opportunities. Only 2.1% of leadership positions within the Ministry of Defence are held by women. The Ministry of Defence also hosts Batyr Arular, which is a nationwide competition for service men and women, showcasing their combat skills, combat readiness and overall physical ability. Batyr Arular gives awards for the best service women. Women in Business In Kazakhstan 28% of manufacturing firms have female ownership. 1.44 million women are engaged in business in Kazakhstan. 44% of the country's small and medium-sized businesses are now run by women. Kazakhstan's first women's NGO the Association of Business Women of Kazakhstan holds regular summits dedicated to women in business and women's rights. The IV Eurasian Women's Summit was held in Astana in November 2015. During the IV Eurasian Women's Summit, EBRD launched Women in Business programme. Under the programme, EBRD allocates multi-million loans to women-led SME's and assists them with accessing finance and business advice. The EBRD signed the first credit line under the programme in September 2016, providing 3.72 billion tenge (approximately US$20 million) to Bank CenterCredit for on-lending to women-led SMEs. As of 2019, the EBRD with partner financial institutions provided 21,281 sub-loans worth 28.9 billion tenge (US$76 million) to women- led enterprises in Kazakhstan. The EBRD also implements the Women in Microbusiness programme for 350 women entrepreneurs from 14 Kazakh regions to improve their access to efficient business tools and modernize how they do business. One of the sessions of Astana Economic Forum in 2015 was dedicated to the International Women's Forum organised by the Kazakh Association of Business Women (ABW). The session was specifically dedicated to the economic benefits of gender equality in Central Asia and Afghanistan. In 2016 Kazakhstan held its first Women's Entrepreneurship Day (WED) on Nov. 19. WED is a global women's entrepreneurship support initiative launched in 2014 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. Asian Development Bank implements a programme in Kazakhstan that supports small and medium-sized businesses. One-third of lending provided by the Bank was directed to women and 750 projects worth 51.9 billion tenge (US$155 million) were financed.

Kyrgyzstan country study (Glenn E. Curtis, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (March 1996). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Rural inhabitants continue the traditional Siberian tribal practice of bride kidnapping (abducting women and girls for forced marriage). Bride kidnapping, known as ala kachuu (to take and flee), girls as young as 12 years old are kidnapped for forced marriage, by being captured and carried away by groups of men or even relatives who, through violence or deception, take the girl to the abductor's family who forces and coerces the young woman to accept the illegal marriage. In most cases, the young woman is raped immediately in the name of marriage.[8] Although the practice is illegal in Kyrgyzstan, bride kidnappers are rarely prosecuted. This reluctance to enforce the code is in part caused by the corrupt legal system in Kyrgyzstan where many villages are de facto ruled by councils of elders and aqsaqal courts following customary law, away from the eyes of the state legal system.[9] Cultural background Kyrgyzstan is a country in Central Asia, with strong nomadic traditions. Most of Kyrgyzstan was annexed to Russia in 1876, but the Kyrgyz staged a major Marxism influenced violent conflict with the Tsarist Empire in 1916. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936, and became an independent state in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed. The current population of the country consists of a Kyrgyz majority (70.9%), followed by Uzbeks at 14.3%, and Russians at 7.7%. There are also other minorities such as Dungan, Uyghur, Tajik, Turk, Kazakh, Tatar, Ukrainian, Korean and German. Most of the population is Muslim (75%), but there is also a significant Russian Orthodox minority (20%). The country is largely rural: only 35.7% of the population lives in urban areas. The total fertility rate is 2.66 children born/woman (2015 estimate), despite the fact that the modern contraceptive prevalence rate is quite low, at 36.3% (2012 estimate). The literacy rate of women is very high at 99.4% (2015 estimate). Modern times In modern times, especially in the first years of independence, women have played more prominent roles in Kyrgyzstan than elsewhere in Central Asia. As a result of the December 16, 2007 parliamentary elections, 23 women representing three political parties have positions in parliament.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Kyrgyz Republic (2007). United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 18, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. As of 2007, women held several high‑level government posts, including minister of finance, minister of education and science, minister of labor and social development, chief justice of the Constitutional Court, the chair of the State Committee on Migration and Employment Issues, and chair of the CEC. As of 2007, no women occupied the positions of governor or head of local government. In August 2007, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev signed into effect an action plan on achieving gender balance for 2007–2010. Between 2007 and 2010, women members of parliament introduced 148 out of the 554 bills that were considered on the floor, covering issues from breastfeeding protection in health bill to the adoption of a law guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities for women and men.\\"Widening women's political representation in Kyrgyzstan\\", United Nations Development Programme, August 11, 2010. In March 2010, opposition politician Roza Otunbaeva rose to power as caretaker president following a revolution against Bakiyev's government, becoming Kyrgyzstan's first female president.\\"Otunbaeva Inaugurated as Kyrgyz President\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, March 7, 2010. Violence against women Despite laws against them, many crimes against women are not reported due to psychological pressure, cultural traditions, and apathy of law enforcement officials. Rape, including spousal rape, is illegal, but enforcement of the law is very poor. Rape is underreported, and prosecutors rarely bring rape cases to court. = Bride kidnapping, forced and early marriage = Although prohibited by law, rural inhabitants continue the traditional practice of bride kidnapping (abducting women and girls for forced marriage). In many primarily rural areas, bride kidnapping, known as ala kachuu (to take and flee), is an accepted and common way of taking a wife. Girls as young as 12 years old are kidnapped for forced marriage, by being captured and carried away by groups of men who, through violence or deception, take the girl to the home of the intended groom, where the abductor's family pressures and coerces the young woman to accept the marriage. In some cases, the young woman is raped in order to force the marriage. Although the practice is illegal in Kyrgyzstan, bride kidnappers are rarely prosecuted. This reluctance to enforce the code is in part caused by the pluralistic legal system in Kyrgyzstan where many villages are de facto ruled by councils of elders and aqsaqal courts following customary law, away from the eyes of the state legal system.See Judith Beyer, \\"Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts: Pluralistic Accounts of History\\", Journal of Legal Pluralism, 2006; Handrahan, pp. 212–213. The law against bride kidnapping was toughened in 2013. =Domestic violence= The Law on Social and Legal Protection against Domestic Violence (2003) is Kyrgyzstan's law against domestic violence. In practice, police often refuse to register domestic violence complaints, which are seen as private. =Sex trafficking= Citizen and foreign women and girls are victims of sex trafficking in Kyrgyzstan. They are raped and physically and physiologically harmed in brothels, hotels, homes, and other locations throughout the country. =Sexual harassment= Sexual harassment is prohibited by law; however, according to an expert at the local NGO Shans, it is rarely reported or prosecuted. = Violent extremism and terrorism = ISIS recruitment occurs on a small scale in Kyrgyzstan. From 2010-2016 the government reported that 863 citizens had participated as foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq, 188 of which were women. It has been suggested that women in Kyrgyzstan join due to either family pressure from the husband or sometimes other relatives, which has been referred to as \\"zombification,\\" or as a way to seek higher social status, financial prosperity, and sometimes the offer of marriage.  Women in law enforcement and security  The Association of Women Police of Kyrgyzstan was established in 2010 with the aim of supporting female police officers and to advocate for gender equality in law enforcement and within government more generally. In March 2017 the Association of Women in the Security Sector was established in Bishkek. Both entities are supported by the OSCE in Kyrgyzstan. Legal rights and gender equality Women enjoy the same rights as men, including under family law, property law, and in the judicial system, although discrimination against women persists in practice. The 2010 Constitution of Kyrgyzstan insures gender equality. Article 16 reads: (2) [...] \\"No one may be subject to discrimination on the basis of sex, race, language, disability, ethnicity, belief, age, political and other convictions, education, background, proprietary and other status as well as other circumstances.\\" (4)\\"In the Kyrgyz Republic men and women shall have equal rights and freedoms and equal opportunities for their realization.\\" The Soviet rulers claimed to have abolished many harmful traditions deriving from discriminatory nomadic practices and customs, such as bride price and forced marriage, although it is debatable to what extent this was true - according to some sources \\"Traditional marriage practices in the rural regions [...] have been little affected by Soviet domination\\", while the bride price, although outlawed by the communist regime, continued under the guise of \\"gifts\\". Today, in practice, women, especially in remote rural areas, are often discriminated and prevented from enjoying their legal rights, and are often unaware of their rights and \\"[t]hey do not know that they can report beatings by their husbands to the police.\\" = Polygamy = On March 26, parliament voted against a measure to decriminalize polygamy. Although no official statistics were available, Minister of Justice Marat Kaiypov stated that the ministry prosecutes two to three polygamy cases each year. = Prostitution = Prostitution is not a crime, although the operation of brothels, pimping, and recruiting persons into prostitution is illegal, with penalties of up to five years in prison. With no legal measures in place to regulate the industry, it was an ongoing problem. The NGO Tais-Plus continued to defend the rights of people in prostitution.

However, due to the large number of officially recognized religions in Lebanon, Lebanese family matters are governed by at least 15 personal statute codes. Lebanese women have legal protection that varies depending on their religion. In Muslim families, marriageable age can be as soon as the child reaches puberty and polygamy is allowed. Muslim women can legally marry Christian or Jewish men; for example a Lebanese Catholic man can marry a Muslim lady on the condition of getting their children baptised, otherwise, the couple may opt for civil marriage performed abroad, which can be registered at any Lebanese Embassy, thus giving it official recognition (this is a particularly popular option, with Cyprus usually acting as the destination of choice). Children born to a Lebanese woman and a man from another country will not have their children granted Lebanese nationality. Local and regional NGOs have helped to increase awareness of violence against women in Lebanon. Government policies regarding this are poor however, and attempts to improve this area have been met with resistance. Lebanon's laws do not recognize the concept of spousal rape, and attempt to add this to law have been attacked by Lebanese clerics. The family in Lebanon, as elsewhere in the Middle East region, assigns different roles to family members on the basis of gender. The superior status of men in society and within the narrow confines of the nuclear family transcends the barriers of sect or ethnicity. Lebanese family structure is patriarchal. The centrality of the father figure stems from the role of the family as an economic unit. This notion prevails in rural regions of Lebanon where women participate in peasant work. However, it is noticed that the percentage of women working in the labor force has increased. Since, 1970, Arab societies have allowed women to play a more active role socially and in the work force, basically as a result of the manpower shortage caused by heavy migration of men to Persian Gulf countries. Notwithstanding the persistence of traditional attitudes regarding the role of women, Lebanese women enjoy equal civil rights and attend institutions of higher education in large numbers (for example, women constituted 41 percent of the student body at the American University of Beirut in 1983). Although women in Lebanon have their own organizations, most exist as subordinate branches of the political parties. Political representation of women in Lebanon = Women's suffrage = France confirmed the electoral system of the former Ottoman Mount Lebanon province in setting up a Representative Council for Greater Lebanon in 1922. Two stage elections, universal adult male suffrage, and multimember multi-communal constituencies continued the situation that prevailed in Mount Lebanon up to 1914.Harris, William. Lebanon: a history, 600-2011. Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 160. Women in Lebanon gained suffrage in 1952, only five years after men did in the new Republic (in the year 1947). The Lebanese constitution — specifically Article 7, proclaimed that \\"All Lebanese are equal under the law, enjoying equally civil and political rights, and performing duties and public responsibility without any discrimination among them.\\" This however did not protect against gender discrimination and thus women were not equally protected. Women were refused the right to vote by early Lebanese government until they organized and began petitioning for equal rights. In 1952 the Women's Political Rights Agreement came about and guaranteed that women would be able to vote. Women gained the right to vote but with a limitation, they had to have an elementary education. Women had to have documents that could prove that they had received at least an elementary level education. This limitation was lifted five years later in 1957 without much discourse or a fight.Elections in Asia and the Pacific: A Data Handbook : Volume I: Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia. Oxford University Press. 2001. p. 174 = Women in politics = Women gained the right to vote halfway into the 20th century, thirty years after American women suffragists gained the right in the United States. Though the women of Lebanon garnered their right to vote fairly early on, there is still a huge lack of them in Lebanon's political sphere. The political field in Lebanon, like most of the rest of the world, is male dominated. That is not to say there are no women actors in Lebanon, they are just few and far between. As of 2009 there had only been seventeen women to serve on parliament since suffrage. That number is rather dismal but paints the perfect picture of what the outlook of women in parliament is. The lack of women in politics is chalked up the political exclusivity that is bred in Lebanon, constricting societal norms and gender roles. The political arena in the country is mostly made of a small number of elite families that have been in power since the 1950s and 1960s and the beginning of suffrage. There is an extreme lack of women in elected and appointed political positions. To combat the low rate of women's participation in politics and government, the Lebanese Women's Council (LWC) planned a conference in 1998. Along with other women's NGOs, the LWC proposed a quota system to the government to ensure women's equal representation in elections. NGOs or non-governmental organizations have been created in response to the lack of women's political representation. The government did not take heed to any of their suggestions. According to Dr. Zeina Zaatari “Many women's NGOs have prioritized their missions toward the economic and social needs of women in rural areas and women with little access to resources. These organizations work toward achieving women's rights on the ground. A large number of women's organizations also focus on lobbying and aim to research and publish their findings on women to influence policy makers and the judicial system. The Lebanese Women's Council (LWC), established in the 1950s, serves as an umbrella entity for more than 140 organization = Political representation = One of the very important characteristics of Lebanese politics is the excess of political parties competing for power and control. There are eighteen political parties in total in the country, but seven currently dominate the sphere. These political parties are almost all men dominated, and the women that do head these parties are often only there because they are a part of one of the political families and have been put in place for power often because of a sudden death or lack of men left to run in the family. Men control the leadership of the country, often silencing the women’s voices. The Lebanese constitution is a French system, which promotes equality between “all” citizens. However, in Lebanon the governmental power of the country is separated by the religious factions based on the size of each of their populations. These figures are extremely outdated and are based on a census of the country that was taken in the year 1943.Khalife, Nadya. \\"A Woman's Place, in Lebanon Human Rights Watch.\\" A Woman's Place, in Lebanon Human Rights Watch. N.p., 2 July 2009. Web. 21 Nov. 2014 Lebanon formally identifies that there are eighteen religious acknowledgements of Muslim and Christian denominations in the country. The major political parties thus include Hezbollah and Amal (Shi'a); Future Movement, led by MP Saad Hariri, the younger son of the assassinated former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafic Hariri (Sunni); Phalange Party and the Lebanese Forces (Maronite Christians); Progressive Socialist Party (Druze); and the Free Patriotic Movement which in theory has members from all confessions, but remains predominantly Christian. These religious based parties often discriminate against women and refuse to include them. As of 2009 according to Don Duncan of Le Monde Diplomatique (English edition), “With only 3.1% of seats now occupied by women, Lebanon is at the bottom of the table of parliamentary representation of women in the Middle East, down with conservative Gulf states like: Oman (none), Yemen (0.3%) and Bahrain (2.7%) (2). whereas neighboring Syria has 12.4%, Tunisia has 22.8% and Iraq has a 25% quota for women\\".\\"Lebanon's Women Lose Political Ground.\\" - Le Monde Diplomatique. N.p. Gender roles =Marriage/parental= Women's rights has become fairly progressive over the centuries in Lebanon compared to other Middle Eastern countries as Islamic Law (Sharia Law) is not used to implement laws (however different sects may uphold some traditions within their community). For example, Article 7 of the constitution of Lebanon asserts that all citizens should have equal rights and duties regardless of gender. They also have Article 8 of the constitution of Lebanon that individual liberty will be guaranteed and protected by law; however Lebanese women still face gender discrimination. Though some laws are put into place in respect to women and their rights, officials are not frequent with enforcing specifically, gender equality. Not to mention there are still some discrimination laws and penal codes that have been put into place and these laws remain because Lebanon is based upon patriarchal social norms and majority of the men in Lebanon acquire the high positioned jobs within society. Because patriarchal social norms are enforced, women find the laws set to protect their women rights as ineffective and more restrictive than men in Lebanon, granted urban Lebanese women have more opportunities than rural Lebanese movement but both women alike still face restrictions on their actions. Though Lebanese women have the right to attend school, get a job in society, etc. the expected norm is for them to still be subordinate, submissive, and make time for the home. Some discriminatory acts that women face as Lebanese women that heavily restrict their movement are rules on divorce and parental custody. Because it is still common in Lebanese culture (where many are Muslim) that woman shall submit to their husband, many salient rights are given to the husband/father first before the mother. Raising children Parenting was an important political act for some Lebanese in the aftermath of the First World War. This resulted in the reflection of critical transformations in French-Lebanese relations but also contributed significantly to the process of the state formation. Literature situating children in any historical context in Lebanon is also liable to frame childhood in highly static terms and to underestimate its significance in a matrix of other social, cultural, political, and economic forces. Those identified as such were variously understood as infants, children, youth, adolescents, boys, or girls, mostly on account of the social and gender roles they played, rather than any other set of factors, but also sometimes by age, biology, and even class. One of the most conflicted domains, however, in which definitions of the child were called into question was the law. Also, for Islamic jurists, the age at which a woman received her first menses was important for several reasons. Not only did it signal her entry into adulthood biologically, but it also meant that her responsibilities as a Muslim increased significantly. Procedures for children According to one treatise on the five schools of Islamic law, \\"There is consensus among the schools that menses and pregnancy are the proofs of female adulthood. “The strictures of acceptable behavior pertaining to a woman's menstrual cycle were not simple, and her ability to comply with them, especially to follow the proper schedule for ritual washing, meant that she could handle \\"adult\\" tasks. It was at this point, too, that she would typically begin to fast for the entire length of the day during the holy month of Ramadan, like an adult. However, \\"all the schools concur that any discharge that occurs before a girl reaches the age of nine years cannot possibly be menstrual; it is due to disease or injury.\\" So, while nine was a technical minimum of legal adulthood for females, menstruation that early was unexpected. Fourteen or fifteen, for boys and girls, was a much more likely age at which to expect the onset of puberty. Draft law for descendants of Lebanese Under the current Lebanese nationality law, descendants of Lebanese emigrants can only receive citizenship from their father and women cannot pass on citizenship to their spouse or children. On 7 November 2015, Gebran Bassil, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants, \\"refused to compromise on a draft law that would grant citizenship to the descendants of Lebanese expatriates by expanding it to include the foreign spouses and children of Lebanese women\\". =Education= Education was on the colonial agenda from beginning to end and was awarded special attention on account of its perceived ability to effect the greatest change in the greatest number of Lebanese. It was also something that missionaries and colonial administrators believed they could collaborate on together, as they imagined a similar citizen-figure into which Lebanese children were to be crafted by the West. Young people were marked out by foreign missionaries for their potential to transform not just the next generation of Lebanese but also the present generation of parents, especially mothers. =Marriage: women vs. men= Women and men are looked at differently based on their gender in Lebanon and the stipulations and norms are different for both. The penal code in Lebanon specifically in marriage used to be in favour of the man. However, it has witnessed some much needed reform. Article 562, which had historically been used to reduce sentences awarded for a non- premeditated honour killing resulting from an \\"illegitimate\\" sexual intercourse, was scrapped by the Lebanese Parliament on August 4, 2011. Moreover, in 2014, the Lebanese Parliament finally passed a full-fledged law targeting domestic violence. Nevertheless, some existing laws still tend to favour men in some aspects. For example, if the male spouse is an adulterer before accused his adulterous act is questioned on whether it was done in the marital home or the adulterous relationship become public; however, the woman if accused of adulterous acts anywhere anytime no matter the circumstance is automatically convicted. Moreover, if convicted the sentencing time is less for a male than female ( male: one month to one year; female: three months to three years). Recently, there have been talks about decriminalising adultery altogether, and a draft law submitted by MP Samy Gemayel on the matter is still pending review. Single mothers in Lebanon Mothers were described to be very alone in the process once they embarked on motherhood. The average thought of a Lebanese woman, after she finds the news that she is carrying a child is, “My life stopped and my world was crushed when I found out that I was pregnant. … The whole world was against me. No partner by my side to support me, no family to acknowledge me after I had brought shame to our family’s name, as they say”. A woman by the name of Samar, made it very clear just how misunderstood she was and felt when it came to motherhood. A young man that she considered her friend, lured her into trusting him and then he raped her and left the country for work. He would not return any of the calls she made to reach out to him. This first reach in this situation in Lebanon is for the parents to make the young man marry their daughter. The second attempt was to convince the women to have an abortion. =Common struggles for Lebanese women= There are so many stories regarding single mothers in Lebanon, but they all have one thing in common: None of them really chose this path, unlike women in more liberal countries, where single motherhood is now a choice and a path women can take without being rejected by society. However, things are different in Lebanon. Every single mother has already lived a horrible tragedy before getting to the birth phase and raising her child alone. Stories of rape, sexual assault, incest, partners leaving and many other tragedies mean that single mothers are rejected socially and economically for something that is often not even their fault. There were single mother issues in Lebanon, which was also viewed as taboo. It was so bad that society's organizations would at all cost disregard providing any form of assistance in the area to avoid being seen as helpers of women who became pregnant without being married. There are few organizations for single mothers to turn to, and centers supported by official bodies to help them organize their affairs have yet to be established. The Maryam and Martha Organization, one of the few associations helping these women, has been receiving single mothers for many years, providing them with the support they need. =Hospital practices in maternity wards in Lebanon= Eight out of thirty-nine hospitals in Lebanon had well established prenatal care classes, however only three actually enrolled all women in these classes. There were other forms of providing, such as information at a low, only having four hospitals giving written information regarding care during the labor as well as delivery. Six healthcare providers reported that inquiring women about their preferences. Furthermore, few gave women any opportunity for procedures such as shaving, enema or fetal monitoring application. Lastly, it was seen that all places had strict mobility for women in the delivery process, including eight who tied their arms and legs. Economy:Women =History= The Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli Invasion of Lebanon have affected Lebanon's economy tremendously. Since 2008 their economy has grown about 8 percent but not significantly enough as they are still a country highly in debt from war. Women in correlation with the economy have been able to participate since the 1970s but they are still underrepresented in the labor force and are the first to be negatively impacted when the economy fails. Currently in Lebanon, Article 215 of their Law of Contracts and Obligations allow men and women the same right to own and administer property. Married women can even own and manage their property separately regardless of their religious affiliation. Although given the same rights there are still inequitable repercussions that negatively affect the women more than men. For example, if a woman's husband declare bankruptcy then there are restrictions that are put on the women's property but not the man's. Furthermore, there is some legal wording that makes it harder for women to stand completely independently economically because women's property, if married are considered purchases by the man's money and technically considered an asset of the man's unless proven otherwise. Here you see women though given equal opportunity to acquire property, still not completely equal to man as there is legal wording that gives women a harder time to be seen as an individual human being instead of a subordinate or an asset/accessory to her husband. =Work force= Women have the right to work in Lebanon. Though given the right more men are still seen in the work force than women (see figure 4 below by the Institute of Women's Policy research). More women especially those between the age 36 to 55 tend to stay in the home and tend to their family and raising children, playing into the social norms of women's role in Lebanon's patriarchal society. Although men are relatively represented more in the work force, women still work. Women are more likely to take on part-time jobs if they do work as they have to tend to their household duties as well. Article 29 of Lebanon's Employment Act was amended to increase maternity leave; however, Lebanon does meet the standard given by the ILO convention 103 granting women no less than 12 weeks. Not to mention Lebanon does not offer services to help with childcare making it hard for women to indulge themselves completely in the work force and paternity leave is not offered at all. Common jobs for women who do work are generally in the service area or do specialists work ( see figure 6 below by Institute of Women's Policy research to see other jobs women take part in) . Women's salaries compared to their male counterpart is drastically different. Men tend to make more than women causing a vast gender wage gap. Three times as many men as women make more than 1101 dollars per month while three times as many women as men earn less than 300 dollars a month. Although, women and men who work in the government/public sector make similar wages, women in the private sector do not and 86 percent of most workers in Lebanon work in the private sector and 80 percent of the women in the private sector make 700 or below (see figure 9 and 10 by Institute of Women's Policy research for wage gap). There is also a big gap between pay based on a woman's age. The younger the woman the more likely she is to be paid less ( 2 out of every 3 young women earn 500 dollars or less) as increase in pay comes with years of experience. Women's movements in Lebanon: women's rights and violence against women =Women in the Government= In order to understand the true importance of the women's movement in Lebanon, it is important to first understand the government and social norms prevalent within the Middle East. The government of Lebanon operates on a parliamentary scale which includes representatives of each recognized religious organizations in addition to one prime minister which determines the laws that regulate the country. This Parliament is composed entirely of people who openly practice patriarchal religion. Lebanese women won the right to vote in 1952. However, since that victory, only seventeen women have served in the Lebanese parliament. Not only do each of these religions have their own place in Parliament, they also have their own courts and codes of conduct. While Lebanon is often seen as a very liberal country, arguably the most liberal country within the Middle East, the systematic oppression of women is still prevalent. Currently, women are able to: marry freely while understanding that divorce may bring about a great deal of socioeconomic hardships, vote as long as they are able to prove that they have obtained an elementary education, have jobs as long as those jobs do not encroach on their domestic obligations, and walk around in public without having to wear hijabs. Unfortunately, even with all of those superficial rights, women are still subjected to unwanted advances and social discrimination. Constitutionally, Lebanese women and men are regarded as equals; however, they are not free from laws and publicly accepted socialized behaviors which encourage male intervention of those rights in the name of honor or family preservation. =Women in Lebanon= Lebanon is guided by 15 or more religious codes and courts including Shi'a, Sunni, Maronite Christians, and Druze parties, all of which \\"compete to preserve narrow sectarian interests, not those of a unified Lebanon\\". Coincidentally, these all encourage the oppression of women. Founded in 1973, the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World was created by the Lebanese American University. While the IWSAW aims to educate Middle Eastern women, they have also been at the forefront of many women's movements. They contribute greatly to women's movements by virtue of their research and publications. One such project, Who is She, was designed after IWSAW conducted research to determine how many contemporary Lebanese women in professional positions are widely known to the public. This is a database that provides the public with \\"easy access to bibliographical information on a large number of contemporary women in one of the following categories: opinion leaders, senior managers, politicians, professionals, artists, researchers, and experts within a wide range of subjects\\". Women who are engaged in political organizations often acquire social stigma. For example, many women within the Palestinian resistance movement live in Lebanese camps. These women \\"have political meetings at night and often sleep away from home. Many have been called prostitutes for doing so. But they have stood fast saying that their country comes before family\\". Most of these women are educated and trained to fight, yet are still subject to discrimination and sexualization in post war Lebanon. In most Middle Eastern countries, Lebanese women are regarded as symbols of the nation, not necessarily as active members. As most contemporary Lebanese women are not known for their contributions outside of the world of scholars, many women's movements go undocumented and are brushed under the rug by the patriarchal government. =Legal contributions of women= Between 2006 and 2008, many Lebanese people protested in opposition of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora. Since the Prime Minister and parliament are the individuals approving laws, such protests were important especially for women. At the forefront of these protests were major women's organizations (NGOs). One feminist NGO which tackled exploitation and violence on women was Kafa. Kafa, which was founded in 2005, along with many other women's organizations, aims to diminish social, legal, and economic forms of patriarchy in order to stop violence against women and children. They proposed a law, which was drafted in 2009, that was to stop domestic violence against women, including marital rape. This NGO group wrote letters to the Cabinet of Ministers which later stated that they would vie for legal reform and protect women against family violence. After much lobbying and protesting, people within these NGOs succeeded in pushing the draft law to the parliament where it sat in arrest. Over time, while it was stuck at Parliament, this law was amended continuously due to objections of religious conservatives. The biggest disagreement regarding this law was one of the most prevalent issues for women: marital rape. Suggestions to amend the law included removal of the segment outlining marital rape as a crime. Although passing that law may lead to the decrease of many violent situations within the household, its proposed amendment will defeat the purpose of the law. Some women's activists would argue that the myriad of amendments within this law makes the law detrimental to the advancement of women in Lebanon. Because there are so many differences within each of the religious courts, domestic violence is handled in a different way depending on which region a woman is involved with. It is frowned upon for a woman to ever initiate a divorce, in mostly all of the religious sectors of the parliament. In some courts, a woman asking for a divorce must obtain a substantial amount of evidence regarding her husband's indiscretion. Likewise, if a man were seeking a divorce, in many courts he could obtain that divorce with very little evidence, and in the name of honor or family preservation. For example, if a woman who was a victim of spousal rape were to attempt to get a divorce from her husband, that effort would be dismissed in many courts by the socially accepted idea, which is supported by Judge Sheik Ahmad Al- Kurdi of the Sunni religious court, that such indictment “could lead to the imprisonment of the man, where in reality he is exercising the least of his marital rights.”. This implies that the man, by virtue of being her husband, is therefore in full compliance with the laws and codes of conduct of Lebanon. In addition, a woman who goes to her family for support in filing for a divorce may be met with both opposition to her decision, and shame surrounding it. Such socially accepted beliefs actively contribute to the marginalization of women's voices in Lebanon. In December 2016, the Campaign Against Lebanese Rape Law - Article 522 was launched to abolish the article in the penal code that allowed a man to escape prison if he married his victim.

Although the majority of Maldivian today women wear the veil, this is a phenomenon experienced in the past two decades or so, possibly as a response to increased religious conservatism, they are not strictly secluded, but special sections are reserved for women in public places in some events. However, those women who refuse to wear a veil or decide to remove it face social stigma from both their families and members of the public. Women do not accept their husbands' names after marriage but maintain their maiden names. Inheritance of property is through both males and females. With one of the highest divorce rates in the world, women in general has enjoyed marriage and divorce rights throughout history. Both divorced men and women face no stigma, and historically women also has the right to initiate divorce. Catcalling and sexual harassment is a major problem in Maldives for Maldivian and foreign women alike. Women find that it is a daily part of their lives to be harassed on the streets. A total of 96% of women in the Maldives reported having been harassed on the streets at some point in their lives, with 60% facing harassment before turning 16 and 40% reporting being sexually harassed before they turned 10. Men of all ages find catcalling perfectly acceptable in especially Male' city. Little to no action is taken against people who harass women on the road and the number of sexual assaults and rapes is on the increase. In today's society some women hold positions in government and business but they are heavily under- represented. As of 2016 women only accounted for three out of 14 government ministers, five out of 85 lawmakers and six out of more than 180 judges. However the vast majority of Civil Servants are Female employees. The male female ratio of enrolment and completion of education to secondary school standards remains equivalent, with Female students academically exceeding the results of Male students in recent years. But on average they earn less than half the salaries of men in the workplace, possibly as a consequence of a higher Male education levels a few decades ago. However, with the increased number of Females who pursue higher education, which is set to overtake Males this is likely to change in the near future. This change is also seen positively in the birth rate, which currently sees the Maldives on a negative birth rate, due to prolonged educational periods and change in social norms. Polygamy in the Maldives is legal, but very rare. Prostitution in the Maldives is illegal. Homosexuality is illegal. In 2013, a 15-year-old rape victim received a sentence of 100 lashes for fornication. The sentence was later overturned by the Maldivian High Court, following an international petition campaign led by Avaaz. A disproportionate number of women face public flogging for extra-marital sex compared to men: the majority of men accused of extra- marital sex are acquitted. (Maldivian law only enforces punishment to these actions only through admission. Even though the Maldives is a 100 percent Muslim country for nearly a thousand years, there is no record of stoning, or execution for murder unlike most other Islamic or Non-Islamic nations across the world.)

Traditional status of Mongolian women  Mongolian women have historically enjoyed a somewhat higher status than women from other East Asian cultures. Women in Mongolia played vital roles in the family and economic life. Some more elite women had more opportunities than poor women, yet the demanding lifestyle required all women to work. Each household member had responsibilities, yet those of women tended to be much greater loads. In many cultures, women were expected to run the domestic duties in a household, yet women in Mongolia also managed out of the home work such as taking care of animals, manufacturing dairy products, shearing wool, and tanning hides. Through their household work, women in elite ranks of society were able to further their roles in order to gain substantial amounts of power. Those less fortunate were unable to benefit from their domestic work. When the Mongol empire collapsed, poor women in society were unable to get any sort of proper health care or any opportunity for education and leisure. Nomadic women in Mongolia have typically been those responsible for collecting buckets of water, cooking meals for the family, keeping livestock healthy, collecting wood for fires, nursing and raising children, making clothing, and generally keeping all domestic affairs in order. History has proved that the perception of Mongolian women today has revealed many contradictions. Many cultures that surround the Mongolian women are seen as subordinate to men; yet for Mongolian women today, they are dominated by noble womanhood. It is said that Mongolian women have traditionally had a higher degree of social positions and autonomy than women in the Islamic societies of Asia, China and Korea. For those women who were widowed or left because of husbands in the military, taking over their jobs was often a common compromise. Although this did take place in many Mongol societies, women were still considered subordinate to men. Women were also domestically restricted in what they were and were not allowed to take part in when their husbands were around. Firm actions of this subordination were taken place in daily activities such as women were only allowed to tend to sheep, yet men were responsible for horses- a lamb versus a stallion in generic historical terms.  Mongolian People's Republic  Mongolian People's Republic is the period of Mongolian history which existed between 1924 and 1992 as a unitary sovereign socialist state in East Asia. It was ruled by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and maintained close links with the Soviet Union throughout its history. During this period, women in Mongolia obtained de jure equal rights. They had universal participation in all levels of education. In 1985, 63% of students in higher educational establishments were women along with 58% of the students in secondary schools. During the time frame, there were 51% women workers and 49% male. Educated women began teaching and taking charge in the medicine department in 1979. These were both generally thought as the more female fields, and more than 60% of all doctors were female. Teaching was also predominantly a woman’s job with 67% of all teachers in general schools and 33% of teachers in higher educational schools. Despite having formal legal equality, as in other socialist states, de facto women remained subordinated to men.  Marriage  Mongolian woman with her child Weddings in Mongolia are one of the most influential days of a man and woman's life together. Weddings are celebrated events that at times are even more important than births or deaths. In the past, history explains that Mongolian women were often married as young women of ages about 13 to 14. Boys were often married a bit older than women. In modern day, those with less money normally marry in their earlier 20s, while those more urban marry later in their 20s and 30s. Mongolians normally had arranged marriages and once a man is married he is not allowed to marry thereafter. Monogamy is practiced. Dating is not as common for those with less money such as herders, yet sex prior to marriage is practiced. When a woman gets married, normally she is expected to go and live with the grooms family. However, today nuclear families are becoming more common. When a woman's husband passes away, it was not uncommon for her to marry her husband's brother. This is an old Mongolian tradition that is rarely practiced today. Marriage for Mongolians is normally a contract; an arrangement to meet the requirements of both families rather than religious events. Many marriages in Mongolia are between friends or coworkers, that way women were married into their own social status.  Reproduction rights  Terms changed in 1921 when women were considered more of a value into economic growth for the population. A revolution began that year with determinations to bring women more into the public sphere. This was the first step in the states effort to promote population growth; a strong emphasis on women’s reproductive capacities. Women were pressured into having multiple children as part of their civic duties to the state.  Politics  = History of Women's Political Affiliation = The political alignment in Mongolia for women is the belief that women are discriminated against because they are women. Women also believe that they have little legitimacy when discussing political affairs with men. In the most traditional sense, in nomadic society, women were not allowed to partake in the formal political sphere as their decisions were limited to the household. The subordination from a man to a woman in Mongolia came to an end in 1921. This granted women citizen rights. The new constitution also gave equal rights to all citizens of Mongolia without focus of origin, sex, gender, or beliefs. In 1924, Mongolian women were able to vote and potentially be elected as President. The Women's Federation was also founded which was funded by the state itself allowing more women to become more active participants in the political system. Although many actions were taken, there is still much to be said for women in the political system and desire for the equality they would eventually like to have and deserve. Sex trafficking Mongolian women and girls have been victims of sex trafficking in Mongolia. They have been raped and physically and psychologically harmed in brothels, homes, businesses, and other locations throughout the country, notably at the China–Mongolia border.

In the early 1990s, like in some other Asian countries, women in Nepal were generally subordinate to men in virtually every aspect of life. Historically, Nepal has predominantly been a patriarchal society where women are generally subordinate to men. Men were considered to be the leader of the family and superior than women. Also, social norms and values were biased in favor of men. This strong bias in favor of sons in society meant that daughters were discriminated against from birth and did not have equal opportunities to achieve all aspects of development.Bhattarai, Arjun Kumar. “How rural women experience disempowered in Nepal : an empirical study on women experience as the main obstacles to their disempowerment in their everyday lives”. Universitetet i Nordland, 2014. Daughters were deprived of many privileges, including rights, education, healthcare, parental property rights, social status, last rites of dead parents, and were thought to be other's property and liabilities. In the past century, there has been a dramatic positive change in the role and status of women in Nepal, thinning the barrier to gender inequality. While the 1990 Constitution guaranteed fundamental rights to all citizens without discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, caste, religion, or sex, modernizing society along with reach of education to the general population itself has played an important role to promote gender equality. The roles of women have changed in various ways in the modern Nepalese society. Despite the difficult post-conflict transitional context, today, Nepal is not only rapidly progressing towards economic development, it is also achieving targets for poverty and hunger, universal primary education, child mortality, maternal health and gender equality and women's empowerment. Women's representation in the Constituent Assembly has dramatically increased to 29% in the November 2013 elections from 2.9% in 1991 (in the then parliament). Women are now taking leadership roles and participating in decision making at all levels. There has been increased government involvement to increase accountability and monitoring of gender equality commitments and to establish and strengthen linkages between the normative and operational aspects of gender equality and women's empowerment. Today, Nepalese women are defying cultural traditions, and are becoming community leaders, environmentalists politicians and business owners.

Unequal citizens : gender, caste and ethnic exclusion in Nepal : Summary (English). Washington, DC: World Bank. http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/201971468061735968/Summary Given that fact that Nepalese society is heavily derived from the Hindu system of beliefs emphasizing patrilineal descent and a patrifocal residence system, in several cases people restrain themselves from implementing certain aspects of these laws and don't accept equal role, status and right for women. The rugged, mountainous topography adds to this issue. In these remote places, gender disparity still exists, women's have limited control or saying, women are restricted to household works, deprived of education, discriminated based on caste, and have poor healthcare access. Existing laws are inadequate to deal with sexual offenses and Nepal has no law to deal with sexual harassment. This is also the reason why, Nepalese women are frequently subjected to a regime of rape and domestic abuse, and young women risk being trafficked to the brothels of India. Also, there are many superstitions and taboos related to caste and mensuration leading to discrimination of women. In these cases, they are not allowed to touch drinking water, have to live away from the house secluded while menstruating,cannot perform/attend religious activities. History Nepali woman in traditional dress, 1900s Nepal being a predominantly agricultural society, the senior female member played a commanding role within the family by controlling resources, making crucial planting and harvesting decisions, and determining the expenses and budget allocations. Yet women's lives remained centered on their traditional roles —taking care of most household chores, fetching water and animal fodder, and doing farm work. Their standing in society was mostly contingent on their husbands' and parents' social and economic positions. They had limited access to markets, productive services, education, health care, and local government. Malnutrition and poverty hit women hardest. Women usually worked harder and longer than men. By contrast, women from high-class families had maids to take care of most household chores and other menial work and thus worked far less than men or women in lower socioeconomic groups. Economic prosperity aside, decision making was left to the men in the family. The economic contribution of women was substantial, but largely unnoticed because their traditional role was taken for granted. When employed, their wages normally were 25 percent less than those paid to men. In most rural areas, their employment outside the household generally was limited to planting, weeding, and harvesting. In urban areas, those migrating from rural areas or with a lower economic status were employed in domestic and traditional jobs, as well as in the government sector, mostly in low-level positions. One tangible measure of women's status was their educational attainment. Although the constitution offers women equal educational opportunities, many social, economic, and cultural factors contributed to lower enrollment and higher dropout rates for girls. Illiteracy imposed the greatest hindrance to enhancing equal opportunity and status for women. They were caught in a vicious circle imposed by the patriarchical society. Their lower status hindered their education, and the lack of education, in turn, constricted their status and position. Although the female literacy rate has improved noticeably over the years, the level in the early 1990s fell far short of the male level. The level of educational attainment among female children of wealthy and educated families was much higher than that among female children of poor families. This class disparity in educational attainment was also true for boys. In Nepal, as in many societies, education was heavily class-biased. In the early 1990s, a direct correlation existed between the level of education and status. Educated women had access to relatively high-status positions in the government and private service sectors, and they had a much higher status than uneducated women. This general rule was more applicable at the societal level than at the household level. Within the family, an educated woman did not necessarily hold a higher status than her uneducated counterpart. Also within the family, a woman's status, especially a daughter-in-law's status, was more closely tied to her husband's authority and to her parental family's wealth and status than anything else.  Law  The Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal of 1990 contained a guarantee that no person should be discriminated against on the basis of sex, and, in 1991, the government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). A 1975 amendment to the civil code introduced the first clear provision on property rights for women. It ruled that a woman who remained unmarried up to 35 years of age had a right to inherit property. In 2002, a bill was passed granting women the right to inherit property from birth, specifying however that at the time of marriage any property must be returned to the parent's family, with the wife obtaining equal right to her husband's property instead. The 2002 bill included also other provisions on women's rights, in particular granting a woman the right to divorce under certain conditions, a legalization of abortion, and increased punishments for rapists.Women's Property Right Movement and Achievement of the 11th Amendment of Civil Code, Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES) Nepal Office The Interim Constitution 2063 of Nepal has some provisions to uplift the status of women. The constitution says that a daughter can get equal parental property as son if she asks, a woman can divorce her husband and get 50% of his property, a child can acquire citizenship in the name of his/her mother, in every governmental office a 20% quota for female must be preserved, and 33% of seats are preserved in parliament for women. These efforts are done so that women can be in the mainstream politics of the country and be socially and economically strong. Nepal outlawed marital rape in 2006. The recent efforts made by the government and women have given women a stronger approach to many aspects. Now women are engaged in politics, business and in other fields. Recent surveys done by Nepal government have revealed a steady and large improvement in the field of women's rights in Nepal.  Gender roles  In Nepal, the historical gender roles, spaces and stereotypes of the ‘public’ male breadwinner (provider) and ‘private’ female care-giver are espoused even under changing situations. This is due to the association of household status with women's non-work that has been perpetuated by the circumstances of women having to offer their labor in the paid market work-spheres under extreme economic stress and poverty.Preeti Rustagi, 2016. \\"Situation of Women in South Asia: Some Dimensions,\\" Working Papers id:10949, eSocialSciences. Men are predominantly the ones who interact with the outside world while women's major sphere of operation is within the households. It is said that Nepali girls and women work for more than boys and men, spending 25 percent to 50 percent more time on households tasks, economic and agricultural activities.Yet, due to the nature of their work which is intertwined with household activities at times and is often unpaid, on the one hand, and the flawed definition of economic activity, on the other hand, women's economic participation remains statistically invisible. The role played by women in the care sector, predominantly their reproductive work, bearing, rearing, nurturing children and household maintenance are activities that fall outside the national accounting systems. While these activities are crucial for household members well-being and effective participation in different spheres – economic, social and political, they continue to remain non-economic activities. By virtue of women performing these roles which are statistically not counted as economic and hence not monetarily valued, women's roles and their contribution is assigned low status. In the Nepali context, the empowerment and development of women is inextricably bound to the dominant Hindu social structure, which influences all aspects of social, cultural, and economic life. This structure assigns women restricted roles, which most often involve household and family responsibilities. Nepali women have internalized this system and this makes it difficult for them to envision themselves in roles outside the home. Women also harm each other by passively accepting societal attitudes. In Nepal, women's words are thought to be only half true and are not treated seriously. Surprisingly, both men and women accept this societal attitude. Women cannot expect men to take them and their demands seriously if they themselves do not take each other seriously. Women's passive acceptance of their limited social status has resulted in the perpetuation of gender discrimination. Many women believe that this is the way it has always been and that this is the way it will always be. In the home, Nepali women are thought to be a source of life, but they are also compelled to slave away for male family members. Women are treated like seasonal workers and are sent away when they are no longer needed, often because they have failed to produce sons. Yet biology tell us gender is determined by the father's sperm. Social attitudes will not change as long as women believe them to be true and as long as parents choose to raise their children in homes in which gender discrimination is the norm. In some ethnic groups and social classes, women's roles in the economy goes beyond the domestic sphere as when Thakali women are Involved In the hotel and catering business, or when educated Gurung women have positions in the private and public sectors or when women from laboring households and from the so- called occupational castes work as field laborers or porters for others. It has been noted that women in the more orthodox Hindu communities who are largely confined to domestic and subsistence production display a much less significant role in major household economy decision than those in the Tibeto- Bunnan communities where women participate actively in the market economy. Some of the daughters and sisters of the rich family have jobs such as school teachers, social workers and the like. Both boys and girls from the well-off families get chance to go to school. On the contrary, very few cases of school enrollment are found among the poor families. Because of reading and writing skills of the well-off families, the local level government and semi- government jobs fall in their hands. In the poor households, ploughing, roofing, climbing the trees to lop the fodder, threshing rice, sowing, making bamboo baskets and bamboo mattress, manufacturing agricultural implements, etc. are the major tasks of the males whereas transplanting millet and paddy, grinding maize and millet, husking and winnowing of crops, cooking rice and washing utensils are the female's works. Digging, wedding, harvesting and carrying load are common for both sexes. Mothers usually nurse the infants. Mothers have major role for infants' caring which is also supported by grandmother, sister or elder children.Pokharel, Binod. Gender Roles and Activities Among the Rural Poor Households: Case Studies from Hill Villages, 2011. Dowry In Nepal, the custom of dowry is still common, and dowry- related violence remains a problem, even though the dowry system has been banned in Nepal. Despite the laws, incidents of domestic violence related to dowry continue, under a general perception of impunity. The practice of dowry is closely related to social prestige; and dowry violence is especially prevalent in the Terai belt. In 2009, Nepal enacted the Social Customs and Practices Act outlawing dowry; however, there have been no known cases of enforcement. In some communities, like the Newar people, the dowry system was meant as a gift that would assist the bride, in case she faced problems in the future. The dowry would be her wealth, that she was free to sell or use if she needed to start a nuclear family. So, the utensils and the money she received as dowry was to be kept separately under her own care until the time of need arrived. But with the growing influence of the other communities, under the caste system which is akin to the one followed in India Caste system in India, the system has started changing. And over the times, it has become a system that actually puts more pressure on the family of the bride to fulfill the expectations of the family of the groom. This in turn weakens the status of the woman in the family, instead of the original idea of strengthening it by providing her material support. Child marriage Child marriage is common in Nepal. The practice of marrying young girls is often driven by poverty, but its prevalence varies across the country, depending on level of education, wealth, geographic location, religion, and ethnicity. These marriages lead to pregnancy and birth at young ages, which often result in health problems, such as uterine prolapse. Aside from the issues that arise from the marriage itself, child widows are prevalent as well. These widows are seen as witches and bad luck. They are forced to repent for their sins and wear white for the rest of their lives. Remarrying, general pleasure in life, specific foods, family events, looking men in the eye, and even leaving home are off limits to widows. This is specifically seen as an issue for child widows because they essentially give up their lives. Although, child marriage is a part of Hindu culture, and many people see no issue with the practice. Many of the child widows in Nepal suffer abuse and trauma during and after their marriages. The age differences between bride and groom are usually large. Over 700 million women and girls in the world were married before the age of 18. The disparity between men and women is evident, with only 156 boys married between ages 15–18 compared with 720 million girls. Nepal makes the list of the top 10 countries with the highest rates of child marriage.  Domestic violence  Nepalese cultural, social, and religious patterns repeatedly enforce the low social status of women, often leading to a destructive lifestyle between genders. This violent culture is most prevalent in the marital aspect of their society. Instead of being treated as equal members in the human race, Nepalese women are shamed as less than mere slaves to their husbands. They must never refuse their partner's requests, and in the case that they do disagree, the women are “punished”, until this behavior is corrected. This aspect of Nepalese culture generally acts as a stimulant for domestic exploitation.Tamang, Jyotsna, Puri Mahesh, Lamichhane Prabhat, and Dulal Bishnu. \\"Women's Status and Violence against Young Married Women in Rural Nepal.\\" BMC Women's Health 11.1 (2011): 19. Web. However, according to Nepalese law, a woman has experienced domestic abuse if, and only if, she has suffered from forced sexual intercourse. Unfortunately, more times than not neither the woman assaulted, nor the man doing the abusing will report the crime. To make matters worse, even when it is reported, any form of consequential punishment is seldom executed.Mahesh, Puri, Frost Melanie, Jyotsna Tamang, Lamichhane Prabhat, and Shah Iqbal. \\"The Prevalence and Determinants of Sexual Violence against Young Married Women by Husbands in Rural Nepal.\\" BMC Research Notes 5.1 (2012): 291. Web. In 2009, a study was conducted to determine the association between selected risk factors and domestic violence of married women in Nepal, aged 15–24. Scientists were determined to solve this cycle of corruption before it spiraled out of control. The study concluded that approximately 51.9% of these women reported having experienced some form of violence in their lifetime, whether it be emotional, physical, or otherwise. In fact, 25.3% specified they had experienced physical violence, and a whopping 46.2% admitted they had been a victim to some form of sexual assault. These numbers not only shocked the research team, but started a chain reaction in the investigation of domestic violence in Nepal. According to a study by BMC Women's Health, logistic regression analysis found that the literacy status of Nepalese women, healthcare, age difference, and alcohol consumption had significant association with women's experience of sexual coercion in their marriage.Adhikari, Ramesh, and Jyotsna Tamang. \\"Sexual Coercion of Married Women in Nepal.\\" BMC Women's Health 10 (2010): 31. Web. The ProQuest Biological Science Collection also released a study, reporting that 21% of Nepalese men believe they are completely justified in physically abusing their spouse. In addition it showed that about 5% of these men find justification in using force to have sexual intercourse, and 3% that say they may rightfully commit adultery if their spouse is unwilling to have sexual intercourse at that specific time.Poudel-Tandukar, Kalpana, Krishna C Poudel, Junko Yasuoka, Takashi Eto, and Masamine Jimba. \\"Domestic Violence against Women in Nepal.\\" Lancet 371.9625 (2008): 1664. Web. Therefore, in order to solve the overwhelming issue of domestic violence in the country of Nepal, one must first address the husband's beliefs and cultural rituals. Men in Nepal desperately believe that it is morally right, and in some cases their civic duty, to discipline their wives in a physical manner. For the sake of the betterment of these women, the overall male belief system must be altered. Scientists studying the social aspects of Nepal believe that the domestic violence prevalent in Nepal can be traced back to 1996. In this year the Nepalese people endured the People's War, and its effects were felt for years to come. Depression, anxiety, and general distrust swept the country. Prior to the war, little violence had been recorded in Nepal.Kohrt, Brandon A, Daniel J Hruschka, Carol M Worthman, Richard D Kunz, Jennifer L Baldwin, Nawaraj Upadhaya, Nanda Raj Acharya, Suraj Koirala, Suraj B Thapa, Wietse A Tol, Mark J D Jordans, Navit Robkin, Vidya Dev Sharma, and Mahendra K Nepal. \\"Political Violence and Mental Health in Nepal: Prospective Study.\\" The British Journal of Psychiatry : The Journal of Mental Science 201.4 (2012): 268-75. Web. This prevailing rampage may also be due to the fact that compared to the unmarried youth of Nepal, a much higher proportion of married youth reported violence at home. Marriage is the underlying issue. The standards and expectations of marriage, as the people of Nepal understand it, are all wrong. A Nepalese marriage can be more easily related to a master and slave relationship, than a to husband and wife. Western marriages have set the expectations that a marriage should be based on foundations of love and trust, but systems such as the dowry subvert this notion in Nepal. Although a law was passed in 2009 called the Domestic Violence and Punishment Act 2066, it is rarely enforced or acknowledged. This law against sexual assault is so rarely executed that hardly any Nepalese women even know that it exists. Depending on the act committed, this law could send offenders to prison for up to six months. The outcome of these women's’ lives could be drastically positively influenced if they had a safe place to go and report the crimes committed against them. However, care needs to be shown not only after the act, but as a way to prevent the assault in the future. Equal attention needs to be given in encouraging inter-spousal communication from the start of the marriage, rather than condemning wrongful behavior later on. Economic empowerment goes a long way in women's change of status in the society. Ironically, even as this has been evidenced by several examples, women who are educated and economically independent have also been subject to domestic violence. The cycle of abuse is perpetuated because the social construct forbids women from speaking out due to the fear of shame or stigma. According to the census of 2011, the male literacy rate in Nepal was 71.1% whereas the female literacy rate was 46.7%. The approach of government programs and non-government projects on empowerment has provided some improvement in the scenario compared to the situation a few years back. The situation of women's education and employment in urban area is somewhat progressing but the condition is rural areas is still the same. As most women in Nepal are working as the unpaid labor force in the family and more than 76% of women are involved in agriculture, there is no recognition of their contribution to the economic advantages that the family gets in return. In Nepal only 19% of women have ownership of the fixed assets, whereas 25% of women are head of households. The government and the legal system in Nepal also reflect the patriarchal attitudes. Legally a daughter cannot claim the property of the father, and a woman is entitled to the husband's property. The data and the legal provisions also reflects that women don't have equal access to economic resources which restrict them to make decisions on the property and economy and leaving them behind in society. The country's strategy 2013-2017 identifies women's inequality as the hindrance for development and thus this strategy addresses in the empowerment of women in social, political and government systems. With the first woman President, first woman Speaker of the House and first woman chief justice, there is some hope that people will see positive changes in terms of empowering women via education and economic access. Chhaupadi Chhaupadi is a social practice that occurs in the western part of Nepal for Hindu women, which prohibits a woman from participating in normal family and social activities during menstruation. Women are considered impure during this time, and are kept out of the house and have to live in a shed. Although chhaupadi was outlawed by the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2005, the tradition is slow to change. After a woman died in a Chauppadi hut in 2016, the government passed a law imposing punishment against those forcing women into the tradition, entering into effect in August, 2018.The Kathmandu Post, Access Date 12 December 2016  Witch-hunts  Witch-hunts in Nepal are common, and are targeted especially against low- caste women. The main causes of witchcraft related violence include widespread belief in superstition, lack of education, lack of public awareness, illiteracy, caste system, male domination, and economic dependency of women on men. The victims of this form of violence are often beaten, tortured, publicly humiliated, and murdered. Sometimes, the family members of the accused are also assaulted. In 2010, Sarwa Dev Prasad Ojha, minister for women and social welfare, said, \\"Superstitions are deeply rooted in our society, and the belief in witchcraft is one of the worst forms of this.\\" Gallery File:Mother_and_Son_Durbar_Square_Kathmandu_Nepal_Luca_Galuzzi_2006.jpg|Nepali mother with child File:Young_female_of_Nepal.jpg|Young woman in Nepal File:GNC_in_Nepal.jpg|School girls in Nepal File:Portrait Of Nepali Woman.jpg|Portrait of Nepali Woman File:Messe-96.JPG|Young women dancers File:Venditrice_di_candele.jpg|Woman selling candles File:Purna Ajji.jpg|An elderly Nepali woman  See also  * Gender inequality in Nepal * Women's rights in Nepal  References  (Data from 18 91.)

The official position of the North Korean government is that women have equal rights with men.United States Department of State North Korea has enacted laws such as the Law on Sex Equality, the Labor Law, and the Law on Nationalization of Essential Industries. Although these social systems have not entirely been successful, they have been integrated into daily life to help women. The reforms implemented provided women's rights at work, rights of inheriting and sharing of properties, and rights of free marriage and divorce. North Korea also outlawed polygamy. The state confiscated all privately owned land, eliminating property discrimination. Today, women in North Korea participate in a variety of labor forces, and there is a considerable number of women who are in high positions. Also, there are many facilities for women including sanatoria, rest homes, and maternity hospitals. The ratio of women to men in high wage jobs is considerably lower than that of low wage jobs. In addition, most of women in the high positions in the society are either relatives or wives of top leaders. Irrespective of the reforms attempting to weaken patriarchal social structures, the political atmosphere is an example of the same patriarchal structure that the reforms intended to dissolve. This demonstrates the degree to which Neo-Confucian ideals still permeate and affect social and political policies. North Korea has not followed China and Vietnam in their campaigns against Confucianism.Halliday, Jon. \\"Women in North Korea: an Interview with the Korean Democratic Women's Union Journal.\\" Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 17 (1985): 46–47. Print. Before the division of Korea In the Joseon Dynasty, women were expected to give birth to and rear male heirs to assure the continuation of the family line. Women had few opportunities to participate in the social, economic, or political life of society. There were a few exceptions to limitations imposed on women's roles. For example, female shamans were called on to cure illnesses by driving away evil spirits, to pray for rain during droughts, or to perform divination and fortune-telling. Before the Yi Dynasty and Neo-Confucianism was introduced, women comparatively had more rights and freedom. Women during the Shilla period held higher positions and statuses (although not equal to those of men) in society and had many legal rights including the right to be considered the head of a household. Furthermore, during the Koryo period, remarriage of women as well as equal property inheritance between men and women was completely acceptable.Park, Kyung Ae. \\"Women and Revolution in North Korea.\\" Pacific Affairs Winter 65.4 (1992): 528. Print. However, as Korea entered the Yi Dynasty, Confucian ideology, was strongly adhered to by society and immensely affected the roles of men and women. From the young age of seven, males and females were separated and restricted to designated areas of the house: the outer part (sarangcha) for the males and the inner part (ancha) for the women. By Korean Confucian standards, \\"a virtuous woman obeyed men throughout her life: in youth, she obeyed her father; when married, she obeyed her husband; if her husband died, she was subject to her son.\\" Few women received any formal education in traditional Korean society. After the opening of Korea to foreign contact in the late 19th century, however, Christian missionaries established girls' schools, thus allowing young Korean females of any class to obtain a modern education. With the influence of Silhak, Tonghak, and Western thought, a priority interest focused on human rights and equality. Thereby in 1886, Ewha Haktang (Ewha School) was established as the first modern women's school. And in response to the Chanyang-hoe (Chanyang Association) and their emphasis on education for women, in 1908, the government established the first public girls' school called Hansong Girls' High School.Park, Kyung Ae. \\"Women and Revolution in North Korea.\\" Pacific Affairs Winter 65.4 (1992): 529–530. Print. During the Japanese colonial period, 1910–1945, Korean women experienced some social changes much like women did in the Western world. Urbanization and modernization in the early 20th century opened up opportunities for women in the workforce. Women moved from rural regions to cities to make new lives for themselves, often finding jobs at factories where they had regular salaries (a new phenomenon for women from rural farms), which were often sent home to supplement their families' income.Hwang, Kyung Moon. \\"A History of Korea.\\" Palgrave Macmillan, 2010. 166. These city girls had a newfound sense of independence and self-determination in employment and city life. However, the poor working conditions and long hours of early 20th century factories often limited their success and happiness.Hwang, Kyung Moon. \\"A History of Korea.\\" Palgrave Macmillan, 2010. 169. Other more fortunate women received education at secondary schools in urban areas. Some even had the chance to study abroad at more prestigious institutions in Japan. These women composed a new sector of the social elite and were participants in consumer culture. These women, dubbed \\"Modern girls,\\" took advantage of the new opportunities afforded to women in the 1920s and 1930s. They transcended limitations of the agricultural class by marrying urban professionals, participated in the burgeoning modern art and culture scene, and abandoned traditional Korean hanbok for Western attire. While the majority of Korean women still lived traditional lives, it was these \\"modern girls\\" that helped to transform the cultural landscape into a more contemporary and internationalist scene. Although many of these opportunities were not available to women in the countryside, the 1920s and 1930s did bring positive changes to rural areas. Women were trained and educated on a more limited scale, and there were movements to eradicate illiteracy.Hwang, Kyung Moon. \\"A History of Korea.\\" Palgrave Macmillan, 2010. 170. These movements towards education across the socio-economic spectrum would later influence and encourage North Korean communist activities. It aided in the spread of communist ideals and made it easier to educate and rally the people around communism. Women were also more involved in the public sphere – a continuation of the changes made during the colonial period. After the division = During the North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950 = The social status and roles of women were radically changed after 1945. Before the Korean War of 1950–1953, the communist regime in North Korea began reordering traditional Korean society to reflect the ideal communist society. The communist regime in North Korea granted women positions of importance and agency in their communities in its efforts to promote equality. One such example was the inminban, units of about 20–30 families that were often led by women.Lankov, Andrei. \\"The real North Korea: life and politics in the failed Stalinist utopia.\\" Oxford; Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 39. These women took care of building maintenance and finances and generally kept an eye on the lives of her constituents. According to the government, “an inminban head should know how many chopsticks and how many spoons are in every household.” The women also reported any suspicious activity to the police and conducted random checks. These inminban leaders directly contributed to the communist cause and culture of surveillance, serving in roles of leadership alongside their male counterparts.Lankov, Andrei. \\"The real North Korea: life and politics in the failed Stalinist utopia.\\" Oxford; Oxford University Press, 2013. 40. The regime also released a publication specifically for women, the Joseon Yeoseong, in order to further educate women on communist ideals. The publication included household tips, health advice, educational materials, and political propaganda.Kim, Suzy. \\"Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950.\\" Ithaca; Cornell University Press, 2013. 199. Women had other opportunities to be involved in nascent North Korean political culture. The regime encouraged people to join various groups – women's organizations were powerful and ambitious. One such organization was the Korean Women's Socialist League, which made demands to the North Korean government for paid maternity leave and the abolition of wage discrimination.Kim, Suzy. \\"Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950.\\" Ithaca; Cornell University Press, 2013. 201. They were also responsible for other social changes that included education, prenatal services, and women's lectures. Through organizations like this, women had some degree of agency under the North Korean regime. Women were not necessarily completely free, and their rights were limited. The regime held a tight grip the on women's daily lives during the revolution. For example, the state gave women a model schedule to follow, which required women to cook and clean and only allowed for an hour and a half of personal time at the end of the day. They were also expected to masterfully balance duties at home with duties for their organizations, a task that proved too exhausting and nearly impossible. Many women contributed to the economy during the North Korean Revolution as well. Women took on the roles of journalists, teachers, clerks, and more. These women were forward thinking in their reasons for being in the workforce, some expressing a desire to be trailblazers for future businesswomen.Kim, Suzy. \\"Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950.\\" Ithaca; Cornell University Press, 2013. 202. They still saw economic involvement as an uphill battle, though, because of the regime's emphasis on women's duties in the home. So, although women had political and economic agency in some ways, they were also tied to the home, and this disparity ultimately only reinforced traditional gender roles, even though the communist government stressed the importance of gender equality. Women's revolutionary role also became tied to motherhood, meaning that women were seen as revolutionary heroes, but only as mothers who raised proper socialist children.Kim, Suzy. \\"Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950.\\" Ithaca; Cornell University Press, 2013. 187. Mothers were seen as the “most sacrificial model citizen,” but despite this lofty ideological position, mothers were confined to the home and to the lower social strata. The government counted on mothers to instill strong communist values in their children and support the regime at the most basic domestic level. Thus, for most women, agency was situated in the home, not in the workplace or political sphere. During the first three months of the Korean War, the Korean People's Army installed similar women's organizations in the South during its occupation of South Korea.Armstrong, Charles K. \\"Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950–1992.\\" Ithaca; Cornell University Press, 2013, p. 36. =Post-Korean War= Women providing supplies for the military, June 1972, Hamhung After the Korean War, the population ratio between the two Korea's was drastically different because of the \\"intense bombing\\". The bombing took a major toll on North Korea leaving \\"no more targets left to hit, which did not even happen in Vietnam\\". Secondly, \\"the DPRK lost 12–15 percent of its population during the war...Just over half the Koreans dead were men\\". North Korea was used \\"to combat the legacy of [the] colonial past.\\" Because of these two factors, it affected the position of women in the DPRK. The importance on population growth was crucial to the development of North Korea. Women were \\" encouraged a high birth rate, partly by making contraception and abortion difficult to obtain\\".Halliday, Jon. \\"Women in North Korea: an Interview with the Korean Democratic Women's Union Journal.\\" Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 17 (1985): 47–48. Print. It was considered socially unacceptable for a woman to not have or want children. This position would eventually be reversed; many North Korean escapees located in China assert that forced abortions and infanticide are common within the country. Women's roles were just as important as the men's. The 1972 constitution asserted that \\"women hold equal social status and rights with men.\\"N. Korea Calls for Women's Increased Role in Economic Campaign. Yonhap. 6 August 2009. The fact that the women held the same roles in society and in the economy can be seen when \\"Women workers had increased rapidly, with \\"equal pay [for equal work] and special treatment\\".Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History. New York: Norton, 2005. 431. Print. In addition, the role of women becoming more significant to society and them being more than simple housewives could be seen.Cumings, Bruce. Korea's Place in the Sun: a Modern History. New York: Norton, 2005. Print. The 1990 constitution stipulates that the state creates various conditions for the advancement of women in society. In principle, North Korea strongly supports sexual equality, and established different policies regarding women's emancipation, however, in practice, North Korea remains a patriarchal, sexist society. When North Korea was established, it began applying communist principles of sex equality. North Korea believed they could obtain sexual equality through economic liberation and women's participation in economic production. For instance, Kim Il Sung said: \\"The Women... can achieve complete emancipation only if they strive with no less devotion and awareness than men to solve the problems arising on the productive fronts of the factories and countryside\\"\\"On the Founding of the Magazine,\\" p. 354 The purpose was to transfer women's duties outside the family into productive labor for the state. Thus, theoretically, women can obtain different social positions through nontraditional roles such as paid labor. The North Korean leaders were committed to changing traditional family, economic, and social systems and instituted new legal and social arrangements which promoted equal rights for both men and women.Park, Kyung Ae. \\"Women and Revolution in North Korea.\\" Pacific Affairs Winter 65.4 (1992): 540. Print. Political opportunities were given to women, especially in the lower echelons of the power regime. Regardless, \\"North Korean women can hardly be said to have achieved socioeconomic status equal to men's.\\" While economic strides were made to improve the status of women, it is clear that North Korean women did not have the equal power of property in comparison to North Korean men. Women are given occupations with a lower pay wage, allowing the men to become the main source of income for the North Korean family. By having men be paid more than women, it achieved a family structure that depends on men. Men would be considered as the primary earner and women were earning money by the side. As such, women who marry high-income earners have followed a trend of quitting their jobs and a majority of married women work at their homes. As result, there is clear declination of women workforce and the women mostly become very dependent on their husbands.Park, Kyung Ae. \\"Women and Revolution in North Korea.\\" Pacific Affairs Winter 65.4 (1992): 540–541. Print. This trend is seen clearly throughout the history of Korea, and it has deep roots in the Confucius ideals. It is also very hard to see many women in any position of power in North Korea. Women do hold one-third of the representative positions in the lower echelons of power, however, the lower echelons are not considered to hold any power over major decisions. \\"As one examines the more powerful organizations such as the Central Committee (CC) and the Politbureau (Political Committee) of the KWP Congress and the Administrative Council (the Cabinet), it becomes apparent that very few women have held positions of power.\\" Since women barely have any position in the higher positions of power, they are not well represented and do not hold any real power over the government. Although women position may have changed in the society since the Choson era, the deeply en-rooted Confucius culture is still very visible in contemporary North Korean society. =Chollima (Flying Horse) Movement= The Ch'ŏllima movement (Ch'ŏllima meaning \\"Thousand-ri horse\\" but translated as \\"Flying Horse\\")Koh, p. 641. was a mass mobilization campaign and North Korean government initiated Chollima movement to solidify its power in the late 1950s.Chollima movement was a mass mobilization campaign and North Korean government initiated Chollima movement to build socialist in the late 1950s. Chollima movement, which focused on women's policy, socialized North Korean women's housework thorough the help nurseries, kindergartens, laundries, and an efficient food industry.Park, Kyung Ae. \\"Women and Revolution in North Korea.\\" Pacific Affairs Winter 65.4 (1992): 536. Print One member of the Women's Union said the socialization of housework in North Korea as \\"Children are brought up at state expense. If there is pressing and ironing [to be done] it goes to the laundries. The foodstuffs industry has been developed, so food can be bought at any time. So what is there left to do in the family?\\"Halliday, Jon. \\"Women in North Korea: an Interview with the Korean Democratic Women's Union Journal.\\" Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 17 (1985): 53. Print. Chollima mass mobilization campaign increased the number of female labor. Female labor grew with the rate of over 19 percent between 1956 and 1964, which led to 49 percent of the total labor force.Park, Kyung Ae. \\"Women and Revolution in North Korea.\\" Pacific Affairs Winter 65.4 (1992): 537. Print. Also between 1963 and 1989, the number of female professionals and technicians grew 10.6 times when male professionals grew only 2.5 times. With the goal to continue raising positive statistics, women were being encouraged more and more to work towards achieving equal, if not greater, status as men had. =21st century= Choe Son-hui, appointed First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2018 In the 2010s, under Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un, several women have been promoted to powerful political and diplomatic positions. =Statistics= Data from 1980 indicates that women occupied 56% of the labor force in the agricultural sector, 45% in the industrial sector, 20% in mining, 30% in forestry, 15% in heavy industry and 70% in light industry.Tae Young Lee, Pukhan Yosonc (North Korean women) (Seoul, Korea: Silch'6n Munhaksa, 1988), p. 194. The heavy emphasis on light industry aims to raise poor living standards and combat the widespread shortage of food and consumer goods. In 1989, North Korea declared the \\"year of light industries\\" and shifted more women from heavy industry to light industry. Women accounted for 80% of the school teachers, but very low in the university scene. For example, In Kim Il Sung University, women composed 10% of the faculty and 25–30% of the students.Halliday, Jon. \\"Women in North Korea: an Interview with the Korean Democratic Women's Union Journal.\\" Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 17 (1985): 55. Print. Among professionals and technicians, women accounted for only 14.6% in 1963, yet in 1989 more than 37% were women. The number of female professionals and technicians increased 10.6 times between 1963 and 1989 while that of males increased only 2.5 times. Laws promoting social change on North Korean women The Provisional People's Committee promulgated various laws promoting social change, such as the Law on Land Reforms, the Law on Sex Equality, the Labor Law and the Law on the Nationalization of Essential Industries.Park, Kyung Ae. \\"Women and Revolution in North Korea.\\" Pacific Affairs Winter 65.4 (1992): 532. Print. The most progressive change in the traditional position of women was the Law on Sex Equality, announced on 30 July 1946. This law emphasized equal rights in all spheres, free marriage and divorce, and equal rights to inherit property and to share property in case of divorce. It ended arranged marriages, polygamy, concubinage, the buying and selling of women, prostitution, and the professional entertainer system.Park, Kyung Ae. \\"Women and Revolution in North Korea.\\" Pacific Affairs Winter 65.4 (1992): 533. Print. The North Korean Labor Law defined women's rights at work. Articles 14 through 17 stipulated the rights of mothers and pregnant women, including seventy-seven days of maternity leave with full pay, paid baby- feeding breaks during work, a prohibition against overtime or night work for pregnant or nursing women, and the transfer of pregnant women to easier work with equal pay. In addition, the Law on Nationalization of Essential Industries weakened the economic power of a patriarch by elimination of private property. Unlike in South Korea where women struggled to abolish the family feudal system, the Democratic Women's Union of North Korea replaced family registry system based on male lineage (family feudal system) with a new citizen registry system. Therefore, giving more power to the women in purchasing and owning land. A policewoman handling traffic in 2007 Due to these changes in society the family structure drastically changed from the traditional systems; clans eventually disappeared, the family lineage-book system was completely destroyed, and a nuclear family system began to emerge. Thus making women in society more equal to men. Although there are new laws created to make women more equal to men, it is highly arguable that women in North Korea are completely equal to men in society. Opportunities for women have been greatly expanded, however with certain aspects they are still not equal to men in society. There is evidence that the male gets paid higher than females in North Korea. Thus, the wage difference reflects the unequal representation of women in various occupational structures, which indicates a sexual division of labor. Military In early 2015, the North Korean government decided to make military service mandatory for all women living inside the country's borders. The intention is to improve the country's dwindling military forces. For women ages 17 to 20 that have graduated from middle and high school, enlistment is now a requirement. Prior to 2015, women only served on a voluntary basis, whereas men have always been forced to serve. The term of service differs, with women being free from the military at the age of 23 and men being bound for 10 years. This initiative was proposed to replenish the losses felt in the 1990s during the North Korean famine, when the country experienced widespread death, a low birth rate, and a high child mortality rate. This directive has resulted in much concern, seeing as in most North Korean families, women are the ones bringing in the money by working in illicit businesses. In 2003, in an annual Supreme People's Assembly, the government granted a small reprieve for members of the military, reducing the term for men from 13 to 10 years and for women from 10 to 7.Song Min, Choi. \\"North Korea Introduces 'mandatory Military Service for Women'\\" The Guardian. N.p., 31 January 2015. Web. Classes and castes Although North Korean government officials do publicly claim that North Korea as a country is a purely classless society, some have proven otherwise. There has been a clear divide between the wealthy, educated, and politically powerful citizens, in comparison to the politically powerless. There has been an obviously unequal distribution of wealth and privilege throughout North Korea. North Koreans have been forced to be placed into subdivisions in accordance with family history and origin. If at any point in time a member of a given family is to commit a crime of any sort, the entire line of that family suffers from their crime, by becoming even lower in status.Ryang, Sonia. \\"Culture of North Korea.\\" Advmeg Inc. 2015. Web. A woman's status has never been completely equal to that of a man. Men have a far better advantage of progressing through the workforce than women of a lower class. Lower class women are seen as having completed their career once married, which is not the case for men. On the other hand, women coming from higher ranking families are presented with much more opportunity. Division of labor In North Korea, heavy manual labor is traditionally done by men, and light work is appointed to women. An individual's employment is predetermined by the state in accordance to the state's judgement of family prestige, capability, and skill set. For example, it would be highly unlikely for the state to assign a wealthy family with a high education to work constant manual labor as a miner. Ultimately, for North Korean men and women, each citizen's occupation must be completely calculated and deliberated by outside authority. Role in the family Women's role in the family sphere and in the public sphere has changed several times from the end of World War II to this day. After the war, women were enrolled in the socialist economy in large numbers, and played a major role in the rebuilding of the country. As the economy improved in later decades, women were less needed in the workforce, and a move towards more traditional roles emerged. State employees were given rations and most families could survive on that. During the North Korean famine of the 1990s, these rations, known as the Public Distribution System, dried up and families had to look elsewhere for financial support. Men, even though they are not receiving payment, are still required to attend their government jobs. The cash-strapped government relies heavily on the free labor they get from men and it is unlikely to discontinue this practice anytime soon. For men to be free from work, they actually must pay their employer between 20 and 30 times their monthly salary, allowing them to take on other, more profitable jobs, such as repair work. This payment is required even if one is unable to afford food to eat, otherwise they are punished with jail time. It is rumored that the women of the family are the ones deciding if the men's skills are good enough to do this. Illegal markets began springing up all over the country out of desperation to keep people alive. These markets became the target of a number of crackdowns and restrictions but were later relaxed. These markets have become the main source of money for the vast majority of families in North Korea, with almost half of households claiming private trading as their only source of money. Although these numbers are difficult to come by in the iron-clad North Korea, researchers believe women are the breadwinners in 80–90 percent of homes. This dramatic change has had tremendous consequences in this patriarchal society. Women across the country, empowered by their new money-making abilities, have become less obedient to their husbands and have started controlling a lot of the household decisions. Many North Korean women refer to their husbands as \\"puppies\\" or \\"pets,\\" because they are unable to do anything productive but still must be taken care of and provided for. Women now make about twice and much as what men used to get paid. But with this change, women in this country are facing increasing domestic violence. Scholars who survey North Korean defectors claim they have yet to interview a woman that hasn't experienced some sort of violence in the home. They believe it is because of the immense power shift that has occurred inside the homes of people across the country. Men are frustrated with their new-found lack of power. Albeit with heavy obstacles, women are still leading the charge for civil disobedience, an unusual occurrence in North Korea. When new restrictions are imposed on the markets, women are very vocal and prominent in the protests. These changes have resulted in women preferring to wait longer to get married and men being forced to accept their subordinate roles as husbands. This power change in life has resulted in another in death: it is now men that are forced to beg when their spouse dies, instead of the other way around.Lim, Louisa. \\"Out of Desperation, North Korean Women Become Breadwinners.\\" NPR. NPR, 28 December 2012. Web. Prostitution Prostitution in North Korea is illegal, but is reported to take place, including through Kippumjo - women and girls recruited by the head of state of North Korea for the purpose of proving sexual gratification for high-ranking Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) officials and their families, as well as occasionally distinguished guests. Concentration camps Many women and girls are imprisoned, some of them in Yodok concentration camp. Media influence School girls at Mangyongdae Children's Palace The media showcases role models. The official newspaper Pyongyang Times, in an August 1991 article, described the career of Kim Hwa Suk, a woman who had graduated from compulsory education (senior middle school), decided to work in the fields as a regular farmer in a cooperative located in the Pyongyang suburbs, and gradually rose to positions of responsibility as her talents and dedication became known. After serving as leader of a youth work team, she attended a university. After graduating, she became chairperson of her cooperative's management board. Kim was also chosen as a deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly. Despite such examples, however, it appears that women are not fully emancipated. Sons are still preferred over daughters. Women do most if not all of the housework, including preparing a morning and evening meal, in addition to working outside the home; much of the responsibility of childrearing is in the hands of t'agaso (nurseries) and the school system. The majority of women work in light industry, where they are paid less than their male counterparts in heavy industry. In office situations, they are likely to be engaged in secretarial and other low-echelon jobs. Women were relieved of some of their domestic duties in order to shift their focus off their jobs. The food industry was developed to the point where women could just buy and pick up food for their families. Therefore, one of their main tasks became educating their children about communism based on their experiences. Different sex roles, moreover, are probably confirmed by the practice of separating boys and girls at both the elementary and higher middle-school levels. Some aspects of school curricula for boys and girls also are apparently different, with greater emphasis on physical education for boys and on home economics for girls. In the four-year university system, however, women majoring in medicine, biology, and foreign languages and literature seem especially numerous. Personal freedoms Women in North Korea, just like men, are severely restricted in everyday life: freedom of speech, freedom of movement and similar rights are tightly controlled by the state. Even personal decisions such as one's hairstyle are not free.  Historical significance  North Korean women have played an important role in society, politics, and economics, especially during the 20th and 21st Centuries. Their significant involvement in social and political organizations helped to shape North Korean communism and spread the regime's socialist ideals. Women's organizations like the Korean Women's Socialist League provided an outlet for women to express their daily concerns and to be active towards the communist cause. Women's political and workers' organizations were ultimately pivotal to the success of the North Korean revolution – the revolution featured participation from women (through organizations) as well as men, unlike many other political revolutions in the West that were based on male support. Because the revolution harnessed support from both genders, its impact was much more thorough and widespread, influencing every member of the community regardless of gender. That would not have been possible without the involvement of North Korean women. Additionally, North Korean women are truly the masters of the house. Traditional Korean society limited women to working within the home, and the North Korean revolution twisted that traditional value into a channel for heroism. Because women's agency has always been in the home (before and during the modern era), they have served as the main instillers of ideology in the North Korean population. Their role as mothers, again, has been a main source of success for the communist regime. It is the women who indoctrinate children and manage the ideal communist household (as dictated by the North Korean government). While this permanent place in the home might go against communist gender equality ideals, women's role in the historical development of the regime is nonetheless undeniable. Today, North Korean women exercise new forms of power, yet are simultaneously excluded from positions of real power. For example, North Korean women are the leaders of the underground (and illegal) markets. Many women are entrepreneurs, using creativity and resourcefulness to provide for their families during times of economic hardship. It is often the women who are earning money and bringing food for their families when traditional communist means of employment cannot suffice. At the same time, while some women have gained economic power, women are grossly underrepresented in the upper echelons of politics. There are very few female leaders in the Communist Party, despite their involvement in everyday politics. Although the Gender Equality Law of 1946 states in Article 2 that North Korean women have the same rights as men to vote and hold political office, few women have been able to break into the most powerful offices.Kim, Suzy. \\"Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950.\\" Ithaca; Cornell University Press, 2013. 196. Over time, women in North Korea have made significant strides towards equality. They have experienced success with gender equality legislation, women's organizations, economic entrepreneurship, and more. However, their progress has been severely stunted by the economic failings of their country and the persistence of chauvinist ideals (keeping women in the home, highlighting women's roles as mothers, etc.). Despite these challenges, women are still significant, if not essential, contributors to the development of the North Korean state.

Stockinger (Karl Markovics) leaves the series to return to Salzburg where his wife (who did not appear in the original series) has inherited a dental practice from her late father. He is appointed as Bezirksinspektor (District Inspector) at the Landes Gendarmerie (provincial police force), sharing an office with District Inspector Antonella Simoni (Sandra Cervik). Unlike the members of the team in Rex, who appear to be self- directed and are seldom seen to answer to senior management, Stockinger reports to Dr Brunner (Herr Hofrat), a philosophising bureaucratic senior police inspector. Stockinger is portrayed as a clumsy, almost Inspector Clouseau-like character, driving a clapped-out 1973 VW Variant, but single- minded when following up clues. The series was first broadcast in Australia in February 2008 on SBS television. SBS was responsible for the English subtitles therefore bringing the series to a wider audience than simply those with a knowledge of the German language. SBS also provided the English subtitles for all the Inspector Rex series. The series has since been released in two parts on DVD.

The core of the band consisted of Jordan Pratt, Luke Rogalsky, Bean (Chris Switzer) and Shane Ward. History =Early years= The band started in 1990 in Chilliwack, BC. The young band quickly grew a strong following around the Vancouver area with their strong musicianship, ear-splitting volume, unconventional, progressive song structures and often volatile and confrontational live shows. After winning the Vancouver Shindig contest the band was signed to Nettwerk Records. The band released their first album, Glazed, in 1993 and toured extensively in support of the album. Before working on a new record, Bean left the band and was replaced by Norm Thody from the band Captain Gravity. =10 Speed= In 1994, Mystery Machine headed back into the studio to record their second album. Entitled 10 Speed, it was a shift from progressive leanings of Glazed. The bands love for English shoe-gazers like My Bloody Valentine, Swervedriver and Ride was becoming more apparent. The album was as commercially successful as Mystery Machine ever got. The single \\"Pound For Pound\\" made its way onto the soundtrack for Foxfire, and the video for the single \\"Brand New Song\\" was nominated for a Much Music Video Award. After releasing the record, Bean returned and the band hit the road again. =Headfirst Into Everything= Now with momentum from 10 Speed, the band entered Bryan Adams' Warehouse Studios to record their third record, Headfirst Into Everything, in 1997. With an elevated budget, slick production and less complicated arrangements, the album was to be their most accessible record to date. Unfortunately, the record did not meet its commercial expectations, promotion for the record was limited and the band was dropped from Nettwerk. Around this time, Dean Young (also from the band Captain Gravity) was added as a third guitar player. =Montana= In 1999, Jordan left Mystery Machine to concentrate on his other band, The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets. The rest of the band carried on under the name Montana with Mario Nieva filling the vacant drumming position. Montana was meant to be a departure from the noise rock of Mystery Machine with the band taking more of an American singer/songwriter approach a la Tom Petty. Keyboardist Cary \\"Cozy Pines\\" Britton was added to fill out the line up. Although the band was well received, Montana never quite captured public interest. =Hiatus and reunion shows= With children, mortgages and other projects becoming more of a priority, the band stopped rehearsing on a regular basis. In 2004, Mystery Machine reformed with Luke, Shane, Bean from the original line-up and Mario, the drummer from Montana. They played a couple of \\"reunion\\" shows in Vancouver. This line up has stayed intact up until the present and has continued to write and record when the opportunity provided. =Western Magnetics= Western Magnetics is Mystery Machine's fourth album, released in September 2012 on Sonic Unyon Records.

It is important to note that since Russia is a multicultural society, the experiences of women in Russia vary significantly across ethnic, racial, religious, and social lines. The life of an ethnic Russian woman can be dramatically different from the life of a Bashkir, Chechen, or Yakuts (Sakha) woman; just as the life of a woman from a lower- class rural family can be different from the life of a woman from an upper- middle-class urban family. Nevertheless, a common historical and political context provides a room for speaking about women in Russia in general. History Natalya Gorbanevskaya in Moscow, 2005 Archaeological evidence suggests that the present day territory of Russia was inhabited since prehistoric times: 1.5-million-year-old Oldowan flint tools were discovered in the Dagestan Akusha region of the north Caucasus, demonstrating the presence of early humans in Russia from a very early time. The direct ancestors of Russians are the Eastern Slavs and the Finno-Ugric peoples. For most of the 20th century, the history of Russia is essentially that of the Soviet Union. Its fall in 1991 led, as in most of the former communist bloc countries of Eastern Europe, to an economic collapse and other social problems. Women in Russia are not a monolithic group, because the country itself is very diverse: there are almost 200 national/ethnic groups in Russia (77.7% being Russians - as of 2010), and although most of the population is (at least nominally) Christian Orthodox, other religions are present too, such as Islam (approximately 6% - see Islam in Russia). Famous women in Russian history include Anna of Russia, Elizabeth of Russia, Catherine the Great, and Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova. Eighteenth-century Russia Young women offer berries to visitors to their izba home, 1909. Photograph by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky. Women of eighteenth-century Russia were luckier than their European counterparts in some ways; in others, the life of a Russian woman was more difficult. The eighteenth-century was a time of social and legal changes that began to affect women in a way that they had never before experienced. Peter the Great ruled Russia from 1682–1725 and in that time brought about many changes to Russian culture, altering the orthodox traditions that had been observed since the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1450's. The three major social classes present during these reforms experienced changes in varying degrees according to their proximity to the tsar and urban settings where reforms could be more strictly enforced. Large cities underwent the westernization process more rapidly and successfully than the outlying rural villages. Noblewomen, merchant class women, and peasant (serf) women each witnessed Petrine reforms differently. For the lower classes it was not until the end of the eighteenth-century (during the time of Catherine the Great’s reign) that they began to see any changes at all. When these reforms did begin to change women’s lives legally, they also helped to expand their abilities socially. The Petrine reforms of this century allowed for more female participation in society, when before they were merely an afterthought as wives and mothers. “The change in women’s place in Russian society can be illustrated no better than by the fact that five women ruled the empire, in their own names, for a total of seventy years.” =Legal changes= Arguably the most important legal change that affected women's lives was the Law of Single Inheritance instituted by Peter the Great in 1714. The law was supposed to help the tax revenue for Russia by banning the allowance of noble families to divide their land and wealth among multiple children. This law effectively ended the practice of excluding women from inheriting patrimonial estates. The Law of Single Inheritance was clarified in the decree of 1725. It sought to address the question of married daughter’ inheritance rights. The law mandated that if a man was survived by unmarried daughters, the eldest girl would inherit his estate, while the remaining sisters would divide his movable property. His married daughters would receive nothing, however, since they would have received dowries at the time they married. In 1730 Anna Ivanova revoked the Law of Single Inheritance, as it had been a major point of contestation among the nobility since Peter first announced it in 1714. After 1731, property rights were expanded to include inheritance in land property. It also gave women greater power over the estates in that had been willed to them, or received in their wedding dowry. =Education for women= In pre- Petrine centuries the Russian tsars had never been concerned with educating their people, neither the wealthy nor the serfs. Education reforms were a large part of Petrine westernization; however, it was not until Catherine II's reforms that education rights applied to both men and women of each class. Education for girls occurred mainly in the home because they were focused on learning about their duties as wife and mother rather than getting an education. “The provision of formal education for women began only in 1764 and 1765, when Catherine II established first the Smolny Institute for girls of the nobility in St. Petersburg and then the Novodevichii Institute for the daughters of commoners.” =Women in the nobility= In the eighteenth-century Petrine reforms and enlightenment ideas brought both welcome and unwelcome changes required of the Russian nobility and aristocratic families. Daughters in well-to-do families were raised in the terem, which was usually a separate building connected to the house by an outside passageway. The terem was used to isolate girls of marriageable age and was intended to keep them \\"pure\\" (sexually inexperienced). These girls were raised solely on the prospect of marrying to connect their own family to another aristocratic family. Many rural and urban lower classes houses had no space to separate young women so there was no designated terem to keep them isolated. Women of lower classes had to live and work with their brothers, fathers, and husbands as well as manage all household matters along with them. Marriage customs changed gradually with the new reforms instituted by Peter the Great; average marriageable age increased, especially in the cities among the wealthier tier of people closest to the tsar and in the public eye. “By the end of the eighteenth-century, brides in cities were usually fifteen to eighteen years old, and even in villages young marriages were becoming more and more rare.” Marriage laws were a significant aspect of the Petrine reforms, but had to be corrected or clarified by later tsars because of their frequent ambiguities. In 1753, a decree was issued to assure that noble families could secure their daughter's inheritance of land by making it a part of the dowry that she would have access to once she was married. The constant change in property rights was an important part of the Petrine reforms that women witnessed. Family as well as marriage disputes often went to the court system because of the confusion about the dowry, and the rights it was supposed to ensure, in the event of a father's death or in disputed divorces. For women, the right to own and sell property was a new experience that only came because of Russia's gradual westernization in the eighteenth century. =Women in the merchant class= Merchant class women also enjoyed newly granted freedoms to own property and manage it; with this new right upper class women gained more independence from their patriarchal restrictions. Wives of merchant class men had more independence than wives of the nobility or peasants because of the nature of their husband's work, especially when their husbands were away from home on government service, as they were frequently and for long periods of time. The rights of married women from the nobility and merchantry to own and manage their own property offered them an opportunity to become involved in commercial and manufacturing ventures. =Women in the peasantry= A life among the peasant class was hard whether that peasant was male or female; each led lives filled with strenuous labor. They participated in work in the fields and in the making of handicrafts. Women were expected to do domestic work such as cooking, weaving clothes, and cleaning for their families. During planting and harvest time, when help was needed in the fields, women worked with their husbands to plow, sow seeds, then collect and prepare the crops. Early in the eighteenth-century, the average age for peasant girls to marry was around twelve years old. At this time they were still learning what would be expected of them as wives and also needed their parent's consent to marry. “The requirement of the law code of 1649 that girls not marry before the age of fifteen was rarely observed.” Various permissions for marriage were required; widows and unmarried women living on government owned property had to obtain the permission of the village assembly before they could marry anyone. Young peasant women (like other Russian women) spent far more of their child-bearing years as married women than their counterparts in Western Europe did. Childbirth was dangerous for both mother and child in the eighteenth-century but if a peasant woman was able to, she could potentially give birth, on average, to seven children. In the harsh climate of the Russian steppe, and a life of labor from an early age, perhaps half of all children would live to adulthood. “The birth of her first child, preferably a son, established her position in her husband’s household. As she continued to bear sons, her status further improved.” Russian peasant families needed help in the fields and to manage the household; not being able to hire anyone for these tasks, children were the only way to get the help they needed. Having a son ensured that the family name would continue as well as any property they might own, though as Petrine reforms came into effect, it began to be equally profitable to have a girl. However, women of any class could turn infrequently to the ecclesiastical courts to resolve their marital conflicts. 1850 to 1917 A lesson at Smolny Institute school for girls, 1913-1914 Anna Filosofova By the mid-nineteenth century, European notions of equality were starting to take hold in Russia. In 1859 St. Petersburg University allowed women to audit its courses, but the policy was revoked just four years later. In the 1860s a feminist movement began to coalesce in St. Petersburg. It was led by Anna Filosofova, Nadezhda Stasova, and Mariia Trubnikova, who together were known as the \\"triumvirate.\\" Along with members of the St Petersburg literati, such as Evgenia Konradi, they petitioned universities to educate women and wrote to prominent male figures to support their cause. This group also founded organizations to help unattached women become financially self-sufficient, and in 1878 they created the Bestuzhev Courses, which for the first time gave Russia's women reliable access to higher education. By the early 1900s Russia boasted more female doctors, lawyers, and teachers than almost any country in Europe—a fact noted with admiration by many foreign visitors. However, most of these educational benefits were being reaped by urban women from the middle and upper classes. While literacy rates were slowly spreading throughout the country, educational and other opportunities for peasant women were still relatively few. In 1910, Poliksena Shishkina-Iavein, the first female gynecologist in Russia, became president of the Russian League for Women's Rights. The League made universal women's suffrage its primary goal, and under Shishkina-Iavein's leadership the women's suffrage movement gained a great deal of popular support, both in Russia and abroad. In March 1917, the Provisional Government, which had replaced Nicholas II's autocracy, granted Russia's women the right to vote and hold political office. It was the first such reform enacted by a major political power.Ruthchild, R. (2010). Equality & revolution : Women's rights in the Russian Empire, 1905-1917 (Series in Russian and East European studies). Pittsburgh, Pa.: University of Pittsburgh Press. Soviet era: feminist reforms The Constitution of the USSR guaranteed equality for women - \\"Women in the USSR are accorded equal rights with men in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social, and political life.\\" (Article 122).Constitution of the USSR. Moscow: Co-operative Pub. Society of Foreign Workers in the U.S.S.R., Chapter 10, 1936 During the 70 years of the Soviet era, women's roles were complex.Ilič, Melanie. Women in the Stalin Era. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave, 2001., 2 Women in Soviet Russia became a vital part of the mobilization into the work force, and this opening of women into sectors that were previously unattainable allowed opportunities for education, personal development, and training. The responsibilities of the ideal industrial Soviet woman meant that she matched working quotas, never complained, and did everything for the betterment of Soviet Russia. These expectations came in addition to the standards demanded of women in the domestic sphere. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 established legal equality of women and men. Lenin saw women as a force of labor that had previously been untapped; he encouraged women to participate in the communist revolution. He stated: \\"Petty housework crushes, strangles, stultifies and degrades [the woman], chains her to the kitchen and to the nursery, and wastes her labor on barbarously unproductive, petty, nerve-racking, stultifying and crushing drudgery.\\" Bolshevik doctrine aimed to free women economically from men, and this meant allowing women to enter the workforce. The number of women who entered the workforce rose from 423,200 in 1923 to 885,000 in 1930.Goldman, Wendy Z. Women at the Gates: Gender and Industry in Stalin's Russia. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002., 12 To achieve this increase of women in the workforce, the new communist government issued the first Family Code in October 1918. This code separated marriage from the church, allowed a couple to choose a surname, gave illegitimate children the same rights as legitimate children, gave rights to maternal entitlements, health and safety protections at work, and provided women with the right to a divorce on extended grounds.Engel, Barbara Alpern; Anastasia Posadskaya- Vanderbeck, and Sona Stephan Hoisington. A Revolution of Their Own: Voices of Women in Soviet History.71 In 1920 the Soviet government legalized abortion. In 1922 marital rape was made illegal in the Soviet Union.The first criminal law code in Soviet Russia differed from Tsarist law on rape: \\"although the Tsarist law explicitly excluded marital rape, the Soviet law code of 1922 did not.\\" Marital rape was explicitly included in the 1960 code. Labor laws also assisted women. Women were given equal rights in regard to insurance in case of illness, eight-week paid maternity-leave, and a minimum wage standard that was set for both men and women. Both sexes were also afforded paid holiday- leave.Buckley, Mary. Women and Ideology in the Soviet Union. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989, p.35 The Soviet government enacted these measures in order to produce a quality labor-force from both of the sexes. While the reality was that not all women were granted these rights, they established a pivot from the traditional systems of the Russian imperialist past. To oversee this code and women's freedoms, the All-Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) set up a specialist women's department, the ZhenotdelIlič, Melanie. Women in the Stalin Era. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave, 2001, p.138 in 1919. The department produced propaganda encouraging more women to become a part of the urban population and of the communist revolutionary party. The 1920s saw changes in the urban centers of family policy, sexuality, and women's political activism. The creation of the \\"new soviet woman\\", who would be self-sacrificing and dedicated to the revolutionary cause, paved the way for the expectation of women to come. In 1925, with the number of divorces increasing, the Zhenotdel created the second family plan, proposing a common-law marriage for couples that were living together. However, a year later, the government passed a marriage law as a reaction to the de facto marriages that were causing inequality for women.Buckley, Mary. Women and Ideology in the Soviet Union. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989, p.40 As a result of the policy implementation of the New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1921-1928, if a man left his de facto wife, she was left unable to secure assistance. Men had no legal ties and as such, if a woman got pregnant, he would be able to leave, and not be legally responsible to assist the woman or child; this led to an increase in the number of homeless children. Because a de facto wife enjoyed no rights, the government sought to resolve this through the 1926 marriage law, granting registered and unregistered marriages equal rights and emphasized the obligations that came with marriage. The Bolsheviks also established \\"women's soviets\\" ( - singular: ) to cater for and support women. In 1930 the Zhenotdel disbanded, as the government claimed that their work was completed. Women began to enter the Soviet workforce on a scale never seen before. However, in the mid-1930s there was a return to more traditional and conservative values in many areas of social and family policy. Abortion became illegal, homosexuality was declared a crime, legal differences between legitimate and illegitimate children were restored, and divorce once again became difficult to attain.Engel, Barbara Alpern. 1987. \\"Women in Russia and the Soviet Union\\". Signs 12 (4). University of Chicago Press: 781–96. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174213., 788 Women became the heroines of the home and made sacrifices for their husbands and were to create a positive life at home that would \\"increase productivity and improve quality of work\\".Buckley, Mary. Women and Ideology in the Soviet Union. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989, p.117 The 1940s continued the traditional ideology - the nuclear family was the driving force of the time. Women held the social responsibility of motherhood that could not be ignored. Some local women's organizations also existed. For example, a group of Azeri Bolshevik women in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic founded (1920) the Ali Bayramov Club, a women's club dedicated to the unveiling of Muslim women, promoting female literacy, giving women opportunities for vocational training and employment, and organizing leisure and cultural events.Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94. During the Stalinist era (1927-1953), women also fell victim to the purges that plagued the country. From 1934 to 1940 the number of women imprisoned in the Gulag system rose from 30,108 to 108,898.Ilič, Melanie. Women in the Stalin Era. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave, 2001., 133 Women were not sent to hard- labor camps, but rather worked at camps that were textile- or sewing- factories, and were only forced to perform hard labor as a punishment. Women in the camps were often subjects of violence and/or sexual abuse. At the same time, \\"Thank you literature\\" arose as a result of the personality cult that Stalin had implemented, and articles in women's magazines would praise Stalin for the work that he had done for women. During the Soviet Union's participation (1941-1945) in World War II, women exemplified the motherland and patriotism. Many became widowed during the war, making them more likely to be become impoverished. As men were called away to assist with the fighting, women stepped in - some took charge of state farms and large collective farms. In 1942 women made up over half of the agricultural labor force. Soviet women not only assumed roles in industry and agriculture: 8,476 girls joined the Red Army or the Soviet Navy to assist in the Great Patriotic War.Buckley, Mary. Women and Ideology in the Soviet Union. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989, p.121 The motto of the time became: \\"Soviet women gave all their strengthen to the motherland… no difficulties arising on the path to building peace could frighten them.\\" The Soviet authorities repealed the ban on abortion in 1955 - after almost 20 years of prohibition, abortion became legal again. After Stalin's death in March 1953, the Soviet government revoked the 1936 laws and issued a new law on abortion. Valentina Tereshkova in 1969 Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova (Russian: Валенти́на Влади́мировна Терешко́ва; born 6 March 1937) was the first woman to fly in space, having been selected from more than four-hundred applicants and five finalists to pilot the Vostok 6 mission on 16 June 1963. Before her recruitment as a cosmonaut, Tereshkova was a textile-factory assembly-worker and an amateur skydiver. In order to become a cosmonaut, Tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the Soviet Air Force, and thus she also became the first civilian to fly in space. During her three-day mission, she performed various tests on herself to collect data on the female body's reaction to spaceflight. The 1977 Soviet Constitution supported women's rights both in public life (Article 35) and in family life (Article 53). Yet the Constitution contained a degree of contradiction: although it ensured women's rights to education, in the workforce, and in the family; the emphasis on motherhood as the essential calling of women was strong. Women's Activism in Contemporary Russia, by Linda Racioppi, Katherine O'Sullivan. See pg 31-33. Rural Women in the Soviet Union and Post-Soviet Russia, by Liubov Denisova, pg 80-82. 1990s Most of the nominal state benefit programs for women continued into the post-Soviet era. However, as in the Soviet era, Russian women in the 1990s predominated in economic sectors where pay is low, and they continued to receive less pay than men for comparable positions. In 1995 men in health care earned an average of 50 percent more than women in that field, and male engineers received an average of 40 percent more than their female colleagues. Despite that, on average, women were better educated than men, women remained in the minority in senior management positions. In the later Soviet era, women's wages averaged 70 percent of men's; by 1995 the figure was 40 percent, according to the Moscow-based Center for Gender Studies. According to a 1996 report, 87 percent of employed urban Russians earning less than 100,000 rubles a month were women, and the percentage of women decreased consistently in the higher wage categories. According to reports, women generally are the first to be fired, and they face other forms of on-the-job discrimination as well. Struggling companies often fire women to avoid paying child care benefits or granting maternity leave, as the law still requires. In 1995 women constituted an estimated 70 percent of Russia's unemployed, and as much as 90 percent in some areas. =Abuse= Sociological surveys show that sexual harassment and violence against women increased at all levels of society in the 1990s. More than 13,000 rapes were reported in 1994, meaning that several times that number of that often-unreported crime probably were committed. In 1993 an estimated 14,000 women were murdered by their husbands or lovers,Russian Federation, the Russian Federation's National Report Prepared for the Fourth World Conference on Women. 1994:32. about twenty times the figure in the United States and several times the figure in Russia five years earlier. More than 300,000 other types of crimes, including spousal abuse, were committed against women in 1994; in 1996 the State Duma (the lower house of the Federal Assembly, Russia's parliament) drafted a law against domestic violence. =Women's organizations= Independent women's organizations, a form of activity suppressed in the Soviet era, were formed in large numbers in the 1990s at the local, regional, and national levels. One such group is the Center for Gender Studies, a private research institute. The center analyzes demographic and social problems of women and acts as a link between Russian and Western feminist groups. A traveling group called Feminist Alternative offers women assertiveness training. Many local groups have emerged to engage in court actions on behalf of women, to set up rape and domestic violence awareness programs (about a dozen of which were active in 1995), and to aid women in establishing businesses. Another prominent organization is the Women's Union of Russia, which focuses on job-training programs, career counseling, and the development of entrepreneurial skills that will enable women to compete more successfully in Russia's emerging market economy. Despite the proliferation of such groups and programs, in the mid-1990s most Russians (including many women) remained contemptuous of their efforts, which many regard as a kind of Western subversion of traditional (Soviet and even pre-Soviet) social values. =Employment= The rapidly expanding private sector has offered women new employment opportunities, but many of the Soviet stereotypes remain. The most frequently offered job in new businesses is that of sekretarsha (secretary/receptionist), and advertisements for such positions in private-sector companies often specify physical attractiveness as a primary requirement (a requirement that is illegal in governmental organizations). Russian law provides for as much as three years' imprisonment for sexual harassment, but the law rarely is enforced. Although the Fund for Protection from Sexual Harassment has blacklisted 300 Moscow firms where sexual harassment is known to have taken place, demands for sex and even rape still are common on-the-job occurrences. The law lists 100 occupationshttp://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201908150010?index=0&rangeSize;=1 that are forbidden to women, as they are considered too dangerous to their health, especially reproductive health (until 2019 the figure was 456 ). =Political participation= Women's higher profile in post-Soviet Russia also has extended to politics. At the national level, the most notable manifestation of women's newfound political success has been the Women of Russia party, which won 11 percent of the vote and twenty-five seats in the 1993 national parliamentary elections. Subsequently, the party became active in a number of issues, including the opposition to the military campaign in Chechnya that began in 1994. In the 1995 national parliamentary elections, the Women of Russia chose to maintain its platform unchanged, emphasizing social issues such as the protection of children and women rather than entering into a coalition with other liberal parties. As a result, the party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold of votes required for proportional representation in the new State Duma, gaining only three seats in the single-seat portion of the elections. The party considered running a candidate in the 1996 presidential election but remained outside the crowded field. A smaller organization, the Russian Women's Party, ran as part of an unsuccessful coalition with several other splinter parties in the 1995 elections. A few women, such as Ella Pamfilova of the Republican Party, Socialist Workers' Party chief Lyudmila Vartazarova, and Valeriya Novodvorskaya, leader of the Democratic Union, have established themselves as influential political figures. Pamfilova has gained particular stature as an advocate on behalf of women and elderly people. = Soldiers' Mothers Movement = The Soldiers' Mothers Movement was formed in 1989 to expose human rights violations in the armed forces and to help youths resist the draft. The movement has gained national prominence through its opposition to the war in Chechnya. Numerous protests have been organized, and representatives have gone to the Chechen capital, Groznyy, to demand the release of Russian prisoners and locate missing soldiers. The group, which claimed 10,000 members in 1995, also has lobbied against extending the term of mandatory military service. =Government officials= Women have occupied few positions of influence in the executive branch of Russia's national government. One post in the Government (cabinet), that of minister of social protection, has become a \\"traditional\\" women's position; in 1994 Ella Pamfilova was followed in that position by Lyudmila Bezlepkina, who headed the ministry until the end of President Boris Yeltsin's first term in mid-1996. Tat'yana Paramanova was acting chairman of the Russian Central Bank for one year before Yeltsin replaced her in November 1995, and Tat'yana Regent has been head of the Federal Migration Service since its inception in 1992. Prior to the 1995 elections, women held about 10 percent of the seats in parliament: fifty-seven of 450 seats in the State Duma and nine of 178 seats in the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. The Soviet system of mandating legislative seats generally allocated about one-third of the seats in republic-level legislatures and one-half of the seats in local soviets to women, but those proportions shrank drastically with the first multiparty elections of 1990. Contemporary situation Article 19 of the 1993 Constitution of Russia guarantees equal rights to women and men. Under the Labour law, women have the right to paid maternity leave, paid parental leave, and unpaid parental leave, that can be extended until the child is 3. Women now have for generations worked outside the home; dual income families are the most common: the employment rate of women and men is 66.1% and 76.2% respectively (age 15-64, as of 2018). Nevertheless, women often face discrimination in the labour market; and the law itself lists 100 occupationshttp://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201908150010?index=0&rangeSize;=1 that are forbidden to women, as they are considered too dangerous to their health, especially reproductive health (until 2019 the figure was 456 ). Despite this, many Russian women have achieved success in business. The total fertility rate of Russia is 1.61 as of 2015, which, although below replacement rate of 2.1, is still higher than in the 1990s. In the post-Soviet era, the position of women in Russian society remains at least as problematic as in previous decades. In both cases, nominal legal protections for women either have failed to address the existing conditions or have failed to supply adequate support. In the 1990s, increasing economic pressures and shrinking government programs left women with little choice but to seek employment, although most available positions were as substandard as in the Soviet period, and generally jobs of any sort were more difficult to obtain. Such conditions contribute heavily to Russia's declining birthrate and the general deterioration of the family. At the same time, feminist groups and social organizations have begun advancing the cause of women's rights in what remains a strongly traditional society. While there has been an increase in the share of women in politics in Russia, this has not led to increased gender equality in Russian society overall. A 2016 study argues that it is because female politicians in Russia are \\"boxed in by informal rules and by parallel institutions and posts, with virtually no opportunities to advocate for women’s interests. Putin’s regime has promoted women to be “stand ins” during times of crisis or change, “loyalists” and “showgirls” when the regime needs to showcase elections and representation, and “cleaners” when the appearance of corruption threatens the regime.\\" =Decriminalization of domestic violence= In January 2017, the lower house of the Russian legislature decriminalized first time domestic violence. This applies to first offenses which do not cause serious injury, decreasing from a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment to a maximum of fifteen days in police custody.\\"Russian MPs pass bill to soften domestic violence law\\", BBC, 27 January 2017. It became an administrative offense, with the penalty for first offenses falling under the Administrative Code, these usually being fines or suspended sentences if the accused is a family member, which constitutes the vast majority of domestic violence cases. For second offense and beyond, it is considered a criminal offense, prosecuted under the Criminal Code. The move was widely seen as part of a state-sponsored turn to traditional values under Putin and shift away from liberal notions of individual and human rights. President Putin signed the bill into law in February 2017. The Guardian reported in February 2017 that \\"according to some estimates, one woman dies every 40 minutes from domestic abuse.\\" Women's sports Julia Lipnitskaia Russia has a long history of successful female skaters and gymnasts. Figure skating is a popular sport; in the 1960s the Soviet Union rose to become a dominant power in figure skating, especially in pairs skating and ice dancing; and this continued even after the fall the USSR. Artistic Gymnastics are among Russia's most popular sports; Svetlana Khorkina is one of the most successful female gymnasts of all time. Russian women are also internationally successful in many other sports, such as athletics, basketball, tennis and volleyball. Human trafficking As in other former communist countries, the fall of the state planned economy after the collapse of the USSR, led to increased socioeconomic problems, such as unemployment, insecurity and crime. This created a fertile ground for human trafficking, especially sex trafficking. Women and children who live in poverty are at most risk of becoming trafficking victims. Prostitution in Russia has spread rapidly in recent years, with women from small towns and rural areas migrating (willing or unwillingly) to big cities such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, Omsk, or Yekaterinburg to engage in prostitution. Russian women are also lured abroad with sham promises of jobs such as dancers, models, waitresses or domestic helpers and end up caught in forced prostitution situations. However, Russia has ratified the UN Trafficking Protocol, and has taken steps to curb this phenomenon.

Thus, gender roles and gender identities eventually have been modified as a result to changing modernity. More than half of Korean women are employed and furthermore, more than 25% of married women are employed as full-time workers.

For instance, in the National Assembly, women occupy 20 of the 299 seats. The status of women varies depending on their social class and financial independence. In metropolitan areas, women have more access to education, which means they are less confined to the home as housewives. Most of the employed women in urban areas work in tertiary industries such as the service sector. Therefore, as working-class women, they have more power in making decisions within their households and are more financially independent. On the other hand, in rural areas, most women work in a primary industry such as the agriculture sector. In fact, they do not have the variety of educational and employment opportunities. The status of women has elevated to the point where it could be seen as equal to men's social standing in terms of education, health, and legal rights. However, there are still plenty of political and economical prejudices against women. Moreover, Korean women are still consistently facing gender stereotypes regarding rigid gender roles. These stereotypes include women staying at home as housewives, being subordinate to men, having less power and voice in political and economic participation and movements, and many more. Women in South Korea are not restricted to dressing in a certain way, they follow a Western style of dress.  History  In traditional Korean society, women were taught to be subordinated without formal advanced education or little education. Their roles were limited to be confined to the home as housewives and good mothers. Their duties were to maintain harmony in the household by avoiding any unnecessary conflicts. In addition, a married couple was to live in her husband's household by taking care of her husband's whole family including parents-in-law. Women were expected to produce sons and they were blamed if children were girls due to a notion of preferring a son to a daughter. Women did not have the voice nor participate in society as men did, instead, they were expected to support their husbands. The improvement of women status was first found during the late 19th century to the early 19th century. A large number of Western Christian missionaries came to South Korea in order to institute modern schools. Among these modern schools, some of them established the schools with a goal to educate women in different fields including literature, arts, religious work, and many more. In fact, before the teachings of Western Christian missionaries, most of the women did not have any access to education. As a result, women were able to participate in political movement because women who got the education also engaged in enlightening other women. During the era under the colonial administration of imperial Japan, Korea women (almost Up to 200,000) were sent to work as comfort women in Japan's military brothels. Until the end of World War II, Korea was under Japanese occupation. Women participated in the independence movement against the Japanese occupation during Japanese colony during 1910-1945, therefore, the role of women has shifted slightly by having education and participating in political movements. After becoming independent from Japan, the Republic of Korea was established as a liberal democracy. Women who pursued education, work, and public life could now achieve constitutional rights for equal opportunities. For example, several schools were founded for the education of women. Women educated from these schools began to engage in the arts, teaching, economic activities, and engaged other women in discussion of gender equality. The percentage of women has steadily increased in professional fields which has resulted in significant contributions to society, especially in terms of increasing GDP. As they took a larger role in economic activities, the educational level of women also increased, providing additional opportunities for professionalization. Today, Korean women receive high levels of education and actively participate in a wide variety of fields, including education, medicine, engineering, scholarship, the arts, law, literature, and sports. Women's participation in social and economic culture is expected to continue to grow and diversify after the election of South Korea's first female president, Park Geun-Hye. This is partially due to Park Geun-Hye's promise to promote a “women’s revolution” and provide support for childcare, increased opportunities for promotion, and salary equality. Furthermore, Park Geun-Hye also promised to make other advances for women, including: increase the representation of women, to facilitate women’s employment and provide support for female workers, to increase educational opportunities for women to be competitive in the labor market, to provide social welfare policies for women, to promote women’s involvement in various social activities. However, not all of these policies have manifested.  Legal rights  Nowadays, women in South Korea are guaranteed all the legal rights that men have. In 1948, women gained their legal rights to vote, drive, and own and inherit properties and assets. For instance, Korean females have access to all medical and healthcare services. All Korean citizens are guaranteed for national health insurance under the National Health Insurance Act. South Korea has worked on its way to implement gender equality by revising and changing any discriminative contents in its existing legislative laws since the 1980s. In fact, South Korea's constitution has achieved its goal of ensuring diverse gender equality legislation within a short period of time. Implementation of laws to prohibit gender inequalities and prejudice have increased the number of women in the workforce. Nevertheless, women's status in South Korea illustrates the fact that Korea still has a lot of room to be improved for gender equality. Therefore, the legislation and public rules have critical and significant roles to influence Korean cities to elevate the social structure substantially. South Korea outlawed marital rape in 2013.  Education  As it was shown above, in traditional Korean society, females could not have access to formal education and the literacy rate was low. The transition came in the late 19th century to the early 20th century when the Western Christian missionaries came to South Korea by establishing modern schools for girls. In 1886, Methodist missionaries found a primary school. In 1945, this primary school gained its status as a university, which is now called Ewha Womans University. Ewha Womans University is still known as the most prestigious women's university in South Korea. There were numerous women's schools established respectively. In the 1890s, Chongsin Girls' School and Paehwa Girls' School were established in Seoul, which is the capital city of Korea. There were about ten women institutions of higher education such as junior colleges, colleges, and university by 1987 in South Korea. In fact, the women enrolment for higher education was at 28%. In 1987, there were about 262,500 female students in higher education. Although more females had access to higher education compared to the past, there were only 16% of university and college women teachers in 1987. The growing number of women receiving a college education has meant that their sex role differs from that of their mothers and grandmothers. Many college-educated women plan independent careers and challenge the right of parents to choose a marriage partner. The often fierce battles between university students and police during the late 1980s included female participants. A correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review quoted a male student leader as saying that \\"short girls make great demonstrators, as they're very tough and very hard to catch.\\" Whether politically active South Korean university women will follow their Japanese counterparts, who demonstrated during the 1960s and 1970s, into a world of child-raising and placid consumerism remains to be seen. The number of employed married women, however, increased by approximately 12.6 percent annually in the years since 1977. In 1983 more women—51.8%—were employed in rural areas than in urban areas—37.9 percent. Most of the women working in rural areas were over the age of thirty, as young females (and males) tended to move to, and seek employment in, cities and industrial areas. Official South Korean statistics indicated that 43.6% of women were in the workforce by 1988. Prospects for lower-class women, however, were frequently grim. In some cases, they were obliged to become part of the \\"entertainment industry\\" in order to survive economically. According to one estimate, brothels, bars, massage parlors, discos, and what are known as \\"Taiwan style\\" barbershops (that is, those often employing a greater number of masseuses than barbers) employed as many as 1 million women, though not all were prostitutes. This underworld of abuse and exploitation had begun to be criticized and exposed by women's activists. In today's South Korean society, the Constitution ensures equal access to education for women and also eliminates any discrimination regarding receiving education based on gender. In 1970, the literacy rate was 87.6%. In addition, according to 2002 estimates, the literacy rate increased to 97.9%; 96.6% of females and 99.2% of males are literate. According to 2008 estimates, there is approximately a 99% enrolment rate for both elementary school and middle school. The enrolment rate for high school is at approximately 96.6%. This means that almost 99% of the current South Korean females have approach to primary and secondary education.  Family life  During the Goryeo and early Joseon Dynasty, it was customary for married couples to live in the wife's parents' household. This arrangement suggests that the status of women was higher than it was during the later period of the Joseon Dynasty. Neo-Confucian orthodoxy dictated that the woman, separated from her parents, had a primary duty of providing a male heir for her husband's family. According to this custom, once married, a woman had to leave her parents' household and then become a part of her husband's household. The relationship between wife and husband was often, if not usually, distant, aptly described by the Korean proverb: \\"By day, like seeing a stranger; by night, like seeing a lover.\\" Joseon Dynasty law prohibited widows from remarrying, though a similar prohibition was not extended to widowers. Further, the sons and grandsons of widows who defied the ban, like children of secondary wives, were not allowed to take the civil service examinations and become scholar-officials. The duty of a woman to her husband, or rather to her husband's family, was absolute and unquestionable. In traditional society, only men could obtain a divorce. A husband could divorce his spouse if she were barren—barrenness being defined simply as the inability to bear sons. The incompatibility of a wife and her in-laws was another reason for divorce. In contemporary society, both men and women have the right to obtain a divorce. Social and economic discrimination, however, make the lot of divorced women more difficult. The husband may still demand custody of the children, although a revision of the Family Law in 1977 made it more difficult for him to coerce or to deceive his wife into agreeing to an unfair settlement. The rate of divorce in South Korea is increasing rapidly. In 1975 the number of divorces was 17,000. In the mid-1980s, the annual number of divorces was between 23,000 and 26,000, and in 1987 there were 45,000 divorces. The tradition of total female submission persisted in Korean villages until relatively recent times. One Korean scholar who came from the conservative Chungcheong region recalled that when a high school friend died of sickness during the 1940s, his young bride committed suicide. Her act was commemorated in her own and the surrounding communities as an outstanding example of devotion to duty. Traditionally, men and women were strictly segregated, both inside and outside the house. Yangban women spent most of their lives in seclusion in the women's chamber. It is said that the traditional pastime of nolttwigi, a game of jumping up and down on a seesaw-like contraption, originated among bored women who wanted to peek over the high walls of their family compounds to see what the outside world was like. Economic necessity gave women of the lower classes some freedom as they participated in farm work and sometimes earned supplemental income through making and selling things. As of February 2015, adultery is no longer illegal in South Korea.Greg Botelho and K.J. Kwon, Court rules: Adultery no longer a crime in South Korea February 26, 2015 CNN.com  Professional life  According to The Economist's 2013 \\"Glass-ceiling index\\" of five indicators of friendliness towards working women, South Korea ranks the lowest of all OECD countries because of its lack of women in senior jobs. Historically, however, a small minority of women played an active role in society and even wielded political influence. These people included female shamans (mudang), who were called upon to cure illnesses, tell fortunes, or in other ways enlist the help of spirits in realizing the wishes of their clients. Despite its sponsorship of neo-Confucianism, the Choson Dynasty had an office of shamanism, and female shamans often were quite influential in the royal palace. The female physicians who treated female patients (because male physicians were forbidden to examine them) constituted another important group of women. Sometimes they acted as spies or policewomen because they could get into the female quarters of a house. Still another group of women were the kisaeng. Some kisaeng, or entertainers, were merely prostitutes; but others, were talented musicians, dancers, painters, and poets who interacted with their male patrons. The kisaeng tradition perpetuated one of the more dubious legacies of the Joseon past: an extreme double standard concerning the sexual behavior of married men and women that still persists. In the cities, however, many middle-class women have begun to break with these traditions. An interesting regional variation on traditional female roles continued in the late 1980s. In the coastal villages of Jeju Island, women divers swam in search of seaweed, oysters, and other marine products and were economically self-sufficient. Often they provided the main economic support for the family while the husband did subsidiary work — took care of the children and did household chores — in sharp contrast to the Confucian norm. The number of women divers was dwindling, however, and men were increasingly performing jobs in service industries. Ancestor worship was rarely practiced while female- centered shamanistic rites were widespread. The factories of South Korea employ hundreds of thousands of young women on shop floors and assembly lines making, among other things, textiles and clothes, shoes, and electronic components. South Korea's economic success was bought in large measure with the sweat of these generally overworked and poorly paid female laborers. In the offices of banks and other service enterprises, young women working as clerks and secretaries are indispensable. Unlike their sisters on Jeju Island, however, the majority of these women work only until marriage. There has been a tangible increase in the number of women joining the workforce. In 2014, the number of Korean women in the workforce was estimated to be 57%, whereas in 1995 the number 47.6%. The statistical increase in the number of employed women has not correlated with the equality of wage, as the gender wage gap reported in 2013 was 36.3%, the worst of all OECD nations present in the data. Although increasing numbers of women work outside the home, the dominant conception, particularly for the college-educated middle class, is that the husband is the \\"outside person,\\" the one whose employment provides the main source of economic support; the wife is the \\"inside person,\\" whose chief responsibility is maintenance of the household. While it is viewed as a societal norm that women be able to contribute to the finance of the household, the majority of the onus is placed upon men, Women tend to leave the labor force when they get married. Many women manage the family finances, and a large number join kye, informal private short-term credit associations that give them access to funds that might not be obtainable from a conventional bank. Probably the most important responsibility of married women is the management of their children's education. Women also claim much of the responsibilities of being a caretaker, as half of the women that voluntarily leave their mid-career or senior-level jobs do so due to family commitmentshttp://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey%20Offices/Japan/PDF/Women_Matter_An_Asian_perspective.ashx College-educated women in Korea tend to invest more time and capital to raising their children than individuals without a degree. but due to the declining population in Korea There has been a conscious effort to address these issues by the South Korean government, as \\"the government gives loans or subsidies to businesses to build childcare facilities, and more than half of all businesses now provide these. It also pays subsidies to businesses that offer more than 30 days of childcare leave a year, allow women to work less than full time, and re-employ women returning from maternity leave.\\" Despite these efforts, the number of women who regularly use these support systems composes a minority of the women who find themselves in this position. A major factor that influences these decisions is the declining birth rate in Korea, as Korea's birthrate of 1.19 per family put a greater emphasis upon the quality of education and care upon the one, or two children that the family will take care of. The Glass Ceiling for women has been tested in contemporary times. In 2012, Samsung promoted three women into executive roles, which was unusual for a company of its size. Samsung has also stated that it aims to have at least 10% of its executive positions to be held by women. In 2013 Kwon Seon-joo became South Korea's first female bank CEO, as the CEO of state-owned Industrial Bank of Korea.  Crime  Prostitution in South Korea is illegal, but according to one estimate, brothels, bars, massage parlors, discos, and what are known as \\"Taiwan style\\" barbershops (that is, those often employing a greater number of masseuses than barbers) employed as many as 1 million women, though not all were prostitutes. This underworld of abuse and exploitation has begun to be criticized and exposed by women's activists. South Korean women and girls have been victims of sex trafficking in South Korea. They are raped and physically and psychologically harmed in brothels, businesses, homes, hotels, and other locations throughout the country. In 2003, after recovering from a financial meltdown, the unemployment rate for women was 12% in the 15-29 age group. In 2006, women in the age group of 20-29 constituted 40% of the total unemployed population, the figure being roughly around 340,000. The high levels of unemployment for women has contributed to the growth of the Korean sex trade. There are an estimated 500,000-1,000,000 women who partake in the sex trade, that being approximately one in every twenty-five women. The prominence of the sex trade has given birth to the \\"Bacchus Ladies\\", grandmothers who trade sex and other favours on top of the energy drink Bacchus they sell, of which their name was coined after. South Korean law first acknowledged women as rapists in June 2013; in 2015, the first woman was charged with rape in South Korea. The woman, only identified with her surname Jeon, was also the first woman to be arrested for sexually abusing a man. As well, South Korea outlawed marital rape in 2013.

Sri Lanka was the first nation in the world to elect a female head of state, Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Bandaranaike won the election in 1960 after S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the preceding leader who was also her husband, was murdered by a spy. While Sri Lanka relatively excels when it comes to gender equality indices, there are still many underlying issues pertaining to gender inequality in Sri Lanka. Many Women in Sri Lanka choose to work, while some choose to work at home and care for children. In families relying on agriculture, women are in charge of weeding and help with the harvest. Among poor families, women also perform full-time work for upper class individuals. Moreover, the man's role used to be seen as providing his family with material support by looking after his business. At the center of the hierarchy are children, who mix freely and receive a great deal of affection from both sexes. Among the middle- and upper-income classes, education of children may last into their early twenties, and women may mix with males or even take on jobs that were in the past reserved for men. For poorer income children, they may go to work at an earlier age. Gender inequality In comparison to other countries in the region, Sri Lanka is ranked well on several gender equality indices. However, there are also some sources that question the validity of these indices. Furthermore, globally, Sri Lanka ranks relatively low on gender equality indices. Overall, this pattern of social history that disempowers females produces a cycle of undervaluing females, providing only secondary access to health care and schooling and thus less opportunities to take on high-level jobs or training. In a study by Dr. Elaine Enarson, this cycle in turn worsens the issue of low political participation and social rights.  Further reading  * References (Data as of 1988.)

Symptoms of these diseases can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, and lungs. The most common and most severe form is systemic lupus erythematosus.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms vary from person to person, and may come and go. Almost everyone with lupus has joint pain and swelling. Some develop arthritis. Frequently affected joints are the fingers, hands, wrists, and knees. Other common symptoms include: * chest pain during respiration * joint pain * painless oral ulcer * fatigue * weight loss * fever with no other cause * general discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise) * hair loss * sensitivity to sunlight * a \\"butterfly\\" facial rash, seen in about half people with SLE * swollen lymph nodes = Photosensitivity = Photosensitivity is a known symptom of lupus, but its relationship to and influence on other aspects of the disease remain to be defined. Causes of photosensitivity may include: * change in autoantibody location * cytotoxicity * induction of apoptosis with autoantigens in apoptotic blebs * upregulation of adhesion molecules and cytokines * induction of nitric oxide synthase expression * ultraviolet-generated antigenic DNA. * tumor necrosis factor alpha  Genetics  It is typically believed that lupus is influenced by multiple genes. Lupus is usually influenced by gene polymorphisms, 30 of which have now been linked with the disorder. Some of these polymorphisms have been linked very tentatively however, as the role that they play or the degree to which they influence the disease is unknown. Other genes that are commonly thought to be associated with lupus are those in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) family. There have been several cases where a single gene influence appears to be present, but this is rare. When a single gene deficiency does cause lupus, it is usually attributed to the complement protein genes C1, C2, or C4. The influence of sex chromosomes and environmental factors are also noteworthy. Usually, these factors contribute to lupus by influencing the immune system. Several studies also indicate a potential association of lupus with mutations in DNA repair genes = Age difference = Lupus can develop in any age, but most commonly in ages 15 to 44, with varying results. Typically, the manifestation of the disease tends to be more acute in those affected who are of younger age. Women are more likely to get it than men. Patients with juvenile-onset lupus are more vulnerable to mucocutaneous manifestations of the disease (alopecia, skin rash, and ulceration of the mucus membranes) than any other age group. However, patients with late-onset lupus have a much higher mortality rate. Nearly 50% of those with late-onset lupus die of their affliction. Women who are of childbearing age are also particularly at risk. = Differences in ethnicity = Substantial data have been found to indicate that certain ethnic populations could be more at risk for lupus erythematosus, and have a better or worse prognosis. Asian, African, and Native Americans are more likely to get lupus than Caucasians. Caucasians seem to generally have a more mild manifestation of the disease. Their survival rates after five years were typically around 94–96%, while patients of African and some Asian ethnicities had survival rates closer to 79–92%. The only documented ethnicity that had a higher survival rate than Caucasians were Koreans, who had survival rates nearer to 98%. Among Caucasians, the most common causes of death were complications involving the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system and malignancies.\\"Lupus Facts, Symptoms, Rash, Effects, Complications, and More.\\" WebMD, n.d.

Testing may include: *Antinuclear antibody (ANA) *CBC with differential *Chest X-ray *Serum creatinine *Urinalysis = Classification = Lupus erythematosus may manifest as systemic disease or in a purely cutaneous form also known as incomplete lupus erythematosus. Lupus has four main types: * systemic * discoid * drug-induced * neonatal Of these, systemic lupus erythematosus (also known as SLE) is the most common and serious form. A more thorough categorization of lupus includes the following types:James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Disease of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders.

A second-line drug is methotrexate in its low-dose schedule. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first new drug for lupus in more than 50 years to be used in the US, belimumab. In addition to medical therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy has also been demonstrated to be effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression due to the psychological and social impacts that lupus may have.

Cultural background Young woman in Tajikistan Tajik women selling bread at a market Tajik women and girls Tajikistan is a country in Central Asia, with a population formed largely of Tajikistani (84.3%), with a significant Uzbek minority of 13.8%, and smaller numbers of Kyrgyz, Russians, Turkmens, Tatars, and Arabs. Tajikistan is one of the poorest states of the former Soviet sphere. It is a largely rural and agricultural country: as of 2015, only 26.8% of the total population lived in urban areas. The country experienced a very turbulent period in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, with the 1992-97 civil war severely damaging its already weak economy. About 90% of the population is Muslim, with most of them practicing Sunni Islam. Women in Tajikistan, although living in a strongly patriarchal society, do have a very high literacy rate at 99.7% (as of 2015). Although the use of modern contraception is low (27.9% as of 2012), the total fertility rate is only 2.71 children born/woman (2015 estimate).  History  The Soviet era saw the implementation of policies designed to transform the status of women in Tajik society. During the 1930s, the Soviet authorities launched a campaign for women's equality in Tajikistan, as they did elsewhere in Central Asia. Eventually major changes resulted from such programs, but initially they provoked intense public opposition. For example, women who appeared in public without the traditional all-enveloping Muslim veil were ostracized by society or even killed by relatives for supposedly shaming their families by what was considered unchaste behavior. World War II brought an upsurge in women's employment outside the home. With the majority of men removed from their civilian jobs by the demands of war, women compensated for the labor shortage. Although the employment of indigenous women in industry continued to grow even after the war, they remained a small fraction of the industrial labor force after independence. In the early 1980s, women made up 51 percent of Tajikistan's population and 52 percent of the work force on collective farms, and 38 percent of the industrial labor force, 16 percent of transportation workers, 14 percent of communications workers, and 28 percent of civil servants. These statistics include women of Russian and other non-Central Asian nationalities. In some rural parts of the republic, about half the women were not employed outside the home in the mid-1980s. In the late Soviet era, female underemployment was an important political issue in Tajikistan because it was linked to the Soviet propaganda campaign portraying Islam as a regressive influence on society. Some argue that the issue of female employment was more complicated than was indicated by Soviet propaganda. Many women remained in the home not only because of traditional attitudes about women's roles but also because many lacked vocational training and few child care facilities were available. By the end of the 1980s, Tajikistan's preschools accommodated 16.5 percent of the children of appropriate age overall and 2.4 percent of the rural children. Despite all this, women provided the core of the work force in certain areas of agriculture, especially the production of cotton and some fruits and vegetables. Women were underrepresented in government and management positions relative to their proportion of the republic's population. The Communist Party of Tajikistan, the government - especially the higher offices - and economic management organizations were largely directed by men. In the last decades of the twentieth century, Tajik social norms and even de facto government policy favored a traditionalist, restrictive attitude toward women that tolerated wife beating and the arbitrary dismissal of women from responsible positions. In the late Soviet period, Tajik girls still commonly married while under-age, despite official condemnation of this practice as a remnant of the feudal Central Asian mentality. After the violent conflict of the 1990s, which destabilized the country, the 21st century saw a very weak economy, plagued by unemployment and social problems. As a result, large numbers of people, mainly men working in the construction industry or other low-skilled jobs, left abroad in search of work opportunities: by 2009 it was estimated that approximately 800,000 Tajiks were working in Russia. Women remaining at home often experience severe poverty, often resorting to subsistence farming. In 2003, it was estimated that 64% of Tajiks lived below the poverty line.  Domestic violence  Domestic violence in Tajikistan is very high, due to traditional Tajik patriarchal values, as well as a reluctance by the authorities to intervene in what is viewed in Tajikistan as a \\"private family matter\\".BBC News - Amnesty: Nearly half of Tajik women 'regularly abused' Nearly half of Tajik women have been subjected to physical, psychological, or sexual violence by their husbands or in-laws.Amnesty International - Tajikistan: Violence is not just a family affair: Women face abuse in Tajikistan Domestic violence is often seen as justified by Tajik society: a UNICEF survey found that 62.4% of women in Tajikistan justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him. Another survey also found that women and men largely agreed that it was justifiable for a husband or mother- in-law to beat a wife/daughter-in-law who had \\"talked back\\", disobeyed, left the house without permission, had not prepared dinner on time, or had not cared for the children properly. In 2013, Tajikistan enacted the Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence, its first law against domestic violence. NGOs working on women's issues first drafted the proposal in 2007. After no progress was made for three years, Muyasara Bobokhanova, a founder and head of the Association \\"Woman & Society\\", sought help from the President, requesting a working group made up of legislators, NGO representatives and other areas of government meet with international organizations to discuss the issue. Specific issues that were western, such as punishment, were removed from the original draft. Focus was directed toward prevention, through addressing the causes, such as unemployment and instability that lead to violence and ensuring that legal and psychological assistance is provided to victims. Forced and early marriage Although Tajikistan's laws prohibit forced and child marriage, these practices are common throughout the country, and very little is done to curb these customs. Rates of child marriage increased drastically during the civil war, when parents forced their daughters to marry, in order to protect their premarital chastity (that could be lost through rape, which could affect the 'reputation' of the family). Fear of the girl remaining unmarried is another factor, which also encourages parents to arrange early marriages, since it is not socially acceptable for a woman to not have a husband.  Women in local government  Women's involvement in local government is considered relatively low. In rural jamoats only 15.2% of elected deputies are women. The Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region in the east of the country had the highest share of elected female deputies in rural jamoats at approximately 21.2%.  Women in security  The OSCE Border Management Staff College was established in Dushanbe in 2009 with the aim to provide quality training for border security professionals from various government agencies. The emphasis of this program was to improve border security on the Afghan-Tajik border in the south of the country. At first the college attracted predominately male participants; the OSCE reported that from 2009 to 2013 approximately 90% of participants were men. The college then implemented special training programs for women to encourage gender equality and career opportunities for women in border security. A study by the International Organization for Migration found that female border guards were considered much better than their male counterparts in detecting human trafficking cases, de-escalating conflict situations and identifying fraudulent documents. The Tajik Border Forces has since been working to attract more women to the agency. So far, the college has completed six leadership training courses specifically for women in their work to promote gender equality and empowerment for women in border security and management.

The composition was written by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, Motown staff writers Al Cleveland and Terry Johnson, a former member of The Flamingos. Robinson, Johnson, and Miracles member Warren \\"Pete\\" Moore were the song's producers. \\"Baby Baby Don't Cry\\" was a top 10 pop hit for The Miracles, peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, and at a Top 10 R&B; hit as well, peaking as number three on Billboard's R&B; singles chart. It sold over one million copies, and has inspired cover versions by Gerald Wilson and His Orchestra, and Projekt. The song is noted for Smokey's spoken recitation at the beginning as well as before the second verse. The spoken lines are: \\"Nothing so blue as a heart in pain/Nothing so sad as a tear in vain\\", and \\"You trusted him and gave him your love/A love he proved unworthy of\\". The song uses an extended bridge that repeats the minor and diminished chords before going up half a step for the final repeated Choruses. Although not given writing credit on this particular tune, Miracle Marv Tarplin's outstanding guitar work plays an important role in this song, his gentle but effective riffs being evident from the song's beginning, giving a \\"raindrop\\" effect reminiscent of someone crying (the song's main theme). The Miracles performed this song on a 1969 telecast of The Mike Douglas Show, a performance that was re-broadcast many years later on VH-1. The success of this song ended a period of relatively mediocre chart action for The Miracles during 1968, and set the stage for their biggest hit ever with Smokey as lead singer, 1970's multi-million selling #1 hit \\"The Tears of a Clown\\".

Bealey came out to Canterbury in 1851, a pastoralist with capital to invest in farming. He married Rose Ann, daughter of Archdeacon Paul in 1852. Having made money, he returned to England, in 1867 and died there. His son Nowell managed Haldon (sheep) Station. Bealey stood for election in the Town of Christchurch electorate for the first Provincial Council on 3 September 1853. Five candidates contested the three positions, and Bealey received the second highest number of votes at 74. The two other successful candidates were Thomas Cass and Richard Packer (77 and 71 votes, respectively). Charles Fooks (a brother-in-law of Guise and Joseph Brittan) and Edward Dobson were defeated (at 51 and 21 votes, respectively). Bealey remained a provincial councillor until the dissolution of the first parliament on 14 July 1857. From October 1854 to May 1855, he was a member of the executive council during the superintendency of James FitzGerald. Bealey was again elected onto the Provincial Council on 8 May 1862, this time in the City of Christchurch electorate. He served until 5 March 1863, as on that day, he was elected the third Superintendent, a role which he held to 1866. In 1863 William Sefton Moorhouse was in financial crisis, and put in Bealey as Superintendent instead, as a \\"safe man\\", to keep his rival James FitzGerald out.

History The Bailiff provided the police function for the Town. Apparently there had been some provision for law enforcement prior the incorporation of the Town because a jail, known as “The Dungeon” had been erected previously at the corner of Howard Street and Walnut Alley. It was a two cell affair constructed of stone; it stood to the rear of what became the Town Hall. The position of Bailiff remained a fixture in the Town through the late nineteenth century. The position was held by the following individuals: Charles Thompson, Frank Doyle, John Temple, Charlie Shears, John Bowman and Mack Bowman. The title of Bailiff evolved into that of Chief of Police. In a photograph dated “about 1900” John Temple is identified as Chief of Police. Appointed in 1919, James B. “Ben” Ray became one of the longest serving police chiefs in America, retiring in 1965. Ben was something of a character. In the 1950s and '60s it was not uncommon to see him “walking his beat” in uniform Bermuda shorts, knee high black socks and carrying a swagger stick. In 1936 the Town erected a stone building at the corner of W. Bel Air Avenue and Philadelphia Boulevard (Rt. 40), its original purpose was to serve as a comfort station for travelers. Apparently the Town fathers realized that the building was being under-utilized and moved the Town offices and the Police Department there. The old jail was abandoned in 1948 when new cell and court space was made available in the rear of the firehouse located at W. Bel Air Avenue and Parke Street. The Police Department took over the remainder of that building when the fire department constructed a larger facility at Rogers and Franklin Streets in 1973. Through the mid twentieth century the police department grew as the Towns population grew. During World War II the Department numbered three, by 1967 the Department numbered fifteen full-time officers and three part-time. The Chief of Police at that time was Chester Roberts. He was succeeded by William P. Krouse, a veteran of the Department for over twenty-five years. The next Chief was also a veteran officer, Arthur B. “Whitey” Elliott who served until August, 1981. By now the Department had grown to thirty-eight officers. Retired Maryland State Police Colonel Lemuel Porter took over and remained Chief until 1989. He was followed by John R. “Jack” Jolley, a retired US Army major and former Provost Marshal on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. During his term of office Aberdeen went from being a Town to becoming a City. Chief Jolley left the Department in December, 1994 and was succeeded by Michael Zotos, a retired Deputy Commissioner from the Baltimore City Police Department. Chief Zotos retired four years later in 1999. Retired MSP Captain Randy Rudy became Chief of the Department in February, 2000. During his tenure the Department moved into new facilities located in the north wing of City Hall. In 2006 the Department reached its largest authorized complement of 46 sworn officers; unfortunately, as a result of the Great Recession of 2008 budget cuts caused a reduction in force. Overview The Department is currently authorized 43 officers. In October, 2010 Chief Rudy retired from the agency. Captain Henry G. Trabert was appointed Chief, the first officer to rise through the ranks to that position since Arthur Elliott in the 1970s. The Aberdeen Police Department is a full service police agency. It consists of a Patrol Division staffed by 24 patrolmen and overseen by a lieutenant. The Criminal Investigation Division has three full-time investigators and a crime scene technician; three additional detectives (including a K-9) are assigned to the Special Operations Unit and are responsible for street level narcotics and vice investigations. A fourth detective is assigned full-time to the Harford County Task Force, a county wide multi-jurisdictional unit investigating mid- and upper level drug trafficking organizations. CID is supervised by a lieutenant. The Administrative lieutenant is responsible for procurement, quartermaster inventory, fleet maintenance, records management, police communications and numerous other related activities. He supervises and is assisted by an administrative sergeant, who oversees two School Resource officers and crossing guards and a civilian clerical supervisor. The Department also deploys a Special Weapons and Tactics Team, an Honor Guard and a Vehicle Accident Reconstruction Team. Under the Office of the Chief is a Deputy Chief, who is responsible for the day-today operations of the Department and a civilian CALEA manager. Lieutenant Kirk L. Bane was promoted to Captain and named the Deputy Chief of Police in July, 2014. And to think, it all started with a Town Bailiff.

Synopsis  The clever Fahri bin Abdillah goes on scholarship to Egypt to undertake study for a master's degree in Islam at Al-Azhar University, Cairo; his parents had to sell their rice field to help him as well. Fahri has a plan for his life to be achieved through his perseverance and discipline. He plans to marry when his thesis is accepted. He has yet to have a close relationship with a woman beyond what he had with his mother and grandmother. Maria Girgis is his first admirer: a Coptic Christian neighbor that, attracted to him for his knowledge of the Al Quran, admits it only in her diary. The Indonesian student Nurul did not recognize her attraction to Fahri. Nurul, a daughter of a well-regarded Muslim cleric in Indonesia, made Fahri think himself unworthy. The humble next door Egyptian neighbor, Noura, had empathy for Fahri since he got a scholarship but she romantically interpreted the feelings and this led to an accusation of rape. Aisha's beautiful eyes captured Fahri's heart and in the metro when Fahri defended Islam from being narrow-minded, Aisha fell in love with him. Before marriage, Fahri sought to satisfy the desire in his heart and follow his religious faith in pursuit of this relationship.

Index Mundi. Web. 30 October 2015. They generally have assigned roles in society and reduced rights compared to men. Study of women's rights in the country is made difficult by government censorship and lack of reliable, official data. Under Article 18 of the Constitution of Turkmenistan, women are guaranteed equal rights to men. In practice, however, they face routine political and societal discrimination. Women are not allowed to form independent women's organizations, and all such organizations must be registered under the Women's Union of Turkmenistan. They make up 16.8% of the country's Parliament. Most women work in the home, as mothers or homemakers, or in the markets as sellers. Though the country's Islamic roots are several centuries old, Turkmen women are not required to wear a face covering. Background Women in Turkmenistan Location of Turkmenistan Turkmenistan is a country in Central Asia. Throughout the centuries, the territory of present-day Turkmenistan has been subjected to numerous civilizations, such as Persian empires, the conquest of Alexander the Great, Muslims, Mongols, Turkic peoples, and Russians. Throughout most of the 20th century it was part of the Soviet Union, until its fall in 1991. As with other former Soviet states, in the 1990s the economy collapsed and the country experienced social problems. Today, Turkmenistan is about half urban and half rural; its population is largely Muslim (89%), but there is also a significant Eastern Orthodox minority. The total fertility rate is 2.09 children born/woman (2015 est.). During the Soviet period, women assumed responsibility for the observance of some Muslim rites to protect their husbands' careers. Many women entered the work force out of economic necessity, a factor that disrupted some traditional family practices and increased the incidence of divorce. At the same time, educated urban women entered professional services and careers. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, traditional values began to reassert themselves. This had led to increasing numbers of women confined to the home and dependent on their male counterparts.  Cultural role  Cooking is the main field of work for women. Some households have a small room for making food and keeping utensils. Neighbors or relatives sometimes arrive unasked to assist in housework, or they may bring their own household tasks to work on together and socialize. Food preparation is done in the open air. Tasks, such as smoking meat and popping corn, are done by men and often turn into a social opportunity.Genté, Régis. “Second-class citizens.” 17 June 2013. Chronicles of Turkmenistan. Web. 30 October 2015. Women are expected to maintain a distance from their male counterparts. Men and women might sit and eat in one place, but they are segregated during social occasions. Some women carry on the practice of wearing a yaşmak, head scarf, in the initial year after they are wed. The wife clenches the corner of her scarf in her teeth to show a significant barrier toward the male guests and to show respect to her parents-in-law. The scarf also stops her from communicating. The wife may stop covering her head with a yaşmak after a year of her wedding, after the birth of her first born, or by a decision within the family.Countries and their Cultures. “TÜrkmenistan.” 2015. Countries and their Cultures. Web. 30 October 2015.  Practices  = Clothing = Women are garbed in ankle-length garments of silk or velvet, which are commonly a mix of bright oranges, purples, yellows, blues, and greens. The necklines are embellished with elaborate gold-thread needlework that drops down, decorating the neckline right to the navel.Walker, Shaun. “Turkmenistan: Stranger in a very strange land.” 23 October 2011.

Garments prepared from ketene are worn by both men and women. Costumes made from ketene are used as a customary bridal dress. The embroidery on the garments reveal various patterns that are exclusively known as a family hallmark, distinguishing the family of its maker. Skilled Turkmen women use antique weaving looms known as tara, which were adopted in the ancient times.Traveler.uz. “Turkmen Silk.” 2008. Traveler.uz. Web. 30 October 2015. Turkmen teachers and healthcare workers are primarily women. Job cuts in both these sectors, however, have led to a dramatic rise in unemployment for both men and women. = Marriage = Article 25 of the Constitution of Turkmenistan requires mutual consent for marriage. Both individuals must also be above the age of 18. Arranged child marriages are common, typically between members of the same tribe. As with many Central Asian countries, bride abductions are a major occurrence in Turkmenistan. It is such a common practice that normal weddings are often accompanied with a mock bride abduction. Although abduction is de jure illegal, abductors are rarely prosecuted. Turkmen marriages feature numerous unique customs and rituals. Turkmen wedding dresses are often richly decorated and covered in silver-colored pendants which are believed to drive away evil spirits. = Violence against women = Turkmen women often face violence and subjugation. Police officers sometimes conduct forced gynecological examination of young girls to assess their virginity. If they are found to have had sex, the girl and her family are publicly humiliated and censured. Women are also often subject to domestic violence, and are usually hesitant to report abuse to authorities due to distrust and fear of retribution.  Political influence  Women comprise 16.8% of the Turkmen Parliament, and domestic law guarantees women the right to political participation. However, the actual participation of women in government is stifled by the curtailing of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).

He won a FA Cup winners medal in 1912 when Barnsley beat West Bromwich Albion in another replay after the first match ended goalless. The Manchester Guardian, when reporting on both 1912 matches, selected him as one of the better players on the pitch. Downs' career was broken by the first world war but he returned to Oakwell in 1919 and yet again proved an annoyance to West Bromwich Albion in 1920 when Barnsley knocked them out of the F A cup. By now Downs was thirty-three years of age and his performances in the cup alerted the top flight clubs that he was still good enough to play at the highest level. Downs had rejected many offers to step up during his career in the hope of gaining promotion with Barnsley but when Everton approached him after Barnsley's second round cup exit at the end of January 1920 he recognised it as his last chance and accepted a move to the First Division. Downs was an ever-present in his first full season at Goodison Park and went on to make ninety-two First Division appearances over five years but by 1923 he was finding it increasingly difficult to get into the first eleven and accepted an offer to step down into the third division with Brighton International career Downs' first season among the elite clubs was a success and brought him to the attention of the International selectors playing for England in a Home Championship game against Ireland on 23 October 1920 at Roker Park.

He became famous through a thesis he presented that was considered irreligious. Life Prades was born at Castelsarrasin, Tarn-et- Garonne. Having finished his preliminary studies, he went to Paris, where he lived in many seminaries, especially in that of St-Sulpice. He very soon became acquainted with the principal publishers of the Encyclopédie, and supplied them with the article on \\"Certitude\\". About the end of 1751, he presented himself for the doctorate, driven, as a mémoire of that time says, \\"by the incredulous, who, in order to justify his blasphemies, wanted to have his doctrine approved by the Faculty\\". Prades wrote a very long thesis, which the examiners accepted without reading. The defence, which took place on 18 November, was very sharp, and scandal broke out. On 15 December following, the Faculty declared several propositions to be \\"worthy of blame and censures\\". On 15 January following, the censure was published. According to Abbé de Prades, the soul is an unknown substance; sensations are the source of our ideas; the origin of civil law is might, from which are derived all notions of just and of unjust, of good and evil; natural law is empirical; revealed religion is only natural religion in its evolution; the chronology of the Pentateuch is false; the healings operated by Jesus Christ are doubtful miracles, since those operated by Esculapius present the same characteristics. The archbishop of Paris and several bishops approved the censure; afterwards, on the 2 March, Pope Benedict XIV condemned the thesis; at last the Parlement of Paris issued a decree against the author; further, Stanislas, Duke of Lorraine, incited the Faculty against the Abbé. Voltaire gave a detailed account of the events in his book \\"Le tombeau de la Sorbonne\\", published anonymously in 1753. Prades found a refuge in Holland, where he published his Apology (1752). Upon the recommendation of Voltaire and of the Marquis of Argens, the Abbé became lector to Frederick of Prussia and went to Berlin. Frederick gave him a pension and two canonries, the one at Oppeln, the other at Glogau. From the year 1753, negotiations were entered upon between the Abbé de Prades and the Bishop of Breslau, Philip von Schaffgotsch, with a view to a recantation. Frederick himself induced the Abbé to return to \\"the bosom of the Church\\". Benedict XIV and Cardinal Tencin wrote the formula of recantation which was signed by the Abbé. In 1754, the Faculty of Paris again inscribed the Abbé upon the list of bachelors. The Abbé de Prades became the archdeacon of the Chapter of Glogau, and died at Glogau in 1782.  Works  The Apology consists of two parts: a third part contained reflexions upon the Pastoral Letter of the bishop of Montauban and the Pastoral Instruction of the bishop of Auxerre as written by Diderot. Gabriel Brotier published the Survey of the Apology of the Abbé de Prades (1753). The question is whether the Abbé de Prades is not the author of an \\"Apology of the Abbé de Prades\\" in verse. Besides the works quoted, he left an Abrégé de l'histoire ecclésiastique de Fleury, tr. Berne (Berlin, 1767), II vols., with an anti-Catholic preface written by Frederick II. According to Quérard, he left in manuscript a complete translation of Tacitus, which remains unpublished. What has become of the manuscript is unknown. It is said also that he worked, before leaving France, at a Treatise on \\"the Truth of Religion\\".  Sources  * Francisque Bouillier, Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne, v. 2, Paris, C.

By \\"toughening\\" a polymer it is meant that the ability of the polymeric substance to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracture is increased. Considering the significant advantages in mechanical properties that rubber toughening offers, most major thermoplastics are available in rubber-toughened versions;\\"The Micromechanics of Rubber Toughening.\\" The Micromechanics of Rubber Toughening - Bucknall C. - 2011 - Makromolekulare Chemie.

N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2016. The effects of disperse rubber nanoparticles are complex and differ across amorphous and partly crystalline polymeric systems. Rubber particles toughen a system by a variety of mechanisms such as when particulates concentrate stress causing cavitation or initiation of dissipating crazes. However the effects are not one-sided; excess rubber content or debonding between the rubber and polymer can reduce toughness. It is difficult to state the specific effects of a given particle size or interfacial adhesion parameter due to numerous other confounding variables. The presence of a given failure mechanism is determined by many factors: those intrinsic to the continuous polymer phase, and those that are extrinsic, pertaining to the stress, loading speed, and ambient conditions. The action of a given mechanism in a toughened polymer can be studied with microscopy. The addition of rubbery domains occurs via processes such as melt blending in a Rheomix mixer and atom-transfer radical-polymerization. Current research focuses on how optimizing the secondary phase composition and dispersion affects mechanical properties of the blend. Questions of interest include those to do with fracture toughness, tensile strength, and glass transition temperature. Toughening Mechanisms Crazing in polymers This is a cartoon representation of failure mechanisms in 298x298px Different theories describe how a dispersed rubber phase toughens a polymeric substance; most employ methods of dissipating energy throughout the matrix. These theories include: microcrack theory, shear-yielding theory, multiple-crazing theory, shear band and crazing interaction theory, and more recently those including the effects of critical ligament thickness, critical plastic area, voiding and cavitation, damage competition and others. =Microcrack Theory= In 1956, the microcrack theory became the first to explain the toughening effect of a dispersed rubber phase in a polymer. Two key observations that went into the initial theory and subsequent expansion were as follows: (1) microcracks form voids over which styrene-butadiene copolymer fibrils form to prevent propagation, and (2) energy stored during elongation of toughened epoxies is released upon breaking of rubber particles. The theory concluded that the combined energy to initiate microcracks and the energy to break rubber particles could account for the increased energy absorption of toughened polymers. This theory was limited, only accounting for a small fraction of the observed increase in fracture energy. =Matrix Crazing= The matrix crazing theory focuses on explaining the toughening effects of crazing. Crazes start at the equator where principal strain is highest, propagate perpendicular to the stress, and end when they meet another particle. Crazes with perpendicular fibrils can eventually become a crack if the fibrils break. The volume expansion associated with small crazes distributed through a large volume compared to the small volume of a few large cracks in untoughened polymer accounts for a large fraction of the increase in fracture energy. Interaction between rubber particles and crazes puts elongation pressures onto the particles in the direction of stress. If this force overcomes the surface adhesion between the rubber and polymer, debonding will occur, thereby diminishing the toughening effect associated with crazing. If the particle is harder, it will be less able to deform, and thus debonding occurs under less stress. This is one reason why dispersed rubbers, below their own glass transition temperature, do not toughen plastics effectively. =Shear Yielding= Shear yielding theory is one that, like matrix crazing, can account for a large fraction of the increase in energy absorption of a toughened polymer. Evidence of shear yielding in a toughened polymer can be seen where there is \\"necking, drawing or orientation hardening.\\" Shear yielding will result if rubber particles act as stress concentrators and initiate volume-expansion through crazing, debonding and cavitation, to halt the formation of cracks. Overlapping stress fields from one particle to its neighbor will contribute to a growing shear-yielding region. The closer the particles are the more overlap and the larger shear-yielding region. Shear yielding is an energy absorbing process in itself, but furthermore initiation of shear bands also aids in craze arrest. The occurrence of cavitation is important to shear yielding theory because it acts to lower the yield stress. Cavitation precedes shear yielding, however shear yielding accounts for a much larger increase in toughness than does the cavitation itself. =Cavitation= Image shows a fractured surface with voiding.Cavitation is common in epoxy resins and other craze resistant toughened polymers, and is prerequisite to shearing in Izod impact strength testing. During the deformation and fracture of a toughened polymer, cavitation of the strained rubber particles occurs in crazing-prone and non-crazing-prone plastics, including, ABS, PVC, nylon, high impact polystyrene, and CTBN toughened epoxies. Engineers use an energy- balance approach to model how particle size and rubber modulus factors influence material toughness. Both particle size and modulus show positive correlation with brittle-tough transition temperatures. They are both shown to affect the cavitation process occurring at the crack tip process zone early in deformation, preceding large-scale crazing and shear yielding. In order to show increased toughness under strain, the volumetric strain must overcome the energy of void formation as modeled by the equation: U_r(r) = \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\pi R^3 K_r\\\\Biggl(\\\\Delta V_R - \\\\frac{r^3}{R^3}\\\\Biggl) + 4\\\\pi r^3\\\\Gamma + 2\\\\pi r^3 G_r F(\\\\lambda _\\\\gamma) \\"where G_r and K_r are the shear modulus and bulk modulus of the rubber, \\\\Delta V_R is the volume strain in the rubber particle, \\\\Gamma is the surface energy of the rubber phase, and the function F(\\\\lambda_\\\\gamma) is dependent on the failure strain of the rubber under biaxial stretching conditions.\\" The energy-balancing model applies the physical properties of the whole material to describe the microscopic behavior during triaxial stress. The volume stress and particle radius conditions for cavitation can be calculated, giving the theoretical minimum particle radius for cavitation, useful for practical applications in rubber toughening.Typically cavitation will occur when the average stress on the rubber particles is between 10 and 20 megapascal. The volume strain on the particle is relieved and voiding occurs. The energy absorption due to this increase in volume is theoretically negligible. Instead, it is the consequent shear band formation that accounts for increased toughness. Before debonding, as the strain increases, the rubber phases is forced to stretch further strengthening the matrix. Debonding between the matrix and the rubber reduces the toughness, creating the need for strong adhesion between the polymer and rubber phases. =Damage Competition Theory= The damage competition theory models the relative contributions of shear yielding and craze failure, when both are present. there are two main assumptions: crazing, microcracks, and cavitation dominate in brittle systems, and shearing dominates in the ductile systems. Systems that are in between brittle and ductile will show a combination of these. The damage competition theory defines the brittle- ductile transition as the point at which the opposite mechanism (shear or yield damage) appears in a system dominated by the other mechanism. =Characterization of Failure= The dominant failure mechanism can usually be observed directly using TEM, SEM and light microscopy. If cavitation or crazing is dominant, tensile dilatometry (see dilatometer) can be used to measure the extent of the mechanism by measuring volume strain. However, if multiple dilatational mechanisms are present, it is difficult to measure the separate contributions. Shear yielding is a constant volume process and cannot be measured with tensile dilatometry. Voiding can be seen with optical microscopy, however one of two methods, using polarized light or low angle light scattering are necessary to observe the connection between cavitation and shear bands. Characteristics of the continuous phase relevant to toughening theory In order to gauge the toughening effects of a dispersed secondary phase, it is important to understand the relevant characteristics of the continuous polymer phase. The mechanical failure characteristics of the pure polymeric continuous phase will strongly influence how rubber toughened polymer failure occurs. When a polymer usually fails due to crazing, rubber toughening particles will act as craze initiators. When it fails by shear yielding, the rubber particles will initiate shear bands. It is also possible to having multiple mechanisms come into play if the polymer is prone to failing by multiple stresses equally. Polystyrene and styrene-acrylonitrile are brittle materials that are prone to craze failure while polycarbonate, polyamides, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are prone to shear yield failure. =Glass Transition Temperature= Amorphous plastics are used below their glass transition temperature (T_g). They are brittle and notch sensitive but creep resistant. Molecules are immobile and the plastic responds to rapidly applied stress by fracturing. Partly crystalline thermoplastics are used for application in temperature conditions between T_g and T_m (melting temperature). Partly crystalline thermoplastics are tough and creep-prone because the amorphous regions surrounding the rigid crystals are afforded some mobility. Often they are brittle at room temperature because they have high glass transition temperatures. Polyethylene is tough at room temperature because it’s T_g is lower than room temperature. Polyamide 66 and polyvinylchloride have secondary transitions below their T_g that allows for some energy absorbing molecule mobility. =Chemical Structure= There are some general guidelines to follow when trying to determine a plastic's toughness from its chemical structure. Vinyl polymers like polystyrene and styrene-acrylonitrile tend to fail by crazing. They have low crack initiation and propagation energies. Polymers with aromatic backbones, such as polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate, tend to fail by shear yielding with high crack initiation energy but low propagation energy. Other polymers, including poly(methyl methacrylate) and polyacetal(polyoxymethylene), are not as brittle as \\"brittle polymers\\" and are also not as ductile as \\"ductile polymers\\". =Entanglement density and flexibility of unperturbed real chain= The following equations relate the entanglement density v_e and a measure of the flexibility of the unperturbed real chain (C_\\\\infty) of a given plastic to its fracture mechanics: V_e = \\\\frac {\\\\rho_a}{3 M_v C_\\\\infty ^2} Where \\\\rho_ais the mass density of the amorphous polymer, and M_v is the average molecular weight per statistical unit. Crazing stress (\\\\sigma_z) is related to the entanglement density by: \\\\sigma_z \\\\varpropto v_e ^{1/2} The normalized stress yield is related to C_\\\\infty by log(\\\\overline{\\\\sigma}_y) \\\\varpropto log(C_\\\\infty) + c c is a constant. The ratio of the crazing stress to the normalized stress yield is used to determine whether a polymer will fail due to crazing or yield: \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_z}{\\\\overline{\\\\sigma}_y} \\\\propto \\\\biggl( \\\\frac{\\\\rho_a} {3M_v}\\\\biggr)^{1/2}C_\\\\infty ^ {-2} When the ratio is higher, the matrix is prone to yielding; when the ratio is lower, the matrix is prone to failure by crazing. These formulas form the base of crazing theory, shear-yielding theory, and damage competition theory. Relationship between the secondary phase properties and toughening effect =Rubber selection and miscibility with continuous phase= In material selection it is important to look at the interaction between the matrix and the secondary phase. For example, crosslinking within the rubber phase will promote high strength fibril formation that will toughen the rubber, preventing particle fracture. Carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile (CTBN) is often used to toughen epoxies, but using CTBN alone increases the toughness at the cost of stiffness and heat resistance. Amine-terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (ATBN) is also used. Using ultra-fine full-vulcanized powdered rubber (UFPR) researchers have been able to improve all three, toughness, stiffness, and heat resistance simultaneously, resetting the stage for rubber toughening with particles smaller than previously thought to be effective. In applications where high optical transparency is necessary, examples being poly(methyl methacrylate) and polycarbonate it is important to find a secondary phase that does not scatter light. To do so it is important to match refractive indices of both phases. Traditional rubber particles do not offer this quality. Modifying the surface of nanoparticles with polymers of comparable refractive indices is an interest of current research. =Secondary phase concentration= 232x232pxIncreasing the rubber concentration in a nanocomposite decreases the modulus and tensile strength. In one study, looking at PA6-EPDM blend, increasing the concentration of rubber up to 30 percent showed a negative linear relationship with the brittle-tough transition temperature, after which the toughness decreased. This suggests that the toughening effect of adding rubber particles is limited to a critical concentration. This is examined further in a study on PMMA from 1998; using SAXS to analyze crazing density, it was found that crazing density increases and yield stress decreases until the critical point when the relationship flips. =Rubber particle size= A material that is expected to fail by crazing is more likely to benefit from larger particles than a shear prone material, which would benefit from a smaller particle. In materials where crazing and yielding are comparable, a bimodal distribution of particle size may be useful for toughening. At fixed rubber concentrations, one can find that an optimal particle size is a function of the entanglement density of the polymer matrix. The neat polymer entanglement densities of PS, SAN, and PMMA are 0.056, 0.093, and 0.127 respectively. As entanglement density increases, the optimum particle size decreases linearly, ranging between 0.1 and 3 micrometers. The effect of particle size on toughening is dependent on the type of test performed. This can be explained because for different test conditions, the failure mechanism changes. For impact strength testing on PMMA where failure occurs by shear-yielding, the optimum size of filler PBA-core PMMA-shell particle was shown in one case to be 250 nm. In the three-point bend test, where failure is due to crazing, 2000 nm particles had the most significant toughening effect. =Temperature effects= Temperature has a direct effect on the fracture mechanics. At low temperatures, below the glass transition temperature of the rubber, the dispersed phase behaves like a glass rather than like a rubber that toughens the polymer. As a result, the continuous phase will fail by mechanisms characteristic of the pure polymer, as if the rubber was not present. As temperature increases past the glass transition temperature, the rubber phase will increase the crack initiation energy. At this point the crack self-propagates due to the stored elastic energy in the material. As temperature rises further past the glass transition of the rubber phase, the impact strength of a rubber-polymer composite still dramatically increases as crack propagation requires additional energy input. Sample Applications of Rubber Toughening =Epoxy resins= Epoxy resins are a highly useful class of materials used in engineering applications. Some of these include use for adhesives, fiber-reinforced composites, and electronics coatings. Their rigidity and low crack propagation resistance makes epoxies a candidate of interest for rubber toughening research to fine- tune the toughening processes. Some of the factors affecting the toughness of epoxy nanocomposites include the chemical identity of the epoxy curing agent, entanglement density, and interfacial adhesion. Curing epoxy 618 with piperidine, for example, produces tougher epoxies than when boron trifluoride- ethylamine is used. Low entanglement density increases the toughness. Bisphenol A can be added to lower the crosslinking density of epoxy 618, thereby increasing the fracture toughness. Bisphenol A and a rubber filler increase toughness synergistically. In textbooks and literature before 2002 it was assumed that there is a lower limit for rubber-toughening particle diameter at 200 nm; it was then discovered that ultra-fine full-vulcanized powdered rubber particles with diameter of 90 nm show significant toughening of rubber epoxies. This finding underlines how this field is constantly growing and more work can be done to better model the rubber toughening effect. =ABS= Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer is an application of rubber toughening. The properties of this polymer come mainly from rubber toughening. The polybutadiene rubber domains in the main styrene- acrylonitrile matrix act as a stop to crack propagation. =Optically Transparent Plastics= PMMA’s high optical transparency, low cost, and compressibility make it a viable option for practical applications in architecture and car manufacturing as a substitute for glass when high transparency is necessary. Incorporating a rubber filler phase increases the toughness. Such fillers need to form strong interfacial bonds with the PMMA matrix. In applications where optical transparency is important, measures must be taken to limit light scattering. It is common in toughening PMMA, and in other composites, to synthesize core-shell particles via atom-transfer radical-polymerization that have an outer polymer layer that has properties similar to those of the primary phase that increases the particle’s adhesion to the matrix. Developing PMMA compatible core-shell particles with low glass transition temperature while maintaining optical transparency is of interest to architects and car companies. For optimal transparency the disperse rubber phase needs the following: * Small average particle radius * Narrow particle size distribution * Refractive index matching that of matrix across range of temperatures and wavelengths * Strong adhesion to matrix * Similar viscosity to matrix at processing temperature Cyclic olefin copolymer, an optically transparent plastic with low moisture uptake and solvent resistance among other useful properties, can be toughened effectively with a styrene- butadiene-styrene rubber with the above properties. The Notched-Izod strength more than doubled from 21 J/m to 57 J/m with an optical haze of 5%. =Improving polystyrene= Polystyrene generally has stiffness, transparency, processibility, and dielectric qualities that make it useful. However, its low impact resistance at low temperatures makes catastrophic fracture failure when cold more likely. The most widely used version of toughened polystyrene is called high impact polystyrene or HIPS. Being cheap and easy to thermoform (see thermoforming), it is utilized for many everyday uses. HIPS is made by polymerizing styrene in a polybutadiene rubber solution. After the polymerization reaction begins, the polystyrene and rubber phases separate. When phase separation begins, the two phases compete for volume until phase inversion occurs and the rubber can distribute throughout the matrix. The alternative emulsion polymerization with styrene-butadiene-styrene or styrene- butadiene copolymers allows fine-tuned manipulation of particle size distribution. This method makes use of the core-shell architecture. In order to study the fracture microstructure of HIPS in a transmission electron microscope it is necessary to stain one of the phases with a heavy metal, Osmium tetroxide for example. This produces substantially different electron density between phases. Given a constant particle size, it is the cross- linking density that determines the toughness of a HIPS material. This can be measured by exploiting the negative relationship between the cis-polybutadiene content of the rubber and the crosslink density that can be measured with the swelling index. Lower crosslink density leads to increased toughness. The generation of vast quantities of waste rubber from car tires has sparked interest in finding uses for this discarded rubber. The rubber can be turned into a fine powder, which can then be used as a toughening agent for polystyrene. However, poor miscibility between the waste rubber and polystyrene will weaken the material. This problem requires the use of a compatibilizer (see compatibilization) in order to reduce interfacial tension and ultimately make rubber toughening of polystyrene effective. A polystyrene/styrene-butadiene copolymer acts to increase the adhesion between the dispersed and continuous phases.

In some cases specific micro-nutrients may be required to allow the available nutrients to be fully utilised by living organisms. In other cases, the presence of specific chemical species may produce toxic effects limiting growth and abundance of living matter.Metcalf & Eddy pp.256-258&492 =Metals= Many dissolved or suspended metal salts exert harmful effects in the environment sometimes at very low concentrations. Some aquatic plants are able to remove very low metal concentrations, with the metals ending up bound to clay or other mineral particles. Organisms Saprophytic bacteria and fungi can convert organic matter into living cell mass, carbon dioxide, water and a range of metabolic by-products. These saprophytic organisms may then be predated upon by protozoa, rotifers and, in cleaner waters, Bryozoa which consume suspended organic particles including viruses and pathogenic bacteria. Clarity of the water may begin to improve as the protozoa are subsequently consumed by rotifers and cladocera.Metcalf & Eddy pp.380&381 Purifying bacteria, protozoa, and rotifers must either be mixed throughout the water or have the water circulated past them to be effective. Sewage treatment plants mix these organisms as activated sludge or circulate water past organisms living on trickling filters or rotating biological contactors.Fair, Geyer & Okun pp.32-12,32-31&34-2 Aquatic vegetation may provide similar surface habitat for purifying bacteria, protozoa, and rotifers in a pond or marsh setting; although water circulation is often less effective. Plants and algae have the additional advantage of removing nutrients from the water; but some of those nutrients will be returned to the water when the plants die unless the plants are removed from the water. Because of the complex chemistry of Phosphorus much of this element is in an unavailable form unless decomposition creates anoxic conditions which render the phosphorus available for re-uptake. Plants also provide shade, a refuge for fish, and oxygen for aerobic bacteria. In addition, fish can limit pests such as mosquitoes. Fish and waterfowl feces return waste to the water, and their feeding habits may increase turbidity. Cyanobacteria have the disadvantageous ability to add nutrients from the air to the water being purified and to generate toxins in some cases. The choice of organism depends on the local climate different species and other factors. Indigenous species usually tend to be better adapted to the local environment. =Macrophytes= A water-purifying plant (Iris pseudacorus) in growth after winter (leaves die at that time of year) The choice of plants in engineered wet-lands or managed lagoons is dependent on the purification requirements of the system and this may involve plantings of varying plant species at a range of depths to achieve the required goal. Plants purify water by consuming excess nutrients and by providing surfaces upon which a wide range of other purifying organisms can live. They also are effective oxygenators in sunlight. They also have the ability to translocate chemicals between their submerged foliage and their root systems and this is of significance in engineered wet- lands designed to de-toxify waste waters. Plants that have been used in temperate climates include Nymphea alba, Phragmites australis, Sparganium erectum, Iris pseudacorus, Schoenoplectus lacustris and Carex acutiformis. Where oxygenation is a critical requirement Stratiotes aloides, Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, Acorus calamus, Myriophyllum species and Elodea have been used. Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Nuphar lutea have been used where shade and cover are required =Fish= Fish are frequently the top level predators in a managed treatment eco-system and in some case may simply be a mono-culture of herbivorous species. Management of multi-species fisheries requires careful management and may involve a range of fish species including bottom-feeders and predatory species to limit population growth of the herbivorous fish =Rotifers= Rotifers are microscopic complex organisms and are filter feeders removing fine particulate matter from water. They occur naturally in aerobic lagoons, activated sludge processes, in trickling filters and in final settlement tanks and are a significant factor in removing suspended bacterial cells and algae from the water column. =Annelids= Annelid worms are essential to the effective operation of trickling filters helping to remove excess bio-mass and enhancing natural sloughing of the bio-film. Supernumerary worms are very commonly found in the drainage troughs around trickling filters and in the final settlement sludge. Annelids also play a key role in lagoon treatment systems and in the effective working or engineered wet-lands. In this environment worms are a principal force in mixing in the upper few centimetres of the sediment layer exposing organic material to both oxidative and anoxic environments aiding the complete breakdown of most organics. They are also a key ingredient in the food-chain transferring energy upwards to fish and aquatic birds. =Protozoa= The range of protozoan species found is very wide but may include species of the following genera: * AmoebaFair, Geyer & Okun p.34-8 * Arcella * BlepharismaHammer pp.54&61 * Didinium * Euglena * Hypotrich * Paramecium * SuctoriaMetcalf & Eddy p.381 * Stylonychia * Vorticella =Insects= * Chironomidae bloodworm larva * Podura aquatica water springtail * Psychodidae drain fly or filter fly larva See also * Aquatic plant * Water purification * Treatment pond Sources * Fair, Gordon Maskew, Geyer, John Charles & Okun, Daniel Alexander Water and Wastewater Engineering (Volume 2) John Wiley & Sons (1968) * Hammer, Mark J.

It was jointly owned and operated by Manchester and Liverpool universities and used for performing neutron activation work and training reactor operators.  Design  The reactor used highly enriched uranium metal fuel clad in aluminium. The fuel elements consisted of bundles of flat plates rather than rods. The core was cooled by light water. The fuel elements were situated within six open-topped aluminium tanks containing water that were separated and surrounded by graphite. This meant that moderation was part by the water within the tanks and part by graphite - with graphite serving as the reflector. Reactivity control was provided by four semaphore signal–type control blades held by magnetic clutches to shafts that could be driven by geared electric motors. The blades were made of cadmium plates riveted to aluminium blades. The insertion of a single blade was sufficient to shut down the fission chain reaction. The simple control system did not use voting logic. Any detected fault resulted in an immediate scram. Power failure also produced an immediate scram as the magnetic clutches on the control blades would disengage, certain control instrumentation had battery back up support. The heat generated by fission was carried away by the cooling water and disposed of outside the facility by means of a forced-draft cooling radiator. Due to the small size of the core and low burn up of the fuel, the disposal of fission product heating was not an issue. The concrete shielding was penetrated by a number of holes enabling neutron beams to be obtained for the purpose of irradiating samples and several pipes that enabled samples in sample carriers to be inserted into the reactor and subsequently removed to the adjoining radiochemical laboratory for study.  Operations  The construction works started in 1962 and went critical on 7 July 1964. In later years the reactor was rated at 300 kW thermal however originally the output was 100 kW thermal. A study was undertaken (around 1980) to investigate increasing the power to 1 MW thermal; however, this was deemed to be too difficult and the plans were abandoned.  Decommissioning  Decommissioning work began in 1992 and was finished in 2006. The reactor fuel being reprocessed. The nuclear waste produced during the dismantling operations was moved to Sellafield for permanent storage.

This led to an entire movement of 20th Century poetry being called 'Confessional poetry'. The review was published in The Nation on 19 September 1959, and was later collected in Rosenthal's book of selected essays and reviews, Our Life In Poetry (1991).Rosenthal, Our Life in Poetry pages 109 - 112 Some material from the essay was used in an essay Rosenthal published the following year in his book The Modern Poets: A Critical Introduction.Rosenthal, M. L., The Modern Poets: A Critical Introduction New York: Oxford University Press, 1960 The review opens with a reference to Emily Dickinson and noting the new trend towards confession in poetry: Rosenthal proceeds to compare the current day approach with that of the poets of the Romantic period such as John Keats. The Romantics, he asserts, found \\"cosmic equations and symbols\\". Keats transcended his \\"personal complaint\\", and lost it in the \\"music of universal folornness\\". Rosenthal introduces the adjective \\"confessional\\" when hew moves on to Walt Whitman and his Calamus poems: T. S.

A Polish independence activist and insurgent, he took part in the independence struggles of Poles and Hungarians against the Austrian-Russian alliance. He converted to Islam in 1844 and subsequently served in various commanding posts in the Ottoman Army during the reign of Abdulmejid I (1839–1861) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Danube, Crimea, Transcaucasia, and Baghdad. He was promoted to the rank of Pasha (General) during the Crimean War in 1855. Early life and conversion to Islam Antoni Aleksander Iliński was born in the town of Žilina (Ilina), in Hungary. In 1830, he took part in the November Uprising as a young officer of the Lithuanian Legion. He was an active member of the movement of Polish exiles led by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski from Paris. Iliński worked under the leadership of Józef Bem in his abortive Portuguese Legion attempt (1833), and in further struggles to form Polish legions in Spain, France and elsewhere. In 1844 he was arrested in Constantinople upon Russian request, for allegedly working to organise Ukrainian Cossack legions under Michał Czajkowski's \\"Eastern Agency\\". The Ottoman authorities were indifferent, but Russia pressured for his handover for trial. To escape this trap, he consented to an offer to convert to Islam and assumed Ottoman nationality under the new name of Mehmed Iskender. He was immediately accepted as a lieutenant colonel in the Ottoman Army as \\"Iskender Beg\\". In the years 1848–49, during the time of Spring of Nations, he was again Bem's aide in Hungary.  In the Ottoman Army  He served in the Army of Roumelia under Omar Pasha. He was a prominent figure in the military campaign that deposed and eventually executed the Herzegovina Vizier Ali-paša Rizvanbegović in 1851. When the Crimean War broke out in 1853, he was charged with organizing and training the irregular troops (the bashi-bazouks) along the Danube. In the following year, Iskender Pasha's fierce and daring style in commanding successful cavalry raids on Russians brought him acclaim and he was soon promoted as colonel. Early 1855 he was posted in the Yevpatoria Garrison in Crimea commanding a 400-strong cavalry regiment. His unit made a critical contribution in successfully repulsing a strong Russian assault on the town, which was threatening the rear of the Allied army besieging Sebastopol (see:Battle of Eupatoria) This victory brought him a second promotion in a year, making him a Pasha (general), (specifically a Mirliva, equivalent of a brigadier general). The same year he commanded the advance guard of an expedition army under Omar Pasha which landed at Sukhumi, in the hope of relieving the Eastern Anatolian fortress- city Kars from a Russian siege (see: Siege of Kars). The city fell to the Russians, however, before the two armies could engage. In 1857 he was again called to duty by Omar Pasha, who was appointed as the Governor and General Commander of Baghdad. He went to Baghdad and was active in the repression of tribal uprisings around Basra and in the Nejd area. On his return to Constantinople in 1861, he fell suddenly ill after an official banquet and died on 2 June 1861. He was buried in Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery in Constantinople.

The initial meeting included delegates from thirty-two national Jewish organizations. It was called to decide upon the role that the American Jewish community would play in representing Jewish demands after the war and helping to build Jewish Palestine.Tivnan, p.23 The result was the creation of the American Jewish Conference, which consisted of sixty-four Jewish groups, including American Jewish Committee; it constituted the most representative gathering of American Jews ever. At the first meeting, moderate American Zionists including Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise, were eager to concentrate on supporting Zionism through philanthropy and play down the \\"maximalist\\" goal of a “Jewish commonwealth.” Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver, representing the maximalists, called for the delegates to endorse the Biltmore Program. Silver's followers characterized the contrast between the two as \\"Aggressive Zionism\\" versus \\"the Politics of the Green Light [from the White House].\\"Abba Hillel Silver He also attacked Wise’s views, which upset the delegates from the American Jewish Committee, and caused them to walk out. The conference proceeded and sided with Silver and he emerged from the meeting as the new leader of American Zionism.

Origins In Britain, but especially London, during the 1970s and the 1980s the teaching and playing of cricket was dying in schools funded by the state, for many complex reasons and by 1990 only 20 out of more than 800 such schools in London were playing the game. The teaching of cricket has declined throughout England in recent years, but the issue is compounded in London as there are few local teams with their own grounds on which children can be taught. To counter this lack of interest, CKC was set up by two Yorkshiremen William Greaves and Hayden Turner, who have a passion for cricket, and were concerned at its decline. Position today Now more than half the schools in London teach cricket, and promote the ethos that the game has traditionally provided. Volunteers have been found to help develop the sport in schools, and annual competitions have been arranged with the winners playing their final at the MCC Indoor School at Lord's Cricket Ground. Support The charity is sponsored both corporately and individually, and especially with the help of active and retired cricketers. The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, Lord's Taverners, British Land plc, Sportsmatch and the MCC support in various ways. Individuals are invited to join the Heavy Rollers, a little joke suggesting that they possess money and propel the heavy roller used to flatten the cricket wicket. The Heavy Rollers are led by Head Groundsman, Clive Lloyd, the ex-West Indies captain and assistant head groundsmen, who are senior cricketers such as Mike Brearley, Roland Butcher, Donald Carr, Mike Denness, Ted Dexter, Paul Downton, John Edrich, Keith Fletcher, Angus Fraser, Mike Gatting, Graham Gooch, David Gower, Tom Graveney, Tony Lewis, Brian Luckhurst, Alec Stewart, Bob Willis and Don Wilson. Others can join on the payment of a small contribution. 20th anniversary In 2010 the charity celebrated its 20th anniversary. At a well attended bash at the HQ of Westminster City Council, a celebration was held, attended by seven mayors of London Boroughs wearing their insignias of office – their mayoral chains – who informally and affectionately refer to themselves as the chain gang.

Later on he had a few other experiences at the helm of amateur teams Potenza, Maglie, and Vittoria, where he won the Serie C2 playoffs in 2004 and headed the Sicilian team during the first five weeks of the following season, in Serie C1. He then returned at Reggina, where he served as youth team coach, and then as club scout for Latin America. On March 3, 2008, he was appointed to replace Renzo Ulivieri at the helm of Reggina's first team. During his stint as first team coach, results dramatically improved and Reggina managed to mathematically save themselves from relegation in advance of one week. He was confirmed at the helm of Reggina for the 2008–09 season. In his second season as Reggina coach, the team struggled to achieve positive results, and this ultimately led to Orlandi being dismissed from his post on December 16, two days after a home 0–2 loss to Sampdoria, leaving the team in second-last place with 12 points achieved in 16 games. He was replaced by Giuseppe Pillon. On January 25, 2009, he was reinstated back at the helm of the amaranto following the club's decision to dismiss Pillon due to poor results, but did not manage to save his club from relegation and left the club later in June. He returned into management in 2013 as head coach of Barletta from March 2013 to April 2014. He then served as Grosseto head coach in the Serie D league from February to June 2016, before taking over at Chieti that same year in July. However, on January 2017 he found himself without a team after Chieti was excluded from the Serie D league due to financial issues. On 17 November 2017, he was named head coach of Serie D club Vibonese, guiding the club to promotion in the 2017–18 Serie D season, and a mid-table placement in the subsequent 2018–19 Serie C campaign.

Although Abraham's forefathers were from southern Mesopotamia (in present-day IraqAbraham, Wigoder, Geoffrey. Illustrated Dictionary and Concordance of the Bible. 1986. The Jerusalem Publishing House. , pp. 22-23) according to the biblical narrative, Yahweh led Abraham on a journey to the land of Canaan, which he promised to his children. Source criticism The genealogy of Abraham appears in Genesis 5, Genesis 10:1-7, 20, 22-23, 31-32, and Genesis 11. The documentary hypothesis attributes these genealogies to the Priestly source.Coogan, Michael D. (2014). The Old Testament: A Historical and Literary Introduction to Hebrew Scriptures. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 62-64. Biblical narrative Abram and Sarah prospered materially but had no children. Abram thought to leave his estate to a trusted servant, but God promised him a son and heir. When he was 86 years old, Sarah suggested and Abram agreed that a practical way to have a child was through Sarah’s servant Hagar. Hagar conceived right away and in time Ishmael was born. This situation brought strife rather than happiness between Hagar and Sarah. Nevertheless, God saw Hagar’s suffering and promised that although this was not the child promised to Abram, he would nevertheless make Ishmael’s descendants into a great nation also.Ishmael, in Freeman, David Noel. The Anchor Bible Dictionary Volume 2 H-J. 1992. Doubleday Publishing Group. , pp. 513-514 In Genesis chapter 17 \\"Almighty God\\" changed Abram’s name to Abraham, for he would be a father of many nations. And his wife Sarah's name was called Sarah, for she would be a mother of nations. Three visitors came to Abraham and said that he would have a son. Sarah believed she was too old to have a child and laughed. Yet she did conceive (Genesis 21:1-7) and had a baby named Isaac. After the death of his mother, Sarah, Isaac married Rebekah. Abraham then married Keturah, who bore him six more sons – Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. =Family tree= The following is a family tree for the descendants of the line of Noah's son Shem, through Abraham to Jacob and his sons.

It was established in Nagpur in 1958 with focus on water supply, sewage disposal, communicable diseases and to some extent on industrial pollution and occupational diseases found common in post-independent India. NEERI is a pioneer laboratory in the field of environmental science and engineering and part of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). NEERI has five zonal laboratories at Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai. NEERI falls under the Ministry of Science and Technology (India) of central government.:: National Environmental Engineering Research Institute :: The NEERI is an important partner organisation in India's POPs national implementation plan (NIP).https://chemicalwatch.com/60970/india-to-act-on- seven-pops-by-mid-2018 The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur was established in 1958 as Central Public Health Engineering Research Institute (CPHERI), when environmental concerns were limited to human health with a focus on water supply/sewage disposal/ communicable diseases and to some extent on industrial pollution and occupational diseases. The chemical and biological solutions to address these problems were simple, though challenging. However, slowly worldwide public awareness on the contamination of the environment on regional to global scale started getting attention in 1970's. Shrimati Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, rechristened the Institute as National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in the year 1974. National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur is devoted to research and innovations in environmental science and engineering besides solving a range of problems posed by industry, government and public. Vision, Mission and Mandate NEERI states its mandate as: *To conduct research and developmental studies in environmental science and engineering. *To render assistance to the industries of the region, local bodies, etc. in solving the problems of environmental pollution. *To interact and collaborate with academic and research institutions on environmental science and engineering for mutual benefit. *To participate in CSIR thrust area and mission projects  The beginning  The journey started in 1958 when a serious water pollution episode confronted the country's capital city, Delhi. An organization was necessary that could assess and counter any issue in the public health domain. Thus was created the Central Public Health Engineering Research Institute (CPHERI). CPHERI was established on 8 April 1958 by Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) to initially deal with problems of water and air pollution in urban settlements to assist industry, to anticipate problems, provide solutions and to concentrate on regional development. The Institute subsequently provided excellent services to the society in the domain of public health by carrying out various important activities in the areas of water and air environment. That time environmental concerns were limited to human health with a focus on water supply, sewage disposal and communicable diseases. Later on, worldwide public awareness on the environmental degradation started getting attention. After participating in the \\"United Nations Inter-Governmental Conference on Human Environment\\" at Stockholm in 1972, which gave legitimacy to environmental issues, the then Prime Minister of India and President, CSIR, Smt. Indira Gandhi renamed the Central Public Health Engineering Research as the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in 1974. This was done to encompass the entire vistas of R&D; in the area of environmental science and engineering. Accordingly, the Institute, in line with the vision, mission and policy of CSIR, delineated thrust areas for R&D; comprising Environmental Monitoring, Environmental Biotechnology, Solid & Hazardous Waste Management, Environmental Systems Design Modelling and Optimization, Environmental Impact & Risk Assessment, and Environmental Policy Analysis. Presently, CSIR-NEERI is functioning with headquarters at Nagpur and five Zonal Laboratories located at Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad.  Glorious decades  Between sixties and late seventies, to ensure potable water to communities, NEERI paid special attention to cost-effective process development. The processes for defluoridation, removal of heavy metals and salts, and destruction of microbial organisms were developed by the scientists. ‘Chlorine tablets’ and ‘Nalgonda technique for defluoridation of water’ developed by the Institute proved to be the major achievements of the Institute in the interest of society. The Institute also helped in designing water treatment plants, involving the application of slow sand filtration and use of membranes. Analytical procedures for rapid and accurate estimation of quality of water were developed and these are now widely in use. Water being an important resource for all life processes and for industry, specific technologies were developed for treatment of industrial wastewaters as well as domestic effluents. Recycling, therefore, has been a very significant area of R&D; at the Institute for water management, since wastewater after treatment can be used in agriculture. Between the mid-eighties and the late nineties, the Institute saw a phenomenal growth in its activities, swelling number of projects and a concomitant overall growth of in-house infrastructure facilities including analytical Instruments. The Institute earned recognition from various International bodies, such as World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as Centre of Reference for environmental science and technologies. CSIR-NEERI's efforts to combat and mitigate environment degrading activities ranged from development of technologies to cater to the marginal and grass root population through comprehensive \\"Environmental Impact and Risk Assessment (EIRA)\\" for industrial, commercial, societal activities of any scale to the development of \\"Toxic and Hazardous Waste Management Systems\\" for the chemical and allied industries. While the Institute has played a major role in process / system development for environment management, CSIR-NEERI has provided inputs to the development of environmental statutes such as \\"Environment Protection Act\\" and \\"Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules\\". This was a beginning, where CSIR-NEERI's expertise was developed to give the society solutions to existing problems. From 1990, environmental biotechnology and genomics have emerged as useful tools for sustainable development. The Institute now deals with micro-niches, in which ‘how the DNA structure can be used as a tool to analyse and provide solutions to environmental pollution problems’ is studied. From a microscopic organism to impact assessment of the mega projects like Sethusamudram, the Institute covers all aspects of R&D; in environmental science and engineering. The Institute now houses a bacterial culture bank of 1200 bacteria that have been identified sequencing the 16S rRNA genes. These are used in bioremediation as well as in bio-prospecting, The Institute has demonstrated rejuvenation of mine spoil dumpsites and continue to develop additional expertise through an integrated biotechnological approach for detoxification of degraded lands. The technology for solidification / stabilization and immobilization of arsenic bearing hazardous wastes was implemented in Zuari Industries Ltd., Goa. The Institute was involved in providing solutions to some of the pollution problems due to industrial and municipal wastewater discharge in places such as Delhi and Tirupur. The Institute is also involved in the development of analytical protocols for some of the emerging pollutants like dioxins and furans, mercury, trace contaminants besides routine analytical services in environmental monitoring. On the societal front, the Institute offered its services during environmental crises, for example, it has provided drinking water in the areas affected by floods in Rajasthan as well as hilly regions of the country and safe drinking water in fluoride affected areas. While the Institute started its journey primarily to address issues related to water pollution, later entries in to air and land made it encompass all the major domains of environment. Over the years the major activities of the Institute in these domains included master plan for the treatment and disposal of sewage in Bombay, water quality assessment for the Hooghly estuary, Indo-US project on treatment and disposal of wastes from phosphatic fertilizer plants and basic organic chemical manufacturing units, Ganga Action Plan, environmental impact and risk assessment for industrial / commercial / societal activities of any scale, assessment of water quality for drinking water supply in various parts of the country, municipal refuse management in various cities and municipalities in the country, solid and hazardous waste management in various chemical / metallurgical industries, recycle / reuse of wastes, ecological rejuvenation of mined areas in various parts of the country, environmental biotechnology and genomics, environmental materials development and assessment and mitigation of environmental damage caused to national monuments such as Taj Mahal. At present, the focus of the Institute is developing end to end environmental solutions and keep the focus of CSIR NEERI as a place for \\"Society driven Solution\\" through use of Science and Engineering and cost- effective and resource recovery-based technologies suitable to socio-economic conditions prevailing in the country. The Institute initiated various R&D; activities for effective environmental monitoring in the country. The Institute has been involved in monitoring of pesticide residues at national level. The Institute also initiated various R&D; projects towards waste to wealth, clean potable water and clean air under CSIR-800 programme. CSIR-NEERI was nominated as ‘Stockholm Convention Regional Centre on Persistent Organic Pollutants for Asia Region’ in September 2010 and has been endorsed as the ‘Regional Centre for Capacity Building and Technology Transfer’ at COP-5 Meeting held at Geneva. This centre aims to conduct research and development studies in the area of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and new POPs along with special focus to promote their environmentally sound management, capacity building and awareness raising campaigns in the region. The Institute has witnessed various major achievements in its R&D; thrust areas in the last decades.  R&D; thrust areas  = Environmental monitoring = One of the most significant R&D; thrust areas of CSIR-NEERI is environmental monitoring. The Institute is operating a nation-wide air quality monitoring network since 1978. The programme sponsored by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) since 1990 has generated a time series data on air quality for ten major Indian cities – Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kanpur, Kochi, Mumbai and Nagpur. The Institute has developed an extensive database for pollutants such as inhalable dust, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, ammonia, lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Air pollution monitoring is being done in terms of urban ambient air quality, industrial air quality / fugitive emission, vehicle emission monitoring and stack monitoring. Air quality modelling is being done in terms of source dispersion modelling, point industrial emission, vehicular emission and area source emission, prediction of ambient air quality under different scenario in space and time, receptor modelling of particulate matter for source apportionment analysis and air quality trend analysis using statistical and neural network tools. The Institute is also involved in design and development of air pollution control systems in terms of emissions generation, treatment studies and design of air pollution control systems for small/medium scale industries. R & D activities in the area of environmental monitoring include development of efficient analytical techniques and low cost instruments, designing of national monitoring networks, development of national databases and training of manpower. The emphasis on development and application of monitoring techniques is now towards the use of PCR and gene probes for water quality monitoring, use of biological indicators for pollution monitoring and application of remote sensing and GIS. A portable arsenic estimation field kit has been developed by the Institute which can measure arsenic concentration below the maximum permissible limit of 10 ppb. = Environmental biotechnology and genomics = The Institute is involved in R&D; studies related to environmental biotechnology and subsequent application of biotechnology based solutions for environmental problems and sustainable development. The Institute is pursuing multidisciplinary R&D; in fundamental and applied areas of environmental biotechnology by exploiting knowledge base from microbiology, biochemistry, chemistry, molecular biology, chemical and environmental engineering disciplines. The Institute aims at developing eco-friendly biotechnological processes targeting societal and industrial needs to address issues related to restoration of environmental quality, bioremediation/waste treatment, waste to wealth, climate change mitigation etc. R & D activities in the field of environmental biotechnology have been undertaken related to the development and demonstration of technologies for substitution of non- renewable resource base with renewable resources, recycle and reuse of industrial and domestic wastewater, and utilization of industrial wastes and biomass for commercial production of chemicals. R & D studies on environmental biotechnology have led to the development of a microbial consortium to degrade persistent synthetic chlorinated cyclodiene and endosulfan. The Institute is involved in R&D; studies related to the existence, interaction, and survival of different gene pools with reference to each other in complex ecosystems. Monitoring tools with versatile computer modelling and simulation techniques have enabled the Institute to understand and explore a more holistic view of the interrelated aspects of environmental systems. At molecular level, the Institute carries out the study of structure, function, and interaction of the different gene pools, which are the constituents of the biogeochemical cycles of different components of the ecosystem. The Institute covers the study of either of the environmental factors, which can influence any life form including humans, plants, animals, and microorganisms. = Environmental impact and risk assessment = CSIR-NEERI ensures integration of environmental and socio-economic concerns in developmental planning by identifying environmental, biological and socio-economic impacts of proposed development projects and adopting remedial or mitigation measures including risk assessment. The studies carried out by the Institute enabled the developers and the government to abate the economic, social and environmental (including human health) impacts and develop mitigation measures. The Institute so far carried out environmental impact and risk assessment studies for more than 500 developmental projects proposed by various industries such as petrochemicals, oil & natural gas, refineries, mining, power plants (thermal, hydro and nuclear), chemicals and fertilizers, ports & harbours, irrigation and infrastructure, etc. EIA studies carried out by the Institute focused on analysis of concepts, approaches, methodology and evaluation processes; use of new technology development tools to enhance and strengthen the procedures and evaluation processes for impact assessment and recommendation with appropriate environmental management plan for sustainable development. = Environmental systems design & modelling = This Institute is involved in development and application of numerical models for prediction of environmental quality; development and application of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) based models and analytical tools for natural resources management; development and application of environmental systems design, detailed engineering, costing and drawings for the design of water supply and sewerage systems; development and application of environmental systems design, detailed engineering, costing and drawings for the design of water and wastewater treatment systems; application of advanced numerical and graphics tools (SPSS, MATLAB, ANN etc.) for environmental systems analysis and management. = Water technology and management = The Institute is involved in the following R&D; activities: environmental impact assessment and delineation of environmental management plan of water resources development projects; water conservation and environmental protection of the water bodies; eco-restoration of impounded surface water bodies and downstream system; limnological studies of surface water bodies; assessment of groundwater contamination from anthropogenic stresses; development of technique and methodology for exploration, assessment and management of groundwater in hard rock areas; delineation of contaminated region by geophysical methods, non- invasive methods in characterization of water and land environment; surveillance of drinking water quality; performance evaluation of water treatment facilities; technology development for improvement of water quality; development of analytical techniques for water quality assessment; monitoring and management of priority organic pollutants (POPs) and other pollutants; evaluation of water resources for health related water quality parameters; water quality management for pesticides contamination; restoration and remediation of degraded land; treatment of urban and industrial wastewater; catchment area treatment plan; techno-economic feasibility of steep slope stabilization through bio-engineering techniques; green belt development - land use planning; crop loss assessment due to various anthropocentric activities; protection of natural sources; and assessment of salinity ingress in coastal areas. The technology developed by CSIR-NEERI helped to set-up solar electrolytic defluoridation plants at various fluoride affected regions in the country. This technology is ensuring safe drinking water to the local people. The Institute has developed a water purification system – ‘NEERI ZAR’ suitable for potable water supply particularly under emergency situations like floods, heavy rainfall, or cyclones, and does not require electric supply. = Solid & hazardous waste management = The Institute is involved in the following R&D; activities in the area of solid & hazardous waste management: development of rapid composting technologies; waste to energy research; recycled organics utilization; monitoring of green house gas (GHG) emissions from landfills; quantification and characterization of solid waste; designing of secure landfills; eco-toxicological studies on landfill leachates; occupational health risk assessment on municipal solid waste (MSW) workers; transportation system designing for MSW transportation; E-waste management; cleaner technologies and waste minimization; recycling and reuse of MSW; bio- medical waste management; identification of hazardous waste streams; quantification and characterization of hazardous waste; development of treatment systems; and source reduction and recycling. The scientists are trying to develop a cost-effective process for bio-methanation of municipal solid waste with two-phase approach to generate bio-energy from the municipal solid waste. CSIR-NEERI helped Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUL) in remediation of its mercury contaminated site at Kodaikanal by providing a suitable technology. The Institute has also given an effective technological solution for environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes generated by NICOMET Industries Ltd. = Wastewater treatment technologies = CSIR-NEERI has been instrumental in designing and commissioning Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) for homogenous and heterogeneous industrial clusters in the country. CETPs designed and commissioned by CSIR-NEERI at various industrial clusters helped in prevention of water and soil pollution. 767 small scale industrial units in Pali, 249 in Balotra, and over 2000 industrial units in NCT of Delhi revived due to CETPs and as a result the employment of thousands of workers was protected, since these industrial units were on the verge of closure due to non-compliance of the pollution prevention norms. CETPs also helped in achieving ‘Economics of Scale’ in waste treatment, thereby reducing the cost of pollution abatement. CSIR-NEERI has carried out feasibility assessment studies of CETPs including identification of types and volumes of wastes generated, estimation of future waste loads, identification of treatment options, and evaluation of cleaner technologies. It has provided treatment options for zero liquid discharge for wastewater management for CETPs of textile industries in Tirupur and Ludhiana. Recently, the Institute has developed a two-stage bio-oxidation (TSB) process for treatment of high COD and ammonia bearing wastewater through ‘separated heterotrophic-autotrophic reactions’. This process eliminates chemical treatment and denitrification step. TSB process is implemented on large scale at Nagarjuna Agrochemical Limited, Srikakulam, A. P. CSIR-NEERI developed a design for the treatment and zero discharge of treated effluent of automobile industry through High Rate Transpiration System (HRTS) and this technology has been implemented at M/s Mahindra Vehicle Manufacture Limited, Pune. The Institute has developed a ‘phytorid sewage treatment technology’ which involves a constructed wetland exclusively designed for the treatment of municipal, urban, agricultural and industrial wastewater. This technology has been implemented by various industries and urban local bodies in the country. = Environmental policy analysis = CSIR-NEERI has been instrumental in formulation of environmental policies by carrying out analyses of existing policies against the international commitments and prevailing socio-economic conditions. The Institute has recommended various mechanisms so as to devise policy, planning, legal and informational measures for sustainable development. The Institute has been involved in the development of information packages on cleaner technologies for industrial production. From time to time the Institute has also been directed by the courts to provide inspection reports on various projects and review the existing enviro-legal framework. = Skill development = The Institute has established a Centre for Skill Development where certificate courses will be conducted in the domains of environmental impact assessment, carrying capacity, and water quality monitoring & assessment.

The series revolves around a carp called Bubbles and his friends. Plot Bubbles, a carp, lives in Carp Lake with his grandmother, who often tells him about the legendary, powerful ruler of the seas and the rivers: the Dragon, whom Bubbles idolises. One day, Bubbles encounters Evil Snake, who pretends that he is the Dragon King. Evil Snake and his two accomplices, Lobby and Bogart, accompany Bubbles to the lake, where Bubbles' grandmother suspects that he is an impostor. No one believes her at first until his \\"dragon horns\\" and fake skin slip from his body, and his identity is revealed. In anger, Evil Snake turns Bubbles' grandmother into a bubble in a fierce fight. Angry, Bubbles searches for the real dragon to revive his grandmother, and avenge her death by finding the five dragon scales left by the Dragon in order to beat Evil Snake. Along the way, he meets new friends, including the imposing Aku, the sassy Mei Mei, and the timid Erl, while Evil Snake and his henchmen relentlessly pursue Bubbles. Main characters *Bubbles(泡泡) - Bubbles is a curious young carp with the ability to blow bubbles. He has been living with his grandmother, to whom he is very loyal. Bubbles meets Mei-Mei and Aku at a circus run by Mr. Octavio the octopus, who invites him perform in his circus. Bubbles is golden coloured and has red fins, and he grows wings when he activates the golden scale which is part of the five dragon scales that have the power of the dragon. He is loyal, brave and always stands up for what's right, but because he is so kind, he is sometimes duped by villains. Bubbles is the first to gain a scale which is the golden scale, which is loosely based on the Chinese Element Gold. The golden scale is activated when the phrase \\"My heart is like iron, and it is indestructable!\\" Bubbles also blows bubbles to confuse his enemies, to send messages, to create protective spheres, or just for fun. * Aoqi (阿酷) - Sometimes called simply \\"Aku\\", Aoqi is a magician seahorse. Aoqi's parents were killed by Evil Snake when he was very young, and Mr Octavio later adopted him. Aoqi later learnt magic to defeat his foe. Aoqi is very smart, and when the gang finds themselves in sticky situations, he is usually the first to come up with a plan. He is depicted as pompous before joining the group, but stops after Bubbles saves his life. Aoqi is very kind despite his stern looks and bossy attitude. Aoqi fights mostly with his wand, and has also been depicted in episodes as having great speed. Aoqi is the second one to gain a scale, which is the blue/water scale. It is activated when he says the phrase \\"Brave and resourceful, my heart flies free!\\" It upgradeds his wand so that it can turn into whatever Aku calls for. * Xiao Mei Mei (小美美) is an anthropomorphic jellyfish. She is a singer who performs as the main star in Mr. Octavio's circus. She is sometimes depicted as a diva but tends to be the most forgiving and sensible of the group. She also likes anything that is cute and beautiful and hates things that are ugly. Mei Mei is the third one to gain a scale, which is the emerald scale. She activates it by singing unlike the other three, but occasionally has used the phrase \\"I am the voice of the ocean!\\" The activation of her chip causes here singing to be very powerful as it can calm down anything and stop it. * Erl/Xuang Mian Gui (双面龟) is a timid turtle that has the ability to remove his shell, which is two-sided. He is the first one to befriend Bubbles. He had previously been forced to work for Evil Snake, but changed for the sake of his beloved Mei Mei and because he has grown to see Bubbles and Aku as his friends. Erl typically makes poor decisions, thinking that his actions will make Mei-Mei happy. He often exaggerates his abilities and inflates his exploits to new people they meet, but in reality is a coward who runs away from any kind of danger. This changes when he is given his own scale, the fire scale, after proving that he is brave. He activates it with the phrase \\"By the power of fire, give me strength!\\" He gains the ability to control fire and every attack he makes is strengthened by fire. *Mr Octavio (章鱼) Mr Octavio is an octopus and the elderly ringleader of the \\"Dream Circus\\", where Aku and Mei Mei perform, and is more of a grandfather figure to Bubbles and a kind mentor. He was the first owner to get the golden scale in his youth, which he passes to Bubbles many years later. He is later captured by Evil Snake. Mr Octavio is not mentioned or appears in any episodes until the last quarter of the miniseries, where is turned into a monster and trapped in a trench, where he eats many of the fish. Fortunately, Bubbles and the gang released him from the spell eventually. *Giant Tortoise * Evil Snake (癞皮蛇) is an anthropomorphic seasnake with boils on his body, who calls himself the Dragon King. He usually wears a fake blue skin which resembles a hood, dragon horns to look like one and a magic mirror to see things. It can shrink, and he usually wears it between his horns. When the snake heard about the five magic scales and that maybe they could turn him into a real dragon he sets up to find them but he didn't expect that Bubbles and his friends would try to get all the magic scales as well. He then later gains a powerful item known as the Poisonous Fang that was passed down by his ancestors, and is helped by his two generals Lobby and Bogart and then by his cousin Ray. Evil Snake has magical powers e.g. turning into a stone, and unleashing electric snakes. He used to work for the real dragon with Master Phoenix and Father Sea Monster before it died. He is finally defeated by Bubbles and friends when they jumped the Dragon's Gate. * Lobby is one of the Evil Snake's generals, the other one being Bogart. He is a lobster which is the brains of the two as he is the one that makes up most of their plots to trick the gang. He and Bogart usually disguises themselves to trick Bubbles and the gang and gets a daily zap from their lord if they fail. He is also more deceitful than Bogart as he can be seen plotting a lot more to overthrow Evil Snake. He attacks by throwing claw-like projectiles but they temporarily melt in one episode when Mei Mei activates the emerald chip. He commands a group of small lobsters (they could be prawns) to patrol the area. He often masquerades as the 'White Jellyfish', and is killed when he falls into the lava with Bogart. * Bogart is one of the Evil Snake's generals, the other one being Lobby. He is a fat catfish who acts as the brawn of the group. He doesn't usually understands what Lobby is thinking but is very suspicious of him being a traitor to their lord. He commands a group of pond loaches to spy on Lobby and patrol the area. He often masquerades as the 'Black Jellyfish, and is also killed when he argues with Lobby on who should jump over the Dragon Gate. * Ray is a stingray and Evil Snake's cousin and a minor villain, who is later his second-in-command after he helps the Snake get the Poisonous Fang that belongs to their ancestors. He appears to the Snake just moments after Bubbles and the gang leaves the snake in the Coral Forest. He has been swallowed by the Evil Snake as he could not catch Bubbles and his gang.

It is based on canonical scripture, and sacred tradition, as interpreted authoritatively by the magisterium of the Catholic Church. This article serves as an introduction to various topics in Catholic theology, with links to where fuller coverage is found. Major teachings of the Catholic Church discussed in the early councils of the church are summarized in various creeds, especially the Nicene (Nicene- Constantinopolitan) Creed and the Apostles' Creed. Since the 16th century the Church has produced catechisms which summarize its teachings, most recently in 1992. The Catholic Church understands the living tradition of the Church to contain the essentials of its doctrine on faith and morals and to be protected from error, at times through infallibly defined teaching. The Church believes in revelation guided by the Holy Spirit through sacred scripture, developed in sacred tradition and entirely rooted in the original deposit of faith. This developed deposit of faith is protected by the \\"magisterium\\" or College of Bishops at ecumenical councils overseen by the pope, beginning with the Council of Jerusalem (). The most recent was the Second Vatican Council (1962 to 1965); twice in history the pope defined a dogma after consultation with all the bishops without calling a council. Formal Catholic worship is ordered by means of the liturgy, which is regulated by Church authority. The celebration of the Eucharist, one of seven sacraments, is the center of Catholic worship. The Church exercises control over additional forms of personal prayer and devotion including the Rosary, Stations of the Cross, and Eucharistic adoration, declaring they should all somehow derive from the Eucharist and lead back to it. The Church community consists of the ordained clergy (consisting of the episcopate, the priesthood, and the diaconate), the laity, and those like monks and nuns living a consecrated life under their constitutions. According to the Catechism, Christ instituted seven sacraments and entrusted them to the Church. These are Baptism, Confirmation (Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. The Catholic bishops at the Second Vatican Council, after centuries of celebration of the Mass in Latin, found it salutary to decree: > Pastors of souls must therefore realize that, when the liturgy is > celebrated, something more is required than the mere observation of the laws > governing valid and licit celebration; it is their duty also to ensure that > the faithful take part fully aware of what they are doing, actively engaged > in the rite, and enriched by its effects.  Profession of Faith  = Human capacity for God = The Catholic Church teaches that \\"The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself.\\" While man may turn away from God, God never stops calling man back to him. Because man is created in the image and likeness of God, man can know with certainty of God's existence from his own human reason. But while \\"Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God,\\" in order \\"for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man, and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith.\\" In summary, the Church teaches \\"Man is by nature and vocation a religious being. Coming from God, going toward God, man lives a fully human life only if he freely lives by his bond with God.\\" = God comes to meet humanity = The Church teaches God revealed himself gradually, beginning in the Old Testament, and completing this revelation by sending his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth as a man. This revelation started with Adam and Eve, and was not broken off by their original sin; rather, God promised to send a redeemer. God further revealed himself through covenants between Noah and Abraham. God delivered the law to Moses on Mount Sinai, and spoke through the Old Testament prophets. The fullness of God's revelation was made manifest through the coming of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. = Creeds = Creeds (from Latin credo meaning \\"I believe\\") are concise doctrinal statements or confessions, usually of religious beliefs. They began as baptismal formulas and were later expanded during the Christological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith. The Apostles Creed (Symbolum Apostolorum) was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries. It is the most popular creed used in worship by Western Christians. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.Jaroslav Pelikan and Valerie Hotchkiss, editors. Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition]. Yale University Press 2003 . The Nicene Creed, largely a response to Arianism, was formulated at the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople in 325 and 381 respectively,Catholics United for the Faith, \\"We Believe in One God\\"; Encyclopedia of Religion, \\"Arianism\\" and ratified as the universal creed of Christendom by the Council of Ephesus in 431.Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"Council of Ephesus\\" (1913). It sets out the main principles of Catholic Christian belief. This creed is recited at Sunday Masses and is the core statement of belief in many other Christian churches as well.Schaff, Creeds of Christendom, With a History and Critical Notes (1910), pp. 24, 56Richardson, The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology (1983), p. 132 The Chalcedonian Creed, developed at the Council of Chalcedon in 451,Christian History Institute, First Meeting of the Council of Chalcedon though not accepted by the Oriental Orthodox Churches,British Orthodox Church, The Oriental Orthodox Rejection of Chalcedon taught Christ \\"to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably\\": one divine and one human, and that both natures are perfect but are nevertheless perfectly united into one person.Pope Leo I, Letter to Flavian The Athanasian Creed, received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: \\"We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance.\\"Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"Athanasian Creed\\" (1913).  Scriptures  Christianity regards the Bible, a collection of canonical books in two parts (the Old Testament and the New Testament), as authoritative. It is believed by Christians to have been written by human authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and therefore for many it is held to be the inerrant Word of God.Second Helvetic Confession, Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, online text Protestants believe the Bible contains all revealed truth necessary for salvation. This concept is known as Sola scriptura.Keith Mathison, The Shape of Sola Scriptura (Canon Press, 2001) The books that are considered canonical vary depending upon the denomination using or defining it. These variations are a reflection of the range of traditions and councils that have convened on the subject. The Bible always includes books of the Jewish scriptures, the Tanakh, and includes additional books and reorganizes them into two parts: the books of the Old Testament primarily sourced from the Tanakh (with some variations), and the 27 books of the New Testament containing books originally written primarily in Greek. The Catholic and Orthodox canons include other books from the Septuagint Greek Jewish canon which Catholics call Deuterocanonical. Protestants consider these books apocryphal. Some versions of the Bible have a separate Apocrypha section for the books not considered canonical by the publisher.Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. Oxford Companion to the Bible. p. 39 Oxford University Press (1993). . Catholic theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual. The literal sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation. The spiritual sense has three subdivisions: the allegorical, moral, and anagogical (meaning mystical or spiritual) senses. * The allegorical sense includes typology. An example would be the parting of the Red Sea being understood as a \\"type\\" (sign) of baptism. * The moral sense understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching. * The anagogical interpretation includes eschatology and applies to eternity and the consummation of the world. Catholic theology adds other rules of interpretation which include: * the injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the literal;Thomas Aquinas \\"Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses\\"; cf. * the historical character of the four Gospels, and that they faithfully hand on what Jesus taught about salvation;Second Vatican Council Dei Verbum (V.19) * that scripture must be read within the \\"living Tradition of the whole Church\\"; * the task of authentic interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the pope.  Celebration of the Christian mystery  = Sacraments = There are seven sacraments of the Church, of which the source and summit is the Eucharist. According to the Catechism, the sacraments were instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church. They are vehicles through which God's grace flows into the person who receives them with the proper disposition. In order to obtain the proper disposition, people are encouraged, and in some cases required, to undergo sufficient preparation before being permitted to receive certain sacraments. And in receiving the sacraments, the Catechism advises: \\"To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand, is to fall into superstition.\\" Participation in the sacraments, offered to them through the Church, is a way Catholics obtain grace, forgiveness of sins and formally ask for the Holy Spirit. These sacraments are: Baptism, Confirmation (Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance and Reconciliation, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony. In the Eastern Catholic Churches, these are often called the holy mysteries rather than the sacraments. = Liturgy = Pope Benedict XVI celebrates the Eucharist at the canonization of Frei Galvão in São Paulo, Brazil on 11 May 2007 Sunday is a holy day of obligation, and Catholics are required to attend Mass. At Mass, Catholics believe that they respond to Jesus' command at the Last Supper to \\"do this in remembrance of me.\\" In 1570 at the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V codified a standard book for the celebration of Mass for the Roman Rite. Everything in this decree pertained to the priest celebrant and his action at the altar. The participation of the people was devotional rather than liturgical. The Mass text was in Latin, as this was the universal language of the Church. This liturgy was called the Tridentine Mass and endured universally until the Second Vatican Council approved the Mass of Paul VI, also known as the New Order of the Mass (), which may be celebrated either in the vernacular or in Latin. The Catholic Mass is separated into two parts. The first part is called Liturgy of the Word; readings from the Old and New Testaments are read prior to the gospel reading and the priest's homily. The second part is called Liturgy of the Eucharist, in which the actual sacrament of the Eucharist is celebrated. Catholics regard the Eucharist as \\"the source and summit of the Christian life\\", and believe that the bread and wine brought to the altar are changed, or transubstantiated, through the power of the Holy Spirit into the true body, blood, soul and divinity of Christ. Since his sacrifice on the Cross and that of the Eucharist \\"are one single sacrifice\\", the church does not purport to re-sacrifice Jesus in the Mass, but rather to re-present (i.e., make present) his sacrifice \\"in an unbloody manner\\".  Eastern Catholic  In the Eastern Catholic Churches, the term Divine Liturgy is used in place of Mass, and various Eastern rites are used in place of the Roman Rite. These rites have remained more constant than has the Roman Rite, going back to early church times. Eastern Catholic and Orthodox liturgies are generally quite similar. The liturgical action is seen as transcending time and uniting the participants with those already in the heavenly kingdom. Elements in the liturgy are meant to symbolize eternal realities; they go back to early Christian traditions which evolved from the Jewish-Christian traditions of the early church. The first part of the Liturgy, or \\"Liturgy of the Catechumens\\", has scripture readings and at times a homily. The second part derives from the Last Supper as celebrated by the early Christians. The belief is that by partaking of the Communion bread and wine, the Body and Blood of Christ, they together become the body of Christ on earth, the church.  Liturgical calendar  In the Latin Church, the annual calendar begins with Advent, a time of hope-filled preparation for both the celebration of Jesus' birth and his Second Coming at the end of time. Readings from \\"Ordinary Time\\" follow the Christmas Season, but are interrupted by the celebration of Easter in Spring, preceded by 40 days of Lenten preparation and followed by 50 days of Easter celebration. The Easter (or Paschal) Triduum splits the Easter vigil of the early church into three days of celebration, of Jesusthe Lord's Supper, of Good Friday (Jesus' passion and death on the cross), and of Jesus' resurrection. The season of Eastertide follows the Triduum and climaxes on Pentecost, recalling the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus' disciples in the upper room.  Holy Trinity  Holy Trinity by Francesco Cairo (1607–1665) The Trinity refers to the belief in one God, in three distinct persons or hypostases. Trinity is from Latin Word (Tris Unitas) English (Three in One/One in Three)IJohn 5:7 KJV. These are referred to as 'the Father' (the creator and source of all life), 'the Son' (the word or expression of the Father, who also became incarnate in Jesus Christ), and 'the Holy Spirit' (the bond of love between Father and Son, present in the hearts of humankind). Together, these three persons form a single Godhead.J.N.D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines, pp. 87–90T. Desmond Alexander, New Dictionary of Biblical Theology, pp. 514–15Alister E. McGrath, Historical Theology p. 61 The word trias, from which trinity is derived, is first seen in the works of Theophilus of Antioch. He wrote of \\"the Trinity of God (the Father), His Word (the Son) and His Wisdom (Holy Spirit)\\".Theophilus of Antioch Apologia ad Autolycum II 15 The term may have been in use before this time. Afterwards it appears in Tertullian.McManners, John. Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity. p. 50 Oxford University Press (1990) .Tertullian De Pudicitia chapter 21 In the following century the word was in general use. It is found in many passages of Origen.McManners, John. Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity. p. 53. Oxford University Press (1990) . According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see Perichoresis). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being eternal yet begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit 'proceeding' from Father and (in Western theology) from the Son.Vladimir Lossky; Loraine Boettner Regardless of this apparent difference in their origins, the three 'persons' are each eternal and omnipotent. This is thought by Trinitarian Christians to be the revelation regarding God's nature which Jesus Christ came to deliver to the world, and is the foundation of their belief system. According to a prominent Catholic theologian of the 20th century: \\"In God’s self communication to his creation through grace and Incarnation, God really gives himself, and really appears as he is in himself.\\" This would lead to the conclusion that we come to a knowledge of the immanent Trinity through the study of God's work in the \\"Economy\\" of creation and salvation. = God the Father = Depiction of God the Father offering the right hand throne to Christ, Pieter de Grebber, 1654. Utrecht, Museum Catharijneconvent. The orb, or the globe of the world, is almost exclusively associated with the Father in depictions of the Trinity The central statement of Catholic faith, the Nicene Creed, begins, \\"I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.\\" Thus, Catholics believe that God is not a part of nature, but that God created nature and all that exists. God is viewed as a loving and caring God who is active both in the world and in people's lives, and desires humankind to love one another. = God the Son = Christ depicted as the creator of the world, Byzantine mosaic in Monreale, Sicily. Catholics believe that Jesus is God incarnate, \\"true God and true man\\" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human, suffered our pain, finally succumbed to his injuries and gave up his spirit he said, \\"it is finished.\\" temptations, but did not sin.Hebrews 4:15 As true God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the New Testament, \\"God raised him from the dead,\\", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , he ascended to heaven, is \\"seated at the right hand of the Father\\" and will return again to fulfil the rest of Messianic prophecy, including the resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment and final establishment of the Kingdom of God. According to the gospels of Matthew and Luke, Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born from the Virgin Mary. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the canonical gospels, although infancy gospels were popular in antiquity. In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, are well documented in the gospels contained within the New Testament. The biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include: his baptism, healings, teaching, and \\"going about doing good\\". = God the Holy Spirit = The Holy Spirit as depicted by Corrado Giaquinto (1703–1766) Jesus told his apostles that after his death and resurrection he would send them the \\"Advocate\\" (; ), the \\"Holy Spirit\\", who \\"will teach you everything and remind you of all that I told you\\".Barry, One Faith, One Lord (2001), p. 37 In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells his disciples \\"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\\"Schreck, The Essential Catholic Catechism (1997), pp. 230–31 The Nicene Creed states that the Holy Spirit is one with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus); thus, for Catholics, receiving the Holy Spirit is receiving God, the source of all that is good.Kreeft, Catholic Christianity (2001), p. 88 Catholics formally ask for and receive the Holy Spirit through the sacrament of Confirmation (Chrismation). Sometimes called the sacrament of Christian maturity, Confirmation is believed to bring an increase and deepening of the grace received at Baptism, to which it was cojoined in the early church. Spiritual graces or gifts of the Holy Spirit can include wisdom to see and follow God's plan, right judgment, love for others, boldness in witnessing the faith, and rejoicing in the presence of God. The corresponding fruits of the Holy Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.Schreck, The Essential Catholic Catechism (1997), p. 277 To be validly confirmed, a person must be in a state of grace, which means that they cannot be conscious of having committed a mortal sin. They must also have prepared spiritually for the sacrament, chosen a sponsor or godparent for spiritual support, and selected a saint to be their special patron.  Soteriology  = Sin and salvation = Soteriology is the branch of doctrinal theology that deals with salvation through Christ.title url Eternal life, divine life, cannot be merited but is a free gift of God. The crucifixion of Jesus is explained as an atoning sacrifice, which, in the words of the Gospel of John, \\"takes away the sins of the world.\\" One's reception of salvation is related to justification.Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. Oxford Companion to the Bible. p. 405 Oxford University Press (1993). .  Fall of Man  According to Church teaching, in an event known as the \\"fall of the angels\\", a number of angels chose to rebel against God and his reign. The leader of this rebellion has been given many names including \\"Lucifer\\" (meaning \\"light bearer\\" in Latin), \\"Satan\\", and the devil. The sin of pride, considered one of seven deadly sins, is attributed to Satan for desiring to be God's equal.Schreck, The Essential Catholic Catechism (1997), p. 57 According to Genesis, a fallen angel tempted the first humans, Adam and Eve, who then sinned, bringing suffering and death into the world. The Catechism states:  Sin  Christians classify certain behaviors and acts to be \\"sinful,\\" which means that these certain acts are a violation of conscience or divine law. Catholics make a distinction between two types of sin. Mortal sin is a \\"grave violation of God's law\\" that \\"turns man away from God\\", and if it is not redeemed by repentance it can cause exclusion from Christ's kingdom and the eternal death of hell. In contrast, venial sin (meaning \\"forgivable\\" sin) \\"does not set us in direct opposition to the will and friendship of God\\" and, although still \\"constituting a moral disorder\\", does not deprive the sinner of friendship with God, and consequently the eternal happiness of heaven.  Jesus Christ as savior  A depiction of Jesus and Mary, the Theotokos of Vladimir (12th century) In the Old Testament, God promised to send his people a savior.Kreeft, Catholic Christianity (2001), pp. 71–72 The church believes that this savior was Jesus whom John the Baptist called \\"the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world\\". The Nicene Creed refers to Jesus as \\"the only begotten son of God, … begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made.\\" In a supernatural event called the Incarnation, Catholics believe God came down from heaven for our salvation, became man through the power of the Holy Spirit and was born of a virgin Jewish girl named Mary. They believe Jesus' mission on earth included giving people his word and example to follow, as recorded in the four Gospels.McGrath, Christianity: An Introduction (2006), pp. 4–6 The Church teaches that following the example of Jesus helps believers to grow more like him, and therefore to true love, freedom, and the fullness of life.Schreck, The Essential Catholic Catechism (1997), p. 265 The focus of a Christian's life is a firm belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the \\"Messiah\\" or \\"Christ\\". The title \\"Messiah\\" comes from the Hebrew word מָשִׁיחַ (māšiáħ) meaning anointed one. The Greek translation (Christos) is the source of the English word \\"Christ\\".McGrath, Alister E. Christianity:An Introduction. pp. 4–6. Blackwell Publishing (2006). . Christians believe that, as the Messiah, Jesus was anointed by God as ruler and savior of humanity, and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. The Christian concept of the Messiah differs significantly from the contemporary Jewish concept. The core Christian belief is that, through the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans (which are all humans (Romans 3:23)) can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life in heaven.Metzger, Bruce M. and Michael Coogan, editors. Oxford Companion to the Bible. pp. 513, 649. Oxford University Press (1993). . Catholics believe in the resurrection of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus, the central figure of Christianity, was crucified, died, buried within a tomb, and resurrected three days later., , The New Testament mentions several resurrection appearances of Jesus on different occasions to his twelve apostles and disciples, including \\"more than five hundred brethren at once\\", before Jesus' Ascension. Jesus's death and resurrection are the essential doctrines of the Christian faith, and are commemorated by Christians during Good Friday and Easter, as well as on each Sunday and in each celebration of the Eucharist, the Paschal feast.

The death and resurrection of Jesus are the most important events in Christian Theology, as they form the point in scripture where Jesus gives his ultimate demonstration that he has power over life and death and thus the ability to give people eternal life., , , , , , and . Generally, Christian churches accept and teach the New Testament account of the resurrection of Jesus.This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England, works contained in the Book of Concord, and others.Two denominations in which a resurrection of Jesus is not a doctrine are the Quakers and the Unitarians. Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the historical Jesus and the proclamation of the early church.Fuller, Reginald H. The Foundations of New Testament Christology. p. 11 Scribners (1965). . Some liberal Christians do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,A Jesus Seminar conclusion: \\"in the view of the Seminar, he did not rise bodily from the dead; the resurrection is based instead on visionary experiences of Peter, Paul, and Mary.\\"Funk, Robert. The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?. Polebridge Press (1998). . but hold to a convincing interior experience of Jesus' Spirit in members of the early church. The church teaches that as signified by the passion of Jesus and his crucifixion, all people have an opportunity for forgiveness and freedom from sin, and so can be reconciled to God. Sinning according to the Greek word in scripture, amartia, \\"falling short of the mark\\", succumbing to our imperfection: we always remain on the road to perfection in this life. People can sin by failing to obey the Ten Commandments, failing to love God, and failing to love other people. Some sins are more serious than others, ranging from lesser, venial sins, to grave, mortal sins that sever a person's relationship with God.Barry, One Faith, One Lord (2001), p. 77 = Penance and conversion =  Grace and free will  The operation and effects of grace are understood differently by different traditions. Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy teach the necessity of the free will to cooperate with grace. This does not mean we can come to God on our own and then cooperate with grace, as Semipelagianism, an early church heresy, postulates. Human nature is not evil, since God creates no evil thing, but we continue in or are inclined to sin (concupiscence). We need grace from God to be able to \\"repent and believe in the gospel.\\" Reformed theology, by contrast, teaches that people are completely incapable of self-redemption to the point human nature itself is evil, but the grace of God overcomes even the unwilling heart.Westminster Confession, Chapter X ; Charles Spurgeon, A Defense of Calvinism . Arminianism takes a synergistic approach while Lutheran doctrine teaches justification by grace alone through faith alone, though \\"a common understanding of the doctrine of justification\\" has been reached with some Lutheran theologians.  Forgiveness of sins  According to Catholicism, forgiveness of sins and purification can occur during life – for example, in the sacraments of Baptism and Reconciliation. However, if this purification is not achieved in life, venial sins can still be purified after death. The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is performed only by a priest, since it involves elements of forgiveness of sin. The priest anoints with oil the head and hands of the ill person while saying the prayers of the Church.Kreeft, Catholic Christianity (2001), p. 373  Baptism and second conversion  St Augustine by Benozzo Gozzoli People can be cleansed from all personal sins through Baptism.Kreeft, Catholic Christianity (2001), p. 308 This sacramental act of cleansing admits one as a full member of the church and is only conferred once in a person's lifetime. The Catholic Church considers baptism so important \\"parents are obliged to see that their infants are baptised within the first few weeks\\" and, \\"if the infant is in danger of death, it is to be baptised without any delay.\\" It declares: \\"The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the Church. There is explicit testimony to this practice from the second century on, and it is quite possible that, from the beginning of the apostolic preaching, when whole 'households' received baptism, infants may also have been baptized.\\" At the Council of Trent, on 15 November 1551, the necessity of a second conversion after baptism was delineated: David MacDonald, a Catholic apologist, has written in regard to paragraph 1428, that \\"this endeavor of conversion is not just a human work. It is the movement of a \\"contrite heart,\\" drawn and moved by grace to respond to the merciful love of God who loved us first.\\"  Penance and Reconciliation  Since Baptism can only be received once, the sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation is the principal means by which Catholics obtain forgiveness for subsequent sin and receive God's grace and assistance not to sin again. This is based on Jesus' words to his disciples in the Gospel of John 20:21–23.Kreeft, Catholic Christianity (2001), p. 336 A penitent confesses his sins to a priest who may then offer advice or impose a particular penance to be performed. The penitent then prays an act of contrition and the priest administers absolution, formally forgiving the person's sins.Kreeft, Catholic Christianity (2001), p. 344 A priest is forbidden under penalty of excommunication to reveal any matter heard under the seal of the confessional. Penance helps prepare Catholics before they can validly receive the Holy Spirit in the sacraments of Confirmation (Chrismation) and the Eucharist. = Afterlife =  Eschaton  The Nicene Creed ends with, \\"We look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.\\" Accordingly, the Church teaches each person will appear before the judgment seat of Christ immediately after death and receive a particular judgment based on the deeds of their earthly life.Schreck, The Essential Catholic Catechism (1997), pp. 379–86 Chapter 25:35–46 of the Gospel of Matthew underpins the Catholic belief that a day will also come when Jesus will sit in a universal judgment of all humankind.Barry, One Faith, One Lord (2001), p. 98, quote: \\"Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me … amen I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.\\" The final judgment will bring an end to human history. It will also mark the beginning of a new heaven and earth in which righteousness dwells and God will reign forever.Schreck, The Essential Catholic Catechism (1997), p. 397 There are three states of afterlife in Catholic belief. Heaven is a time of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever. Purgatory is a temporary state of purification for those who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were not sorry for their sins, and had no intention of changing their ways go to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches no one is condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God's love. God predestines no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned. Catholicism teaches that God's mercy is such that a person can repent even at the point of death and be saved, like the good thief who was crucified next to Jesus. At the second coming of Christ at the end of time, all who have died will be resurrected bodily from the dead for the Last Judgement, whereupon Jesus will fully establish the Kingdom of God in fulfillment of scriptural prophecies.Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis questions 69 through 99  Prayer for the dead and indulgences  The pope depicted as the Antichrist, signing and selling indulgences, from Martin Luther's 1521 Passional Christi und Antichristi, by Lucas Cranach the Elder The Catholic Church teaches that the fate of those in purgatory can be affected by the actions of the living. In the same context there is mention of the practice of indulgences. An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven. Indulgences may be obtained for oneself, or on behalf of Christians who have died. Prayers for the dead and indulgences have been envisioned as decreasing the \\"duration\\" of time the dead would spend in purgatory. Traditionally, most indulgences were measured in term of days, \\"quarantines\\" (i.e. 40-day periods as for Lent), or years, meaning that they were equivalent to that length of canonical penance on the part of a living Christian. When the imposition of such canonical penances of a determinate duration fell into desuetude these expressions were sometimes popularly misinterpreted as reduction of that much time of a person's stay in purgatory. (The concept of time, like that of space, is of doubtful applicability to purgatory.) In Pope Paul VI's revision of the rules concerning indulgences, these expressions were dropped, and replaced by the expression \\"partial indulgence\\", indicating that the person who gained such an indulgence for a pious action is granted, \\"in addition to the remission of temporal punishment acquired by the action itself, an equal remission of punishment through the intervention of the Church.\\"Pope Paul VI, Apostolic Constitution on Indulgences, norm 5 Historically, the practice of granting indulgences and the widespreadSection \\"Abuses\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia: Purgatory associated abuses, which led to their being seen as increasingly bound up with money, with criticisms being directed against the \\"sale\\" of indulgences, were a source of controversy that was the immediate occasion of the Protestant Reformation in Germany and Switzerland. = Salvation outside the Church = The Catholic Church teaches that it is the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church founded by Jesus. Concerning non-Catholics, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, drawing on the document Lumen gentium from Vatican II, explains the statement \\"Outside the Church there is no salvation\\": > Reformulated positively, this statement means that all salvation comes from > Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body. Basing itself on > Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now > on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the > way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He > himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby > affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter > through Baptism as through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, > knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through > Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it. This affirmation > is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ > and his Church ... but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, > moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through > the dictates of their conscience – those too may achieve eternal salvation. > Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no fault > of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith without which it is > impossible to please him, the Church still has the obligation and also the > sacred right to evangelize all men.  Ecclesiology  = Church as the Mystical Body of Christ = Catholics believe the Catholic Church is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth.Schreck, The Essential Catholic Catechism (1997), p. 131 Jesus told his disciples \\"Abide in me, and I in you. … I am the vine, you are the branches\\". Thus, for Catholics, the term \\"Church\\" refers not merely to a building or exclusively to the ecclesiastical hierarchy, but first and foremost to the people of God who abide in Jesus and form the different parts of his spiritual body,Norman, The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History (2007), p. 12 which together composes the worldwide Christian community. Catholics believe the Church exists simultaneously on earth (Church militant), in Purgatory (Church suffering), and in Heaven (Church triumphant); thus Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the other saints are alive and part of the living Church.Kreeft, Catholic Christianity (2001), pp. 113–14 This unity of the Church in heaven and on earth is called the \\"communion of saints\\".Kreeft, Catholic Christianity (2001), p. 114 = One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic = Section 8 of the Second Vatican Council's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen gentium, states \\"this Church constituted and organized in the world as a society, subsists in the Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with him, although many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside of its visible structure. These elements, as gifts belonging to the Church of Christ, are forces impelling toward catholic unity.\\" =Faith of the church= Faith of the Church (Latin: fides ecclesiae) is a basic concept of Catholic theology which implies that not the faithful individual but the Catholic Church as a whole is considered to be the primary carrier of Christian faith.https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PY.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 166-169] This refers to the act of believing (fides qua creditur) as well as to the matters of doctrine (fides quae creditur). According to Catholic teaching, the Church has received the complete faith by Jesus Christ through the apostles (depositum fidei). Led by the Holy Spirit, as promised by Christ (John 16:12-14), the Church progressively during the times \\"unpacks\\" and displays the germ of the creed, such keeping it actual and alive. May there be reductions or unbalances in single ages or regions, the Church as a whole, however, is trusted to be sustained in the truth and to maturate towards its complete understanding. Equally, in this concept, the act of believing, the personal devotion to the holy and inconceivable God, for the individual is participation in the devotion of the Church, which means in the devotion of Christ himself to the Father in the Holy Spirit. The single faithful, in consequence, is invited to acquire the faith of the Church, as assiduously as possible, into his personal possession, nevertheless being aware of the insufficiency of isolated cogitation and listening to the common voice of the Church.  Devotion to the Virgin Mary and the saints  The Holy Family Catholics believe that the Church (community of Christians) exists both on earth and in heaven simultaneously, and thus the Virgin Mary and the Saints are alive and part of the living Church. Prayers and devotions to Mary and the saints are common practices in Catholic life. These devotions are not worship, since only God is worshiped. The Church teaches the Saints \\"do not cease to intercede with the Father for us. ... So by their fraternal concern is our weakness greatly helped.\\" Catholics venerate Mary with many titles such as \\"Blessed Virgin\\", \\"Mother of God\\", \\"Help of Christians\\", \\"Mother of the Faithful\\". She is given special honor and devotion above all other saints but this honor and devotion differs essentially from the adoration given to God. Catholics do not worship Mary but honor her as mother of God, mother of the Church, and as a spiritual mother to each believer in Christ. She is called the greatest of the saints, the first disciple, and Queen of Heaven (Rev. 12:1). Catholic belief encourages following her example of holiness. Prayers and devotions asking for her intercession, such as the Rosary, the Hail Mary, and the Memorare are common Catholic practice. The Church devotes several liturgical feasts to Mary, mainly the Immaculate Conception, Mary, Mother of God, the Visitation, the Assumption, the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary; and in the Americas the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Pilgrimages to Marian shrines like Lourdes, France, and Fátima, Portugal, are also a common form of devotion and prayer.  Ordained ministry: Bishops, priests, and deacons  Roman Catholic deacon wearing a dalmatic Men become bishops, priests or deacons through the sacrament of Holy Orders. Candidates to the priesthood must have a college degree in addition to another four years of theological training, including pastoral theology. The Catholic Church, following the example of Christ and Apostolic tradition, ordains only males. The Church teaches that, apart from ministry reserved for priests, women should participate in all aspects in the Church's life and leadership The bishops are believed to possess the fullness of Catholic priesthood; priests and deacons participate in the ministry of the bishop. As a body, the College of Bishops are considered the successors of the Apostles. The pope, cardinals, patriarchs, primates, archbishops and metropolitans are all bishops and members of the Catholic Church episcopate or College of Bishops. Only bishops canperform the sacrament of holy orders. Many bishops head a diocese, which is divided into parishes. A parish is usually staffed by at least one priest. Beyond their pastoral activity, a priest may perform other functions, including study, research, teaching or office work. They may also be rectors or chaplains. Other titles or functions held by priests include those of Archimandrite, Canon Secular or Regular, Chancellor, Chorbishop, Confessor, Dean of a Cathedral Chapter, Hieromonk, Prebendary, Precentor, etc. Permanent deacons, those who do not seek priestly ordination, preach and teach. They may also baptize, lead the faithful in prayer, witness marriages, and conduct wake and funeral services. Candidates for the diaconate go through a diaconate formation program and must meet minimum standards set by the bishops' conference in their home country. Upon completion of their formation program and acceptance by their local bishop, candidates receive the sacrament of Holy Orders. In August 2016 Pope Francis established the Study Commission on the Women's Diaconate, to determine whether ordaining women as deacons should be revived. This would include the deacon's role of preaching at the Eucharist. While deacons may be married, only celibate men are ordained as priests in the Latin Church. Protestant clergy who have converted to the Catholic Church are sometimes excepted from this rule. The Eastern Catholic Churches ordain both celibate and married men. All rites of the Catholic Church maintain the ancient tradition that, after ordination, marriage is not allowed. A married priest whose wife dies may not remarry. Men with \\"transitory\\" homosexual leanings may be ordained deacons following three years of prayer and chastity, but men with \\"deeply rooted homosexual tendencies\\" who are sexually active cannot be ordained. = Apostolic succession = Apostolic succession is the belief that the pope and Catholic bishops are the spiritual successors of the original twelve apostles, through the historically unbroken chain of consecration (see: Holy orders). The pope is the spiritual head and leader of the Catholic Church who makes use of the Roman Curia to assist him in governing. He is elected by the College of Cardinals who may choose from any male member of the Church but who must be ordained a bishop before taking office. Since the 15th century, a current cardinal has always been elected. The New Testament contains warnings against teachings considered to be only masquerading as Christianity,; ; ; and shows how reference was made to the leaders of the Church to decide what was true doctrine. The Catholic Church believes it is the continuation of those who remained faithful to the apostolic leadership and rejected false teachings. Catholic belief is that the Church will never defect from the truth, and bases this on Jesus' telling Peter \\"the gates of hell will not prevail against\\" the Church. In the Gospel of John, Jesus states, \\"I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now. But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth\\". = Clerical celibacy = Regarding clerical celibacy, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: The Catholic Church's discipline of mandatory celibacy for priests within the Latin Church (while allowing very limited individual exceptions) has been criticized for not following either the Protestant Reformation practice, which rejects mandatory celibacy, or the Eastern Catholic Churches's and Eastern Orthodox Churches's practice, which requires celibacy for bishops and priestmonks and excludes marriage by priests after ordination, but does allow married men to be ordained to the priesthood. In July 2006, Bishop Emmanuel Milingo created the organization Married Priests Now! Responding to Milingo's November 2006 consecration of bishops, the Vatican stated \\"The value of the choice of priestly celibacy... has been reaffirmed.\\" Conversely, some young men in the United States are increasingly entering formation for the priesthood because of the long-held, traditional teaching on priestly celibacy.  Contemporary issues  = Catholic social teaching = The Last Judgment—Fresco in the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo Catholic social teaching is based on the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of all others. Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require Catholics to share their knowledge with others, comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who hurt them, give advice and correction to those who need it, and pray for the living and the dead. = Creation and evolution = Today, the Church's official position remains a focus of controversy and is non-specific, stating only that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, specifically: the Church allows for the possibility that the human body developed from previous biological forms but it was by God's special providence that the immortal soul was given to humankind. This view falls into the spectrum of viewpoints that are grouped under the concept of theistic evolution (which is itself opposed by several other significant points-of- view; see Creation–evolution controversy for further discussion).  Comparison of traditions  = Latin and Eastern Catholicism = The Eastern Catholic Churches have as their theological, spiritual, and liturgical patrimony the traditions of Eastern Christianity. Thus, there are differences in emphasis, tone, and articulation of various aspects of Catholic theology between the Eastern and Latin churches, as in Mariology. Likewise, medieval Western scholasticism, that of Thomas Aquinas in particular, has had little reception in the East. While Eastern Catholics respect papal authority, and largely hold the same theological beliefs as Latin Catholics, Eastern theology differs on specific Marian beliefs. The traditional Eastern expression of the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary, for instance, is the Dormition of the Theotokos, which emphasizes her falling asleep to be later assumed into heaven. The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is a teaching of Eastern origin, but is expressed in the terminology of the Western Church. Eastern Catholics, though they do not observe the Western Feast of the Immaculate Conception, have no difficulty affirming it or even dedicating their churches to the Virgin Mary under this title.http://www.assumptioncatholicchurch.net/ Many Eastern Catholic churches bear the titles of Latin Church doctrines such as the Assumption of Mary. = Orthodox and Protestant = The beliefs of other Christian denominations differ from those of Catholics to varying degrees. Eastern Orthodox belief differs mainly with regard to papal infallibility, the filioque clause, and the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, but is otherwise quite similar.Langan, The Catholic Tradition (1998), p. 118Parry, The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity (1999), p. 292 Protestant churches vary in beliefs, but generally differ from Catholics regarding the authority of the pope and church tradition, as well as the role of Mary and the saints, the role of the priesthood, and issues pertaining to grace, good works, and salvation.McManners, Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity (2002), pp. 254–60 The five solas were one attempt to express these differences.

The estate also produces the second wine La Vieille Dame de Trotte Vieille. History Situated below Château Troplong Mondot, the name of the estate is suggested to derive from la trotte vieille (English: old trotting lady), invoking a story of an elderly woman who once regularly trotted by nearby roads.

There are also African variants. The moral lessons to be learned from these differ and depend on the context in which they are told. Early Indian versions Nalanda Temple 2, 7th cent ce. A tale concerning a talkative tortoise appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the Kacchapa Jataka. In this version, it is framed by the account of a talkative king who finds in his courtyard a tortoise that has fallen from the sky and split in two. His adviser explains that this had come about as a result of talking too much. A tortoise had become friendly with two geese who promised to take it to their home in the Himalayas. They would hold a stick in their beaks while the tortoise would grasp it in his mouth, but he must be careful not to talk. Children below made fun of it during the journey and when it answered back it fell to its destruction. Jataka tales were a favourite subject for sculpture and this story is found as a bas relief on various religious buildings in India and Java. Often depicted as synoptic narratives, the episodes encountered include the birds carrying the tortoise between them, its fall and its fate on reaching the earth.Jean Philippe Vogel, The Goose in Indian Literature and Art, Leiden 1962 pp.44-6 In the 9th century Mendut temple in Java, for example, the birds and tortoise appear at top right, while on the ground huntsmen take aim with bows. Immediately below, the same three are preparing the fallen body for food. As in the Mendut example, other versions of the story are depicted even in Buddhist contexts. In the Indian literary variation of the story in the Panchatantra, the tortoise and her friends live in a lake that is beginning to dry up. Pitying the future suffering of their friend, the geese suggest they fly off with her in the manner already described. On hearing the comments of people in the city they are passing, the tortoise tells them to mind their own business. After her fall in consequence, she is cut up and eaten.Franklin Edgerton, The Panchatantra Reconstructed, American Oriental Series, New Haven, 1924 The story was eventually included in the tales of Bidpai and travelled westward via translations into Persian, Syriac, Arabic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin. The last of these began to be translated into other European languages at the end of the Middle Ages. A still later retelling appears in the Hitopadesha, where the migration occurs because of the appearance of a fisherman. Cowherds below suggest that the flying tortoise would make a good meal and it falls while making an acid response.J.P.Vogel, p.43 An Italian version of Bidpai's fables was early translated into English by Thomas North under the title of The Morall Philosophie of Doni (1570). The story of the tortoise and the birds appears in a section illustrating the sentiment that 'a man hath no greater enemy than himself'. The French fabulist Jean de la Fontaine also found the story in an early digest of Bidpai's work and added it to his fables as La Tortue et les deux Canards (X.3). For him the story illustrates human vanity and imprudence. His tortoise tires of living in the same place and decides to travel. Two ducks offer to fly her to America but, while on their way, she hears people below describe her as 'the queen of tortoises' and shouts agreement.Translation of the poem It is on this that Alexander Sumarokov appears to have based his Russian version, in which the ducks set out to carry the tortoise to France.Item XI, \\"Черепаха\\", in ПОЛНОЕ СОБРАНІЕ ВСѢХЪ СОЧИНЕНIЙ въ СТИХАХЪ И ПРОЗѢ, ПОКОЙНАГО ...

Alexander Petrovich Sumarokov), Moscow, 1787 Travelling eastwards too, the story exists as a Mongolian folk tale with a different animal character. In this variation, a frog is jealous of geese discussing their coming migration and complains that they are fortunate to be able to fly to a warmer climate in winter. The geese suggest the stick plan to the frog and they set off. The frog is so delighted with himself that he cannot resist shouting down to the frogs he is leaving behind and soon rejoins them disastrously. A variation on this appears in the Russian author Vsevolod Garshin's story called \\"The Traveler Frog\\" (Лягушка- путешественница), which was adapted into a cartoon in 1965.The 17-minute Russian-language version is available on YouTube There, the frog falls because it wants to tell those below that the traveling was its own idea, and not that of the ducks that carry him. Unlike in most variants, the frog falls into a pond and survives to boast of its supposed travels.An English translation appears as the final story in this collection Versions in Aesop's Fables Jacobs' collection, 1894 There are two stories concerning a tortoise and various birds ascribed to Aesop, one in the Greek of Babrius and the other in the Latin of Phaedrus. In the Greek version, a tortoise yearns to see more of the earth and persuades the eagle to fly up with it, promising in return 'all the gifts that come from the Eastern Sea'. Once they are above the clouds, the eagle drops it onto a mountaintop. The story was given the moral that one should be content with one's lot. It spread through Europe via Latin versions in the collections of Avianus and Odo of Cheriton. Thereafter it cross- fertilised with tellings of the Indian version of the fable. The tortoise's discontent is supplied to La Fontaine's fable from this source, as it is in Jefferys Taylor's poem The Tortoise. Babrius gives no reason for the eagle's treachery; Avianus suggests that this was because the promised payment was not forthcoming. It is the uncertainty of life, into which treachery enters, that is the subject of the alternative version of the fable, told by Phaedrus as \\"The Eagle and the Crow\\" (2.6). It begins with the comment that 'no one is sufficiently well armed against the high and the mighty, and if there is a malicious advisor involved as well, then whoever falls victim to their criminal forces will be destroyed.' To illustrate this, he relates how an eagle has seized a tortoise but cannot eat it because of the protective shell. A passing crow advises the eagle to drop the animal 'from the starry heights' onto the rocks below, after which the two birds share its meat. By the time the story is retold by Walter of England an element of treachery has been added. The crow meets the frustrated eagle on the ground and advises it to soar up and drop its prey. Waiting behind by the rocks, the crow flies off with the fallen tortoise before the eagle can return. African fables An Igbo fable concerning the tortoise and the birds has gained wide distribution because it occurs in the famous novel Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. The tortoise, who is a West African trickster figure, hears of a feast to be given by the sky-dwellers to the birds and persuades them to take him with them, winged in their feathers. There he tells the hosts that his name is 'All-of- you' and, when they provide the food with the assurance that 'This is for all of you', claims the entire feast. The enraged birds claim their feathers back and leave. Only the parrot will agree to take a message to the tortoise's wife to pull the bedding from his house and leave it on the ground. Instead the parrot tells her to bring out all the hard things so that when the tortoise jumps down its shell is broken. He survives, however, and the broken shell is glued together. This provides the explanation of why the tortoise's shell is so uneven. Much the same story is now claimed by the Swazi people and the Kikuyu. Merged stories and adaptations Some retellings of the tortoise fables are extended in such a way as to suggest that two stories have been merged into one. In the case of the African fable, the tortoise gets back to earth safely but the birds decide to play him a return trick. A feast is provided on the ground but it is announced that this can only be eaten by those whose claws are clean. The birds fly to the river and return to alight on their food but the tortoise, having to crawl, gets its feet dirty in returning and is sent back to try again. This time it is he who misses the feast. A woodblock from Thomas North's translation of Bidpai, 1570 In a Sri Lankan continuation of the Indian version of the fable, Ibba the tortoise similarly survives its fall to earth, only to get into the clutches of Nariya, the hungry jackal. Ibba suggests to Nariya that its shell will become soft if it is soaked in the river. At first Nariya keeps a paw on the shell but then Ibba persuades him that he is soft all over except for the dry patch under Nariya's paw. When the jackal raises it, Ibba swims to safety. Other versions merge stories more seamlessly. A narration in the Uncle Remus tradition from the former slave population of South Carolina combines Aesop's fable of the discontented tortoise with an African cumulative tale. Brer Terrapin grumbles so much about being earth-bound that the animals conspire to have him carried up and dropped to his death. Miss Crow takes him first and when she grows tired he is transferred in turn to the back of a buzzard, a hawk and King Eagle. When the eagle will not listen to his pleas to take him back, the tortoise climbs down a thread he ties to the eagle's leg and so escapes his fate. Joseph Jacobs similarly combines both fables of Aesop in his late retelling Here the eagle is carrying the tortoise to a new home and is reminded by the crow that it is good to eat, whereupon the eagle drops it on a sharp rock and the two birds make a feast of it. This synthetic version and the moral given it, 'Never soar aloft on an enemy's pinions', is often mistaken as authentic nowadays.

The Clos Fourtet winery is located in the Right Bank of France's Bordeaux wine region in the commune of Saint-Émilion, in the department Gironde. The estate also produces the second wine Closerie de Fourtet. History Erected during the Middle Ages as a defensive fort, the property is situated opposite the main entrance to the old town of Saint-Émilion. Viticulture at what was then called Camfourtet (Camp Fourtet) began with the efforts of Léon Rulleau in the mid-18th century, who passed on the estate to his nephew Elie Rulleau who had the present château built. Records show that in 1789 the property was valued at 100,000 livres. The estate's name was altered to Clos Fourtet by the Rulleau family in 1868. Fernand Ginestet acquired the estate in 1919, in the same year that he purchased the Pomerol estate Château Petit-Village. In 1949 it was then sold by his son Pierre Ginestet in order to finance control of Château Margaux, and purchased by François Lurton. The Lurton family sold Clos Fourtet in 2001, reportedly for the sum of US$66.8 million. Currently the estate is owned by Philippe Cuvelier, also owner of Château Poujeaux, with the oenologist Stéphane Derenoncourt as consultant. Production The vineyard area extends to 19 hectares, with the grape varieties split between 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. 5,000 cases of the Grand vin Clos Fourtet are produced annually, while 2,500 cases of the second wine Closerie de Fourtet are usually produced.

During World War II he was Managing Director of the armaments firm British Manufacture and Research Co (BMARC), and from 1942-1950, he was the Member of Parliament for Grantham. In 1952 he emigrated to United States and set up American Manufacture and Research Co to build small diesel engines. Early life William Denis Kendall was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire. When he was fourteen, he ran away to sea and made £5,000--a huge sum at the time--helping police raid opium dens along China's Yangtze River before running a waterfront cabaret in Shanghai. He then relocated to the US as a steeplejack. Later, he went to work for a Philadelphia car plant and eventually became works manager for the Paris Citroen car factory. Career In 1938, Kendall went to Grantham, Lincolnshire, and became Managing Director of British Manufacture And Research Co (BMARC), which was set up by the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza and Lord Brownlow to manufacture aircraft cannon. Kendall became a member or affiliate of the British National Party (BNP). Kendall attracted the notice of the British security service for his Fascist sympathies, his suspected German links, his possible involvement in arms trafficking and his notorious indiscretion. By 1942, MI5 security service files describe him as a \\"larger than life\\" figure. He won the parliamentary seat of Grantham in a 1942 by- election when he defeated the National Government candidate by just 367 votes.Campbell, John The Grocer's Daughter When he won the by-election, the magazine Picture Post published a lengthy interview with accompanying action pictures and the eye-catching quote: \\"I won´t sit down and I won´t shut up\\". As the Managing Director for the British Manufacture and Research Company in Grantham, Kendall had controversial views on war production, which he took every opportunity to publicise. He learnt his engineering skills at car factories in the US and France. His factory was highly productive, where workers were well-paid and provided with endless music and dance parties. He hired an organ and cinema organist to entertain them. He retained the seat in July 1945 with an increased majority of 15,513. He developed plans to produce a \\"People's Car\\", and displayed a prototype outside Parliament in August 1945. A company, Grantham Productions, was set up to manufacture the car, and also agricultural tractors. He failed to secured adequate finance, despite the promise of funds from the Jamsahib of Nawanagar, India, and the company went into liquidation. The plans and tooling for the car were sold to Hartnett of Australia, and the tractor factory was sold to Newman Tractors. In August 1945 he also set up Grantham Publications, which published the weekly Grantham Guardian from November 1945 to December 1950. He was defeated in the 1950 General Election, and again in the 1951 General Election. In 1952, he moved to the US, and set up the American Manufacture and Research Co (American MARC) in Inglewood, California to produce small diesel engines. This was sold in 1961 and he then set up Dynapower Systems Corporation and Dynapower Medionics. National Archive files Three files available in the National Archives reveal that Kendall had come to the attention of the Security Service well- before his election. Shortly after his election, a reporter visiting his office saw that he had letters pinned up from Winston Churchill, King George VI and Lord Beaverbrook commending him for his part in the rescue of four people from a bombed house. However, the security files also showed how Beaverbrook, then Minister for Aircraft Production, had raised concerns about Kendall's activities. The file at the National Archives suggests real fears that Kendall planned to smuggle secret plans for a new 20mm aircraft cannon out of the UK to America. As a result of Beaverbrook's intervention, Kendall's letters were intercepted, as were those of his wife, Virginia. She despaired of his lavish lifestyle; and in one letter to a US friend, wrote: > \\"...[he] has completely lost his head... has one woman friend after > another... spends thousands on silver and diamonds... some day the British > people will want to know what is happening\\". The Security Service MI5, continued to watch his activities, and expressed concerns that he was carelessly revealing wartime production figures in his election hustings speeches in a way that breached the Official Secrets and the Defence of the Realm Acts. Kendall's popularity however, thwarted any attempt to arrest him. The files cover Kendall's election in 1942, including copies and summaries of his speeches. His victory was a surprise. He had initially been supported by the local Labour Party, which then withdrew support on orders from headquarters. A file minute of 14 September 1944 summarises the low opinion in which the Service held him > \\"The not very satisfactory Member of Parliament is said to boast that he can > get his own way on everything.\\" A copy of the Picture Post article featuring the interview is included in the National Archives files. The files go on to record speculation about his presumed post-war gun running and smuggling activities in India, the Netherlands and Palestine, involving Kendall's boat, which had a double hull for concealing illicit items. In 1949 a court ordered him to repay £15,000 provided by a private donor as an investment, but which he tried to use to pay off creditors. The security files also disclose that MI5 also kept close eyes on another company, Russian Oil Products, which was suspected of being a cover for Soviet espionage though Kendall's involvement, if any, is unclear. The company was sold to Regent Oil Company in 1948, the forebear of Texaco in the UK. Kendall lost his seat as an MP at the 1950 election. Interest in him appears to have declined after 1953. The files contain summary reports of his ongoing activities, and a career summary from 1950 concludes that > \\"during the war he was involved in the Black Market and there is in fact > little doubt that he is a currency smuggler\\". The files record his close association with leading right-wing extremists throughout. Other information ;Manthorpe News A article posted in the web site \\"Manthorpe News\\" has a picture of Clark Gable, Lord Brownlow and Kendall taken around 1943 with Gable in US Army uniform with the rank of Captain. The caption indicates that Gable was on a morale-boosting visit to Kendall's factory. The cutting is from the Grantham Journal, a newspaper still in publication. Gable was posted to RAF Polebrook in 1943, in Northamptonshire but not far from Grantham. The website also publishes a report headed \\"British MARCo military history of the second world war as seen by William Denis Kendall\\" (undated but presumably post-war) with the following quote: > [...] \\"About this time the Ministry of Aircraft Production came into being > headed by Lord Beaverbrook with Lord Brownlow being his Parliamentary > Private Secretary. All guns and shells were produced to equip our Spitfires > and Hurricane fighter planes[,] 4 cannons per plane. When world war2 [sic] > heated up and the bombing of Britain commenced, few people realised that my > factories were the most bombed in the country, and during the raids I lost > approximately 200 of my workpeople killed and wounded when their shelter > sustained a direct hit. I had a fine medical staff of three doctors and > thirty nurses out of a total 7,800 employees\\" [...] . Grantham was said to have received 21 raids by the Luftwaffe, which killed 70 people in 1941, around the Commercial Road area. This is in the town centre and north of Springfield Road where Kendall's factory was. ;Kendall's wife, Virginia The following posting was made by Anne Tracy’s brother, William Tracy, and his wife Lillian, of Portsmouth, OH, USA on this site: > Denis Kendall’s wife, Virginia, was my first cousin.

It has views of Slieve Donard, the highest peak in the Mourne Mountains and Dundrum Bay. Its 6,000-year-old sand dune system has been managed by the National Trust since 1967, when it became Ireland's first nature reserve. Grid ref: J414351. Features At 697 acres, it is the most extensive example of dune heath within Ireland, with a network of paths and boardwalks through the dunes. Breeding birds include meadow pipit, skylark, cuckoo, stonechat, linnet and reed bunting. Shorehauling grey seal and common seals are also common in the area. Between 50 and 130 common and grey seals regularly use the area for moulting, resting and feeding. Rare plants local to the site are pyramidal orchid and carline thistle. It also has access to a shingle beach and four mile Blue Flag strand. Murlough makes up one fifth of all dune heathland in the British Isles, but remains under threat from the encroachment of scrub vegetation such as bracken and gorse and non- native species such as Sea Buckthorn. In 1999 the National Trust established the South Down Heathland project, a five-year programme to protect the habitat. It has been designated an Area of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. History The area has evidence of human habitation from Neolithic times, through the Bronze Age to the present day. In the 12th century a rabbit warren was established on the site by the Normans for their meat and pelts. This had a major influence on the development of the heath and grassland found today. A particularly stormy period in the 13th and 14th centuries resulted in a huge movement of sand which led to the unusually high dunes also found today. The sand dunes were extensively used by the US Army during the Second World War. Moths and butterflies Several rare moths and butterflies can be found within the reserve. Of the 23 butterfly species recorded at Murlough, the marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia), is of European importance - other notable species include dark-green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), grayling (Hipparchia semele) and cryptic wood white (Leptidea juvernica). One species, the wall brown butterfly (Lasiommata megera) has not been recorded for several years and is considered extinct at this site. Over 750 species of moth have been recorded within the boundary of Murlough Nature Reserve, more than at any other site in Northern Ireland - examples include small elephant hawkmoth (Deilephila porcellus), sand dart (Agrotis ripae) and the micro moths Pyrausta cingulata and Hysterophora maculosana. A total of 775 Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) have been recorded within the nature reserve boundary. Notable migrant species noted in the area have included: cosmopolitan (Leucania loreyi), tawny pinion (Lithophane semibrunnea), double line (Mythimna turca), white-speck, the delicate and L-album wainscot In 2012 a Stephens' gem (Megalographa biloba) was recorded at Murlough NNR - this was the 1st record for Ireland of this North American moth species.

SEACOM is privately owned and operated. Cable structure and technology cross section of the shore-end of a modern submarine communications cable. 1 – Polyethylene2 – Mylar tape 3 – Stranded steel wires4 – Aluminium water barrier 5 – Polycarbonate6 – Copper or aluminium tube 7 – Petroleum jelly8 – Optical fibers Fibre-optic pairs are provided from Mtunzini to France to a point of presence (PoP) in Marseille, as well as from Tanzania to India into a PoP in Mumbai. SEACOM has also built an on-net European network, managed and operated by themselves, to deliver transport layer, internet protocol (IP), and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) services from Africa to the following cities in Europe, and vice versa: * Amsterdam, Netherlands * Frankfurt, Germany * London, United Kingdom * Marseille, France * Slough, United Kingdom Through third-party networks in Europe, SEACOM also delivers these services to other locations in Europe not covered in the list of cities above. The SEACOM cable is deployed with a mixture of double armour cable, single armour cable, special protection cable (with a metallic wrap below the insulator, rather than steel wires), and lightweight cable without armour, used in deep waters. Shallower water cable typically has more protective armour than offshore, deeper cable. The cable is a loose tube design that determines the amount and relative location along the transmission path of each type of fibre. Multiple fibre types are used in the cable: dispersion-shifted and non-zero dispersion- shifted. The repeaters are optical amplifier repeaters, using erbium-doped amplifiers. There are over 150 repeaters in the SEACOM system. They are spaced along the cable many tens of kilometres apart with the distance between repeaters varying depending on the segment in the system. Repeater spacing is determined by a variety of factors, including the transmission capacity of the fibres in the cable and the distance between cable landing points. On 23 July 2009, the cable began operations, providing the eastern and southern African countries of Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and South Africa with high-speed Internet connectivity to Europe and Asia. The cable was officially switched on in simultaneous events held across the region, in Mombasa, Kenya, and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. On 4 August 2020, SEACOM announced that it would more than double the capacity on its fibre-optic network by the end of August 2020. The continent’s first broadband submarine cable system operator will add 1.7Tbit/s to its network, bringing its total capacity to 3.2Tbit/s along Africa’s eastern and Southern coasts. Project funding SEACOM is privately- funded, and approximately 75% African-owned. Initial private investment in the SEACOM project was US$375 million: $75 million from the developers, $150 million from private South African investors, and $75 million as a commercial loan from Nedbank (South Africa). The remaining $75 million was provided by Industrial Promotion Services (IPS), which is the industrial and infrastructure arm of the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development. The IPS investment was funded by $15 million in equity, and a total of $60.4 million in debt from the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund and the FMO.Investment structure Current ownership structure is as follows: 30% IPS, 30% Remgro, 15% Sanlam, 15% Convergence Partners, and 10% by Brian Herlihy. The cable is variously described as a $600 and a $650 million project, and has seen a number of upgrades to landing station infrastructure, national backhaul and increases to carrying capacity, with an increase to 2.6 terabits per second (Tbit/s) in May 2012,Seacom upgrades and then to 12 Tbit/s in 2014.

The eastern third, outside the dyke at Avdebo, is still sea, but the name Lammefjorden now usually refers only to the dry part west of the dyke. The sandy former sea bed is excellent agricultural land, especially for crops such as carrots and potatoes. The draining project began in 1873, but it took until 1943 before the lowest elevations were pumped dry. Large parts of the fjord were shallow enough to be dry early on. In 1899 the Odsherred Railway opened across the western end of the fjord. The town of Fårevejle Stationsby grew up where the railway intersects that main road across the seabed; it serves as the administrative and mercantile center for much of the Lammefjord.

Its goal is to promote philately and philatelic studies. The Académie's headquarters is hosted in La Poste's Museum in Paris, a postal museum the association fought for in the 1930s. Part of the museum library, open to the public, is a loan of the Académie. The Académie's emblem is the Ceres head designed by Jacques-Jean Barre for the first postage stamp of France. History On 25 May 1928, Gaston Tournier, editor-in-chief of Le Messager philatélie, launched the project of an academy whose members would be important and recognized philatelists. The magazine's readers were invited to elect the 25 founding members, without any list be proposed. On 19 December 1928, took place the inaugural setting of the . The 25 elected members adopted the rules to become a member: the forty full members (') would be French nationals and chosen by the sitting full members. Thirty foreign members (') are created too. In the following years, a member has to be a corresponding member (') to pretend for full membership. Members are named for a lifelong tenure, but those who want to retire because they do no more have enough time can be appointed the title of honorary member ('). The main public actions of the Académie was to militate for the creation of a French postal museum and to help constitute its collections and library. Activities During its private regular sessions, the members of the Académie de philatélie organise philatelic and marcophilic conferences. Since 1959, the Académie edits a trimestrial revue, Documents philatéliques filled by its members. In 1968, the first two tomes of an Encyclopédie du timbre-poste was published. Each year, if the Académie recognizes enough merits, philatelists non-members of the Académie can be awarded in three main domains:Awards on the Académie's website. * literary (since 1930) for the best philatelic book of the year, * philatelic (since 2001) for the best philatelic exhibition saw at the Fédération française des associations philatéliques Congress' national exhibit,Despite the annual public conference of the Académie being organized during the FFAP congress, the Académie is not a member of the French Philatelic Associations Federation. * internet (since 2001) for the best philatelic website.

It aired on Saturday nights in the 9:00–9:54 p.m. time slot on the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) network from May 24, 1975 to April 3, 1982. A sequel, G-Men '82, followed, as did the specials. It had also been broadcast in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Since Hong Kong was one of the filming locations, it was very popular there. With several updates and cast changes, it ran for 7 years. Selected episodes are available on DVD.  Plot  The story revolved around a special detective agency, the eponymous G-Men. The principal character, who spanned the entire series (and continued into the sequel and specials), was Superintendent Tetsuya Kuroki, who was portrayed by Tetsurō Tamba. Kuroki directed the members of the group. The original cast also included Yasuaki Kurata as Detective Yasuaki Kusano, trained in karate. Gō Wakabayashi joined in Episode 105, and remained to the end of the series (and the sequel). His character, Lieutenant Goro Tachibana, replaced a detective who was written out of the script.  Music  Shunsuke Kikuchi wrote the opening theme songs. Various artists, including some cast members, wrote and performed the closing songs. For most years, the lyrics were by Junya Sato, set to Kikuchi's music. Veteran announcer Takayuki Akutagawa narrated the series. Opening sequence The opening sequence featured the main cast walking along a runway with a \\"75\\" placed at the bottom, with an arrow beside it, as their characters were viewed in separate close-ups (with the name of their actors accompanying). The placement of the arrow and the \\"75\\" logo were changed as the series progressed.

Sign at the eastern mouth of the railway tunnel The Arlberg Railway Tunnel () forms the central part of the Arlberg railway in western Austria, running between the federal states Tyrol and Vorarlberg. It traverses through the Arlberg massif at the northeastern end of the Rhaetian Alps. First opened to traffic in 1884, it was a major engineering achievement of the nation, being the longest railway tunnel in Austria for over 100 years, possessing a length of . Originally operated by steam locomotives, the Arlberg Railway Tunnel was reengineered during the 1920s for use by electric traction. During the 2010s, further modifications were implemented to introduce improved safety levels and expand the loading gauge. It is interconnected with the later-built Arlberg Road Tunnel. History The origins of the Arlberg Railway Tunnel is closely associated with the Arlberg railway, of which construction commenced immediately after receiving authorisation to proceed on 16 May 1880. Built at a total cost of 35.5 million gulden, the line had been approved as a single-track railway throughout much of its length; however, the Arlberg tunnel was intentionally constructed with sufficient space to accommodate a double track arrangement from the onset, engineers having anticipated the need to handle higher volumes of traffic than a single line would be able to convey. A large proportion of the Arlberg Railway Tunnel, akin to much of the line's engineered features, comprised natural stone masonry in its construction, using materials such as limestone, gneiss, and mica schist. The Arlberg Railway Tunnel was a major engineering feature of the line; possessing a length of 10,648 meters, it was the longest railway tunnel in Austria, and would remain so for over one hundred years. On 21 December 1884, it was opened as a single-track tunnel, and rapidly became saturated by heavy traffic. Accordingly, the second parallel track was installed and operational by 15 July 1885. The tunnel starts at near the railway station serving St. Anton am Arlberg and ends in Langen am Arlberg. Early on, operations became troubled by the tunnel's lack of ventilation; the combination of steam locomotives and inadequate air flow led to dangerous sulphuric acid vapour accumulating along the roof, which compelled locomotive crews to lie on the floor seeking fresher air to breath. While protective equipment was issued to the crews, the problem was not truly eliminated until the introduction of electric traction during the 1920s. During the 1970s, the interconnecting Arlberg Road Tunnel was built alongside the earlier railway tunnel, there is a minimum distance of 150 distances between the actively- trafficked bores. For over 125 years, the tunnel has functioned as the only railway connection between the two Austrian provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg; making it a critical piece of infrastructure for the Austrian Federal Railways. Up to 90 trains per day were reportedly using the route on busy days by 2009, resulting in several million tonnes of freight traversing the tunnel during a single year. During the early twenty-first century, the Austrian Federal Railways began to reengineer elements of the Arlberg line with contemporary safety features. As such, the Arlberg Railway Tunnel was subject to a package of works costing 210 million euros during a temporary closure, this included the addition of eight new evacuation and rescue passaged between it and the adjacent Arlberg Road Tunnel; other safety-related changes included a water supply (for fire-fighting purposes), new orientation lighting, emergency telephone and radio facilities, and overhead line disconnection functionality. These alterations were tempered by a desire to keep the existing tunnel structure relatively intact, avoiding lengthy interruptions to operations; however, the safety measures introduced maintained compliance with existing guidelines and knowhow. Furthermore, the loading gauge throughout the tunnel was expanded by lowering the track bed, while a permanent road surface was also added so that emergency vehicles could more readily move inside as well; the renovated tunnel was put back into service during late 2010.

Overview Aesthetically and politically, Lovework descends from a mid-'90s school of conscious Northwest hip hop, characterized by groups such as Black Anger and Silent Lambs Project. It was a time where the Seattle sound became jazzier—more melodic, intricate, and atmospheric. It turned away from the gangsta themes and beats that dominated the period and instead focused on progressive politics, utopian aspirations, and an organic connection with black Africa. Lovework was produced by Amos Miller with additional beat contributions from Sabzi (of Blue Scholars), Moka Only, Kitone, and Specs One – its sound was primarily influenced by Seattle veteran Vitamin D (who also mixed the record) and the late J Dilla.\\"Let 'Lovework' Rule\\" by Charles Mudede.

The Manvers Street bus station opened in 1958 and operated until 2009 when it was replaced by the new bus station in Dorchester Street as part of the Southgate regeneration programme. History The old Bath Bus Station in 2006 The old Bath Bus Station at Manvers Street opened in 1958 under the control of the Bristol Omnibus Company.Curtis, C and Walker, M (2007) Bristol Omnibus Services: The Green Years Millstream Books The Southgate area of the city between Manvers Street to the east and St James’ Parade to the west was the area worst affected by the Baedeker Blitz of April 1942. The bus station was built as part of a project to replace this area of the city, where the city's main railway station, connecting Bath with Bristol and London was already situated. The bus station was located next to the city's red brick Victorian dairy, which showed lasting evidence of shell damage from the bombings. In this process, many of the city's older buildings and streets were destroyed to make way for not just the bus station, but also the Southgate Shopping Centre and accompanying Ham Gardens car park. The demolition of this maze of historical buildings was known as the Rape of Bath and was finally halted in the early 1960s due to public outcry. The city has since been designated a world heritage site and 95% of the buildings in the centre are protected by listed building status. The new development was seen as being a threat to the city's World Heritage Status. The bus station operated a range of services during its 49-year history – including local city buses, country buses, National Express coach services and Open top bus Tours. It has seen the Labour nationalisation and the Conservative privatisation of public transport, and the morphing of Bristol Omnibus into Badgerline, which was acquired by FirstGroup and rebranded as First Somerset & Avon.Competition Commission report 1989 para 4.4; Curtis & Walker, p.222 New bus station New Bath bus station The Manvers Street Bus Station was scheduled to be demolished as part of the next Southgate regeneration programme for nearly 20 years. During this time, the building was owned by the local council and leased to First. Neither party was prepared to improve or repair the fabric of the building, as it was expected to be demolished. However, the redevelopment was plagued with controversy and continual demands for reviews, so the project did not get under way until early 2007, with the appointment of new contractors. The bus station was finally demolished in July 2007. Operations for First Somerset & Avon moved to a temporary site constructed on the Avon Street Car Park on 16 June 2007. This was provided by contractors Sir Robert McAlpine as part of a move to speed up completion of the entire Southgate project by one year. A new location for the bus station was chosen on the site of Churchill House – an abandoned 1920s electricity company building, the demolition of which sparked the most recent controversy to delay the whole project. Campaigners fighting for the preservation of the building argued that the frontage from Churchill House should be retained and incorporated into the design of the new bus station, but the architects maintained that this was not practical. Revised plans for a glass and metal rotunda - nicknamed derisively by local people as the \\"Busometer\\" \\\\- on the site close to Bath Spa railway station and on the edge of the River Avon were given council approval in early 2007 and work begun to construct this part of the transport interchange for the city. The new Bath Bus Station opened on Sunday 7 June 2009, at a cost of £14 million, as part of the £360 million SouthGate development.

ACARE was launched at the Paris Airshow in June 2001 and has about 40 members. Overview In the year 2000 the Belgian European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, Philippe Busquin, invited a number of aviation industry leaders to produce a strategy detailing how the European Commission could help Europe's aviation industry become more competitive. This ‘Group of Personalities’ published ‘’European Aeronautics: A Vision for 2020’’ in January 2001. The document recommended the creation of ACARE, which would define the content of a long- term strategy to create a coherent European aviation research network. This network would bring together industry leaders, government actors from the member states of the European Union, and the European Commission. Following the publication of ACARE's ‘’Strategic Research Agenda’’, the Commission launched a number of aeronautical research bodies and initiatives as part of the 6th and 7th Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development and the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. Prominent examples of these include the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking, a public-private partnership coordinating and funding research projects that aim to mitigate the environmental impact of aviation by developing more fuel-efficient technologies, and the SESAR Joint Undertaking, which aims to improve the efficiency of the European air traffic management system.

Biography Matej Bor was born as Vladimir Pavšič in the village of Grgar near Gorizia, in what was then the Austrian County of Gorizia and Gradisca and is today part of the Slovenian municipality of Nova Gorica. After the Italian annexation of the Julian March in 1920, the family moved to Celje, which was then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. After finishing his studies at the Celje High School, Vladimir enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied Slovene and Slavic philology. After graduation, he worked as a journalist and professor in Maribor. When the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in April 1941, he escaped from Nazi-occupied Maribor to the Italian-occupied Province of Ljubljana. In the summer of the same year he joined the Communist-led partisan resistance, where he worked in the area of culture and propaganda. During the People's Liberation War he emerged as one of the major poets of the Slovene resistance. Several of his battle songs became hugely popular. One of them, Hey, Brigades, became the unofficial anthem of Slovene partisan forces during World War II. It was during this period that he started to use the pseudonym Matej Bor, which he continued to use also after the war. In 1944, he moved to Belgrade which had just been liberated by the Yugoslav partisans. There he worked at the Slovene section of Radio Free Yugoslavia, led by Boris Ziherl. Among his colleagues in Belgrade were the authors Igo Gruden, Edvard Kocbek and Anton Ingolič. In 1945 he moved back to Ljubljana, where he dedicated himself to writing and translating. He received the highest recognition for cultural achievements in Slovenia, the Prešeren Award in 1947 and again in 1952. In 1965 he became a member of the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts. In the 1960s and 1970s he was the president of the Slovenian section of the International P.E.N.. During the period of Yugoslavia, he often used his influence to help dissidents or to sponsor causes challenging official policies. In the 1960s, he publicly criticized the imprisonment of the Serbian dissident writer Mihajlo Mihajlov. He was one of the founders of the environmentalist movements in Slovenia in the early 1970s. He also voiced his support for the heritage protection movement which fought against the demolishing of historic buildings in Ljubljana (such as the Kozler's Palace). In the late 1970s and early 1980s he led the platform for the rehabilitation of the victims of Stalinist show trials in Slovenia (the so-called Dachau trials of 1947). In 1984 he helped the writer Igor Torkar to publish a novel on his experiences in the Goli Otok concentration camp. In the 1980s Bor researched and attempted to translate Venetic inscriptions by using Slovene and its dialects. Together with Jožko Šavli and Ivan Tomažič, he advocated the theory of the Venetic origins of Slovenes, claiming that the Slovenes are the descendants of a pre-Roman Slavic-speaking people called the Veneti. None of the three men were linguists, and the theory was soon rejected by scholars, but launched a long controversy in which Bor played a prominent role. He died in Ljubljana.  Work  Bor published a number of poetry collections. His first collection, called Previharimo viharje, was published during the anti-fascist resistance fight in 1942 by an underground publishing house. In 1959 he published the book Šel je popotnik skozi atomski vek (A Wanderer Went Through the Atom Age), an apocalyptic poetic reflection on the environmental disasters in the Atomic Age. The book was republished in several editions and was translated into the major European languages and contributed to Bor's popularity outside Yugoslavia. Bor also wrote twelve plays and a number of literary works for children and youth. He was a regular contributor to publications for children and teenagers such as Ciciban, Pionir, Pionirski list, Najdihojca (a supplement of the journal Delo), Mali Rod (Klagenfurt) and The Voice of Youth (Chicago). He also wrote the screenplay for the film Vesna, which was released in 1954.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY-2ZJ-bhAY He translated a number of works by Shakespeare into Slovene.

The PvhN seeks a separate Parliament for these 3 northern provinces, and for 25% of the country's profits from natural gas to go directly to them. Elections Since 11 March 2003 the PvhN has had two seats on the States-Provincial of Groningen, and (since 6 March 2006) one seat on the city council of Delfzijl. In the States-Provincial elections of 7 March 2007 the Party remained stable, getting 3.6% of the vote and being reduced from 2 to 1 seat in Groningen due to the reduction in the total number of seats in each States-Provincial. In Friesland and Drenthe, where the party fought for the first time in the 2007 elections, it won no seats that year. In the Senate the Party for the North has allied with the Independent Senate Group (OSF). The OSF has won one seat in the Senate, by Henk ten Hoeve at Stiens. European Parliament In 2004 the party participated in the elections for the European Parliament. The party obtained 18,234 votes (0.4% of the vote overall, though this rose to 4-5% of the vote in some northern municipalities), not enough for a seat. City councils In the March 2006 city-council (Gemeenteraad) elections, the PvhN for the first time contested in three cities (Groningen, Delfzijl and Emmen). In Delfzijl the party won one seat.

Prior to her military service, she was a luxury ocean liner named SS Washington. Washington was launched in May 1933 by the New York Shipbuilding Company of Camden, New Jersey, and operated as a passenger liner from New York City to Plymouth, England, and Hamburg, Germany. Renamed Mount Vernon 6 June 1941, the liner was acquired by the Navy 16 June 1941 and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard the same day, Captain Donald B. Beary in command. Converted for naval use by Philadelphia Navy Yard, Mount Vernon trained along the east coast while mounting tension in the Far East drew the United States toward participation in World War II. In the fall, the new transport joined a convoy at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and sailed for Cape Town, South Africa. As Mount Vernon steamed toward Cape of Good Hope, word arrived that Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor. A member of the crew reported that the Mt. Vernon was at Singapore on December 7, 1941 and ordered out, due to intelligence from the British that an attack was imminent. On that side of the date line December 8, was the day the war began. This was said to be classified \\"Top Secret\\" and that the Cape Horn Story was a cover. The Mt. Vernon was a fast converted liner and did not travel with convoys, at their slower speeds. The crew feared sub attacks because, they traveled alone and did not zig zag much. A machinist mate on the crew disclosed this in the 1970s. However several reliable accounts including those of the soldiers on board confirm that the Mount Vernon was indeed part of the convoy known as William Sail 12x which sailed from Halifax, via Trinidad, and put in at Cape Town two days after the Pearl Harbor attack.http://www.britain-at- war.org.uk/WW2/Convoy_William_Sail_12x/html/detailed_account.htm They had been due to sail up the east coast of Africa headed for the conflict in the Middle East. But when Pearl Harbor happened, they changed plans and headed to Singapore. The William Sail 12x convoy was a response to Churchill's request to Roosevelt for help, and it is interesting that the troop carrying ships that made up the convoy, such as the USS Mount Vernon (AP-22) and USS West Point (AP-23), were already converted from their civilian roles as passenger liners in advance of the Pearl Harbor attacks. World War II The transport, part of convoy DM.1, reached Singapore 13 January 1942. Here she debarked British and Canadian troops, watched dogfights between Japanese and British planes over the city, and underwent an air attack before sailing 16 January for Aden, where she embarked Australian veterans of the Mediterranean Theatre for transportation to Ceylon and Fremantle. Mount Vernon was the lead ship in Operation Stepsister, the movement of Australian troops from North Africa and the Middle East to Southeast Asia, the Dutch East Indies and Australia in response to war in the Pacific, and was carrying 4,668 of those troops in waters south of the Dutch East Indies even as allied naval forces were withdrawing in the face of Japanese attacks. On 9 March Mount Vernon delivered the returning Australian Imperial Force (A.I.F.) troops to Adelaide. In Australia she embarked civilian and military escapees from the Philippines, and naval survivors from ships sunk in the Battle of Makassar Strait. After calls in Adelaide, South Australia and Wellington, New Zealand, Mount Vernon sailed for San Francisco, arriving 31 March. For the next two years, Mount Vernon plied from San Francisco to ports in Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Hawaii, carrying the soldiers, marines, and sailors who would build the bases, then fight from them, bringing the ultimate victory over Japan. Her last such voyage began from San Francisco 21 February 1944. Steaming via Melbourne, she proceeded to Bombay, India, to debark Army personnel. She returned to Melbourne, and sailed for Boston by way of the Panama Canal, arriving 22 May. On 4 June 1944, Mount Vernon began a series of voyages to British Isles ports and the Mediterranean, carrying men for the massive buildup on the European continent which would bring Germany to her knees. Her crossings continued after the war, as she carried occupation troops over and brought veterans home. Decommissioning Returning from the last voyage 3 January 1946, Mount Vernon decommissioned 18 January 1946, was delivered to the Maritime Commission, and again named Washington. She was struck from the Naval Register in 1959 and sold for scrap in 1965.

It is a requirement for both the free electron model and the nearly-free electron model, where it is used alongside Bloch's theorem. In quantum mechanics, this approximation is often used to simplify a quantum many-body problem into single-particle approximations. While this simplification holds for many systems, electron-electron interactions may be very important for certain properties in materials. For example, the theory covering much of superconductivity is BCS theory, in which the attraction of pairs of electrons to each other, termed \\"Cooper pairs\\", is the mechanism behind superconductivity. One major effect of electron-electron interactions is that electrons distribute around the ions so that they screen the ions in the lattice from other electrons.  Quantum treatment  For an example of the Independent electron approximation's usefulness in quantum mechanics, consider an N-atom crystal with one free electron per atom (each with atomic number Z). Neglecting spin, the Hamiltonian of the system takes the form: :\\\\mathcal{H} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\left( \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^2 abla_i^2}{2m_e} - \\\\sum_{I=0}^{N}\\\\frac{e^2Z}{\\\\left \\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}_I \\\\right |} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i eq j}^{N}\\\\frac{e^2}{\\\\left \\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j \\\\right |} \\\\right ) , where \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck's constant, e is he elementary charge, me is the electron rest mass, and abla_i is the gradient operator for electron i. The capitalized \\\\mathbf{R}_I is the I-th lattice location (the equilibrium position of the I-th nuclei) and the lowercase \\\\mathbf{r}_i is the i-th electron position. The first term in parentheses is called the kinetic energy operator while the last two are simply the Coulomb interaction terms for electron-nucleus and electron-electron interactions, respectively. If the electron-electron term were negligible, the Hamiltonian could be decomposed into a set of N decoupled Hamiltonians (one for each electron), which greatly simplifies analysis. The electron-electron interaction term, however, prevents this decomposition by ensuring that the Hamiltonian for each electron will include terms for the position of every other electron in the system. If the electron-electron interaction term is sufficiently small, however, the Coulomb interactions terms can be approximated by an effective potential term, which neglects electron-electron interactions. This is known as the independent electron approximation. Bloch's theorem relies on this approximation by setting the effective potential term to a periodic potential of the form V(\\\\mathbf{r}) which satisfies V(\\\\mathbf{r} + \\\\mathbf{R}_j) = V(\\\\mathbf{r}), where \\\\mathbf{R}_j is any reciprocal lattice vector (see Bloch's theorem). This approximation can be formalized using methods from the Hartree-Fock approximation or density functional theory.  See also  * Strongly correlated material  References  * Omar, M. Ali (1994).

It consists of four short stories: the titular story revolves around a boy who assumes the role of his deceased, rockstar twin, while \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" focuses on a girl who wins a trip to Los Angeles and finds herself entangled in a plot to steal an inheritance. \\"Orange Time Bomb\\" deals with the interpersonal struggles of the members of the band Orange Bombs, and its sequel, \\"Tokyo Top,\\" focuses on the band's singer pursuing an acting career and the love triangle that ensues among the actors. The concept and characters for \\"Kaine\\" came together within a day, although page limitations later affected a few scenes and some character development. Yuki later expressed embarrassment at including \\"Orange Time Bomb,\\" \\"Tokyo Top,\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" with \\"Kaine\\" because of their relative age: the three stories had variously appeared in the Japanese manga magazine Hana to Yume and its sister magazine Bessatsu Hana to Yume from 1988 to 1990, while \\"Kaine\\" had been a two-part serial in Hana to Yume in 1996. Nevertheless, publishing company Hakusensha later compiled the four stories into a bound volume and published it in October 1996; a re-release followed in September 2009. The collection has been translated into other languages, including French, Italian, and German. Critics generally enjoyed \\"Kaine\\" for its rock- music-inspired storyline, while the other three stories were seen as interesting for their status as works from the beginning of her career. Plot \\"Kaine\\" follows Shinogu, the unassuming twin brother of the titular rockstar. Upon awakening, Shinogu discovers that the car accident that left him comatose killed Kaine, and he is thus forced by Kaine's manager, Oda, to assume Kaine's identity as a way for them to recoup the considerable costs associated with covering up Kaine's scandals. Shinogu comes to suspect that his twin was murdered, and with the help of Kaine's guitarist and high-school friend Die, he discovers that the band's success came not from hard work or talent, but a high induced in listeners by a secret message encoded in the CD, which eventually leads to suicide. The pair takes Oda to task over this revelation, and Shinogu agrees to one final concert for his brother's memory. Oda, however, schemes to have the two murdered to protect the company. Narrowly avoiding death, Die rescues Shinogu on stage, which triggers his repressed memories: \\"Shinogu\\" realizes that he has been Kaine the entire time. Unable to cope with his destructive upbringing and the demands of fame, he conspired to switch places with his twin, whom he envied for his carefree and innocent nature. Although Kaine was unable to go through with his plans to murder his twin, Shinogu died in the ensuing car accident and Kaine's body was mistaken for his. Kaine, finally remembering his past, then shoots himself on stage to Die's horror. The story ends with Kaine awakening in the hospital again to Die's presence: Die affirms that his past as Kaine was only a nightmare, while privately despairing that Kaine has always been able to control him. \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" centers on Saya Morikawa, a teenager who wins a trip to Los Angeles, California. Together with her guide, Minobu Kishida, she stays at the home of Takako Tojo, the company president's widow. There, Saya is troubled by warnings from a mysterious woman and is repeatedly mistaken for Takako's absent daughter, Shoko. As the story progresses, it is revealed that Minobu and Takako conspired to kill Shoko, who had inherited all of her father's property. When they failed to find her corpse to use as proof of her death, they then decided to kill Saya and substitute her corpse instead. Plagued by guilt, Minobu rescues Saya, and Shoko confronts them, having enlisted Saya's help. Takako and Minobu are arrested, and Saya returns to Japan, dreaming of her return to Los Angeles and all the sightseeing to do there. \\"Orange Time Bomb\\" opens with Jam, a young girl who has collided with Tatsumi, the teenage guitarist and lyricist of the band Orange Bombs. In accidentally knocking off his sunglasses, she discovers his secret: without them, he blushes in the presence of women. While Tatsumi and Guy clash over their shared workload, Jam eventually tracks Tatsumi down and threatens to reveal his secret unless he goes out with her. They eventually bond over shared memories of their pasts, and later on, Guy embraces Jam, wishing to break the two of them apart; in doing so, he is photographed by a paparazzo. Guy and Tatsumi reconcile over their efforts to obtain the camera, which is eventually destroyed. \\"Tokyo Top,\\" the sequel short story of \\"Orange Time Bomb,\\" follows Guy as he acts alongside with Satsuki, a headstrong singer, on the set of a science-fiction film. Satsuki ends up in a love triangle with Guy and another actor, the womanizing, arrogant Ibe. When she learns about Ibe's scheme to have Guy beaten up during the filming of a scene, she rushes to intercede, fighting off his attackers. She confesses her love for him and her fears that he could never love her because she is strong-willed. The story closes with them attending a screening together. Development and publication The concept and characters for \\"Kaine\\" came together within a day. Due to page limitations and deadlines, manga artist Kaori Yuki was unable to flesh out some of the characters, something she regretted in the afterword. She thought that, because of this, some characters were unintentionally comedic. She also noted how the page limitations affected the scenes where Kaine escapes being murdered by Oda or when he sings at the concert in the climax. Die was her favorite character to draw, and in the original ending, she had intended for him to go mad. Although she visited a music studio to gather impressions for \\"Kaine,\\" she did not use any of them, nor did she use a model for any of the characters. Yuki expressed her embarrassment at including the other three stories within the collection, due to their status as very early works. In her retrospective on \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" she thought that the art was \\"amateurish.\\" \\"Orange Time Bomb\\" is from the early point in her career when she wrote romantic-comedy manga. She had been having difficulty selling her manga stories, and an older colleague had advised her that she would not be successful with the particular stories and illustrations she had been pursuing. She then switched genres to romantic comedy, and although she had a few stories published, she was unhappy. It was not until she wrote a \\"dark, scary\\" miniseries with increasingly favorable reader responses that her editor told her to pursue similar stories. Her success with the next manga she wrote, The Cain Saga, convinced her that \\"dark\\" stories and the Gothic genre were most suitable for her style and potential. At the time she was writing \\"Tokyo Top,\\" she was into European rock music and took inspiration from that. Cultural references to films and music can be found within the short story collection: the title of \\"Tokyo Top\\" comes from the film Tokyo Pop (1988), and visual allusions to The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1976) appear near the manga's ending. Additionally, the title of \\"Orange Time Bomb\\" has been suggested to be an allusion to the novel A Clockwork Orange (1962) and its related film, while \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" might be a reference to the Beatles album of the same name (1967). \\"Tokyo Top\\" appeared in the first issue of the Japanese manga magazine Hana to Yume for 1989, while \\"Orange Time Bomb\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" were published in its sister manga magazine Bessatsu Hana to Yume in 1988 and 1990, respectively. \\"Kaine\\" was serialized in the sixth and seventh issues of Hana to Yume in 1996. The stories were compiled into a bound volume by Hakusensha and published on 18 October 1996. It was later republished on 15 September 2009. It has been translated into other languages, including French by Tonkam, Italian by Panini Comics, and German by Carlsen Comics. Reception Critics generally singled out \\"Kaine\\" as the highlight of the collection, citing the intriguing narrative centered around rock music. One reviewer for Manga Sanctuary remarked that, despite the lack of depth in some characters, \\"Kaine\\" was among some of Yuki's best manga, complemented by her artwork and a \\"sublime ending.\\" Planete BDs Faustine Lillaz enjoyed the story's premise, art, and character designs, but wrote that the resulting plot was unnecessarily convoluted and would have benefited from more pages to fully flesh the events out. Conversely, the other reviewer for Manga Sanctuary interpreted the narrative of Kaine as a cliché-filled caricature with art that, while better than the majority of other shōjo manga, was serviceable. The other three stories received a range of reactions, with their age relative to \\"Kaine\\" often remarked upon.

Its mission was to look for suitable locations for a fort, find a route to the southwest, and to investigate the possibility of gold mining. Custer and his unit, the 7th Cavalry, arrived in the Black Hills on July 22, 1874, with orders to return by August 30. The expedition set up a camp at the site of the future town of Custer; while Custer and the military units searched for a suitable location for a fort, civilians searched for gold, and it is disputed whether or not any substantial amount was found. Nonetheless, this prompted a mass gold rush which in turn antagonised the Sioux Indians who had been promised protection of their sacred land through Treaties made by the US government,Black Hills of Dakota at Spartacus Online retrieved March 4, 2008 and who were later to kill Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in the Great Sioux War of 1876–1877 between themselves and the United States.Overview and History of the 1874 Black Hills at Custer's Trail retrieved March 4, 2008 The entire expedition was photographed by William H. Illingworth, an English photographer who accompanied Custer after selection by the then-Captain William Ludlow. Ludlow, the engineer for the expedition, financed Illingworth's photography and paid him $30 per month to provide photographic plates for the US Army, of which he made 70 in all. Expedition =Embarking for the Black Hills= Custer's wagon train passing through Castle Creek valley, by William H. Illingworth Custer embarked on his expedition with 1000-1200 men, in 110 wagons with numerous horses and cattle of the 7th Cavalry, along with artillery and two months food supply.Cozzens, p. 176. The expedition also took a number of Native American scouts led by Bloody Knife and Lean Bear.Cozzen, p. 179. At the time, the Black Hills were relatively unknown, with few white expeditions ever returning from them The commander of Custer's engineering corps, Captain Hardy, assured him that he had heard of them and had them marked on his maps, but had never entered them during his earlier expeditions. En route to the Black Hills, Custer's party managed to locate the track of Hardy's group when they spotted two lines of sunflowers that had grown along the ruts of his passing wagons. Custer and his force entered the Black Hills from the north, travelling south at a slow pace of no more than four or five miles a day on some occasions. On July 31, 1874, the wagon train reached Harney Peak (now Black Elk Peak), and Custer together with Ludlow took three or four men to climb it.Cozzens, p. 177. In the meantime, the rest of the expedition made camp at the mountain's base at the newly named Custer Park.Cozzens, p. 164. While the majority of the force remained there, Custer took a small unit with him to locate a suitable site for a new fort. By August 2, 1874 this force had reached a point eight and a half miles south-east of the mountain,Cozzens, p. 159. to a location they named Agnes Park, having had a number of peaceful encounters with Native American settlements.Cozzens, p. 159-161. On August 7 Custer shot and killed a grizzly bear, forever claiming this to be his greatest achievement as a hunter.Hatch, p. 147. =Discovery of gold= The bear Custer shot and later said to be his greatest hunting achievement Throughout the expedition, civilian experts who accompanied the expedition located traces of gold in the rivers. The first discovery goes uncredited, however an undated diary entry by William McKay, a miner accompanying the expedition, notes that while camping at the newly named Custer Park, \\"In the evening I took a pan, pick and shovel, and went out prospecting. The first panful was taken from the gravel and sand obtained in the bed of the creek; and on washing was found to contain from one and a half to two cents, which was the first gold found in the Black Hills.\\"Hatch, p. 146. A significant discovery was made on August 1 when tests of the soil by the French Creek determined that a miner could earn as much as $150 per day mining in the Black Hills. Custer wrote in a letter of August 15, 1874 to the Assistant Adjutant General of the Department of Dakota that \\"there is no doubt as to the existence of various metals throughout the hills. ... [And] examinations at numerous points confirm and strengthen the fact of the existence of gold in the Black Hills.\\"Cozzens, p. 166. His messages were carried by scout Charley Reynolds to Fort Laramie, and from there it was telegraphed to the press eastwards.Hutton, p. 168. The force remained there at Agnes Park until August 15 whereupon it turned around to return to Fort Lincoln. The expedition returned on August 30, with the scouts returned to their reservations on September 10.Cozzens, p. 167. In total, Custer and his forces had traveled for 60 days over 883 miles.Hatch, p. 148.Gold miners in the Black Hills. The gold rushes that resulted from Custer's discoveries antagonised the Sioux Indians and provoked the war in which Custer was to lose his life.

It opened in 1968 as Eyre Technical High School. Built during the boom period, student enrolment reached around 1,500 in the 1970s. Today, Edward John Eyre High School, also known as Senior Secondary Campus of the Whyalla Secondary College, has a student population of over 400. Eyre High School caters to a wide cross-section of the community. Its Young Mum's program supports young mothers to complete their education. The Pre-Industry Program and Trade School assists students in preparation in the trade areas. The specialist volleyball course lead to wins in state and national competitions. Edward John Eyre High is proposed to be merged with Whyalla High School and Stuart High School. The new merged school is intended to be on Nicholson Avenue, Whyalla Norrie between the Whyalla campuses of the University of South Australia and TAFE SA and expected to open for the 2022 school year.  History  =Eyre High 1968-2008= 2008 saw Edward John Eyre High celebrating its 40th birthday. During those 40 years, the school has had two other names, Eyre Technical High School and Eyre High School. For many people, the school will always be Eyre High School. The main buildings of the school were designed by Jim Loveday. They are correctly positioned so as to make the best use of the sun and to reduce the amount of heat gain. This has been positive for those who have used the buildings. The initial enrolment of 5 classes of Year 8 students were housed at Whyalla High and Memorial Oval Primary School. In 1968 these students moved into the new buildings of Eyre Technical High School on Grundel Street and along with the new Year 8s, brought the enrolment to 711. The late sixties and early seventies were a period of rapid population growth in Whyalla. By the end of the school’s first year, the school population had out-grown the existing main building. To accommodate the increasing enrolment, a new South wing with 8 classrooms and 3 Art rooms was added. These additions were not enough to keep up with population growth. By 1972, the western quadrangle hosted a portable science laboratory and many \\"temporary\\" classrooms, some of which are still at the school. The school reached its highest enrolment of 1280 students in this period. In 1971 the school had its first name change and became Eyre High School. The name change was in-line with government policy to remove the distinction between trades orientated Technical High Schools and academically orientated High Schools. In the early 1980s, the effect of the closure of the shipyard was felt with decreasing population in the city leading to decreasing enrolments. Margaret Grant made the most of this situation, by relocating the library from upstairs in the main building to 6 classrooms, later 7 rooms in the South Wing. This created the space for a well laid out library to serve students and staff. In 1986 there was a further name change from Eyre High to Edward John Eyre High School. This was done to more closely identify the school with the explorer who it was named after. The longer name also meant that the school was no longer confused with Ayr High School in Queensland. In 1989 the population of the all of Whyalla's schools were trending down in line with the decrease in population of the city. As a result, the Education Department in consultation with School Councils changed the structure of secondary schools to create two junior high schools and a senior high school E.J. Eyre High. From 1992, the school catered for Year 11, 12 and adult students. It has a wide range of courses which include the Pre-Industry Program and Trade Schools for the Future. It was the first school in the state to have a Young Mums Program.

It first appeared in 1681, some seventy-five years after Shakespeare's version, and is believed to have replaced Shakespeare's version on the English stage in whole or in part until 1838.Stanley Wells, \\"Introduction\\" from King Lear, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 63; Stanley Wells and Michael Dobson, eds., The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 247; Grace Ioppolo, ed., King Lear, New York, Norton Critical Edition, 2008, Introduction, p. xii. Unlike Shakespeare's tragedy, Tate's play has a happy ending, with Lear regaining his throne, Cordelia marrying Edgar, and Edgar joyfully declaring that \\"truth and virtue shall at last succeed.\\" Regarded as a tragicomedy, the play has five acts, as does Shakespeare's, although the number of scenes is different, and the text is about eight hundred lines shorter than Shakespeare's. Many of Shakespeare's original lines are retained, or modified only slightly, but a significant portion of the text is entirely new, and much is omitted. The character of the Fool, for example, is absent. Although many critics – including Joseph Addison, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Charles Lamb, William Hazlitt, and Anna Jameson — condemned Tate's adaptation for what they saw as its cheap sentimentality, it was popular with theatregoers, and was approved by Samuel Johnson, who regarded Cordelia's death in Shakespeare's play as unbearable. Shakespeare's version continued to appear in printed editions of his works, but, according to numerous scholars, including A.C. Bradley and Stanley Wells, did not appear on the English stage for over a hundred and fifty years from the date of the first performance of Tate's play.A.C. Bradley, Shakespearean Tragedy, 1904. Reprinted by Macmillan 1976. Lecture VII, p. 199.Bradley, Lecture VIII, p. 261. Actors such as Thomas Betterton, David Garrick, and John Philip Kemble, who were famous for the role of Lear, were portraying Tate's Lear, not Shakespeare's. The tragic ending was briefly restored by Edmund Kean in 1823. In 1838, William Charles Macready purged the text entirely of Tate, in favour of a shortened version of Shakespeare's original. Finally, Samuel Phelps returned to the complete Shakespeare text in 1845. Comparison with Shakespeare =Shakespeare's version= Shakespeare gave the old story a tragic ending. In Shakespeare's version, Lear, King of Britain, is growing old, and decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters – Goneril, wife of the Duke of Albany, Regan, wife of the Duke of Cornwall, and the youngest daughter, Cordelia, sought in marriage by the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France. The King decides that he will give the best part of the kingdom to the daughter who loves him most, and asks his three daughters to state how much they love him. Goneril and Regan make hypocritical, flattering speeches, and are rewarded with a third each; Cordelia, however, cannot or will not stoop to false flattery for gain, and tells her father that she loves him as much as she should, and that she will love her husband as well if she marries. Enraged, the King disinherits and disowns his once-favourite child, and divides her portion between her two elder sisters. The loyal Earl of Kent speaks up boldly to defend Cordelia, and is banished by the furious King. The Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit on finding Cordelia deprived of a dowry, but the King of France gladly accepts her as his bride. In a sub-plot, the Earl of Gloucester is tricked by his wicked, illegitimate younger son, Edmund, into believing that his virtuous, legitimate elder son, Edgar is plotting his death. Edgar is forced to flee for his life, and disguises himself as a madman. Kent, returning in disguise, offers himself in service to Lear, and is accepted. Lear also enjoys the loyalty of his Fool. Goneril and Regan, now that they have the kingdom, treat their father with contempt, and demand that he reduce the number of knights attending on him. Lear curses his daughters, and rushes out into the storm. Gloucester tries to assist the King, despite being forbidden to by Regan and Cornwall. Edmund betrays his father, to inherit sooner. Regan and Cornwall interrogate Gloucester, and Cornwall gouges out Gloucester's eyes, before being killed by a horrified servant. Lear is raving in the storm with Kent and the Fool, his sanity gone. They are joined by Edgar, pretending to be mad. Edgar meets his blinded father. Grieved and shocked, he maintains his disguise but stays with his father and manages to save him from suicide. Goneril and Regan both fall in love with Edmund and become jealous of each other. Edgar fights and kills a servant sent by Goneril to kill his father. He finds in the dead servant's pocket a letter from Goneril to Edmund, proposing that Edmund murder Albany and marry her. Cordelia meets Lear and they are reconciled. His frenzy has passed, and doctors are taking care of him. Edgar, still disguised, gives Goneril's incriminating letter to Albany. An army, sent by Cordelia's forces in France, fights the British forces and is defeated. Lear and Cordelia are captured and sent to prison. Albany intends to show them mercy, but Edmund secretly sends a message to the prison to have them hanged. Edgar accuses Edmund of treachery, and challenges him to a duel. The two brothers fight, and Edmund is fatally wounded. Goneril rushes out in despair. Regan dies, and Goneril stabs herself to death, after confessing that she poisoned Regan. Edgar then reveals his identity to Edmund, and tells how their father died from frailty, joy, and grief, when Edgar revealed himself to him. Edmund expresses remorse, and confesses his order to have Lear and Cordelia hanged in prison. A reprieve is sent too late: Lear enters with Cordelia's body in his arms, howling in anguish. Kent tries to tell Lear how he served him in disguise, but Lear is unable to comprehend this, and has thoughts only for his dead daughter — \\"I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever.\\" His heart breaks and he dies. Albany says that Kent and Edgar will rule in the Kingdom, but Kent hints at his own approaching death. =Tate's version= Tate's version omits the King of France, and adds a romance between Cordelia and Edgar, who never address each other in Shakespeare's original. Cordelia explains in an aside that her motive for remaining silent when Lear demands public expressions of love is that he leave her without a dowry, so she can escape the \\"loathed embraces\\" of Burgundy. Nevertheless, when Burgundy departs, his obvious self-interest temporarily causes her to lose faith in Edgar's love and fidelity, and, left alone with him, she tells him not to speak to her again of love. There is no Fool in Tate's version, so Lear, left to his daughters' mercies, has the fidelity only of the disguised Kent. Cordelia never leaves for France, but stays in England and tries to find her father in the storm, to help him. Tate gives her a servant or confidant, Arante. Tate adds further wickedness to the character of Edmund, who plans to rape Cordelia, and sends two ruffians to abduct her. They are driven off by the disguised Edgar, who then reveals his identity to Cordelia, and is rewarded by being accepted back into her love again. The battle to restore Lear to the throne is not from a foreign army sent by Cordelia, but from the British people, who are resentful of the tyranny of Goneril and Regan, indignant at their treatment of Lear, and outraged by the blinding of Gloster (changed in spelling from Shakespeare's original). As in Shakespeare's version, Lear's side loses, and he and Cordelia are taken prisoner. Edmund ignores Albany's wish to show mercy, and sends a secret message to have them hanged. Edgar reveals his identity to Edmund before the brothers fight. Edmund dies with no sign of remorse and makes no attempt to save Lear and Cordelia. Instead of Goneril poisoning Regan and later stabbing herself, the two sisters secretly poison each other. Gloster survives the shock of learning the identity of Edgar, whom he has treated unjustly. Lear kills two men who approach Cordelia to hang her, and Edgar and Albany arrive with a reprieve. Albany resigns the crown to Lear, and Lear announces that \\"Cordelia shall be Queen.\\" Lear gives Cordelia to Edgar — \\"I wrong'd Him too, but here's the fair Amends.\\" Lear, Kent, and Gloster will retire \\"to some cool Cell.\\" The overjoyed Edgar declares that \\"Truth and Virtue shall at last succeed.\\" Tate's version is about 800 lines shorter than Shakespeare's.Wells, p. 62. Some of Shakespeare's original lines are left intact; some are modified slightly, or given to different speakers. In the words of Stanley Wells, Tate \\"rather asked for trouble by retaining as much of Shakespeare as he did, thereby inviting odious comparisons with verse that he wrote himself.\\" But Wells also points out that at the time that Tate was making his alterations, Shakespeare was not regarded as a master whose works could not be touched, but \\"as a dramatist whose works, however admirable, required adaptation to fit them for the new theatrical and social circumstances of the time, as well as to changes in taste.\\" Many of the changes that are made by Tate are a result of Restoration ideas of the time. Tate's play was popular in the 1680s, after the restoring of the monarchy after the Interregnum. This time is known as the Restoration and there were specific tastes and ideas about theatre at this time due to the political and social climate which influenced the changes Tate made. James Black supports this claim by stating, \\"The Restoration stage was often an extension of the real-life political and philosophical milieu.\\" Tate chose to draw upon politics and restore Lear to his throne just as Charles II was restored as the English monarch making the play more topical and relatable with audiences at the time. Not only can Tate's restoring Lear to the throne be justified by Restoration sensibilities but the addition of the love story between Cordelia and Edgar, and the omission of the Fool are also the result of Restoration ideas. Background and history Thomas Betterton was the first to play Tate's Lear.The earliest known performance of Shakespeare's King Lear is one which took place at the court of King James I on 26 December 1606.Wells and Dobson, p. 247. Some scholars believe that it was not well received, as there are few surviving references to it.Charles Boyce, Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare, New York, Roundtable Press, 1990, p. 350. The theatres were closed during the Puritan Revolution, and while records from the period are incomplete, Shakespeare's Lear is only known to have been performed twice more, after the Restoration, before being replaced by Tate's version. Tate's radical adaptation — The History of King Lear — appeared in 1681. In the dedicatory epistle, he explains how in Shakespeare's version, he realised that he had found \\"a Heap of Jewels, unstrung and unpolisht; yet so dazling in their Disorder, that [he] soon perceiv'd [he] had seiz'd a Treasure\\", and how he found it necessary to \\"rectifie what was wanting in the Regularity and Probability of the Tale,\\" a love between Edgar and Cordelia, which would make Cordelia's indifference to her father's anger more convincing in the first scene, and would justify Edgar's disguise, \\"making that a generous Design that was before a poor Shift to save his Life.\\"Nahum Tate, The History of King Lear, Epistle Dedicatory. The History of King Lear was first performed in 1681, in the Duke's Theatre in London, with the leading roles taken by Thomas Betterton (as Lear) and Elizabeth Barry (as Cordelia), both remembered now for their portrayal of Shakespeare's characters. Tate relates that he was \\"Rackt with no small Fears\\" because of the boldness of his undertaking, until he \\"found it well receiv'd by [his] Audience\\" This happy-ending adaptation was, in fact, so well received by audiences, that, according to Stanley Wells, Tate's version \\"supplanted Shakespeare's play in every performance given from 1681 to 1838\\", and was \\"one of the longest-lasting successes of the English drama.\\" As Samuel Johnson wrote, more than eighty years after the appearance of Tate's version, \\"In the present case the public has decided. Cordelia from the time of Tate has always retired with victory and felicity.\\"Samuel Johnson on Shakespeare, London, Penguin Books, 1989, p. 222-3. Famous Shakespearean actors such as David Garrick, John Philip Kemble, and Edmund Kean who played Lear during that period were not portraying the tragic figure who dies, broken-hearted, gazing at his daughter's body, but the Lear who regains his crown and gleefully announces to Kent: :Why I have News that will recall thy Youth; :Ha! Didst Thou hear 't, or did th' inspiring Gods :Whisper to me Alone? Old Lear shall be :A King again. David Garrick played Tate's Lear to the end of his career, and drew tears from audiences, even without the death scene.Although Shakespeare's entire text did not reappear on stage for over a century and a half, this does not mean that it was always completely replaced by Tate's version. Tate's version was itself subject to adaptation. It is known that Garrick used Tate's complete text in his performances in 1742, but playbills advertising performances at Lincoln's Inn Fields the following year (with an anonymous \\"Gentleman\\" playing Lear) mentioned \\"restorations from Shakespeare\\". Garrick prepared a new adaptation of Tate's version for performances given from 1756, with considerable restoration from the earlier parts of the play, although Tate's happy ending was retained, and the Fool was still omitted. Garrick's rival Spranger Barry also played Tate's Lear the same year, in a performance which, according to the poet and playwright Frances Brooke, moved the whole house to tears, though Brooke marvelled that Spranger and Garrick should both have given Tate's work \\"the preference to Shakespeare's excellent original\\", and that Garrick, in particular, should \\"prefer the adulterated cup of Tate to the pure genuine draught offered him by the master he avows to serve with such fervency of devotion.\\"Frances Brooke, The Old Maid (1756), reprinted in Brian Vickers, ed. Shakespeare: The Critical Heritage Volume 4, London, Routledge and Keegan Paul, 1974, p. 249. Although Garrick restored a considerable amount of Shakespeare's text in 1756, it was by no means a complete return to Shakespeare, and he continued to play Tate's Lear in some form to the end of his career. His performances met with enormous success, and continued to draw tears from his audiences, even without Shakespeare's final, tragic scene where Lear enters with Cordelia's body in his arms.Wells, p. 69. Edmund Kean declared that audiences would not know what he was capable of until they saw him over the dead body of Cordelia.As literary critics grew increasingly scornful of Tate, his version still remained \\"the starting point for performances on the English-speaking stage.\\" John Philip Kemble, in 1809, even dropped some of Garrick's earlier restorations of Shakespeare, and returned several passages to Tate. The play was suppressed for several years prior to the death of King George III in 1820, as its focus on a mad king suggested an unfortunate resemblance to the situation of the reigning monarch.Grace Ioppolo, William Shakespeare's King Lear: A Sourcebook. London, Routledge, 2003, p. 79. But in 1823, Kemble's rival, Edmund Kean (who had previously acted Tate's Lear), \\"stimulated by Hazlitt's remonstrances and Charles Lamb's essays,\\" became the first to restore the tragic ending, though much of Tate remained in the earlier acts. \\"The London audience,\\" Kean told his wife, \\"have no notion of what I can do till they see me over the dead body of Cordelia.\\"Edward Dowden, \\"Introduction to King Lear\\" in Shakespeare Tragedies, Oxford University Press, 1912, p. 743. Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, though one critic described his dying scene as \\"deeply affecting\\",George Daniel, quoted in Ioppolo, Sourcebook, p. 79. and with regret, he reverted to Tate. In 1834, William Charles Macready, who had previously called Tate's adaptation a \\"miserable debilitation and disfigurement of Shakespeare's sublime tragedy\\", presented his first \\"restored\\" version of Shakespeare's text, though without the Fool.Ioppolo, Sourcebook, p. 69. Writing of his excessive nervousness, he relates that the audience appeared \\"interested and attentive\\" in the third act, and \\"broke out into loud applause\\" in the fourth and fifth acts.Extracts from Macready's Reminiscences and Selections from his Diaries and Letters ed. F. Pollock, 1876, reproduced in Ioppolo, Sourcebook, p. 80. Four years later, in 1838, he abandoned Tate altogether, and played Lear from a shortened and rearranged version of Shakespeare's text, with which he was later to tour New York, and which included the Fool and the tragic ending. The production was successful, and marked the end of Tate's reign in the English theatre, though it was not until 1845 that Samuel Phelps restored the complete, original Shakespearean text. In spite of Macready's visit to New York with his production of a restored Shakespeare version, Tate remained the standard version in the United States until 1875, when Edwin Booth became the first notable American actor to play Lear without Tate. No subsequent production reverted to Tate, except for occasional modern revivals as historical curiosities, such as that offered by the Riverside Shakespeare Company in March 1985 at The Shakespeare Center in New York City.Eleanor Blau, Lear with a Twist, The New York Times, 8 March 1985 Critical reception While Tate's version proved extremely popular on the stage, the response of literary critics has generally been negative. An early example of approval from a critic is found in Charles Gildon's \\"Remarks on the Plays of Shakespeare\\" in 1710: > The King and Cordelia ought by no means to have dy'd, and therefore Mr Tate > has very justly alter'd that particular, which must disgust the Reader and > Audience to have Vertue and Piety meet so unjust a Reward. . . . We rejoice > at the deaths of the Bastard and the two Sisters, as of Monsters in Nature > under whom the very Earth must groan. And we see with horror and Indignation > the Death of the King, Cordelia and Kent.Ioppolo, Sourcebook, p. 49. Samuel Johnson was so shocked by Cordelia's death, that he avoided rereading the end of Shakespeare's play for years. The translator and author Thomas Cooke also gave Tate's version his blessing: in the introduction to his own play The Triumphs of Love and Honour (1731), he commented that Lear and Gloucester \\"are made sensible or their Errors, and are placed in a State of Tranquility and Ease agreeable to their Age and Condition . . . rejoicing in the Felicity of Edgar and Cordelia.\\" Cooke added that he had \\"read many Sermons, but remember[ed] no one that contains so fine a Lesson of Morality as this Play.\\"Thomas Cooke, The Triumphs of Love and Honour (1731), reprinted in Brian Vickers, ed., Shakespeare: The Critical Heritage Volume 2, London, Routledge and Keegan Paul, 1974, p. 465-6. Samuel Johnson also approved of the happy ending, believing that the fact that Tate's version had so successfully supplanted Shakespeare's was evidence that Shakespeare's tragedy was simply unendurable. Taking the complete disappearance of the tragic ending from the stage as a sign that \\"the public [had] decided\\", he added: > And if my sensations could add anything to the general suffrage, I might > relate that I was many years ago so shocked by Cordelia's death that I know > not whether I ever endured to read again the last scenes of the play till I > undertook to revise them as an editor.Samuel Johnson on Shakespeare, p. > 222-223. Others were less enthusiastic about the alterations. Joseph Addison complained that the play, as rewritten by Tate, had \\"lost half its beauty\\",Joseph Addison in The Spectator no. 40, 16 April 1711, quoted in Brian Vickers (ed) Shakespeare: The Critical Heritage Volume 2, London, Routledge and Keegan Paul, 1974, p. 273. while August Wilhelm Schlegel wrote: > I must own, I cannot conceive what ideas of art and dramatic connexion those > persons have who suppose that we can at pleasure tack a double conclusion to > a tragedy; a melancholy one for hard-hearted spectators, and a happy one for > souls of a softer mould. After surviving so many sufferings, Lear can only > die, and what more truly tragic end for him than to die from grief for the > death of Cordelia? and if he is also to be saved and to pass the remainder > of his days in happiness, the whole loses its signification.August Wilhelm > Schlegel, Dramatic Art and Literature translated by John Black, London, > Henry G. Bohn, 1846, p. 413. Charles Lamb believed that the only decorous end to Lear's sufferings was to let him die. In a letter to the editor of The Spectator in 1828, Charles Lamb expressed his \\"indignation at the sickly stuff interpolated by Tate in the genuine play of King Lear\\" and his disgust at \\"these blockheads\\" who believed that \\"the daughterly Cordelia must whimper [her] love affections before [she] could hope to touch the gentle hearts in the boxes.\\"Charles Lamb, \\"Shakespeare's Improvers\\", Letter to the Editor of The Spectator, 22 November 1828. Reprinted in Works of Charles and Mary Lamb, Volume 1, ed Thomas Hutchinson, Oxford University Press, 1908, pages 420–421. Some years previously, Lamb had criticised Tate's alterations as \\"tamperings\\", and had complained that for Tate and his followers, Shakespeare's treatment of Lear's story: :::::::::is too hard and stony; it must have love-scenes, and a happy ending. It is not enough that Cordelia is a daughter, she must shine as a lover too. Tate has put his hook in the nostrils of this Leviathan, for Garrick and his followers, the showmen of scene, to draw the mighty beast about more easily. A happy ending!—as if the living martyrdom that Lear had gone through,—the flaying of his feelings alive, did not make a fair dismissal from the stage of life the only decorous thing for him. If he is to live and be happy after, if he could sustain this world's burden after, why all this pudder and preparation,—why torment us with all this unnecessary sympathy? As if the childish pleasure of getting his gilt-robes and sceptre again could tempt him to act over again his misused station,—as if at his years, and with his experience, anything was left but to die.Charles Lamb, On the Tragedies of Shakespeare. Quoting that extract from Lamb, and calling him \\"a better authority\\" than Johnson or Schlegel \\"on any subject in which poetry and feelings are concerned\\",William Hazlitt, Characters of Shakespear's Plays, 1817, reprinted London, Bell and Daldy, 1870, p. 124. essayist William Hazlitt also rejected the happy ending, and argued that after seeing the afflictions that Lear has endured, we feel the truth of Kent's words as Lear's heart finally breaks: :::::::::Vex not his ghost: O let him pass! he hates him :::::::::That would upon the rack of this tough world :::::::::Stretch him out longer.Act V, Scene 3, quoted in Hazlitt, p. 124. Anna Jameson complained that Tate had turned Cordelia \\"into a puling love heroine\\".The art and literature critic Anna Jameson was particularly scathing in her criticism of Tate's efforts. In her book on Shakespeare's heroines, published just six years before Macready finally removed all traces of Tate from Shakespeare's play, Jameson wondered > who, after sufferings and tortures such as [Lear's], would wish to see his > life prolonged? What! replace a sceptre in that shaking hand?—a crown upon > that old grey head, on which the tempest had poured in its wrath, on which > the deep dread-bolted thunders and the winged lightnings had spent their > fury? O never, never!Anna Jameson, Shakespeare's Heroines, 1832, reprinted > London, G. Bell and Sons, 1913, p. 213. Jameson was equally appalled by the introduction of a romance between Cordelia and Edgar, which had not been part of the old legend. While acknowledging that prior to Shakespeare's writing of King Lear, some versions of the story had ended happily, and that Tate's returning of the crown to Lear was therefore not a complete innovation, Jameson complained that on stage: > they have converted the seraph-like Cordelia into a puling love heroine, and > sent her off victorious at the end of the play—exit with drums and colours > flying—to be married to Edgar. Now anything more absurd, more discordant > with all our previous impressions, and with the characters as unfolded to > us, can hardly be imagined. The Shakespearean critic A.C. Bradley was more ambivalent. Though agreeing that we are right to \\"turn with disgust from Tate's sentimental adaptations, from his marriage of Edgar and Cordelia, and from that cheap moral which every one of Shakespeare's tragedies contradicts, 'that Truth and Virtue shall at last succeed'\\",Bradley, p. 205-206. yet he \\"venture[d] to doubt\\" that \\"Tate and Dr. Johnson [were] altogether in the wrong\\". Sharing Johnson's view that the tragic ending was too harsh, too shocking, Bradley observed that King Lear, while frequently described as Shakespeare's greatest work, the best of his plays, was yet less popular than Hamlet, Macbeth, and Othello; that the general reader, though acknowledging its greatness, would also speak of it with a certain distaste; and that it was the least often presented on stage, as well as being the least successful there.Bradley, pages 198–9. Bradley suggested that the feeling which prompted Tate's alteration and which allowed it to replace Shakespeare on stage for over a century was a general wish that Lear and Cordelia might escape their doom. Distinguishing between the philanthropic sense, which also wishes other tragic figures to be saved, and the dramatic sense, which does not, but which still wishes to spare Lear and Cordelia, he suggested that the emotions have already been sufficiently stirred before their deaths, and he believed that Shakespeare would have given Lear \\"peace and happiness by Cordelia's fireside\\", had he taken the subject in hand a few years later, at the time that he was writing Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale.Bradley, p. 206. Agreeing with Lamb that the agony that Lear has undergone makes \\"a fair dismissal from the stage of life the only decorous thing for him\\", Bradley argues that \\"it is precisely this fair dismissal which we desire for him\\", not the renewed anguish which Shakespeare inflicts on him with the death of Cordelia. As Tate's Lear disappeared from the stage (except when revived as a historical curiosity), and as critics were no longer faced with the difficulties of reconciling a happy ending on the stage with a tragic ending on the page, the expressions of indignation and disgust became less frequent, and Tate's version, when mentioned at all by modern critics, is usually mentioned simply as an interesting episode in the performance history of one of Shakespeare's greatest works.  Tate's Lear in the 20th and 21st centuries  Nahum Tate's The History of King Lear was successfully remounted in New York, at The Shakespeare Center on Mahattan's Upper West Side, staged by the Riverside Shakespeare Company in 1985.Eric Sven Ristad. \\"Excellent production of butchered King Lear.\\" The Tech, Tuesday, 9 April 1985. For this production, conventions of the mid-17th-century English theatre, when Tate's Lear was popular, were used in the staging, such as raked stage covered with green felt (as was the custom for tragedies),Howard Kissell, \\"King Lear for Optimists,\\" Women's Wear Daily, 22 March 1985. footlights used for illumination on an apron stage (or curved proscenium stage), and period costumes drawn from the era of David Garrick. Musical interludes were sung by cast members during the act breaks, accompanied by a harpsichord in the orchestra pit before the stage. The production was directed by the company's artistic director, W. Stuart McDowell, and featured Eric Hoffmann in the role of Lear, and supported by an Equity company of fifteen, including Frank Muller in the role of the Bastard Edmund.Mel Gussow, \\"Tate's Lear at Riverside,\\" The New York Times, 5 April 1985. The play, with its \\"happy ending\\", became known as a \\"King Lear for optimists\\" by the press, and proved one of the most popular productions by the Riverside Shakespeare Company. The play formed part of the American Shakespeare Center's 2013–2014 \\"Slightly Skewed Shakespeare\\" Staged Reading series, produced on 19 April 2014 by graduate students from Mary Baldwin College's Shakespeare and Performance MLitt/MFA program.

Maxwell occupied himself a number of activities, selling curios and offering to guide visitors to the port. He began collecting plants and insects of the region, assisting the botanist James Drummond in 1846. The collections he made, in the company of Drummond and Ferdinand von Mueller, would provide type specimens for the publication of scientific descriptions. Maxwell's collections are now preserved in Australian herbarium, his contribution to the botanical knowledge of the region and Flora Australiensis was noted by Mueller in the Gardeners' Chronicle; > Only two years ago I made long journeys with him over rough country for > several days on horseback to collect plants and seeds.

(1165 – 29 September 1217), was a French nobleman who became a Cistercian monk. He is venerated as a beatus in the Catholic Church. Life John was the son of André de Montmirail, Lord of Montmirail and Ferté-Gaucher, and Hildiarde d'Oisy, daughter of Simon d'Oisy, Castellan of Cambrai. He was given a religious upbringing by his mother, and was well educated. He became the first Lord of Condé. While young, he embraced a military career and was presented at the Royal Court, as constable of France, where he formed a lasting friendship with Philip Augustus (who later became King Philip II of France); he became, not only the friend and favorite of the King, but also later his advisor. On one occasion, John was even said to have saved Philip's life. The dissipations of court life led him to neglect the training of his youth; even his marriage with Helvide de Dampierre, sister of Guy II of Dampierre, failed to effect a change. King Philip II later decorated him with the title of Baron. In his thirtieth year he met Jobert, Prior of St-Etienne de Montmirail, and experienced a conversion. He built a hospital for the sick of all kinds, but the objects of his predilection were the lepers, and those hopelessly afflicted. He wore a hair-shirt, frequently passing entire nights in prayer. After a while, he entered the Cistercian monastery of Longpont, after having distributed among the poor all his possessions not needed by his wife and family. He was abused for his decision by his former friends. Even members of his own family disapproved of his abandonment of honour and wealth for poverty and subjection. He died at Longpont on 29 September 1217. Veneration Miracles were said to be wrought at his tomb, and attracted pilgrims. By the 1230s, John was being venerated as a miracle-working saint. Pope Leo XIII granted a special office in his honour for the diocese of Soissons. He was beatified in 1891. His feast is celebrated on 29 September.

The encyclical states: :The war is over but peace has not yet arrived. The reason for this is, that unjust lies are substituted for truth. In some countries the press turns against religion and ridicules religious feelings. In many others, there is continued persecution of the Christian faithful. It is therefore necessary in this Holy Year 1950, to preach the truth and the true gospel of Christ. :Pope Pius XII calls for Church-wide efforts, to begin a veritable crusade of prayer among the faithful to implore suitable remedies for the present evils. He requests worldwide public prayers on March 26, Passion Sunday. The Pope will on that day descend into the Basilica of St. Peter to pray not only with the whole Catholic world. Those who, because of illness or old age or other reasons, cannot come to church, are requested to pray at home.Anni sacri, 9  Quotations from the encyclical  * Although war has almost everywhere ceased, nevertheless, the longed-for peace has not come - a stable and solid peace which might happily solve the many and ever- increasing reasons for discord. Many nations are still opposed to each other; and as confidence lessens an armaments race begins, leaving the hearts of all overcome by fear and trepidation.Anni sacri, 2 * Not only the greatest evil but the root of all evil is this: often the lie is substituted for the truth, and is then used as an instrument of dispute. On the part of not a few religion is passed by as a thing of no importance, and elsewhere absolutely prohibited in family and social life as a remnant of ancient superstitions; public and private atheism is exalted in such a way that God and His law are being abolished, and morals no longer have any foundation. The Press also too often vulgarly reviles religious feeling, while it does not hesitate to spread the most shameful obscenities, agitating and with incalculable harm leading into vice tender childhood and betrayed youth.Anni sacri, 3 * We must above all deplore with overwhelming sadness that in not a few nations the rights of God, Church and human nature itself are outraged and trampled upon. Sacred ministers, even those invested with high dignities, are either driven from their proper Sees, exiled and imprisoned, or impeded in a manner preventing them from exercising their ministry. In the field of education, whether of lower or of university level, as well as in publications and the Press, permission to explain and defend the doctrine of the Church either is not given or is so restricted and subjected to such surveillance by official censorship that the arbitrary proposition that truth, liberty and religion must submissively serve only the civil authority seems to be the established principle.Anni sacri, 5 * No one must be idle and lazy in the face of so many evils and dangers, while those in the other camp strive to destroy the very basis of Catholic religion and Christian worship. Let it never come to pass, that \\"the children of this world are wiser, than the children of light\\" (Luke xvi. 8); let it never be that the latter are less active than the former.Anni sacri, 8 * With faith, love and hope, therefore, We address to Him Our prayers. May He then, especially during this Holy Year, benignly look down upon humanity, oppressed by so many misfortunes, assailed by so many fears and by waves of so many discords. And as one day, by His divine sign, He calmed the tempest on the Lake of Galilee, so today may He quieten human storms.Anni sacri, 13 References  External links  * Encyclical Sacri Anni on the Vatican website 1950 documents Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII March 1950 events 1950 in Christianity Catholicism and atheism Criticism of atheism ","title":"Anni sacri"},{"id":"16087189","text":"::Not to be confused with the Château de Fougères in Ille-et-Vilaine.

Originally an 11th-century structure, it was entirely rebuilt at the end of the 15th century, with only the large, square keep remaining original. The initial reconstruction retained the defensive aspect of the castle: moat, cannon-holes, parapet walk, etc. During the next century, Renaissance refinements, such as a gallery, mullioned windows and steep-sloped roofs were added. During the 19th century, a spinning mill was installed in the chapel. The castle was purchased and restored by the state in the 1930s.

Blond set up various publishing firms over the years, including Blond Educational in 1962, which he sold in 1969 to CBS, and he went into partnership with Desmond BriggsAlso author of a cookbook, Entertaining Single- Handed (Penguin, 1968.) as Blond & Briggs in 1960, an informal arrangement that lasted until 1979 when Briggs retired and Harlech Television bought the company in 1979, retaining Blond as an advisor. In a management buyout Blond regained control after two years, and established his last partnership, Blond, Muller and White. Century Hutchinson absorbed this firm in 1987. Blond was an early director and publisher of satirical magazine Private Eye. His friendship with James Goldsmith (and other members of the Clermont Club circle) survived Goldsmith's numerous writs to the magazine in the mid-1970s. In 1955, Blond married Charlotte, the daughter of John Strachey;Obituary, The Times, 1 March 2008. the marriage lasted until 1960, and Charlotte eventually married the political journalist Peter Jenkins.

She prays for God’s mercy. She prays also for those who persecute you see below Pope Pius XII describes a decade of ” the most terrible and saddest persecutions” in these regions. The Church has lost its freedom, Church associations and religious institutes were closed, bishops cannot operate, or worse, they are jailed or exiled. Both, the Catholic faithful of the Latin and Oriental rites are suffering, but the Eastern Church has been forced to disband or unite with the Russian Orthodox Church. All Eastern cardinals, József Mindszenty, Aloysius Stepinac and Stefan Wyszyński are persecuted and jailed for their faith.Dum Maerenti Animo, 4, 6 The apostolic letter reminds of the 500th anniversary of the \\"Turkish bell\\" a prayer crusade ordered by his predecessors against the dangers from the East. He asks the faithful throughout the world, to pray for the persecuted Church in the East during the mid-day Angelus. The letter mentions that some Christians lose courage. Others argue, that the teachings of Christ should be updated, to fit their new realities. Pius calls this the wrong kind of reconciliation. Heaven and earth will disappear before His Word disappears. The Pope encourages to endure the tribulations, even if no contact with him or Church officials are possible. He assures the faithful in Eastern Europe, that all Christianity is full of admiration and united with them in prayer. Finally, he asks them to pray with him for those who persecute them.Dum Maerenti Animo, 17  Quotations  ** Daily we implore God’s powerful support, to strengthen your faith, to reduce your anxieties, to comfort you with heavenly graces. May he bring back the misled members of his mystical body. May he, after quieting of the present turbulence, restore fully his peace, based on truth and justice.Dum Maerenti Animo, 6 ** Our Redeemer never forgets His Church. You know this. He never abandons her. As the waves around the little boat of Peter grow larger, He is awake, even if he appears to sleep. “I am with you every day to the end of time”. But, if He is with us, who is against us? Christ is with you, and will never deny his divine support, if you only ask him.Dum Maerenti Animo, 7 ** Be assured, the whole family of Christianity stands in respectful admiration before you, and what you suffer in silence for so long. She prays for God’s mercy, so you may not fall under the harsh atheistic attacks or the deceitful errors. She prays also for those who persecute you, as the Christian Law of Love requires.

The Bulldogs were led by sixth-year head coach Marty Fine and played their home games at Bulldog Stadium. This was the first season in which Bryant competed at the NCAA Division I FCS level. The Bulldogs have previous played at the NCAA Division II level as a member of the Northeast-10 Conference. They finished the season with a record of 7–4. Schedule Game summaries =Central Connecticut State (Aug. 30th)= If there were any questions as to whether the Bryant University football team was ready for Division I, Saturday's effort at Central Connecticut provided all the answers. Facing a talented Blue Devil team in the school's season opener, Bryant pushed Central Connecticut before coming up short, 42-35 Saturday night at Arute Field. Bryant (0-1) trailed 21-13 at the half, but roared back as the Bulldog defense kept the Blue Devil offense in check for most of the second half. A Lindsey Gamble 24-yard run down to the Central 33-yard line early in the fourth helped set up a 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jay Graber to Michael Canfora, trimming the lead Central lead down to two, 21-19. Going for the two-point conversion, Graber hit Vinton South across the middle to complete the 2-point conversion and tie the game at 21-21. Another strong defensive stop forced Central into another three and out by the Blue Devil offense. But on the ensuing punt, the Blue Devils failed to get the punt off and the Bulldogs took over deep in the Central Connecticut territory. Three plays later, Gamble rumbled in from a yard out and the Bulldogs took their first lead of the game. James Mallory finally gave Central Connecticut (1-0) fans something to cheer for in the second half as he broke free down the left side line for a 92-yard touchdown run to knot the game back up at 28-28. Special teams play haunted the Bulldogs and after failing to pick up a first down, Central managed to block another Bulldog punt and Cory Robinson fell on the ball in the end zone to push the Blue Devils back out in front 35-28. Bryant would answer again, however, as Canfora and Graber hooked up again for a 15-yard touchdown to tie the game at 35-35. Central Connecticut opened the game blocking a Bryant punt on the Bulldogs' opening drive in the first quarter as Jordan Knight picked up the loose ball and ran it back 22 yards for the game's first score. Chris Bird had a big day kicking a 37-yard field goal in the first half and adding a school- record 47-yard field goal at the end of the half to make it 21-13 at the break. Bryant got a gift penalty from Central Connecticut as Jerell Smith made a nice 32-yard run down to the Central 29 as time expired in the half. But a facemask penalty added 15 yard penalties, giving the Bulldogs one more play and Bird just squeaked his kick just inside the uprights. =Southern Connecticut State (Sept. 6th)= Junior running back Jerell Smith rushed for a career-high 221 yards on 34 carries to help lead Bryant University to a 39-36 non-conference win over Southern Connecticut before 2,417 at Bulldog Stadium Saturday afternoon. The win improves Bryant's record to 1-1 on the season heading into next week's home game with Merrimack College (1 p.m.). Southern Connecticut drops to 1-1 on the season. In the first matchup between the two schools since last year's NCAA playoffs, won by the Owls 45-28, the Bulldogs capitalized on several Southern Connecticut mistakes to pull out the fourth quarter, come-from-behind victory. \\"If we don't keep the ball in the shoot, they are going to run away from us, and that's what happened today,\\" said Bryant coach Marty Fine. Southern Connecticut (1-1), ranked 20th in Division II and picked to win the Northeast-10 Conference this season, got a strong passing effort from quarterback Steve Armstrong. The senior signal caller was 17 for 23 passing for 282 yards and threw three touchdowns before leaving the game with an injury early in the third. Armstrong's replacement Kevin Lynch came on to throw a pair of touchdowns, including a 75-yarder to Ty Marshall to vive the Owls a 28-21 lead with 3:30 left in the third. But in the fourth quarter, key plays by the Bryant defense and special teams and the hard running of Smith, helped Bryant rally. A Samad Wagstaff interception near midfield as the quarter came to a close resulted in a Smith 10-yard touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Southern fumbled the return and Bryant's Franck Tebou was there to recover. That play led to another Smith touchdown, making it 33-28 with 13:17 left. Another fumble on the kickoff by the Owls gave the ball back to the Bulldogs and this time Mike Canfora was there to bull his way in from the 1-yard line to put Bryant on top 39-28. Lynch and the Owls were done, as the freshman connected with Pete Digangi for a 6-yard score to pull to within 39-36 with 7:53 remaining. Bryant was forced to punt after the drive stalled out at their own 34-yard line, but on Southern's next possession, linebacker Paul Polomski picked off a Lynch pass at the 45-yard line and the Bulldogs were able to run out the clock. Smith's 221 yards are a career-high for the Howard University transfer and the seventh-most yards in a game, tying him with Lorenzo Perry who had 221 at Assumption in 2008. Quarterback Jay Graber completed 13 of 25 passes for 164 yards and two touchdowns while Vinton South caught three passes for 64 yards. \\"Southern Connecticut is a good team and they deserve all of their credit,\\" said Jay Graber. \\"They beat us pretty bad last year so it wasn't a Division I, Division II thing, it was a good football game.\\" Ty Marshall had seven catches for 203 yards and two scores for Southern Connecticut . Jarom Freeman, who rushed for an NCAA Division II record 418 yards against the Bulldogs last year, was held in check by the Bulldog defense. The junior finished with 70 yards on 16 carries in the game. Bryce Martins had 11 tackles on the season while Andre White added seven. =Merrimack (Sept. 13th)= Junior tailback Jerell Smith (Brooklyn, NY) rushed for 130 yards on 27 carries to lift the Bryant University football team to a 20-7 non-conference win over Merrimack College before an overflow crowd of 5,530 fans on Homecoming & Reunion Weekend Saturday at Bulldog Stadium. Bryant, with the win, improves to 2-1 on the season heading into next weekend's home game with Monmouth College (1 p.m.). Merrimack, which turned the ball over seven times in the game, drops to 1-1. The Bulldogs, who forced seven turnovers in last week's win over Southern Connecticut, took advantage of an early miscue by the Warriors to get on the board first. A Paul Polomski (Franklin, MA) interception of a Kurt Leone pass midway through the first quarter led to a 31-yard field goal by Chris Bird, giving the Bulldogs a 3-0 lead. Bryant would never trail again. In the second quarter, another interception, this time by Bryant freshman cornerback Samad Wagstaff (New Rochelle, NY), off a pass by Leone helped set up the Bulldogs' first touchdown of the game. Wagstaff, who added another interception in the second half to give him five for the season, returned his first of the day 20 yards to midfield, giving the Bulldogs excellent field position. Seven plays later, Lindsey Gamble (Roxbury, MA) plunged in from a yard out to make it 10-7. Smith would add a 20-yard touchdown run in the final minute of the second quarter to send the Bulldogs into the locker room up 20-0 at the break. Smith, after a career-best 221 yards against Southern Connecticut last week, went over the 1,000 yard mark in his career Saturday. His 130 yards against Merrimack gives him 1,063 yards, becoming the seventh player in school history to go over 1,000 yards rushing in a career. Bryant quarterback Jay Graber (Clarksburg, NJ) completed 14 of 22 passes for 117 yards while Ross Giffune (Foxboro, MA) had a fine day, catching four passes for 43 yards including a long of 17. In addition to forcing seven turnovers, Bryant's defense held Merrimack's run- and-shoot offense to 278 yards in the game. Leone finished the game completing 12 of 36 passes for 143 yards. Backup Mike Sarnese came on later in the second half to replace Leone and completed 4 of 14 attempts for 84 yards but was intercepted three times including once in the end zone by Andre Whyte (Bennington, VT). =Monmouth (Sept. 20th)= Senior running back David Sinisi rushed for 171 yards on 26 carries and scored twice as visiting Monmouth earned its first victory of the season defeating Bryant University 30-17 in non-conference football action Saturday before 4,107 at Bulldog Stadium. Monmouth (1-3) got on the board first as quarterback Brett Burke found John Nalbone for a 6 yard score on the Hawks' second drive of the game. But Bryant would come right back as quarterback Jay Graber engineered a 12-play, 81-yard drive capped by a Jarrett Solimando 5-yard touchdown reception to tie the game up at 7-7 in the first. It was Bryant's longest scoring drive of the season. A Fred Weingart 20-yard field goal and a 3-yard touchdown run by Bobby Giles in the second quarter gave the visitors a 17-7 halftime lead. Bryant (2-2) managed to trim the lead thanks in part to a 19-yard field goal by Chris Bird, but Sinisi and the Hawks put the game away in the fourth with two quick scores, the second coming on a big defensive stop. Sinisi scored the first of his two rushing touchdowns on the day with a 2-yard run up the middle at the start of the final quarter to make it 23-10. Looking to counter, the Bulldogs moved the ball deep into Monmouth territory thanks an impressive 10-play drive. But with the ball on the Hawks' 8-yard line, Graber was intercepted by linebacker T.J. Cerezo in the end zone for a touchback and the Bulldogs came away empty-handed. Three plays later, Sinisi broke through for a game- clinching 70-yard touchdown run down the middle to make it 30-10 and the Hawks never looked back. Sinisi entered the game averaging 133 yards rushing . Graber finished with 261 yards passing on the day and two touchdowns. Anthony DiNaso caught 5 passes for 70 yards while Ross Giffune and Solimando also added five catches for 45 and 42 yards receiving respectively =Wagner (Sept. 27th)= Bryant tailback Jerell Smith (Brooklyn, NY) rushed for 143 yards on 31 carries and the Bulldog defense turned in one of its finest games of the season as the Bulldogs knocked off Wagner College 24-14 Saturday. The win is Bryant's first over a Division I opponent in six tries and the first this season over a member of the Football Championship Subdivision (Bryant defeated DII Merrimack and Southern Connecticut earlier this year). \\"We did a good job on defense today and got a couple of big plays right when we needed it,\\" said Bryant coach Marty Fine following the game. \\"The defense really made some things happen and we were able to stay to our game plan and come out with a great win today.\\" Jay Graber completed 8 of 17 passes including a clutch 20 yard while Lindsey Gamble added 44 yards rushing in the victory. But the story of the day was the play of the Bulldog defense that held Wagner to just 219 yards of offense - including 100 yards through three quarters - before 2,467 on a wet and dreary day at Wagner College Stadium. Bryant overcame a pair of fumbles on punt returns in the game, but made the plays when they had to. It didn't hurt much in that Wagner's offense struggled against the Bryant defense all afternoon. Wagner did strike first as quarterback Adam Farnsworth hit tight end Peter Zagorski with a short pass but the senior was able to break a few tackles and rumbled down the home side line for an 80-yard score. But the play was the only highlight on the day for the Seahawks who were penalized seven times in the game - including several unnecessary roughness penalties. But the Bulldog defense, coming into the game shorthanded with several starters out of the game, stormed right back to take command of the game. An Andre Whyte block of a Kyle Muir punt attempt was recovered by Anthony Castelli who returned it 4 yards to tie the game at 7-7. Later in the first, free safety Bryce Martins helped set up the go-ahead score intercepting Adam Farnsworth inside the Wagner 20-yard line and returning it to the 15. One play later, Lindsey Gamble scored from four yards out to make it 14-7. The wet conditions caused more special teams trouble for Wagner as Muir couldn't handle another snap on a punt attempt and the Bulldogs took over near midfield. Bryant was able to drive down to the Wagner 3-yard line, aided by a beautiful pass from Graber to tight end Jarrett Solimando across the middle. But the Bulldogs couldn't get into the end zone but did come away with three points on a Chris Bird 20-yard field goal to make it 17-7. The Bulldogs opened the second half with an efficient 8 play, 46-yard drive capped by a Graber 7-yard touchdown pass to Staten Island, N.Y. native Anthony DiNaso to make it 24-7. Another defensive surge helped put the game away in the waning minutes. With the Seahawks driving late in the fourth, a Samad Wagstaff blitz from the blind side forced an errant pass by backup quarterback Matt Abbey as John Suarez picked off Abbey and returned the ball deep into Wagner territory. Martins led the way with six tackles while Paul Polomski (Franklin, MA) had five tackles. Defensive end Don Smith (Attleboro, MA) had a huge day, finishing with five tackles plus two big sacks. \\"It was a special day for him (Smith) today and for the entire team,\\" added Fine. =Marist (Oct. 11th)= Quarterback Chris Debowski completed 15 of 28 passes for 321 yards and four touchdowns to lead host Marist College to a 34-7 win over Bryant Saturday evening at Tenney Stadium snapping a three-game losing skid for the Red Foxes. After Bryant's opening drive stalled, Marist (2-5) wasted little time to get off and running as Debowski connected with speedy receiver James LaMacchia for an 80-yard touchdown pass on the Red Foxes' very first play of the game. It would be the first of two deep touchdown passes to LaMacchia who finished with four receptions for 154 yards. Bryant (3-3) moved the ball well in the first half, picking up eight first downs but the Bulldogs were unable to get on the scoreboard as Marist ended Bryant's best scoring chance of the half by intercepting a Jay Graber pass at the goal line. Two Kevin Pauly field goals of 38 and 25 yards rounded out the first half scoring as Marist led 13-0 at the half. The Bulldogs were poised to get on the scoreboard on their first possession to start the second half thanks to the hard running of tailback Lindsey Gamble. The junior energized Bryant's opening drive with several dazzling runs to get the ball inside the Marist 20-yard line, but once again Bryant came up empty as Chris Bird's 25-yard field goal attempt sailed wide. On the ensuing possession, Marist again used another big play to break the game wide open as Debowski hooked up once again with LaMacchia down the right sideline for a 56-yard score to make it 20-0. Debowski would add another 15-yard touchdown pass to R.J. Roe to make it 27-0 before Gamble got Bryant on the board with a 7-yard run up the middle to make it 27-7 with 10:52 left in the game. Gamble finished with 100 yards on 20 carries in the game while Jerell Smith added 94-yard rushing. It was Gambles third 100-yard rushing game of his career. Graber completed 11 of 15 passes for 119 yards. Paul Polomski (Franklin, MA) had eight tackles while Jason Riffe and Don Smith (Attleboro, MA) had seven and six respectively. =Robert Morris (Oct. 18th)= Jerell Smith (Brooklyn, NY) rushed for 104 yards on 16 carries while Anthony DiNaso (Staten Island, NY) caught a pair of touchdown passes to lead Bryant University to a 20-7 win over visiting Robert Morris University before a standing-room only crowd of 5,630 at Bulldog Stadium Saturday afternoon. Scored on its first possession of the game and let the defense handle the rest as Bryant held the Colonials to minus-20 yards rushing on the ground and sacked quarterback Erik Cwalinski eight times, tying a school record. Bryant (4-3) used a good balance attack in starting quickly as the Bulldogs opened with a 66-yard drive on its first possession to take a quick 7-0 lead. Lindsey Gamble (Roxbury, MA) helped keep the drive moving with a nice 19-yard pickup to move the ball down inside the Colonial 20-yard line. Three players later, quarterback Jay Graber hit DiNaso for the first of his two touchdowns on the day as the senior quarterback connected with the sophomore receiver across the middle for with a third-down pass across the middle for a 13-yard touchdown with 12:16 left in the first quarter. It would be the only scoring of the first half, but the Bulldogs would take advantage of a crucial turnover by Robert Morris, the first of only two in the game. After forcing the Bulldogs to punt on their first possession, Robert Morris (2-5) took over with good field position near midfield. But on the ensuing possession, RMU running back Myles Russ fumbled the hand-off and Don Smith (Attleboro, MA) was there to recover. Bryant would take full advantage of the momentum swing as Smith found a seam in the defensive line on the very next play and raced down the right sideline for a 37-yard touchdown to make it 14-0. Graber and DiNaso would hook up again in the fourth, this time on a 19-yard pass play in the corner of the end zone to make it 20-0. Cwalinski would help RMU avoid the shutout as the senior scored from 11 yards out to round out the scoring on the day. DiNaso finished with three catches for 54 yards while teammate Ross Giffune (Foxboro, MA) also had three receptions for 58 yards. Russ, who came into the game averaging 145 yards rushing per game, was held to just 37 on the day. Cwalinski completed 11 of 25 passes for 161 yards for Robert Morris. But the story of the day was the Bryant defense that held a Colonial team averaging 340 yards of offense to only 141 Saturday. Pat Gauthier (Woonsocket, RI) had 7 tackles plus accounted for three of Bryant's eight sacks. Andre Whyte (Bennington, VT) and Andrew Regan (West Newbury, MA) each had five tackles. Freshman Mike McGowan (Attleboro, MA / Bishop Feehan) had a big day in his first start at cornerback. McGowan had a pair of tackles and led the team with three pass breakups. =Massachusetts-Amherst (Oct. 25th)= UMass Amherst quarterback Liam Coen completed 11 of 18 passes for 389 yards and five touchdowns to lead the No. 17 Minutemen to a 42-7 win over visiting Bryant University Saturday afternoon. UMass (5-3), looking to bounce back strong from last week's loss to Richmond, did just that Saturday as the Minutemen scored on their first three possessions before the Bulldogs finally got on the board mid-way through the first quarter. Trailing 21-0, the Bulldogs (4-4) put together a solid scoring drive despite the loss of starting quarterback Jay Graber (Clarksburg, NJ). Graber, who left with 4:50 left in the opening quarter with an injury and did not return, was replaced by backup Kurt Spear (Greene, NY). The junior, seeing action for the first time this season, stepped right in and guided the Bulldogs down field with a solid scoring drive. Spear completed 3 of 4 passes including a 16-yarder to Mike Canfora for 16 yards on his first pass attempt. A 15-yard pass to Ross Giffune (Foxboro, MA) moved the ball down to the UMass 22-yard line. Behind steady blocking by the offensive line up front, junior tailback Lindsey Gamble (Roxbury, MA) moved the ball down to 6 and one play later found a seam into the end zone to make it 21-7 just before the end of the opening quarter. The 16-play drive covered 6 minutes, 41 seconds - the longest scoring drive of the season for the Bulldogs. UMass would answer as Tony Nelson scored from 3 yards out and Jeremy Horne was on the receiving end of a 21-yard pass from Coen to make it 35-7 at the half and the hosts cruised from there. Horne finished with 182 yards and three touchdowns while Korrey Davis rushed for 54 yards on 12 carries. UMass finished the day with 593 yards of total offense including 448 yards through the air. Bryant had 217 yards of offense in the game. Spear finished the day completing 7 of 17 passes for 70 yards with Giffune hauling in three catches for 27 yards. Mike Canfora had two catches for 25 yards. Jerell Smith (Brooklyn, NY) rushed for 56 of Bryant's 126 yards on the ground while Gamble finished with 52 yards on 17 carries. Sophomore Addison Lynch (Braintree, MA) recorded a career-best 12 tackles to lead Bryant defensively. Junior linebacker Paul Polomski (Franklin, MA) added 10 tackles as the Bulldog defense recovered three UMass fumbles, all in the second half. Punter Brian Donnelly (East Dennis, MA) punted a school-record 12 times for 441 yards. =Duquesne (Nov. 1st)= Bryant University running back Jerell Smith rushed for 129 yards on 14 carries while the defense used two fourth quarter interceptions to put the game away as the host Bulldogs pulled away for a 24-10 win over Duquesne here Saturday afternoon. Duquesne quarterback Connor Dixon engineered a solid 10-play scoring drive to open the game as the Dukes jumped out in front first. A Dixon 20-yard pass to Brian Layhue on the Dukes' second-play moved the ball to midfield. Dixon would later hook up with running back Cleo Williams for an 11-yard pass play to move the ball down to the Bryant 25-yard line. With the ball on the Bryant 7-yard line, the Bulldog defense would hold Duquesne to a 24-yard field goal from Mark Troyan. Bryant's (5-4) offense would finally get on the board just before halftime. After a 21-yard punt by Duquesne's Josh Brisk gave the Bulldogs good field position at the Duquesne 44-yard line, quarterback Jay Graber (Clarksburg, NJ) hit Ross Giffune (Foxboro, MA) for a 20-yard gain down to the Duquesne 15-yard line. Two plays later, Mike Canfora (Verona, NJ) took a lateral from Graber and rumbled into the end zone for a 15-yard score. The extra point attempt was wide and the Bulldogs took a 6-3 lead into the locker room at the half. Duquesne (2-6) regained the lead once again late in the third as Dixon connected with Alex Roberson for a 54-yard touchdown pass to make it 10-9. But in the fourth, Lindsey Gamble put the Bulldogs back in front for good, scoring on a 29-yard run down the middle to make it 15-10. On their next possession, the Dukes moved the ball down to the Bryant 40, but junior defensive end Don Smith (Attleboro, MA) blitzed Dixon forcing the sophomore to throw an ill- advised pass that was picked off by linebacker Paul Polomski (Franklin, MA). The Bulldogs came into the game tied for first nationally with a 25 turnovers gained this season. The Duquesne miscue led to a Brian Donnelly (East Dennis, MA) 25-yard field goal to give Bryant an 18-10 lead with just over five minutes left. Needing to go the length of the field to score and possibly force overtime, Duquesne would never get the opportunity as Bryant linebacker Cheyenne Ray (Bellport, NY) picked off Dixon's very first pass attempt at the 29-yard line and returned it the distance for the touchdown, sealing the victory for the Bulldogs. Bryant finished with 445 yards of total offense in the game. The Bulldogs were 7 for 15 on third-down conversions. Gamble finished with 94 yards rushing while Graber completed 18 of 26 passes for 213 yards. Williams finished with 76 yards rushing for Duquesne while Dixon was 16 for 28 passing for 193 yards. =Iona (Nov. 15th)= Lindsey Gamble (Roxbury, MA) rushed for a season-high 163 yards on 15 carries to lead the Bryant University football team to a 23-7 win over Iona College Saturday at a wet and rainy Mazzella Field. The win clinches a winning record for the Bulldogs in their first season of Division I football as Bryant will take a 6-4 record into next Saturday's season finale at Saint Francis (PA). Coming off a bye week, the Bulldogs were slow out of the gate and Iona (3-8) took advantage, scoring the only points of the first half late in the first quarter. Gael freshman quarterback Warren Smith engineered an 11-play drive ending with a 33-yard touchdown pass to the speedy Tim Mastrino for a 7-0 lead. Held scoreless for only the second time this season, Bryant managed just 55 yards rushing in the first half against an Iona defense that came into the game allowing 300 yards rushing. But it was a different story in the second half as quarterback Jay Graber (Clarksburg, NJ) led Bryant on a 10-play scoring drive to open the third quarter. The senior connected with senior tight end Jarrett Solimando (Demarest, NJ) on an 18-yard pass play down to the one-yard line. One play later, junior tailback Jerrell Smith (Brooklyn, NY) dove into the end-zone to finally put Bryant on the scoreboard. Iona would maintain the lead however, as the point after attempt was wide, keeping Gaels in front 7-6. But the scoring drive was just what the team needed. Chris Bird's (Monument Beach, MA) 30-yard field goal atoned for the missed extra point try and the Bulldogs had their first lead of the game, 9-7 with 4:24 left in the third. Still within striking distance, the Gaels continued to move the ball well led by the arm of Warren Smith and the play of Mastrino. But the key play of the game came early in the fourth with the Gaels driving deep into Bryant territory. With the ball on the Bryant 25, and Iona facing a fourth-and-three, Attleboro's Don Smith pressured Warren Smith to scramble out of the pocket and throw an incomplete pass with Andre Whyte (Bennington, Vt.) covering. Taking over on downs, Gamble broke through the line on Bryant's very first play from scrimmage and raced 75 yards for a touchdown to make it 16-7. With the momentum clearly back in Bryant's favor, Jerrell Smith would later add a 50-yard touchdown run of his own and the Bulldogs never looked back. With his 163 yards on the day, Gamble moved into fourth all-time in school history with 1,704 rushing yards. Jerrell Smith, who surpassed the 1,000-yard mark for the season on Bryant's first play of game, finished with 105 yards on the ground, moving him into third-place all-time in school history with 1,723 yards. Anthony DiNaso (Staten Island, NY) had four catches for 64 yards while Bryce Martins (Uncasville, CT) led the defense with 11 tackles. Patrick Gauthier (Woonsocket, RI) and Smith each had seven. Iona's quarterback Smith completed 31 of 53 passes for 272 yards. Mastrino finished an amazing day for the Gaels, catching a school record 18 passes for 167 yards. =St. Francis (PA) (Nov. 22nd)= It may have been the longest road trip in the history Bryant football program, but it will certainly be memorable as Jerell Smith rushed for 150 and quarterback Jay Graber threw three touchdown passes as the Bulldogs rolled to a 23-0 win over Saint Francis (PA) on a snowy afternoon at DeGol Field. The win concludes Bryant's first Division I season with a 7-4 record. The Bulldogs out-gained the Red Flash 382 to 58 in total yards as Graber completed 14 of 19 passes for 160 yards on the day. Ross Giffune hauled in four catches for 59 yards and it was his first touchdown reception of the season that got the Bulldogs on the board first. Bryant put together a nice looking drive right away on its first possession. Hard running from Lindsey Gamble helped move the ball down to the Red Flash eight-yard line, setting up an 8-yard, Graber to Giffune touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to make it 7-0. Two fumbles halted a pair of other Bryant drives in the second quarter but the Bulldogs were able add on a 32-yard field goal by Chris Bird just before the end of the half to take a 10-0 lead into the locker room at the break. The field goal was the 15th in the career for Bird, tying Pete DiMartino's school record. The Bulldog defense enjoyed an outstanding first half, holding Saint Francis to just 12 yards of offense and only one pass completion. In the second half, the Bulldogs stretched the lead to 17-0 as Graber connected with wide receiver Vinton South for a 33-yard score with 1:19 left in the third. The scoring drive covered 10 plays and took off more than five minutes on the clock. Graber and the Bulldogs would put the game away midway through the fourth as the senior signal caller threw his third touchdown pass of the game, this time to Tyler DiGiovanni. The point after was wide but the point didn't matter as the Bulldogs managed to end the season with a win for the first time since the 2000 season and just the second time in the 10-year history of the program.

He built on the legacy of Laplace generalizing his least squares method. He contributed to the fields of probability and statistics, and to their application to finance, demography and social sciences. In particular, he formulated the Bienaymé–Chebyshev inequality concerning the law of large numbers and the Bienaymé formula for the variance of a sum of uncorrelated random variables. Biography With Irénée-Jules Bienaymé ends the line of great French probability thinkers that began with Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, then continued with Pierre-Simon Laplace and Siméon Denis Poisson. After Bienaymé, progress in statistics took place in the United Kingdom and Russia. His personal life was marked by bad fortune. He studied at the Lycée de Bruges and then at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. After participating in the defense of Paris in 1814, he attended the École Polytechnique in 1815. Unfortunately that year's class was excluded in the following year by Louis XVIII because of their sympathy for Bonapartists. In 1818, he lectured on mathematics at the Saint-Cyr Military Academy but, two years later, he entered the Finance Ministry. He was rapidly promoted, first to inspector, then to inspector general. But the new Republican administration removed him in 1848 for his lack of support for the Republican regime. He became professor of probability at the Sorbonne, but he lost his position in 1851. He then became a consultant as an expert statistician for the government of Napoléon III. In 1852 he was admitted to the French Academy of Sciences. After 23 years, Bienaymé became the examiner for the attribution of the academy's prize in statistics. He was also a founding member of the Société Mathématique de France, holding its presidency in 1875. Contributions to mathematics Bienaymé published only 23 articles, half of which appeared in obscure conditions. His first works concerned demographics and actuarial tables. In particular he studied the extinction of closed families (aristocratic families for instance) which declined even as the general population was growing. As a disciple of Laplace and under the influence of Laplace's Théorie analytique des probabilités (1812), he defended the latter's conceptions in a debate with Poisson on the size of juries and on the necessary majority for obtaining a conviction. He translated into French the works of his friend the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, and published the Bienaymé–Chebyshev inequality which gives a simple demonstration of the law of large numbers. He corresponded with Adolphe Quetelet, and also had links with Gabriel Lamé. Bienaymé criticized Poisson's \\"law of large numbers\\" and was involved in a controversy with Augustin Louis Cauchy. Both Bienaymé and Cauchy published regression methods at about the same time. Bienaymé had generalized the method of ordinary least squares. The dispute within the literature was over the superiority of one method over the other. It is now known that ordinary least squares is the best linear unbiased estimator, provided errors are uncorrelated and homoscedastic. At the time, this was not known. Cauchy developed the Cauchy distribution to show a case where the method of ordinary least squares resulted in a perfectly inefficient estimator. This is due to the fact that the Cauchy distribution has no defined variance to minimize. This is the first direct appearance of the Cauchy distribution in the academic literature. The curve had been previously studied by others, though in the English language as the Witch of Agnesi.

The encyclical recalls Pope Pius VI, who appointed bishop John Carroll (bishop) of Baltimore in 1789. It took the help of George Washington, a friend of Carroll, to formalize the erection of the first bishopric of the Catholic Church in the 13 colonies forming USA. One hundred years later, in 1889, Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical Longinqua Oceani addressed the Church in the United States and issued praise and admonitions. By 1939, the Church in the USA has nineteen provinces, 115 dioceses, 200 seminaries and numerous institutions. Pius XII, who recalls his official visit three years earlier, is proud of these efforts. He praises the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C., (which away back had offered him a professorship in 1903). The Pontiff supports the wishes of the American bishops to establish an American College in Rome. The encyclical advises Catholic bishops to be active in advancing racial justice by improving the access of Negroes to Catholic schools. It also critiques blind materialism. Individual happiness can only be achieved by obeying the Commandments of God, whose non-observance undermines the basis of true civilization  Quotations from the encyclical  :* This ruinous and critical state of affairs was put right by the celebrated George Washington, famed for his courage and keen intelligence. He was a close friend of the Bishop of Baltimore. Thus the Father of His Country and the pioneer pastor of the Church in that land so dear to Us, bound together by the ties of friendship. Holding, so to speak, each the other's hand, they form a picture for their descendants, a lesson to all future generations, and a proof that reverence for the Faith of Christ is a holy and established principle of the American people, seeing that it is the foundation of morality and decency, consequently the source of prosperity and progress Pius XII, Enc. Sertum laetitiae 3 :* The more important of (your) institutions We were able to view briefly during the month of October, 1936, when We journeyed across the ocean and had the joy of knowing personally you and the field of your activities. The memory of what We then admired with Our own eyes will always remain indelible and a source of joy in Our heart.Pius XII, Enc. Sertum laetitiae 14 :* Not with the conquest of material space does one approach to God, separation from Whom is death, conversion to Whom is life, to be established in Whom is glory; but under the guidance of Christ with the fullness of sincere faith, with unsullied conscience and upright will, with holy works, with the achievement and the employment of that genuine liberty whose sacred rules are found proclaimed in the Gospel. If, instead, the Commandments of God are spurned, not only is it impossible to attain that happiness which has place beyond the brief span of time which is allotted to earthly existence, but the very basis upon which rests true civilization is shaken and naught is to be expected but ruins over which belated tears must be shed.Pius XII, Enc. Sertum laetitiae 18 :* We confess that We feel a special paternal affection, which is certainly inspired of Heaven, for the Negro people dwelling among you; for in the field of religion and education We know that they need special care and comfort and are very deserving of it. We therefore invoke an abundance of heavenly blessing and We pray fruitful success for those whose generous zeal is devoted to their welfare.Pius XII, Enc.

In World War I she was requisitioned by the U.S. Navy and served under the title USS Santa Teresa (ID 3804). She served as a commercial vessel between the wars, first under her original name, and later as the SS Kent. During World War II she served first with the U.S. Army as the USAT Ernest Hinds, and later with the Navy as USS Kent (AP-28). She spent the final part of the war as an Army hospital ship, once more under the name USAT (or USAHS) Ernest Hinds. Operational history Santa Teresa, an 8890-ton transport, was built in 1918 at Philadelphia, as a civilian passenger liner. Taken over by the Navy for World War I use, she was commissioned in mid-November 1918 as USS Santa Teresa (ID 3804), a week after the Armistice ended the fighting. Between December 1918 and September 1919 Santa Teresa made seven round-trip voyages between the United States and France, primarily bringing home war veterans. The ship was decommissioned in October 1919 and turned over to the U.S. Shipping Board for return to her owners. During the next two decades she operated commercially as SS Santa Teresa and, after 1936, as SS Kent. =World War II= In April 1941 the U.S. Army purchased the Kent. Renamed Ernest Hinds, she was converted to a troopship at Boston, and took part in maneuvers off Cape Cod before being transferred to the Navy in July 1941. After serving as USS Kent (AP-28) for eight months, she was returned to the Army in March 1942 and again became USAT Ernest Hinds. During May 1942 - September 1943 Ernest Hinds operated as a transport, making a trip to Alaska in mid-1942 and thereafter carrying personnel and cargo between the U.S., Hawaii, and the South Pacific and within the latter region. The ship was converted to a hospital ship at San Francisco, California, between September 1943 and June 1944. She then steamed through the Panama Canal to begin service between the U.S. East Coast and the Mediterranean Sea. Ernest Hindss hospital ship service ended in September 1945 and she was again altered to a transport. She carried Jamaican laborers between Florida and Jamaica on behalf of the War Shipping Administration until turned over to the U.S. Public Health Service in April 1946 for use as a floating isolation ward at Jacksonville, Florida. She was transferred to the Maritime Administration in April 1947 and laid up at Brunswick, Georgia. Moved to the James River, Virginia, Reserve Fleet in April 1948, the nearly forty- year-old ship was sold for scrapping in May 1957.

History  The current building was constructed at a cost of $12.7 million by the site of the existing Randolph Vocational Technical Center, Midland Elementary School and adjacent to the Elkins-Randolph County Regional Airport. The architect, SEM Partners, created a two story building of over . The new building was the result of a school consolidation effort in West Virginia. Coalton High School was closed and students from Coalton, WV were bused to Elkins, WV to attend the new high school. In an effort to acknowledge the merger of the two high schools, the school board voted prior to the 1993-1994 school to name the new school Forest Hills High School. The new high school opened during the Fall of 1993 and held commencement exercises during June 1994 for what would become the only graduating class of Forest Hills High School. Following the 1993-1994 school year, several new school board members were elected to the Randolph County Board of Education with support from the Elkins High School Alumni Association. During the summer of 1994, these new board members voted to change the name of the school back to Elkins High School. The school reopened for the 1994-1995 school year as Elkins High School.  Academics  The teachers and administration at EHS promote and reward students for academics and attendance. EHS offers both basic courses and a variety of Advanced Placement courses and Dual Credit courses. Students who attend EHS also have the opportunity to take Vocational classes at the connected Randolph Technical Center (RTC) and College courses. Although not offered every year, EHS, along with the RTC offers 132 courses, six of which are Advanced Placement courses (Music, English Literature and Language, Calculus AB, US History and Government and Politics).

The first experimental vehicles were built in the 18th and 19th century, but it was not until after Richard Trevithick had developed the use of high-pressure steam, around 1800, that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. The first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design, and by the 1850s it was viable to produce them on a commercial basis. This progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use of steam-powered vehicles on roads. Nevertheless, the 1880s to the 1920s saw continuing improvements in vehicle technology and manufacturing techniques, and steam road vehicles were developed for many applications. In the 20th century, the rapid development of internal combustion engine technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis, with relatively few remaining in use beyond the Second World War. Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation, and numerous examples are still in existence. In the 1960s the air pollution problems in California gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam-powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution. Apart from interest by steam enthusiasts, the occasional replica vehicles and experimental technology no steam vehicles are in production at present. Early steam-powered vehicles which were uncommon but not rare, had considerable disadvantages, as seen from the viewpoint of 100 years later. They were slow to start as water had to be boiled to generate the steam. They used dirty fuel (coal) and put out dirty smoke. Fuel was bulky and had to be put on the vehicle by hand using a shovel. The engine needed water, if it were used at top speed, it needed water more often. Most vehicles had metal wheels and less than excellent traction. They were heavy. Like a furnace, hot ash had to be removed and disposed of. In most cases the user had to do their own maintenance. Speed was slow about per hour and acceleration was very slow. At the same time, this was \\"high tech\\" for the time. Later developments were a great improvement, using cleaner liquid fuel (kerosene), being fitted with condensers and rubber tyres, and being much lighter. Early pioneers Murdoch's model steam carriage of 1784, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum Early research on the steam engine before 1700 was closely linked to the quest for self-propelled vehicles and ships, the first practical applications from 1712 were stationary plant working at very low pressure which entailed engines of very large dimensions. The size reduction necessary for road transport meant an increase in steam pressure with all the attendant dangers, due to the inadequate boiler technology of the period. A strong opponent of high pressure steam was James Watt who along with Matthew Boulton did all he could to dissuade William Murdoch from developing and patenting his steam carriage built and operated in model form in 1784. In 1791 he built a larger steam carriage which he had to abandon to do other work. During the latter part of the 18th century, there were numerous attempts to produce self-propelled steerable vehicles. Many remained in the form of models. Progress was dogged by many problems inherent to road vehicles in general, such as adequate road surfaces, suitable power plant giving steady rotative motion, tyres, vibration resistant bodywork, braking, suspension and steering among other issues. The extreme complexity of these issues can be said to have hampered progress over more than a hundred years, as much as hostile legislation. =Verbiest Steam carriage= Steam carriage by Verbiest of 1679 Ferdinand Verbiest is suggested to have built what may have been the first steam carriage in about 1679, but very little concrete information on this is known to exist. Also it seems that the Belgian vehicle served as an inspiration for the Italian Grimaldi (early 1700) and the French Nolet (1748) steam carriage successor. =Cugnot \\"Fardier à vapeur\\"= Cugnot's \\"Fardier à vapeur\\" (\\"Steam wagon\\") of 1769 Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot's \\"machine à feu pour le transport de wagons et surtout de l'artillerie\\" (\\"fire engine for transporting wagons and especially artillery\\") was built in two versions, one in 1769 and one in 1771 for use by the French Army. This was the first steam wagon that was not a toy, and that was known to exist. Cugnot's fardier a term usually applied to a massive two wheeled cart for exceptionally heavy loads, was intended to be capable of transporting 4 tonnes (3.9 tons), and of travelling at up to 4 km/h (2.5 mph). The vehicle was of tricycle layout, with two rear wheels and a steerable front wheel controlled by a tiller. There is considerable evidence, from the period, that this vehicle actually ran, making it probably the first to do so, however it remained a short lived experiment due to inherent instability and the vehicle's failure to meet the Army's specified performance level. =Symington Steam carriage= In 1786 William Symington built a steam carriage. =Fourness and Ashworth Steam car= A British patent No.1674 of December 1788 was granted for a steam car by Fourness and Ashworth. =Trevithick Steam carriage= A replica of Trevithick's 1801 road locomotive Puffing Devil Trevithick's London Steam Carriage of 1803 In 1801 Richard Trevithick constructed an experimental steam- driven vehicle (Puffing Devil) which was equipped with a firebox enclosed within the boiler, with one vertical cylinder, the motion of the single piston being transmitted directly to the driving wheels by means of connecting rods. It was reported as weighing 1520 kg fully loaded, with a speed of 14.5 km/h (9 mph) on the flat. During its first trip it was left unattended and was \\"self destructed\\". Trevithick soon built the London Steam Carriage that ran successfully in London in 1803, but the venture failed to attract interest and soon folded up. In the context of Trevithick's vehicle, an English writer by the name of \\"Mickleham\\" in 1822 coined the term Steam engine: :\\"It exhibits in construction the most beautiful simplicity of parts, the most sagacious selection of appropriate forms, the most convenient and effective arrangement and connexion uniting strength with elegance, the necessary solidity with the greatest portability, possessing unlimited power with a wonderful pliancy to accommodate it to the varying resistance: it may indeed be called The steam engine.\\"Luke Hebert: The Engineer's and Mechanic's Encyclopædia, Vol. 2, Pg. 612, 1849 =Evans Steam-powered amphibious craft= The Oruktor amphibolos by Evans of 1805 In 1805 Oliver Evans built the Oruktor amphibolos (literally Amphibious digger), a steam-powered, flat bottomed dredger that he modified to be self-propelled on both water and land. It is widely believed to be the first amphibious vehicle, and the first steam-powered road vehicle to run in the United States. However, no designs for the machine survive, and the only accounts of its achievements come from Evans himself. Later analysis of Evans's descriptions suggests that the 5hp engine was unlikely to have been powerful enough to move the vehicle either on land or water, and that the chosen route for its demonstration would have had the benefit of gravity, river currents and tides to assist with the vehicles' progress. The dredger was not a success, and after a few years lying idle, was dismantled for parts. =Summers and Ogle Steam carriage= In around 1830 or 1831 Summers and Ogle based at the Iron Foundry, Millbrook, Southampton, made two three wheeled steam carriages. In 1831 the firm's Nathaniel Ogle gave evidence on the steam carriage to the \\"Select Committee of the House of Commons on Steam Carriages\\". In 1832 one of their steam carriages travelled via Oxford to Birmingham and Liverpool. A June 1833 newspaper report described a demonstration in London: Early steam carriage services Hancock's Enterprise steam bus of 1833 Russell's Steam carriage with boiler below the axle and two pistons in 1834 More commercially successful for a time than Trevithick's carriage were the steam carriage services operated in England in the 1830s, principally by associates of Sir Goldsworthy Gurney and by Walter Hancock among others and in Scotland by John Scott Russell. However, the heavy road tolls imposed by the Turnpike Acts discouraged steam road vehicles and for a short time allowed the continued monopoly of horse traction until railway trunk routes became established in the 1840s and 1850s. Sir James C. Anderson and his engineering partner Jasper Wheeler Rogers were the first to bring steam-propulsion vehicles to Ireland. Rogers and Anderson created their versions of these devices in the 1830s and early 1840s where they advocated for an island-wide conveyance network that would utilize Ireland's mail coach roads. An 1838 Cork Southern Reporter article on Anderson's “steam drag, or carriage for common roads” recounts how Anderson and his father (both of Buttevant Castle) spent “a fortune in building twenty-nine unsuccessful carriages to succeed in the thirtieth.\\" Jasper Rogers built his Irish steam-driven cars in a former flint- glass factory, Fort Chrystal, located on what is now known as Dublin's East Wall. Accompanying Rogers’ and Anderson's interests in improvements in Irish conveyance of goods and people, they particularly advocated steam-propelled individual vehicles because the operators, road network staff, and work crews needed to maintain the system were much more encompassing than those utilized by a railway system alone, at a time when Rogers and Anderson were trying to maximize Irish wage employment. They could see that their immediate competitor, the railway, would greatly diminish labor needs within Ireland's transportation infrastructures. Similarly, a national railway system would contract, rather than expand, inner-island travel destinations. Rogers’ and Anderson's steam-vehicle system called for numerous way-stations for refueling and supplying fresh water, and at the same time, these stations could house a “road police” as well as telegraph depots. Essentially most Irish villages, no matter how remote, would participate in this grand steam-vehicle network. Locals would be able to earn extra money by carrying rocks to the fuel stations, rocks that would be used to build, repair, or maintain the roadways. In addition, every village would require a local road repair crew. Military application of steam road vehicles During the Crimean war (1853–1856) a traction engine was used to pull multiple open trucks. In the 1870s many armies experimented with steam tractors pulling road trains of supply wagons. By 1898 steam traction engine trains with up to four wagons were employed in military manoeuvres in England. In 1900 John Fowler & Co. provided armoured road trains for use by the British forces in the Second Boer War. Victorian Age of steam Although engineers developed ingenious steam-powered road vehicles, they did not enjoy the same level of acceptance and expansion as steam power at sea and on the railways in the middle and late 19th century of the \\"Age of steam\\". Ransomes built a portable steam engine, that is a farm steam engine on wheels, hauled from farm to farm by horses in 1841. The next year Ransomes automated it and had the engine drive itself to farms. Harsh legislation virtually eliminated mechanically propelled vehicles from the roads of Great Britain for 30 years, the Locomotive Act of 1861 imposing restrictive speed limits on \\"road locomotives\\" of 5 mph (8 km/h) in towns and cities, and 10 mph (16 km/h) in the country. In 1865 the Locomotives Act of that year (the famous Red Flag Act) further reduced the speed limits to 4 mph (6.4 km/h) in the country and just 2 mph (3.2 km/h) in towns and cities, additionally requiring a man bearing a red flag (red lantern during the hours of darkness) to precede every vehicle. At the same time, the act gave local authorities the power to specify the hours during which any such vehicle might use the roads. The sole exceptions were street trams which from 1879 onwards were authorised under licence from the Board of Trade. In France the situation was radically different from the extent of the 1861 ministerial ruling formally authorising the circulation of steam vehicles on ordinary roads. Whilst this led to considerable technological advances throughout the 1870s and 1880s, steam vehicles nevertheless remained a rarity. To an extent competition from the successful railway network reduced the need for steam vehicles. From the 1860s onwards, attention was turned more to the development of various forms of traction engine which could either be used for stationary work such as sawing wood and threshing, or for transporting outsize loads too voluminous to go by rail. Steam trucks were also developed but their use was generally confined to the local distribution of heavy materials such as coal and building materials from railway stations and ports. =Rickett of Buckingham Steam car= In 1854 Thomas Rickett of Buckingham built the first of several steam cars and in 1858 he built the second. Instead of looking like a steam car it resembled a small locomotive. It consisted of a steam engine mounted on three wheels: two large driven rear wheels and one smaller front wheel by which the vehicle was steered. The weight of the machine was 1.5 tonnes and somewhat lighter than Rickett's steam car. The whole was driven by a chain drive and a maximum speed of twelve miles per hour was reached. Two years later in 1860 Rickett built a similar but heavier vehicle. This model incorporated spur-gear drive instead of chain. In his final design resembling a railway locomotive, the cylinders were coupled directly outside the cranks of the driving-axle. =Roper Steam car= Roper and a steam car made sometime before 1870 Sylvester H. Roper drove around Boston, Massachusetts on a steam car he invented in 1863.See also: *\\"An improved steam carriage\\" Scientific American, new series, vol. 8, no. 11, page 165 (14 March 1863). *\\"New steam carriage\\" Scientific American, new series, vol. 9, no 22, page 341 (28 November 1863). One of his 1863 steam cars went to the Henry Ford Museum, where in 1972 it was the oldest car in the collection. Around 1867-1869 he built a steam velocipede, which may have been the first motorcycle. Roper died in 1896 of heart failure while testing a later version of his steam motorcycle. =Manzetti Steam car= In 1864 Italian inventor Innocenzo Manzetti built a road steamer. Innocenzo Manzetti - Le invenzioni It had the boiler at the front and a single cylinder engine. =Holt Road steamer= H.P. Holt constructed a small road steamer in 1866. Able to reach a speed of twenty miles per hour on level roads, it had a vertical boiler at the rear and two separate twin cylinder engines, each of which drove one rear wheel by means of a chain and sprocket wheels. =Taylor Steam buggy= Taylor's Steam buggy of 1867 In 1867 Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his four wheeled steam buggy at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec and again the following year.The Montreal Gazette - 18 Jan 1986 https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat;=19860118&id;=G4Y0AAAAIBAJ&sjid;=5KUFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3436,3937822 The basis of the buggy which he began building in 1865 was a high wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.\\"Canada's First Automobile: Full Steam Ahead\\" from the book \\"Whatever Happened To...?\\" by Mark Kearny & Randy Ray, Dundern Press, 2006 =Michaux- Perreaux Steam velocipede= Michaux-Perreaux Steam velocipede on display at The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Guggenheim in New York in 1998 Around 1867-1869 in France a Louis-Guillaume Perreaux commercial steam engine was attached to a Pierre Michaux metal framed velocipede, creating the Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede. Along with the Roper steam velocipede, it might have been the first motorcycle. The only Michaux-Perreaux Steam velocipede made is in the Musée de l'Île-de-France, Sceaux, and was included in The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in New York in 1998. =Knight of Farnham Steam carriage= In 1868-1870 John Henry Knight of Farnham built a four wheeled steam carriage which originally only had a single-cylinder engine. =Catley and Ayres of York Steam car= In 1869 a small three wheeled vehicle propelled by a horizontal twin cylinder engine which drove the rear axle by spur gearing, only one rear wheel was driven, the other turning freely on the axle. A vertical fire-tube boiler was mounted at the rear with a polished copper casing over the fire box and chimney, the boiler was enclosed in a mahogany casing. The weight was only 19 cwt and the front wheel was used for steering. =Thomson of Edinburgh Road steamer= Thomson's Road steamer with charcoal wagons (engraving of 1870) Robey's Road steamer built to Thomson's design In 1869 the road steamer built by Robert William Thomson of Edinburgh became famous because its wheels were shod with heavy solid rubber tyres. Thomson's first road steamers, manufactured in his own small workshop in Leith, were fitted with three wheels, the small single wheel at the front being directly below the steering wheel. The tyres, which were 125 mm (5\\") thick, were corrugated internally and adhered to the wheel by friction. He then turned to T. M. Tennant and Co of Bowershall Iron and Engine Works, Leith for their manufacture, but as they could not keep up with demand in 1870 some of the production was moved to Robey & Co of Lincoln.Head J, (1873 \\"On the Rise and Progress of Steam Locomotion on Common Roads.\\" Over the next two years Robeys built 32 of these vehicles, which were either 8 or 12 horse power versions. A large proportion were exported. These included one to Italy (for an experiment of public transport in Bergamo), three to Austria (Vienna) and others to Turkey, Australia, New Zealand, India, Ireland, Chile, Russia (Moscow) and Greece. A further Thomson steam vehicle was built in 1877, but apart from traction engines, Robeys appear to have discontinued making road steam vehicles until 1904, when they started manufacturing steam road lorries.Brooks R. (Undated, but 1988), Lincolnshire Engines Worldwide pg. 5, Lincolnshire Life Museum, Lincolnshire County Council. =Kemna of East- Prussia Road steamer= Kemna Steam plouging engine In 1871 Julius Kemna, a German industrialist, started selling English steam threshing systems. A couple of years later Kemna started producing various other steam-powered vehicles (such as road rollers) but also high quality steam ploughing engines and road steamers. =Randolph of Glasgow Steam bus= In 1872 a steam coach by Charles Randolph of Glasgow weighed four and a half tons, was in length, but had a maximum speed of only 6 miles per hour. Two vertical twin cylinder engines were independent of one another and each drove one of the rear wheels by spur gearing. The entire vehicle was enclosed and fitted with windows all around, carried six people, and even had two driving mirrors for observing traffic approaching from behind, the earliest recorded instance of such a device. =Bollée Steam bus= Bollée's L'Obéissante steam bus photographed in 1875 From 1873 to 1883 Amédée Bollée of Le Mans built a series of steam- powered passenger vehicles able to carry 6 to 12 people at speeds up to 60 km/h (38 mph), with such names as La Rapide, La Nouvelle, La Marie-Anne, La Mancelle and L'Obéissante. To L'Obeissante the boiler was mounted behind the passenger compartment with the engine at the front of the vehicle, driving the differential through a shaft with chain drive to the rear wheels. The driver sat behind the engine and steered by means of a wheel mounted on a vertical shaft. The lay out more closely resembled much later motor cars than other steam vehicles. Moreover, in 1873 it had independent suspension on all four corners., p.61. =Grenville of Glastonbury Steam car= Grenville's Steam car of 1875-1880 In 1875-1880 R. Neville Grenville of Glastonbury constructed a 3 wheeled steam vehicle which travelled a maximum of 15 miles per hour. This vehicle is still in existence, preserved for many years in the Bristol City Museum but since 2012 at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu. =Cederholm of Sweden Steam car= Cederholm's Steam car in 1892 In 1892 painter Joens Cederholm and his brother, André, a blacksmith, designed their first car, a two seater, introducing a condensor in 1894. It was not a success.G.N. Georgano Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985). =Shearer of South Australia Steam car= Shearer's Steam car in 1898 Starting in 1894 David Shearer designed and built the first car in Australia. It was capable of 15 miles per hour on the streets of Adelaide, South Australia. The boiler was his own design, being a horizontal boiler of the semi flash type. Steering was by a tiller type design and a photograph of the vehicle shows it carrying eight passengers. The news article on the car has a sectional drawing of the design.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/58525297http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/murray/content/didyouknow/shearerCar.htm The car's first official road trial was in 1899. =De Dion & Bouton Steam vehicles= :See steam tricycle The development by Léon Serpollet of the flash steam boilerCombe Jean-Marc & Escudier Bernard (1986, L'Aventure scientifique et technique de la vapeur, editions du CNRS, Paris, France brought about the appearance of various diminutive steam tricycles and quadricycles during the late 80s and early 90s, notably by de Dion and Bouton, these successfully competed in long distance races but soon met with stiff competition for public favour from the internal combustion engine cars being developed, notably by Peugeot, that quickly cornered most of the popular market. In the face of the flood of IC cars, proponents of the steam car had to fight a long rear guard battle that was to last into modern times. =Locomobile Company of America= Locomobile Steam car from a January 1901 advertisement This American firm bought the patents from the Stanley brothers and began building their steam buggies from 1898 to 1905. Locomobile Company of America went into building gas cars and lasted until the Depression. =Stanley Motor Carriage Company= In 1902 the twins Francis E. Stanley (1849–1918) and Freelan O. Stanley formed the Stanley Motor Carriage Company. They made famous models such as the 1906 Stanley Rocket, 1908 Stanley K Raceabout and 1923 Stanley Steam Car.Models of Stanley Motor Carriage Company Early to mid-20th century In 1906 the land speed record was broken by a Stanley steam car, piloted by Fred Marriott, which achieved 127 mph (203 km/h) at Ormond Beach, Florida. This annual week- long \\"Speed Week\\" was the forerunner of today's Daytona 500. This record was not exceeded by any land vehicle until 1910, and stood as the steam-powered world speed record till 25 August 2009. =Doble Steam car= Doble Model E steam car Attempts were made to bring more advanced steam cars on the market, the most remarkable being the Doble Steam Car which shortened start up time very noticeably by incorporating a highly efficient mono tube steam generator to heat a much smaller quantity of water along with effective automation of burner and water feed control. By 1923 Doble's steam cars could be started from cold with the turn of a key and driven off in 40 seconds or less.Walton J.N. (1965-74) Doble Steam cars, buses, lorries and railcars. \\"Light steam power\\" Isle of Man, UK. =Paxton Phoenix steam car= 1953 Paxton Phoenix steam car Abner Doble developed the Doble Ultimax engine for the Paxton Phoenix steam car, built by the Paxton Engineering Division of McCulloch Motors Corporation, Los Angeles. Its sustained maximum power was . The project was eventually dropped in 1954.\\"The True Story of the Paxton Phoenix.\\" Road and track, April 1957. pp. 13-18 =Decline of steam car development= Steam cars became less popular after the adoption of the electric starter, which eliminated the need for risky hand cranking to start gasoline-powered cars. The introduction of assembly-line mass production by Henry Ford, which hugely reduced the cost of owning a conventional automobile, was also a strong factor in the steam car's demise as the Model T was both cheap and reliable. Late 20th century =Renewed interest= In 1968 renewed interest was shown, sometimes prompted by newly available techniques. An older idea that was resurrected is to use a water tube generator with fire around it, as opposed to using fire tubes heating a boiler of water. A prototype car was built by Charles J. & Calvin E. Williams of Ambler, Pennsylvania. Other high-performance steam cars were built by Richard J. Smith of Midway City, California, and A.M. and E. Pritchard of Caulfeld, Australia. Companies/organisations as Controlled Steam Dynamics of Mesa, Arizona, General Motors, Thermo-Electron Corp. of Waltham, Massachusetts, and Kinetics Inc., of Sarasota, Florida all built high-performance steam engines in the same period. Bill Lear also started work on a closed circuit steam turbine to power cars and buses, and built a transit bus and converted a Chevrolet Monte Carlo sedan to use this turbine system. It used a proprietary working fluid dubbed Learium, possibly a chlorofluorocarbon similar to DuPont Freon.Ethridge. John. \\"PM takes a ride in tomorrow's bus, today.\\" Popular Mechanics, August 1972. Retrieved: 31 August 2011. In 1970 a variant of the steam car was made by Wallace L. Minto, which works on Ucon U-113 fluorocarbon as the working fluid instead of gasoline, kerosene and steam or the like as a fuel. The car was called the Minto car. =Land speed record= On 25 August 2009 a team of British engineers from Hampshire ran their steam-powered car \\"Inspiration\\" at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert, and averaged over two runs, driven by Charles Burnett III. The car was long and weighed , built from carbon fibre and aluminium and contained 12 boilers with over of steam tubing.

Duplicate poker is based on the principles of duplicate bridge, but it also incorporates some of the rules of pot limit and no limit Texas hold'em. While the game is more conducive to an automated online format because of pre-set decks and the scoring mechanic, duplicate poker has also been played in a live format. The first duplicate poker tournament was held in April 2007 at the Cherokee Casino in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Duplicatepoker.com, the first poker room to use the format, closed down on October 5, 2008, citing the global financial crisis as the reason for the removal of services. Duplicate poker versus standard poker Duplicate poker is a game in which there are two or more tables, each consisting of the same number of players. Each table uses hands dealt from an identically sequenced deck of cards. Each player holds the same hand as the person seated in identical seats at the other tables. Duplicate Poker was first devised by Californians Bruce Altshuler and Danny Kleinman who memorialized their concept in a lengthy article in Card Player Magazine in August of 1993. The article indicated that for Duplicate Poker to work in a multi-table format, each table had to have the same number of seats with no sit outs on any hand which could distort the final results. The winner would be the player who either won the most chips on a set number of hands and who lost the least amount of chips if the seat had a negative expectation. In theory, a player could win a duplicate poker tournament without winning many hands by avoiding big losses on hands that those holding the same cards at other tables play more recklessly. Under the original concept, Duplicate Poker was envisioned as a Limit game. A no limit or pot limit stake could only work at Duplicate Poker if the chips are re-set after every hand. A set number of hands are played in each round. In a multi-table tournament, the players can be assigned to different tables sitting at different seats after each round. Under Altshuler's and Kleinman's concept, a duplicate hold em team game could be held with a team of 4-9 members of each team each sitting at a different seat at a different table, and the team which ends up with the most chips would win. Duplicate poker can be played in Hold Em or Omaha where the final hands are fixed, but not in Stud, where a fold alters the order of the cards. The principal difference from playing standard poker is duplicate poker's measure of results, which are between players sitting at corresponding seats at other tables. Player performance is measured relatively to other players sitting in their parallel seat.Cardplayer.com: Duplicate Poker Looks to Change the Industry The object of duplicate poker is to win more chips than your opponents sitting in corresponding seats at other tables. The winner is the player who has accumulated the best total difference in chips vs. the players in the same seat at the other tables. Conceivably, even a player who loses chips overall can win at the game if that player loses fewer chips than his opponents. Under the format originally devised by Altshuler and Kleinman in their Card Player article, the team game would consist of up to 8 members, each team player sitting at a different seat at each of the tables. The number of tables would correspond to the number of players on each of the teams. Determining the result of the duplicate team is simple. The team with the most chips at the end of the event is the winner. Again, a limit stake format was envisioned for the team concept. SkillBet poker SkillBet.com launched in July 2012. In this version, two players, sitting at two identical tables, are dealt the same poker hand. They both play against the same five computer opponents. If one player wins $10 with a particular hand, but his opponent wins $15 with the same hand in the same situation, then he’s been outplayed to the tune of $5 for that hand and owes his opponent $5.Denverpost: New poker site claims to be legal in 28 states, including Colorado Duplicate Poker Nation's Cup In 2011, the International Federation of Poker (IFP) announced the \\"Duplicate Poker Nation's Cup.\\" From around the world, 72 players made up 12 national teams played within the isolation of the London Eye pods, ensuring that no information could be shared between tables. Those national teams were USA, UK, France, Spain, Germany, Brazil, Denmark, Japan, Ireland, Holland, Australia, plus a team from Zynga.  Recognition as a sport - 'Match Poker'  In April 2010, IFP secured provisional membership of the International Mind Sports Association (IMSA) at IMSA's annual congress in Dubai. In the years following the 2011 Duplicate Poker Nation's Cup, the IFP renamed their version of duplicate poker to 'Match Poker'. Their goal then became to \\"promote poker and its Match Poker™ variation as a skill game and a mind sport\\". Essentially the same game, the IFP describes Match Poker as \\"a team sport incorporating regular Texas Hold’em. Albeit typically with a pot-limit pre-flop and no-limit post-flop structure.\\" This team game was conceptually similar to that which was described by Altshuler and Kleinman in their 1993 article in Card Player Magazine. On October 2, 2017, Match Poker gained recognition as a sport. It now holds Observer Status with the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF). In response to this, the IFP changed its name to the IF _M_ P, to recognise that they are now proponents of the specific version of duplicate poker they call Match Poker. International Match Poker championships have been run by the IFMP since 2011, with the sport gaining popularity most notably in India via the Match Indian Poker League, launched jointly by the IFMP and Viann Industries Ltd (Raj Kundra's company). Under the authority of the IFMP, a team in Australia is now developing a mobile application called MATCHPOKER Online. The app will allow people to play duplicate poker (in the form of Match Poker) against players around the world on their personal devices. The app is expected to launch in beta phase in late 2020.

It is a member of the snow Apollo genus (Parnassius) of the swallowtail family (Papilionidae). Populations vary throughout its range and there are very many described subspecies. The adult flies from July to mid-August and the larvae feed on Sedum and Orostachys (Crassulaceae). Description Similar to Parnassius apollo geminus but differs in the vitreous marginal band of the forewing being broken up into elongate arched spots or lunules, and in the hindwing bearing dark marginal and more sharply marked submarginal spots, the latter being developed to large vitreous half moons, especially on the underside. The hindwing above usually with red basal spot, the whole surface of the wing above with a peculiar silky and below a greasy gloss. The female is darker, more conspicuously marked. Shaft of antenna whitish, club black, abdomen whitish, except a small dorsal portion. In specimens which agree with the figure of the name-type the costal and hind-marginal spots of the forewing are heavily centred with red.

Kurzweil's book From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your Jewish Genealogy and Family History is considered to be a definitive introductory guide on the topic. Kurzweil has also authored two books in the for Dummies series: Kabbalah for Dummies and The Torah for Dummies. His other books are On the Road with Rabbi Steinsaltz, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Genealogy and My Generations: A Course in Jewish Family History, which is commonly used as a textbook at synagogue schools in the United States. Career =In literature= Author Kurzweil's interest in writing formed early in his childhood. His first article, \\"Today's Troubled Youth: A Teenager's View\\", was published at the age of 15. It first appeared in Newsday and became nationally syndicated. It was included in the weekly current events reading supplement then commonly used in public schools in the United States. Kurzweil spent ten years working as a freelance writer, writing articles for numerous publications including Hadassah, National Jewish Monthly, Moment Magazine and L.I. (Newsday's Sunday magazine). He also contributed articles to The Jewish Almanac (1980), The Jewish Family Book: A Creative Approach to Raising Kids (1981), the three volumes comprising The Jewish Catalog (Jewish Publication Society in 1973, 1976 and 1980, a 1960's style compilation of do- it-yourself guides covering a wide range of topics of interest for Jewish people. Kurzweil contributed to articles about building a personal Jewish library, Judaica philately, and Jewish genealogy. His interest in genealogy coincided with the release of Alex Haley's book Roots: The Saga of an American Family and Catching the Wave in 1976. He wrote \\"Past Shock: How One Man Took a Journey Back into His Family's History\\", a feature article for L.I.. The publication of this article initiated his career as both a professional writer and a public speaker. His weekly column, Finding Jewish Roots, appeared in The Jewish Week, a Jewish newspaper in New York, in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, Kurzweil wrote a cover story for New York magazine, \\"Hizzoner's Roots\\", a genealogical study of former New York City Mayor Ed Koch's past. Motivated by his own confused and inconsistent treatment of New York City's numerous beggars, Kurzweil, in Brother, Can You Spare a Dime: The Treatment of Beggars According to Jewish Tradition, poses 16 questions reflecting his ambivalence on accommodating their seemingly relentless requests for a handout. He then demonstrates how a relative novice can do research to find meaningful answers within the framework of the Jewish tradition. From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your Jewish Genealogy and Family History was first published in 1980 and has since been published in a third revised edition. The book provides information on Kurzweil's own family history quest in addition to step-by-step advice on gathering information on one's family history from family members, family papers, Holocaust research, immigration and naturalization records, and online databases, among other sources. A revised and updated version of this book was published by Jossey-Bass in 2004. After an extended period of time during which Kurzweil's efforts were focused on publishing books by other authors, Kurzweil returned to his own writing, with books such as On the Road with Rabbi Steinsaltz: 25 Years of Pre-Dawn Car Trips, Mind-Blowing Encounters, and Inspiring Conversations with a Man of Wisdom in 2006, Kabbalah for Dummies in 2007 and The Torah for Dummies in 2008. In 2009, Jossey-Bass published Pebbles of Wisdom From Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz: Edited and with Notes by Arthur Kurzweil. It includes the internationally renowned rabbi's thoughts on the big topics of life and spirituality, culled from more than thirty years Rabbi Steinsaltz's lectures, writings, interviews, and conversations. Editor Kurzweil's credits as an editor include, Behold a Great Image: The Contemporary Jewish Experience in Photographs in 1978 co-edited with Sharon Strassfeld. The book which was awarded first prize for design at the Philadelphia Book Show, was developed as a fundraising program by a Tzedekah Collective, a grassroots charitable fundraising initiative. The book was the culmination of a national photography project that aimed at capturing the modern Jewish experience. The top three winners received cash prizes, and the proceeds from the book were donated to charity. Other books Kurzweil has edited include The Strife of the Spirit in 1988, On Being Free in 1995 both written by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, Best Jewish Writing 2003 and The Hadassah Jewish Family Book of Health and Wellness in 2006. Publisher From 1984 to 2001, Kurzweil acted as Editor-in-chief, publisher and Vice President at Jason Aronson Publishers during which time he published over 650 books on a wide range of topics pertaining to Jewish practice and belief. Notable authors that Kurzweil published include Adin Steinsaltz, Elie Wiesel, Shlomo Carlebach, Aryeh Kaplan, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Zalman Schachter-Shalomi. From 2001 he has served as Judaica Consultant for Jossey-Bass. Jewish book projects that Kurzweil develops for Jossey-Bass are imprinted with the words \\"An Arthur Kurzweil Book\\" on each book's title page. =Educator= As a speaker, teacher, and scholar-in- residence, Kurzweil's teachings have covered various topics of Jewish interest, including the Talmud, Kabbalah, and genealogy. His Kabbalah courses are frequently based upon the contemporary book by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, The Thirteen Petalled Rose: A Discourse on the Essence of Jewish Existence and Belief, which he has claimed has had more influence on his life than any other book. Among the various forums at which Kurzweil has lectured and taught are Jewish educator conferences, such as the Conference for Alternatives in Jewish Education (CAJE), retreat centers, such as Elat Chayyim, The Aleph Society where he is the acting coordinator for the Talmud Circle Project, synagogues, schools, Jewish community centers, teacher conferences, and university groups, both in the United States and abroad. As a prolific lecturer and teacher, Kurzweil has been credited as \\"one individual who has made a major contribution to the resurgence in adult Jewish education. =Genealogist= Kurzweil co-founded the first Jewish Genealogical Society in 1977 and was co- publisher with Steven W. Siegel of Toledot: The Journal of Jewish Genealogy (1977–1982). There are now over 80 Jewish Genealogical Societies worldwide. In 1999, Kurzweil was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies (IAJGS) His commemorative plaque read: \\"In deep appreciation of your trailblazing work which teaches us that learning about Jewish family history is possible, despite ages of community destruction, Diaspora and the Holocaust. We will always be grateful that you showed us the way, and for your past and continued inspiration to all Jewish genealogists and new Jewish genealogical societies that continue to be created worldwide because of your vision.\\" Kurzweil serves on the Honorary Advisory Board for the International Institute for Jewish Genealogy (IIJG) and also heads a working group that is developing ethical standards for Jewish genealogy. The IIJG is committed to developing Jewish genealogy into a recognized academic discipline, within the realm of Jewish Studies and in association with a broad range of other sciences on an interdisciplinary basis. =Magician= Kurzweil was introduced to magic by his father who took him to a magic shop to help with a third grade school project. His first magic trick, one that transformed a penny into a dime, was purchased for him by his father. Kurzweil belongs to the Society of American Magicians as well as the International Brotherhood of Magicians. Inspired by Project Magic, an effort to encourage physical therapists to use magic tricks as part of therapy founded by magician David Copperfield, Kurzweil has spent time teaching physical therapists how to use magic tricks as a rehabilitative tool. Although the Torah and Jewish authorities specifically prohibits \\"supernatural magic\\", tricks which rely upon sleight-of-hand and misdirection to fool the eye are permitted. Since 2004, Kurzweil has performed a Jewish- themed magic show, \\"Searching for God in a Magic Shop\\", that combines magic tricks and illusions with a spiritual message.

From 1944 to 1945, he was parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of National Insurance. Re-elected in the 1945 general election, he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Food, and served in this role until 1946. In 1947, in the course of an investigation by the parliamentary Committee of Privileges into claims that Labour members had given information to journalists about confidential meetings of the Labour Party in return for payment, Walkden admitted revealing information to the Evening News.

History The area corresponds to the central portion of the east-west flowing Loir valley. Before the French Revolution the area depended administratively on Vendôme and was part of the Orléanais province, but ecclesiastically on the Diocese of Le Mans in the Tours province. The division thus corresponds to that between the late Roman provinces of Tertia Lugdunensis (Tours) and Quarta Lugdunensis (Sens) and the civitates of the Cenomani and of the Carnutes respectively. The Bas-Vendômois was part of the Frankish kingdom of Neustria. The area was fought over during struggles between the Angevin Plantagenêts and the French monarchy. There are fortified castles at Montoire-sur-le-Loir and Lavardin. There are a number of Romanesque churches, e.g. Saint-Jacques-des- Guérets, the chapel of St. Giles at Montoire.

First established as the Catholic Prisoners Aid Society in 1898, pact works at several prisons across England and Wales.Prison Advice and Care Trust The charity runs a wide variety of services, including: family visitors' centres at prisons, offering information, advice and support to those visiting a prisoner; children's play services inside prison visits halls; 'first night in custody' support for new prisoners; pact lunch coffee bars at prisons; resettlement projects; and advice desks at courts. pact also campaigns for more government support for prisoners' families.Action for Prisoners' Families  History  Pact was established in 2001, as a result of the merger of the Bourne Trust and the Prisoners’ Wives and Families Society (PWFS).Rethinking Sentencing: a Contribution to the Debate Between them, the two organisations had 125 years’ experience of working with prisoners and their families. = Bourne Trust = The Bourne Trust started out as the Catholic Prisoners Aid Society. It was established in 1898 by two Catholic lawyers, and the original aim was to help Catholic prisoners – although in practice, help was offered to Catholics and non-Catholics alike. The Bourne Trust was based in London, but operated nationwide. It helped prisoners in all sorts of ways – for example, finding work for ex-prisoners and providing them with lodgings and food. In 1905, a medical doctor was appointed to see and examine discharged prisoners free of charge. By 1923, the Trust was helping nearly 1,000 prisoners a year – not only by providing practical aid, but also by linking them up with local churches, schools, hospitals and employers. In 1950, the Bourne Trust set up a scheme to help the families of prisoners. As soon as the person went to prison, their parish priest was contacted to see whether they had a family in need. If so, parish societies were enlisted to offer support and help the family to prepare for the prisoner’s return. Spiritual and material help continued after release. Over the years, the Trust tackled the problems of housing and homelessness with a number of innovative schemes. In 1966, the Trust formed the Hope Housing Association to alleviate the appalling conditions that some prisoners’ families were living in. The following year, funds were raised to erect a prefabricated building to accommodate young ex- offenders.alt= In 1990, the organisation changed its name to the Bourne Trust. This was in honour of Cardinal Bourne, the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, who had been the organisation’s president from 1903 – 1935.Prison Advice and Care Trust - Faith Zone = Prisoners Wives and Families Society (PWFS) = PWFS was set up in 1975 when a group of prisoners’ wives who had been meeting to discuss their problems and support one another decided to launch a self-help organisation. They opened a house near Pentonville Prison which offered a drop-in service and overnight accommodation for people visiting London prisoners. Founder member Pauline Hoare recalls: \\"My incentive was to give something back. Because my parents had been so terrific, so supportive, when my own husband went to prison, I had to do something. There was nothing around for prisoners’ families and I knew that there were women out there who didn’t have a supportive family. PWFS was the first ever self-help organisation for prisoners’ families.\\" PWFS established a telephone helpline, which took up to 3,000 calls a year. In 1994, shocked by the sight of prisoners’ wives and children lining up along the prison wall at HMP Pentonville within feet of thundering cars and lorries, PWFS persuaded the prison to give up a small room for use as a visitors’ centre. = Merger = The idea for a merger of the Bourne Trust and PWFS was first floated in 1999. In 2001, the two organisations merged and became the Prison Advice and Care Trust (Pact). Today, Pact works at approx. 70 prisons across England & Wales. pact's services are open to anyone who needs them, regardless of their faith.  Visitors' centres  Not every prison has a visitors' centre, and of those that do, some are run by the prison itself and some are run by independent voluntary organisations such as Pact.Prisoners' Families Helpline factsheets Pact runs visitors' centres at 14 prisons across the England. The centres are for prisoners' families, friends, and legal visitors - anyone who is visiting an inmate at that prison. The aim of pact visitors' centres is to provide information, support and advice, and a safe, child-friendly environment where people can wait and relax. Their centres are staffed by a combination of paid staff and volunteers.What Can I Do? Your Guide to Volunteering Opportunities in the Criminal Justice System  Children's play services  Pact playworkers (a mixture of staff and volunteers) run children's play areas inside some prison visits halls, providing toys and activities for children visiting a relative inside. The aim of their children's play provision is reduce the feelings of fear and anxiety that can be experienced by children visiting a prison.  First Night in Custody services  In 2001, pact set up a pioneering First Night in Custody project at Holloway Prison, offering one-to- one emotional support to anxious people on their first night in jail. A few years later, the project was expanded to HMP Exeter in Devon and HMP Wandsworth in London. The aims of the First Night in Custody project are: to reduce the likelihood of new prisoners attempting suicide or self-harming during the first 72 hours; and to reduce the anxiety faced by prisoners and their families. First Night in Custody workers and volunteers sit down one-to- one with new prisoners, listen to their concerns, and often contact relatives on their behalf. They provide practical and emotional support. In 2007, an independent study conducted by the Prison Reform Trust found that \\"in the prisons working with pact, people tended to experience fewer difficulties and less frustration in making contact with family than those in the comparison prisons... The specific services that pact provides in liaising with families should be replicated more widely and local prisons may wish to draw on pact’s expertise in developing their first night services.\\"Prison Reform Trust report: There When You Need Them Most (2007)  Basic Caring Communities  The Basic Caring Communities scheme is a resettlement programme for ex- offenders. It involves a group of volunteers (often motivated by their faith) who meet regularly with the ex-offender and help him or her making a fresh start in their life. One volunteer calls the ex-offender every day on the phone to discuss how things are going.  Campaigning  In 2007, pact formed an alliance with the Prison Reform Trust, Action for Prisoners' Families and Clinks to campaign for more help for prisoners' families. A joint Agenda for Action was launched at the House of Lords in December 2007, with 30 recommendations for government, ranging from family-friendly visitors' centres to radically improved prison visits booking lines.  Well-known supporters  The President of the charity is the Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. pact's Ambassador are former Chief Inspector of Prisons Lord David Ramsbotham and Lord Woolf, former Lord Chief Justice.

This relatively new surgical technique is used for the early diagnosis and immediate treatment of a number of disorders of the female reproductive organs and can be considered one of the first standard NOTES (Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery) procedures. A large body of published research is available on the application of this surgical technique using the device. Fertiloscopy provides a minimally invasive, potentially office-based procedure for the clear diagnosis of two major causes of infertility in a manner enabling rational choices at the start of infertility treatment.

Volume 10, Number 3  Literature review  The published evidence into the use of Fertiloscopy falls into two categories; those studies linked with the original research into the technique itself, and the later (post 2002) evaluations of the product after it was fully developed. #The original technique was a development of a surgical procedure called culdoscopy which was widely used in the 1960s and 1970s. This was a transvaginal technique performed via the vagina with a conventional laparoscope. This fell out of general use, in most countries most probably because culdoscopy could not offer any advantages over laparoscopy #Campo, Broesens, Gordts and Watrelot were among the first to propose and report on the development of a standardised procedure of \\"transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy\\" and a special instrument for it - initially a modified reusable laparoscope.Watrelot A., Gordts S., Andine J.P., Brosens I.

He included in the device a conventional hysteroscope so that the total procedure includes not only the transvaginal laparoscopy, but also hysteroscopy, and the so-called \\"laparoscopy and dye\\" test for tubal patency. This device became known as the Fertiloscope and from it is derived the name for the current technique that uses it; Fertiloscopy. There is a recent review of alternative methods of assessing tubal patency by Papaioannou, Afnan and Jafettas in 2007 that makes clear that \\"lap and dye\\" is the gold standard procedure for assessing tubal patency.S.

Service de Gynécologie-Obstétrique, Hôpital Antoine Beclere, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Clamart, France.  Rationale  If, for the purposes of this discussion, female infertility is considered the main issue (while also considering male infertility where it relates to this particular subject), the huge majority of subfertile women suffer from either: #Problems of ovulation (30-40%), #Tubo-peritoneal abnormalities such as: tubal blockage (15%), tubo-ovarian adhesions (20%), abnormal tubal mucosa with patent tubes (20%) #Abnormalities in the uterine cavity (10%) Note that the percentages add up to more than 100% because of overlap where a single patient may suffer from more than one problem In order to deal with all these causes, there are four main categories of treatment: #Stimulation of the ovaries, starting usually with clomiphene, and then if unsuccessful, quickly moving to gonadotropins, which are more effective #IVF (or ICSI if there is also a male problem) #Corrective (laparoscopic) surgery of the pelvic organs #Corrective surgery of uterine abnormalities (hysteroscopically or laparoscopically) For any woman, the correct choice of treatment depends on correctly identifying the problem. However, although there are diagnostic procedures that make it possible to make rational choices between these treatments, the full range of these tests is rarely carried out at the start of treatment. As a result, many women receive inappropriate treatment, and only achieve pregnancy after unnecessary delay, and after many cycles of inappropriate treatment that was, in fact, doomed to fail from the start. Fertiloscopy makes it possible to simultaneously identify, in any women, the case for either: * Conservative treatment by either continuation of normal intercourse or IUI * IVF, or * Corrective surgery  Methods of diagnosis without fertiloscopy  At the present time, the initial diagnostic testing that is carried out is limited. Diagnosis of ovulatory problems is routinely carried out at an early stage and is not mentioned further in this paper. Physical abnormalities of the fallopian tubes, including blockage and mucosal damage, and in the pelvic cavity, including endometriosis and adhesions, are not generally subjected to a comprehensive diagnosis in most countries. The same applies to uterine abnormalities. The normal diagnostic practice is as follows: #Blockage of the fallopian tubes is mainly diagnosed today by hysterosalpingography (HSG) or Hystero Contrast Sonography (HyCoSy) in which either X-ray contrast media or aqueous fluid are forced up the fallopian tube to create an image on X-ray or ultrasound. This image demonstrates (or excludes) the possibility for sperm to swim up and for ova to migrate downwards. #:In earlier times, a technique known as a \\"Laparoscopy and Dye\\" (Lap and Dye) test was used in which dye was forced up the fallopian tube and its presence observed in the pelvic cavity during laparoscopic surgery. #:The literature indicates that HSG has very poor predictive value (15% false positives and 30-35% false negatives). The relative merits of these techniques are currently being debated, but for the purposes of this document the important point is that they only diagnose the presence of a passage through the tube, and give little information about the condition of the tubal mucosa. #:Again, the paper by Papaiannou, Afnan and Jafettas makes useful reading in this regard.S. Papaioannou, M. Afnan, J. Jafettas.

Symposium: Tubal disease and fertility outcome. \\"Tubal assessment tests: still have not found what we are looking for.\\" Vol 15. No 4. 2007 376-382 Reproductive BioMedicine Online #There is no convenient method for assessing the condition of the tubal mucosa (Salpingoscopy), which in theory could be carried out during laparoscopy. This is because the point of entry to the abdomen for conventional laparoscopy is such that the distal end of the fallopian tube points away from the point of entry, and is thus inaccessible. Thus Salpingoscopy can only be carried out if a second laparoscope is inserted in a different place, requiring two complete sets of equipment. For this reason the technique is unsuitable for routine use #Moreover, even if Salpingoscopy is carried out in individual cases, the macroscopic examination is not fully revealing. It has been found that, on microscopic examination, cellular damage can often be seen in cases where the macro structures are intact. Obviously, this technique is not routinely used, for the same reasons as apply to Salpingoscopy #:This means that, at the present time tubal patency is diagnosed rather inaccurately with HSG or HyCoSy, but very few patients are assessed for the condition of their mucosa in spite of the fact that damaged mucosa affect more patients than have blocked tubes. #In relation to other pelvic organs, some abnormalities (such as myomas and some cases of endometriosis) can be identified by ultrasound, but other endometriosis and adhesions can only be identified by laparoscopy. The problem is that ultrasound does not find all of these (especially adhesions), and laparoscopy (as previously stated) is too costly and traumatic to be commonly employed as a primary diagnostic tool in the early stages of assessment #A full hysteroscopy is not often carried out. As a result, the possibility of uterine abnormalities is not normally assessed at the outset of treatment The overall conclusion is that: #The most important pelvic abnormalities are never diagnosed in the early stages of assessment #The state of the fallopian tubes is only incompletely assessed, and therefore #No rational choice can be made between: expectant management or IUI; tubal surgery; surgery for removal of endometriosis and/or adhesions; surgical treatment of uterine abnormalities, or IVF/ICSI  The fertiloscopy procedure  Fertiloscopy combines Lap and Dye, Salpingoscopy and Microsalpingoscopy (MSC) and Hysteroscopy in two instruments presented as a single kit. It uses for the entire procedure a single narrow scope (Hamou 2, from Storz or equivalent) that has a 30-degree chamfer which enables a panoramic view by rotating the scope, and a zero to 100X magnification controlled by a rotating knurled knob: #The basis of the procedure is a laparoscopy performed under local anaesthesia via the vagina and the pouch of Douglas rather than via the abdominal wall and the peritoneal cavity. The benefit of this route of entry for the patients is that the procedure is minimally invasive, with no scar. Because it is carried out under local anaesthesia it is well accepted by patients who can go home in two hours. #:The doctor can carry out the procedure with a single hand, which can lead to savings in time and cost. Fertiloscopy is deemed to be safe because of the use of saline solution instead of Carbon dioxide, because of no requirement to use the head down position, and because the procedure is carried out entirely below the peritoneum, eliminating the risk of peritonitis if the bowel is inadvertently punctured. In addition the procedure is carried out without disturbing the position of the internal organs, thus allowing the detection of abnormalities normally not seen during conventional laparoscopy. #:Published data show that injury to major blood vessels is practically impossible and there are very few other minor complications when performed in the right manner. This one risk has been reported: that if a thorough physical examination of the pelvic space between vagina and rectum is not carried out, and if in fact the patient has severe endometriosis causing a fixed retroverted uterus, then there is a risk of rectal puncture. Proper training in the technique makes sure that patients with severe endometriosis and fixed retroverted uterus are excluded, and this minimises this risk. The paper by Nohuz, Pouly, Bolandard, Rabishong, Jardon, Cotte, Rivoire and Mage (2006) confirms this Nohuz E, Pouly J-L, Bolandard F, Rabischong B, Jardon K, Cotte B, Rivoire C, & Mage G. Fertiloscopie: l'expérience clermontais. Gynécologie Obstétrique Fértilité 34, 894-899. 2006. #During the procedure, dye is introduced via the uterus into the fallopian tube and observed appearing (or not) in the pouch of Douglas. MSC is then performed using the same scope as for the laparoscopic investigation in order to identify and assess damage to the mucosa. The natural position of the tubes allows an easy approach (unlike the Lap and Dye procedure) #At the end of the procedure a full hysteroscopy is performed Published papers show that Fertiloscopy, even without its inherent salpingoscopy, is fully equivalent to full laparoscopic investigation. The most important of these is by Watrelot, Nisolle, Chelli, Hocke, Rongieres, Racinet (2003).Watrelot A, Nisolle M, Chelli H, Hocke C, Rongieres C, Racinet C; International Group for Fertiloscopy Evaluation.

Is laparoscopy still the gold standard in infertility assessment? A comparison of fertiloscopy versus laparoscopy in infertility. Results of an international multicentre prospective trial: the 'FLY' (Fertiloscopy-Laparoscopy) study. But because the full procedure includes a dye test and full salpingoscopy/microsalpingoscopy, it produces all the information that could only otherwise be provided by a combination of HSG, plus Lap and Dye, plus Salpingoscopy and Microsalpingoscopy. As we have previously discussed, such a combination is not otherwise practicable, and is never performed. Clinical decisions following fertiloscopy #When the fallopian tube is abnormal, the modern tendency is to choose IVF in all cases, but formerly it was the practice to repair the tubes where possible by surgery. This remains a rational option for a number of reasons: firstly the procedure is cheaper than IVF and secondly, if successful, it permits as many future pregnancies as desired, whereas IVF has to be used for every future pregnancy. #The problem here is that HSG or HyCoSy do not provide sufficient information to make an informed choice between either \\"expectant management or IUI\\", and \\"tubal surgery or IVF\\", or (in the latter case) between tubal surgery and IVF. Currently, this would only be achieved by a laparoscopic inspection, and as we have seen, this is not normally performed #Under what we may now call the \\"Fertiloscopy paradigm\\" if the Dye test does not produce a good flow of dye into the pouch of Douglas, or if the mucosa show the characteristic staining patterns associated with damage, then the patient will rarely become pregnant using IUI. #Similarly, patients with significant adhesions or endometriosis are unlikely to become pregnant using IUI. #For these people (40% of the total), a choice is required between immediate IVF, or pelvic surgery followed by either expectant management, IUI or IVF as appropriate. There are clear criteria for this decision, as described in the literature #If none of these are seen, the patient is treated expectantly or by IUI as appropriate. This applies to approximately 60% of patients in developed countries.  Consequences of these decisions  The consequences of these decisions can only be judged in relation to the standard model of assessment and treatment prevailing in any country at a particular time. The \\"standard model\\" in general use in Europe in 2007 is three cycles of IUI in alternate menstrual cycles, followed by IVF if the IUI is unsuccessful. If we compare what occurs on average to the people in each of the four treatment groups above between the standard model and the fertiloscopy model, we see the following: #In the IVF group, under fertiloscopy they would achieve the normal pregnancy rate of 30% per cycle, starting in cycle 1. But in the standard group they would receive three unsuccessful cycles of IUI in six months before moving to IVF and then achieving 30% per cycle #In the surgery group (whether tubal surgery or removal of endometriosis/adhesions), under fertiloscopy they would achieve 10-20% pregnancies per cycle with natural intercourse, and then (if not pregnant after 6–12 months depending on the age of the patient) move to IVF with 30% pregnancies per cycle, whereas in the standard group they would achieve no pregnancies in three cycles of IUI in six months before moving to IVF and then achieving 30% pregnancies per cycle #In the \\"expectant or IUI\\" treatment group, there will be no difference between a group diagnosed by fertiloscopy and a group without. For both, the pregnancy rate per cycle would be 10%, the same as in the standard group. Both would move to IVF after three unsuccessful cycles with 30% pregnancies per treatment cycle The overall impact of this is that whereas fertiloscopy makes no difference to the people who are normal (in that nothing is discovered by fertiloscopy), for the other 45% it makes a big difference because they immediately receive the treatment they need, and have a chance of becoming pregnant immediately, whereas without fertiloscopy they would have to go through three cycles of IUI without effect before being offered IVF (which might not be the ideal treatment in any case).

The regulations do not apply to any project planned before 6 April, if construction work commenced before 1 July 2008, and apply only to projects in England. The Site Waste Management Plans Regulations were repealed by Government on 1 December 2013 following a consultation, as part of the Government's initiative to reduce red tape. They applied to all projects with a value of £300,000 or more, with additional updating requirements for projects with a value of £500,000 or more. The regulations placed the initial responsibility for the production of the plan with the client. The client had to produce the plan before the project was started. If a project was started without a site waste management plan, then both the client and the principal contractor were guilty of an offence under these regulations. The regulations also laid out what the plan had to include. Requirements for a site waste management plan The plan must identify: * The client * The principal contractor * The person who drafted it * The location of the site * The estimated cost of the project It must record any decision made in order to minimise the quantity of waste produced on site before the plan was drafted. It must: * Describe each waste expected to be produced * Estimate the quantity of each type of waste * Identify the waste management action for each type of waste including re-using, recycling, recovery of disposal. It must also contain a declaration that both the client and the principal contractor will comply with the requirements of duty of care and that materials will be handled efficiently and waste managed appropriately. Updating the plan Once the project starts then the regulations place an obligation on the principal contractor to update the plan. If the project has a value of they must record details of the identity of the person removing the wastes, the types of waste removed and the site the waste is being taken to. They must also, within three months of the completion of the project, add a confirmation that wastes have been monitored and the plan updated to reflect any changes along with an explanation of any deviation from the plan. If the project is worth more than £500,000, then these requirements include further, more clearly defined, duty of care information. The principal contractor must also: * Review the plan * Record quantities and types of waste produced * Record the types and quantities of waste that have been: ** Reused (on or off site) ** Recycled (on or off site) ** Sent of other forms of recovery (on or off site) ** Sent to landfill ** Otherwise disposed of * Update the plan to reflect the progress of the project Within three months of the work being completed the principal contractor must add to the plan: * Confirmation that the plan has been monitored and updated in accordance with the regulation * A comparison of estimated quantities of each type of waste generated against the actual quantities of each waste type * An explanation of any deviation from the plan * An estimate of the cost savings that have been achieved by completing and implementing the plan. The principal contractor must ensure that the plan is kept on site, and every contractor knows where it is kept. It must be available to any contractor carrying any work described in the plan. The principal contractor must retain the plan for two years following the completion of the project. Additional duties In addition to the requirements laid out in the regulations the client and principal contractor must, so far as is reasonably practicable, comply with a number of additional duties laid out in the schedule to the regulations. These include: * Ensuring cooperation between contractors during the construction phase. * Induction, information and training for every worker, with respect to the site waste management plan. * Ensuring that waste produced is reused, recycled or recovered There are also a number of other requirements relating to joint responsibilities for both the client and principal contractor. Failure to comply with this schedule is also an offence. Enforcement and penalties The Environment Agency and local government or council enforcement officers will enforce these regulations. A person found guilty of an offence is liable, on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50,000 or on indictment to an unlimited fine. Where a corporate body is guilty of an offence, individual liability also applies to directors, managers and other persons acting in a similar capacity. The enforcement body may also issue a £300 fixed penalty notice if any person fails to produce a site waste management plan or any other record when required to do so by an enforcement officer.

Populations range from Siberia and the Far East of Russia to the western Chukchi Peninsula, Mongolia and north China. The larva feeds on Corydalis species. In the northern part of its range it is a low altitude butterfly; further south it is montane. Description The forewing length is 17–31 mm; the wings have a white ground colour, often with a yellowish tint, and in females with a dark suffusion. The pattern consists of small separate black spots or strokes. Reddish or yellowish spots on the hindwings are elongate and to some extent stretched along the veins and may be reduced. The small sphragis is irregular in shape. The eggs are white and glossy, with a fine cell sculpture. The shape is hemispheric with a dimple at the apex. The larva is dark brown with a row of pale-orange spots along the dorsum and two similar lateral rows on either side. Description by Adalbert Seitz (1909): =Subspecies= * Parnassius tenedius britae Bryk, 1932 East Siberia smaller size, in females there are a yellowish tint on the wings and the greyish marginal spots on the hindwings are fused into a continuous margin about 2 mm wide. * Parnassius tenedius scepticus Bryk & Eisner, 1932 Described from Pribaikalye and the Stanovoe Nagorye upland * Parnassius tenedius vulcanus Bryk & Eisner, 1932 Described from Altai (= sceptica Bryk in Korshunov & Gorbunov, 1995) Biology P. tenedius is found where the food plant Corydalis (Corydalis capnoides in Altai) grows, that is in open forests and other places with disturbed soil. In Southern Siberia it occurs in the upper part of the forest belt at altitudes of 1000–2600 m, in Northern Siberia it occurs in valleys. The butterflies fly only in warm sun and when the sun disappears they rest with the wings spread on the ground or on stones. In Altai adults have been observed feeding on the flowers of Iris humilis. Eggs are laid singly. Often several eggs are laid on (sometimes in a row of 5-7) one young Corydalis or near it. The larvae hatch 7–10 days after oviposition. They pupate in the middle of the summer, the pupae hibernate. In Altai adults are found in late April to late June, in the mountains of Northeast Siberia adults emerge later from May until July.Korshunov & Gorbunov, 1995 Dnevnye babochki Aziatskoi chasti Rossii.

V.)  The European Technology Platform on Smart Systems Integration (EPoSS) is a European Seventh Framework Programme initiative to improve the competitive situation of the European Union in the field of Smart Systems Technologies and integrated Micro and Nanosystems. The programme is a joint initiative (Public- Private Partnership) of the European Commission, representing the European Communities, and the industry. EPoSS, the European Technology Platform on Smart Systems Integration, is an industry-driven policy initiative, defining R&D; and innovation needs as well as policy requirements related to Smart Systems Integration and integrated Micro- and Nanosystems. EPoSS is an international non-profit association according to German law. The EPoSS Association was founded on 18 September 2013. Its structure consists of Board, General Assembly, Executive Committee, Working Groups and Office (EPoSS structure). A group of major industrial companies and research organisations (EPoSS Members) from more than 20 European Member States intend to co-ordinate their activities in the field of Smart Systems Integration. A main objective is to develop a vision and to set up a Strategic Research Agenda (SRA). EPoSS brings together European private and public stakeholders in order to create an enduring basis for structuring initiatives, for co-ordinating and bundling efforts, for setting up sustainable structures of a European Research Area on Smart Systems Integration. EPoSS embraces all key players, public and private, in the value chain so as to: * provide a common European approach on Innovative Smart Systems Integration from research to production, outlining the key issues for a strategic European innovation process, * define priorities for common research and innovation in the future, * formulate commonly agreed road maps for action (updating, assembling and completing existing material and approaches) and provide a strategic R&D; agenda, and * mobilise public and private human, infrastructural and financial resources. The initiative is of immediate importance in view of defining research and technology priorities for the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, for raising more critical mass as well as resources and for coordinating different initiatives (national, regional, EUREKA, European public funding and industry). EPoSS is a strategic partner of the European Platform for Sport Innovation.  Smart Systems and Smart Systems Integration  Smart Systems affect many aspects of our lives. They are bringing a new generation of diagnostic instruments to clinics. They are bringing innovative automatic safety systems to cars and public transport. They are becoming embedded into consumer goods, into the networks that power and inform society, and they are underpinning the efficient provision of public and private services. Increasingly they sense their surroundings, operate autonomously and collaborate with other Smart Systems. Smart technologies promise to break the “faster, smaller, cheaper” circle that has for decades now characterised hi- tech commerce and forced the migration of commodity manufacture towards low- cost economies. The reason for this potential break is that Smart Systems extract and condense human skills and knowledge to add not only functionality but also value to products: value that is the skill, knowledge and has historically been the genius of European culture. A smart medical diagnostic stand-alone instrument encapsulates the skills and expertise of a whole laboratory to provide value far in excess of its component parts. Likewise smart safety systems and smart networks deliver a broad range of expertise, care and attention continuously, tirelessly and invisible to the user. Smart Systems Integration is an assembly of technologies that build products from components, that combine functions in products and systems, that connect and network systems to other systems, and, importantly, enable systems to receive and store a “knowledge base” – the software that makes them “Smart”. Bringing this set of technologies together is far more ambitious than the “faster, smaller, cheaper” objectives of the past. It needs a concerted effort from education and on through research and development, product design and manufacture, all the way to the development of new business models and markets: a whole “Ecosystem” to nurture competitive advantage for the European Smart Systems community.  EPoSS SRA  The connection between Smart Systems and the many application sectors they serve has been emphasized in the Strategic Research Agendas of EPoSS. Smart Systems combine cognitive functions with sensing, actuation, data communication and energy management in an integrated way. The enabling principles of these functions include nanoelectronics, micro-electromechanics, magnetism, photonics, chemistry and radiation. Smart systems are often integrated into the (natural, built and social) environment, networks for power and data and other smart systems. It is a sufficient (or extrinsic) condition for the smartness of a system to provide (and use) cognitive support to (and from) its surroundings. The EPoSS SRA is a reference document that provides an executive review of the main issues around Smart Systems, then continues with ten self-contained “Mini SRAs” describing the particular issues, prospects, timescales and research priorities of seven application sectors and three cross-sector domains. The seven applications sectors are Transport & Mobility; Health & Beyond; Manufacturing / Factory Automation; Communications; Energy; Aerospace; Smart Systems for the Environment. The three cross-sector domains are Safety, Security & Reliability; Technologies Supporting Smart Systems; and Production Processes for Smart Systems.

On 14 August 1867 Pope Pius IX restored it shortly as the Diocese of Coro y Barquisimeto from the suppressed Diocese of Barquisimeto, joining both titles. Coro was once again suppressed as a see and title when the diocese's name and see were changed back to the Diocese of Barquisimeto on 22 October 1869.

Life Dirk ter Haar was born at Oosterwolde in the province Friesland in the north of the Netherlands on 19 April 1919. He studied physics at the University of St Andrews in Scotland and Oxford University in England, obtaining an MA degree before carrying out postgraduate studies at Leiden University. In 1946 he was a research fellow of Niels Bohr at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen (now the Niels Bohr Institute), and received his PhD in Leiden in 1948 from Hendrik Kramers for a dissertation on the origin of the Solar System. From 1947 to 1950 he was a visiting associate professor of physics at Purdue University. In 1950 he obtained a post as professor of physics at the University of St. Andrews, and later became a British citizen. In 1952 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Jack Allen, David Jack, Daniel Edwin Rutherford and Edward Thomas Copson. He became a Fellow and Senior Tutor of Magdalen College, Oxford and Reader in theoretical physics at the University of Oxford. In 1966 Ter Haar became a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Many prominent scientists studied under Ter Haar, including Anthony Leggett, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2003, and Deng Jiaxian, one of the leading scientists and founders of Chinese nuclear weapons programs. Dirk could read Russian, and played a prominent role in disseminating the works of Soviet physicists such as Landau and Kapitsa to the western world. He also translated the classic monograph Quantum Mechanics by Alexander Davydov into English. He retired from his positions at Oxford in 1986, and died at Drachten in the northern Netherlands on 3 September 2002. Family In 1949 Dirk ter Haar married Christine Janet Lound and together they had two sons and a daughter. His daughter, Gail ter Haar, became a reader in physics as well, specializing in therapeutic ultrasound. Works He wrote numerous books on physics, such as Elements of Statistical Mechanics (1954). In addition, he wrote a book on Kramers and was a founding editor for Physics Letters (1962) (later Physics Letters A) and Physics Reports (1971). In 1984 the book Essays in Theoretical Physics in honour of Dirk ter Haar was published in honour of his work in statistical physics and quantum mechanics. * D. ter Haar, Elements of Statistical Mechanics.

Norie began his career working with William Heather, who had in 1765 taken over chart publishers Mount and Page and who ran the Naval Academy and Naval Warehouse in Leadenhall Street from 1795; the Naval Warehouse provided navigational instruments, charts, and books on navigation. Norie took over the Naval Warehouse after Heather's retirement and founded the company J.W. Norie and Company in 1813. After Norie's death the company became Norie and Wilson, then in 1903 Imray, Laurie, Norie & Wilson. Charles Dickens later used the Naval Warehouse in Dombey and Son. Jack London mentions Norie's 'Epitome' in Chapter 5 of his novel Martin Eden, and C. S. Forester refers to it in Chapter 17 in the book The Commodore of the Horatio Hornblower series of novels.

DMMO was founded by Dr. Robert L. Larsen and Douglas Duncan in 1973.Egel and Smith, p. 24 During its annual summer opera festival, the Company performs three mainstage operas in rolling repertory during June and July. Although created as an opera company for the Midwest, the company's audience base has grown over the years. As of 2016 it claims audiences from some 40 states and several foreign countries. The company also sends its educational arm, Opera Iowa, to sites throughout the state from fall through spring. Typically a troupe of several singers, a pianist and technical director, Opera Iowa has also traveled for educational performances in nine neighboring states and participated in exchange programs with like organizations in Japan and China.Egel and Smith, p. 28 Management Although the running of DMMO has passed down through the hands of several business managers over the years, from its inception in 1973 through the 2010 season, Dr. Robert L. Larsen was the sole guiding artistic force for the company. In this capacity, he selected the operas (subject to Board approval), cast all principal singers and apprentices, and both directed and conducted each performance. In addition, he created scene assignments for all apprentices, which are performed publicly as an aspect of their educational activities. In the fall of 2010 Michael Egel was appointed Artistic Director to replace Robert Larsen, and was named General Director in 2013. David Neely was appointed Music Director and Principal Conductor in 2012. Larsen remains with the company as Director Emeritus in a lifetime appointment. Since 2013, the esteemed Apprentice Artist Program has been run by Lisa Hasson. Programming Most of DMMO's opera productions are performed at the Blank Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of Simpson College. With 467 seats arranged in a semicircle, the Blank Center provides an intimate setting for opera. This intimacy is enhanced by an unusual stage design which features a semicircular stage in front of the orchestra pit, in addition to the traditional proscenium stage behind the orchestra pit. This semicircular stage, or \\"playing circle\\", is separated from the front row of audience seats by only a railing. Bridges crossing over the orchestra on each side allow performers to move between the two stage areas. Occasionally, DMMO has presented productions at a larger venue, the Civic Center in Des Moines. In 1986 DMMO premiered a new opera based on Shakespeare's The Tempest with music by Lee Hoiby and a libretto by Mark Shulgasser.Rockwell, John, \\"Opera: Hoiby's The Tempest in Iowa\\", The New York Times, 12 July 1986 The opera was broadcast on Iowa Public Television. Initially committed to producing opera in English, DMMO first presented a foreign-language production, Tosca, in 1998 at the Civic Center in Des Moines. Egel and Smith, p. 27 Since then, the company's season typically includes one opera in English and two operas in other languages (Italian, German, French, Russian or Czech), all presented with supertitles. The season also usually includes an opera written in the twentieth century. Singers and the apprentice program Singers who had their start at DMMO include: John Osborn, Kimm Julian, Jane Redding, Beverly Thiele, Theodore Green, Fernando del Valle and Lauren Flanigan. An important function of the Des Moines Metro Opera is its apprentice program (The James M. Collier Apprentice Artist Program). Every summer the program affords approximately forty young singers an opportunity to study the work of seasoned performers and to work with opera coaches and directors. The apprentice artists perform in the chorus, prepare short scenes, and in some cases understudy principal singers and perform small solos in main-stage productions. More than 1,000 singers have passed through the apprentice program since its inception in 1975.  Productions outside the standard opera repertory  In addition to one or two productions from the standard reportory each season, the company has presented many that are either new or rarely performed. These include: *1973: Albert Herring, B. Britten; Prima Donna, A. Benjamin; The Medium, G.C. Menotti *1974: The Crucible, R. Ward *1975: The Rake's Progress, I. Stravinsky *1976: Susannah, C.

The regiment saw service during the Second World War, and after Operation Polo was incorporated into the Indian Army as the Kumaon Regiment. Second World War The 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1939, consisted of four regular battalions; the 1st (Russell's), 2nd (Berar), 4th and The Kumaon Rifles. The 19th expanded during the war adding another eight battalions to the 19th Hyderabad Regiment. Two more battalions from Hyderabad, (not to be mistaken with the 19th Hyderabads) the 1st and 2nd Hyderabad Infantry were raised as part of the Indian State Forces. The battalions of the 19th Hyderabad Regiment fought in the Middle East, North Africa, Persia, Malaya, Singapore and Burma. The Kumaon Rifles were based in Hong Kong at the beginning of the War but were transferred to the Middle East as part of the 24th Indian Infantry Brigade. The battalion took part in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941 under Major-General William Slim. They remained in Persia as part of the garrison throughout the rest of the war. The 4th Battalion was part of the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade based in Malaya when the Japanese Army invaded in December 1941. The 4/19th Hyderabads were one of the few battalions in Malaya that were relatively well trained in jungle warfare. Although the battalion performed well in the fighting retreat in north-west Malaya, they were practically annihilated at the disastrous Battle of Slim River on 7 January 1942. The few survivors of the 4th Battalion were withdrawn to Singapore where they took part in the brief defence of the island before it surrendered on 15 February 1942.

He currently teaches creative writing and film at Williams College. His wife, Karen Shepard, is also a novelist. They are on the editorial board of the literary magazine The Common, based at Amherst College. Writing Shepard's work has been published in McSweeney's, Granta, The Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, Harper's, The New Yorker, The Paris Review, Ploughshares, Triquarterly, and Playboy. His short story collection — Like You'd Understand, Anyway — won the Story Prize in 2007, and was nominated for a National Book Award in 2007. The novel Project X won the 2005 Massachusetts Book Award. Along with writing novels and short stories, Shepard has also drafted two screenplays, one about Kenneth Donaldson and the O'Connor v. Donaldson case, and the other a movie adaptation of Project X. Several features characterize Shepard's writings, including a tendency to finish his stories with what Charles Baxter called an \\"in medias res ending\\", or an ending in the middle of the plot's events; a thematic focus on what Shepard calls the \\"costs of certain kinds of ethical passivity\\"; and a preference for events-driven plots that fight against what Shepard terms \\"the tyranny of the epiphany\\", referencing the more psychological, less active plots popularized by short story writers such as James Joyce. Additionally, Shepard writes from the point of view of characters of a wide variety of nationalities. Shepard's stories often rely on substantial historical research based on real events. His recent collection, Like You'd Understand Anyway, includes stories about the Greek playwright Aeschylus, the Chernobyl disaster and the 1964 Alaska earthquake. The collection acknowledges over sixty non- fiction works that helped to shape the historical detail in the stories. Similarly, Shepard's 2011 collection You Think That's Bad also cites an extensive bibliography, including Avalanches and Snow Safety, The Japanese Earthquake of 1923, Climate Changes and Dutch Water Management, and Satanism and Witchcraft.

In the late 1980s, there were a number of serious incidents in which many lives were lost, such as the sinking of the MV Jupiter (1961), Hillsborough, the Herald of Free Enterprise, Lockerbie, the Marchioness, Piper Alpha and UTA Flight 772. Maurice de Rohan from the Herald Families Association realised that the issues the Herald families were experiencing would almost certainly be encountered by others in similar disasters. He, along with like minded individuals, founded the charity. It won a Guardian charity of the year award in 2004 for excellence in its field. Development The organisation evolved and developed through the years with one significant development being the introduction of legislation to provide for remedies against Corporate manslaughter, which culminated with a new law coming into force on 1 April 2008. The charity also generated income through charging fees for presentations by members on training courses for corporate bodies based on members' experience. Funding and status The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust funded much of the organisation's work on corporate responsibility as well as offering core funding for five years from 2003. The Esmee Fairbairn Foundation and then the Golden Bottle/Bulldog trusts also gave grants for core funding.

The squadron is responsible for performance launch, on-orbit, emergency, end-of-life testing and disposal operations providing warning, navigation, R&D;, surveillance and weather to the president and the Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and nine combatant commanders worldwide. It was first activated in 1961 as the 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron as the SPACETRACK component of NORAD's Space Detection and Tracking System. It was the operational version of Project Space Track. It continued this mission as the 1st Aerospace Control Squadron until inactivation in 1976. Mission The squadron conducts command and control for four distinct constellations: Defense Support Program (DSP), Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) and a NASA research and development program, in low earth to deep space orbits, and is Air Force Space Command's only multi-mission Satellite Operations Control Center.PatriotFiles.com: 1st Space Operations Squadron Factsheet 1 SOPS is supported by the Air Force Reserves unit, the 7th Space Operations Squadron. The squadron operates and maintains 24-hour Air Force Satellite Control Network command and control capability for Defense Support Program and Midcourse Space Experiment constellations. It also operates and maintains a research and development space system providing vital space weather data worldwide. The 1st Squadron performs launch and early-orbit operations for GPS and DSP systems including satellite activation, initial checkout and transfer to mission orbit. It plans and executes tracking, telemetry and command functions for GPS, DSP, MXS and a NASA research and development satellite to maintain spacecraft state-of-health, sustain on-orbit operations and accomplish mission taskings. They respond to all satellite emergencies, and support end-of-life testing and disposal operations for GPS, DSP and MSX and NASA research and development spacecraft as required. The squadron maintains DSP spacecraft positional knowledge and distributes data to worldwide users. It also conducts MSX and NASA research and development training and evaluation. The Multi-Mission Space Operations Center (MMSOC) is a revolutionary approach to space operations—an operations center focused on forging a one-of-a-kind operations/acquisition team to demonstrate and field emerging space missions and satellite C2 technologies in a rapid, decisive manner. The MMSOC is structured to operate a variety of satellite missions, including satellite initiatives without a program office, satellite missions of small scale (small constellations), new missions transitioning from concept toward full-scale operations, and all research, development, test and evaluation satellites with operational utility remaining after test and evaluation are complete. Mission control crew shifts conduct 24-hour operations supporting the three major functions of satellite control; telemetry, tracking and commanding. Orbital analysts and program engineers provide program specific knowledge and support to the crews. The operators perform pre-contact planning, real time contact and post-contact evaluation. The squadron conducts more than 2,000 contacts a month.

In March 1961, the Laredo Air Force Base sensor was transferred from Air Research and Development Command to Air Defense Command. It was operated by Detachment 1 of the squadron.Air Defense Command.

Ent Air Force Base, CO, 1961] In January 1968, the System 440L over-the-horizon radar reached initial operational capability. In 1968, SPACETRACK was also supported by the Royal Radar Establishment at Great Malvern, England. By mid-1969, three USAF Baker-Nunn cameras were operated in support of SPACETRACK under the 18th Surveillance Squadron, despite questions about their on-going utility in view of increasing radar tracking accuracies.1969 Historical reports from the squadron and its detachments on file at the Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB AL, AFHRA Microfilm reels KO363 and KO364 An AN/FPS-85 phased array radar became operational at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in May 1970. Orbital computations The squadron initially made orbital predictions by computing ephemerides based on standard Kepler orbits. As a satellite got lower into the atmosphere, drag made it difficult to forecast the ephemeris of the satellite accurately.Cotter, Lawrence R.. Reminiscences About Space Track History. Privately published. Berkeley CA, 20 November 2006. By 1962, the situation was somewhat better. The Soviet satellite Sputnik 4 was slowly entering lower orbits because of atmospheric drag. Using a new program, (Satellite General Perturbations Differential Corrections) and observations from the radar at Shemya Air Force Station, the orbital analyst plotted the changing orbital period and was able to predict the exact revolution on which the satellite reentered the atmosphere.A 20-pound piece of it landed on a street in downtown Manitowoc, Wisconsin on the western shore of Lake Michigan. To make progress in automating ephemeris forecasts, Aeronutronic and TRW Inc. developed sophisticated new programs. Squadron orbital analysts evaluated the two programs. The Aeronutronic submission was named Spiral Decay and the TRW submission, Electronic Systems Precision Orbit Determination (ESPOD). ESPOD had been developed for Program 437, an anti-satellite program, to enable computation of trajectories for satellite intercept. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of Spiral Decay, the program was used to forecast the reentry of Soviet Kosmos 23. Public media had been alerted to the impending decay and many people in Canada saw the fiery reentry. One racetrack even dimmed the lights to enhance the show. Spiral Decay was considered a more sophisticated program than ESPOD and used less computer time to attain more accurate results. It was selected as the standard for analysis, significantly helping predict future decay trajectories. It was also adopted as the primary computer capability for weapon engagement and was useful in more precisely locating sensors, such at the radar at Dyarbakir Air Station, Turkey.Walters, Dr. Louis G.. Historical Perspective, Ford/Philco/Loral Aerospace Astrodynamics Role in Space Command Evolution. Zephyr Cove NV: 15 August 1993 in Mansfield, Roger L. et al.(q.v.) On 1 March 1965, the rocket body of Kosmos 61 exploded between revolutions 1 and 2, giving 1st Aero another challenge to catalog the many fragments. Because the orbital period was 106 minutes, the fragments would not decay quickly. Two computer programs, SPACESWEEP and ALTEC, aided automation of the task but, when Cosmos 200 broke up on 23 January 1968, the breakup created severe problems to the Space Defense Center because of the amount of manual work needed. Also in March 1965, the Special Projects Division was supporting evaluation of the upgraded Shemya radar and the associated computer, in a project nicknamed Blue Fox. Blue Fox used both Spiral Decay and ESPOD to determine the accuracy of the new Shemya system, tracking satellites Transit 2A and ANNA 1B, a Navy geodetic satellite. The Blue Fox results, showing radar range biases of 129 meters or less, proved that the Shemya AN/FPS-80M was now the most accurate tracking radar in the system.

Hanscom Field, Massachusetts was the backup facility for squadron operations. About 49 hours before the 1st Squadron became operational, the Navy's Transit 4A carrier rocket exploded. Orbital analysts at the 1st and at Hanscom achieved a landmark in satellite tracking by identifying 296 of the fragments. On 5 June 1962, the relationship with Hanscom was formalized when several squadron officers activates the Space Track Center Alternate Facility at Hanscom. From 25 March to 6 April 1962, squadron orbital computations were transferred to Project Space Track while the Ent computer was being modified. In mid-1962, the NORAD Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence expressed appreciation for the information and technical assistance the squadron provided in support of NORAD analysis of the Soviet Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 operations.Hull, Harris B.. Headquarters North American Air Defense Command. Letter of Appreciation to Commander, USAF Air Defense Command. Ent AFB CO: 29 August 1962 A new Soviet launch, which occurred on 1 November 1963. In plotting the observations made by the BMEWS radar at RAF Fylingdales, England, and other sensors the data showed an apparent change in the satellite's orbital period. The data indicated that the Soviets had boosted the satellite, changing its orbit. This confirmed a boast by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev that the Soviets had a maneuverable satellite, something that had been treated with some disbelief by the intelligence community.Donaldson, E.M.. \\"Russian Satellite Seen to Change Orbit,\\" Daily Telegraph. London: 28 November 1963 It is now known that the satellite, called Polyot, was in fact a prototype orbital carrier rocket for an anti satellite system. Only one other Polyot was launched (in April 1964); the system never became operational. In mid-1965, there was concern that two Soviet satellites had attempted a rendezvous in space. Aeronutronic technicians combined the existing Xroads and Groundtrack programs into a new program that could compare the relative positions of two satellites. This enabled the duty orbital analyst to prove that a rendezvous had not taken place.The program was later called COMBO, which was appropriate, but later gave it the formal name, Computation of Miss Between Orbits. COMBO, with some modifications, continues to be a major program in the Space Track arsenal at Vandenberg AFB, as it enables forecasts of possible collisions in space, a major concern for all satellite programs, manned and unmanned. In 1966, the Gemini IV astronauts saw what appeared to be a nearby space object. The COMBO program did not identify any nearby satellites. Shortly thereafter a short movie clip of the mystery object taken by the astronauts indicated it was probably something associated with the spacecraft, perhaps dangling from a tether.Schinnerer, Ralph. E-mail correspondence, 20 February 2011 Squadron operations were based on the techniques developed at Project Space Track. By 1962,Ferguson, Mary E., Task Specifications of the SPADATS Duty Orbital Analyst. Field Note FN=CN-101/000/00. System Development Corporation, Santa Monica CA, 17 September 1962 initial observations were processed by the Report Association Program which ran automatically twice a day plus twice for BMEWS data. The program associated observations with known orbits. The output of the program, plus data from the Checker Program, was sent to the duty space surveillance officer and technician for review with some assistance from the duty orbital analyst as needed. Other special duty orbital analyst activity occurred when a satellite neared decay. When the orbital period fell below 90 minutes, the duty space surveillance officer notified the duty orbital analyst and a special analyst was normally assigned to monitor the decay. In the unusual case of the decay of a Discoverer recovery vehicle that had not come down where programmed, the duty orbital analyst had access to a special computer program, which provided a sub-satellite trace for one revolution, to assist in specifying the track. New friendly launches were handled by a duty orbital analyst dedicated to the task but, in the case of new Soviet launches, an analyst for intelligence was assigned. Analysis of interplanetary and lunar probe launches were handled by Special Project Analysts, who had several special astrodynamic programs to assist in computations. The Encke program was used when the vehicle was within 125 earth radii and the Interplanetary program, adjusting for planetary perturbations, for vehicles beyond that distance. The Special Project Analysts also handled special requests for such things as very accurate orbital elements or decay information for a satellite (as might be required by research or educational groups). These analysts also monitored incoming technical papers, attended technical meetings to obtain information which was of use to the mission, and monitored improvements in decay forecasts. =Satellite control= On 5 October 1987, the squadron was reactivated, renamed the 1st Satellite Control Squadron, and began its ever- growing satellite control mission. On 16 February 1988, the squadron began its first commanding on the DSP constellation. The Space Operations Center (SOC) was operationally turned over to AFSPC on 21 December 1989. The SOC increased its mission on 20 February 1990, when the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program mission was operationally turned over. In May 1996, satellite command authority for the first research and development satellite controlled by AFSPC, Technology for Autonomous Operational Survivability, was given to 1st SOPS. On 4 December 1998, the squadron assumed command and control capability on the Midcourse Space Experiment, which became an operational program on 1 October 2000, with the first-ever transfer of operations from the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to AFSPC.

Afiouni enjoyed an incredible rapport with his students in middle school. After he moved to teach IB physics in the Secondary School, he developed a teaching mechanism that involves a projector that allows all class lectures to be recorded. This technique might be employed in some Bahrain universities, as he has given seminars that explain the mechanism of the technique. His latest project was KAG, a car that he developed and created from nothing but shaped piping which gave the car its unique look. The car uses some technologies replacing the rear-view mirror with a camera, automatic open and close doors, and liquid electronic display (LED) lighting all over the body and engine, which is open to view. His past research involves the development of conductive polymers coated on non-conductive substrates for use in multi- spectral screening material.

Biography  Becoming interested in pottery as a child by watching a nearby farmer who made pottery in his spare time, Kawai-san knew by the age of 16 that he wanted to become a potter. Kanjirō graduated from the Tokyo Higher Polytechnical School in 1914 and worked briefly at the Kyoto Research Institute for Ceramics. Hamada Shoji, whom he first met in Tokyo, followed Kawai to Kyoto, where the two are said to have conducted over 10,000 experiments on glazes. Disillusioned with what he felt was an unnecessarily excessive focus on studying theory at both schools, in 1920 he built his own kiln in Kyoto (a climbing kiln \\"noborigama\\") \\"the Shokeiyo, with eight chambers, began the \\"Kawai Factory\\" and began to give exhibitions. Kawai was trained in the use of chemical glazes and gained wide recognition for their use while still in his early twenties. But he was ultimately dissatisfied with this early work and, thanks in large part to a chance encounter with Yanagi Soetsu and Hamada Shoji, turned instead to natural glazes, to nature, or \\"to the science that precedes all science - and a return to nature was my salvation\\". He is widely regarded as a master of glazes, especially of warm red copper (shinsha or yuriko - one of his trademark colors), rich brown iron (tetsu-yu), chrome and cobalt (gosu). As a potter he sought to combine modern methods of manufacture with traditional Japanese and English designs. He was also an artist, calligrapher, sculptor, writer and philosopher. As a man who respected the dignity of simplicity and collected the works of poor craftspeople from all over Asia, he admired \\"ordered poverty\\" and had a profound love for the unpretentious men of the soil and made their simplicity a part of himself. His pots come in many asymmetrical shapes and show expressionistic techniques such as tsutsugaki (slip-trailed decoration), ronuki (wax-resist) or hakeme (white slip). Kanjirō refused all official honours, including the designation of Living National Treasure. Like his lifelong friend Hamada, Kawai never signed his work but said, \\"My work itself is my best signature.\\" His pieces are on display in the Folk Art Museum of Tokyo and each year, the Takashimaya Department Store had an exhibition of his work in their Tokyo and Osaka shops. In November 1953, Kawai-san had one of his biggest exhibitions at the Korin Kaku in Tokyo and over 500 of his pieces were shown.We Do Not Work Alone, Yoshiko Uchida, Kawai Kanjiro's House Press, 1953. Legacy Kanjirō's restored house interior, January 2008 Kawai taught Claude Laloux in the nineteen fifties and mentored a number of Japanese ceramic artists throughout his life. His house (restored in 1973) in Gojōzaka, Kyoto, is now a museum run by his relatives. Besides a display of his ceramics, some of his sculpture and woodcarvings are included in the collection. His house incorporates both Japanese and Western living styles, so one can see both tansu and tatami and also some Western furnishings. His studio and noborigama kiln are to the rear of the museum. The firing lasted 48 hours and consumed over 2,000 bundles of firewood. The interior temperature reached 1,350 Celsius. Quotes He was also a poet and, like his pottery, his writing is strong and unconventional. In 1953, a book entitled We Do Not Work Alone was published. \\"The pledge of fire: To return to all things purified.\\" \\"Everything that is, is not. Everything is, yet at the same time, nothing is.

He played quarterback for the University of Texas Longhorns during the 1981 and 1982 season. He is the last walk-on quarterback to start for Texas and the last to start in the Cotton Bowl. His most memorable moment was the late touchdown he scored against Alabama to guide Texas to a 1982 Cotton Bowl Classic win. He is also the younger member of the only father-son combination to start at quarterback for Texas. Both father and son led Longhorn teams to victory over Bear Bryant coached teams (Charley against Texas A&M; in 1954 and 1955 and Robert against Alabama in 1982).http://bleacherreport.com/articles/319276-1982-cotton-bowl- texas-vs-alabama-one-perfect-play High school Robert Brewer came from a football family. His father, Charles Brewer had been the starting quarterback at Texas from 1953–55 and his uncle George Brewer had played in the starting backfield with Darrell Royal at Oklahoma. A Richardson, Texas native, Brewer was barely recruited out of high school, and received no scholarship offers. College career Never recruited by the school he loved, Brewer drove to Austin and convinced Coach Fred Akers to give him a shot.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1125851/2/index.htm He made the Longhorns football team as a walk-on. Later he was awarded a scholarship and finally got his chance halfway through his junior season. In 1980, he backed up Donnie Little but played in only one game, against TCU. It was during the 1981 season that Brewer became the starter. Texas won its first four games and became the consensus #1 team in the country with Rick McIvor at quarterback. During that time, Brewer played only a handful of downs. But then they lost badly to unranked Arkansas, with McIvor throwing 4 interceptions, allowing Brewer a chance to play in that game. A few weeks later, with Texas losing to Houston 14-0, Brewer went in for an injured McIvorhttp://insidetexas.com/news/story.php?article=1874 and was able to rally the team to a 14-14 tie, completing 8 of 20 passes for 93 yards including the game-tying two-point conversion to tailback John Walker. Brewer became the team's starter and led them to three straight wins, a #6 ranking, a slim chance at the National Championship and a spot in the Cotton Bowl in place of conference champion Southern Methodist, who was on probation and ineligible that year. The 1981 Cotton Bowl was arguably Brewer's best game. Down 10-0 in the 4th quarter against #3 Alabama, Brewer got the Longhorns down to Alabama's 30 yard line and then, on a QB draw play called \\"one\\" that wasn't even in the playbook, ran 30 yards for a touchdown. It was his longest running play of his career. Texas got the ball back a few minutes later and Brewer led the Longhorns 80 yards down the field, hitting four straight passes of 37, 10, 19, and 10 yards before Terry Orr ran it in from the 8-yard line for the game- winning touchdown. Texas finished 10-1-1 with a final No. 3 National Ranking. In 1982, Brewer threw for 12 TDs and set UT records for attempts and yardage, and tied the mark for completions. Texas finished 9-2 that year and went to the Sun Bowl. But five days before that game, Brewer suffered a broken thumb in practice, ending his career one game early. His last game was an upset win at home against #6 Arkansas. He went 13-2 as a starter. =Records= * UT - Highest Average Gain per pass completion, game (min 5. completions) (32.6), surpassed by Todd Dodge in 1985 Later life After graduation, Brewer went to work in the private sector before returning to UT as Assistant Athletic Director for development for seven years. He was in charge of raising funds through the Longhorn Foundation. He then became a financial adviser for Merrill Lynch in Austin. He is married to Laura Moerschell, the sister of former Texas quarterback Rob Moerschell. One of Brewer's sons, Michael, graduated from high school as one of the top quarterback recruits in the United States for the 2011 Recruiting year. He went to Texas Tech, but after the 2013-14 season he announced his plans to transfer. He considered transferring to Texas, but was denied his transfer request by Texas Tech. He instead went to Virginia Tech, where he became the starting quarterback for the 2014 and 2015 seasons.http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on- college-football/24410020/michael-brewer-second-texas-tech-qb-to-announce- transfer Another son, Charlie, is also a quarterback.

He was the driving force behind a number of punk rock bands, first in Worcester, Massachusetts, but mostly in Providence, Rhode Island. In addition to lead vocals, Severens would perform on both bass and guitar, usually bass. As a visual artist, he worked in acrylic paint, ink, charcoal and mixed media. The aesthetic throughout was consistent: punk. Influenced by early punk rock bands the Clash and the Dead Boys, Severens began writing song with Richard \\"Foghorn\\" Harnois with whom he founded the Aggressions c. 1984. The Aggressions, along with the Commandos and the Performers, constituted the core of Worcester's early hardcore punk scene, playing frequently at Ralph's Diner. The Aggressions enjoyed local radio success with their song \\"Howard Johnson's\\" about an ill-fated attempt to drive through a snow storm to a punk rock concert. In Providence, Severens founded his most influential band, Boneyard, who opened for Goo Goo Dolls and Social Distortion. Members included Gail Greenwood who would later join Belly and L7. His other main Providence-based project was My Way. The Scarecrow The image of a scarecrow/crucifix appears throughout Severens' artwork, included as a tattoo on his right arm. This image served as a central theme for his views on the human condition: where Jesus gave the ultimate sacrifice to call down the doves of peace, modern religion has \\"made him a scarecrow, to chase the doves away\\", as Severens wrote in his song The Scarecrow. The Scarecrow expresses the image and its meaning more fully. On the Boneyard recordings, Severens delivers the vocal, bringing his biting sarcasm to the fore. An alternate arrangement recorded by Severens' brother and accomplished cellist Michael Severens, features a simple vocal with cello accompaniment that brings out the more enduring themes to which the song points. Eugene Padanyi Severens died in February 2006, in Worcester, Massachusetts, at the age of 42.

Originally published in English in 1996, it has since appeared in 25 languages and in 2006 a 10th anniversary edition was published in the United States. Description Through a series of short fictional stories and discussion following them, Baker proposes evolutionary functions for sexual habits, mostly on the principle of competition between sperm of different men for a prized egg. The \\"sperm wars\\" include both literal battles between sperm inside a woman's reproductive tract, as well as figurative battles between men competing for the chance to mate. The book is controversial, both because of its explanations of homosexuality, sexual assault, and prostitution, and because some critics have claimed that several of the hypotheses in the book are not supported by scientific research. Oral sex is explained as an opportunity for partners to judge each other's reproductive health, and for mates to detect recent infidelity (also proposed by Kohl & Francoeur, 1995 \\"The Scent of Eros\\"). The shape of the penis and the thrusting during intercourse serve to remove other men's semen.Gallup, G.G. & Burch, R.L. (2004) Semen Displacement as a Sperm Competition Strategy in Humans. Evolutionary Psychology, 2, 12–23. Male masturbation is said to discard old, dying sperm, so that an ejaculate contains younger sperm that will stay active inside the cervix longer, with more of a chance of being present during the window of ovulation. Baker also proposes that men adjust the amount of sperm they ejaculate based on the time their mate has spent away from them.Baker, R.R. & Bellis, M.A. (1989). Number of sperm in human ejaculates varies in accordance with sperm competition theory. Anim. Behav., 37, 867–869. Likewise, women are found to be more likely to engage in extra-pair copulation and retain larger amounts of sperm during their most fertile phase of the month, and more likely to have sex with their regular partner during the infertile phase.Bellis, M.A. & Baker, R.R. (1990). Do females promote sperm competition?: Data for humans. Anim. Behav., 40, 997–999. Focus A major focus of the book is sperm heteromorphism, in which not only are a variety of morphological typesBelsey, M.A. et al. (1987) WHO Laboratory Manual for Examination of Human Semen and Semen-Cervical Mucus Interaction. 2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge of sperm apparent in every normal human ejaculate, but also at any one time fewer than 1% seem capable of responding to and fertilizing an egg.Quinn, P. & Marrs, R.P. (1991) Effect of concentration and total number of spermatozoa on fertilizationof human oocytes in vitro. Hum. Reproduc. 6, Suppl. 1, Abst 238 A similarly low proportion of fertile sperm is found in the ejaculates of mice.Siddiquey, A.K.S. & Cohen, J. (1982) In vitro fertilization in the mouse and the relevance of different sperm-egg concentrations and volumes. J. Reprod. Fertil. 66, 237–42 Baker calls these fertile sperm \\"egg-getters\\", and claims that the rest of the sperm in the ejaculate are infertile \\"kamikaze sperm\\" or \\"blockers\\", whose primary purpose is to prevent other men's sperm from getting to the egg.Baker, R.R. & Bellis, M.A. (1988). ‘Kamikaze’ Sperm in Mammals? Anim. Behav., 36, 936–939. He cites data suggesting that in Britain at least 4% of children (but perhaps as many as 6–12%) are conceived via sperm competition,Baker, R.R. & Bellis, M.A. (1995) Human Sperm Competition: copulation, masturbation and infidelity. Chapman & Hall, London. pp.201–2 and claims that this lower figure is consistent with the earlier finding that 10% of children have a biological father who is other than their supposed father.Macintyre, S. & Sooman, A. (1992) Non-paternity and prenatal genetic screening. Lancet, 338, 839. Baker describes in detail how \\"killer sperm\\" actively seek out rival sperm and kill them with poison from acrosomes to prevent them from getting to the egg. This literal sperm warfare was not observed in a subsequent experiment, but Baker criticizes the protocol in this latter experiment. Studies Based on studies with a fiber optic endoscope attached to a man's penis during sex, Baker describes how the cervix behaves during sex and orgasm, dipping down \\"like an elephant's trunk\\" into the pool of semen so that the sperm can more easily swim into it, the so-called \\"upsuck theory\\" of female orgasm. This has also come under some criticism; see Cervix#Function. He theorizes about how the timing of orgasm can affect fertility, due to changes in the cervical mucus said to accompany orgasm, which then affect its ability to \\"filter out\\" sperm and prevent them from traveling into the cervix. Other studies have found no connection to sperm transport or fertility.Bancroft, 1989Masters & Johnson, 1966 Although Baker draws a clear distinction between \\"predatory rape\\" and \\"date rape\\", the book has drawn criticism for portraying \\"date rape\\" and \\"rough-and-tumble intercourse\\" as being on the same spectrum of behaviour: a test of the male's strength and ability. Despite Baker asserting that the two behaviours are at different (illegal and legal) ends of that spectrum, his statement that the drawing of the line between criminal and non-criminal behaviour is a job for the legal profession and not for the biologist has led some to interpret his words as meaning that he sees no real difference between the two:Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex. - book reviews \\"Baker makes few distinctions between these two types of aggression and attributes both to female testing of male partners' strength and ability to overcome her resistance\\" In this context he makes comparison with the many examples of aggressively induced ovulation in mammals, including the extreme example of mink in which if the female does not experience physical trauma at the male's hands, she does not ovulateFord, C.S. and Beach, F.A. (1952) Patterns of Sexual Behavior. Eyre and Spottiswoode, LondonVan Tienhoven, A. (1968) Reproductive Physiology of Vertebrates. W.B. Saunders, London. Orientation Regarding sexual orientation, he states that true homosexuals are rare; that only 6% of the male population engages in any sort of homosexual behavior in their lifetime, and that 80% of those also have sex with women, so he focuses on bisexuality. \\"It seems most likely that exclusive homosexuality is a genetic by-product of the reproductively advantageous characteristic of bisexuality. If so, homosexual behaviour joins the ranks of a number of other human characteristics that are advantageous when a person has inherited a few of the relevant genes, but disadvantageous if they have inherited more.\\" Bisexuality in both men and women is explained as an adaptive trait because it provides earlier opportunities to gain sexual experience, and more opportunities to practice skills such as infidelity and interacting with people of different personalities. Experience gained with a member of the same sex of a particular character type can help the bisexual to get the most out of a relationship with a member of the opposite sex of a similar character type. Although studies show that by the age of 40 years bisexuals have fewer children than heterosexuals,Essock-Vitale, S.M. & McGuire, M.T. (1985) Women's lives viewed from an evolutionary perspective: I. Sexual Histories, reproductive success, and demographic characteristics of a random sample of American women. Ethol. Sociobiol., 6, 137–54Baker, R.R. & Bellis, M.A. (1995) Human Sperm Competition: copulation, masturbation and infidelity. Chapman & Hall, London. pp.117 he maintains that at low levels in the population bisexuality is still an evolutionary advantage since the children are typically conceived earlier in life; by age 20 years bisexuals have four times the reproductive success of heterosexuals, and by age 25 twice the success.Baker, R.R. & Bellis, M.A. (1995) Human Sperm Competition: copulation, masturbation and infidelity. Chapman & Hall, London. pp.117–8 Homophobia is then explained as a natural response to the threat of this reproductive advantage (despite the fact that true homosexuals are not in competition for females), as well as \\"the bisexual's role in the spread of disease\\".

Career  Stabile's vocal studies took place at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome with Antonio Cotogni, and he made his professional debut in Palermo, as Marcello in La bohème, in 1909. After singing throughout Italy, he appeared in Saint Petersburg in 1911, Buenos Aires in 1913, Barcelona in 1914, and made his debut at the Paris Opera in 1917, as Amonasro in Aida. The turning point of his career came when Arturo Toscanini chose him for the title-role in Falstaff for the reopening of La Scala in 1921, a role that he would eventually sing an estimated 1200 times during his long career. He sang at La Scala until 1955, and among his other roles there were: Gérard, Scarpia, Iago, Malatesta, Dulcamara, Beckmesser, Schicchi. Also at La Scala, he created the title role of Respighi's Belfagor, in 1923. He also took part in the revival of Il turco in Italia, as Prosdocimo, in 1955, opposite Maria Callas. Stabile appeared regularly at the Royal Opera House in London, from 1926 to 1931.

His only appearance in North America seems to have been in Chicago in 1924. Stabile had a good voice, if not particularly beautiful, and it was used with style and intelligence. He had excellent diction and was an outstanding singing-actor, especially in comedy, and he enjoyed a remarkably long career.

Plot introduction This book in the series covers approximately 35 days, starting on the second day of the second month (Heron) and ending on the seventh day of the third month (Partridge). For the most part it follows the adventures of two men (Garric and Cashel) and four women (Liane, Ilna, Tenoctris, and Sharina) as they are split up into parallel worlds and slowly reunite, culminating in the defeat of two of their enemies: the Queen and the Beast. Plot summary In the introduction, the current King of the Isles, Valence III, and his wizard, Silyon, make a deal with the Beast to regain control of his kingdom from his wife, the Queen. Meanwhile, the main characters are in Erdin where they discover the dead remains of a Scaled Man on their ship, which Tenoctris sees as a bad omen. With the exception of Ilna, they book passage on the ship Lady of Mercy, bound for the Isle of Valles, where Garric intends to declare himself King of the Isles. Before they leave, Ilna gives Liane a sash that she has woven which will notify her if Liane is ever in trouble. Before the ship reaches Valles, a lens appears in the sky and swallows the ship, causing it to wreck. Garric, Liane, and Tenoctris awake, following the shipwreck, in the land of the Ersa. They eventually make it back to their own world. There they are picked up by a hunting party, led by the noble, Lord Royhas. Rather than dispose of Garric, as he was ordered to, Royhas takes Garric back into the city and holds a council with several other powerful nobles. They express their loyalty to the King but ask Garric's help in overthrowing the Queen. Tenoctris uses a mirror to spy on the Queen and discovers that she is a demon. Garric plans an attack on the mansion. When they've passed all the Queen's safeguards, Garric uses iron to destroy the Queen's gate to another world, but she has already escaped. Following this, Garric appoints himself Prince Regent under King Valence III and demands the allegiance of the Lords who backed him in the revolt. Meanwhile, Admiral Nitker, of the Royal Navy, has declared himself the new Lord of the Isles. Garric promises to destroy Admiral Nitkers and the rebellious navy if they don't return to the King's service. Garric goes before King Valence III and receives his blessing as Prince Regent. Tenoctris discovers that the Queen's mansion was a nexus of portals to many different worlds, one of which led to the Beast. Cashel uses his quarterstaff to escape the lens that swallowed the ship and saves Sharina as well. They are rescued by Folquin, King of the nearest Isle, and his two wizards, Halphemos and Cerix. Folquin then seeks to marry Sharina. When Halphemos' talking ape, Zahag, throws a fit during a chess game with Liane, Cashel attempts to settle him down. Halphemos, casts a spell to immobilize the ape but the wizardess Silya secretly interferes and sends them to another world. Folquin immediately has Halphemos arrested. Cashel awakes after the transportation on a parallel island of Pandah. He and Zahag meet the lady Sosia who asks Cashel to save her daughter, Aria, who is imprisoned by a wizard Ilmed and the Scaled Men who serve him. Cashel and Zahag succeed in rescuing the princess Aria, but she is less than thrilled. They flee through several magical portals, eventually ending up back on the Isle of Pandah. After they defeat the wizardess Silya, Princess Aria (who has decided to marry Folquin) arranges a boat to help Cashel find Sharina. They arrive in Valles where they run into Ilna, Cerix, and Halphemos and then make their way to the palace where they find Garric, Liane, and Tenoctris. Sharina and Cerix break Halphemos out of prison and then they go in search of Ilna for help in recovering Cashel. But a wizard with the appearance and voice of Nonnus, Sharina's one-time protector, shows up and tricks her into leaving with him on another ship. Cerix and Halphemos to continue on their way to find Ilna. Sharina eventually discovers the treachery and jumps ship. She is rescued by a large man, named Hanno, who takes her to his home on the Isle of Bight. A phantasm and a group of Hairy Men sent by the Queen attack Hanno and Sharina, but they defeat them. They later discover that the Hairy Men have destroyed Hanno's boat. While searching for a way off the island, the false Nonnus and his crew discover Sharina. The spirit of the true Nonnus comes to her, possesses her body temporarily, and destroys her pursuers. She and Hanno make their way to the volcano at the center of the island and climb to the top. From there they can see that the Hairy Men, led by phantasms, are building boats so they can attack Ornifal. One of the phantasms captures Sharina and conveys her to the Queen. The Queen shows Sharina images of her friends (and an image of the Hairy Men on their way to Valles) and implies that she controls their fates through a chess board. The Queen tells Sharina that she intends to use her to find the Throne of Malkar. Sharina watches as the fleet of Hairy Men reaches the Royal Navy and destroys it, but Admiral Nitkers escapes. When the Queen threatens to send a giant ammonite against Cashel, Sharina agrees to help her. Ilna begins setting up shop in Erdin, but this time with the intent to good rather than evil. Using her craft she begins improving the conditions of the city. But Cerix and Halphemos eventually find her and seek her help in recovering her brother Cashel. Cerix realizes that many of Ilna's patterns contain writings in the Old Script—even though she can't read or write. She agrees to go with them. Before they can leave Erdin, though, they are captured by a band of Scaled Men. They load Ilna onto a ship and travel through a portal. Cerix and Halphemos find her sash, which she dropped during her tussle with the Scaled Men. It reveals a spell that takes them into a desert world. When Ilna's captors are attacked by Flyers, Ilna leaps through a portal opened by Cerix and Halphemos. Just as they seem to be succumbing to the desert, The People of Beauty arrive and rescue them. Ilna convinces the People of Beauty transport them to the city of Divers on Third Atara. They seek out the Baron Robilard. In his palace, Halphemos gets into trouble and Baron Robilard has him arrested. Ilna goes to Robilard to seek Halphemos’ release. Robilard makes demands, which Ilna fulfills, though to unfavorable results. A humbled Robilard frees Halphemos and offers to personally escort them to Valles. When they get there, Ilna is relieved when she finally finds Cashel. They make their way to the castle where they find Garric, Liane, and Tenoctris. When all except Sharina have been reunited, they set out to find the lair of the Beast. Admiral Nitkers arrives in Valles to warn them of the oncoming invasion of Hairy Men. Garric immediately orders preparations for battle. The Queen forces Sharina to participate in a spell which is meant to reveal the Throne of Malkar. Instead they learn that it is Garric, not Sharina, that the Queen needs. In the castle, the wizard Silyon and Admiral Nitker kidnap Liane and turn her over to the Beast, fifty meters down a well. At this point Ilna tears her sash and it reveals how to rescue Liane, by giving the key words (in the Old Script) needed to enter its lair. Garric enters the well and Ilna, Cerix, and Halphemos follow him down. The Beast attacks them, revealing that the Yellow King had imprisoned it there long ago and that it had lured them there to release it from its prison. It devours Halphemos and a grieving Cerix finishes the incantation so that the Beast can't escape. Instead it dissolves into fiery lava, unable to die because of its immortality, endlessly burning. Meanwhile, Tenoctris opens up the Queen's escape portal and Cashel and Zahag travel through it to where she is holding Sharina captive. He uses his staff to destroy the Queen and rescue Sharina. They meet back up with Tenoctris. A little later, Ilna, Cerix, Garric, and Liane arrive, escaping from the Beast's lair. Tenoctris and Cashel confiscate the Queen's chessboard. Tenoctris notes that the Queen herself was a pawn on the board, just like those she tried to manipulate. She and Cashel also notice the appearance of a new piece on the board—representing an island-sized black ammonite that an unknown wizard has just called up from the depths of the ocean.

Dietenberger GmbH und Ostalbverlag – Schwäbischer Heimatverlag Dietenberger & Theiss oHG, Schwäbisch Gmünd und Aalen, 1983, P. 148 - 24 December 1982, near Stuttgart) was a German geodesist and is well known as one of the most important scientists in geodetic astronomy and in electronic navigation. In the 1950s Ramsayer became professor at the Geodetic Institute of the University of Stuttgart. In the following years he founded the Institut für Navigation which he developed to a leading research institute in the fields of avionics. Many patents in automatic positioning methods and air guidance systems have their origin in Stuttgart research projects.  Work on navigation and geodesy  Much of Ramsayer's research on navigation concerned dead reckoning, automatic navigation maps based on Doppler radar, and improvements in astro navigation. Long series of NATO test flights showed the advantages of combining different positioning methods (integrated navigation). He is the author of some hundred special articles in scientific journals and author or coauthor of some dozen research reports. In geodesy and geosciences, Ramsayer's priority was the integration of electronic and astronomic observation methods to improve the mutual quality and the strength of networks. Another focus was analyses of the interdependence of accuracy and systematic errors. One of his major works late in life was volume IIa of the Handbuch der Vermessungskunde, published in 1968. Ramsayer retired from the geodetic institute in May 1980 and from flight navigation in 1981. His successors were Erik Grafarend in the area of geodesy and Philipp Hartl in the area of navigation. Ramsayer was honoured by several academic prizes and made an honorary doctor; in 1982 he got the most important prize in Austrian geodesy, the Friedrich Hopfner medal. He died near Stuttgart.

It is a subsidiary summit of Moel Hebog and a sister peak to the lower Moel Lefn. There is an asbestos trial mine located on the summit. A small seam of white asbestos was discovered however insufficient amounts to commercially mine.  Geology  The summit of Moel yr Ogof is composed of a brecciated rhyolite, diagnostic of gravitational collapse in a rhyolite dome. Surrounding the crown of the mount is a geological unit consisting of alternating bands, of varying thickness, of pillow basalts and a green/grey sandstone that is of mafic origin, potentially derived from the pillow basalt itself. The pillow basalt is relatively well preserved in places, where devitrification rims clearly outline the individual pillows. It is composed of dark green/black, very fine crystalline, basaltic rock, which has weathered to a dark red/brown colouration due to the presence of iron minerals. The sandstone member of the unit is a pale green/grey, fine to medium grained, well sorted sandstone. It shows good cross-bedding and rare ripple structures indicating a tidal depositonal environment. There is a large scale syncline running NNE-SSW, that extends straight through the summit of Moel yr Ogof and can be seen clearly, in the mountain's profile, when taking the path up to the Hebog ridge from the South. Owain Glyndŵr's cave can be found on the cliff at the eastern flank of the mountain. The Beddgelert Forest lies directly to the north east, while Cwm Pennant lies to the west.

From SR 17, the highway travels east to cross two pairs of railroad tracks owned by Columbia Basin Railroad, which go south to Connell and north to Moses Lake, to enter Warden. Once the roadway enters Warden, it is named 1st Street and later ends at Main Street. The busiest segment of the road in terms of vehicle counts was between SR 17 and Warden, with a daily average of 2,800 motorists in 2007; the busiest segment in 1970 was at Main Street, with a daily average of 2,100 motorists.

These emotions may be of the everyday variety (such as fear, wonder or sympathy) or may be specific to aesthetic contexts. Examples of the latter include the sublime, the beautiful, and the kitsch. In each of these respects, the emotion usually constitutes only a part of the overall aesthetic experience, but may play a more or less definitive function for that state. Types =Visual arts and film= The relation between aesthetic emotions and other emotions is traditionally said to rely on the disinterestedness of the aesthetic experience (see Kant especially). Aesthetic emotions do not motivate practical behaviours in the way that other emotions do (such as fear motivating avoidance behaviours). The capacity of artworks to arouse emotions such as fear is a subject of philosophical and psychological research.Aesthetic emotions Swiss Center for Affective Sciences It raises problems such as the paradox of fiction in which one responds with sometimes quite intense emotions to art, even whilst knowing that the scenario presented is fictional (see for instance the work of Kendall Walton). Another issue is the problem of imaginative resistance, which considers why we are able to imagine many far-fetched fictional truths but experience comparative difficulty imagining that different moral standards hold in a fictional world. This problem was first raised by David Hume, and was revived in current discussion by Richard Moran, Kendall Walton and Tamar Gendler (who introduced the term in its current usage in a 2000 article by the same name).Tamar Szabó Gendler (2000). The Puzzle of Imaginative Resistance. Journal of Philosophy 97 (2):55-81 Some forms of artwork seem to be dedicated to the arousal of particular emotions. For instance horror films seek to arouse feelings of fear or disgust; comedies seek to arouse amusement or happiness, tragedies seek to arouse sympathy or sadness, and melodramas try to arouse pity and empathy. =Music= In the philosophy of music, scholars have argued whether instrumental music such as symphonies are simply abstract arrangements and patterns of musical pitches (\\"absolute music\\"), or whether instrumental music depicts emotional tableaux and moods (\\"program music\\"). Despite the assertions of philosophers advocating the \\"absolute music\\" argument, the typical symphony-goer does interpret the notes and chords of the orchestra emotionally; the opening of a Romantic-era symphony, in which minor chords thunder over low bass notes is often interpreted by layman listeners as an expression of sadness in music. Also called \\"abstract music\\", absolute music is music that is not explicitly \\"about\\" anything, non-representational or non- objective. Absolute music has no references to stories or images or any other kind of extramusical idea. The aesthetic ideas underlying the absolute music debate relate to Kant's aesthetic disinterestedness from his Critique of Aesthetic Judgment, and has led to numerous arguments, including a war of words between Brahms and Wagner. In the 19th century, a group of early Romantics including Johann Wolfgang Goethe and E.T.A. Hoffmann gave rise to the idea of what can be labeled as spiritual absolutism. \\"Formalism\\" is the concept of ‘music for music’s sake’ and refers only to instrumental music without words. The 19th century music critic Eduard Hanslick argued that music could be enjoyed as pure sound and form, that it needed no connotation of extra-musical elements to warrant its existence.

To center was founded by the former Florida Governor and U.S. Senator Bob Graham to further the idea that citizens need a firm grounding in democratic government to discharge their rights and responsibilities. Graham visits the center frequently, introducing and interviewing speakers for the public programming and meeting with and hosting seminars for center students. The center, located in Pugh Hall on the University of Florida campus, held its grand opening in March 2008.About the center Public Programs The Bob Graham Center's mission includes encouraging discussion and analysis of current issues that affect citizens locally, nationally and globally. The Center regularly hosts public events, featuring to date: seven former state governors, four sitting or former United States senators, four sitting or former United States congressmen, three former national party chairmen, one former Secretary of State, one former supreme court justice and four former ambassadors, as well as numerous journalists, scholars and activists. These events are free and open to the public and most feature audience question-and-answer sessions. Most events are streamed live and archived on the Center’s website. Academic Programs The Bob Graham Center provides University of Florida students with the opportunity to combine academic coursework and credentials with a living curriculum of internships and real-world case studies.About the internship program The Center offers a Public Leadership Minor, an interdisciplinary program for undergraduates interested in careers in the public and private sectors. The Minor is designed to complement a variety of majors, including those in the natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, journalism and business. Students pursuing the Minor participate in workshops, seminars and the Center’s public programming, and an internship is required. Students have numerous opportunities to get involved in public service projects, such as serving on the Public Service Council or participating in the Civic Polling or Civic Library projects. Civic Engagement Programs The Knight Foundation Grant In December 2010, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded a three-year, three-million dollar grant to the Bob Graham Center to support its pioneering approach to prepare University of Florida (UF) students to be informed, skilled and engaged citizens. There are five distinct categories of activities (products) in the three-year Knight Grant. They are: * Knight Effective Citizenship Fellows - the intent is to assemble a group of visiting scholars to collaborate with scholars at UF and other universities, as well as experts and advocates for participatory citizenship from other sectors; * Develop an interactive online citizenship course to be tested at UF and brought to national audiences; * Build and implement an electronic “Civil Debate Wall” to provide a forum for students and citizens in Gainesville to engage in civil and public discussion on current issues; * Utilize and study new social media tools to understand how these technologies can develop informed, skilled, and engaged citizens; and * Evaluate experiential programs and study civic participation behavior of students and alumni The Bob Graham Center Civic Library The Civic Library highlights grass-root efforts by citizens and organizations advocating on behalf of policy or political change at any level of government. The case studies developed for the Civic Library draw upon journalistic and academic accounts and interviews with key participants. They describe the actual experiences of individual citizens or groups who have sought to influence the actions and decisions of governments in Florida and elsewhere. Issues on the local, state, national and international stage are examined by graduate students and professors from all disciplines. Bob Graham Center case studies are available for use by teachers at the secondary and higher education levels and individuals or organizations who are interested in the topics discussed in the cases. The Florida Joint Center for Citizenship The Florida Joint Center for Citizenship is a partnership between the Lou Frey Institute of Politics and Government at the University of Central Florida and the Bob Graham Center. Established in 2007 by formal agreement between the University of Florida and the University of Central Florida, the Joint Center develops initiatives intended to strengthen civics education and improve the condition of Florida's civic health. The Civil Debate Wall The Bob Graham Center’s Civil Debate Wall—popularly known as \\"The Wall\\"—is a series of interconnected touch-screen devices that allow students, teachers and citizens to share ideas and solutions to some of the most pressing political questions facing the nation.

It is assigned to the 307th Operations Group of Air Force Reserve Command, stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. The squadron is equipped with the Boeing B-52H Stratofortress, and is the Air Force's B-52 Formal Training Unit (F.T.U.). It is one of two reserve bomber squadrons in the United States Air Force. The 93rd is one of the oldest and most decorated units in the United States Air Force. History =World War I= Established as the 93d Aero Squadron in the Air Service during the summer of 1917 in Texas during World War I. Its first predecessor was organized as the 93rd Aero Squadron on 21 August 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas. The squadron deployed to France in October 1917 and trained for aerial combat with the French Air Force. The 93d fought on the Western Front during World War I as a pursuit squadron from 11 August until 10 November 1918. The unit was demobilized after the war in March 1919. The squadron's second predecessor was constituted as the 93rd Attack Squadron in 1929 as part of the United States Army Air Corps.Gorrell The squadron was reactivated in 1939 as part of the General Headquarters Air Force as the 93d Bombardment Squadron and assigned to the 19th Bombardment Group at March Field, California. Initially equipped with Martin B-10s, later Douglas B-18 Bolos, receiving early model Boeing B-17C Flying Fortresses before the end of the year. =B-17 Service in the Philippines and Australia= Hamilton Field, California until the end of the war. It was scrapped sometime after July 1946. The squadron deployed to the Philippines as the 93rd Bombardment Squadron in 1941, engaging in combat during the 1941–42 Battle of the Philippines at the beginning of World War II. Withdrawn to Australia, it fought in the Dutch East Indies campaign before returning to the United States and being re-equipped with Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers. It returned to the Pacific Theater of Operations in early 1945 to carry out strategic bombing missions over the Japanese Home Islands. The 93rd deployed with part of the 19th Group to the Philippines Air Force at Clark Field, Philippines in October 1941 as a reinforcement unit for the Far East Air Force when tensions were escalating between the United States and the Japanese Empire. On 6 December the 93d was sent to Del Monte Field, a new field established on Mindanao as a dispersal measure. On 8 December 1941 nearly half of the 19th Group's bombers were destroyed on the ground during an air raid at Clark. The survivors at Del Monte engaged in combat from secondary airfields against the invading Japanese forces until the situation in the Philippines became untenable and they were withdrawn to Australia. The survivors of the ground echelon fought as infantry during Battle of Bataan and after their surrender, were subjected to the Bataan Death March, although some did escape to Australia and some presumably fought on as unorganized guerrilla forces during the Japanese occupation. In Australia, the escaped airmen and aircraft of the squadron reformed into a combat unit; engaging in combat during the Dutch East Indies and New Guinea Campaigns flying heavy bomber combat missions from Australia. In late 1942, the B-17C/D and a few F models in Australia were replaced by long-range Consolidated B-24 Liberators, and the unit was returned to the United States and became an operational training unit with Second Air Force for replacement B-17 personnel. Harl Pease Medal of Honor On 7 August 1942, Captain Harl Pease led an all-volunteer crew from the 93d in a B-17 with a makeshift, hand-pumped fuel system on a mission over Rabaul, New Britain. While the crew was successful in bombing their target, Pease and his crew were shot down, captured and beheaded by Japanese forces. Pease posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his bravery, and Pease Air Force Base (now Pease Air National Guard Base) in his hometown of Portsmouth, New Hampshire was named in his honor in 1957. =B-29 Superfortress operations against Japan= It was redesignated on 1 April 1944 as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment squadron. When training was completed moved to North Field (Guam) in the Mariana Islands of the Central Pacific Area in January 1945 and assigned to XXI Bomber Command, Twentieth Air Force. Its mission was the strategic bombardment of the Japanese Home Islands and the destruction of its war-making capability. Its groups flew \\"shakedown\\" missions against Japanese targets on Moen Island, Truk, and other points in the Caroline Islands and Marianas. The squadron began combat missions over Japan on 25 February 1945 with a firebombing mission over Northeast Tokyo. The squadron continued to participate in wide area firebombing attack, but the first ten-day blitz resulting in the Army Air Forces running out of incendiary bombs. Until then the squadron flew conventional strategic bombing missions using high explosive bombs. The squadron continued attacking urban areas until the end of the war in August 1945, its subordinate units conducted raids against strategic objectives, bombing aircraft factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, and other targets in Japan. The squadron flew its last combat missions on 14 August when hostilities ended. Afterwards, its B-29s carried relief supplies to Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan and Manchuria. it remained on Guam after the war conducted sea-search, photographic mapping, and training missions in the western Pacific. =Korean War= Deployed to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa in June 1950 as a result of the Korean War. Flew strategic bombing missions over North Korea; targets included an oil refinery and port facilities at Wonsan, a railroad bridge at Pyongyang, and Yonpo Airfield. After United Nations ground forces pushed the communists out of South Korea, the squadron turned to strategic objectives in North Korea, including industrial and hydroelectric facilities. It also continued to attack bridges, marshalling yards, supply centers, artillery and troop positions, barracks, port facilities, and airfields. During the Cold War it carried out B-29 bombardment missions over North Korea during the Korean War, later being a Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress squadron as part of Strategic Air Command. Continued bombardment operations until the June 1953 armistice in Korea; returned to the United States in May 1954; the squadrons B-29s being sent to reclamation. =Strategic Air Command= Re-equipped with Boeing B-47 Stratojets in 1954 as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC). Flew strategic bombardment training missions until 1962 when B-47s were being phased out of the inventory. In 1960 was reassigned to SAC 4239th Strategic Wing, being re-equipped with Boeing B-52H Stratofortress intercontinental heavy bombers. The squadron moved to Kinchloe Air Force Base, Michigan to disperse its heavy bomber force. Conducted worldwide strategic bombardment training missions and providing nuclear deterrent. Was inactivated in 1963 when SAC inactivated its provisional Strategic Wings, redesignating them permanent Air Force Wings. Squadron was inactivated with aircraft, personnel and equipment being transferred to the 716th Bombardment Squadron, which was simultaneously activated. =Air Force reserve= B-52H being refueled from a KC-135 Stratotanker tanker Reactivated in the Air Force Reserve in 1993, conducting bombardment training. It won the B-52 category of the 1995 Gunsmoke competition and participated in training exercises through the 1990s. In September 2001 deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom where it flew 88 combat missions before redeploying to Barksdale Air Force Base in January 2002. It deployed in support of operations in Afghanistan again from May–September 2002. In March 2003 the 93d deployed to RAF Fairford and Diego Garcia in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Between March and August 2003 the 93d flew more than 100 combat sorties and dropped over 1 million pounds of munitions. From January–March 2005 the squadron deployed to Anderson Air Force Base, Guam as part of an ongoing bomber rotation to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to the Asian-Pacific region by the U.S. Pacific Command. On 3 March 2017, Lt. Col. Steven R. Smith became the first WSO to reach 10,000 hours on the B-52. As an flight instructor with the 93rd Bomb Squadron, Lt. Col.Smith had 496 combat hours and over 30 Years on B-52. =B-52 Formal Training Unit= In March 2009 the unit assigned the responsibility of being Air Force's Formal Training Unit and will train and prepare Air Combat Command and AFRC B-52 aircrews for worldwide missions. The squadron's aircraft complement grew from eight to 16, with the new assets transferring over from Barksdale's active duty 2nd Bomb Wing. The 2nd BW's 11th BS, the current B-52 FTU, became an active associate to the 93rd BS. The squadron will provide aircraft and produce sorties for the 340th Weapons School and the 49th Test and Evaluation Squadron, a B-52 test organization, at Barksdale AFB. Although the 93rd BS will no longer be an operational squadron once the FTU stands up, a small classic association comprised four crews will maintain combat proficiency with the 2nd BW.

The film was a satire of popular culture at the time, its targets ranging from progressive education to beach party films. It is based on Al Hine's 1961 novel of the same name. Plot From his prison cell, Alan Musgrave dictates his experiences of the previous year, which he dedicated to fulfilling the unending wishes and ambitions of high school senior Barbara Ann Greene. The daughter of Marie, a cocktail waitress sinking unhappily into her forties, Barbara Ann wants every kind of success and for everyone to love her. Signing a pact with Alan in wet cement, Barbara Ann soon has the 12 cashmere sweaters needed to join an exclusive girls' club. She drops out of school to become the principal's new secretary and gets involved in church activities run by strait-laced but hyper-hormonal Bob Bernard. When Barbara Ann decides she wants Bob for her husband, Alan facilitates this by keeping Bob's eccentric mother Stella, who disapproves of Barbara Ann, perpetually drunk. Then Barbara meets producer T. Harrison Belmont, the King of Beach Party movies, and decides to become the biggest star that ever was. Bob refuses, however, to allow his wife to have a Hollywood screen test, so Barbara Ann decides she wants a divorce. Since Bob's mother frowns upon divorce, Alan takes matters into his own hands to kill Bob. Although Bob proves to be almost indestructible, by graduation time Alan has him in a wheelchair. At the graduation ceremony, Alan pursues Bob with a tractor, apparently killing him and several people on the speakers' platform. Barbara Ann goes on to Hollywood fame in her debut film Bikini Widow, while Alan is sent to prison.

The New York Times called the book \\"hilarious at times and often charmingly wicked.\\" Film rights were bought in December 1964 by Gordon Carroll and George Axelrod under the banner of their company, Charleston Enterprises. Axelrod called the book \\"a cross between Andy Hardy and Dr Strangelove.\\" Larry Johnson wrote the script along with Axelrod. In May 1965 Roddy McDowell signed to play the lead. United Artists agreed to finance and Axelrod decided to direct. Axelrod had directed three plays on Broadway, Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, Once More With Feeling and Goodbye Charlie but this was his first film. Axelrod said he asked George S. Kaufman how to direct and Kaufman said \\"you get good actors. He was right. And if it's a comedy you don't get Actors Studio actors\\". \\"I'm not really sure why I'm making this picture,\\" said Axelrod. \\"Maybe I'm just trying to get revenge on my own teenagers. Lord Love a Duck will not be made specifically for the teenage market but teenagers will probably dig it. It puts everything down - society, vulgarity, adolescents. Teenagers like being put down.\\" Axelrod called the film \\"pop porn or Dirty Disney. It may yet give bad taste a bad name.\\" =Shooting= Axelrod used as a music score the sound of teenagers with transistors. He based his visual style on the films of Richard Lester such as A Hard Day's Night and The Knack. \\"Lester has shown us a freer form,\\" said Axelrod. \\"I want to get away from the Hollywood syndrome of trying to make every shot look pretty and orderly.\\" The film was shot over 30 days for $850,000 (). \\"There's this gruesome prejudice in Hollywood that a picture made between $750,000 and $1 million cannot make a profit,\\" said Axelrod. \\"I want to prove that this is nonsense. If I could do that and find new ways of saying things the film at least will serve the useful purpose of puncturing a hole in Hollywood's adolescent mystique.\\" Release \\"We were worried about The Loved One,\\" said Axelrod before the film came out. \\"We were afraid it might give bad taste a bad name. But I think we're alright. If the picture comes off well I may get an Oscar. If it comes off very well I may get deported.\\" The film was a financial failure. \\"I can't imagine why it wasn't a hit,\\" said Axelrod. \\"It got no reaction. I couldn't get anybody into the theaters to see it. It was one of those pictures that died. United Artists sold the shit out of it. I went on the road with it. I got reams of press. I ran what I thought was a clever ad campaign, parodying all the other campaigns.\\" Awards Lola Albright won the Silver Bear for Best Actress award at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival in 1966.

The Old School, led by Charles Hodge of Princeton Theological Seminary, was much more conservative theologically and was not supportive of revivalism. It called for traditional Calvinist orthodoxy as outlined in the Westminster standards. The New School derived from the reconstructions of Calvinism by New England Congregationalist theologians Jonathan Edwards, Samuel Hopkins and Joseph Bellamy and wholly embraced revivalism. Though there was much diversity among them, the Edwardsian Calvinists commonly rejected what they called \\"Old Calvinism\\" in light of their understandings of God, the human person and the Bible. Later, both the Old School and New School branches further split over the issue of slavery, into Southern and Northern churches. After three decades of separate operation, the two sides of the controversy merged, in 1865 in the South and in 1870 in the North, to form two Presbyterian denominations (PCUS and PC-USA, in the South and North respectively). Origins of the controversy (1789–1837) = Origins of American Presbyterianism = During the 18th century, New England and Mid- Atlantic churchmen formed the first presbyteries in American colonies that would later become the United States. After resolving the Old Side–New Side Controversy in 1758, many reformed presbyterians reconciled into the Synod of New York and Philadelphia which reorganized after the American Revolution to become the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (P.C.U.S.A.). The first General Assembly of the P.C.U.S.A. met in Philadelphia in 1789. The new church was organized into four synods: New York and New Jersey, Philadelphia, Virginia, and the Carolinas. These synods included 16 presbyteries and an estimated membership of 18,000, and used the Westminster Standards as the main doctrinal standards. = Evangelistic Cooperation with Congregationalists = As a result of the Plan of Union of 1801 with the Congregationalist General Association of Connecticut, Presbyterian missionaries began to work with Congregationalist missionaries in western New York and the Northwest Territory to advance Christian evangelism. Many Presbyterians and Congregationalists took up the cause of foreign missions through the 1810 formation of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). Similarly, ecumenical \\"home missions\\" efforts became more formal under the auspices of the American Home Missionary Society, founded in 1826. This missions emphasis resulted in new churches being formed with either Congregational or Presbyterian forms of government, or a mixture of the two, supported by older established churches with a different form of government, and often clergy in controversy with their own congregations that disagreed with their ecclesiology and polity. It also resulted in a difference in doctrinal commitment and views among churches in close fellowship, leading to suspicion and controversy. =Controversies during the Second Great Awakening= Collectively, Unitarianism, Revivalism and Abolition introduced tensions among Presbyterian leaders who questioned the continued intermingling with the Congregationalist influence. Unitarianism Throughout the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregationalist ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties. When the Harvard Divinity School Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, the overseer of the college Jedidiah Morse demanded that orthodox men be elected. Nevertheless, after much struggle the Unitarian Henry Ware was elected in 1805, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional, Calvinist ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas). The appointment of Ware, with the election of the liberal Samuel Webber to the presidency of Harvard two years later, led Jedidiah Morse and other conservatives to found the Andover Theological Seminary as an orthodox, trinitarian alternative to the Harvard Divinity School.  Revivalism and New Haven theology In the U.S. the Second Great Awakening (1800–30s) was the second great religious revival in United States history and consisted of renewed personal salvation experienced in revival meetings. Presbyterian Rev. Charles Finney (1792–1875) was a key leader of the evangelical revival movement in America. From 1821 onwards he conducted revival meetings across many north-eastern states and won many converts. For him, a revival was not a miracle but a change of mindset that was ultimately a matter for the individual's free will. His revival meetings created anxiety in a penitent's mind that one could only save his or her soul by submission to the will of God, as illustrated by Finney's quotations from the Bible. In the West (now Upper South) especially—at Cane Ridge, Kentucky and in Tennessee—the revival strengthened the Methodists and Baptists. The Churches of Christ and Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) arose from the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. It also introduced into America a new form of religious expression—the Scottish camp meeting. In the 1820s, Nathaniel William Taylor, (appointed Professor of Didactic Theology at Yale Divinity School in 1822), was the leading figure behind a smaller strand of Edwardsian Calvinism which came to be called \\"the New Haven theology\\". Taylor developed Edwardsian Calvinism further, interpreting regeneration in ways he thought consistent with Edwards and his New England followers and appropriate for the work of revivalism, and used his influence to publicly support the revivalist movement and defend its beliefs and practices against opponents. The Old School rejected this idea as heresy, suspicious as they were of all New School revivalism.  Abolition In New England, the renewed interest in religion inspired a wave of social activism, including abolitionism. In 1834, students at Cincinnati's Lane Theological Seminary (a Presbyterian institution) famously debated \\"abolition versus colonialization\\" and voted overwhelmingly for immediate, rather than gradual, abolition. After being censored by the seminary's board and then its president Lyman Beecher, many theological students (known as the Lane Rebels) left Lane to join Oberlin College, a Congregationalist institution in northern Ohio founded in 1833, which accepted their abolitionist principles and became an Underground Railroad stop. = Break Point = The controversy reached a climax at a meeting of the general assembly in Philadelphia in 1836 when the Old School party found themselves in the majority and voted to annul the Plan of Union as unconstitutionally adopted. They then voted to expel the synods of Western Reserve (which included Oberlin as a part of Lorain County, Ohio), Utica, Geneva, and Genesee, because they were formed on the basis of the Plan of Union. At the General Assembly of 1837, these synods were refused recognition as lawfully part of the meeting. These and others who sympathized with them departed and formed their own general assembly meeting in another church building nearby, setting the stage for a court dispute about which of the two general assemblies constituted the true continuing Presbyterian church. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided that the Old School Assembly was the true representative of the Presbyterian church and their decisions would govern.Commonwealth v. Green, 4 Wharton 531, 1839 Pa. LEXIS 238 (1839).  Schism into \\"Old School\\" and New School\\" Presbyterians (1837–1857)  This 1837 event left two separate organizations, the Old School Presbyterians, and the New School Presbyterians. Generally speaking, the Old School was attractive to the more recent Scotch Irish element, while the New School appealed to more established Yankees (who by agreement became Presbyterians instead of Congregationalists when they left New England). =Old School Presbyterians = Theologically, The Old School, led by Charles Hodge of Princeton Theological Seminary, was much more conservative and was not supportive of revivals. It called for traditional Calvinist orthodoxy as outlined in the Westminster standards. Prominent members of the Old School included Ashbel Green, George Junkin, William Latta, Charles Hodge, William Buell Sprague, and Samuel Stanhope Smith. Schools associated with the Old School included Princeton Divinity School and Andover Theological Seminary. =New School Presbyterians= Theologically, The New School derived from the reconstructions of Calvinism by New England Puritans Jonathan Edwards, Samuel Hopkins and Joseph Bellamy and wholly embraced revivalism. Though there was much diversity among them, the Edwardsian Calvinists commonly rejected what they called \\"Old Calvinism\\" in light of their understandings of God, the human person and the Bible. The New School Presbyterians continued to participate in partnerships with the Congregationalists and their New Divinity \\"methods.\\" They sat on boards such as the American Home Missions Society and the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Prominent members of the New School included Nathaniel William Taylor, Eleazar T. Fitch, Chauncey Goodrich, Albert Barnes, Lyman Beecher (the father of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher), Henry Boynton Smith, Erskine Mason, George Duffield, Nathan Beman, Charles Finney, George Cheever, Samuel Fisher, Available via Internet Archive. and Thomas McAuley. Schools associated with the New School included Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati and Yale Divinity School.  Two become Four: Internal divisions over slavery (1857–1861) As the debate over slavery and abolition ratcheted up in the 1840s and 1850s, both the New School and the Old School began to experience internal tensions, largely along North- South (abolitionism vs. pro-slavery) lines. As the ABCFM and AHMS refused to take positions on slavery, some Presbyterian churches joined the abolitionist American Missionary Association instead, and even became Congregationalists or Free Presbyterians. African-American Presbyterian pastor Theodore S. Wright helped to form anti-slavery societies, such as the American Anti-Slavery Society and the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society. New School Presbyterian Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, advocated for rifles (\\"Beecher's Bibles\\") to be sent through the New England Emigrant Aid Company to address the pro-slavery violence in Kansas. While Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin made the case against slavery, her husband continued to teach at Andover Theological Seminary. In 1857, the New School Presbyterians wound up dividing over slavery, with the Southern New School Presbyterians forming the United Synod of the Presbyterian Church.D.G. Hart & John Meuther, Seeking a Better Country: 300 Years of American Presbyterianism [P&R; Publishing 2007 ], pg. 153 Despite the tensions, the Old School Presbyterians managed to stay united for several more years. However, in the summer of 1861, the Old School General Assembly, in a vote of 156 to 66, passed the Gardiner Spring Resolutions which called for the Old School Presbyterians to support the Federal Government. In order to attempt to alleviate the situation, the Assembly added language which clarified that the term \\"Federal Government\\" referred to \\"not any particular administration, or the peculiar opinions of any particular party,\\" but to \\"the central administration....appointed and inaugurated according to the forms prescribed in the Constitution of the United States...\\" Inevitably, though, Southern Old School Presbyterians wound up departing, and on December 4, 1861, the first General Assembly of the new Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America was held in Augusta, Georgia.Hart & Meuther, pg. 150 Thus at the beginning of the Civil War there were ***four*** related branches of American Presbyterians: The Northern New School, the Northern Old School, the Southern New School, and the Southern Old School.  Four Become Two: Northern Presbyterians and Southern Presbyterians (1860s) During the 1860s, the Old School and New School factions reunited to become Northern Presbyterians (PC- USA) and Southern Presbyterians (PCUS). In the South, the issue of the merger of Old School and New School Presbyterians had come up as early as 1861. Some old schoolers such as James Henley Thornwell opposed the merger, but Thornwell's death in 1862 removed a significant amount of opposition to merger, and at the 1863 General Assembly of the PCCS, a committee, headed by Robert Lewis Dabney, was formed to confer with a committee formed by the United Synod.Hart & Meuther, pg. 159 While some conservatives felt that union with United Synod would be a repudiation of Old School convictions, others, such as Dabney feared that should the union fail, the United Synod would most likely establish its own seminary, propagating New School Presbyterian theology. Ultimately, in 1864, the United Synod of the South merged with the PCCS, which would be renamed the Presbyterian Church in the United States following the end of the Civil War in 1865. In the North, Presbyterians wound up following a similar path to reunion. Both Old School and New School Presbyterians in the North had shared similar convictions regarding support of the Federal Government, although support of the Federal Government was not as unanimous amongst Northern Old School Presbyterians. The major issue was slavery, and while the Old School Presbyterians had been reluctant to debate the issue (which had preserved the unity of Old School Presbyterians until 1861) by 1864, the Old School had adopted a more mainstream position, and both shifts wound up moving the Old School and New Schoolers closer to union. Eventually, in 1867, the Plan of Union was presented to the General Synods of both the Old School and New School Presbyterians in the North. With some Presbyterians on the border states having left the PC-USA in favor of the PCUS, opposition wound up being reduced to a small faction of Old School holdovers such as Charles Hodge (raising concerns over the New School's fairly loose stance regarding confessional subscription), who, while preventing as much of a decisive victory in favor of reunion at the 1868 General Assembly, nevertheless failed to prevent the Old School General Assembly from approving the motion that the Plan of Union be sent to the presbyteries for their approval. The Plan of Union was eventually approved, and in 1869, the Old and New Schools reunited. Aftermath of reunion = PCUS in the South = Amongst the Southern Presbyterians, the reunion of the Old School and New School factions failed to create a major effect. The New School Presbyterians of the South simply wound up being absorbed into the larger Old School Presbyterian faction. Shifts in theological attitudes in the PCUS would not begin until the 1920s and 1930s. = PC-USA in the North = Amongst Northern Presbyterians, the effect of the reunion was felt soon after. The PC-USA eventually found itself becoming increasingly ecumenical and supporting various social causes. At the same time, the PC-USA also became increasingly lax in doctrinal subscription, and New School attempts to modify Calvinism would become embodied in the 1903 revision of the Westminster Standards. In time, the PC-USA would eventually welcome the Arminian Cumberland Presbyterians into their fold (1906), and incidences such as the Charles A. Briggs trial of 1893 would become simply a precursor of the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s. See also * American Presbyterianism References Bibliography * Gutjahr Paul C.

Early life In the early 20th century, Sadowski studied mechanics at the Lviv Polytechnic, and there he got in touch with Polish independence movement. He became a member of the Polish Socialist Party - Revolutionary Fraction, as well as the Polish Rifles and the Sokół movement. Military career After the outbreak of World War I, he joined the 1st Legionnaire Rifles Regiment as a volunteer. In 1914, he distinguished himself in battles at Anielin and Łaski, and the next year he fought at Łowiczowek, Konary and Jozefowek. In 1916, as a soldier of the I Brigade of the Polish Legions, he fought in the bloody battle of Kostiuchnówka. After the Oath crisis, Sadowski, together with many other officers, was interned in a prisoner of war camp in Beniaminów. In the Second Polish Republic, Sadowski, then a major, was an instructor at the School of Infantry Officers in Warsaw. In 1919 he entered the Polish Army Headquarters' School in Warsaw, then was sent on a two-year course to Ecole Superieure de Guerre in Paris. After graduation, Sadowski was promoted to colonel and became commandant of the elite 15. \\"Wolves\\" Infantry Regiment in Dęblin. Later on, in 1931, he was named commandant of the Polish 23rd Infantry Division, stationed in Katowice. On March 19, 1939, Sadowski was promoted to general, and took command of the freshly created Fortified Area of Silesia. During the opening phase of the Second World War, the Invasion of Poland, he was commandant of the Operational Group Silesia, which was part of the Kraków Army. His units were engaged in heavy fights with the advancing Wehrmacht, especially in the area of Mikołów and Wyry. However, the Germans managed to break through the Polish defences and Sadowski ordered his men to retreat behind the Przemsza. In mid-September 1939 Edward Rydz-Śmigły reformed the Śląsk Operational Group into Operational Group Jagmin. Sadowski's troops participated in the defence of Kraków, then fought in the area of Kielce and finally, in the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski, where they were defeated. Surrendering to the Germans, Sadowski was kept in a POW camp in Wollenberg for the duration of the war. In 1946 he returned to Poland, where he was forced to move to the army reserve. Later life In 1976 his name once again became famous, when Sadowski, protesting against conferring Virtuti Militari to Leonid Brezhnev, together with other war weterans, left his own Virtuti Militari at the Jasna Góra Monastery. He authored several books, including Dzialania Grupy Operacyjnej \\"Śląsk\\" 1-3 września 1939 r. (Activities of the Śląsk Operational Group, September 1–3, 1939).

From 1929 until 1990, it operated as a movie theater under the name The Paramount Theater. In the 1990s, the theater was renovated, and its original name was restored. It is currently part of the Willard Arts Center arts complex, owned and operated by the Idaho Falls Art Council. History The Willard Arts Center, of which the renovated Colonial Theater is part After the citizens of Idaho Falls voted to change the city's name, in 1891, residents began talking about building a theater which could host vaudeville acts, road shows, and musical performances. In 1919, three local men, C.A. Spath of the Farmers and Merchant Bank, Dr. C.M., Cline, and S.K. Mittry, a local contractor, put up the money and materials to build the Colonial Theater, at a final cost of $175,000. The structure was built of steel, reinforced concrete, and brick, with a handsomely designed ivory colored terracotta front. It was billed as the largest theater in the Intermountain West, with an orchestra pit, eight dressing rooms, and 1,400 leather-upholstered mahogany seats. A modern ramp led to the balcony where 600 of the seats were located as well as four box seats. Because the theater was designed before modern public address systems were invented, the acoustics were designed to be superb. The theater opened on November 10, 1919, with the contemporary play John Ferguson, by Irish playwright St. John Greer Ervine. C.H. Lewis served as the Colonial's first manager. In 1929, the theater was converted to a movie house, and renamed the Paramount Theater. The first moving picture shown at the theater was in November 1929, Harold Lloyd's Welcome Danger. It was originally a silent film but at its preview it was eclipsed by a one-reel comedy with sound. Through the 1960s and 1970s the Paramount continued showing the latest in motion pictures. The ushers would dress in costumes that reflected whatever movie was being shown. It was run as a discount theater in the 1980s and finally by 1990 it was in such disrepair it was closed down. The Paramount Theater remained empty until 1994. There was talk of leveling the theater and building a parking garage. Restoration =Administration= The modern stage of the Colonial Theater In 1990, the Idaho Falls Arts Council was formed as a private, non-profit organization, with the mission to \\"promote, advocate, and present a broad spectrum of visual and performing arts in Eastern Idaho.\\" In 1994, the old theater's owners, Dick Clayton, Sr. and his son Steve Clayton, donated the theater and adjacent buildings to the Council. The Council soon launched a capital campaign to restore the space, which was deemed \\"the Phantom project.\\" An anonymous donor, \\"the Phantom,\\" had challenged the community to raise half of the total cost of the renovation by agreeing to match any donation to the center up to $950,000. The campaign was a success, and after three years, $4.2 million was raised to renovate the Colonial Theater and the adjacent buildings, turning them into a regional visual and performing arts center. The \\"Phantom\\" turned out to be a couple, Miles Jamison Willard and Virginia Willard, who also chaired the capital campaign. The renovated complex was named the Willard Arts Center, in their honor. When Miles Willard died on November 26, 2004 after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease, his viewing was held in the Willard Arts Center. =Architecture= During the Paramount Theater era, much of the theater's original architecture had been hidden. During the process of renovation, documents that appeared to be the original blueprints for the Colonial Theater were discovered within in a downstairs wall; those plans helped greatly with the restoration. During that same period, a local tradesman informed the theater that there was a beautiful stained glass window under the tiles above the marquee in the front of the theater. People believe that the window was covered over during a1952 renovation, after Fox Motion Picture Studios of Hollywood bought the theater. Workers also removed the soggy carpet to discover black and white tiles running the entire length of the lobby. Work- release inmates uncovered the original 1919 Greek neoclassical border, which runs along the entire ceiling of the lobby. Arts Council staff cleaned and restored this border to its original beauty. The original footlights were at the front of the stage protected by Plexiglas and were the primary colors used to light the stage until 2014 when they were replaced by modern lighting. It was decided at that time that the theater would revert to its original vaudeville name The Colonial Theatre, and that live performances would reign once again. On March 13, 1999, the renovated 988-seat Colonial Theater reopened to the public with a performance by jazz performer Ray Charles. The Colonial Theater today Since reopening, the theater has hosted between 16 and 18 performances each year; it is also available for rental by the public. In 2014, the Colonial Theater hosted over 25,000 patrons. The Colonial Theater is one of the only four historic theaters left in the state of Idaho; the other three are The Egyptian Theatre in Boise, The Panida in Sandpoint and The Virginia Theater in Shelley.

Creative Participation - originally a Lucien Lévy-Bruhl term from the 1920s for analysing social relations of cultural groupings, modified and revived by the German ethnologist V. Dahlheimer- rewrites the traditional participant observation approach and leaves more room for non-materialistic cognition. Dynamic movements which can not be measured from disconnected or relative viewpoints can be captured by means of feelings. Verification of data through creative participation is possible through practical conception only and can at best be validated by empirical means. Creative Participation seeks to counteract classical problems in social science like i.e. rigid defense of theory, personal ambition, and weight of tradition which can lead to social and personal fragmentation. In consumer psychology Creative Participation is defined as consumers' co-creation of novel and valuable products, services, ideas, consumption experiences with firms during their purchase or consumption process. According to \\"Need for Uniqueness\\"- theory, one of consumers' motivations for creative participation may come from their need for unique products. When consumers need to acquire the symbol of distinct self by unique products, they are driven to create. Creative Participation is also used as an educational training method. It can breakdown barriers between participants (and agencies), and encourage creative problem-solving, and the building of positive relationships. In the political world Creative Participation presents the theory and practice of innovative forms of political participation, i.e. citizens cooperate in public action to achieve a common good.

The name is also used to indicate subsequent publications containing such documents, in chronological order, with summaries of their essential contents, for which English diplomatics use usually the term \\"calendar.\\" Early history The growth of the correspondence of the Holy See is evident even by the end of the 2nd century. Probably from a very early date a copy was made of papal documents before their dispatch, and that the collection of these documents was preserved at the seat of the central administration of the Roman Church. At that time high officials of the Roman State administration, the imperial chancery, the Senate, the consuls, the provincial governments, had all official documents entered in such volumes and preserved in the archives. The books in which these documents were entered were called commentarii regesta, the latter word from regerere, to inscribe. The existence of such papal regesta can be proved for the 4th century and the succeeding era. In his polemic with Rufinus (\\"Apolog. adv. Rufinum\\", III, xx), St. Jerome refers to the archives (chartarium) of the Roman Church, where the letter of Pope Anastasius (399-401) on the controversy over the doctrines of Origen was preserved. There are also notices concerning the registration of papal letters in the documents of several popes of the 5th century. Thus Pope Zosimus in his letter of 22 Sept., 417, to the bishops of Africa refers to the fact that all the earlier negotiations with Coelestius had been examined at Rome (Coustant, \\"Epist. Rom. Pontif.\\", 955). Consequently, copies of the documents in question must have existed. From this time onwards it remained the fixed custom of the papal chancery to copy the official papers issued by it in registers. Surviving regesta From the centuries previous to the pontificate of Innocent III (1199–1216) there remain only fragments of the registry volumes of the papal chancery and these in large part merely in later copies. Nearly all the volumes of the papal regesta up to the end of the 12th century have disappeared. The most important fragments of this period that have been preserved are: nearly 850 letters, in three groups, of the Regesta of Pope Gregory I (590-604). An investigation proved that the original Regesta consisted of fourteen papyrus volumes, corresponding to the number of years of the pontificate, which were arranged according to indictions; that each of these volumes was divided into twelve parts, before each of which the name of the corresponding month was written. This indicates the plan of the earliest volumes of the papal Regesta. A manuscript of the Vatican archives contains letters of John VIII (872-882) from September 876 to the end of the pontificate. This is not an original register, but an 11th-century copy. Separate letters, fifty-five in number, belonging to the first four years of the pontificate of this pope, are in a manuscript of the 12th century in the British Museum (Ms. Add. 8874). The manuscript contains letters of Gelasius I (492-96), Pelagius I (556-561), Leo IV (847-55), John VIII (872-82), Stephen V (885-91), Alexander II (1061–73), and Urban II (1088–99). The study of the manuscript by Ewald [\\"Neues Archiv\\", V (1880), 275 sqq., 503 sqq.] led to important conclusions concerning the volumes of the Regesta. Another manuscript at Cambridge contains some seventy letters from the Regesta of Adrian IV (1154–59), Alexander III (1159–81), and Lucius III (1181–85) [see Löwenfeld in \\"Neues Archiv\\", X, 1885, 585 sqq.]. Again, large parts of the Regesta of Gregory VII (1073–85), namely 381 letters, are contained in a manuscript in the Vatican archives. This collection is also only an extract of the original Regesta. In it the letters are no longer arranged according to indictions, but according to the year of the pontificate. A fraction of the Regesta of the antipope Anacletus II (1130–38) containing thirty-eight letters has been preserved in a manuscript of Monte Cassino (Ewald in \\"Neues Archiv\\", III, 164 sqq.). Besides these collections of letters which have preserved fragments of the earliest papal Regesta, rich material is also to be found in the canonical collections of the Middle Ages. In part these collections go back directly or indirectly to the volumes of the Regesta of the papal archives, from which the authors of these collections, as Anselm of Lucca, and above all Deusdedit, gathered the greater part of their material. From the 13th century From Pope Innocent III onward the manuscript volumes of the papal Regesta still exist in the Vatican Archives. The Regesta of the 13th century are beautifully written parchment volumes. Yet the most of these in their present form have been made from older volumes. How these older volumes, the real original Regesta, were planned cannot be decided. From the 14th century onward, registry volumes of paper were used for the entering of the copies. However, when the popes returned from Avignon to Rome, these paper Regesta were left at Avignon, and copies of them were made in parchment registry volumes that were brought to Rome. At a later era, the original Regesta volumes were also brought to the Vatican Archives so that there are two series in existence for the Avignon epoch of the 14th century. From the 14th century onwards the volumes of the Regesta were generally made of paper. Numerous investigations have been made by various scholars as to the arrangement of the volumes of the Regesta, the rules or customs observed in the entering of the separate pieces, as to the question of whether the draft or the finished letter was copied, and as to many other matters in diplomatics, without reaching very certain results. In the 13th century the letters were divided into \\"Litteræ communes\\" and \\"Litteræ de curia\\" or \\"Curiales\\", the latter dealing mostly with affairs of general importance. At a later date other headings (litteræ secretæ, litteræ de beneficiis) were also introduced. Besides the regular Regesta of the papal letters made in the papal chancery, there were similar Regesta of the papal letters executed since the 14th century in the Apostolic Camera. From about the middle of the 14th century the registers of petitions were also preserved, in which were entered, not the papal documents, but the memorials to the pope, in reply to which the papal documents were issued. As historical sources As collections of the official documents of the papal chancery, the Regesta are a very important historical authority. For convenience in historical investigation various scholars have published in chronological order all known papal documents of large periods, with brief summaries of the contents of the letters. The three greatest collections of this kind are: *Philipp Jaffé, \\"Regesta Pontificum Romanorum ab condita ecclesia ad annum p. Chr. n. 1198\\"; 2nd ed. by S. Löwenfeld, F. Kaltenbrunner, P.

Chr. n. 1198 ad an. 1304 (2 vols., Berlin, 1874-75). The database \\"Regesta Pontificum Romanorum online\\" from the \\"Göttinger Papsturkundenwerk\\" will combine the several Regesta projects up to the year 1198. Letters of several popes taken from the volumes of the Regesta have been published by: Löwenfeld: \\"Epistolæ Pontificum Romanorum ineditæ\\" (Leipzig, 1885) taken from the manuscript at Cambridge; Rodenberg, \\"Epistolæ sæc. XIII e Regestis Rom. Pont. selectæ\\" (Berlin, 1883 —), in \\"Mon. Germ. Hist.\\" The Regesta of the letters of Gregory I were edited again by Ewald and Hartmann, \\"Gregorii I Registrum epistolarum\\" in \\"Mon. Germ. Hist.\\" (Berlin, 1891 —). The letters of Gregory VII were edited by Jaffé, \\"Monumenta Gregoriana\\" in \\"Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum\\" (2 vols., Berlin, 1868). As early as 1591 the records of John VIII were published from the manuscript in the Vatican. Of the popes of the 13th century, Pressuti edited (Rome, 1888–96) the Regesta on Honorarius III (1216–27) from the volumes of the Regesta in the Vatican Archives; the Regesta of the succeeding popes to Boniface VII (d. 1303) were edited by the members of the Ecole Françoisaise of Rome, the publication of the Regesta of all the popes being yet incomplete; after a group of Benedictines had issued the Regesta of Clement V (1305–14), the members of the Ecole Françoisaise began again with John XXII (1316–34), with the intention of publishing the Regesta of the Avignon popes to Gregory XI (1370–78). In this later series, besides the documents of general interest, they kept in view particularly those documents that bore on the history of France. For the later eras only the first numbers were published of the Regesta of Leo X (1513–21), edited by Cardinal Hergenröther (see under the different popes). In addition a number of works have been issued or are in course of publication that contain Regesta from the Vatican Regesta of the 14th century, bearing on special questions or on the history of various countries and dioceses, e.g., Werunsky, \\"Excerpts ex registris Clementis VI et Innocenti VI (Innsbruck, 1885); Ruezler, \\"Vatikanische Akten zur deutschen Geschichte in der Zeit Ludwigs des Bayern\\" (Munich, 1890).

The 2001 edition of X.509 ISO 9594-8/ITU-T Rec. X.509 (2001) The Directory: Public-key and attribute certificate frameworks specifies most (but not all) of the components of a Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI), based on X.509 attribute certificates (ACs). Later editions of X.509 (2005 and 2009) have added further components to the PMI, including a delegation service (in 2005 ISO 9594-8/ITU-T Rec. X.509 (2005) The Directory: Public-key and attribute certificate frameworks) and interdomain authorisation (in the 2009 edition ISO 9594-8/ITU-T Rec. X.509 (2009)). Privilege management infrastructures (PMIs) are to authorisation what public key infrastructures (PKIs) are to authentication. PMIs use attribute certificates (ACs) to hold user privileges, in the form of attributes, instead of public key certificates (PKCs) to hold public keys. PMIs have Sources of Authority (SoAs) and Attribute Authorities (AAs) that issue ACs to users, instead of certification authorities (CAs) that issue PKCs to users. Usually PMIs rely on an underlying PKI, since ACs have to be digitally signed by the issuing AA, and the PKI is used to validate the AA's signature. An X.509 AC is a generalisation of the well known X.509 public key certificate (PKC), in which the public key of the PKC has been replaced by any set of attributes of the certificate holder (or subject). Therefore, one could in theory use X.509 ACs to hold a user's public key as well as any other attribute of the user. (In a similar vein, X.509 PKCs can also be used to hold privilege attributes of the subject, by adding them to the subject directory attributes extension of an X.509 PKC). However, the life cycle of public keys and user privileges are usually very different, and therefore it isn't usually a good idea to combine both of them in the same certificate. Similarly, the authority that assigns a privilege to someone is usually different from the authority that certifies someone's public key. Therefore, it isn't usually a good idea to combine the functions of the SoA/AA and the CA in the same trusted authority. PMIs allow privileges and authorisations to be managed separately from keys and authentication. The first open source implementation of an X.509 PMI was built with funding under the EC PERMIS project, and the software is available from here. A description of the implementation can be found in.D.W.Chadwick, A. Otenko “The PERMIS X.509 Role Based Privilege Management Infrastructure”.

Volume 20, Issue 11, Pages 1341-1357, 10 X.509 ACs and PMIs are used today in Grids (see Grid computing), to assign privileges to users, and to carry the privileges around the Grid. In the most popular Grid privilege management system today, called VOMS,Alfieri, R., Cecchini, R., Ciaschini, V., Dell'Agnello, L., Frohner, A., Lorentey, K., Spataro, F., “From gridmap-file to VOMS: managing authorization in a Grid environment”. Future Generation Computer Systems. Vol. 21, no. 4, pp. 549-558. Apr. 2005 user privileges, in the shape of VO memberships and roles, are placed inside an X.509 AC by the VOMS server, signed by the VOMS server, and then embedded in the user's X.509 proxy certificate for carrying around the Grid. Because of the rise in popularity of XML SOAP based services, SAML attribute assertions are now more popular than X.509 ACs for transporting user attributes. However, they both have similar functionality, which is to strongly bind a set of privilege attributes to a user.

During the 1962 Algerian War of Independence, Algerian women fought as equals alongside men. They thus achieved a new sense of their own identity and a measure of acceptance from men. In the aftermath of the war, women maintained their new-found emancipation and became more involved in the development of the new state. Among the countries of the region, Algeria is regarded as a relatively liberal nation and the status of women reflects this. The constitution of Algeria guarantees equality between genders. Women can vote and run for political positions. Background Algeria on the map Algeria is a country in North Africa on the Mediterranean coast. After a prolonged rule by France, Algeria obtained independence from France in 1962. The Algerian Civil War (1991-2002) had a negative influence on women's wellbeing. 99% of the population is Arab-Berber, and a similar percentage is Muslim, predominantly Sunni.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/ag.html In Algeria, as in the rest of the MENA Region, women are traditionally regarded as weaker than men and expected to be subordinate to men. Algeria also has a strong culture of family honor, which is connected to women's modesty.http://countrystudies.us/algeria/59.htm Marriage and personal life The legal age for marriage is eighteen for women, twenty-one for men. Many Algerian women are getting married and starting families at much older ages than they did under French Rule. Education, work commitment, and changing social attitudes are the reasons for the change. In 2010, the total fertility rate was 1.76 children born/woman. This is a drop from 2.41 in 2009 and 7.12 in the 1970s just after the Algerian War of Independence from France. French colonizers opposed veiling because of their secular sovereign constitution and the concept of laïcité. The French secular constitution is based in the Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789, however, which intentionally confers rights in men and denies them to women. Algerians clung to Islamic veiling under French rule, and after independence actually increased its use. Education and employment Prior to the country's Independence, very few native Algerian women could read and write. This was the result of a French-imposed ban on Islamic education for the entire native Algerian population. Which also led to the shut down of many schools, until there were barely enough schools to fit the needs of the country. The remnants of this policy still manifests today in the significantly low literacy rate found in women over the age of 40. The literacy rate of women is still lower than that of men (it is female: 73.1% and male: 87.2% as of 2015 estimates, population 15 years and older). Post- Independence, North African and Algerian women enjoy many more human rights than their counterparts in neighboring and other African countries. Algerian women can inherit property, obtain a divorce, retain custody of their children, gain an education and work in many sectors of society. Women make up 70 percent of Algeria's lawyers and 60 percent of its judges. They also dominate the fields of medicine, healthcare and science. Increasingly, women contribute more to household income than men. As of 2007, sixty-five percent of university students are women, with more than 80% joining the workforce after graduation. They are encouraged by family members to become educated and contribute to Algerian society. Algerian women are among the first in North Africa to become taxi and bus drivers. Their numbers are also increasing in the police force and security positions. Role of women in the Algerian War Photograph of two Algerian women from Bou Saâda, c. 1906. Women fulfilled a number of different functions during the Algerian War. The majority of Muslim women who became active participants did so on the side of the National Liberation Front (FLN). The French included some women, both Muslim and French, in their war effort, but they were not as fully integrated, nor were they charged with the same breadth of tasks as their Algerian sisters. The total number of women involved in the conflict, as determined by post-war veteran registration, is numbered at 11,000, but it is possible that this number was significantly higher due to underreporting.De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000, p. 247. There exists a distinction between two different types of women who became involved, urban and rural. Urban women, who constituted about twenty percent of the overall force, had received some kind of education and usually chose to enter on the side of the FLN of their own accord.Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 120. Largely illiterate rural women, on the other hand, the remaining eighty percent, due to their geographic location in respect to the operations of FLN often became involved in the conflict as a result of proximity paired with force. Women operated in a number of different areas during the course of the rebellion. \\"Women participated actively as combatants, spies, fundraisers, as well as nurses, launderers, and cooks\\", \\"women assisted the male fighting forces in areas like transportation, communication and administration\\",De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000, p. 223. the range of involvement by a woman could include both combatant and non-combatant roles. While the majority of the tasks that women undertook centered on the realm of the non-combatant, those that surrounded the limited number that took part in acts of violence were more frequently noticed. The reality was that \\"rural women in maquis [rural areas] support networks\\" contained the overwhelming majority of those who participated. This is not to marginalize those women who did engage in acts of violence but simply to illustrate that they constituted in the minority. Education Education for both girls and boys are equal (93% and 95% respectively). Although Algerian women account for 53% enrolled in universities, they tend to be more focused on \\"traditional women careers\\" such as education and nursing. Algerian women are allowed to pick whatever career they choose to be in, but social/cultural norms and their husbands are the main obstacles in their way. The literacy rate for males are a little higher than female youth (94% and 89%). Overall, the education system is comparably equal, but the problem is if these women break traditional \\"gender based career roles\\", there would not be a lot of option for them to be hired. Political participation Prior to the war of independence, women were in general excluded from the political life. After independence in 1962, where women played an active role, they were badly represented in the building of the new state. During the first National Assembly, there were only 10 women out of the 194 members that were present. These women had all taken part in the war for independence. In the second meeting of the National Assembly, 2 out of 138 members were women. The uprising that took place in October 1988 brought in a new a new constitution introducing a multi-party system. This led to the creation of many associations, among them associations for feminists and women in general. These associations made women more visible on the public arena. The four most visible and important among these associations were “equal rights for men and women”; “the triumph of women’s rights”; “the defence and promotion of women” and “the emancipation of women”. From 1981 to 1991, women were proportionally represented in the small and marginal parties of the extreme left side. The Workers Party (PT) was led by a woman: Louisa Hanoune. Both the parties at the left wing and FLN represented women candidates at elections. The religious Islamist parties did not represent women candidates at elections, but women were allowed to be members. Today, women are represented, although still not proportionally to men, in both parliament and in ministerial positions. In 2012, Algerian women occupied 31 percent of parliamentary seats, placing the country 26th worldwide and 1st in the Arab world. In 2012 political reforms were established, with the support of the United Nations Development Program, to provide a legal framework that granted women 30 percent representation in elected assemblies. On the local level, the rate is only 18 percent, due to the fact that it is difficult to find women willing to appear on ballots in the communes. Following President Bouteflika's re-election in 2014, seven women were appointed as ministers in his cabinet. This adds up to 20 percent of all the ministerial positions. The women occupying the seven new ministerial posts are: Minister of Education Nouria Benghebrit; Minister of Land-Use Planning and Environment Dalila Boudjemaa; Minister of Culture Nadia Labidi; Minister of Family and Women Mounia Meslem; Minister of Post, Information Technology and Communication Zahra Dardouri; Minister of Tourism Nouria Yamina Zerhouni and Delegate Minister of Handicrafts Aish Tabagho. There has until this day not been a female head of state. Louisa Hanoune became the first women in both Algeria and the Arab world to run for office in 2004. Economic participation When it comes to owning land, women are at a major disadvantage. Their access to owning land is limited by the traditional laws of Algeria. Even through Algerian women by law have the right to access bank loans and are free to negotiate financial or business contracts, these actions are usually restricted by their husbands. Women in the workforce accounted for 37% versus men who accounted for 80%. The youth unemployment rate for males (43%) was slight lower than it was for females (46%). 60% of Algerian women are employed, but only half are on a salaried status. Basically speaking, the majority of women do not benefit from their employ ability status. Most Algerian women are employed by public administration and they occupy a lot of the teaching professions and \\"traditional\\" women careers in Algeria. \\"One exception is the medical profession; more than half of Algeria's doctors are women.\\" In the year 2002, the National Committee of Working Women provided a center to help victims of sexual harassment in the workplace. In addition, there has been activists who have been campaigning for there to be a law to protect women from sexual harassment in the workplace. Health In regards to reproductive services, 96 percent of births were attended by a skilled health staff in 2002. Maternal mortality is still an issue somewhat in Algeria with some differences in different areas of the region. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, maternal mortality rates were cut in half in ten years. The maternal mortality ration in 2010 was 1 in 430 women. In 2011, Algerian women's use of sanitation facilities were at 95.1%. From the years 2008 to 2011, the number of females who had a comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS at the ages of 15 to 24 years were 13.1%. 68% of women who were between the ages of 15 – 49 years thought that violence by their spouse was acceptable with in some certain situations. However, the people seemed that they did not believe in child marriage and only had 4 total in that year. Mothers seeking immunization for newborns and children ranged between 90% to 99% in the year 2012. Family life for women When it comes to legal protections for women in Algeria, the current protections in place are general/vague and insufficient. Women activists have had success bringing awareness to change the original family code to a more modernized equivalent benefiting and protecting women. The Family Code of 1984 is based on conservative religious principles. While the law was modified by Ordinance No. 05-02 of 27 February 2005, it still maintains many discriminatory provisions.

It is endemic to the Channel Islands of California, where it is known from about 26 populations on two of the islands.USFWS. Galium buxifolium Five-year Review. October 2009. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. This is a small shrub reaching one half to 1.2 meters in maximum height. It has leathery rounded leaves in whorls of four about its stems and white flowers. The floral biology of the plant is unusual. It is generally dioecious, but it may have unisexual and bisexual flowers on one plant, or all female or all bisexual flowers on a single plant. It can reproduce sexually or vegetatively by sprouting new plants from its root crown. The fruit is a hairy nutlet. This plant can be found on Santa Cruz and San Miguel Islands off Southern California coast. Surveys done after the plant was put on the endangered species list succeeded in locating new populations on the former. Parts of San Miguel Island are steep and rocky and there may be populations existing in inaccessible areas there. Many populations are small, containing just a few individuals. The plant once occurred on Santa Rosa Island, which is situated between Santa Cruz and San Miguel Islands, but specimens have not been collected there since 1930.USFWS, NPS, TNC, USGS, et al.

In rural Angola, as in many African economies, most of the population engaged in agricultural activities. Women performed much of the agricultural labor. Marriage generally involved familial, political, and economic interests as well as personal considerations and gains. The household was the most important unit of production and was usually composed of several generations. The women grew and prepared most of the food for the household and performed all other domestic work. Because of their major role in food production, women shared relatively equal status with men, who spent much of their time hunting or tending cattle. It has been calculated that almost 25 million adults and children were living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa at the end of 2005. During 2005, an estimated two million AIDS-related deaths occurred in Africa, leaving behind some twelve million orphans.Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) ( 2004 ). Report on the global AIDS epidemic . : UNAIDS . A study of nearly 2000 individuals in 2005 shows that intervention programs that promote condom use are very effective in reducing this number, by addressing common myths surrounding birth control.Prata, Ndola, et al. “Gender and Relationship Differences in Condom Use among 15-24-Year-Olds in Angola.” International Family Planning Perspectives, vol. 31, no. 4, 2005, pp. 192–199.

Angola has a high breast cancer mortality rate, which has been attributed to a lack of symptom awareness that leads to a late diagnosis. In a survey of 595 students in university, around 65% were not aware that breast cancer was one of the deadliest cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa, and less than 35% knew that it could also affect men. Progress is being made to use universities as well as popular social media networks (Facebook, Twitter) to further teach students about awareness and self-examinations, which students also admitted that they were not familiar with.Sambanje, M N, and B Mafuvadze. “Breast cancer knowledge and awareness among university students in Angola.” Pan African Medical Journal, 64 Apr. 2012. African Journals Online. Many women belonged to the Organization of Angolan Women (Organização da Mulher Angolana—OMA). Before independence, the OMA was instrumental in mobilizing political support for the MPLA among thousands of Angolan refugees. After independence, and especially after the creation of the MPLA-PT in 1977, the mass organizations came under the strict control of the party and were given the role of intermediaries between the MPLA-PT and the population. Women's participation in the government has not increased at the rate that participation in other countries with similar political environments have, but women-friendly policies have still been enacted since the 1980s. As stated in the Quota Project of 2012, the National Assembly (Angola) consisted of 35% women, and the number of female justices in Constitutional Court of Angola was 4 out of 11.Tripp, Aili Mari. Women and Power in Post-Conflict Africa. Cambridge University, 2015. Angolan media is also to blame for the gender- stereotyped roles present in current day Angola. One example of this can be found the highly publicized Miss Angola program, endorsed by many provinces of Angola who spend large sums of money promoting the event.Ducados, Henda. \\"Angolan women in the aftermath of conflict.\\" From Military Peace to Social Justice? The Angolan Peace Process (2004). Another program of which the Angolan government created in order to elevate women's status is the Ministry for Family and Women, a group that helped separate women's issues from the political agenda. However, even with new programs like these, little progress has been made to institutionalize proper programs to reform issues such as voting rates and pregnancy awareness. The Ministry for Family and Women continues to be one of the most underfunded programs in Angola, giving it little room to expand or produce tangible results.Ducados, Henda. \\"Angolan women in the aftermath of conflict.\\" From Military Peace to Social Justice? The Angolan Peace Process (2004). In 1987, the OMA had a membership of 1.3 million women, most of whom lived in rural areas. Among the many contributions of OMA's members were the establishment of literacy programs and service in health and social service organizations. Most OMA members, however, were poor and unemployed. In 1988 only 10 percent of MPLA-PT members were women, although more women found jobs in teaching and professions where they had been excluded in the past. References (Data as of 1989.)

Apostolic constitutions are the highest form of papal teaching, above encyclicals, below dogmatization ex cathedra. The Sodality of Our Lady dates to 1584. It consists of associations of persons, sodalists, dedicated to a Christian life, following the model of the Virgin Mary.  Importance to the Church  The Salus Populi Romani was venerated by Marian sodalities. A rare picture of Salus Populi Romani crowned for the Marian year 1954 by Pope Pius XII Pope Pius XII expressed his support of the Marian Congregations. He described the Sodality as authentic \\"Catholic Action under the auspices and inspiration of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\"\\"History of Sodality\\", Sodality Union Archdiocese of Washington and called for its renewal in the post war era. The Pope established guidelines for the lay apostolate. Pope Pius praised the Sodality for its \\"numerous and great services to the Church\\" and says of Sodalists \\"Indeed in propagating, spreading and defending Catholic doctrine they must be considered among the most powerful spiritual forces\\". Of the Rules of the Sodality he says \\"through them the members are perfectly lead to that perfection of spiritual life from which they can scale the heights of sanctity\\" and adds that \\"wherever Sodalities are in a flourishing condition - holiness of life and solid attachment to religion readily grow and flourish\\". He illustrates the point by adding that \\"the fact that they ever had the common good of the Church at heart and not some private interest is proved by the unimpeachable witness of that most brilliant series of Sodalists to whom Mother Church has decreed the supreme honours of the Altars; their glory throws lustre not merely on the Society of Jesus but on the secular clergy and on not a few religious families, since ten members of the Sodalities of Our Lady became founders of new Religious Orders and Congregations\\".Bis saeculari 21 Because of their loyalty to the Church, they are welcome helpers of the hierarchies. In the future, twelve principles should be observed for sodalities to continue as an effective Church organization. The principles describe the continued value of existing rules, membership based on strict selections, Marian orientation not only in name, leadership by priests, clear but limited rights for priests and bishops, religious education of its members, and, cooperation with other lay organizations.Bis saeculari 26 Bis saeculari had the effect of reinvigorating the movement, eventually leading to formation of national and international federations.O'Toole, James M., Habits of Devotion: Catholic Religious Practice in Twentieth-century America, Cornell University Press, 2004  Quotations  * Any kind of apostolate belongs to the goals of sodalities, especially social obligations, the spreading of the kingdom of Christ, and the defence of the rights of the Church.Bis saeculari 38 * The “perfect Catholic” formed by the Sodality, corresponds to the needs of our days no less than in previous times. More than ever before, we need men formed in the principles of Christian life.Bis saeculari 9 * Sodalists should only be accepted, if they are in no way content with an average way of living.

Steffen achieved fame as a leading man in Spaghetti Western features. He was also known as Antonio Luigi de Teffe. Biography Born Antonio Luiz de Teffé von Hoonholtz at the Brazilian embassy in Rome, in the Pamphilj Palace, his family had noble blood of a long lineage of Count (von Hoonholtz) originally from Prussia; his great grandfather was the Great Baron of Tefé. Steffen was the first born among Manoel de Teffe' von Hoonholtz's children (followed by Federico de Teffe' and Melissa de Teffe'), who was a Formula One racing champion and later a Brazilian Ambassador. Steffen's grandaunt was Nair de Tefé von Hoonholtz, the first female caricaturist of Brazil and wife of Brazilian President Hermes Fonseca. While still a teenager Steffen, then known as Antonio, fought in World War II along the Italian partisans against the Nazis. Later and under the name Antonio de Teffé, he worked behind the scenes in several Italian productions in the early 1950s and later acted in several movies, but never really achieving stardom. In 1962, he had a bit part in Sodom and Gomorrah. An early appearance of his was in the 1955 Gli Sbandati. From 1965 to 1975, the newly named Anthony Steffen achieved considerable fame in Europe, amassing cult status, starring in 27 Spaghetti Westerns. Considered to be an \\"Italian Clint Eastwood\\", he was sometimes unfairly criticized for being a stiff or wooden actor. Several of his movies were sizeable box office hits in Europe. Django the Bastard (aka Stranger's Gundown, 1969) a movie that was produced and written by Steffen, is considered to be an inspiration for Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter. In several of his movies, Steffen starred alongside other Spaghetti Western luminaries such as Gianni Garko, Peter Lee Lawrence, and William Berger. Outside of the Spaghetti western genre, Steffen also appeared in several Giallo movies including The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave (1971). His roles and status diminished as the Spaghetti Western genre fell into decline. Amassing a considerable fortune from his career as an actor, Steffen embarked on a jet set lifestyle. In his career Steffen performed alongside Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Claudia Cardinale, Elke Sommer, Giuliano Gemma, Franco Nero, Gian Maria Volonté, Esmeralda Barros and many other stars of the American and Italian cinema. Always considered a huge star in Brazil because of the Spaghetti Western popularity in the South American country, Steffen returned to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the decade of 1980, until dying of cancer in 2004. He has maintained cult-status among fans of Italian Cinema for being perhaps the most prolific Spaghetti Western Leading actor.

In 1290, after Ralph de Hengham had been dismissed from the King's Bench, Brabazon was hired as a junior justice. In 1291–1292, Brabazon took part in hearing the 'Great Cause' concerning Edward I's overlordship over Scotland, and pronounced the judgement in favour of John Balliol as heir to the Scottish crown. Upon the death of Gilbert de Thornton in 1295, Brabazon was then appointed Chief Justice of the King's Bench, a position he held until old age and infirmity forced him to resign in 1316. Brabazon married Beatrice, daughter of Warin of Bassingbourn, at some point between 1281 and 1284. With his own and his wife's inheritance, combined with later acquisitions, he held extensive lands in the county of Leicestershire. He died on either 13 June or 14 June 1317, and as he left no issue, his heir was his brother Matthew.

Although the Mobutu regime paid lip service to the important role of women in society, and although women enjoy some legal rights (e.g., the right to own property and the right to participate in the economic and political sectors), custom and legal constraints still limit their opportunities. The inferiority of women has always been embedded in the indigenous social system and reemphasized in the colonial era. The colonial-era status of African women in urban areas was low. Adult women were legitimate urban dwellers if they were wives, widows, or elderly. Otherwise they were presumed to be femmes libres (free women) and were taxed as income-earning prostitutes, whether they were or not. From 1939 to 1943, over 30% of adult Congolese women in Stanleyville (now Kisangani) were so registered. The taxes they paid constituted the second largest source of tax revenue for Stanleyville.  Social issues  = Sexual violence = The war situation has made the life of women more precarious. Violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal. In July 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross expressed concern about the situation in eastern DRC. A phenomenon of 'pendulum displacement' has developed, where people hasten at night to safety. According to Yakin Ertürk, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women who toured eastern Congo in July 2007, violence against women in North and South Kivu included “unimaginable brutality”. \\"Armed groups attack local communities, loot, rape, kidnap women and children and make them work as sexual slaves,\\" Ertürk said. A local initiative by women in Bukavu aims for recovery from violence based on women's own empowerment. In December 2008 GuardianFilms posted a film on the Guardian newspaper website profiling a project to record the testimony of over 400 women and girls who had been abused by marauding militia. = Female genital mutilation = Besides war rape in Congo's civil wars, there are other serious threats to women's physical well-being in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Female genital mutilation (FGM), while not widespread, exists among some populations in northern parts of the DRC.

Trafficking in Persons Report 2010. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). = Prostitution = Food insecurity and extreme poverty are now the main reasons why women in the DRC become prostitutes. Traders make up the majority of clients, along with officials working for national and international NGOs. Many sex workers earn between $2 and $5 and payment is sometimes made in the form of food or other goods. Prostitutes working in bars and nightclubs receive between $10 and $20, and are known as \\"Londoners\\" as they dress like British girls on a Saturday night out. \\"VIP prostitution\\" operates from hotels, with sex workers earning between $50 and $100. Many Congolese prostitutes are from abroad or homeless children who have been accused of witchcraft.  Economy and society  “There were food taboos which restrict women from eating certain foods (usually the most desirable) since ‘they are not the equals of men.’ Women may not eat in the presence of other men, and they are often allowed only their husband's leftovers.” UN, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/ - Reports may be accessed at http://www.bayefsky.com 1997 25. As cited in www.womanstats.org. = Urban women = Opportunities for wage labor jobs and professional positions remained rare even after independence. For example, in Kisangani there were no women in law, medicine, or government in 1979, nineteen years after independence. Moreover, educational opportunities for girls remained constricted compared with those for boys. By the 1990s, women had made strides in the professional world, and a growing number of women now work in the professions, government service, the military, and the universities. But they remain underrepresented in the formal work force, especially in higher-level jobs, and generally earn less than their male counterparts in the same jobs. In addition, certain laws clearly state that women are legally subservient to men. A married woman must have her husband's permission to open a bank account, accept a job, obtain a commercial license, or rent or sell real estate. Article 45 of the civil code specifies that the husband has rights to his wife's goods, even if their marriage contract states that each spouse separately owns his or her own goods. Women have to get the approval of their husband before getting any sort of job offer. Adapting to this situation, urban women have exploited commercial opportunities in the informal economy, outside of men's control. They generally conduct business without bank accounts, without accounting records, and without reporting all of their commerce. Anthropologist Janet MacGaffey's study of enterprises in Kisangani showed that 28 percent of the city's large business owners not dependent on political connections were women; these women specialized in long-distance distribution and retail and semi-wholesale trade. About 21 percent of the retail stores in the commercial and administrative zone of the city were women's, and women dominated the market trade. = Rural women = Women returning from their vegetable gardens with cassava and firewood. Rural women find fewer such strategies available. Saddled with the bulk of agricultural work, firewood gathering, water hauling, and child care, they have generally seen an increase in their labor burdens as the economy has deteriorated. In the DRC's eastern highlands, conditions have grown particularly severe. The state promoted expansion of cash crop hectarage for export, particularly of coffee and quinine, has reduced the amount and quality of land available for peasant household food-crop production. Plantations owned by the politico-commercial and new commercial elites have increasingly expanded onto communal lands, displacing existing food crops with cash crops. Within peasant households, men's control of the allocation of household land for export and food crops has led to greater use of land for export crops, and the diminution of women's access to land and food crops. Even when male producers turn to cultivating food crops, the household does not necessarily profit nutritionally. Food needed for household consumption is frequently sold for cash, cash needed to pay for daily necessities, clothes, school fees, taxes, and so on. Higher-priced and nutritionally superior food crops such as sorghum are frequently sold by producers who eat only their cheaper, less nutritious food crops such as cassava. Widespread malnutrition among children has resulted. Among groups where women have more power, the situation is less severe. Among the Lemba, for example, women not only have more say in determining what is grown but also in what is consumed. In a country where the most widespread pattern is for the men to be served the best food first, with the remainder going to women and children, Lemba women traditionally set aside choice food items and sauces for their own and their children's consumption before feeding the men their food. Their nutritional status and that of their children is correspondingly better. Rural women have arguably borne the brunt of state exactions. In some cases, women have banded together to resist the rising tolls and taxes imposed on them. Political scientist Katharine Newbury studied a group of Tembo women growers of cassava and peanuts west of Lac Kivu who successfully protested against the imposition of excessive collectivity taxes and market taxes levied on them when they went to market. The local chief was hostile. But a sympathetic local Catholic church, which provided a forum for meetings and assistance in letter writing, was helpful, as was the ethnic homogeneity of the group. Although they could not nominate a woman for election to the local council, they did succeed in voting for males friendly to their position. The newly elected councillors hastened to suspend the taxes and the tolls.  Women's organizations  Not all women's organizations have been equally successful. In Kisangani the Association of Women Merchants (Association des Femmes Commerçantes—Afco) failed to advance the interests of the assembled women merchants. The group instead turned into a vehicle for class interests, namely those of the middle-class president. MacGaffey clearly saw the case as one of the triumph of class solidarity over gender solidarity. A continuing challenge for women has been the limited integration of women's experience and perspectives into the development initiatives of Western development agencies. As Brooke Schoepf has documented, little effort has been made to create agricultural extension networks for women, who have continued to contribute the overwhelming bulk of agricultural labor. In addition, project production goals rarely have taken into account the effect of the withdrawal of women's time from current food production and household work to meet the goals of the new programs. Development in such a context often has meant a step backward rather than a step forward from the perspective of the women being \\"developed\\". The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2006 expressed concern that in the post-war transition period, the promotion of women’s human rights and gender equality is not seen as a priority. A 2006 report by the African Association for the Defence of Human Rights prepared for that committee provides a broad overview of issues confronting women in the DRC in law and in daily life. In 2015, diaspora figures such as Emmanuel Weyi began to comment on the plight affecting women, and the need to make their progress a key issue in the approaching democratic election (which didn't take place).

A supraglacial lake is any pond of liquid water on the top of a glacier. Although these pools are ephemeral, they may reach kilometers in diameter and be several meters deep. They may last for months or even decades at a time, but can empty in the course of hours. Lifetime Lakes may be created by surface melting during summer months, or over the period of years by rainfall, such as monsoons. They may dissipate by overflowing their banks, or creating a moulin. Effects on ice masses Lakes of a diameter greater than ~300 m are capable of driving a fluid-filled crevasse to the glacier/bed interface, through the process of hydrofracture. A surface-to-bed connection made in this way is referred to as a moulin. When these crevasses form, it can take a mere 2–18 hours to empty a lake, supplying warm water to the base of the glacier - lubricating the bed and causing the glacier to surge. The rate of emptying such a lake is equivalent to the rate of flow of the Niagara Falls. Such crevasses, when forming on ice shelves, may penetrate to the underlying ocean and contribute to the breakup of the ice shelf. Supraglacial lakes also have a warming effect on the glaciers; having a lower albedo than ice, the water absorbs more of the sun's energy, causing warming and (potentially) further melting. Context Supraglacial lakes can occur in all glaciated areas. The retreating glaciers of the Himalaya produce vast and long lived lakes, many kilometres in diameter and scores of metres deep. These may be bounded by moraines; some are deep enough to be density stratified. Most have been growing since the 1950s; the glaciers have been retreating constantly since then. A proliferation of supraglacial lakes preceded the collapse of the Antarctic Larsen B ice shelf in 2001, and may have been connected. Such lakes are also prominent in Greenland, where they have recently been understood to contribute somewhat to ice movement. Sediments Sedimentary particles often accumulate in supraglacial lakes; they are washed in by the meltwater or rainwater that supplies the lakes. The character of the sediment depends upon this water source, as well as the proximity of a sampled area to both the edge of the glacier and the edge of the lake. The amount of debris atop the glacier also has a large effect. Naturally, long lived lakes have a different sedimentary record to shorter lived pools. Sediments are dominated by coarser (coarse sand/gravel) fragments, and the accumulation rate can be immense: up to 1 metre per year near the shores of larger lakes. Upon melting of the glacier, deposits may be preserved as superglacial till (alias supraglacial moraine). Effect of global warming =Greenland Ice Sheet= It was once unclear whether global warming is increasing the abundance of supraglacial lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet.Details of supraglacial lake research from Sarah Das, a specialist. Contains images. However, recent research has shown that supraglacial lakes have been forming in new areas. In fact, satellite photos show that since the 1970s, when satellite measurements began, supraglacial lakes have been forming at steadily higher elevations on the ice sheet as warmer air temperatures have caused melting to occur at steadily higher elevations.Howat, I M, S de la Peña, J H van Angelen, J T M Lenaerts, and M R van den Broeke. 2013. “Expansion of Meltwater Lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet.” The Cryosphere 7 (1). doi:10.5194/tc-7-201-2013. However, satellite imagery and remote sensing data also reveal that high-elevation lakes rarely form new moulins there.Poinar, K, I Joughin, S B Das, and M D Behn. 2015. “Limits to Future Expansion of Surface‐Melt‐Enhanced Ice Flow Into the Interior of Western Greenland.” Geophysical Research Letters. doi:10.1002/2015GL063192. Thus, the role of supraglacial lakes in the basal hydrology of the ice sheet is unlikely to change in the near future: they will continue to bring water to the bed by forming moulins within a few tens of kilometers of the coast. =Himalaya= Climate change is having a more severe effect on supraglacial lakes on mountain glaciers. In the Himalaya, many glaciers are covered by a thick layer of rocks, dirt, and other debris; this debris layer insulates the ice from the warmth of the sun, allowing more ice to stay solid when air temperatures rise above the melting point. Water collecting on the ice surface has the opposite effect, due to its high albedo as described in a previous section. Thus, more supraglacial lakes lead to a vicious cycle of more melting and more supraglacial lakes.Benn, D I, T Bolch, K Hands, J Gulley, A Luckman, L I Nicholson, D Quincey, S Thompson, R Toumi, and S Wiseman. 2012. “Response of Debris-Covered Glaciers in the Mount Everest Region to Recent Warming, and Implications for Outburst Flood Hazards.” Earth- Science Reviews 114 (1-2). Elsevier B.V.: 156–74. doi:10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.03.008. A good example is the Ngozumpa glacier, the longest glacier in the Himalayas, which counts numerous supraglacial lakes. The drainage of supraglacial lakes on mountain glaciers can disrupt the internal plumbing structure of the glacier. Natural events such as landslides or the slow melting of a frozen moraine can incite drainage of a supraglacial lake, creating a glacial lake outburst flood. In such a flood, the lake water releases rushes down a valley. These events are sudden and catastrophic and thus provide little warning to people who live downstream, in the path of the water. In Himalayan regions, villages cluster around water sources, such as proglacial streams; these streams are the same pathways the glacial lake outburst floods travel down.

From the earliest preserved archaeological records, Egyptian women were considered nearly equal to men in Egyptian society, regardless of marital status. Women in ancient Egypt Cleopatra and Julius Caesar Two women holding large water jugs. One is carrying an infant (1878) Women were stated lower than men when it came to a higher leader in the Egyptian hierarchy counting his peasants. This hierarchy was similar to the way the peasants were treated in the Middle Ages. As children, females were raised to be solely dependent upon their fathers and older brothers. When women married, they depended on their husbands to make all decisions, while the women themselves were depended upon to carry out household chores. Married Egyptian women were expected by their husband's families to bear children, but particularly males. It was common for married couples to continue to reproduce until bearing at least two sons. Barrenness was considered a severe misfortune for Egyptian women, as well as the inability to produce male offspring. Women who had only bore females were given derogatory names, such as \\"mothers of brides\\". A family with well-grown sons was considered to have decent security. An Egyptian woman was thought to be at the peak of her power when her sons had married because she automatically acquired the control over the newly growing families of her sons. Women have traditionally been preoccupied with household tasks and child rearing and have rarely had opportunities for contact with men outside the family. Royal Egyptian women had great impact on Egyptian Society. Queen Tiye, the grandmother of King Tut was so enmeshed in politics that neighboring King Mitanni wrote to her to ensure good will between their people when her son Akhenaten ascended to the throne. Queen Aahmose was awarded the golden flies for military valor. Cleopatra and Nefertiti were among the better known rulers in Egyptian society. Cleopatra was known to have ruled with Marc Antony around 31 BC and she was also the Co-regent of her two husband-brothers and her son.paragraph 5, Lewis, Jone Johnson. 2006. Cleopatra. (accessed April 12, 2009) Nefertiti was the chief wife of an Egyptian pharaoh, Amenhotep IV. Nefertiti was known to be an active Egyptian woman in society, as well as her children.paragraph 2 Lewis, Jone Johnson. 2006. Cleopatra. (accessed April 12, 2009) In addition to female Egyptian rulers, Hatshepsut usurped the throne and reigned in Egypt as pharaoh from about 1503 to 1480 B.C. She based most of Egypt's economy on commerce.paragraph 1 El-Sayed, Sayed Z. 1995. Queen Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt: The first oceanographic cruise? (accessed April 12, 2009) Though not many women have acted as rulers in Egyptian society, they have been considered to be equal among men in status as well as legal opportunities. Women were shown to be allowed the opportunity to take part in the economy, such as their role as merchants, as it happened later in the Roman Empire, specially among the lower classes. Women had also taken part in religious activities, such as those who were priestesses. In the Sixth Dynasty Nebet became a Vizier and thus the first woman in History to fulfill such an office. Women could also own property, divorce their husbands, live alone and occupy main positions, mostly religious, in similarity with Assyrian women. Only the children from the Great Royal Wife could expect to succeed to the throne, and if there were no son but daughters by her, then a son by another wife or concubine could only get the throne by marrying the heir daughter, and whoever did so would become the new King. Either through political and/or religious power, some women managed to become, de facto or de jure, the highest office holders in the kingdom, and share a status of co- rulers with men, even being depicted in monuments with the same height as their husbands or otherwise and even as the other Gods of Egypt. Such were the cases of Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, Nefertari and the Nubian Egyptian Queens. The further Nubian Queens were able to maintain this status. The most important religious offices of that kind were those of God's Wife and God's Wife of Amun. Politically, they often managed to become Interregnum queens. In the Ptolemaic Dynasty this rise to power was sublimated with the establishment of a coregency system, in which Queens had the same position as Kings and were even powerful enough to obtain in dispute that coregency for themselves. 19th century Circa the 1890s, twice the percentage of women in Alexandria knew how to read compared to the same percentage in Cairo. As a result, specialist women's publications like al-Fatāh by Hind Nawal, the country's first women's journal, appeared.Kendall, Elisabeth. \\"Between Politics and Literature: Journals in Alexandria and Istanbul at the End of the Nineteenth Century\\" (Chapter 15).

Modern status Harem women make public speeches - \\"This is the first time that Egyptian women have been permitted freedom of speech in public\\" - June 1919 School girls visiting the Egyptian Temple of Isis from Philae Island (1995). To limit women's contact with men as tradition, practices such as veiling and gender segregation at schools, work, and recreation have become common. Furthermore, lower-class families, especially in Upper-Egypt, have tended to withdraw females from school as they reached puberty to minimize their interaction with males. Lower-class men frequently preferred marriage to women who had been secluded rather than to those who had worked or attended secondary school. The rule of Gamal Abdul Nasser was characterized by his policy of stridently advocating women's rights through welfare-state policies, labeled as state feminism. Women were guaranteed the right to vote and equality of opportunity was explicitly stated in the 1956 Egyptian constitution, forbidding gender-based discrimination. Labor laws were changed to ensure women's standing in the work force and maternity leave was legally protected. At the same time, the state repressed independent feminist organizations, leaving a dearth of female political representation. The economic liberalization plan of the Sadat regime resulted in the collapse of this system and the resurgence of Islamist-influenced policy. While the Nasserist years allowed a wide range of study for women, Sadat's policies narrowed the opportunities available to women. Unemployment for women changed from 5.8% 1960 to 40.7% in 1986. In place of policies to economically support women during pregnancy, women were encouraged to leave work entirely or work part-time. The Mubarak years were marked by further erosion of the role of women. Preserved parliamentary seats for women and the 1979 personal status law were repealed in 1987, a new watered-down law taking its place that allowed less power for women in cases of divorce. The migration of a large number of Egyptians, mostly men, has also affected the status of Egyptian women. A study by the International Organization for Migration found that two-thirds of migrant household interviewed were headed by a woman in the absence of the male migrant (husband/father). For these households, remittances represented an important source of income, accounting for 43% of their total income. 52% of wives of the migrants independently decided how to spend the money received. In the remaining cases, the head of the household enjoyed a fair deal of autonomy as the decision on how to use the remittance money was reached through mutual consultation between the migrant and the head of the household and only in a few cases (11%) did the migrant decide alone.International Organization for Migration, egypt.iom.int A 2010 Pew Research Center poll showed that 45% of Egyptian men and 76% of women supported gender equality. The same poll showed that, in principle, people tend to accept a woman's right to work outside the home, with 61% of the respondents agreeing that \\"women should be able to work outside the home\\", but at the same time showing some reservations, with only 11% of men and 36% of women completely agreeing with that statement; and 75% agreeing that \\"when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job\\".http://www.pewglobal.org/files/pdf/Pew-Global-Attitudes-2010-Gender- Report.pdf Polls taken in 2010 and 2011 show that 39% considered gender equality \\"very important\\" to Egypt's future post-revolution and 54% of Egyptians supported sex segregation in the workplace. Female genital mutilation was criminalized in Egypt in 2008. In 2012, UNICEF reported that 87% of Egyptian women and girls 15–49 years old had undergone female genital mutilation. In June 2013 13-year-old Soheir al-Batea died after undergoing FGM. The doctor responsible for the procedure became the first doctor in Egypt to be tried for committing female genital mutilation. On November 20, 2014 he was found not guilty. Virginity tests done by the military on detainees were banned in Egypt on 27 December 2011. The literacy rate of women (aged 15 and over) is 65.4%, which is lower than that of men which is 82.2% (data from 2015). Egypt is largely rural country, with only 43.1% of the population being urban (in 2015), and access to education is poor in rural areas. Most women in Egypt have adopted some form of veiling, with a majority of Egyptian women covering at least their hair with the hijab; however covering the face with a niqāb is only practiced by a minority of women (see Niqāb in Egypt). Families are usually of medium size, with the total fertility rate (TFR) being 3.53 children born/woman (2016 estimate). The contraception prevalence rate is high, at 60.3% (in 2008). In a 2013 poll of gender experts, Egypt ranked worst for women's rights out of all the Arab states. On 23 June 2020, Egyptian security forces detained prominent activist Sanaa Seif from outside the general prosecutor's office in the capital, Cairo, where she was waiting to file a complaint about being physically assaulted outside Cairo's Tora prison complex on 22 June 2020. =Violence against women= Sexual violence In a 2010 survey of 1,010 women by the Egyptian Center for Women's rights, 98% of foreign women and 83% of native women said they had been sexually harassed in Egypt and two-thirds of men said that they had harassed women. In 2013, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women reported that 99.3% of Egyptian women had experienced some form of harassment. Virginity tests done by the military on detainees were banned in Egypt on 27 December 2011. Human Rights Watch reported 91 sexual assaults in four days from 30 June 2013 during the Tahrir Square protests, as well as 19 cases of mob sexual assaults in January. The deputy Middle East director at HRW said that the attacks were \\"holding women back from participating fully in the public life of Egypt at a critical point in the country's development.\\" On 4 June 2013, a law criminalizing sexual harassment for the first time in modern Egyptian history was approved by then interim president, Adly Mansour. The 2014 Cairo hotel gang rape case in which a young woman was drugged and raped by a group of young men from wealthy families attracted wide social media and mainstream media attention, leading to the extradition of three of the accused men from Lebanon back to Egypt in September 2020. Egyptian Streets called the attention a #MeToo moment. Honor killings Honor killings take place in Egypt relatively frequently, due to reasons such as a woman meeting an unrelated man, even if this is only an allegation; or adultery (real or suspected).https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw- gp-2005/docs/experts/khafagy.honorcrimes.pdf Female genital mutilation Female genital mutilation (FGM) is widespread in Egypt, with a majority of women having undergone some version of the procedure,https://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGMC_2016_brochure_final_UNICEF_SPREAD.pdf although the practice is less common among the youth. The practice is deeply ingrained in the culture and predates both Christianity and Islam. Its main purpose is to preserve chastity, though its social function is very complicated. FGM was banned in 2008, but enforcement of the law was weak. In 2016, they tightened the law and made it a felony. Women continued to face inadequate protection from sexual and gender-based violence, as well as gender discrimination in law and practice, particularly under personal status laws regulating divorce. A 17-year-old girl died on 29 May, reportedly from hemorrhaging, following female genital mutilation (FGM) at a private hospital in Suez Governorate. Four people faced trial on charges of causing lethal injury and FGM, including the girl's mother and medical staff as per Amnesty 2016/2017 report. =Personal status laws= Inheritance Following an individuals death, Two-thirds of their estate is distributed according to compulsory inheritance rules, wherein Muslim women receive half the inheritance of what their brothers get. =Representation of women in politics= A constitutional referendum was held in Egypt in 2012. A constituent assembly was elected which drafted the new constitution. Of the 100 members of the assembly, only 7 were women. After the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état another constituent assembly was elected for a constitutional referendum in which 5 of the 50 members were women. In the 2015 Egyptian parliamentary election women won 75 of the 568 seats up for election. A further 14 women and 14 men were appointed by president Sisi. With a percentage of 14.9%, it was the highest representation of women in Egyptian parliament yet. Marriage and divorce Dreaming of marriage? Marriage was considered a very important part in ancient Egyptian society. Marriage was an almost completely private affair, and as a result, not many records of marriage were kept.paragraph 14 Johnson, Janet H. 2002. Women's Legal Rights in Ancient Egypt. (accessed April 12, 2009) Furthermore, not all Egyptian marriages were arranged, rather, most daughters had persuaded their families for their approval towards their future spouses. Egyptian women who were married were highly acknowledged. It was common for females to marry after the age of menstruation, such as age 14. They were usually considered married after they had left the protection of their father's house. It had also been acknowledged that though the woman became under her spouse's care, her husband did not become her legal guardian and the woman remained independent while controlling her own assets. For the non-royal women in ancient Egypt, the title of wife also came with the title \\"Mistress of the House\\". The role as a wife included taking care of the household. Egypt's laws pertaining to marriage and divorce have changed over the years, however they have generally favored the social position of men, although reform continues. Egypt retained the inclusion of Islamic law in dealings of family law, following on from its judicial and administrative independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1874.Esposito & DeLong-Bas, Women in Muslim Family Law, p47 Muslim husbands were traditionally allowed to have up to four wives at a time in accordance with Islamic religious custom, but a woman could have only one husband at a time. A Muslim man could divorce his wife with ease by saying \\"I divorce thee\\" on three separate occasions in the presence of witnesses. The first reforms that changed this state of affairs came in the 1920s with Law No.25 of 1920 and 1929. These reforms included the following specifics regarding legitimate grounds for a woman requesting a divorce: #If her husband failed to provide maintenance. (nafaqah) #If her husband was found to have a dangerous or contagious disease. #If she was deserted by her husband. #If she was maltreated by her husband.Esposito & DeLong-Bas, Women in Muslim Family Law, p51 In 1971 further reforms were made. Dr.Aisha Ratib became Minister of Social Affairs and in November the following revisions were suggested and implemented : #That the age for legal marriage should be raised to 18 for women and 21 for men #That the permission of a judge was required for polygamy #That divorces could not take place without a judge being present #That the mother should be allowed a greater period of guardianship, but also that guardianship in the case of divorce should go to the parent deemed most suitable to provide it #That judges should have more involvement in family law cases, and that female judges should be considered to deal with family law cases.Esposito & DeLong-Bas, Women in Muslim Family Law, p58 The government amended the laws relating to personal status in 1979. The amendments, which became known as the \\"women's rights law,\\" were in the form of a presidential decree and subsequently approved by the People's Assembly. The leading orthodox Islamic clergy endorsed these amendments, but Islamist groups opposed them as state infringements of religious precepts and campaigned for their repeal. The amendments stated that polygamy was legally harmful to a first wife and entitled her to sue for divorce within a year after learning of her husband's second marriage. The amendments also entitled the first wife to compensation. A husband retained the right to divorce his wife without recourse to the courts, but he was required to file for his divorce before witnesses at a registrar's office and officially and immediately to inform his wife. The divorced wife was entitled to alimony equivalent to one year's maintenance in addition to compensation equivalent to two years' maintenance; a court could increase these amounts under extenuating circumstances such as the dissolution of a long marriage. The divorced wife automatically retained custody of sons under the age of ten and daughters under twelve; courts could extend the mother's custody of minors until their eighteenth birthdays. Women during the 2011 Egyptian revolution In 1985 Egyptian authorities ruled that the amendments of 1979 were unconstitutional because they had been enacted through a presidential decree while the People's Assembly was not in session. A new law reversed many of the rights accorded to women in 1979. A woman lost her automatic right to divorce her husband if he married a second wife. She could still petition a court to consider her case, but a judge would grant a divorce only if it were in the interests of the family. If a divorce were granted, the judge would also determine what was an appropriate residence for the divorced woman and her children. The changes in divorce legislation in 1979 and 1985 did not significantly alter the divorce rate, which has been relatively high since the early 1950s. About one in five marriages ended in divorce in the 1980s. Remarriage was common, and most divorced men and women expected to wed again. Seven out of ten divorces took place within the first five years of marriage, and one out of three in the first year. The divorce rate depended on residence and level of education. The highest divorce rates were among the urban lower class, the lowest rates among the villagers of Upper Egypt. Throughout the country, as much as 95 percent of all divorces occurred among couples who were illiterate. Marital rape is not specifically outlawed in Egypt.

The winery is located in the Right Bank of France's Bordeaux wine region in the commune of Saint-Émilion, in the department Gironde. The estate also produces the second wine Côte Mignon La Gaffelière, and is closely involved with the production of the \\"Vin de garage\\" La Mondotte. History Although an old property with viticultural history dating back to the 17th century when the Comte de Malets-Roqueforts bought extensive real-estate, including the site of a leper colony, and rented out large parts to sharecroppers. This vineyard came to prominence when Boitard de la Poterie family bought and cultivated what became known as Canon-Boitard, while the remaining land retained by the Malets-Roqueforts would become Château La Gaffelière. Both the estates apply the word gaffet, which translates to leper. In 1971 the estate was bought by count Joseph-Hubert von Neipperg, and in 1985 passed control to his son count Stephan von Neipperg, the current proprietor. Accredited with much of the success of the estate, his other properties include Clos de l'Oratoire and the \\"super-cuvée\\" La Mondotte. Having once been an exponent of modern techniques in winemaking, including microoxygenation,winepros.com.au. von Neipperg has become critical of his own earlier vintages. Since the early 2000s he has reverted Canon-la-Gaffelière to a style of moderation aiming at a truer expression of wine, and is quoted saying \\"I don't make plum pudding\\". The estate's consultant is the self-taught oenologist Stéphane Derenoncourt. Production The vineyard area extends 19.5 hectares with the grape varieties of 55% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. Of the Grand vin, Château Canon-la-Gaffelière there is a total annual production of 7,500 cases, in addition to the production of the second wine, Côte Mignon La Gaffelière. La Mondotte From a small plot of limestone near Château Pavie-Macquin, originally purchased by Joseph-Hubert von Neipperg in 1971 when it was named Château La Mondotte, the terroir initially produced crops that struggled to ripen and did not meet expectations. Using the most modern techniques, the word \\"château\\" was omitted to emphasise a new start, and that the little house on the property is hardly a château, La Mondotte was launched with the 1996 vintage. With its extreme characteristics, it is alternately referred to as a \\"super-cuvée\\" or a \\"garage wine\\", and has become one of the most expensive wines of Bordeaux. From a vineyard area of 4.5 hectares composed of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc, the estate has an annual production of 650 to 1,000 cases a year. As well as Canon la Gaffelière, La Mondotte has also been promoted a Premier Grand cru classé estate with the Saint-Émilion reclassification in 2012.

Their social roles and opportunities have changed since the time of French colonialism. From independence in 1960, women's status under the law was inferior to that of men, and this continued until the 1990s. The legal changes following President's Félix Houphouët-Boigny death brought improvement in legal and educational opportunities for women at all levels, and women have been moving into the highest levels of business and government. Cultural traditions and practices, too, have usually marked women for inferior status. While adherence to traditional roles persists, this continuity—as well as the traditions themselves—vary greatly with place and social context. Ivory Coast has more than 60 ethnic groups, usually classified into five principal divisions: Akan (east and center, including the \\"Lagoon peoples\\" of the southeast), Krou (southwest), Mandé (Mandé west and Mandé northwest groups), and Senufo-Lobi (north center and northeast). Each of these groups has its own traditional roles for women, as do the religions practised in the country (Christian 20–30 percent, Muslim 15–20 percent, indigenous 35–50 percent). Today's northern Ivory Coast was at the periphery of the Mali Empire and the great medieval states of the Sahel, while with Portuguese (from the 1460s) and later French colonial expansion, women of the southern regions experienced wars of colonialism and resistance firsthand. In the 1970s, Ivory Coast was considered the economic leader of West Africa, but since the 1990s, poverty and conflict have increased, at times affecting women disproportionately. The interplay of all these experiences has transformed the social roles of women in Ivorian society. The main issue of gender equality in Ivory Coast is the education. According to CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in Ivory Coast in total is 43.1%. 53.1% of males can read and write and only 32.5% of females can read and write. This shows that more than half of men can read, and less than half of women can read. It also states that the school life expectancy for males is ten years, whereas for girls it’s eight years. So far, no specific organizations have helped women education in Ivory Coast. However, many organizations have helped education for women in Africa as a whole, such as Africa Education Trust and Aid for Africa. In order for women’s education to be as equal as the men’s in Ivory Coast, the government must provide more schools for free, so that the people don’t think about financial issues once they put their child at school, and so the parents can afford to put both their sons and daughters in school. Education is free in Ivory Coast, but the parents must provide the school supplies, which might be a challenge if they have more than one child (Our Africa). This might lessen the need for women to go to school. For this to happen, the people must inform the government and if they refuse, protest. Education is a basic right everyone should afford, no matter the gender. By making education supplies free, it takes one more weight off of the adult’s shoulders. This would ensure that more women will have an education. By doing this, the child labor would lessen, but at least they’ll have a good education and in the future, they’re more likely to have a job. This will make the citizens of Africa’s lives much easier in terms of finances and education. Women's roles on the eve of colonialism Ethnic and cultural groups defined women's status in different ways on the eve of colonialism, with beliefs about the role of women in society partly the result of specific ethnic background and historical circumstance. It has been argued that Ivorian cultures largely had a cultural bias against equality between the sexes, embodied in customary law and codified in the colonial period. But this view has been challenged by Ivorian writers, who argue that in many pre-colonial societies, women held political and /or economic power equal to many men.N'Dri Thérèse Assié-Lumumba. Les Africaines dans la politique : femmes baoulé de Côte-d'Ivoire. Paris, L'Harmattan (1996). See review at Pounthioun M. D. Diallo, Assié-Lumumba, N'Dri Thérèse. -- Les Africaines dans la politique : femmes baoulé de Côte-d'Ivoire. Paris, L'Harmattan, 1996, 206 pp. (« Points de vue »)., Cahiers d'études africaines, 160, 2000 Looking specifically at the N'Gongbo Baoulé people, one writer contrasts Ivorian women's roles the traditional Western tradition where the public and the private spheres are separated, with the superior public sphere reserved for men, and argues that Western intellectuals transpose this model onto \\"traditional\\" societies in Africa. Rather, the African experience is said to be characterized by coexistence of parallel positions, overlapping roles, and cross gender cooperation. Amongst the Mossi peoples, women's inheritance of family land and possessions, while uncommon, is possible. Women of the Dyoula Mande peoples, living traditionally in scattered communities across in long-distance trade communities, were often powerful merchants in their own right. The Gio or Dan people of the southwest regard domestic duties as the preserve of women, while many Mandinka women engage in farming and trade. Women in bond labor communities, or those in cultures with strong caste systems found themselves doubly discriminated against. From the 12th century, but progressing more deeply into the north of Ivory Coast from the 16th century, Islam defined the status of women in Muslim communities. Polygamy, practised among most Mande peoples since pre-Islamic days, was codified under Islam, which offered both protections and disadvantages. In Mande Muslim communities, the first wife has authority over any subsequent wives, sharing domestic work, and caring for the extended family, into which the wives' parents may be folded into the husbands family. Finally, the African slave trade, beginning in the 15th century destroyed whole communities, with women killed in slave raiding and associated warfare and those enslaved separated from families, and transported to the Americas (or to neighboring states) in brutal conditions. The beginning of the direct colonial period in the 19th century brought general dislocation, warfare, and large population movements, especially in the southern forest zones of West Africa, as the French moved in from the West and South in the 1860s–90s. Under French colonialism =Colonial law and women= Role expectations for women were altered somewhat by colonial legislation, which liberated captives throughout francophone Africa in 1903, and then by the Mandel Decree of 1939, which fixed the minimum age of marriage at fourteen and made mutual consent a formal necessity for marriage. These decrees, while promulgated by colonial officials, affected rural areas only fleetingly. Bonded and caste communities remained in serfdom like conditions until at least the World War I period, when a series of population movements and communal resistance changed many of these dependence relationships. Wars during the early colonial period caused an increase in slave taking, in which women were separated from men and moved into new communities.see Martin Klein. Slavery and Colonial Rule in French West Africa. Cambridge University Press (1998) : pp. 132–37, 208–209, 237–240. As the title indicates, Klein is concerned with the persistence of African slavery under French rule. He argues that customary law and French appointed chiefs allowed formal slavery to continue in some areas up to the 1920s, and the social relationship to survive through independence. The Jacquinot Decree of 1951 invoked the power of the state to protect women from claims to their services—by their own or their husband's family—after marriage, and enabled women to obtain a divorce more easily and invalidated in-laws' claims to any bride-price that had been paid to a woman's family to legitimize the marriage. This decree also recognized monogamy as the only legal form of marriage and allowed couples to marry without parental consent. Small numbers of girls were offered primary education by the French government (in urban areas), while Catholic missions, offered education to others, especially in the south.Virginia Thompson, Richard Adloff. French West Africa. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press. (1958) pp. 527–28, 580–82 At the same time, almost the entire population of the colony were colonial Subjects, ruled under the French Code de l'Indigénat. In practice, this meant that women, like men, were ruled by decrees from a handful of French Cercle Commanders, who administered with little oversight, and carried out policies through a series of French appointed \\"Canton chiefs\\". \\"Customary\\" law, outside Muslim areas, was usually rule decided by appointed chiefs and their officials, while only whites and a tiny number of educated African men were subject to French courts. Whatever decrees issued at the colonial capital in Dakar were implemented at the discretion of local commanders, who usually preferred to leave social concerns to chiefs.Jean Suret-Canele. French Colonialism in Tropical Africa 1900–1945. Trans. Pica Press (1971) =Colonial dislocation= Women were especially affected by three colonial practices that increased in the early 20th century: forced labor, taxation, and military draft. All of French West Africa was subject to periodic forced labor campaigns, which peaked in the 1930s, and declined thereafter. Ivory Coast was unique, though, in that the north of the colony had white run cotton plantations, for which locals were pressed into service when migrant labor (mostly from modern Burkina Faso) was unavailable. Unlike road building or other forced labor projects, for which men were called up for a period ranging from days to months, men (and some women) were pressed into cotton work for years at a time. While only a small number of women were drafted into French labor schemes, the process of taking men out of their communities for long periods of time meant that women were forced to provide for their communities.Jean Suret-Canele. op sit, pp. 233, 247–48, 253–256.

Men who survived these experiences came home less likely to accept the strictures of colonial or customary rule, and while they were away, women were forced to provide for, and sometimes lead, communities.Myron Echenberg, Colonial Conscripts: The Tirailleurs Senegalais in French West Africa, 1857–1960. Heinemann (1990), Nancy Ellen Lawler. Soldiers of Misfortune: Ivorien Tirailleurs of World War II. Ohio Univ Press (1992) =Independence struggle= The political struggle for independence after the Second World War was organized around the Rassemblement Démocratique Africain (RDA), whose Ivorian section was led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. After his break with the French Communist Party in 1950, under pressure from the French administration, many of the socially progressive planks of the RDA platform were dropped, and once in power, many legal advantages given to women (in law alone) were reversed. Women played little role in the formal leadership of the RDA, yet women were crucial in demanding independence from France. At the grassroots, women played an active role in the independence struggle across French West Africa. One dramatic example occurred in 1949, when protests by local women in Grand Bassam and Abidjan caused the administration to back down from the detention of RDA leaders, and help spread support for the party at a time in which it was facing severe repression.Thompson and Aldoff, pp. 128–29. Post- Independence At independence, the government of President Félix Houphouët- Boigny acknowledged existing decrees affecting the status of women and went on to establish the primacy of the nuclear family, raise the minimum age for marriage to eighteen, and condemn in general terms the notion of female inferiority. At the same time, however, legislation during the 1960s established a husband's right to control much of his wife's property, and it required a woman to obtain her husband's permission to establish a bank account or obtain a job. The government also placed restrictions on a woman's right to divorce, denied legal recognition of matrilineal rights of inheritance (inheritance by a man's nephews before his sons), and finally, condemned the practice of bride-price. Houphouët-Boigny's political style and longevity shaped Ivorian elites into a wealthy, male, educated social stratum. By the late 1980s, women were beginning to emerge within this group, as education and acculturation enabled them to challenge the established order. Official attitudes toward the status of women were pragmatic, like most official attitudes in Ivory Coast. In 1963 women reacted to the extent and direction of government control by forming the Association of Ivoirian Women (Association des Femmes Ivoiriennes—AFI). They also persuaded the president to establish the Ministry of Women's Affairs (Ministère de la Condition Féminine, later the Ministre de la solidarité et de la Promotion de la Femme) in 1976 and to appoint AFI leader Jeanne Gervais as minister. Gervais's goals were to obtain better educational and employment opportunities for women and to establish judicial equality for women. Legislation was enacted in 1983 to allow a woman to control some of her property after marriage and to appeal to the courts for redress of a husband's actions. Civil War Women were greatly affected by the Ivorian Civil War, begun in September 2002, but coming on the heels of a decade of internal conflict. The growth of the concept of Ivoirité, a 1990s nationalist movement which sought to exclude large portions of the population from \\"true\\" citizenship, was both championed by and caused the suffering of women. Changes in nationality law meant that women married to Ivorian born men no longer considered citizens lost their citizenship as well.Marie-Natalie LeBlanc. “Between Foreigners and Citizens: The Negotiation of Political Agency by Elder Malian Women in Côte d'Ivoire”, American Association of Anthropology, (AAA) Annual Meeting, Chicago, US, November, 1999 On the other side, some women leaders were prominent exponents of Ivoirité, most notably Simone Gbagbo, the wife of the president.L'influence de Simone Gbagbo. 12 December 2006. by \\"SOURCE J.A.\\", Soir Info. Once the war broke out into open conflict in 2002, women formed 52 percent of the estimated 700,000 Internally displaced persons during the war, while rape and sexual violence were widespread, especially in the north and west of the country. Both rebel and government forces have been accused of systemic sexual violence towards women as a tactic to terrorise populations suspected of opposition to their forces. Women suffering the effects of such violence are often shunned, while customary law offers few remedies, and the formal court system has largely failed to prosecute perpetrators. Women have found themselves forced into prostitution in the wake of economic collapse in war-torn areas.Focus on Women in Côte d’Ivoire.

The status of women, in practice and in the law, was still well below that of men through most of the 1980s, but educational opportunities for women were improving at all levels. In 1987 about one-sixth of the students at the National University of Ivory Coast were women, and the number of women in the salaried workforce had also increased. Women made up almost one-fourth of the civil service and held positions previously closed to them, in medicine, law, business, and university teaching. =Politics= While prominent women take leadership roles in politics, their numbers are minimal. The first female parliamentarian was elected in 1965, and only 5.7 percent of parliamentary seats were held by women in 1990, and 8.5 percent in 2005.

While maternal mortality and fertility rates are declining, they are far above those of developed countries. Child mortality has in fact increased since 1990, with 101.3 children of every 1000 live birth dying before age five in 2005, an increase from 97.2 in 1990. 43.5 percent of women are married by the age of 18 (median: 19.8 for women, 27.6 for men), while the median age at first sexual intercourse for women is 16.1 years. 115.6 per 1000 women age 15–20 have given birth. Only 53 percent of women 15–24 know that condom use can protect them from HIV.UNFPA 2005. There are stark disparities in women's lives in rural areas versus urban areas. Women in rural communities are more likely to be married younger, give birth, and see children die in their first five years than urban women. In rural areas 41 percent women between the age of 15–19 will give birth to their first child, with on 32.1 percent aided by a skilled attendant, in contrast to 18.9 percent of urban women of this age group giving birth, and 79.1 percent with birthing aid. =Literacy= Boys and girls head to school in a northern town. Illiteracy rates for females, while still well above males, have dropped since 1990.

Females between 15 and 24 saw their illiteracy rate drop from 60 percent to 41 percent in this period (35 percent to 26 percent for males). School enrolment for girls still lags boys, with 68 percent of primary school aged and 17 percent of secondary school aged girls enrolled (89 percent and 30 percent for boys). The poorest children of both sexes are less likely to receive schooling, yet even in the top wealth quintile only 70.7 percent of girls aged 6–10 attend school (82.9 percent for boys).

Society under the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya The roles and status of women had then become the subject of a great deal of discussion and legal action in Libya after the change of rule, as they have in many countries of the Middle East. Some observers suggested that the regime made efforts on behalf of female emancipation because it viewed women as an essential source of labour in an economy chronically starved for workers. They also postulated that the government was interested in expanding its political base, hoping to curry favour by championing female rights. Since independence, Libyan leaders have been committed to improving the condition of women. Central to the revolution of 1969 was the empowerment of women and removal of inferior status. =Emancipation= In the 1970s, female emancipation was in large measure a matter of age. One observer generalized that city women under the age of thirty-five had discarded the traditional veil and were quite likely to wear Western-style clothing. Those between the ages of thirty-five and forty-five were increasingly ready to consider such a change, but women over the age of forty-five appeared reluctant to give up the protection which they perceived their veils and customary dress to afford. A decade later, veiling was uncommon among urban women. During this era, women were also increasingly seen driving, shopping, or travelling without husbands or male companions (known as Mahrams). Voting and government Since 1964, Libyan women have had the right to vote and to participate in political life. They could also own and dispose of property independently of their husbands, but all of these rights were exercised by only a few women before the 1969 revolution. Since then, the government has encouraged women to participate in elections and national political institutions, but in 1987 only one woman had advanced as far as the national cabinet, as an assistant secretary for information and culture. However, from 1989 to 1994 Fatima Abd al-Hafiz Mukhtar served as Minister of Education. Salma Ahmed Rashed, from 1992 to 1994, served as Assistant Secretary of Women, then as Secretary in the General Secretariat of the General People's Congress for Women's Affairs from 1994 to 1995, and was eventually the Ambassador to the League of Arab Nations in 1996. Others serving as Secretary in the General Secretariat of the General People's Congress for Women's Affairs included from 1995 to 1998 Thuriya Ramadan Abu Tabrika, Nura Han Ramadan Abu Sefrian from 1998 to 2000, Dr. Shalma Chabone Abduljabbar, and Amal Nuri Abdullah al-Safar from 2006 to 2009. Women serving as Secretary in the General Secretariat of the General People's Congress for Social Affairs have included Dr. Shalma Chabone Abduljabbar and Abd-al-Alim al-Shalwi, while from 1995 to 2000 Fawziya Bashir al-Shalababi served as Secretary for Information, Culture and Mass Mobilization. Dr. Huda Fathi Ben Amer began serving as the Secretary of People's Committees Affairs in 2009, and also served as President of the Transitional Arab Parliament.\\"Fifth meeting of women Speakers of Parliament\\", The World of Parliaments.

Accessed June 9, 2011 Association Women were also able to form their own associations. The first associated was in 1955 in Benghazi. In 1970, several feminist organizations merged into the Women's General Union which in 1977 became the Jamahiriya Women's Federation. Under Clause 5 of the Constitutional Proclamation of December 11, 1969, women had already been given equal status under the law with men. Subsequently, the women's movement has been active in such fields as adult education and hygiene. Employment Women had also made great gains in employment outside the home, the result of improved access to education and of increased acceptance of female paid employment. Once again, the government was the primary motivating force behind this phenomenon. For example, the 1976–80 development plan called for employment of a larger number of women \\"in those spheres which are suitable for female labour\\", but the Libyan identification of what work was suitable for women continued to be limited by tradition. According to the 1973 census, the participation rate for women (the percent of all women engaged in economic activity) was about 3 percent as compared with 37 percent for men. The participation was somewhat higher than the 2.7 percent registered in 1964, but it was considerably lower than that in other Maghrib countries and in most of the Middle Eastern Arab states. In the 1980s, in spite of the gain registered by women during the prior decade, females constituted only 7 percent of the national labour force, according to one informed researcher. This represented a 2 percent increase over a 20-year period. Another source, however, considered these figures far too low. Reasoning from 1973 census figures and making allowances for full- and part-time, seasonal, paid, and unpaid employment, these researchers argued convincingly that women formed more than 20 percent of the total economically active Libyan population. For rural areas their figure was 46 percent, far higher than official census numbers for workers who in most cases were not only unpaid but not even considered as employed. Among non-agricultural women, those who were educated and skilled were overwhelmingly employed as teachers. The next highest category of educated and skilled women ware nurses and those found in the health care field. Others areas that were open to women included administrative and clerical work in banks, department stores, and government offices and domestic services. Women were found in ever larger numbers as nurses and midwives, but even so, Libyan health care facilities suffered from a chronic shortage of staff. By contrast, in clerical and secretarial jobs, the problem was not a shortage of labour but a deep-seated cultural bias against the intermingling of men and women in the workplace. During the 1970s, the attraction of employment as domestics tended to decline, as educated and ambitious women turned to more lucrative occupations. To fill the gap, Libyan households sought to hire foreigners, particularly Egyptians and Tunisians. Light industry, especially cottage-style, was yet another outlet for female labour, a direct result of Libya's labour shortage. Despite these employment outlets and gains, female participation in the work force of the 1980s remained small, and many socially female jobs were filled by foreign women. Also, in spite of significant increases in female enrollments in the educational system, including university level, few women were found, even as technicians, in such traditionally male fields as medicine, engineering, and law. Non-urban women constituted a quite significant, if largely invisible, proportion of the rural work force. According to the 1973 census, there were only l4, 000 economically active women out of a total of 200,000 rural females older than age 10. In all likelihood, however, many women engaged in agricultural or domestic tasks worked as unpaid members of family groups and hence were not regarded as gainfully employed, accounting to at least in part for the low census count. Estimates of actual female rural employment in the mid 1970s, paid and unpaid ranged upward of 86,000, as compared with 96,000 men in the rural work force. In addition to agriculture, both rural and nomadic women engaged in the weaving of rugs and carpets, another sizable category of unpaid and unreported labor. Beginning in 1970, the revolutionary government passed a series of laws regulating female employment - equal pay for equal work and qualifications became a fundamental precept. Other statutes strictly regulate the hours and conditions of work, specifically the prohibition of hard labor, and 48 hours. =Childcare and retirement benefits= Working mothers enjoyed a range of benefits designed to encourage them to continue working even after marriage and childbirth, including cash bonuses for the first child and free day care centres.

Marshall Cavendish, 2004. , . p. 73, 76, 78 Culture By the 1980s relations within the family and between the sexes, along with all other aspects of Libyan life, had begun to show notable change. As the mass media popularized new ideas, new perceptions and practices appeared. Foreign settlers and foreign workers frequently embodied ideas and values distinctively different from those traditional in the country. In particular, the perceptions of Libyans in everyday contact with Europeans were affected. The continued and accelerating process of urbanization had broken old kinship ties and association with ancestral rural communities. At the same time, opportunities for upward social movement have increased, and petroleum wealth and the development plans of the revolutionary government have made many new kinds of employment available thus opening up more well paid jobs for women especially among the educated young. Many of these educated and increasingly independent young women preferred to set up their own households at marriage, rather than live with their in-laws. In addition social security, free medical care, education, and other appurtenances of the welfare state had lessened the dependence of the aged on their children in village communities and had almost eliminated it in the cities. Military As of the late 20th century the regime had sought to introduce women into the armed forces. In the 1978 Libya's new military academy began training women, training thousands since. In the early 1980s where the 'Nuns of the Revolution' were created as a specialist police force attached to revolutionary committees. Then in 1984, a law mandating female conscription that required all students in secondary schools and above to participate in military training was passed. In addition, young women were encouraged to attend female military academies, the first of which was established in 1979. These proposals originated with Colonel Gaddafi, who hoped that they would help create a new image and role for Libyan women everywhere. Nonetheless, the concept of female training in the martial arts encountered such widespread opposition that meaningful compliance seemed unlikely. Marriage Child brides were banned, and the minimum legal age to marry placed at 18.\\"God has ninety-nine names: reporting from a militant Middle East\\", Judith Miller.

Thirty-three women have been elected to serve in Libya's General National Congress in the first free elections since the NATO-backed revolt deposed during which Muammar Gaddafi was killed. However, \\"the ways in which the New Libyan state chooses to appropriate or obliterate the remnants of Gadaffi’s gender regime remains to be seen.\\" Likewise, NGOs have emerged that are fighting for the rights of women by improving their education and training.

Governing body The Cuban Rugby Union is the governing body for rugby union in the Cuba. It was founded in 1996. History Che Guevara (first on the right) with an Argentine rugby team, c. 1948. Rugby was played by famous Argentinian revolutionaries Alberto Granado and Che Guevara. After meeting through the game and going on to tour South America (see The Motorcycle Diaries) the pair would settle in Cuba and become national heroes. Alberto Granado later became Cuban's Rugby first Patron and helped develop the sport in the Country where it had not been traditionally played. During the 1990s and first decade of this century Rugby slowly developed with the involvement of several touring teams from foreign countries such as Canada and France. These teams helped to provide both coaching and much needed equipment. With no olympic support at this time, Cuban rugby had no financial backing from the government with teams often playing under precarious conditions with no changing rooms, goal posts and even no markings on the pitch. In 2002 the Cuban Rugby Union organized the Cuban Rugby Championship for the first time, with both a 15 a side and sevens tournament. =First IRB Sanctioned Tournament= In 2010 Havana hosted an 8-team International Rugby Sevens tournament, the first IRB sanctioned tournament to be performed in the country. The tournament was a big success, receiving coverage from the national press—introducing many Cubans to the sport who previously knew nothing of the game. The Cuban national team beat Mexico, showing a big improvement in playing standards on the Island but then lost to a US select side named Atlantis 0-15. The tournament also featured 3 Cuban development sides. As of 2010 Cuban rugby is still lacking financial backing despite rugby sevens recently being given Olympic status. It is hoped this will change in the future. In 2016 the first multi-team veterans (over 35s) rugby tournament was played in Cuba. The Copa de Amistad (Friendship Cup) was organised by a small group of Australians led by Rowan Ward, and assisted by Cuban 'rugbyistas' Osmel Hernandez and Leonid Baro, who the Australians had met and befriended in earlier trips to the Caribbean island. Played over 6 days 29 Oct to 4 Nov 2016 the tournament was a big success, with 8 teams participating from Cuba, Australia, USA (California and Colorado), Canada, Chile and Israel. There was also a barbarians team with strong representation from Argentina. The presence of the Israeli team, the Elders of Zion, was reportedly the first sporting team from Israel to tour Cuba in over 50 years. The tournament raised over US$10,000 in funds and materials supporting Cuban youth rugby, a project for adolescents with Downs Syndrome in Havana (Petalos de Amor) and the introduction of a science-based sustainable development course in universities in central Cuba.

It is native to southern Africa, where it can be found in Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Namibia, and South Africa. U. bisquamata grows as a terrestrial plant in damp, sandy or peaty soils among mosses by streams or wet depressions at altitudes from near sea level to in South Africa and up to in Angola. It was originally described and published by Franz Paula von Schrank in 1824.Taylor, Peter. (1989). The genus Utricularia - a taxonomic monograph. Kew Bulletin Additional Series XIV: London. Description Utricularia bisquamata is a small annual herb growing to a height of about . It has a rosette of narrow leaves and wiry stems supporting racemes of flowers with two lips, white, pale violet or occasionally yellow. The upper lip is small with two or three lobes and the lower lip has two short lobes a\\\\t the side and acentral lobe. The base of the lower lip has a patch of yellow which is variable in size . The traps, translucent, are developed in the roots. Distribution and habitat Utricularia bisquamata is native to southern Africa where it occurs in Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho and Madagascar, and forms part of the fynbos community. The typical habitat of this species is acidic, boggy soils in sandstone areas where it grows among mosses in wet places. In cultivation Although sometimes found in cultivation and germinating freely from seed, U. bisquamata is a relatively dull species of carnivorous plant with small flowers, except for the cultivar \\"Betty's Bay\\" which has a larger, more colourful flower.  Synonyms  U. arenaria is an extremely variable species, which accounts for the amount of synonymy. *Antirrhinum aphyllum L.f. *Bucranion capense (Spreng.) Raf. *Calpidisca capensis (Spreng.)

A major force for change has been the rapid influx of women into the many jobs created in the 1980s in the export processing zones. Although low-paying for the most part, the jobs allow women formerly confined to the roles of mother and wife to gain a certain degree of personal and social freedom. One woman, in a 1993 National Geographic article, said: \\"For a Mauritian woman, to work is to be free. Before, a girl could not leave home until her parents found a husband for her, and then she moved into her husband's family's home and spent the rest of her life having babies. I met my husband at work, and it was my decision to marry him. Now we live in our own house.\\" The government has taken measures to promote equality of the sexes by repealing discriminatory laws dealing with inheritance and emigration. In 1989 the government appointed equal opportunity officers in the principal ministries to deal with women's issues. Reports by the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family Welfare and others indicate, however, that violence against women is prevalent. The increased employment of women has created the need for more child-care services and for more laborsaving devices in the home. In 2016, the Ministry of Gender Equality requested the withdrawal of an advertisement by Coca-Cola which was considered \\"sexist\\" following a complaint from a gender consultant. Today, women in Mauritius are more independent than they used to be some 30 years ago. Mauritius also has got its first Lady President, Mrs Ameena Gurib-Fakhim and the first Lady Speaker, Hon.Mrs Maya Hanoomanjee, in 2014. The proportion of students progressing from primary cycle to secondary cycle in 2011 was 79% for boys and 84% for girls. Girls are outperforming boys at higher school level. The proportion of women in the most senior positions (Senior Chief Executive, Permanent Secretary, Deputy Permanent Secretary, Director, Manager, Judge and Magistrate) increased from 23% in 2001 to 40% in 2016. http://defimedia.info/pub-de-coca-cola-le- ministere-de-legalite-des-genres-fait-marche-arriere References (Data as of 1994.)

Women's role is primarily understood as mothers, sisters, daughters and wives. Additionally, women's roles are in accordance with ethnic differences and religious background, with women in Northern Nigeria being more likely to be secluded in the home, than women in Southern Nigeria, who participate more in public life. Modern challenges for the women of Nigeria include child marriagehttps://www.girlsnotbrides.org/child-marriage/nigeria/ and female genital mutilation.  Social issues  = Child marriage = Child marriage is common in Nigeria, with 43% of girls being married before their 18th birthday, and 17% before they turn 15. The prevalence, however, varies greatly by region. Nigeria's total fertility rate is 5.07 children/woman.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html Nigeria's high fertility rate is causing socio-economic problems and fueling under- development.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/nigeria-high-fertility-rate- fueling-underdevelopment- experts/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/world/africa/in-nigeria-a-preview- of-an-overcrowded-planet.html  Education  = Female genital mutilation = Female genital cutting (also known as female genital mutilation) in Nigeria accounts for the most female genital cutting/mutilation (FGM/C) cases worldwide. The practice is considered harmful to girls and women and a violation of human rights. FGM causes infertility, maternal death, infections, and the loss of sexual pleasure. Nationally, 27% of Nigerian women between the ages of 15 and 49 were victims of FGM, as of 2012. In the last 30 years, prevalence of the practice has decreased by half in some parts of Nigeria. It was reported that about one fourth of Nigerian women reported having ever experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) as of 2013. Studies carried on the prevalence of IPV in four Geo-political zones of Nigeria indicated that South East had 78.8%, North had 42%, South South had 41%,Dienye P, Gbeneol P, Itimi K.

All twelve states are governed by Islamic Sharia Law. The States, which are all northern, include the states of Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara which allows for a man to take more than one wife. Elsewhere, both Christians and traditionalists in polygamous unions are recognized by customary law. These unions are contingent upon the absence of prior civil marriage, as bigamy technically applies, but even when present, men are seldom ever prosecuted for bigamy in Nigeria. = Prostitution = = Women's education = = Women's advocacy = A national feminist movement was inaugurated in 1982,Madunagu, Bene E. \\"The Nigerian Feminist Movement: Lessons from \\"Women in Nigeria\\", WIN.\\" Review of African Political Economy 35, no. 118 (2008): 666-72. Accessed May 25, 2020. www.jstor.org/stable/20406565. and a national conference held at Ahmadu Bello University. The papers presented there indicated a growing awareness by Nigeria's university-educated women that the place of women in society required a concerted effort and a place on the national agenda; the public perception, however, remained far behind. For example, a feminist meeting in Ibadan came out against polygamy and then was soundly criticized by market women, who said they supported the practice because it allowed them to pursue their trading activities and have the household looked after at the same time. Research in the north indicated that many women opposed the practice, and tried to keep bearing children to stave off a second wife's entry into the household. Although women's status would undoubtedly rise, for the foreseeable future Nigerian women lacked the opportunities of men. Yinka Jegede-Ekpe, herself HIV-positive, set up the Nigerian Community of Women Living With HIV/AIDS in 2001. The group intended to inform women about the risks of HIV/AIDS and to empower them to speak out.  Regional differences  = Northern Nigeria = In the north, practices that were introduced in terms of women's position in society have been mainly as a result of colonialism and the introduction of salafism and wahhabism thought into the traditionally sufistregion . This process has meant, generally, less formal education; early teenage marriages, especially in rural areas; and confinement to the household, which was often polygynous, except for visits to family, ceremonies, and the workplace, if employment were available and permitted by a girl's family or husband. For the most part, Hausa women did not work in the fields, whereas Kanuri women did; both helped with harvesting and were responsible for all household food processing. Urban women sold cooked foods, usually by sending young girls out onto the streets or operating small stands. Research indicated that this practice was one of the main reasons city women gave for opposing schooling for their daughters. Even in elite houses with educated wives, women's presence at social gatherings was either nonexistent or very restricted. In the modern sector, a few women were appearing at all levels in offices, banks, social services, nursing, radio, television, and the professions (teaching, engineering, environmental design, law, pharmacy, medicine, and even agriculture and veterinary medicine). This trend resulted from women's secondary schools, teachers' colleges, and in the 1980s women holding approximately one-fifth of university places—double the proportion of the 1970s. Research in the 1980s indicated that, for the Muslim north, education beyond primary school was restricted to the daughters of the business and professional elites, and in almost all cases, courses and professions were chosen by the family, not the woman themselves. However, in the last few years, the rate of women's employment has apparently increased as more women have been employed in the modern sector. You find them as cashiers in the banks, teachers in public and private primary and secondary schools, nurses at hospitals as well as television hosts of different TV programs. Although, the issue of women not occupying top positions still remains a huge challenge all over the country and across all sectors as most of these positions are occupied by men with little opportunities for equally qualified women. In addition, young ladies deciding on courses and professions to choose from now have the full autonomy to do that in some households especially in the southern part of the country. However, the north still lags behind in these apparent changes due to cultural laws. = Southern Nigeria = A Nigerian woman balancing market goods on her head In the south, women traditionally had economically important positions in interregional trade and the markets, worked on farms as major labour sources, and had influential positions in traditional systems of local organization. The south, like the north, had been polygynous; in 1990 it still was for many households, including those professing Christianity. Women in the south, had received Western-style education since the nineteenth century, so they occupied positions in the professions and to some extent in politics. In addition, women headed households, something not seriously considered in Nigeria's development plans. Such households were more numerous in the south, but they were on the rise everywhere.  Recognition by authorities  Generally, in Nigeria, development planning refers to \\"adult males,\\" \\"households,\\" or \\"families\\". Women were included in such units but not as a separate category. Up until the 1980s, the term \\"farmer\\" was assumed to be exclusively male, even though in some areas of the nation women did most of the farm work. In Nigerian terms, a woman was almost always defined as someone's daughter, wife, mother, or widow. Single women were suspect, although they constituted a large category, especially in the cities, because of the high divorce rate. Traditionally, and to some extent this remained true in popular culture, single adult women were seen as available sexual partners should they try for some independence and as easy victims for economic exploitation. In Kaduna State, for example, investigations into illegal land expropriations noted that women's farms were confiscated almost unthinkingly by local chiefs wishing to sell to urban-based speculators and would-be commercial farmers.

The five ships in the class were originally used in ferry service around the Black Sea. During the 1980s all ships in the class were rebuilt into cruise ships. During the end of the 1990s all ships in the class were sold to other operators. As of 2008, at least four ships in this class were in service. The effects of the new SOLAS regulations that came into effect in 2010 remain unknown. Concept and construction During the early 1970s, the Black Sea Shipping Company of the Soviet Union decided to order five cruiseferries to be used on domestic traffic around the Black Sea. Instead of having the ships built domestically or ordering them from Comecon member states, the new ships were ordered from the Wärtsilä shipyards in neutral Finland. The Belorussiya class ships were built to the same standards of technology and passenger comfort as the cruiseferries built in the western world at the time. They were also amongst the largest cruiseferries of their time, surpassing the largest cruiseferries built in the west at the same time ( and ) in terms of gross register tonnage. When the Belorussiya class ships entered service, it soon turned out their car-carrying capacity was too small in comparison with their passenger-carrying capacity. Due to their high standards of passenger accommodation, it was decided that instead of rebuildings the ships with larger car-decks, they would be converted into cruise ships with minimal car-carrying facilities. Between 1981 and 1988 all ships in the class were rebuilt at West German or British shipyards,Miller (1995). p. 56. with the car decks built in with cabins and additional public spaces, and the forward superstructure slightly expanded. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the sale of the Belorussiya class ships to different operators around the world, some of the ships have received further rebuildings. Service history During their career under the Soviet flag, the Belorussiya class ships were used on domestic traffic between Crimea and the Caucasus, as well as considerable cruising both for Soviet passengers as well as under charter to travel companies outside the Eastern Bloc. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ships were initially transferred under Ukrainian flag,Miller (1995). pp. 14, 20, 56, 63-64. then towards the end of the 1990s they were transferred under various flags of convenience but soon afterwards sold off to other operators. The ships =Belorussiya= The Belorussiya was launched on 6 March 1974 and delivered on 15 January 1975. She was named after the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Belorussiya was rebuilt into a cruise ship in 1986 at Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven, West Germany. From 1987 until late 1992, Belorussiya was chartered by CTC Cruises to operate budget cruises from Sydney, Australia to ports in the south Pacific region. During this time, Belorussiya operated from Sydney during the Australian summer and in Europe for the rest of the year.Plowman, Peter (2007). Australian Cruise Ships. Rosenberg Publishing. p. 35. On 25 October 1992, while in drydock in Singapore, the ship developed a heavy list and filled with water. She was eventually floated out in January 1993 and sailed to Lloyd Werft, where her interiors were entirely rebuilt. On completion of the refit on 9 December 1993 she was renamed Kazakhstan II. From 22 December 1993 onwards she was chartered to Delphin Seereisen, Germany. In June 1995 she was sold to Lady Lou Shipping Co, Cyprus. In May 1996 Delphin Seereisen purchased the vessel and renamed her Delphin. As of 2009, Delphin is in service with Hansa Kreuzfahrten in Germany. =Gruziya= The Gruziya was launched on 18 October 1974 and delivered on 30 June 1975. She was named after the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Gruziya was rebuilt into a cruise ship between 1984 or 1988, due to different sources stating different years. In 1995 she was transferred under the ownership of Blasco UK, transferred under Liberian flag and renamed Odeassa Sky. On 26 August 1995 she was arrested in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and remained there for at least five months. In August 1996 she reverted to Ukrainian flag. On 11 September 1996 she arrived at Wilhelmshaven, Germany for engine inspection, but was subsequently arrested in the port of Wilhelmshaven due to unpaid debts of her owners. In August 1998 she was sold to the Dutch businessman Gerard van Leest, and subsequently rebuilt in Bremerhaven, Germany for cruise traffic. Renamed Club I, the ship begun making short cruises from Rotterdam under the banner of Club Cruise in April 1999. In December 1999 she was renamed Van Gogh and chartered to Nouvelles Frontieres. She was later chartered to Travelscope, without a change of name, until Travelscope went bankrupt in December 2007. Following the bankruptcy of Travelscope, Club Cruise established a new subsidiary, Van Gogh Cruises to operate the Van Gogh. This was not a success and in 2009 the ship was sold to Salamis Lines, Cyprus and renamed Salamis Filoxenia. =Azerbaizhan= The Azerbaizhan was launched on 14 April 1975 and delivered on 18 December 1975. She was named after the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The Azerbaizhan was converted to a cruise ship at Lloyd Werft, West Germany in 1986.Miller (1995). p. 14 In early 1996 she was transferred under the ownership of Blasco UK, transferred under Liberian flag and renamed Arkadia, but already in July 1996 she reverted to Ukrainian flag. In 1997 she was chartered to SeaEscape, United States under the name Island Holiday. In 1998 she was chartered to Commodore Cruise Lines and renamed Enchanted Capri. In 2001 she was laid up, until chartered to Señor Demar of Mexico in 2003. Demar purchased the ship on 1 November 2006. =Kazakhstan= The Kazakhstan was launched on 17 October 1975 and delivered in June 1976. She was named after the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.

On 2 September 1996 she was chartered to Royal Seas Cruises Lines, reverted to Ukrainian flag and used for cruising from Tampa. After the end of charter in January 1997 she reverted to the name Ukraina and was chartered to SeaEscape. On 13 February 1998 she was renamed Island Adventure but continued service with SeaEscape until the company ceased operations in August 2008.http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/local/MI99844/ The ship never re- entered service and was sold for scrap in 2011. In January 2012, the ship was photographed beached in Alang, India. By early March, most of the forward section of the ship has been removed. =Kareliya= The Kareliya was launched on 14 April 1976 and delivered in December 1976. She was the only Belorussiya class ship not named after a Soviet Socialist Republic (Karelia being an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic at the time). On 1 June 1981 she was grounded while on a cruise near Arrecife, Canary Isles, and her passengers had to be evacuated. Following the grounding she sailed to Tyne, United Kingdom for repairs. In addition to repairs the chance was taken to convert her into a cruise ship. The Kareliya received a more extensive expansion of her forward superstructure than her other sisters. In December 1982 the Kareliya was renamed Leonid Brezhnev in honour of the recently-deceased long-time General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev. In 1989 the ship reverted to her original name.Miller (1995). p. 63 In 1995 the Kareliya was transferred to Maddock Trading and re-flagged to Liberia. In 1996 she reverted to Ukrainian flag. On 17 March 1997 she was arrested at Nouméa due to debts of her owners. In May 1998 she was sold to Kaalbye Group, renamed Olvia and moved back under the Liberian flag. On 17 September 2001 she was sold to K&O; Shipping and used for service with Peace Boat. On 20 December 2004 she was renamed Neptune, on 14 April 2005 CT Neptune and on 27 May 2006 she reverted to Neptune. Subsequently, she was sold to Walden Maritime and used for casino cruising out of Hong Kong.

Origins The Eight Deliberations were established by the Wei Dynasty during the Three Kingdoms period and originated from similar regulations in the Rites of Zhou. These suggested that criminals qualified under the following eight conditions could be considered for a commutation of sentence: *Relatives of the sovereign *Old acquaintances of the sovereign *Individuals of great virtue *Individuals of great ability *Meritorious individuals *High officials *Individuals exceptionally zealous at their government duties *Guests of the sovereign (i.e. the descendants of preceding imperial families) p. 177 Eight Deliberations as a Legal Privilege The earliest records of the whole set of Eight Deliberations existing nowadays can be found in the Tang Code, with its Article 7 exactly entitled the same name. According to it, permission from the emperor was required before any kind of interrogation or judgement could be carried out towards the offenders of the legally favored categories. However, as pointed out in Article 8, the legal privilege was not applicable to cases involving violation of the Ten Abominations.Johnson, Wallace Stephen: The T’ang Code, Volume I, General Principles, page 83-89. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979. Since the Eight Deliberations was introduced, all of the following Chinese dynasties maintained the installment of this system to their law. =Deliberation for Relatives of the Emperor= Deliberation for Relatives of the Emperor () included the relatives of the emperor of the sixth degree of mourning and closer. In addition, the emperor's paternal grandmother's and his mother's relatives within the fifth or closer degree of mourning, the empress's relatives within the fourth or closer degree of mourning were also considered. =Deliberation for Old Retainers of the Emperor= Deliberation for Old Retainers of the Emperor () included those who had been in the emperor's service for a long period of time thereby merited this favor. =Deliberation for the Morally Worthy= Deliberation for the Morally Worthy () included worthy men or superior men whose speech and conduct were greatly virtuous and may be taken as a model for the country. =Deliberation for Ability= Deliberation for Ability () included people of great talent, able to lead armies, manage the affairs of government, correct the course of the emperor, and serve as a model for human relationships. =Deliberation for Achievement= Deliberation for Achievement () included those of great achievement and glory because of their capability of leading armies for a long distance or civilizing the multitudes. =Deliberation for High Position= Deliberation for High Position () included all active duty officials of the third rank () and above, titular officials of the second rank and above, and persons with noble titles of the first rank. =Deliberation for Diligence= Deliberation for Diligence () included military and civil officials who have displayed great diligence in their work through thorough occupation of public affairs or experiencing dangerous difficulties. =Deliberation for Guests of the State= Deliberation for Guests of the State () was to treat the descendants of previous dynasties as guests of the state who could enjoy a legal privilege.

Library of Congress Federal Research Division (August 1994). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.  Family life  Seychellois society is essentially matriarchal. Mothers tend to be dominant in the household, controlling most current expenditures and looking after the interests of the children. Unwed mothers are the societal norm, and the law requires fathers to support their children. Men are important for their earning ability, but their domestic role is relatively peripheral. Older women can usually count on financial support from family members living at home or contributions from the earnings of grown children. = Violence against women = Domestic violence against women was a continuing problem. Police rarely intervened in domestic disputes unless it involved a weapon or major assault. The authorities often dismissed the few cases that reached a prosecutor, or the court gave the perpetrator a light sentence. There was growing societal concern about domestic violence and increased recognition of the need to address it. Rape, spousal rape, and domestic abuse are criminal offences punishable by a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment. During 2007, the Family Tribunal registered 74 domestic violence complaints. The police registered 56 rape cases and four cases of attempted sexual assault. The Social Affairs Division of the Ministry of Health and Social Development and Women in Action and Solidarity Organization, a local NGO, provided counseling services to rape victims.  Wider society  Miss Seychelles 2008, Elene Angine There is no officially sanctioned gender discrimination in employment and women are well represented in business. As of 1994, women formed nearly half of the enrollment at the prestigious Seychelles Polytechnic, the highest level of education on the islands. As of 2007, there were 10 women in the 34-seat National Assembly, seven elected by direct election and three by proportional representation.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Seychelles (2007) Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 11, 2008).

Prostitution is illegal but remains prevalent. Police generally do not apprehend prostitutes unless their actions involved other crimes. The law prohibits sexual harassment but is rarely enforced. Inheritance laws do not discriminate against women.

It was released to OEM hardware partners on July 22, 2009 and became generally available on October 22, that year. It is the successor to the Windows Vista-based Windows Server 2008, released the previous year. Enhancements in Windows Server 2008 R2 include new functionality for Active Directory, new virtualization and management features, version 7.5 of the Internet Information Services web server and support for up to 256 logical processors. It is built on the same kernel used with the client-oriented Windows 7, and is the first server operating system released by Microsoft to exclusively support 64-bit processors. Microsoft stopped providing security updates and technical support for Windows Server 2008 R2 RTM since April 9, 2013, and Service Pack 1 must be installed to continue receiving support and updates on any given Windows operating system. Seven editions of Windows Server 2008 R2 were released: Foundation, Standard, Enterprise, Datacenter, Web, HPC Server and Itanium, as well as Windows Storage Server 2008 R2. A home server variant called Windows Home Server 2011 was also released. Windows Server 2008 R2 was succeeded by the Windows 8-based Windows Server 2012. History Microsoft introduced Windows Server 2008 R2 at the 2008 Professional Developers Conference as the server variant of Windows 7. On January 7, 2009, a beta release of Windows Server 2008 R2 was made available to subscribers of Microsoft's TechNet and MSDN programs, as well as those participating in the Microsoft Connect program for Windows 7. Two days later, the beta was released to the public via the Microsoft Download Center. On April 30, 2009, the release candidate was made available to subscribers of TechNet and MSDN. On May 5, 2009, the release candidate was made available to the general public via the Microsoft download center. According to Windows Server Blog, the following are the dates of the year 2009 when Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 has been made available to various distribution channels: * OEMs received Windows Server 2008 R2 in English and all language packs on July 29. The remaining languages were available around August 11. * Independent software vendor (ISV) and independent hardware vendor (IHV) partners have been able to download Windows Server 2008 R2 from MSDN starting on August 14. * IT professionals with TechNet subscriptions were able to download Windows Server 2008 R2 and obtain product keys for English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish variants beginning August 14 and all remaining languages beginning August 21. * Developers with MSDN subscriptions have been able to download and obtain product keys for Windows Server 2008 R2 in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish starting August 14 and all remaining languages starting August 21. * Microsoft Partner Program (MPP) gold/certified members were able to download Windows Server 2008 R2 through the MPP portal on August 19. * Volume licensing customers with an existing Software Assurance (SA) contracts were able to download Windows Server 2008 R2 on August 19 via the Volume License Service Center. * Volume licensing customers without an SA were able to purchase Windows Server 2008 R2 through volume licensing by September 1. Additionally, qualifying students have been able to download Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard edition in 15 languages from the Microsoft Imagine program (known as DreamSpark at the time). Microsoft has announced that Server 2008 R2 will be the last version of Windows supporting the Itanium architecture, with its extended support ending earlier than for the regular non-Itanium edition or \\"until July 10, 2018.\\" New features A reviewer guide published by the company describes several areas of improvement in R2. These include new virtualization capabilities (Live Migration, Cluster Shared Volumes using Failover Clustering and Hyper-V), reduced power consumption, a new set of management tools and new Active Directory capabilities such as a \\"recycle bin\\" for deleted objects. IIS 7.5 has been added to this release which also includes updated FTP server services. Security enhancements include encrypted clientless authenticated VPN services through DirectAccess for clients using Windows 7, and the addition of DNSSEC support for DNS Server Service. Even though DNSSEC as such is supported, only one signature algorithm is available: #5/RSA/SHA-1. Since many zones use a different algorithm – including the root zone – this means that in reality Windows still can't serve as a recursive resolver. The DHCP server supports a large number of enhancements such as MAC address-based control filtering, converting active leases into reservations or Link Layer based filters, DHCppP Name protection for non-Windows machines to prevent name squatting, better performance through aggressive lease database caching, DHCP activity logging, auto-population of certain network interface fields, a wizard for split-scope configuration, DHCP Server role migration using WSMT, support for DHCPv6 Option 15 (User Class) and Option 32 (Information Refresh Time). The DHCP server runs in the context of the Network Service account which has fewer privileges to reduce potential damage if compromised. Windows Server 2008 R2 supports up to 64 physical processors or up to 256 logical processors per system. (Only the Datacenter and Itanium editions can take advantage of the capability of 64 physical processors. Enterprise, the next-highest edition after those two, can only use 8.) When deployed in a file server role, new File Classification Infrastructure services allow files to be stored on designated servers in the enterprise based on business naming conventions, relevance to business processes and overall corporate policies. Server Core includes a subset of the .NET Framework, so that some applications (including ASP.NET web sites and Windows PowerShell 2.0) can be used. Performance improvement was a major area of focus for this release; Microsoft has stated that work was done to decrease boot time, improve the efficiency of I/O operations while using less processing power, and generally improve the speed of storage devices, especially iSCSI. Active Directory has several new features when raising the forest and domain functional levels to Windows Server 2008 R2: Two added features are Authentication Mechanism Assurance and Automatic SPN Management. When raising the forest functional level, the Active Directory recycle bin feature is available and can be enabled using the Active Directory Module for PowerShell.  Support lifecycle  Support for Windows Server 2008 R2 installed was terminated on April 9, 2013, and users will not be able to receive further security updates for the operating system, due to new policies dictating that only the service pack on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 will continue to be supported with security updates, lasting until the end of support lifecycle for that Windows operating system. The host without the latest Windows Server 2008 R2 service pack installed is vulnerable to viruses and multiple security attacks. On January 13, 2015, Windows Server 2008 R2 exited mainstream support and entered the extended support phase; Microsoft continued to provide security updates every month for Windows Server 2008 R2, however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes were no longer being offered. Extended support ended on January 14, 2020, at the age of 10 after the release of Windows Server 2008 R2. On July 12, 2018, Microsoft announced a paid \\"Extended Security Updates\\" service that will offer additional updates for Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard, Enterprise and Datacenter for up to three years after the end of extended support. In August 2019, researchers reported that \\"all modern versions of Microsoft Windows\\" may be at risk for \\"critical\\" system compromise due to design flaws of hardware device drivers from multiple providers. In the same month, computer experts reported that the BlueKeep security vulnerability, , that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's Remote Desktop Protocol, allowing for the possibility of remote code execution, may now include related flaws, collectively named DejaBlue, affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., Windows 7 and all recent versions) as well. In addition, experts reported a Microsoft security vulnerability, , based on legacy code involving Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe), that affects all Windows versions from the older Windows XP version to the most recent Windows 10 versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available. In September 2019, Microsoft announced that it would provide free security updates for Windows 7 on federally-certified voting machines through the 2020 United States elections. Service Pack On February 9, 2011, Microsoft officially released Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 to OEM partners. Apart from bug fixes, it introduces two new major functions, RemoteFX and Dynamic Memory. RemoteFX enables the use of graphics hardware support for 3D graphics in a Hyper-V based VM. Dynamic Memory makes it possible for a VM to only allocate as much physical RAM as is needed temporarily for its execution. On February 16, SP1 became available for MSDN and TechNet subscribers as well as volume licensing customers. As of February 22, SP1 is generally available for download via the Microsoft Download Center and available on Windows Update.
