The club was founded in 1931 by Leslie Edward Smith. In 2008 Ormond welcomed back recently retired AFL player Matthew Robbins as player and assistant coach. After competing in B grade in season 2009, Ormond were narrowly relegated and subsequently moved down to C grade for 2010. In 2008 the Club won the C Grade premiership, defeating Hampton Rovers 15.12 (102 points) to 9.10 (64 points).  History  The club was founded in the early years of the Great Depression. A local businessman named Les Smith, believed that the local young people needed a constructive way to channel their energies in difficult times, and that he was able to help them do that through sport. Smith had himself been nurtured as a young player of Australian Rules Football in the Albert Park State School team, which included himself, Roy Cazaly and Frank Beaurepaire. All three had been presented with their uniforms by Henry Harrison, a founding member of the Australian Rules game in the early 1860s.Commander Stan Veale, Letter to \\"The Southern Cross\\", Oct 10, 1979. At the beginning of the 1930s, Smith approached a friend, Councillor Ernie Gunn, to prevail on the local council for a grant of land. Gunn arranged this, and in 1931 the Ormond Amateur Football Club was born. Smith served as president for most of the years between the first playing season, 1932, and 1959. Les Smith's daughter, Betty Macgregor, recalls the club's foundation: > Dad was a champion footballer in the bush in his youth. He was dubbed the > \\"Gippsland Flyer\\". He was training with South Melbourne when World War One > broke out. Our family moved back to the city from Maffra at the start of the > Depression, and we opened a newsagency on the corner of North Road and > Newham Grove in Ormond. It was here that a lot of the planning was done to > establish the club. Of course it was a group effort. The original nucleus of > founders included Cec Hattam, Mick Hassett, Peter Dawson and \\"Doc\\" Porter. > Fred Yewdall was an early player who later went on to serve on the > committee, so he was also involved with the club in one way or another from > the early years. I remember Ernie Gunn as a very nice man, and a solid > citizen. He was keen to help in any way he could. He made it all possible, > by arranging for Council to give us some land. My Dad's regimental colours > from World War One - brown and blue - were chosen as the Ormond club > colours. The first function the club had was an afternoon fancy dress party > to raise funds. I would have been seven or eight. Everyone met outside the > newsagency. Dad came out dressed as a policeman, then they were on their way > amid great hilarity - marching down Newham Grove to the ground, where they > had a function to celebrate the birth of the club. Training was on Tuesday > and Thursday. On Sunday morning everyone gathered at the ground for a post- > mortem of the previous day's game, to assess injuries, and plan for the next > week. Everyone came to that - players, groundsmen and committee. Dad served > as president for many years. Mum and Dad threw many parties and gatherings > for Ormond players and committee members. Our family's lives revolved around > the club for years. My Uncle Roy Smith - Dad's younger brother - was the > club's rep on the Amateur Football Association. He was a leading wine judge, > and would bring a flask of sherry to the game. At three-quarter time he > would offer players a nip, which some availed themselves of.

At three-quarter time we'd have afternoon tea. > Dave McNamara, one of the VFL's pre-War greats, came out of retirement to > play some games with Ormond. I remember him putting the ball on the ground > and doing place kicks. Bob Flegg was Ormond's most brilliant full forward of > that time - he was later killed in the War. You would often get a few > hundred to a match in those days. If it were a final, it would be a few > thousand. After each home match, those who liked a drink would adjourn to > McKinnon's Hotel. The session wouldn't go long, due to six o'clock closing. > We'd wait outside with Mum in the car till the pub shut. We had a picture > night at the local cinema sometimes.

He served in the House of Representatives from 1903 to 1919, and served as an honorary minister under Prime Minister Joseph Cook from 1913 to 1914. Early life Kelly was born in Sydney and educated at All Saints College, Bathurst, and Eton College from 1893 to 1896. He married Olive Miller (better-known under the stage name of Olive Morrell) in London in January 1908. Politics In 1903 Kelly was elected to the seat of Wentworth in the Australian House of Representatives, representing the Free Trade Party. In parliament, Kelly was known for his habit of smoking cigars in the chamber, although he was eventually asked to stop by the speaker Frederick Holder. This combined with his Etonian manners meant he was held in little regard by the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Billy Hughes once said that he had \\"as much idea of the work of the world as a butterfly has of casting an 81-ton gun\\". In May 1909, at the instigation of Alfred Deakin, Kelly moved the motion to adjourn that ended ALP leader Andrew Fisher's first term as prime minister. From June 1913 to September 1914, Kelly was an honorary minister in the Cook Ministry. He reversed King O'Malley's decision to build Walter Burley Griffin's plan for Canberra using the departmental plan and instead appointed Griffin as Federal capital director of design and construction. He also negotiated a plan for standardisation of Australia's rail gauge, but this was scrapped when the Fisher government came to power in September 1914. He was in opposition until the formation of the Nationalist Government in February 1917. He did not get a ministry in the Hughes government and retired at the 1919 election. Later life Kelly separated from his wife, who took their daughter back to England. He died at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in the Sydney suburb of Camperdown, aged eighty-two. He was the last surviving member of Joseph Cook's Cabinet, as well as the last surviving MP who served during Alfred Deakin's three tenures as Prime Minister, as well as during the Prime Ministerships of Chris Watson, George Reid and Andrew Fisher's first tenure. His younger brother was the composer and oarsman Frederick Septimus Kelly.

Léon Serpollet was born in Culoz, in the Ain department of France in 1859, son of the carpenter Auguste Serpollet. He went into the family business with his brother Henri (1848-1915) producing circular saws and wood working machines. It was when seeking to power their workshops that Henri came up with the idea of flash steam generation, with a patent applied for on 25th October 1879. Leon went to Paris to study engineering at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, and at the same time he continued to develop the flash steam concept with his brother by post.Les frères Serpollet, In 1886 the two brothers arrived at their best design of flash steam boiler, and then shortly afterwards they went into business building flash steam boilers, initially small scale to power lighting systems and pumps, but soon to power tricycles and steam boats, and eventually to cars, trams, and buses. Not only was Léon Serpollet a talented engineer, but he also drove his own cars in various races and rallies, for in the first years of the 20th century his steam cars were faster than any internal combustion engine cars, as he proved when he took the world land speed record in 1902 at Nice promenade at 120.80 km/h. This was the first time a car had been timed at over 100 km/h. Serpollet's steam cars meant he had contact with many distinguished customers, including the future King Edward VII, the Maharajah of Mysore, and the Shah of Persia - Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar, who in 1900 conferred on him the Order of the Lion and the Sun.The Serpollet Steam Automobile, Scientific America, 8th December 1900, p357 In 1900 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Leon Serpollet died aged 48 of a 'malignant disease', and with his passing the interest in steam cars seemed to wane, especially in France, there were no steam cars on show at the Paris Salon automobile show of 1908.The Stanley Steam Car, Field, 27 Mar 1909, p59 His influence on the automotive industry had been substantial as stated in many obituaries, for example \\"The death of M. Leon Serpollet has removed from our midst a pioneer in the motor industry, whose genius in the cause of automobilism can only be compared to that of Stephenson for the locomotive\\"....\\"The death of M. Serpollet is a heavy loss to the industry.\\"The Late M. Leon Serpollet, The Bystander, 20 Feb 1907, p48 In another obituary \\"M. Serpollet's name has been for a score of years as well known in the world of the steam motor-car as is that of Marquis de Dion in the region of internal combustion vehicles\\".Obituary, Daily Telegraph & Courier (London), 12 Feb 1907, p11 Léon Serpollet is commemorated by a statue by Jean Boucher at the Place Saint-Ferdinand () in Paris' 17th arrondissement, and the ' () in its 18th arrondissement.  Serpollet frères et Cie  left In 1886 Leon teamed up with an industrialist, Larsonneau, an enthusiastic partner who helps him to create “Serpollet frères et Cie” and to open workshops on rue des Cloÿs in Paris, in the 18th district, a location that has become the Parc Léon Serpollet today.Paris Walking Tours - Parc Léon Serpollet. Léon continued to revise and develop the flash steam boiler design changing it from flat plates to tubes, which led to further patents (e.g. CH1038 1889, CH7958 1894, CH12280 1896). Léon's engineering talents had been spotted by Armand Peugeot who provided the firm with financial support. Serpollet then used his flash boiler to create a steam powered tricycle, which was exhibited by Peugeot at the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. Peugeot produced several of the steam tricycles under licence, now known as the Peugeot Type 1. In the 1890s Léon Serpollet was involved in applying his flash steam boiler to tramcars. In January 1897 he entertained a deputation from Aberdeen at his depot in Willesden, London, where he displayed a 4-seater Phaeton, and a double-decker steam tramcar for 50 people running on a test track.The Serpollet Steam System of Motors, The Automotor and Horseless Vehicle Journal, Jan 1897, pp146-148 The key characteristics of flash steam boilers stem from the fact that there is very little water in the boiler at any moment, which leads to fast startup, and minimal explosion risk - they also provide high steam pressures and temperatures which can give high thermal efficiency, but were not ideal for the steam engines of the time. In addition flash boilers needed a sophisticated control system to ensure the water injected to the boiler and the heat from the burner matched, and that the steam produced matched the demand of the engine. In addition to the control system, Léon also had to devise a better steam engine design suited to very high pressure steam, using poppet valves the actuation of which presents a problem with providing the variable cut-off needed to allow steam to work expansively. Numerous Serpollet patents in different countries cover the inventions designed to overcome these difficulties (e.g. CH12280 30 May 1896, GB190005128 17 Mar 1900, US680000 6 Aug 1901). The solution was to use a form of variable valve timing, where the camshaft moved along its axis and so changed the cam profile driving the valve movements - this arrangement also allowing the Serpollet engine to be reversed.  Gardner-Serpollet  Main article Gardner-Serpollet In 1898 the brothers met a wealthy investor named Frank Gardner, and together they formed the Gardner-Serpollet Company. The performace of the cars they produced was very competitive against the internal combustion engines of the time. For example at the Bexhill Speed Trials in 1902, Léon Serpollet in a 20HP Gardner- Serpollet Racing Car won the Daily Mail Cup, and the Paris Cup, and an 8HP Gardner-Serpollet with 4 people aboard won the Tourist class.Advertisment, Reading Mercury, 21 Jun 1902, p9 Léon Serpollet also held the World land speed record, at , achieved in April 1902 driving the steam powered Gardner- Serpollet ' ('Easter Egg'). Gardner-Serpollet also got involved in steam boats, and exhibited one at the Steam Boat Exhibition in Monaco in 1904.Motor Boat Exhibition, London Evening Standard, 31 Mar 1904, p3 A further business interest of Gardner-Serpollet was in railway steam-cars, which they named 'autonomobile' carriages, and in December 1902 and January 1903 it was widely reported that three of the new powered carriages were scheduled in June 1903 to run from Paris to Dijon at 100km/hour.Future of Our Railways, Northern Whig, 15 Dec 1902, p10 However there appears to be no records to confirm this happened.  Darracq-Serpollet  In 1906 the Darracq-Serpollet company was formed for the manufacture of steam omnibuses and heavy traction vehicles, with Leon Serpollet as one of the managing directors.Darracq-Serpollet, Globe, 5 May 1906, p9A Darracq-Serpollet Company, Westminster Gazette, 23 May 1916, p11 Later in 1906 a Darracq-Serpollet omnibus made a demonstration tour of England and Scotland, it attracted great interest, and was reported to do 6 miles on a gallon of paraffin.The Darracq-Serpollet Steam Omnibus, Peterhead Sentinel and General Advertiser for Buchan District, 01 Sep 1906, p5 The Darracq-Serpollet buses and commercial vehicles used the double-acting two cylinder version of the Serpollet patented engine design. Unfortunately, in the autumn of 1906 Leon Serpollet developed symptoms of a serious illness, dying in February 1907, and this had a major impact on the business, which has been at the time transitioning from the old works of M. Serpollet to a new factory.London Stock Exchange Notes, Freeman's Journal, 18 Dec 1907, p3 The new factory was in use by late 1907, and many buses were made, notably for the Metropolitan Steam Omnibus Company who ordered 20 in 1907New Steam Omnibuses in London. Commercial Motor, 24 October 1907 increasing to 63 later,Steam had a go on London's streets too, New Scientist, 20 Sep 2017 and the National Steam Car Company,Experimental Flash Steam, J.H. Benson and A.A. Rayman, Model and Allied Publications, 1973, , p22. Commercial vehicles were also made and in a report on a trial of Daracq-Serpollet vehicles Commercial Motor magazine gave details of the steam generator, saying steam pressures of 300psi were typical but this could be increased to 900psi with the steam pipes glowing dull red.Vehicles in the Trials, Commercial Motor, 3 Oct 1907 Darracq- Serpollet were not purely omnibus builders, and at the commercial motor show at Olympia in 1908 they exhibited a new 12-15hp chassis suitable for light vans, a 30-40hp bus or lorry chassis, the same chassis fitted with a 3-ton van body (by Liversidge), a 30-40hp lorry with cast steel wheels, a 30-40hp Metropolitan Steam Omnibus Company double-decker bus, and a 20-25hp 2-ton lorry with body by Bayleys Ltd.Darracq-Serpollet Omnibus Company Limited, Commercial Motor, 26 Mar 1908, p71 However, while there were good reports of the vehicles, the Darracq-Serpollet business was not profitable and was wound down in 1910, being eventually closed completely in 1912. The Metropolitan Steam Omnibus Company ceased using its Darracq-Serpollet steam buses on 16th October 1912, but many buses were sold on and used elsewhere. AH Creeth & Sons of the Isle of Wight acquired its first Darracq-Serpollet steam bus in 1909,Motorbus, Commercial Motor, 25 Mar 1909 and went on to acquire 3 more, reputed to be the last Darracq-Serpollet steam buses in service before they gave way to petrol in 1919.The Steam Car - Its rise and decline on the Island, Portsmouth Evening News, 5th Mar 1930, p7  References  See also *History of steam road vehicles Category:1858 births Category:1907 deaths Category:French inventors Category:French industrialists Category:Tram manufacturers ","title":"Léon Serpollet"},{"id":"13061559","text":"Jasna Kolar-Merdan (born 19 October 1956 in Mostar) is a former Yugoslav handball player who competed in the 1980 Summer Olympics, in the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the 1992 Summer Olympics.

After being decommissioned in 1945 the site was used for auctioning redundant ex-military vehicles and equipment, with the depot finally closing in 1983. The auctions were known nationally and were held every eight weeks; each auction lasted for about a week and their popularity caused them to be advertised in the national press, which attracted dealers from all over the country. The park is now situated on the site of the disused Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) depot. The buildings were reduced to rubble when the park was reclaimed and designed by Nottinghamshire County Council. The rubble was used to landscape the site, almost 140,000 trees were planted and a 70,000 m3 lake created. Some areas, including Fowemer Hill were raised by 7 metres. Work began in 1989 and the park was finally completed in 1993 at a cost of £3.5 million. Originally the site was to be used for housing but the district council were against the idea. It was then suggested that the site be used as a business park with landscaped surroundings. The Transport Heritage Centre was added as another idea to add greater interest to the site. In 1999 a part of the play area was destroyed by an arson attack. The damage cost £14,000 to repair but is the only serious piece of willful damage to date. It is now managed by Rushcliffe Borough Council with a team of full-time rangers and dedicated team of volunteers. Facilities right right right right The park is a natural habitat for wildlife, including a family of swans who first took up residence in May 1996 and is also used as an open space for recreational activities. It is open 365 days of the year although the car park has opening times dependent on the time of year. The car park was improved in early 2009 to improve safety and again in 2018 to create an additional 20 spaces. There are over of pathways situated between landscaped areas, grassland, wildflower meadows, community gardens and woodlands which are used by walkers, joggers and cyclists. The park is also located next to Ruddington Fields Business Park and the Nottingham Transport Heritage Centre which is open every Sunday and Bank Holiday from Easter Sunday to late October, with its collection of steam trains and classic buses. Recreation There are numerous recreational activities within the park including three Natural Heritage Trails of varying length which are followed by markers: *Yellow Trail – *Red Trail – *Blue Trail – A play area for children was built in 1996 at a cost of £180,000 and now has over twenty pieces of play equipment including two items of play equipment designed for disabled visitors, specifically a swing and roundabout which have been designed in conjunction with carers and professionals and include full body support and removable harnesses. The whole play area underwent a £60,000 refurbishment in spring 2008 which added extra equipment for children whatever their needs. A skateboard ramp was built in 2000 due to the enthusiasm of local teenagers who raised funds for its construction and there is a small refreshment stand close by along with public toilets. There is a man made lake fed from a culvert (Gibsons Dyke) with reed beds covering two hectares, which serve as an important habitat for many species of birds and insect life. The park is an ideal place to spot wildlife in a natural habitat. The park hosts several annual events, including a kite festival (which also boasts vintage fairground rides, farmers market and craft fair) and an annual 10k charity race including a 2k fun run. In March 2009, the nominated 10k charity race was in aid of Cerebral Palsy Sport. In spring 2008 work began on a 4-cross cycle track which opened in May The track has been designed by Council engineers and members of the Free Riders 4-cross club and was partly funded by a £20,000 grant. A series of obstacles have been developed on a hillside including table tops, ski jumps, drop offs and double / triple jumps which will be to competition standards. It is intended that the track will be used for competitions, race meetings, daytime and evening school sessions as well as for public use. It will be one of only eight tracks based in the United Kingdom. Environment right Energy An Environmental Education Centre was officially opened in 2005 and is designed to be energy neutral. The project was financed by Nottinghamshire County Council Two Iskra AT5-1 wind turbines were installed in February 2005 which generate power with the excess sold to the National Grid whilst Solar Power is used for water heating along with a Biomass Boiler. Composting toilets have also been installed. Rushcliffe Country Park has received awards for its effective energy management. Conservation Gibbies Wood is an area of the park covering 4.5 hectares named after Arthur Gibson, which is part of the Natural Heritage Project and also a BTCV award winning project. The area appeared to be returning to a marshland and therefore simple, modern drains were laid to discharge water from the site. This in turn created a shallow pond and helped re-establish a part of the marsh. The park is home to a number of types of trees including: English oak, Red oak, Whitebeam, Rowan, Scots pine, Cherry, Yew, Field maple, Lime, Ash, Copper beech, Maple, Silver birch, Alder, Larch right The Wildflower Meadows host over 100 species of flowers and 20 types of grass. From May through to September a succession of flowers attract bees, butterflies and many other insects. Small mammals also live within the meadows which creates a hunting ground for the birds of prey. To date, 262 species of moth, 23 species of butterfly and 130 species of birds have been recorded. There are a number of barn owl boxes throughout the park that attract little owls and kestrels. The 1082 plus species of flora and fauna give the park SINC Status (Site of Importance for Nature Conservation) and Natural England have confirmed the park has Nature Reserve Status. Friends of Rushcliffe Country Park right right The Friends of Rushcliffe Country Park is a voluntary group formed in October 1997 and a registered charity which meets regularly and carries out improvement projects along with conservation work. Recent projects have included the creation of a Garden of Friendship, willow sculptures, a tree identification trail, a sensory walk, and the carving of seats and other features, as well as conservation work such as hedge laying. The Friends of Rushcliffe Park also submitted a bid for lottery funding to provide fitness equipment for adults. This bid was ultimately unsuccessful but the project went ahead anyway. The adult fitness trail is located near the children's park area. Education Rangers provide educational talks to local groups on environmental topics and there are also exhibitions explaining how to live a greener lifestyle. For children there is a tree identification trail, pond dipping, sensory trail, orienteering, adventure orienteering trail and a habitat walk (the ranger-led activities are dependent on the weather and staff availability). Controversy Naming and byelaws In August 1993 the park was officially handed over to Rushcliffe Borough Council by Nottinghamshire County Council. In fierce controversy the park was named 'Rushcliffe Country Park' whilst it had been known locally as 'Ruddington Country Park'. Many local residents still do not recognise the park by its official name, preferring to use its previous proper title. Tree felling In March 2008 a petition was started to prevent the felling of several poplar and sycamore trees along the edge of the A60. It was concluded that twelve poplar trees could pose a danger to traffic as they were stressed and the sycamore trees had taken over the available space restricting the growth of other trees and had killed a hedgerow due to their close proximity blocking light. The petition gained approximately 350 signatures and was handed to Rushcliffe Borough Council. The local council consulted with the Forestry Commission and maintained that once the trees were removed a new hedgerow would be planted which will add to the diversity of wildlife within the park and work begun felling the poplar trees in June 2008. In October 2008 the sycamore trees were felled and at the same time the hedgerow was re-planted with blackthorn, hawthorn and other native plants. The final trees were felled in early 2009 and 500 new trees were planted. The council intends to thin out the newly planted trees accordingly to create a new woodland area. Events A Parkrun takes place every Saturday morning at 9 am.

Horgan made his first appearance for the team during the 1972-73 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1976. During that time he won one All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners' medal and two Munster winners' medals. At club level Horgan played with Tournafulla in a career that spanned four decades. Playing career Club Horgan played his club hurling with his local Tournafulla club. He enjoyed some success as he minded the Tournafulla net for four decades. One of his last games was a county final at intermediate level in 1994 when Horgan was 48 years old. Inter-county Horgan first came to prominence as a member of the Limerick senior inter- county team in the early 1970s. He took over in the number one position in the 1972-73 National Hurling League which Limerick lost to Wexford. In spite of this loss Limerick went on to win the Munster Championship for the first time since 1955, giving Horgan his first provincial medal. Limerick later faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final, however, the Munster champions were burdened with the underdogs tag. In spite of this Limerick powered to a seven- point victory, giving Horgan an All-Ireland medal. In 1974 Horgan won a second consecutive Munster title before lining out in a second consecutive All- Ireland final. Once again Kilkenny provided the opposition. Limerick stormed to an early lead, however, a Pat Delaney shot from midfield bounced on the wet Croke Park surface and between Horgan's legs for a goal. Two more goals for Kilkenny put an end to Limerick's hopes of victory as 'the Cats' emerged the winners by twelve points. Horgan continued hurling at inter-county level until 1976 when he was replaced by Tommy Quaid. Inter-provincial Horgan was sub-goalkeeper to Séamus Durack on the Munster team that lost the Railway Cup final to Leinster in 1974.

The climate is dry, with temperatures a few degrees warmer than Jerusalem temperatures all year round. History Original founding group in nearby Mishor Adumim, October 1977 Founded in October 1977 during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, it was supposed to be located on government lands adjacent to Jericho. Due to the objection of then Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, they were moved to Mishor Adumim. Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon suggested a few days later that they relocate to a barren hilltop overlooking Jericho, its current location. According to ARIJ, in 1978 Israel confiscated 968 dunams of land from the Palestinian site of Nabi Musa in order to construct Mitzpe Yeriho.An Nabi Musa Locality Profile, ARIJ, p. 7 The original residents were a mixed group of both religiously observant and non-observant Jews. They later split up into two groups, and the non-observant members established a new settlement, Vered Yericho, located in the Jordan Valley below Mitzpe Yeriho and closer to Jericho. Still, Mitzpe Yeriho is a community of various traditions and observance levels. While the main synagogue follows Ashkenazi traditions, there are also two Sephardi synagogues, a Chabad synagogue, a Yemenite synagogue, a Carlebach minyan and several other small functioning minyanim.

Hancock, a former partner of Storr and Mortimer. The first shop was opened at a corner of Bruton Street and New Bond Street, in London. It has moved several times since then. Hancocks has become notable for the manufacture of the Victoria Cross medals and also for the various Royal Warrants that it holds. It has been based in The Burlington Arcade in London since 1998. History Charles Frederick Hancock Hancock at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair Hancocks first gallery opened at a corner of Bruton Street and New Bond Street, in London in 1849. Hancocks subsequently moved in 1917 to Vigo Street, in 1970 to Burlington Gardens and 1998 to its current location at 52 & 53 Burlington Arcade. Hancocks has exhibited at several renowned exhibitions. The first exhibition that Hancocks attended was The Great Exhibition of 1851 at The Crystal Palace in London. It then participated in exhibitions in Paris in 1867 and Vienna in 1873 where Hancocks was awarded medals of excellence. Hancocks continues to participate in major exhibitions such as Grosvenor House, Maastricht and New York. In 1998, Hancocks acquired the business of S.J.Rood, diamond merchants and jewellery manufacturers. S.J.Rood were themselves awarded The Royal Warrant by Queen Mary (wife of King George V) in 1921 and are famous as the creators of the “For....” series of rings which were gifted to Queen Mary’s ladies-in- waiting on their marriage. Hancocks currently occupy the former S.J.Root premises in Burlington Arcade. Royal Appointments and Warrants On 13 August 1849, after only eight months in business, Hancocks received the Royal Appointment of Queen Victoria. Many of the principal sovereigns of Europe also became regular patrons. There can be little doubt that the rapid expansion by Charles Hancock during the formative years of the Company led to Hancocks being entrusted with the design and production of the Victoria Cross on the inception of the award in 1856. This medal is still made exclusively by Hancocks. In 1962 the Company was granted the Royal Warrant as Goldsmiths and Silversmiths to Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother.  S.J.Rood  S.J. Rood was established in London’s Burlington Arcade in 1873 and operated independently until they were acquired by Hancocks in 1998. Hancocks then took over the Rood premises in Burlington Arcade from where they remain trading today. S.J.Rood was established by the Allen family who were diamond merchants in addition to their primary role as jewellery manufacturers and retailers to the rich and famous. From 1900 onwards the firm enjoyed great success with affluent Londoners and was awarded the Royal Warrant by Queen Mary, wife of George V, who reigned from 1910 until 1936 (and was then Queen Mother from 1936 until her death in 1952). Queen Mary was an excellent customer and commissioned many pieces with S.J.Rood, both for herself and as gifts for others. Many of these pieces now sell for hefty premiums when they (all too rarely) come onto the open market. S.J.Rood are perhaps most famously known as the manufacturers of the historic “For.....” series of rings which were created for Queen Mary] and which were presented to her ladies-in-waiting on the occasion of their engagement. At least twelve rings are known to have been presented between 1918 and 1952. As Queen Mary was of German descent, her staff were a mixture of English and German ladies. As a consequence, many of the “For.....” rings are now located in either London or Bavaria. Victoria Cross made by Hancock & Co  The \\"For...\\" series of rings  In total, S.J.Rood made 12 rings in the \\"For....\\" series which are known to have been presented by Queen Mary to her ladies-in-waiting on the occasion of their engagement. These are:- The ring \\"For Mary\\" - presented by Queen Mary in 1918. Currently on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

This premises had been abandoned and merely serve as a route to the Catholic Compound and was also used for administering a newly conceived secondary school in that name. The Nigerian Navy considered the site and found it suitable. A team of officers headed by Commodore SO Lawuyi, the Chief of Naval Education, Lt Cdr SEA Olamilokun, SO 1 Education at Naval Headquarters, SLt Nelson Demebide and a civilian architect, were sent to receive the compound. The team took inventories of the facilities at the site and made recommendations for its renovations.  Historical Perspective  Nigerian Navy Secondary School, Abeokuta was founded on 2 February 1991 and is sited at the former St Leo's Teachers' College at Ibara Abeokuta, Ogun State of Nigeria. At the handing over ceremony on that day, the Ogun State Military Governor, Navy Captain Oladeinde Joseph, commended the Nigerian Navy for bringing a model secondary school to Abeokuta. The then Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Murtala Nyako implored the school to train the children who would excel in all. He emphasized that the Nigerian Navy Secondary School Abeokuta, although a civilian secondary school, should be seen as the Nigerian Navy's equivalent of a military school and should be run as such.  First Students  The school started with 623 students admitted into Junior Secondary 1 and Junior Secondary School 2. The pioneer commandant was Lieutenant Commander SEA Olamilokun who took over command of the school on 20 November 1990. The first Executive Officer was Lieutenant SJ Ajiboye. Some of the pioneering staff were Mrs OA Okunneye, Miss Nwogbo, Mr Osinowo, Mr. Oladele and Mr Agoreyo. Other members of staff were SLt Chukwu, Mrs Salako, Miss Ajimati and Mr Adesanya. The first date of any student at school was 3 March 1991. NNSS Abeokuta is an all-boys all boarding school with mild military activities, mainly drills. The Ogun State Government, under the administration of Navy Captain Mohammed Lawal, initiated the complete renovation of all the existing buildings and the major roads in the compound. It also provided an alternative bypass to the priest house. The NN appointed the first commandant to the school on 20 November 1990. The new commandant, Lt Cdr SEA Olamilokun, assumed duties and moved to the compound with his key staff officers. On 2 February 1991, the new Governor of the State, Governor Oladeinde Joseph handed over the school formally to the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral MAH Nyako. It is instructive to note that many senior officers were present at the handing over ceremony. The Governor of Oyo State, Col Adisa who was present promised to build a Guard House for the School, while the Ogun State Government promised to refurbish 3 vehicles for use of the school and refurbish its administrative block. Navy Captain Olukoya, the Governor of Ondo State promised to donate a staff car for the commandant and provide a bus for the students. All the promises were fulfilled.  Current State  Now the school has a student strength of 1060, these pupils are called \\"navy boys\\". The students are divided into four houses: *Blue house (Aikhomu house) *Green house (Nyako house) *Purple house (Koshoni house) *Red house (Omatsola house originally called Kennedy house) These houses are all named after famous navy officers of the country, each house has 4 divisions in them so that there are a total of 16 divisions in the whole school (divisions \\"ALPHA\\" to \\"PAPA\\"). The youngest students start at the first set of four divisions and as they progress in their academic years, they also progress in division groups. The daily routines of the students are as follows:- 05:30 - time to muster for daily assignments (chores or otherwise) 06:30 - students go to the dining hall (which students call \\"galley\\") for breakfast 07:30 - parade time which involves flying the flag, messages from the commandant and marchpast 08:45 - lesson begin 14:30 - lessons end 14:30 - lunch time 15:00 - siesta and guard officers patrol 16:00 - afternoon prep (for homeworks and class assignments) 17:00 - student's free time, training, activities, laundry or labour duties 18:00 - dinner time 19:00 - evening prep 21:30 - end of prep 22:00 - lights out the whole school. (schedules and activities differ according to days of the week for different year groups and divisions) Nigerian Navy Secondary School (a.k.a. NNSS) focuses mainly on hardwork and discipline which is the school motto and the students believe firmly in the Nigerian Navy phrase \\"onward together\\". They are taught teamwork hence their slogan \\"Excel Together\\".  Entry Requirements  For admission into NNSS, applicants need to be of above average intellectual capabilities: they must excel in their entrance examinations and interview which test on mathematical, linguistic, structural logic (quantitative) and analytical (qualitative) abilities. NNSS is known for producing all around best students which either follow in military order or lead civilian lives.commrade focus cafe the new commandant of ibara abeokuta navy secondary school.  Old Students  The Old Students came together recently to form Old Boys Association. A new president for the old boys was appointed and the executive formed. Present at the inauguration of the old students inauguration were 3 former commandants, one former XO and the first VP Academics. It was a great reunion of old teachers, students, and present teachers. The present Director of Naval Education, Commodore Olatunji Olawumi was in attendance and so was Commodore SEA Olamilokun, the pioneering Commandant. Captain Isaac Mankilik, the Commandant implored the old student to work for the progress of the School through networking and purposeful participation.

It was renamed to “Karlova studánka” in 1803 in honour of Archduke Charles Ludwig, who defeated Napoleon in the Battle of Aspern- Essling. Karlova Studánka lies in the valley of the mountain river Opava and is part of the Praděd nature reserve. Nowadays, it is obe of the places in the region with the cleanest air. All local springs have a high proportion of carbon dioxide through peat bogs. It is possible to taste and draw water from the healing springs, in the Drinking Pavilion () where the Wilhelm spring is located, or in the house of Libuše. The town also offers ideal hiking conditions, besides being the starting point of one of the most attractive natural areas with plenty of hiking trails like the route called Bilá Opava Waterfalls (). Bilá Opava river rises on the southern slope of Mt. Praděd at an altitude of 1260 m above sea level. The larger waterfall is almost 8 m-high and the trail is accessed by wooden bridges and stairways. Thanks to its favourable climate and location in the picturesque countryside, the spa serves as a specialized sanatorium providing treatment to patients suffering from diseases of respiratory organs, in the treatment of which the unique pure mountain climate proves to be beneficial.

The role was portrayed by American actress Christina Chambers from July 1, 1998. to the series finale on December 31, 1999. Character history One of the most important characters in the history of Sunset Beach was Maria Torres Evans. She was presumed dead in 1993 and although she never appeared on-screen until 1998, a lot of characters were connected through her. Her husband Ben Evans married Maria whilst she was still a teenager. After her death during a boating trip in a storm, he spent years grieving, and many people suspected that Ben was the one that killed her. Meanwhile, Ben found love in arms of another woman, Meg Cummings. Maria's friend, Annie Douglas Richards tried to play with Meg's mind by forging Maria's diary into thinking that Ben killed Maria, but eventually Annie's plot was discovered. That's when Maria was finally left in peace. In the summer of 1998, Meg befriended an amnesiac woman named Dana in a hospital, who had no idea who she was. It was later discovered by Annie and Tim Truman that Dana is actually Maria. The two plotted to get Maria on the wedding ceremony. After Meg and Ben got married, \\"Dana\\" stormed into the room and surprised everyone who knew her. Ben was shocked to see his wife alive. Maria didn't know anything about the past and she constantly tried to convince everyone that she knows what happened to her, but it was yet in 1999 when she learned more about her past. Maria was the reason why Ben couldn't move on with Meg, and they eventually broke up, although Maria didn't want to be with Ben. In 1999, Maria, Ben, Meg and other were surprised when Tess Marin arrived in Sunset Beach with Benjy Evans, who turned out to be Maria and Ben's son. However, neither of them knew that Benjy was actually Tess' son with Derek Evans, Ben's evil twin brother. Derek returned in 1999 and pretended to be Ben, while he held Ben captive. He slept with Maria. His wrath was discovered and he was killed, while Tess ended up in prison. During the last few episodes, Maria decided to let Ben and Meg be happy, and she met a new man in her life, named Ross English. She also decided to adopt Benjy.

She was used as the English flagship in a number of engagements, including the battles that resulted in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, and had a long career spanning over 50 years. Her fame led to a number of later warships of the Royal Navy being named Ark Royal in her honour, including a number of flagships of the fleet. Construction and early year Ark Royal was originally built to order by the shipbuilder R. Chapman, of Deptford, for Sir Walter Raleigh, who was approximately 32 years of age at the time. The ship was to be called Ark, which became Ark Raleigh, following the convention at the time where the ship bore the name of her owner. The Crown, in the person of Queen Elizabeth I, purchased the ship from Raleigh in January 1587 for the sum of £5,000 (although this took the form of a reduction in the sum Sir Walter owed the queen: he received Exchequer tallies, but no money).Archaeologia, p. 151. Her new commander, Lord High Admiral of England Lord Howard of Effingham, described the sum as \\"money well given\\". She was henceforth to be known as Ark Royal. As built, she had two gun decks, a double forecastle, a quarter deck, and a poop deck right aft. She was an effective warship, but tended to roll heavily, to the discomfort of the embarked soldiers unused to the motion. Career Ark Royal at the Battle of Gravelines Her first action came in 1588 during the attack of the Spanish Armada, when Ark Royal, as one of the largest vessels in the English fleet, was the flagship of Lord High Admiral Howard. After the initial defeat of the Armada, Ark Royal led the chase of the fleeing ships into the North Sea and beyond the Firth of Forth. She was also used as Howard's flagship during the 1596 raid on Cádiz, which resulted in the destruction of much of the Spanish fleet at harbour. Ark Royal was the flagship once more during 1599 when a Spanish invasion again threatened. On the accession of James VI and I to the English throne, Ark Royal was renamed Anne Royal, after his consort, Anne of Denmark. She was then rebuilt at Woolwich Dockyard in 1608 by Phineas Pett I as a 42-gun royal ship. Under her new name, she was the flagship of Lord Wimbledon in the 1625 raid on Cádiz which ended in disaster due to inadequate preparation. Loss She remained in service until April 1636, when she was being moved from the River Medway to serve as the flagship of Sir John Penington. While anchored in shallow water, she struck her own anchorState Papers, p. 376 and elsewhere and stove in her timbers, sinking in the river. She was raised at a cost greater than her original purchase price, but was found to be damaged beyond repair and was broken up in 1638.

He attempts to save the star's jewels but is knocked senseless, and dreams of a wild ride to recover them. Then he wakes up.

It has slender, needle like leaves up to long, and dense panicles of white, red or pink flowers, each about long. Taxonomy It was first published in John Lindley's 1839 A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony, based on specimens collected by James Drummond. Lindley referred to it as a \\"strange species\\" that \\"might be mistaken for a Colletia.\\" It has since had a thoroughly uncomplicated taxonomic history, with no nomenclatural or taxonomic synonyms published. In 1995, however, as part of her treatment of Conospermum for the Flora of Australia series of monographs, Eleanor Bennett published a subspecies, C. acerosum subsp. hirsutum, based on material collected in 1901 by geologist and archaeologist William Dugald Campbell; thus the autonym C. acerosum subsp. acerosum was also invoked. C. acerosum subsp. acerosum has fine red hairs around the flowers and glabrous stems; subspecies hirsutum has fine hairs on the younger stems and leaf bases. Distribution and habitat It occurs in sandy soil, often over laterite, from the Murchison River south to Cape Leeuwin; thus it occurs mainly within the Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions, with some populations in the Avon Wheatbelt and Jarrah Forest regions. Its Flora of Australia entry, published in 1995, states that \\"there is also one doubtful collection from Norseman\\", but this is not (or is no longer) recorded within the West Australian Herbarium's FloraBase database. Ecology It is not considered threatened.

Development history of Great Britain/Ireland proposed connections   Pre-20th century proposals  The failure of the Union Bill 1799 (which succeeded, the next year, as the Act of Union 1800) prompted a satirical description of a proposal by \\"architect\\" William Pitt \\"to build a bridge from Holyhead to the Hill of Howth.\\" Between 1886 and 1900, proposals for a link to Scotland were \\"seriously explored by engineers, industrialists, and Unionist politicians\\". In 1885, Irish Builder and Engineer said a tunnel under the Irish Sea had been discussed \\"for some time back\\". In 1890, engineer Luke Livingston Macassey outlined a Stranraer–Belfast link by tunnel, submerged \\"tubular bridge\\", or solid causeway. In 1897 a British firm applied for £15,000 towards the cost of carrying out borings and soundings in the North Channel to see if a tunnel between Ireland and Scotland was viable.\\"Tunnel Under the Sea\\", The Washington Post, 2 May 1897 (Archive link) The link would have been of immense commercial benefit, was significant strategically and would have meant faster transatlantic travel from the United Kingdom, via Galway and other ports in Ireland. When Hugh Arnold-Foster asked in the Commons in 1897 about a North Channel tunnel, Arthur Balfour said \\"the financial aspects ... are not of a very promising character\\".  20th century  In 1915, a tunnel was proposed by Gershom Stewart as a defence against a German U-boat blockade of Ireland but dismissed by H. H. Asquith as \\"hardly practicable in the present circumstances\\". In 1918, Stewart proposed that German prisoners of war might dig the tunnel; Bonar Law said the Select Committee on Transport could consider the matter. The Senate of Northern Ireland debated a North Channel Tunnel on 25 May 1954. In 1956 Harford Hyde, Unionist Westminster MP for North Belfast, raised a motion in the UK House of Commons for a tunnel across the North Channel.\\"An Irishman's Diary\\" by Wesley Boyd, (Link), The Irish Times, Feb 2004 (subscription required) In 1980, John Biggs-Davison suggested European Economic Community involvement in a North Channel tunnel; Philip Goodhart said no tunnel was planned. (Link has incorrect question; correct question is on preceding page with incorrect answer) In 1988, John Wilson, the Irish Minister for Tourism and Transport, said his department estimated an Irish Sea tunnel would cost twice as much as the English Channel Tunnel and generate one fifth of the revenue, thus being economically unviable. In 1997–98, the Department of Public Enterprise refused to fund a feasibility study requested by the engineering firm Symonds to build an immersed tube tunnel. 21st century Symonds revived the plan in 2000, with an £8 million feasibility study and a £14 billion construction cost estimate. In 2005, the Irish Minister for Transport said he had not studied A Vision of Transport in Ireland in 2050, published in September 2004 by the Irish Academy of Engineering, a report which included a Wexford–Pembroke tunnel. The proposal of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland is supported by members of a number of UK political parties. DUP MP Sammy Wilson compared the idea to the approved Channel Tunnel and HS2 projects. The party made a feasibility study into a tunnel or enclosed bridge a precondition to coalition support in the event of a hung parliament in the 2015 election, and again reiterated the potential for a sea bridge in January 2018. In January 2018, leading figures in the Democratic Unionist Party revived calls for a bridge or tunnel between Larne in County Antrim and Dumfries and Galloway; the estimated £20 billion cost of the project would make it among the biggest infrastructure projects in UK history. The link was proposed by Wilson and Simon Hamilton, a former minister for the party in the Stormont administration. The idea has been further endorsed as a potential solution to boost the economies of Scotland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.  Late 2010s \\"Celtic Crossing\\"  The idea for a Scotland to Northern Ireland Bridge, sometimes branded in the press as the Celtic Crossing or Irish Sea Bridge, was revived in 2018, by Professor Alan Dunlop at the University of Liverpool. He proposed a combined road and rail crossing between Portpatrick, in Dumfries and Galloway, and Larne in Northern Ireland, stating that \\"the coastline between each country is more sheltered and the waterway better protected\\" than the English Channel, where, as Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson had proposed a bridge. He suggested that this would create a 'Celtic powerhouse' due to the potential for an increase in trade between the two countries, and the increase in investment from the construction of the project which he put at between £15 billion and £20 billion (a fraction of the £120 billion cost of the proposed bridge over the English Channel). By 2020 the British government had begun to officially undertake scoping into the possibility of an Irish Sea Bridge.https://www.itv.com/news/2020-02-10/scotland-northern-ireland-bridge- boris-johnson/  Proposed fixed sea links between Great Britain and Ireland  The project has been compared to the Øresund Bridge (pictured), between Sweden and Denmark  North Channel (Galloway) route  This route has been proposed variously as either a tunnel or a bridge. A 2010 report by the Centre for Cross Border Studies estimated building a bridge between Galloway and Ulster would cost just under £20.5 billion. The proposal would see passengers board trains in Glasgow then cross on the bridge via Stranraer and alight in Belfast or Dublin. A longer bridge already exists between Shanghai and Ningbo in East China. Some political parties in Northern Ireland have included the bridge in their manifesto for some time. However, because of the Beaufort's Dyke sea trench which is approximately deep, this route would be deeper than the southern routes between Wales and Ireland. The sea trench was also used for dumping munitions after World War II, and so would require an expensive cleanup operation. Ronnie Hunter, former chairman of the Institute of Civil Engineers Scotland, suggested that the project was a \\"stretch but doable\\". He cited the lack of \\"soft rock, the chalk and sandstone\\" as a challenge compared to the construction of the Channel Tunnel. He also suggested that the change in rail gauge between Ireland and Great Britain might pose further concerns. Such a project was considered by railway engineer Luke Livingston Macassey in the 1890s as \\"a rail link using either a tunnel, a submerged \\"tubular bridge\\" or a solid causeway\\". The north channel crossing was the subject of a 2020 study by the United Kingdom government.  Isle of Man (tunnel) route  There is a possible route for a rail tunnel via Liverpool surfacing on the Isle of Man.  North Channel (Kintyre) route  This is the shortest sea route at around , between Kintyre and County Antrim, but would include either the three hour drive around Loch Fyne and over the landslip-prone Rest and Be Thankful mountain pass, or two further new sea crossings via either the Isle of Arran or Cowal.  Irish Mail route  This route (from Dublin to Holyhead in Anglesey, Wales) would be about long. Avoiding the Saint George's Channel immediately to the south of the route would keep the sea depth less than 300 feet.  Tuskar route  The Institution of Engineers of Ireland's 2004 Vision of Transport in Ireland in 2050 imagines a tunnel to be built between the ports of Fishguard and Rosslare. This route would be approximately twice the distance of the English Channel Tunnel at .A Vision of Transport in Ireland in 2050, IEI report (pdf), The Irish Academy of Engineers, 21 December 2004. A new container port on the Shannon Estuary linking a freight line to Europe is included. This report also includes ideas for a Belfast–Dublin–Cork high-speed train, and for a new freight line from Rosslare to Shannon.  Proposed and existing fixed sea links between Great Britain and France   Channel Tunnel  * The Channel Tunnel operates between Great Britain and France. It is a rail tunnel linking Folkestone, Kent, in the United Kingdom, with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais, near Calais in northern France, beneath the English Channel at the Strait of Dover. At its lowest point, it is 75 m (250 ft) deep. At , the tunnel has the longest undersea portion of any tunnel in the world, although the Seikan Tunnel in Japan is both longer overall at and deeper at below sea level. The speed limit for trains in the tunnel is .\\"The Channel Tunnel infrastructure\\". Getlinkgroup.com. Accessed 24 June 2018. Second Channel tunnel or bridge * A second English Channel tunnel with a road was proposed in 2000 by Eurotunnel, as required by its contract for the original tunnel. The project would have involved the construction of the longest road tunnel in the world, containing two long carriageways, one on top of the other, which would have allowed motorists to complete the journey in about 30 minutes. * An English Channel road bridge was proposed in 2018 by Boris Johnson, who was then foreign secretary. It received limited support.  Channel Islands Tunnel  * The Channel Islands Tunnel was a proposed tunnel between Jersey and Lower Normandy. In July 2009, it was revealed that the States of Jersey were considering the feasibility of building a long tunnel to connect the island with Lower Normandy in France; the tunnel would be a concrete tube sunk in the seabed and then covered over. Talks would be held in September 2009 to ascertain whether it would be of local benefit. The proposition included a road and rail link. The plans were not developed, and the then Assistant Minister for Planning and Environment Deputy Rob Duhamel who had suggested the idea lost his seat in the 2014 elections. Other proposed fixed sea links within or to the British Isles and associated areas  Isle of Man  * In 2018 Professor Alan Dunlop, of the University of Liverpool, suggested a circa 18 mile bridge be built from Scotland to the Isle of Man. This was in addition to his suggestion for a bridge connecting Northern Ireland to Scotland. He suggested that it would help open up the Isle of Man economy.https://www.manxradio.com/news/isle-of-man-news/architect- proposes-iom-scotland-road-link/ * In 2008 the Liverpool Echo ran an article suggesting the construction of a bridge to the Isle of Man from Liverpool. Despite the proposal being nothing more than an April Fools joke, the bridge was included in an engineering text book called the \\"Handbook of International Bridge Engineering\\" in its 2017 edition. *In 2020 the Leeds affiliated branch of European Movement UK suggested an 'Isle of Roundabout' bridge terminal involving four bridges connecting the Isle of Man with England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Although it was widely received as an overly ambitious idea, each bridge would hypothetically be constructed in shallower water than a bridge crossing the Irish Sea. Shetland and Orkney * A possible Orkney tunnel between Scotland and Orkney (about ) was publicly discussed especially around 2005,£100m tunnel to Orkney 'feasible' (10 March 2005) but also at other times. * In 2014 a consultation was undertaken by Orkney Islands Council, with a view to considering a series of fixed links involving seven of the Orkney islands. This would include a bridge between the isles of Eday, Westray and Papa Westray, to alleviate the need for air travel—currently the shortest scheduled flight in the world, and also from Orkney to Shapinsay, Egilsay, Rousay and Wyre, but not a tunnel to Scotland this time. * In 2019 a Shetland Island councilor warned that the island of Whalsay would suffer a “slow and painful death” if talks were not held on building a tunnel or fixed link to replace the ferry service.https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/1727760/mp-calls- for-subsea-tunnels-to-connect-the-western-isles/ * Bridges connecting Orkney to Shetland via the Fair Isle have been mooted at numerous times throughout history with varying degrees of seriousness.  Hebrides  * In 2018 the Western Isles Council began plans to build a series of bridges and tunnels between the Outer Hebrides. The plans proposed bridges between the Sound of Harris and the Sound of Barra as a starting point. Ian Fordham, chairman of Outer Hebrides Tourism, suggested that the scheme would alleviate the pressure on the ferries that operate across the Outer Hebrides. Plans for a tunnel between North Uist and Skye, thereby connecting the Outer Hebrides to the Mainland, had also been mooted.https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/outer-hebrides-could-be- linked-together-by-bridge-plan-1-4701642 In June 2019 a delegation headed up by the Western Isles MP went to the Faroe Islands to assess its tunnel and bridge-link system to see how the infrastructure could be translated to the Hebrides.https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/islands/western- isles/1765802/tunnel-and-bridge-plan-to-link-western-isles-moves-forward/ In 2019 Angus MacNeil MP, chair of the Commons International Trade Committee, voiced his support for the project, and also for a proposed bridge between the Sound of Kerrera off Oban and between Mull and the mainland to ensure the Inner Hebrides were also connected.  Isle of Wight  * A bridge from mainland England to the Isle of Wight has been proposed a number of times, often due to the high cost of ferries to and from the island. The Isle of Wight Party—a political party active only in the Isle of Wight—was set up with the intention of campaigning for a fixed crossing. Critics have suggested that such a link may damage the ecology of the Isle of Wight, particularly the red squirrel population. Campaign group Pro-Link has put forward a number of plans to the Isle of Wight Infrastructure Task Force of the Isle of Wight council, including a £1.2 billion long dual-carriageway tunnel in the Solent between Whippingham on the island and Gosport, Hants. The campaign group has proposed the project be initially run on a toll basis, but that it would have paid for itself after eighteen years. In 2017 Abel Connections Ltd released their plans for the project, \\"to create a new north-south axis through the centre of the Solent region by constructing a tunnel from the M27 east of junction 9 to the Whippingham roundabout on the Isle of Wight, with an additional access intersection ‘cut and cover’ portal near the mainland coast between Browndown and Meon.\\"  Isles of Scilly  * Although bridges connecting some of the individual islands of the Isles of Scilly have been suggested at various points through history, the Cornwall Live newspaper ran a 2018 April Fools Day joke page suggesting that there was a secret plan to connect the Isles of Scilly to the mainland.https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/secret- boris-bridge-plan-extend-1405286  See also  * Rail transport in the United Kingdom * Rail transport in Ireland * Cross-sea traffic ways * Strait of Gibraltar crossing  References  Category:Proposed transport infrastructure in Scotland Category:Proposed bridges in the United Kingdom Category:Tunnels in the Republic of Ireland Category:Proposed undersea tunnels in Europe Category:Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border Category:Borders of Scotland ","title":"Proposed British Isles fixed sea link connections"},{"id":"13062061","text":"Alice Davenport (February 29, 1864 - June 24, 1936) was an American film actress.

The first actress, Vanessa Dorman, portrayed the role from January 9, 1997 to June 18, 1998, when she hit contract problems and was to let go. As of June 24, 1998, she was replaced by Kam Heskin, who portrayed the role until the end of the show, December 31, 1999. Character history Caitlin was presented as the daughter of a rich lawyer Gregory Richards and Olivia Richards. She fell in love with Cole Deschanel, a mysterious jewel thief and their love was constantly threatened by her over-protective and sinister father. At the same time, Cole slept with Caitlin's mother, Olivia, but he didn't know that Olivia was actually his girlfriend's mother. Various times, Gregory tried to get rid of Cole, even by hiring a hit man to kill him, but he didn't succeed. Thing got even more complicated. At the same time, both Caitlin and Olivia got pregnant. After a car accident, Caitlin lost her baby, but she decided to keep pretending to be pregnant, so she wouldn't lose Cole. Meanwhile, Olivia finally found happiness again with Gregory. Caitlin sought help from Annie Douglas to find a baby that Caitlin could use as her own. At the same time, Annie plotted to win over Gregory, so she decided to make a huge turn-over. When Olivia gave birth, Annie stole the baby and gave it to Caitlin. Olivia thought her baby had died and Caitlin had no idea that she had her mother's child. This, of course caused Gregory and Olivia's divorce. Caitlin and Cole were finally happy. They had a baby and they got married, it seemed like everything was perfect, in the summer of 1998, Cole and Caitlin were also involved in the tsunami storyline. Cole met his former lover, Francesca Vargas and Francesca tried to win him over, but he only loved Caitlin. When Francesca was murdered, they were also suspects, but none of them murdered her, but Gregory is the one who actually killed Francesca. Olivia was shocked to find out that Caitlin's baby is actually her own. Caitlin had hard time dealing with the truth, and this caused a big fight between Cole and Caitlin. Caitlin and Gregory were shocked to learn that Olivia and Cole had an affair years ago. It was then revealed that Cole is actually Trey's father. This led to a fight between Gregory and Cole, after which Gregory went missing and everyone presumed him dead. Caitlin had to struggle with the fact that Trey isn't hers and she was even more shocked when Cole was caught by London authorities, and went missing. He eventually returned in the final episode and reunited with his one/only love, Caitlin.

The award was created in 2007 after being endowed by John Hinde upon his death to commemorate his late wife, author Barbara Jefferis. It is funded by his $1 million bequest. Originally an annual award, it has been awarded biennially since 2012. Jefferis was an Australian writer, and a founding member and first female president of the Australian Society of Authors. She died in 2004.Wyndham (2007) Australian author, Tom Keneally, described Jefferis as \\"a rare being amongst authors, being both a fine writer but also organisationally gifted\\".James Bennett (Firm) The Award, which comprises $50,000 for the winner with $5,000 distributed amongst the shortlist, is one of Australia's richest literary prizes. It is awarded to \\"the best novel written by an Australian author that depicts women and girls in a positive way or otherwise empowers the status of women and girls in society\\". The novel can be in any genre and does not have to be set in Australia. The award does not specify the author's gender. It is administered by the Australian Society of Authors and is expected to rival the Miles Franklin Award ($42,000) and the biennial Tasmania Pacific Fiction Prize ($40,000). The prize was first awarded in 2008 to Rhyll McMaster for Feather Man (Brandl & Schlesinger). Controversy The announcement of the award caused a minor controversy in Australian literary circles due to its target. Susan Wyndham, journalist and literary editor, best summarises the issue in the questions opening her article in The Sydney Morning Herald Blogs: \\"Does Australia need a new fiction award that encourages 'positive' portrayals of women and girls? Or is it an outdated gesture in a post-feminist culture rich with female authors, characters and readers?\\" Wyndham reports Rosalind Hinde, daughter of John Hinde and Barbara Jefferis, as saying that her father had \\"the very clear and strong intention to honour my mother's writing, her feminism and her devotion to other writers\\". Several writers have supported the award, including Tom Keneally, Helen Garner, Frank Moorhouse, Gerald Murnane, Anne Deveson, Kerryn Goldsworthy and Brian Castro. However, writer and critic, Andrew Reimer dislikes the idea of focusing on \\"social agenda\\" over \\"novelist's skill and imagination\\", and novelist Emily McGuire agreed, stating that she doesn't \\"like the idea of judging fiction based on its message\\". Author and critic, Debra Adelaide, expressed her concern that the award might encourage \\"safe and constrained\\" writing and wondered whether \\"we are getting to the point where we have more awards than publishing opportunities\\".

Career McIntyre was born in Geelong in 1910 and graduated from Geelong College as Dux of the School in 1926. He went on to study Arts and Law at the University of Melbourne and on graduation taught at the University from 1931 to 1945. In 1945 he left his teaching position and took on a legal practice in Box Hill, Melbourne and stood for mayor. He won the election and took a special interest in housing cooperatives. For his work as Mayor of Box Hill he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1962 New Year's Day Honours. Note: The record erroneously refers to him as Kenneth George McIntyre On retiring from public office in 1956, McIntyre returned to a passion for Portuguese history and undertook his main work on early Portuguese exploration of Australia. After its publication in 1977, The Secret Discovery of Australia, which revived and expanded on earlier ideas about the possible Portuguese exploration and mapping of Australia in the sixteenth century, quickly became well known and contentious. The Portuguese Government awarded McIntyre the Commander of the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator in 1983 for his work in researching and publicising Portuguese exploration. Following his death in 2004, McIntyre's family donated papers and documents, relating to the Portuguese voyages and the early mapping of the western Pacific, to the manuscript collection at the National Library of Australia.;National Library of Australia MS Acc04/207 McIntyre's interest in mathematics led him to develop a mathematical system for managing the playoff in what was then known as the Victorian Football League (VFL). The algorithm developed by McIntyre determined which teams would compete in the Grand Final. Known as the McIntyre System, it was first implemented in the 1931 VFL season and a version of this system was used by the AFL until 2000. The McIntyre Final Eight System was used by the Australian National Rugby League until 2011, after which it was scrapped by the Independent Commission and replaced with the current AFL finals system from the 2012 NRL season onwards.

Her work spans a variety of media including painting, drawing, etching, tapestry, and ceramic sculpture. Biography She was born in Tel Aviv in 1945 to Itzhak and Fanya Oppenheim. Moritz Daniel Oppenheim was her great- great-granduncle. He was considered “the first Jewish painter” in Europe, very well known and popular in his day. A large exhibition of his works was mounted at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Ilana grew up in Israel, and her art was influenced partly by such Israeli sights as the Negev, the Sinai, the Galilee, and greater Tel Aviv. Ilana always knew, and made known, that art was her calling. From 1980 to 1990, she lived with her family in the art capital of the world, New York, in order to study, renew herself, and broaden her artistic vision. During her stay, from 1980 to 1984 she studied at the Art Students League of New York. Among her teachers were Roberto Delamonica, Bruce Dorfman, and the American master Knox Martin, who was active in New York and was her guide, mentor, and inspiration. Ilana Raviv has exhibited in various museums and galleries of Israel, the US, Europe, and the Far East. Recently Ilana has exhibited her works alongside the best known of artists, including Knox Martin, Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers, Rosenquist, Chuck Close, Marisol, and more. Today she divides her time between Israel and New York. Work Influences Raviv draws her inspiration from works of the ancient past – primitive wall paintings – and ushers them through the ways and spirit of masterworks by Titian, Veronese, Frans Hals, Velásquez, Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso, de Kooning, Knox Martin, and others. Ilana Raviv uses extreme metaphors. She has won the appreciation of art critics around the world. Much of her work focuses on femininity, on the strata of life from childhood to adolescence and from adulthood to partnering, and on relations between the sexes. The great mother figure from Greek mythology is among the chief topics in her work, as are other characters from the Bible, from history, and from literature. Her works are built from a variety of flat designs, contrasts, and shapes, which create different versions and dimensions of reality. Raviv describes her works as \\"a metaphor which creates and shapes an artificial life on canvas\\". In 2008 she received the title of Tel Aviv–Jaffa \\"Woman of the Year\\", representing the arts. Her work is represented in private collections and in various museums and galleries around the world. A solo exhibition consisting of 50 pictures by Ilana was presented at the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg between October 2007 and January 2008, and another solo exhibition of 100 pictures was presented at the Museum of Modern Art Moscow. In both museums, she was the first native Israeli to exhibit. In both museums, the exhibits achieved great success. The State Russian Museum even asked to extend the term of the exhibit in response to popular demand. Both museums called her works comparable in quality to those of the Great Russian artists and the 20th century masters. Besides the Russian museum exhibits, there is a Holocaust-themed painting that has figured for many years in the permanent collection of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. In this painting Ilana exposes the monstrous aspect of the topic more than she trains a direct view on its consequences. The painting shows the Ten Commandments consumed by flame, with an emphasis on \\"Thou shalt not murder.\\" The struggle to survive is expressed only in the mixture of colors. Her painting A Tabernacle of Peace – Homage to Zachariah\\" (acrylic on canvas, 2.12 meters by 10) opened Israel's 40th anniversary celebrations in New York at the world's largest sukkah. Later it was displayed for eight years in the main entrance hall of the Jerusalem International Convention Center. Raviv is married and the mother of three. In the course of her life she has displayed her creations at many exhibits, including a pro bono exhibit to benefit Seeds Of Peace, which aims to inspire and connect Arab and Jewish youth.

Description Conospermum glumaceum grows as an erect shrub without a lignotuber, from 0.5 to 1.7 metres high. It has linear leaves from 1.5 to 7.5 centimetres long and one to five millimetres wide, and panicles of white, cream, yellow or purple flowers. Taxonomy It was first published in John Lindley's 1839 A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony, based on unspecified material. Lindley referred to it as a \\"strange species\\" that \\"has altogether the appearance of some Bupleurum with great membranous bracts.\\" It has since had an uncomplicated taxonomic history, its only synonym being Conospermum lupulinum Endl., which was published by Stephan Endlicher in 1848, but shown to be taxonomically synonymous with C. glumaceum by Eleanor Bennett in 1995, as part of her treatment of Conospermum for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. Distribution and habitat It occurs in lateritic soils amongst hilly terrain, between Eneabba and Red Hill in Western Australia; thus it occurs mainly within the Geraldton Sandplains and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions, with some populations in the Avon Wheatbelt and Jarrah Forest regions. Ecology It is not considered threatened.

He was the producer and financier of many West End plays, and an active member of the Royal Central Asian Society. He was also a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Early life Furness was born in Melton Mowbray, England, the only child of Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness, and his second wife, Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness (formerly Converse, née Morgan), an American socialite and mistress of King Edward VIII while he was still the Prince of Wales. He was the grandson of Christopher Furness, 1st Baron Furness, of Furness Withy Shipping, and a first cousin of the American fashion designer Gloria Vanderbilt. Tony Furness, as he was known, was educated in England at Downside School and in America. He succeeded to the title in 1940 on the death of his father, his half brother Christopher Furness having been killed in action earlier that year at Arras whilst serving with the Welsh Guards for which Christopher Furness was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. House of Lords When Lord Furness came of age, he decided to enter the House of Lords and to take up his responsibilities as second viscount, rather than to live in America, his mother's home country. In the House he served on a series of committees and was, for many years, a mainstay of the Inter Parliamentary Union. In the Lords he sponsored a bill to allow flight passengers the right to a drink out of hours having passed customs. The theatre In addition to his parliamentary duties he also ran Furness Enterprises from his grandfather's offices at 60 St James's Street, which gave him easy access to his favourite clubs. In the fifties and sixties he was a theatrical producer or \\"angel\\", his preferred term, most particularly with the actor Alan Badel, with whom he ran Furndel Productions, based at the Westminster Theatre. Of these productions probably the 1959 production of Ulysses in Nighttown, directed by Burgess Meredith, which transferred from New York and ran in London and later in Paris, and James Saunders' The Ark were the most prestigious; although Furndel productions also mounted the London production of Gore Vidal’s Visit to a Small Planet. When his partnership with Alan Badel ended, he continued to work as a producer, most particularly through his financing of Jeremy Brett's Hamlet, and a memorable production of Heartbreak House at Wyndham's Theatre, with Roger Livesey as Captain Shotover. During these years Lord Furness also had business ventures in America, on occasions with his old Californian school friend Larry Spector, later to be involved in music management and the financing and production of Easy Rider. Mongolia For many years Lord Furness was an active member of the Royal Central Asian Society, now the Royal Society for Asian Affairs. His theatrical and Central Asian interests culminated in his visit to Mongolia in 1960, in an attempt to bring the Mongolian National Opera to London. And although this did not succeed, due largely to difficulties made by the Soviet government of the day, this interest did lead to the founding of The Anglo-Mongolian Society in 1963. Sovereign Military Order of Malta Grave stone of Furness, Kensal Green Cemetery, London, with Maltese Cross referring to his position as a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In addition to his work in business and in the theatre, Lord Furness was, from his early adult life, a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Catholic Church was an extremely important part of his life, thus his work for the order was something he took very seriously. Eventually he became one of the first two English Professed Knights of the Order since the reformation, the other being the late grandmaster of the Order of Malta, HMEH Fra Andrew Bertie. On becoming a professed knight Lord Furness focused all his efforts on working for the Order and left England to reside in Martigny, as a tax exile. He spent much time in Geneva, Switzerland, where he maintained an office. Death He died in the Order's Hospice of St John and St Elizabeth in London on 1 May 1995. Since he did not marry and had no children—according to an obituary, he took a vow of celibacy upon being rejected by the only woman he ever asked to marry him, Joyce Reeves – both titles became extinct.

It was created by veteran volunteers from the Winter War who had fought on the Finnish side against the Soviet Union. It was among the largest Danish resistance groups and consisted of around 350 volunteers towards the end of the war. The group carried out about 100 sabotage operations and was responsible for around 200 executions of informers who had revealed the identity and/or the whereabouts of members of the resistance. The group was named after the legendary Danish hero Holger Danske. History The group was formed in Copenhagen in 1942 by five men who had all fought on the Finnish side during the Winter War. By this time of the occupation, resistance work carried a great deal of risk because the general public was still largely opposed to sabotage and the government was following its \\"co-operation\\" policy with the Nazis to keep German intervention in Danish affairs to a minimum. Holger Danske, as well as the rest of the Danish resistance, was very much opposed to this collaboration and continued to believe that the Danes should have resisted the invasion much more fiercely. Gunnar Dyrberg recalls in his memoir how he had seen Danes engage in friendly conversation with the Germans immediately after the invasion and cites this as one of the reasons he later decided to join Holger Danske, with the code name Bob Herman. A fuller account of his activities as a liquidator are described in his autobiographical book De ensomme Ulve (The Lonely Wolves). The group was infiltrated by the Gestapo twice but because of its loose structure (unlike BOPA) they were unable to identify all the members. A total of 64 members were executed by the Gestapo during the occupation. Among their largest sabotage actions were the blowing up of the Forum Arena in 1943 and the attack on Burmeister & Wain in 1944.  Members  Two of the members of Holger Danske were Jørgen Haagen Schmith and Bent Faurschou-Hviid, who became famous under their aliases, Citronen (the Lemon) and Flammen (the Flame). Both led numerous sabotage operations in 1943 and 1944. They were portrayed in the 2008 movie Flammen og Citronen by Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikkelsen. One member of the group, Lis Mellemgaard, survived the war as she remained at home with a sore throat when her colleagues were rounded up and executed in March 1945. The author Arne Sørensen was a member of the group. After the war, he was involved in the nation's reconstruction as a politician.Arne Sørensen from Nomos website. Retrieved 18 April 2008.

Musical styles In the beginning, Hideki had a huge influence on Acid and they played a mix of alternative metal and emo with emphasis placed on his and Junpei's twin vocals. After he left the band in 2005, their songs became less focused on vocals and turned a bit more pop-ish, but still kept their \\"heavy\\" sound due to having three guitarists. History Acid formed in August 2003 through auditions held by Hideki. Their live setlist was made up of both of Hideki's solo albums at the beginning and, after one year of excessive touring through Japan, the group went into the studio at the end of 2004 to record their first album. Acid 1.5: Punk Drunker was released in March 2005. With the end of Siam Shade, Hideki didn't want people to always compare his new band with the old one when he was singing. That's why he drew back to the position behind the keyboard at first and later on left Acid completely in June 2005 so that the band were able to go their own way. Furthermore, he says that this group is his pride and that he'd like to see them in Tokyo Dome one day. However, after losing a few more members (Kim left in 2006 to join the mandatory military services back in Korea, Junpei left in 2008 due to health problems, along with Masamitsu who left for unknown reasons), the three remaining members decided to disband and create a new band.

Following defeat at the Battle of Wagram, Archduke Charles retreated north into Bohemia hoping to regroup his battered forces. The French army had also suffered in the battle and did not give immediate pursuit. But two days after the battle, Napoleon ordered his troops north intending to defeat the Austrians once and for all. The French eventually caught up the Austrians at Znaim (now Znojmo, Czech Republic) on 10 July 1809. Realising they were in no position to give battle, the Austrians proposed a ceasefire as Archduke Charles went to begin peace negotiations with Napoleon. However, Marshal Auguste de Marmont refused to observe the ceasefire and committed his XI Corps of around 10,000 men into battle. With Marmont greatly outnumbered, André Masséna had no choice but to support him. By 11 July, Masséna's corps had joined Marmont's in battle but the Austrians had also reinforced their position around Znaim. After two days of futile fighting, with both sides suffering similar casualties and neither side gaining any advantage, Napoleon finally arrived with news of an armistice and ordered Marmont to end the battle. Although the Battle of Znaim was the last action between Austria and France in the war, a formal peace was not agreed until the Treaty of Schönbrunn was signed on 14 October 1809, which finally ended the War of the Fifth Coalition. Prelude The immediate cause of the two-day Battle of Znaim was the decision of the Austrian commander in chief, Archduke Charles, to stage a rearguard action near the town of Znaim, about 80 kilometers north of Vienna, in order to give his army time to withdraw its baggage train in safety toward Moravia. Marmont’s two combined French and Bavarian corps were the first of Napoleon’s troops to arrive on the field following the course of the river Thaya. Believing that he faced only a rear guard, Marmont ordered his Bavarian troops to take the village of Tesswitz south of Znaim, while the rest of his troops attacked the village of Zuckerhandl.Ralph Baker in The Encyclopedia of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars by Gregory Fremont-Barnes (main editor) (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2006) 1111-1112. Battle The Bavarians succeeded in storming Tesswitz but were then thrown out by Austrian reinforcements. Marmont renewed the Bavarian attack, and Tesswitz was retaken, only to be lost soon after. The village changed hands a number of times during the day, this contest constituting the heaviest fighting the Bavarians saw in the whole campaign. Marmont had hoped to swing his cavalry in behind the Austrian rear guard, but on reaching high ground above Tesswitz, they were faced with five enemy corps. The French cavalry was forced to withdraw in the face of a large body of Austrian cuirassiers. Marmont was now engaged by 40,000 Austrian troops and was heavily outnumbered. His men nevertheless managed to hold on to both Tesswitz and Zuckerhandl overnight. Archduke Charles withdrew his forces into a strong defensive position situated so as to hold the north bank of the Thaya and Znaim. Napoleon arrived at Tesswitz at 10:00 A.M., and despite the fact that he had brought with him reinforcements of cavalry and artillery, he believed that his force was too weak to launch a full-scale attack. His plan therefore was to employ Masséna’s corps to pin the Austrians throughout the day and to await the corps of marshals Louis-Nicolas Davout and Nicolas Oudinot, which would be able to arrive early on the twelfth. Masséna launched his attack on the extreme right of the Austrian position during midmorning and quickly seized the main bridge across the Thaya south of Znaim. His troops took two small villages and then advanced directly on Znaim. Charles meanwhile reinforced the Austrian position with two grenadier brigades, which advanced during a thunderstorm and initially threw the French back. The situation was stabilized by a body of French cavalry at approximately 7:00 P.M., when French and Austrian staff officers rode along the opposing lines announcing a cease-fire, which led to the signature of an armistice on the twelfth. Znaim was to prove the last action of the 1809 campaign. The two sides signed a treaty of peace at the Schönbrunn Palace on 14 October.

Biography Faville, a Republican, served as the first Lieutenant Governor of Iowa from 1858 to 1860 under fellow Republican, Governor Ralph P. Lowe. He was also later an Iowa superintendent of public instruction (1864–1867). He was the last secretary of the state board of education before the title of the office was changed to \\"superintendent of public instruction\\", and then was the first person to serve in the office under its new titular style. He was also the first county judge of Mitchell County, Iowa in 1851. Despite its title, the office was predominantly an executive one; the county judge ran the county much in the manner that the modern Board of Supervisors does today. Fanville was born in Mannheim, Herkimer County, New York, great- grandson of Captain John Faville, shown on the Continental rolls as in command at Fishkill, New York, during the American Revolution. Faville was educated at Wesleyan University. He then taught school in New York and Vermont. Later, he was a professor at McKendree College and the president of the Ohio Wesleyan Female College in Delaware, Ohio. In the 1850s, he moved to Mitchell County, Iowa and entered politics.Biographical Sketch of Oran Faville After his death, he was interred at Oak Grove Cemetery in Mitchell County.

According to his obituary in The Guardian, his life could have provided the storyline for one of the musicals he starred in. Career Edmund Hockridge grew up on a farm in the Vancouver area of British Columbia. His mother was a pianist and his father and three brothers - all older than he was - loved to sing. When Edmund was 17, a Vancouver music club organised an audition with New York Metropolitan Opera star John Charles Thomas, who encouraged him to look to music as a career. Going overseas during World War II with the Royal Canadian Air Force led to Hockridge being \\"loaned\\" to the BBC, in a unit supplying news and entertainment to the troops in Europe, working with the Glenn Miller Orchestra and the Canadian Band of the Allied Expeditionary Force led by Robert Farnon. Hockridge learned much of his craft as an entertainer at the radio (mike), singing and producing 400 shows for the BBC Forces Network and, as the war ended, he was snapped up for appearances with the big names in British popular music, Gerald Bright (better known as Geraldo) and George Melachrino among them. Whilst serving in Britain he met a Wren, Eileen Elliott, who worked in Lord Louis Mountbatten's office. They married and had a son, but Hockridge believed that they had fallen into marriage rather than love, and by the time he returned to Canada it was clear that the relationship was doomed. After the war, he had his own coast-to-coast radio show from Toronto with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in whose Gilbert and Sullivan productions he played all thirteen patter-song roles. He was also developing a career in opera, taking leading roles in Don Giovanni, La Boheme and Peter Grimes. His big break, in 1950, came with the chance to play Billy Bigelow in Rodgers and Hammerstein's Carousel at the Theatre Royal in London's Drury Lane. This marked the beginning of 40 years in showbusiness in the United Kingdom. Carousel was also to change Hockridge's personal life. In the cast was a 19-year-old dancer, Jackie Jefferson. The couple chose to keep their affair low-key, eventually marrying after his first wife agreed to a divorce. They moved to Peterborough (where they lived next door to Ernie Wise) and brought up a family. In 1951 he went back on British radio, while continuing to do his stage performances. After three years and nearly 1300 performances, he joined the American cast of Guys and Dolls when they brought the show to London, in the role of Sky Masterson. Hockridge went on to make two more musical roles his own - Judge Forestier, in Can-Can, and Sid Sorokin in the original London production of The Pajama Game, an instant hit with the British public. His hit single, \\"Hey There\\", from what quickly became a hit show, ensured that his name became more well-known. Seven years of musicals were followed by public appearances, concerts, pantomimes, Royal Command Performances, London Palladium seasons, summer shows, television dates in the UK, Canada and Europe and some special occasions - topping the bill on the maiden voyage of the QE2 to New York and representing Canada in the choir at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II among them. Cabaret bookings took Hockridge to the Stanley Hotel in Nairobi, and the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong, and he recorded singles, EPs and eleven albums. In October 1968, Hockridge appeared on BBC Television's Morecambe & Wise Show. Coincidentally, he lived with second wife Jackie Jefferson in Peterborough, in the house next door to Ernie Wise. In 1986, aged 67, he partnered the rock singer Suzi Quatro in a London production of Annie Get Your Gun (his seventh musical) and also appeared with Isla St Clair in a provincial production of The Sound of Music (1984). He continued to perform on stage regularly, latterly with his family, until his retirement. Recordings His first recording, \\"Serenade\\" (1950) on UK Decca Records, was followed by three releases on HMV, none of which sold very well. Then in 1953 he switched to Parlophone, making recordings of songs from Guys and Dolls, Carousel, and Can-Can. In 1955 he went back to HMV, while still doing songs from the same musicals that saw him as an actor: in this case, \\"Hey There\\" from The Pajama Game. Finally, in 1956, he switched to Pye Nixa, the record label which brought him his first hits. His second Nixa recording was a cover of Tennessee Ernie Ford's \\"Sixteen Tons,\\" with a cover of Dean Martin's \\"Young and Foolish\\" on the flip side. Whilst Ford's version of \\"Sixteen Tons\\" outdid Hockridge's, his version of \\"Young and Foolish\\" was a Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart. He followed this record with a revival of \\"No Other Love,\\" which was another hit on the UK chart. He had one final entry on the chart with \\"By the Fountains of Rome\\" in September 1957. After that, he continued to record for Pye Nixa, though not charting again in the UK. Death Hockridge died on 15 March 2009, at the age of 89, in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. He is survived by his widow Jackie, their sons Murray and Stephen, a foster son, Clifford, and Ian, his son from his first marriage to Eileen Elliott.

Menshikov Palace can also refer to the Lefort Palace in Moscow. It was the first stone building in the city. Since 1981, it has served as a public museum, a branch of the Hermitage Museum. The palace was founded in 1710 as a residence of Saint Petersburg Governor General Alexander Menshikov and built by Italian architects Giovanni Maria Fontana, and, later, German architect Gottfried Johann Schädel. It was opened in 1711, but the construction continued until 1727 (assisted by Domenico Trezzini, Bartolomeo Rastrelli, Georg Johann Mattarnovy and Jean-Baptiste Le Blond), when Menshikov with his family was exiled to Siberia and his property was confiscated. In 1731 the First Cadet Corps were established and occupied the palace and neighboring buildings. At the end of the 19th century the Menshikov Palace was restored and became the museum of the Corps. In 1924, its collections were moved to the Hermitage and other museums. From 1956-1981 the Menshikov Palace was restored again and finally opened to the public as a branch of the Hermitage Museum with a collection of Russian art of the late 17th-early 18th century.

It is located in the Kontorhaus District. It is an exceptional example of the 1920s Brick Expressionism style of architecture. This large angular building is located on a site of approximately 6,000m², spanning the Fischertwiete Street in Hamburg. It was designed by the German architect Fritz Höger and finished in 1924. Design Chilehaus: Inner courtyard The Chilehaus building is famed for its top, which is reminiscent of a ship's prow, and the facades, which meet at a very sharp angle at the corner of the Pumpen- and Niedernstrasse. The best view of the building is from the east. Because of the accentuated vertical elements and the recessed upper stories, as well as the curved facade on the Pumpen street, the building has, despite its enormous size, a touch of lightness. The building has a reinforced concrete structure and has been built with the use of 4.8 million dark Oldenburg bricks.Thiel-Siling, Sabine (ed.): Icons of Architecture\\", Prestel, 1998, The building is constructed on very difficult terrain, so to gain stability it was necessary to build on 16-meter-deep reinforced-concrete pilings. The location's close vicinity to the Elbe River necessitated a specially sealed cellar, and heating equipment was constructed in a caisson that can float within the building, so the equipment can't be damaged in the event of flooding. The sculptural elements in the staircases and on the facade were provided by the sculptor Richard Kuöhl. The building hosts one of the few remaining working paternoster lifts in the world. History The Chilehaus building was designed by the architect Fritz Höger and built between 1922 and 1924. It was commissioned by the shipping magnate Henry B. Sloman, who made his fortune trading saltpeter from Chile, hence the name Chile House. The cost of construction is difficult to determine, as the Chile House was built during the period of hyperinflation that struck Germany during the early 1920s, but is estimated to have been more than 10 million reichsmark. Currently it is property of the German real-estate company Union Investment Real Estate AG. The Hamburg site of the Instituto Cervantes is one of the renters.

In the 5th century BC a bronze version began to appear in Ancient Greece and during the Hellenistic era and it became a popular infantry helmet. It occasionally had a horsehair crest. The Greek () and Latin were smaller versions, similar to a skullcap. The plis, an Albanian felt cap, originated from a similar felt cap worn by the Illyrians, and is worn today in Albania and Kosovo. History Ancient Greek terracotta statuette of a peasant wearing a pilos, 1st century BC  Greece  The pilos (Greek: πῖλος, feltπῖλος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus) was a typical conical hat in Ancient Greece among travelers, workmen and sailors, though sometimes a low, broad-rimmed version was also preferred, known as petasos. It could be made of felt or leather. Pilos caps often identify the mythical twins, or Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, as represented in sculptures, bas-reliefs and on ancient ceramics. Their caps were supposedly the remnants of the egg from which they hatched.John Tzetzes, On Lycophron, noted by Karl Kerenyi's The Heroes of the Greeks, 1959:107 note 584. The pilos appears on votive figurines of boys at the sanctuary of the Cabeiri at Thebes, the Cabeirion.Walter Burkert. Greek Religion, 1985:281. In warfare, the pilos type helmet was often worn by the peltast light infantry, in conjunction with the exomis, but it was also worn by the heavy infantry. The pilos helmet was made of bronze in the same shape as the pilos which was presumably sometimes worn under the helmet for comfort, giving rise to the helmet's conical shape.Nick Sekunda,The Spartan Army, p.30 Some historians theorize that the pilos helmet had widespread adoption in some Greek cities such as Sparta,Jesse Obert, A Brief History of Greek Helmets, p.16 however, there is no primary historical source or any archeological evidence that would suggest that Sparta or any other Greek state would have used the helmet in a standardized fashion for their armies. What led historians to believe that the helmet was widespread in places such as Sparta was, amongst other reasons, the supposed advancement of battlefield tactics that required that infantry have full vision and mobility.Jesse Obert, A Brief History of Greek Helmets, p.16 However, many other types of Greek helmet offered similar designs to the pilos when it came to visibility, such as the konos or the chalcidian helmets, and the idea that Sparta widely adopted the pilos helmet, or any type of helmet in a standard fashion, is based purely on speculation, since any surviving records of classical historians such as Herodotus or Xenophon never gave such an account of a precise type of widespread equipment or helmet the greeks wore at any point in time. Illyria The plis, an Albanian felt cap, originated from a similar felt cap worn by the Illyrians.Fortson, Benjamin W. (2004). Indo-European language and culture: an introduction (5th ed.). Wiley-Blackwell. . The cap is part of the traditional costume of the Albanian and is considered as a national symbol among a large number of Albanian communities.Andromaqi Gjergji (2004).

The qeleshe, the white felt cap worn by men, was a distinctively Albanian type of headgear both within the country and beyond its frontiers\\" [...] \\"Among the mountain people of the north it was hemispherical in form; at Kukés in the form of a truncated cone In southern Albania, the cap is taller than in northern Albania, especially in the Gjirokastër and Vlorë regions, with the exception of the Myzeqe low plains region. In some areas of southern Albania the cap has a small protrusion. The cap is made from one single piece of woolen felt, usually white, that is molded to the shape of the head.Gillian Gloyer (2012). Bradt Albania. Bradt Travel Guides. p. 49. . Retrieved 14 April 2013. The best place in Albania to shop for souvenirs is Kruja, where all the shops are close together in the bazaar. There are traditional felt-makers, who produce slippers and the felt caps called qeleshe Rome reverse of a denarius issued by Brutus to commemorate the assassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March In Ancient Rome, a slave was freed in a ceremony in which a praetor touched the slave with a rod called a vindicta and pronounced him to be free. The slave's head was shaved and a pileus was placed upon it. Both the vindicta and the cap were considered symbols of Libertas, the goddess representing liberty. This was a form of extra-legal manumission (the manumissio minus justa) considered less legally sound than manumission in a court of law. One 19th century dictionary of classical antiquity states that, \\"Among the Romans the cap of felt was the emblem of liberty. When a slave obtained his freedom he had his head shaved, and wore instead of his hair an undyed pileus.\\"πίλεον λευκόν, Diodorus Siculus Exc. Leg. 22 p. 625, ed. Wess.; Plaut. Amphit. I.1.306; Persius, V.82 Hence the phrase servos ad pileum vocare is a summons to liberty, by which slaves were frequently called upon to take up arms with a promise of liberty (Liv. XXIV.32). The figure of Liberty on some of the coins of Antoninus Pius, struck A.D. 145, holds this cap in the right hand.Yates, James. Entry \\"Pileus\\" in William Smith's A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (John Murray, London, 1875). In the period of the Tetrarchy and subsequently a distinctive type of round, brimless hat known as the Pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus) was worn as part of a Roman soldier's costume, though it also seems to have been worn by non-military bureaucrats. It was flat topped and resembled the more recent 'pillbox hat'.Sumner and D'Amato, 37 Gallery File:Bronze helmet of conical shape MET DP21094.jpg|Ancient Greek pilos type helmet, 450–425 BC File:Rhesos MNA Naples.jpg|Odysseus wearing the pilos.

The Faddey Islands (Russian: Острова Фаддея; Ostrova Faddeya) is a group of islands in the Laptev Sea, Russia. Geography The Faddey Islands group is located in the coastal region, off Faddey Bay (залив Фаддея) in the coast of Siberia, east of the Taymyr Peninsula. The Main islands are: * Ostrov Faddeyya-Severnyy, coordinates . * Ostrov Faddeyya-Vostochnyy, coordinates . * Ostrov Faddeyya- Yuzhnyy, coordinates . * Ostrov Kapitanskiy, a smaller island, located off the main cluster and closer to the shore, . The islands are covered with tundra vegetation, shingle and ice. The sea around these Islands is covered with fast ice in the winter and the climate is severe. The surrounding sea is obstructed by pack ice even in the summer. The Faddey Islands were named after Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, which is \\"Faddey Faddeyevich Bellinsgauzen\\" in Russian. This island group belongs to the Krasnoyarsk Krai administrative division of Russia. History Ancient stone implements, probably shaped by man, were found on the Faddey Islands and were studied by the Russian archaeologist A.P. Okladnikov, an expert in the ancient cultures of Siberia and the Pacific Basin. In 1940-41 Soviet hydrographers found the remains of people, money, weapons and other items on these islands and in the nearby coast of the Simsa Bay. Apparently these were traces of an expedition undertaken by Akaky and Ivan Muromets in the early 17th century. A.P.Okladnikov, who studied these findings in 1945, supposed that the people went there from the west, from the Yenisei River (Historical monument…, 1945). However, in the 1980s hydrographer V.A.Troitsky put forward a different theory. According to his point of view the deceased seafarers tried to sail by sea from the Khatanga Gulf to the mouth of the Yenisei on two ships in order to load furs (Troitsky, 1991). But the first ship was crushed by ice in the area of the Faddey Islands. Even though the crew were able to reach the land, none of them managed to survive. The second ship reached the Simsa Bay, where the crew built a house in order to leave three ill people there. Then the ship made its way to the south, and four people seem to have been able to reach populated places. Since 1993 these islands are part of the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve of Russia.Great Arctic State Nature Reserve References * Russian explorations * Polar Record, Scott Polar Research Institute. * Soviet Geography, Accomplishments and Tasks.

Brown was born in Angus, Scotland, in 1809 or 1810. He moved to New Zealand on 2 February 1840, arriving in the Bay of Islands. Business career He made friends with Logan Campbell on the voyage and they became business partners in New Zealand. They bought Motukorea, to become known as Browns Island, near Auckland, from Ngāti Tamaterā on 22 May 1840 and moved there on 13 August. Brown moved to Auckland in early 1841 and on 19 April 1841 he and Campbell bought a section in Shortland Crescent, where they built Acacia Cottage, the Browns' home, and a store. Acacia Cottage still exists and is now located in Cornwall Park. The firm of Brown and Campbell was very successful, working as auctioneers, shipping agents, importers, and traders with the Maori.  Publisher of The Southern Cross and The Daily Southern Cross William Brown started The Southern Cross newspaper as a weekly paper in 1843. In 1862 it became a daily newspaper, with a change of name to The Daily Southern Cross. The editorial policy was to support the land claimants, such as the New Zealand Company, and the newspaper vigorously attacked Governor George Grey's administration. The Flagstaff War adversely affected business in Auckland, such that The Southern Cross, stop publishing from April 1845 to July 1847. Member of Parliament He became the Member of Parliament in the 1st Parliament for the City of Auckland from a by-election held on 4 August 1854, when he replaced Thomas Bartley, who had resigned. He retired on 15 September 1855 at the end of the Parliament's first term, and did not seek re-election. He was elected the second Superintendent of Auckland Province in 1855.

To the west, it is bounded by North Main Street, the North Burial Ground, and Interstate 95, while Rochambeau Ave, Hope Street, and the Providence-Pawtucket city line roughly delineate its boundaries to the south, east, and north respectively. Hope is sometimes referred to as \\"Summit\\", named for the street that runs through the middle of the neighborhood. Though \\"Hope\\" is officially recognized, residents and the local neighborhood organization more often use \\"Summit\\". History The area that is now Hope was first settled in the seventeenth century by farmers and tavernkeepers following present-day North Main Street out of the center of Providence, establishing a strong rural community. Like many of Providence's neighborhoods, Hope did not experience appreciable development until the area was connected to downtown Providence by streetcar, happening in 1875. Large farming lots gave way to subdivision and the establishment of single-family homes. In the 1920s, many of these were bought by a growing community of Russian Jews who would have a strong presence in the area until World War II. In 1945, Miriam Hospital relocated to Hope from its West End lot. Having expanded four times since then and opening a new medical building in 1989, the hospital now occupies a full two city blocks, with a parking lot filling out the third, now stretching from 5th Street to 8th Street. Today, a community organization named the Summit Neighborhood Association publishes a quarterly newspaper and encourages participation in neighborhood activities. Demographics As of 1990 Census, the neighborhood was home to 3464 individuals and was roughly 80% non-Hispanic white, 8.2% black, 4% Hispanic, 2% Asian or pacific islander with the remaining 6% either reporting other or multiple races. Median household income was $47,764, above the citywide average of $26,867. Approximately 5% of families were living below the poverty line, compared with 24% for the city as a whole. About 40% of housing stock were single-family units, with the remaining being duplex or multi-family units. The median price for a single-family house was $247,500, nearly twice the citywide average of $130,000. Owner-occupancy has been steadily dropping, from 56% in 1980 to 48% in 1990.

Munírih K͟hánum (; 1847April 28, 1938) was the wife of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, a prominent figure in the Baháʼí Faith. She was entitled the Holy Mother. Her memoirs, first published in 1924, are regarded as one of the first published memoirs by a Persian woman in the 20th century.  Childhood and early years  Munírih Khánum was born Fáṭimih Nahrí, the eldest child of Muhammad ʻAlí Nahrí and his wife, Zahrá of Isfahán in Isfahan. The Nahrí family were a prominent family in the city, and her family were one of the first Bábís of Isfahan who later became eminent Baháʼís of Persia. The family were also highly connected with high-ranking nobles and clerics of the city. Her maternal uncle was killed at the age of fourteen in Persia because of his religion. Munírih's birth came as a surprise to her parents. Her father was previously married and had no issue and upon his wives death, he remarried Zahrá Khánum. Munírih's birth in 1847 did not occur until some ten years after the parents marriage, when the couple had assumed they would never have children. Education Her father was one of the first Bábís in her city of birth, and Munírih was brought up as a devout Bábí and later Baháʼí under her parents care. Though it was customary not to educate girls, even of noble birth, her father had his daughter educated and she was a fine writer and poet. Her poetry was reported to be beautiful and she wrote many during her marriage and later years. Munírih was also fluent in her native Persian and also Arabic and Turkish. She was also well versed in Persian literature, in the works of Rumi and Nizami which she refers to in her later writings. According to her later memoirs her father died shortly after her eleventh birthday and she was left to the care of both her maternal and paternal extended families. First marriage As a young woman, Munírih was regarded as a suitable match for marriage to Baháʼí families throughout Persia. However, in her infancy as was the Persian custom her parents had betrothed her to a young man. Some time after the death of her father, her family thought she had come of age for a marriage. They arranged that she be wedded to the young Mírzá Kázim, the youngest brother of the King and Beloved of Martyrs. Munírih was reluctant at first, but due to familiar pressure she begrudgingly consented to the marriage despite her misgivings. The two were married in an extravagant wedding with the crescendo being the young couple led to the bedchamber. However, Mírzá Kázim fell ill during the wedding ceremony and avoided his bride. The same night he left the house to the horror and consternation of his family. After six months his maid found him dead in the home of the young couple. Munírih was humiliated and overwhelmed. Perplexed, she resolved she would never marry again, instead she spent her days in prayer and meditation.  Marriage  ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as a young man. In 1871, Baháʼu'lláh and Navváb expressed interest in Munírih to become the wife of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and she made a wearisome journey to Acre, Israel. The sister of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá says that her parents wanted Munírih because she was \\"very beautiful and amiable, and in every way a suitable match\\". The parents of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had believed that it was time for him to marry, and though several young women were thought of as potential brides ʻAbdu'l-Bahá explained that he did not want to marry. Munírih's journey began with the departure from Isfahan with the company of her younger brother. She then went on pilgrimage to the house of the Báb and visited the wife of the Báb, Khadíjih-Bagum. Khadíjih related a great number of stories to Munírih about the life of the Báb. She became acquainted with the Báb's family members too (most of which were resentful or indifferent to his religion). The trip to Shiraz was a great delight to the young Munírih. She arrived in mid-1872 and lived in the house of Mírzá Músá for the time of the betrothal. Munírih later reminisced how she fell instantly in love with the young ʻAbdu'l-Bahá when they met one another. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had showed little inclination of marriage until he met 24-year- old Munírih Khánum in 1872. After five months betrothal the couple were finally married. Baháʼu'lláh entitled Fáṭimih with the name Munírih (Illumined). The couple married on March 8, 1873 in the house of ʻAbbúd. Munírih K͟hánum was twenty-five, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was twenty-eight. The marriage was a happy union. They had nine children: Ḥusayn Effendi (d. 1305/1887, aged five), Mihdí (died aged two-and-a-half), Ṭúbá (died sometime in Akka), Fu'ádíyyih (died in infancy), and Ruḥangíz (died in 1893, she was the favorite grandchild of Baháʼu'lláh) \\"five of my children died in the poisonous climate of 'Akká\\" she later bitterly reflected. Four children survived adulthood – all daughters; Ḍíyáʼíyyih K͟hánum (mother of Shoghi Effendi) (d. 1951) Túbá K͟hánum (1880–1959) Rúḥá K͟hánum and Munavvar K͟hánum (d. 1971).Family tree of Mirza Buzurg Nuri Munírih Khánum was very emotionally attached to her children and devoted to her husband. Family The oldest of these was Ḍíyáʼíyyih, who married Mírzá Hádí Shírází (1864–1955) in 1895; their children were Shoghi Effendi, Rúḥangíz, Mihrangíz, Ḥusayn, and Riyáḍ, who all took the surname Rabbání. The second daughter, Ṭúbá Khánum, married Mírzá Muḥsin Afnán (1863–1927); their children were Rúḥí (1899–1971), Thurayyá, Suhayl, and Fu'ád (d. 1943), who all took the surname Afnán. The third daughter of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, Rúḥá, married Mírzá Jalál, the son of Mírzá Muḥammad Ḥasan, King of Martyrs; their children were Maryam (d.1933), Muníb, Zahrá and Ḥasan, who all took the surname Shahíd. The fourth daughter, Munavvar, married Mírzá Aḥmad, the son of Mírzá ʻAbdu'r-Raḥím Yazdí; they were childless. In the 1930s and 1940s a series of marriages linked the sons of Sayyid 'Alí Afnán and Furúghíyyih, who had been supporters of Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí, with the grandchildren of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. As a result of these marriages, other inappropriate marriages, or refusal to break ties with Covenant-breakers in the family, Shoghi Effendi, in the 1940s and early 1950s, reluctantly declared all the surviving grandchildren of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá (except himself) Covenant-breakers.  Life in a prison city  Home of Munírih and her family. During Baháʼu'lláh's lifetime In the 1870s, Munírih and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá lived in the House of ʻAbbúd in the prison city of Akko as political prisoners. Though technically not a prisoner under the Ottoman Empire, she nevertheless was married to one which put her safety in risk. She grew a close attachment with the mother of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, Navváb and with his sister Bahíyyih Khánum who became her closest friend. The four, along with their brood of children all lived together in the house of ʻAbbúd. The imprisonment was trying times for Munírih Khánum. She witnessed the machinations of her husband's enemies and the death of five of her nine children. The death of her most beloved child, a son named Husayn, caused her unbearable grief and anguish. To console her Baháʼu'lláh wrote a number of prayers for her to read in times of sadness. Husayn's death came at a bad time, as the previous year Navvab had died from a fall, and in 1888 Baháʼu'lláh's brother Mírzá Músá also died. The death of Baháʼu'lláh in 1892 caused hardship for ʻAbdu'l-Bahá again and his family, after all of his half-siblings turned against him and Munírih too. Appointment of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as Head of the Faith In the Kitáb-i-ʻAhd (\\"Book of the Covenant\\"), Baháʼu'lláh named ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as his successor and head of the Baháʼí Faith. However, Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí, the half brother of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, was resentful at the authority of his brother. He began a secret correspondence with Baháʼís of Iran and Ottoman authorities allegedly stating that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had claimed a station equal to a Manifestation of God and was conspiring with foreign authorities to overthrow the Ottoman Empire. Consequently, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's whole family was in danger. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá quietly went for a short trip to the Tiberias leaving Munírih and her family in Akko. Munírih mourned the separation from her husband. Furthermore, restrictions placed upon women added further hardship. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote to his wife: The restrictions culminated in the family not able to attend affairs outside of the home. A male figure was needed. A member of the Afnan family of which Baháʼu'lláh had kept in high regard was proposed as a match for Munírih's eldest daughter was proposed. Therefore, her daughter Ḍíyáʼ Khánum was married to Hádí Shírází Afnán in 1895. The young couple were the parents of Shoghi Effendi. Munírih Khánum relied heavily on the support of her sister-in-law Bahíyyih Khánum and the two shared a deeply close friendship. The two also stood firmly beside ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in times of difficulty. Western pilgrims However, there were happy times for the family too. The birth of her first grandchild Shoghi Effendi in 1897 offered comfort for the family and he was doted on. In late 1898 the first pilgrims from the West arrived in Akko to visit ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. Munírih Khánum also became acquainted with them, and she mostly spent her time with the female pilgrims (though Baháʼí teachings emphasize the equality of the sexes, the Baháʼís of the time had to uphold local customs for the sake of harmony). The pilgrimage bought happiness into the family's life after the harsh previous years. The years followed with a flood of pilgrims from both the East and West, of which Munírih and Bahíyyih Khánum looked after. Danger The influx of Western pilgrims offered happiness for the family. However, with the outbreak of World War I the family became almost severed from the world wide Baháʼí community. Trying times followed, especially with Jamal Pasha becoming an enemy of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá who promised to crucify him on Mount Carmel. The enemies of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had united with Jamal Pasha to slay him. His family were all aware of the grim future, that Sultán ʻAbdu'l-Hamíd's desired to banish ʻAbdu'l-Bahá to the deserts of North Africa where he was expected to perish. Munírih Khánum suffered emotionally and physically from this news, and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá sent her outside of Akko for a break from the stress. News of these threats affected the prosecution of the war in the Palestine theatre (see Battle of Megiddo (1918)) and with the defeat of Jamal Pasha ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was safe as was his family.  Death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá  In 1921, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá died unexpectedly. Munírih was devastated at the loss of her husband; they had been married for nearly 50 years. She poured her grief in several letters and poems which she composed. In one letter she wrote following the one-year anniversary of her husband's death she writes \\"should I wish to describe fully this miserable year...I would need seventy reams of paper, and seas of blood.\\" She did console herself with Bahíyyih Khánum and the other mourners, such as Lady Blomfield, who records the aftermath of his death in her famous book The Chosen Highway. Munírih also firmly backed Shoghi Effendi after he was named head of the religion following the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. In a letter dated December 1924 Munírih, writes to her grandson calling him her \\"pearl\\" and beloved. She asks him to pray that she dies peacefully and in \\"absolute detachment and utter sincerity.\\" Munírih was a passionate patroness in funding education for girls. Lady Blomfield described Munírih K͟hánum as \\"a majestic woman, stately yet simple, with an innate dignity and strength of character\\". Putting much of her energy towards women, she worked to try to open schools for girls and encouraged the Baháʼís of Persia to include women in Baháʼí activities. In one letter she wrote, \\"thus the education of girls is a matter of the greatest importance and is regarded as an obligatory law. Hence, the friends of the All-Merciful, and the beloved maidservants of the Lord, in all cities and countries must take action and endeavor to their utmost capacity to carry out this weighty injunction.\\" The death of Munírih's confidante and closest friend Bahíyyih Khánum in 1932 was a further blow, after which she secluded herself from society. Describing her sorrow, she wrote in a poem, \\"I can endure no more. My patience is ended. My powers have declined. I live on Mount Carmel friendless and alone.\\" She did, however, show great fondness and affection to her eldest grandson and head of the Baháʼí Faith, Shoghi Effendi, and remained faithful to the Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh despite years of infighting within Baháʼu'lláh's family that saw many of them expelled from the religion.  Death  Munírih K͟hánum died in April 1938 aged 91. Shoghi Effendi cabled the Baháʼís: She is buried near the vicinity of the Shrine of the Báb in the Monument Gardens at the Baháʼí World Centre.

March 6, 2013. Accessed May 9, 2015. The image on the first edition is a self- portrait drawn by the author. Plot summary Twenty-nine year old Alaric Darconville takes a position as an English instructor at Quinsy College, a women's college at Quinsyburg, Virginia. Born in New England, he is the descendant of notable nobility with a French and Italian pedigree, among them a Pierre Christophe Cardinal Theroux-d’Arconville (a chapter is devoted to him) and Marie Genevieve Charlotte Theroux-d’Arconville (p. 234). His parents died when he was 14. He joins first the Franciscan, then the Trappist brotherhood, but does not fit in. Instead, he discovers a passion for words and writing and is further encouraged in his aspiration to become a writer by his grandmother when he moves to her house in Venice. Upon her death she leaves him a cat, Spellvexit, some money, and her old palazzo that eventually, after protracted legal proceedings, he will own. He now has returned to the States to earn a living. Quinsyburg is a small town in the backwater of the South –“nothing surrounded by nowhere” (p. 13). In his class he encounters a beautiful 18-year old freshman, Isabel Rawthorne, and falls in love with her. With a “low degree” family background she hails from Fawx’s Mt., Virginia. The romance blossoms, but there are consequences. Isabel fails in her freshman year and has to leave Quinsy, taking a position as a telephone operator in Charlottesville. The romance has also interfered with the writing of his book, Rumpopulorum, “a grimoire, in the old style” (p. 5) dealing with angels and similar metaphysical entities and their relation to man. He ventures to London for research, and he invites Isabel for a visit; during their time together in London, they become engaged. Back in Virginia, she reenters Quinsy and he continues his teaching job. After he has published his book, he gets an offer to teach at Harvard, while Isabel has finished her studies. He wants to accept the job and move, but she is reluctant and afraid that he might leave her eventually. He offers to marry her. But when he moves to Harvard, she stays behind, postpones the marriage date, and is harder and harder to reach. Eventually, Darconville travels to Fawx’s Mt. to confront her. At this point, Spellvexit runs away. Darconville learns that she does not care for him anymore. She has found a new lover, a son of the well-to-do van der Slang family of Dutch background she had known since childhood. He is desperate. Back at Harvard, he falls under the spell of Dr. Crucifer, a satanic sophist and misogynist who abrogated his sex as not to fall under the spell of a woman. Crucifer works on Darconville turning his love for Isabel into hate. He urges him to seek revenge convincing him that Isabel is not only worthless but needs to die. Darconville sets out to kill her at Fawx’s Mt. After this experience Darconville retreats to Venice where in his palazzo he is able to use “remembrance” to write his ultimate work. He realizes the importance of memory. “All forgetfulness… was in itself immoral, for the permanence with which experiences stay with a man is proportional to the significance they had for him: memory must be preserved from time” (p. 677). The past becomes the “playground” of the artist. Neglected, coughing blood, and shivering from fever he suffers from a progressive debilitating lung disease. Aware that his time is running out he rushes to finish the work before he dies. The unnamed manuscript boxed in a tin can is handed to his uncaring physician in lieu of payment. Style The novel displays Theroux’s love of words and mastery of language, – it is as Victor Howes puts it, \\"a potpourri of language, a torrent of verbalism, a feast of vocabularies\\". The reader will encounter countless new and unknown words, but \\"(u)se your definitionary … It is one of the last few pleasures left in life,\\" so the advice of the protagonist when trying to teach the class about Keats' Bright Star (p. 56). Darconville’s Cat has been named a work of \\"obvious excess\\" and \\"a literary game of the Nabokovian kind\\". Thus, its catalogues of books may contains real and fictive works,- for the reader to find out. The novel contains 100 chapters of all forms of style including essay, diary, poem, sermon, invocation, satire, fable, travelogue, catalogue, meditation, list, precis, and pages mirrored or black. Reception Patrick O'Donnell calls it a \\"largely ignored masterpiece\\". The novel was included by Anthony Burgess in Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English Since 1939. It was also nominated for a National Book Award and made the Good Reads list of the 100 Top Literary Novels of All Time. In his review, Stuart Mitchner also indicates that the book is very difficult to read. James Wolcott, writing in the New York Review of Books echoes this sentiment: \\"To fidgety readers, the 700-plus pages of Darconville’s Cat may seem as long as the Trojan War\\", but he also calls the book \\"sly and resourceful.\\"Wolcott, James. \\"Sailors Have More Fun\\". The New York Review of Books. May 14, 1981. Accessed May 9, 2015. Tom LeClair calls it a book of \\"obvious excess\\" and Steven Moore places it in the genre of \\"huge, erudite novels\\". Victor Howes, writing in the Christian Science Monitor, states: \\"Yes, this is a hobbyhorse of a novel. Hobbyhorsical. Some will love it. Others will hate it. Like Darconville's only love – Isabel Rawsthorne (rosethorn, raw as thorn) – it both satisfies and disappoints. It needs pruning, but would suffer from the shears.\\"Howes, Victor. \\"Celebration and satire – at length; Darconville's Cat, by Alexander Theroux. New York: Doubleday. $15.95.\\" Christian Science Monitor. May 11, 1981. Accessed May 9, 2015. In Book Lust, Nancy Pearl calls it \\"a verbal tour de force\\" and says the book highlights the author's \\"almost perverse infatuation with language.\\" Doug Nufer writes that \\"(w)ith its dazzling vocabulary, play of different voices, and a profusion of forms, Darconville's Cat is a 700-page showcase of ornate and meticulous syntax, in a variety of styles and modes, mixing the natural with the supernatural and romantic fantasy with cynical satire\\". In Signs of the Literary Times William O'Rourke discusses Darconville's Cat which came out at the same time as O'Rourke's Idle Hands. Among the many literary references in Darconville's Cat, O'Rourke sees several bits, including the final sentence, which O'Rourke believes were inspired by Edward Dahlberg's works, and questions why Dahlberg is not included in Theroux's list of acknowledgments.

At depth it is significantly enriched in volatiles (dubbed \\"ices\\") such as water, ammonia and methane. The opposite is true for the upper atmosphere, which contains very few gases heavier than hydrogen and helium due to its low temperature. Uranus's atmosphere is the coldest of all the planets, with its temperature reaching as low as 49 K. The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into five main layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of −600 and 50 km and pressures from 100 to 0.1 bar; the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4000 km and pressures of between and the hot thermosphere (and exosphere) extending from an altitude of 4,056 km to several Uranian radii from the nominal surface at 1 bar pressure. Unlike Earth's, Uranus's atmosphere has no mesosphere. The troposphere hosts four cloud layers: methane clouds at about 1.2 bar, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia clouds at 3–10 bar, ammonium hydrosulfide clouds at 20–40 bar, and finally water clouds below 50 bar. Only the upper two cloud layers have been observed directly—the deeper clouds remain speculative. Above the clouds lie several tenuous layers of photochemical haze. Discrete bright tropospheric clouds are rare on Uranus, probably due to sluggish convection in the planet's interior. Nevertheless, observations of such clouds were used to measure the planet's zonal winds, which are remarkably fast with speeds up to 240 m/s. Little is known about the Uranian atmosphere as to date only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which passed by the planet in 1986, obtained some valuable compositional data. No other missions to Uranus are currently scheduled.  Observation and exploration  Uranus's atmosphere taken during the Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy (OPAL) program. Although there is no well- defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's gaseous envelope (the region accessible to remote sensing) is called its atmosphere. Remote sensing capability extends down to roughly 300 km below the 1 bar level, with a corresponding pressure around 100 bar and temperature of 320 K. The observational history of the Uranian atmosphere is long and full of error and frustration. Uranus is a relatively faint object, and its visible angular diameter is smaller than 5″. The first spectra of Uranus were observed through a prism in 1869 and 1871 by Angelo Secchi and William Huggins, who found a number of broad dark bands, which they were unable to identify. They also failed to detect any solar Fraunhofer lines—the fact later interpreted by Norman Lockyer as indicating that Uranus emitted its own light as opposed to reflecting light from the Sun. In 1889 however, astronomers observed solar Fraunhofer lines in photographic ultraviolet spectra of the planet, proving once and for all that Uranus was shining by reflected light. The nature of the broad dark bands in its visible spectrum remained unknown until the fourth decade of the twentieth century. Although Uranus is presently largely blank in appearance, it has been historically shown to have occasional features, such as in March and April 1884, when astronomers Henri Joseph Perrotin, Norman Lockyer, and Charles Trépied observed a bright, elongated spot (presumably a storm) circling the equator of the planet. The key to deciphering Uranus's spectrum was found in the 1930s by Rupert Wildt and Vesto Slipher, who found that the dark bands at 543, 619, 925, 865 and 890 nm belonged to gaseous methane. They had never been observed before because they were very weak and required a long path length to be detected. This meant that the atmosphere of Uranus was transparent to a much greater depth compared to those of other giant planets. In 1950, Gerard Kuiper noticed another diffuse dark band in the spectrum of Uranus at 827 nm, which he failed to identify. In 1952 Gerhard Herzberg, a future Nobel Prize winner, showed that this band was caused by the weak quadrupole absorption of molecular hydrogen, which thus became the second compound detected on Uranus. Until 1986 only two gases, methane and hydrogen, were known in the Uranian atmosphere. The far-infrared spectroscopic observation beginning from 1967 consistently showed the atmosphere of Uranus was in approximate thermal balance with incoming solar radiation (in other words, it radiated as much heat as it received from the Sun), and no internal heat source was required to explain observed temperatures. No discrete features had been observed on Uranus prior to the Voyager 2 visit in 1986. In January 1986, the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by Uranus at a minimal distance of 107,100 km providing the first close-up images and spectra of its atmosphere. They generally confirmed that the atmosphere was made of mainly hydrogen and helium with around 2% methane. The atmosphere appeared highly transparent and lacking thick stratospheric and tropospheric hazes. Only a limited number of discrete clouds were observed. In the 1990s and 2000s, observations by the Hubble Space Telescope and by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (the Keck telescope and NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, for instance) made it possible for the first time to observe discrete cloud features from Earth. Tracking them has allowed astronomers to re-measure wind speeds on Uranus, known before only from the Voyager 2 observations, and to study the dynamics of the Uranian atmosphere.  Composition  The composition of the Uranian atmosphere is different from that of Uranus as a whole, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium. The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of hydrogen/helium, was determined from the analysis of Voyager 2 far infrared and radio occultation observations. The currently accepted value is in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction . This value is very close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of , indicating that helium has not settled towards the centre of the planet as it has in the gas giants. The third most abundant constituent of the Uranian atmosphere is methane ,NASA NSSDC, Uranus Fact Sheet (retrieved 7 Oc 2015) the presence of which has been known for some time as a result of the ground-based spectroscopic observations. Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared, making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3 bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. The mixing ratio is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the tropopause, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. Methane appears to be undersaturated in the upper troposphere above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known. However, as with methane, their abundances are probably greater than solar values by a factor of at least 20 to 30, and possibly by a factor of a few hundred. Knowledge of the isotopic composition of Uranus's atmosphere is very limited. To date the only known isotope abundance ratio is that of deuterium to light hydrogen: , which was measured by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) in the 1990s. It appears to be higher than the protosolar value of measured in Jupiter. The deuterium is found almost exclusively in hydrogen deuteride molecules which it forms with normal hydrogen atoms. Infrared spectroscopy, including measurements with Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), and UV occultation observations, found trace amounts of complex hydrocarbons in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by solar UV radiation. They include ethane , acetylene , methylacetylene , diacetylene . Infrared spectroscopy also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the stratosphere, which are likely to originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.  Structure  Temperature profile of the Uranian troposphere and lower stratosphere. Cloud and haze layers are also indicated. The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three main layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of −300 and 50 km and pressures from 100 to 0.1 bar; the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4000 km and pressures between and the thermosphere/exosphere extending from 4000 km to as high as a few Uranus radii from the surface. There is no mesosphere.  Troposphere  The troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude. The temperature falls from about 320 K at the base of the troposphere at −300 km to about 53 K at 50 km. The temperature at the cold upper boundary of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually varies in the range between 49 and 57 K depending on planetary latitude, with the lowest temperature reached near 25° southern latitude. The troposphere holds almost all of the mass of the atmosphere, and the tropopause region is also responsible for the vast majority of the planet's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of . The troposphere is believed to possess a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of , ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of , ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10 bar and finally thin methane clouds at . Although Voyager 2 directly detected methane clouds, all other cloud layers remain speculative. The existence of a hydrogen sulfide cloud layer is only possible if the ratio of sulfur and nitrogen abundances (S/N ratio) is significantly greater than its solar value of 0.16. Otherwise all hydrogen sulfide would react with ammonia, producing ammonium hydrosulfide, and the ammonia clouds would appear instead in the pressure range 3–10 bar. The elevated S/N ratio implies depletion of ammonia in the pressure range 20–40 bar, where the ammonium hydrosulfide clouds form. These can result from the dissolution of ammonia in water droplets within water clouds or in the deep water-ammonia ionic ocean. The exact location of the upper two cloud layers is somewhat controversial. Methane clouds were directly detected by Voyager 2 at 1.2–1.3 bar by radio occultation. This result was later confirmed by an analysis of the Voyager 2 limb images. The top of the deeper ammonia/hydrogen sulfide clouds were determined to be at 3 bar based on the spectroscopic data in the visible and near-infra spectral ranges (0.5–1 μm). However a recent analysis of the spectroscopic data in the wavelength range 1–2.3 μm placed the methane cloudtops at 2 bar, and the top of the lower clouds at 6 bar. This contradiction may be resolved when new data on methane absorption in Uranus's atmosphere are available. The optical depth of the two upper cloud layers varies with latitude: both become thinner at the poles as compared to the equator, though in 2007 the methane cloud layer's optical depth had a local maximum at 45°S, where the southern polar collar is located (see below). The troposphere is very dynamic, exhibiting strong zonal winds, bright methane clouds, dark spots and noticeable seasonal changes. (see below) Temperature profiles in the stratosphere and thermosphere of Uranus. The shaded area is where hydrocarbons are concentrated.  Stratosphere  The stratosphere is the middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere, in which temperature generally increases with altitude from 53 K in the tropopause to between 800 and 850 K at the base thermosphere. The heating of the stratosphere is caused by the downward heat conduction from the hot thermosphere as well as by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and the complex hydrocarbons formed as a result of methane photolysis. The methane enters the stratosphere through the cold tropopause, where its mixing ratio relative to molecular hydrogen is about 3, three times below saturation. It decreases further to about 10−7 at the altitude corresponding to pressure of 0.1 mbar. Hydrocarbons heavier than methane are present in a relatively narrow layer between 160 and 320 km in altitude, corresponding to the pressure range from 10 to 0.1 mbar and temperatures from 100 to 130 K. The most abundant stratospheric hydrocarbons after methane are acetylene and ethane, with mixing ratios of around 10−7. Heavier hydrocarbons like methylacetylene and diacetylene have mixing ratios of about 10−10—three orders of magnitude lower. The temperature and hydrocarbon mixing ratios in the stratosphere vary with time and latitude. Complex hydrocarbons are responsible for the cooling of the stratosphere, especially acetylene, having a strong emission line at the wavelength of 13.7 μm. In addition to hydrocarbons, the stratosphere contains carbon monoxide, as well as traces of water vapor and carbon dioxide. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide—3—is very similar to that of the hydrocarbons, while the mixing ratios of carbon dioxide and water are about 10−11 and 8, respectively. These three compounds are distributed relatively homogeneously in the stratosphere and are not confined to a narrow layer like hydrocarbons. Ethane, acetylene and diacetylene condense in the colder lower part of stratosphere forming haze layers with an optical depth of about 0.01 in visible light. Condensation occurs at approximately 14, 2.5 and 0.1 mbar for ethane, acetylene and diacetylene, respectively. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets—the upper atmosphere of Uranus is very clean and transparent above the haze layers. This depletion is caused by weak vertical mixing, and makes Uranus's stratosphere less opaque and, as a result, colder than those of other giant planets. The hazes, like their parent hydrocarbons, are distributed unevenly across Uranus; at the solstice of 1986, when Voyager 2 passed by the planet, they were concentrated near the sunlit pole, making it dark in ultraviolet light.  Thermosphere and ionosphere  The outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere, extending for thousands of kilometres, is the thermosphere/exosphere, which has a uniform temperature of around 800 to 850 K. This is much higher than, for instance, the 420 K observed in the thermosphere of Saturn. The heat sources necessary to sustain such high temperatures are not understood, since neither solar FUV/EUV radiation nor auroral activity can provide the necessary energy. The weak cooling efficiency due to the depletion of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere may contribute to this phenomenon. In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere contains a large proportion of free hydrogen atoms, while helium is thought to be absent here, because it separates diffusively at lower altitudes. The thermosphere and upper part of the stratosphere contain a large concentration of ions and electrons, forming the ionosphere of Uranus. Radio occultation observations by the Voyager 2 spacecraft showed that the ionosphere lies between 1,000 and 10,000 km altitude and may include several narrow and dense layers between 1,000 and 3,500 km. The electron density in the Uranian ionosphere is on average , reaching to as high as in the narrow layers in the stratosphere. The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity. The auroral activity on Uranus is not as powerful as at Jupiter and Saturn and contributes little to the ionization. The high electron density may be in part caused by the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere. One of the sources of information about the ionosphere and thermosphere comes from ground-based measurements of the intense mid-infrared (3–4 μm) emissions of the trihydrogen cation (). The total emitted power is 1–2 W—an order of magnitude higher than that the near-infrared hydrogen quadrupole emissions. Trihydrogen cation functions as one of main coolers of the ionosphere. The upper atmosphere of Uranus is the source of the far ultraviolet (90–140 nm) emissions known as dayglow or electroglow, which, like the IR radiation, emanates exclusively from the sunlit part of the planet. This phenomenon, which occurs in the thermospheres of all giant planets and was mysterious for a time after its discovery, is interpreted as a UV fluorescence of atomic and molecular hydrogen excited by solar radiation or by photoelectrons.  Hydrogen corona  The upper part of the thermosphere, where the mean free path of the molecules exceeds the scale height, is called the exosphere. The lower boundary of the Uranian exosphere, the exobase, is located at a height of about 6,500 km, or 1/4 of the planetary radius, above the surface. The exosphere is unusually extended, reaching as far as several Uranian radii from the planet. It is made mainly of hydrogen atoms and is often called the hydrogen corona of Uranus. The high temperature and relatively high pressure at the base of the thermosphere explain in part why Uranus's exosphere is so vast. The number density of atomic hydrogen in the corona falls slowly with the distance from the planet, remaining as high a few hundred atoms per cm3 at a few radii from Uranus. The effects of this bloated exosphere include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings. The infalling dust in turn contaminates the upper atmosphere of the planet.  Dynamics  Zonal wind speeds on Uranus. Shaded areas show the southern collar and its future northern counterpart. The red curve is a symmetrical fit to the data. Uranus has a relatively bland appearance, lacking broad colorful bands and large clouds prevalent on Jupiter and Saturn. Discrete features were only once observed in Uranus's atmosphere before 1986. The most conspicuous features on Uranus observed by Voyager 2 were the dark low latitude region between −40° and −20° and bright southern polar cap. The northern boundary of the cap was located at about −45° of latitude. The brightest zonal band was located near the edge of the cap at −50° to −45° and was then called a polar collar. The southern polar cap, which existed at the time of the solstice in 1986, faded away in 1990s. After the equinox in 2007, the southern polar collar started to fade away as well, while the northern polar collar located at 45° to 50° latitude (first appeared in 2007) have grown more conspicuous since then. The atmosphere of Uranus is calm compared to those of other giant planets. Only a limited number of small bright clouds at middle latitudes in both hemispheres and one Uranus Dark Spot have been observed since 1986. One of those bright cloud features, located at −34° of latitude and called Berg, probably existed continuously since at least 1986. Nevertheless, the Uranian atmosphere has rather strong zonal winds blowing in the retrograde (counter to the rotation) direction near the equator, but switching to the prograde direction poleward of ±20° latitude. The wind speeds are from −50 to −100 m/s at the equator increasing up to 240 m/s near 50° latitude. The wind profile measured before the equinox of 2007 was slightly asymmetric with winds stronger in the southern hemisphere, although it turned out to be a seasonal effect as this hemisphere was continuously illuminated by the Sun before 2007. After 2007 winds in the northern hemisphere accelerated while those in the southern one slowed down. Uranus exhibits a considerable seasonal variation over its 84-year orbit. It is generally brighter near solstices and dimmer at equinoxes. The variations are largely caused by changes in the viewing geometry: a bright polar region comes into view near solstices, while the dark equator is visible near equinoxes. Still there exist some intrinsic variations of the reflectivity of the atmosphere: periodically fading and brightening polar caps as well as appearing and disappearing polar collars.

Size Hatchlings of P. brongersmai range from in total length (including tail). Adult males typically range from in total length, and females between although a few have been recorded at . These snakes generally look overweight due to their robust structure. Lifespan Most experts agree that P. brongersmai can live 20 years or more in captivity if proper care is given. Coloration The color pattern of P. brongersmai consists of rich, bright red to orange to a duller rusty red ground color, although populations with yellow and brown are known. This is overlaid with yellow and tan blotches and stripes that run the length of the body, as well as tan and black spots that extend up the flanks. The belly is white, often with small black markings. The head is usually a shade of grey; individual snakes can change how light and dark the head is. A white postocular stripe runs down and back from the posterior edge of the eye. Reproduction Python brongersmai is oviparous, with up to 30 eggs being laid at a time. The female coils around her eggs and shivers her body, producing heat to incubate the eggs properly. Commercial trade Once widely considered to be generally unpredictable and aggressive, P. brongersmai is gradually becoming more common among herpetoculturists. Formerly, many of the specimens in captivity were wild-caught adults from Malaysia. These are known to be more aggressive than those from Indonesia (Sumatra), from which most of the wild-caught, wild-bred, and captive-bred stock are now descended. Captive- raised juveniles generally become mild-tempered, somewhat-predictable adults. This, combined with several new brightly colored captive bloodlines, is helping to boost the popularity of these much-maligned snakes among reptile hobbyists. Python brongersmai is part of a commercial harvest for leather. Taxonomy This species was first described by Olive Griffith Stull in 1938 as Python curtus brongersmai, a subspecies of Python curtus.Stull OG (1938). \\"Three New Subspecies of the Family Boidae\\". Occ. Pap. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist. 8: 297-300. (Python curtus brongersmai, new species, pp. 297-298). This taxon has since been elevated and recognised as a full species, Python brongersmai, by Pauwels et al. (2000).

It hosted a single 60 cm Cassegrain telescope and a small cottage for the operators, located amongst the instruments funded by other organizations. The first observational runs started in 1971, and like many smaller instruments, it was later shut down in favor of a partial share in a much larger telescope in 1997. Although small by modern standards, the Southern Observatory nevertheless became famous for its role in the discovery of SN 1987A when UofT astronomer Ian Shelton spotted the supernova while attempting to fix another disused telescope at the site. History The Southern Observatory came about as a side-effect of problems being caused by the urban sprawl in the Toronto area. Originally located far in the country outside the city, the University's David Dunlap Observatory was being encroached on by new suburbs to its west. There seemed to be no end in sight to the outward growth of the city, and the process would eventually result in the Observatory being completely surrounded by housing, rendering it largely unusable due to street lighting. The director considered looking for a new site further north of the city, but at this time in the late 1960s a number of major observatories were starting to set up stations in Chile. Astronomers at the University, Garrison, Racine and van den Bergh, all had experience with Chile, and strongly urged establishing a site there. The result was a National Research Council of Canada (NRC) grant in 1969 to purchase a 60 cm prototype telescope from Competition Associates in Boston. An agreement was reached with the Carnegie Institution of Washington to locate this telescope at their Las Campanas site in Chile, and further funding for a cottage, Casa Canadiense, was provided by University of Toronto Astronomy endowment funds. Operating costs were originally paid for by a grant from the University of Toronto Associates in New York, and later by grants from the NRC (NSERC after its name changed). The first regular observing run with the telescope started in 1971 under Bill Harris. The telescope was equipped for spectroscopy, photometry, and photography; CCD's were installed later. In 1992 it was named the Helen Sawyer Hogg Telescope (HSHT) in recognition of Hogg's work on measuring the distance to variable stars in globular clusters. Work continued on the telescope until 1997 when funding was directed to buying a share of the Gemini Observatory being built on Cerro Pachón. HSHT was then donated to the CASLEO (Leoncito Astronomical Complex), the National Observatory of Argentina, and moved, along with the entire dome and building, to their observatory in El Leoncito National Park, where it began operations in 2001. UofT retains a 25% share in observational time on the HSHT.

This woman, a painter and artistic trainer for children, was his first choice in 26 years of life as a slave for his father's wishes, or maybe it's the cosmic wishes of fate itself, as he might feel as a crushed young man who wished to be anything but being what he is. He received a total shock when the woman dumped him at last, did an abortion for his baby, and tells him that they can't live up the relation they have, because it goes to be crushed, sooner or later. in the final scene, we see the painter watches the TV, we could understand he's witnessing the US forces entering Baghdad, then he begin to prepare his suitcase, which gives us a hint he's going to leave the country.

The New Zealand Governor Captain Hobson had told the New Zealand Company that it could only found a settlement in the vicinity of Blind Bay in accordance with an agreement reached with local Maori. On 9 October Captain Wakefield, Tuckett, Stephens, and their guide a Mr Moore landed at Kaiteriteri and discussed possible alternative locations with the local Maori. Apparently the local Maori omitted to mention Nelson haven as they wanted the settlement constructed near their pa site. It was another two weeks before the New Zealand Company discovered Nelson haven and a further week before Wakefield decided to make it the place of settlement (either late September or early October 1841).Correspondent, Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume V, Issue 217, 2 May 1846, Page 35 Stephens assisted in surveying Nelson's town acres, as well as the Takaka and Aorere Valleys. For much of his time in the Province he lived at Riwaka. His neighbours were a native couple, Mary and Etani, who were on friendly terms with his family. In January 1843 he noted:\\"Oh! How do I blush for my countrymen, when I write that our fears for the safety of ourselves and property are not from the natives, but from the gangs of bad white men who now infest the country.\\" He was appointed a Magistrate in Motueka in 1843.Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume II, Issue 58, 15 April 1843, Page 230 Stephens resigned in 1844 to take the place of Chief Surveyor for the District when Tuckett resigned.Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, Volume II, Issue 58, 15 April 1843, Page 230 During his time in Nelson Stephens kept meteorological records and provided 11 years of these to Captain Drury RN, HMS Pandora prior to his demise.Meteorology of New Zealand, Colonist, Issue 47, 2 April 1858, Page 3 In 1845 he explored Lake Rotoiti and the Buller Valley, constructed a water-powered flour mill and surveyed a demarcation line between disputed lands at Wakapuaka. But in mid-1845 Stephens suffered from an outbreak of abscesses and ulcers, which were to plague him for the rest of his life. In 1848 he wrote to his sister saying that his ‘miserable affliction' had left him a mental and physical wreck and that he had been unable to walk without great pain for nearly three years. The affliction stopped him working as a surveyor. In the summers between 1848 and 1853 Stephens and his wife lived at a beach camp at Stephens Bay, Kaiteriteri. He became the Member of Parliament in the 1st Parliament for the Town of Nelson from 19 June 1854, when he replaced William Travers, who had resigned on 26 May 1854 to contest the Waimea seat. Since 19 August 1854, Stephens also represented the District of Motueka on the Provincial Council. After a period of lingering illness he died on 26 June 1855, and the seat was left vacant until the election of the second Parliament (the election in the Nelson electorate was held on 12 November 1855).

The two leaders signed the compromise of the Taba arbitration, reaffirming the notion of negotiation and dialogue to solve international affairs and disputes. President Mubarak and Prime Minister Shimon declared 1987 as a year of negotiations for peace.Article in \\"The New York Times\\" The Alexandria Declaration was signed on 21 January 2002 by 17 religious leaders: 6 Rabbis, 5 Sheikhs and 6 Bishops or their representatives.The First Alexandria Declaration, accessed 31 July 2017 The declaration has seven points and begins: # The Holy Land is holy to all three of our faiths. Therefore, followers of the divine religions must respect its sanctity, and bloodshed must not be allowed to pollute it. The sanctity and integrity of the Holy Places must be preserved, and the freedom of religious worship must be ensured for all. Following the signing of the Alexandria Declaration, religious leaders of Islamic, Jewish, and Christian faiths convened in Washington D.C.. The leaders endorsed the declaration and the sanctity of the holy land for all three faiths. Leaders at this conference included: Iman Shaker Elsayed, former Iman of the Islamic Center of Washington, Rabbi David Saperstein, Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Bishop Allen Bartlett, Assisting Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, Imam Yayha Hendi, Muslim Chaplain at Georgetown University, Rabbi Scott M. Sperling, Regional Director of the Mid- Atlantic Council, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Fr. Peter Ruggere, Maryknoll Office of Peace and Justice, Imam Johari Abel, Muslim Chaplain at Howard University, Bishop Felton Edwin May, United Methodist Church Bishop of Greater Washington, Rev. Lynne Faris, National Presbyterian Church, Rev. Mark Brown, Director of Government Relations for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and Dr. J. J. Philip Wogaman, Senior Pastor of Foundry United Methodist Church among others. This meeting took place at St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C on March 26 at 11am.U.S. Newswire Two years later on May 22–23 at the Arab League summit the Alexandria Declaration was rediscussed and a reform document with principles similar to the declaration. The main issues the Arab world had with the Alexandria Declaration and the Greater Middle East Initiative was the forcing of sovereign countries to reform and continued Palestinian conflict. Seeing the Palestinian issues as an obstacle to reform, it was agreed that a solution must precede major changes.The Middle East Media Research Institute Process The process has two dimensions: internal, relating to the residents of Israel/Palestine, and external. Internally, the goal is to stimulate the ongoing dialogue between religious leaders, which has not existed here before. Externally, there is a need to involve the leaders of key Muslim countries whose support will be vital if there is agreement on issues like Jerusalem and the holy sites.Israeli, Palestinian Religious Leaders Meet to Find a Way to Peace, Presbyterian News Service March 27, 2002 A Permanent Committee for the Implementation of the Alexandria Declaration (PCIAD) was formed to support the implementation of the declaration.White, A., My Journey So Far, Lion Hudson, 2015, 2016, p. 130 In January 2004, Israeli rabbis participated in a Muslim peace conference in Cairo which formed part of the Alexandria Process.

Cook analyses and dismisses the date in the thirteenth century adopted by C.

The sarcophagus is famed for its bas relief carvings, and its Phoenician inscription. One of five known Byblian royal inscriptions, the inscription is considered to be the earliest known example of the fully developed Phoenician alphabet.Cook, p1 For some scholars it represents the terminus post quem of the transmission of the alphabet to Europe. Ahirom is not attested in any other Ancient Oriental source, although some scholars have suggested a possible connection to the contemporary King Hiram mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (see Hiram I). Discovery The sarcophagus was found following a landslide in the cliffs surrounding Byblos (in now modern-day Lebanon) in late 1923, which revealed a number of Phoenician royal tombs. The tomb of Ahirom was ten metres deep.René Cagnat, Nouvelles Archéologiques, Syria 4 (1923): 334–344Pierre Montet, \\"Les fouilles de Byblos en 1923,\\" L’Illustration 3 (May 3, 1924), 402–405.Calligraphy and Craftsmanship in the Ahirom inscription.

Lehmann  Sarcophagus  The sarcophagus of Ahiram was discovered by the French archaeologist Pierre Montet in 1923 in Byblos.; ; Its low relief carved panels make it \\"the major artistic document for the Early Iron Age\\" in Phoenicia. [pp. 13, 19-22] Associated items dating to the Late Bronze Age either support an early dating, in the 13th century BC or attest the reuse of an early shaft tomb in the 11th century BC. The major scene represents a king seated on a throne carved with winged sphinxes. A priestess offers him a lotus flower. On the lid two male figures face one another with seated lions between them. These figures have been interpreted by Glenn Markoe as representing the father and son of the inscription. The rendering of figures and the design of the throne and a table show strong Assyrian influences. A total absence of Egyptian objects of the 20th and 21st dynasties in PhoeniciaJ.

Dynastensarkophage mit szenischen Reliefs aus Byblos und Zypern Teil 1.1)  Inscriptions  An inscription of 38 words is found on parts of the rim and the lid of the sarcophagus. It is written in the Old Phoenician dialect of Byblos and is the oldest witness to the Phoenician alphabet of considerable length discovered to date:The most recent scholarly book which deals with all aspects of the inscription is Reinhard G.

Februar 2012 an der Universität Basel (AOAT 425), Münster: Ugarit- Verlag 2015, pp. 163-180) the translation of the sarcophagus inscription reads: > A coffin made it [Pil]sibaal, son of Ahirom, king of Byblos, for Ahirom, his > father, lo, thus he put him in seclusion. Now, if a king among kings and a > governor among governors and a commander of an army should come up against > Byblos; and when he then uncovers this coffin – (then:) may strip off the > sceptre of his judiciary, may be overturned the throne of his kingdom, and > peace and quiet may flee from Byblos. And as for him, one should cancel his > registration concerning the libation tube of the memorial sacrifice. The formulas of the inscription were immediately recognised as literary in nature, and the assured cutting of the archaic letters suggested to Charles Torrey a form of writing already in common use. A 10th-century BC date for the inscription has become widely accepted. Halfway down the burial shaft another short inscription was found incised at the southern wall. It had been first published as a warning to an excavator not to proceed further,by René Dussaud, in Syria 5 (1924:135-57). but now is understood as part of some initiation ritual which remains unknown in detail.Reinhard G. Lehmann: Die Inschrift(en) des Ahirom-Sarkophags und die Schachtinschrift des Grabes V in Jbeil (Byblos), 2005, p. 39-53 It reads: > Concerning knowledge: here and now be humble (you yourself!) ‹in› this > basement!\\" King Ahiram Ahiram himself is not entitled a king, neither of Byblos nor of any other city state. It is said that he was succeeded by his son Ithobaal I who is the first to be explicitly entitled King of Byblos, which is due to an old misreading of a text lacuna. According to a new reconstruction of the lacuna the name of Ahiram's son is to be read [Pil]sibaal, and the reading Ithobaal should be disregarded. The early king list of Byblos is again subject to further study.

IWGIA's work is primarily funded by the Nordic Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the European Union. IWGIA holds consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and has observer status with the Arctic Council and with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.  History  The constitution of the IWGIA as a body was first proposed and initiated in August 1968, at the 38th International Congress of Americanists, held in Munich and Stuttgart. Formed as a co- operative of academic anthropologist researchers and human rights activists, the IWGIA was initially concerned with redressing the threats posed by the rapid development of settlements and industries to the indigenous groups living in the Amazon Basin. A network for indigenous advocacy and activism was first established in Brazil and Paraguay, with the IWGIA later expanding its activities and involvement to the concerns of indigenous American peoples generally. Subsequently, the IWGIA's working groups, advocacy support and research publications extended to cover indigenous issues across all continental regions of the globe. IWGIA was one of the very first organisations to be established in support of indigenous peoples. It was founded in 1968 by anthropologists concerned at the atrocities being committed against Indians in South America. Within a few years, a small group of dedicated scholars working on a voluntary basis had managed to establish a documentation centre that became well-known to concerned people the world over. The project grew to encompass international human rights work, empowerment projects, publishing and information dissemination.https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/0015_IWGIA_- _a_history.pdf Since the May 28, 2000 adoption of changes to its statutes, the IWGIA has been incorporated as a membership organization, whose base membership contributes an annual subscription fee towards the running of the organization and funding of its activities.  Activities  2019 saw an improvement in the statistics and data surrounding Indigenous Peoples. The International Labour Organisation published a lower-bound estimate of 476 million Indigenous people globally.https://www.ilo.org/global/publications/books/WCMS_735607/lang-- en/index.htm IWGIA's work was cited in the report, while the World Bank and ILO both acknowledge that despite Indigenous Peoples making up only 6% of the global population, they make up 15% of the world’s extreme poor.https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples IWGIA support indigenous peoples' organisations through its regional and thematic programmes. As of December 2019, IWGIA has changed its institutional focus from three regional programmes - on Africa, Latin America and Asia - and one country programme, supporting indigenous peoples in the Russian Federation, plus a programme on climate change, supporting indigenous participation in international climate change processes and local activities and awareness raising related to national REDD+ strategies to four thematic programmes. The four thematic programmes IWIGA works with in 2019 are climatehttps://www.iwgia.org/en/focus/climate-action.html, land rightshttps://www.iwgia.org/en/focus/land-rights.html, Indigenous rights defenders at riskhttps://www.iwgia.org/en/focus/indigenous-rights-defenders- at-risk.html, and global governancehttps://www.iwgia.org/en/focus/global- governance.html. Alongside these thematic programmes are programmes on communications and documentation and alliances and engagement. The Publications programme has been integrated into communications and documentation and includes the publication of IWGIA's yearbook \\"The Indigenous World\\", as well as a variety of books, human rights reports, briefing papers, manuals and videos mostly in English and Spanish.

Danbury High School is a public high school in Danbury, Connecticut, with approximately 3000 students. It is in Danbury Public Schools. Despite Danbury's population of just under 81,000 (as of 2016), there is only one public high school, along with several small private schools, and one vocational high school in the city. The school is located in a suburban, residential neighborhood atop a hill that overlooks most of the city. Danbury High School is the largest high school in the state. Many of the students come from homes in which English is not the dominant spoken language. Therefore, the school offers a wide variety of ESL programs in many different subject areas. Walking through the halls of the school, it is possible to hear over 50 different languages and associated dialects being spoken by the students. Likewise, many of the students will be the first in their family to go on to college. The school's culture and classes are definitely enriched by the diverse student population and the experiences they bring to their education. Danbury High School also offers a large number of AP courses in a wide variety of curricular areas. For example, in the Social Studies Department, AP courses are offered in Human Geography, Government and Politics, European History, Micro and Macro Economics, Psychology, and U.S. History. Danbury High School is supplemented by a magnet program called the Alternative Center for Excellence. This program provides a Danbury High School diploma but exhibits additional criteria not required by most local institutions. Danbury High School recently was awarded $100,000 after winning the State Farm Insurance \\"Celebrate My Drive\\" campaign. The \\"Celebrate My Drive\\" campaign encourages teens to make positive choices as they start driving. History In 1927, a new high school was built on 181 White Street in Danbury. This building served as the city's main high school, until a rapid increase in Danbury's population compelled a major school construction program. In 1965, a new Danbury High School was dedicated on Clapboard Ridge. This campus is still the current location of the school today.

All schools with CMT/ CAPT 2012 participation rates less than 95 percent, four-year cohort graduation rates below 60 percent (for the graduating class of 2011), three-year baseline School Performance Indexes (SPIs) below 64 or identification as Focus Schools were classified as Review Schools. The School Data Team regularly reviews data on attendance, academic achievement, and discipline actions to guide student programming and professional development. Instructional Data Teams meet twice a month to review common assessment data and collaboratively plan lessons. In an effort to increase support for English-Language Learners, new programs are being offered to help students who arrive with little to no formal education. Twenty teachers participated in extensive training in Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol in preparation for mainstreaming English Language Learners into content area classes. Danbury High School recently partnered with Project Opening Doors and has seen tremendous increases in Advanced Placement participation and achievement. All Administrators participated in observation professional development. Teachers at the school are offered over 100 hours of professional development per year. Beginning next fall, freshmen students entering Danbury High School will have an opportunity to earn an associate degree simultaneously with their high school diploma. As part of the Early College Opportunity program, 80 to 100 incoming freshmen students will begin their journey toward an associate degree in information technology issued by Naugatuck Valley Community College.

History MCL Rizal Hall When the ownership of the Mapúa Institute of Technology was transferred in the year 1999 to the Yuchengco Group of Companies (YGC) under the stewardship of the Ambassador Alfonso T. Yuchengco; great amount of face lifting was undertaken to make the facilities of Mapúa at par with international standards and great amount of effort was cultivated to further strengthen the academic programs of the institution. Through the years, new programs were offered such as Computer Science, Information Technology, Material Science and Engineering, Biological Engineering, Nursing, Psychology, Accountancy, and Hotel and Restaurant Management in addition to the Engineering and Architecture programs. In fulfillment of the long term development plan of nothing, a six-hectare land was acquired for its expansion and presence in Laguna, which stands as one of CALABARZON's industrial and commercial hub. Groundwork started in late 2005, and on 23 January 2006, Malayan Colleges Laguna (informally referred to as MCL) acquired its corporate personality following its registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This opened the way for the creation of an interim group under the leadership of Dr. Reynaldo B. Vea, Mapúa Institute of Technology President and CEO, and concurrently the MCL President and CEO, with administrators from Mapua namely Milagros V. Reyes, former Mapúa Executive Vice President for Administration and Chief Operating Officer; Engr. Dodjie Maestrecampo, then Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs; Engr. Dennis H. Tablante, Dean of the School of EE-ECE-CoE; Engr. Christopher F. dela Rosa, Director of Mapua's Development Office for Information Technology; Raoul A. Villegas, Controller of the Mapua IT Center, and Daniel R. Francisco, President for People eServe Corp. In January 2007, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) gave the approval for MCL to offer eight (8) programs of study in Engineering, Information Technology, and Business. This was after MCL's satisfactory compliance with the standards of the CHED's Regional Quality Assurance Team. 18 June 2007 marked MCL's first academic year - Malayan Colleges Laguna opened its doors to the first batch of Malayans. MCL started with three colleges: the Mapúa Institute of Technology at Laguna (MITL), the Enrique T. Yuchengco College of Business (ETYCB), and the College of Information Technology (CIT). In 2008, the Mapúa-PTC College of Maritime Education and Training (CMET) was established in cooperation with the Philippine Transmarine Carrier, Inc. (PTC), one of the country's leading companies in crewing management. In 2009, MCL's College of Arts and Science (CAS) started the Bachelor of Arts in Communication major in Multimedia Arts. In March 2010, the maritime programs acquired ISO and DNV certifications in March 2010, barely two years after establishment, serving as a testament to the quality of MCL's systems and offerings. The preparations for the ABET accreditation of MCL's engineering and IT programs have been started.

Geography A large village situated 4 miles (6 km) south of Saint-Omer, at the D195 and D198 crossroads. It is located on a geological formation called the \\"plateau d'Helfaut\\", which separates the Aa valley to the north from the Lys valley, to the south. The commune is home to a unique geological heritage, resulting in an unusual landscape. The sides of the old quarries alongside the plateau display many geological strata. The quarries of Heuringhem and Blendecques have collapsed as a result of soil creep. The commune gave its name to 'Dilluvium d’Helfaut', a flint and clay formation rare in France and Europe. The commune is home to many rare and protected species in a heathland landscape, which is unusual for northern France and justified the creation of a nature reserve (Les Landes d'Helfaut). Population The inhabitants are called Helfalois. History The village was subject to much damage during World War II, as it was here that the Germans sited La coupole, an underground bunker, housing a huge concrete dome built by the Nazis between 1943 and 1944. Initially this bunker was to serve as a base to launch V2 rockets, but it never entered service because of the many bombing raids by the Allies. The Dome has been transformed into a museum.

Career Martin Stephenson and the Daintees in concert in Glasgow (December 2010) The band were signed to a recording contract with Kitchenware Records and released their first single in 1982. Like other Kitchenware acts the group had their origins in the North East England. The band enjoyed a high critical profile and some minor commercial success. Their best-selling and most acclaimed album is Boat to Bolivia released in 1986. In June 1989, Stephenson took part in that year's Glastonbury Festival. They recorded three further albums – Gladsome, Humour & Blue in 1988, Salutation Road, produced by Pete Anderson, in 1990 and The Boy's Heart in 1992 – but sales fell short of expectations and the band were dropped by their label. After parting company with Kitchenware, Stephenson disbanded the group in 1992, but continued to record both solo and as part of a group. The Daintees reformed in 2000. In April 2012, Stephenson completed an eleven-date high-profile tour with The Daintees playing The Boat to Bolivia album in full to critical acclaim. The touring Daintees line up since November 2010 features original guitarist John Steel (Boat to Bolivia/Jackdaw4), John's wife Kate Stephenson (Midge Ure/Sam Brown/Jackdaw4) on drums, and Lou Short (Martin Stephenson 1997/2000) on bass guitar who left the group March 2013. Daintees have signed a major deal with Absolute music and also have a new agent Neil O'Brien They have remained active in recent years and, in 2018, performed a multi date tour \\"Gladsome, Humour and Blue 30th Anniversary\\" tour which culminated in a rapturous reception at the Sage on Tyneside on 8 December that year. This performance was filmed and released on DVD entitled Gladsome 30. In the same year the actor, comedian and musician Billy Connolly filmed with Stephenson for the two part documentary about Glaswegian's life, in which Stephenson performed the track \\"Rain\\" and Connelly described him warmly him as his idea of a musician and songwriter. Martin Stephenson Martin George Stephenson was born on 27 July 1961, to Alfred and Francis Stephenson in Durham. In January 1990, he married Angela Cape who appeared on the cover of the album Boat to Bolivia, though they later divorced. Stephenson has two daughters.

He was one of the few European rabbis to survive the Holocaust.  Early life  Ephraim Oshry was born in Kupiškis, Lithuania. He studied alongside some of the most prominent and revered Jewish leaders and rabbis of his time, including the Alter of Slabodka, Moshe Mordechai Epstein, Isaac Sher and Avraham Duber Kahana Shapiro (author of Devar Avraham). He quickly rose to prominence among the students at Slabodka Yeshiva.“Rabbi Ephraim Oshry, 89, Led Norfolk St. Temple”, The Villager (New York), vol. 73, No. 22, dated October 1–7, 2003. World War II When the Nazis invaded Kaunas in 1941 during World War II, Oshry's community was forced into the Kaunas Ghetto and Concentration Camp, where his first wife and children were murdered. In his book, The Annihilation of Lithuanian Jewry, Oshry tells his story of living through the Holocaust. He related in horrific detail how the Nazis and their Lithuanian collaborators viciously murdered Jews, but he also focused on the spiritual life of the Jews living in the Kovno Ghetto and concentration camp. Despite being starved and beaten, the Jews continued to study Torah in secret, and risked their lives in order to fulfill the mitzvot (God's commandments). Responsa While in the Kovno Ghetto and concentration camp, Oshry began writing his responsa regarding the Holocaust, answering difficult questions in such subjects as human nature, God, and Jewish ethics. Before the final battle between the Nazis and the Soviets, Oshry buried his responsa in the ground. After the war, he retrieved them, and in 1959, he published some of the Hebrew responsa under the title She'eilos Uteshuvos Mima'amakim (Questions and Responses from the Depths). This volume was later followed by four additional volumes, the final one being published in 1979. An English volume of the original work (adbridged, with much of the halakhic argumentation removed), was published, titled Responsa from the Holocaust. Post-war activities After Kaunas was liberated in August 1944, Oshry and his wife Frieda Greenzwieg, a survivor of Auschwitz, went to Rome. There Oshry started a yeshiva for orphaned refugee children. In 1950, Oshry moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with his family and yeshiva students. In 1952, Oshry moved to New York City, where he became the rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. Oshry opened a yeshiva for boys and a yeshiva for girls named Yeshivah Torah V'Emunah in the East Bronx.  Family  In 1949, Oshry became engaged to his second wife, Frieda Greensweig, a daughter of Sigeter Hasidim, at the suggestion of her uncle Moshe Friserman, the Tomashover Rebbe. Together they had 6 sons, all of whom became rabbis, and 3 daughters. Frieda died in 2018.Hoffman, Rafael (May 29, 2018) \\"Rebbetzin Freida Oshry, A”h\\", Hamodia  Death  Oshry died on September 28, 2003, at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.

Streets within Cordwainer's boundaries are, amongst others, Bow Lane, Pancras Lane and part of Watling Street. Queen Street runs north-south through the centre of the ward.City of London Police Force description Former precincts In mediaeval times and long before the most recent boundary changes in 2003, Cordwainer was divided into eight precincts:Book 2, Ch. 17: Cordwainer Ward , A New History of London: Including Westminster and Southwark (1773), pp. 597-600 25 September 2007 *St. Mary, Aldermary, upper and lower *Allhallows, Bread Street *St. Mary-le-Bow *St. Antholin, upper and lower *St. Pancras *St. Bennet, Sherehog and St. John *St. Thomas the Apostle *TrinityThomas Allen, The City of London and Parts Adjacent: Volume 3  21st century A statue of a cordwainer in the ward. The contemporary ward is home to many large businesses and new initiatives such as Bow Bells House, named after the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church—and not, as sometimes thought, after the area of Bow. Cordwainer contains one other church, St Mary Aldermary, and the site of St Antholin, Budge Row, demolished in 1875. Vanished Churches of the City of London Huelin,G: Guildhall Library Publishing, London, 1996 Cordwainer ward is quite distinctive for its high number of licensed premises.

History  Ferguson is one of the older electronics companies, alongside Ultra, Dynatron, Pye and Bush in the United Kingdom. It was originally an American–Canadian pre-War company making radio sets for the U.K. market based upon contemporary American models. After World War II, it became Ferguson Radio Corporation, making radio receivers and, later, televisions. Later still, it became part of the British Radio Corporation. It was taken over by Thorn Electrical Industries in the late 1950s, but the Ferguson name continued to be used by Thorn, and its successor Thorn EMI. Throughout the company's early history, Ferguson products were very popular across its wide customer base. By the early 1960s its wide product range included a most comprehensive range of audio and TV equipment. Small, battery- operated portable transistor radios to solid oak 6 ft wide hydraulic lid radiograms sporting fully automatic stackable Garrard turntables, multi- channel radios and 2-foot-wide stereo speakers were commonplace in many UK households. Open reel tape recorders and hi-fis followed. Sales held well, with 1980s new introductions including personal cassette players, CD players and video recorders. The 1980s saw much competition from foreign brands such as JVC, Tandy, Hitachi and Sanyo. This took its toll on the Ferguson brand and in 1987 it was sold off to the French electronics company Thomson. Thomson group itself subsequently withdrew from the competitive European consumer electronics market. In the UK, the Ferguson brand was licensed initially to DSI (Dixons and Currys). DSI ceased using it in 2006 and competitor Comet took up the licence and used it until 2012. Comet used the brand on Freeview and Freesat set-top boxes, DVD players and DAB radios. Although Comet went into administration in November 2012, it had discontinued using the Ferguson brand earlier in the year.  Today  In 2017 Ferguson in the UK was relaunched by Cello Electronics, a British LED TV manufacturer. Cello has licensed the name from Technicolor (Thomson) to be used for a new range of televisions.

Drawing made in 1893 by Saint-Elme Gautier. Metal corsets (also known as iron corsets) are a type of historical corset or bodice made entirely out of metal, usually iron or steel. The metal corset was popularly claimed to have been introduced to France by Catherine de' Medici in the 16th century, although this is now considered a myth. The idea that such garments were worn for fashionable purposes is debatable, with fashion historians now regarding such claims sceptically. Many of the original metal bodices that have survived are now believed to have been intended for medical purposes as orthopaedic support garments and back braces. Such garments were described by the French army surgeon Ambroise Paré in the sixteenth century as a remedy for the \\"crookednesse of the Bodie.\\" Some of the more extreme examples of metal corsets that have survived are now generally thought to be later reproductions designed to appeal to fetishists, rather than garments intended for fashionable wear. Metal medical corsets were still being made in the twentieth century, whilst, since the late 20th century, fashion designers such as Alexander McQueen and Issey Miyake have made contemporary metal bodices and corsets from wire and aluminium coils. Origins Catherine de' Medici, c. 1555 Early fashion historians and writers have often attributed the introduction of fashionable corset-wearing to Catherine de' Medici, who is said to have brought metal corsets to France from Italy in the 16th century. The fashion historian Valerie Steele noted that after 19th-century writers catering to audiences for tightlacing and sexual fetishism played up the sadomasochistic idea of a \\"cruel, tortuous fashion\\" enforced by a dominant queen who demanded unrealistically small waists from her subjects, this mythical royal connection captured public imagination and became part of fashion mythology. It is now widely believed that authentic metal corsets were intended as a form of orthopaedic brace to address spinal issues such as scoliosis. The 16th-century French army surgeon Ambroise Paré described metal corsets as intended \\"to amend the crookednesse of the Bodie,\\" recommending that the iron should be perforated in order to make the garments lighter, and that they be made to fit and padded for comfort. Paré criticised the concept of corsetry as a waist-training device, warning that such a practice risked deforming the figure. 16th and 17th centuries Hinged iron corset with back clasp opening. 1580–99. York Castle Museum. A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is dated to the mid-16th century, and thought to be similar to the metal stays recorded as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, it is thought that her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment. 1868 illustration claiming to show a 16th-century steel corset-cover Although surviving metal bodices are usually dated to the late 16th and early 17th century, Steele has stated that some of the more extreme and elaborate examples are fakes created from the 19th century onwards to cater to fetishistic \\"fantasies about women imprisoned in metal corsets.\\" For example, Herbert Norris claimed in Tudor Costume and Fashion (1938) that a misbehaving wife would be locked into a metal corset by her husband until she promised to behave. One such iron corset, with a 14-inch waist, was acquired by the FIT Museum as dating from 1580–1600, but is now considered to be a forgery from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Steele noted suspicious similarities between this corset and an illustration first published in 1868 in The Corset and the Crinoline, a \\"fetishistic\\" book claiming to offer a historical overview of fashion, and draws parallels between such corsets and fake medieval chastity belts. Harold Koda, the former curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, states that the excessive, mechanically produced regularity of the garment's structure is evidence for its being a 19th-century fabrication. Koda's take on the significant percentage of extant nineteenth-century metal corsets made in emulation of purported sixteenth- century models is that they were created to cater to a specialist market, perhaps for inclusion in collector's cabinets. The fashion historians C. Willett Cunnington and his wife Phillis Cunnington also stated firmly that surviving \\"iron bodies,\\" when not medical garments, were usually \\"fanciful 'reproductions'\\" with no proof of their having genuinely been worn. Despite the explicit scepticism of fashion historians such as Steele and the Cunningtons, scholars outside the field of dress history sometimes treat these corsets as legitimate fashion garments. The anthropologist Marianne Thesander concluded that because such bodices fit the fashionable silhouette of their alleged period, they were probably authentic, and served the same purpose as other corsets. 18th and 19th century Orthopaedic corset for a child. Iron. Europe, 1801–1880. In Fashion and Fetishism, David Kunzle noted that in Peter Rondeau's 1739 French-German dictionary, the French term corps de fer is explained in German as \\"Schnürburst, mit kleinen eisernen blechen, für übel gewachsenes Frauenzimmer\\" (A bodice, with small iron plates, for badly grown (i.e., deformed) girls). He reads this as implying that the iron plates would have been part of a fabric corset, rather than an all-metal garment. Kunzle has noted the absence of literary evidence for showing that metal corsets were also worn for fashion purposes. He has suggested that surviving metal garments, if not specifically medical in purpose, might have served the same masochistically gratifying purpose as the deliberately uncomfortable, tortuous hair shirt, combining a fashionable silhouette with penance, and as such, might have been worn in convents. To support his \\"pure speculation\\", Kunzle cites an 1871 newspaper report from The Times reporting that during the Paris Commune, the National Guard found two iron corsets, a rack, and other instruments in the Convent of the White Nuns in Picpus. The claim by the Mother Superior that the instruments were for orthopaedic purposes was dismissed at the time as \\"a superficial falsehood.\\" Metal corsets for medical purposes continued to be used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater. 20th and 21st centuries Shaun Leane for Alexander McQueen, 1999. Since the 20th century, actual metal corsets have occasionally been made for contemporary wear, although such instances are rare. Steele notes that alongside a 1930s metal corset made for and worn by a fetish corsetiere called Cayne, the late 20th- and early 21st-century tight- lacer Cathie Jung had a silver corset-cover made to wear over her actual laced corset. Between 1933 and 1940 Mrs. Cayne advertised a booklet describing her 14-inch waistline and offered other services in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News. Plate 8 in the book is a photograph of Mrs. Cayne's corset. As a medical garment, metal corsets endured well into the 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, following ongoing problems as a result of a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports. 20th and 21st century designers have sometimes offered metal corsets and bodices as part of their presentations, including Alexander McQueen, Issey Miyake, and Thierry Mugler. One of McQueen's most famous pieces was a 1999 aluminium corset, called the Coiled Corset, created in collaboration with the jeweller Shaun Leane and the artist Kees van der Graaf. Built around a cast of the model Laura Morgan's torso, the garment had a 15-inch waist and was composed of 97 stacked coils, which had to be screwed together onto Morgan's body. The Coiled Corset was inspired by the neck rings worn by Ndebele women, extended to encase the wearer's torso. In 2001, the corset formed part of a live presentation at the Victoria and Albert Museum showcasing McQueen and Leane's collaborations. Corsets and bustiers can also be made using wire, such as a 1983 aluminium wire bustier by Miyake which was cuffed around the torso over a feathered garment, offering a pun on the theme of birdcages. In museums Metal corsets are found in a number of museum collections around the world. Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes. Others, such as the iron corset in the Fashion Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.

It has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978. The three-story building was designed by A. E. Doyle in an Italianate style and completed in 1925. The ground floor features a two-story-high grand room with ceilings. The building's original owner and occupant, the Bank of California, moved out around the end of 1969 and sold the building in 1970. It has had a succession of other owners and tenants since then. It was last used as a bank in 1977. Establishment and original use elevation of the main (west) façade in 2013. The entrance at the far left was a 1977 addition. The London and San Francisco Bank established a Portland branch in 1882. When the San Francisco-based Bank of California acquired and absorbed that institution in 1905, the branch became the first Bank of California branch in Portland. In 1924, officers of the bank approved plans to construct a new building for the Portland branch. Since about 1894, it had been located at Third and Stark Streets in downtown, in the Chamber of Commerce Building (demolished in 1934). Noted Portland architect A. E. Doyle was hired to design the new structure. Doyle's chief designer Charles K. Greene had traveled abroad to study Greco-Roman architectural forms in the 1910s. His research resulted in three Italianate buildings in Portland, of which the Bank of California Building was the first. The others were the Chicago/Italianate Pacific Building and the Public Service Building, an early skyscraper. While the Pacific and Public Service Buildings are large, multi- story structures, the three-story Bank of California Building is small. It has been described as being in the style of an Italian Renaissance palazzo (palace). Construction began in 1924, the building was completed in 1925 and opened on July 20 of that year. Description Exterior The central, original entrance features ornate bronzework on and around the gates covering the doors. The building occupies a site at the northeast corner of 6th Avenue and Stark Streets; it faces 6th. The main façade features five large, tall windows which are arched at the top. Above each is a smaller rectangular window at the second-floor level. The third floor is within the building's hipped roof and is windowless. The exterior is clad in cast terracotta with marble trim, and the roof is covered in red clay tiles. Terracotta is also used for the cornices. Two ornate bronze lamps flank the central entrance, similar in style to fixtures used on Portland's Doyle-designed Public Service Building of the same period. A bronze portico frames the bronze gates of the main entrance, located in the central arch of the five tall arches. For many years, this was the building's only entrance. However, in 1977, during work to modify the building for non-banking uses, a second entrance was built in the northernmost arch of the main façade, accessing a new, smaller lobby and providing more direct access to the upper floors, . One of two bronze lanterns flanking the main entrance Originally, the building's north side was directly adjacent to the six-story Fenton Building (also known as the Guaranty Building), obscured from view, and was not given any decorative surface when built. However, following that building's demolition in 1971, the Bank of California Building's newly exposed north façade was resurfaced in cast terracotta in a pattern simulating that of the west and south façades. A surface parking lot took the Fenton Building's place, and a drive-up teller window was added to the building's north end; this addition was the only substantial alteration to the building's exterior between its completion in 1925 and its nomination to the National Register in 1978. The drive-up window was removed in 1977, after the building's use as a bank ended. In 1980, the parking lot gave way to a new 13-story office building known as the TN Building. It was converted into a 16-story hotel in 2008, the Marriott-owned Courtyard Portland City Center, leaving the north façade hidden from view again. Interior In addition to three main floors, the building has a mezzanine situated between the first (ground) and second floors. At the time of the building's opening in 1925, the windowless third floor was not fully outfitted for use, and was planned to be \\"held in reserve\\" until then- anticipated expansion of the bank's business in Portland created a need for additional work space. It was eventually equipped \\"as a lounge, library, and recreation space for the bank's employees\\". A basement was also included. It housed the bank vaults (of which there are three), among other facilities. The ground floor was occupied by the main banking room, with a line of teller windows along the east side. It was designed as a \\"grand two-story room with ornate coffered beam ceilings\\", which are high. The mezzanine was originally situated only along the north side and is wide there. The floor of the former banking lobby is marble, as were the teller counters (since removed). Most other interior surfaces are cast materials made to simulate travertine marble. Along with removal of the line of teller windows, other work undertaken during the 1977 modifications included an extension of the mezzanine southwards along the east wall to the south wall, and the addition of a freestanding stairway between it and the center of the ground-floor lobby. Immediate surroundings Portland Mall bus-stop shelter that stood in front of the building for 30 years. The lettering on the main façade at that time was for Bidwell & Co. (which had moved out in 2004). The northbound Portland Transit Mall passes in front of the building. During the mall's construction in 1976–77 the plain cement sidewalk in front of the building was resurfaced in brick, and street trees were added. A large shelter for the new bus stop that was installed there at that time was removed when the mall was rebuilt in 2007–08. MAX light rail trains have passed in front of the building since 2009. Since completion of a renovation of the transit mall in 2009, the bronze sculpture Talos No. 2 has stood in front of the building, near the corner of 6th and Stark. The Bank of California Building stands directly across 6th Avenue from another A. E. Doyle-designed bank building, the United States National Bank Building, of 1917. That building's classical style contrasts sharply with the Bank of California Building's Italianate design. Post-1960s owners or primary tenants The Bank of California remained at the site for almost 45 years until moving west by just over one block to a new 15-story high-rise building in December 1969. It also took the name Bank of California Building, or tower and was renamed the Union Bank of California Building after a 1996 merger. It was then occupied, in turn, by Security Bank of Oregon, the Oregon Bank, and insurance company Durham & Bates, Inc. The end of the building's use as a bank took place around 1977, when it was sold to Bankside Investors, to be leased to Durham & Bates. The prominent lettering on the main façade was usually changed with each transfer, being altered to read SECURITY BANK OF OREGON in 1970 and to read DURHAM & BATES after that company moved into the building. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 1978. Bidwell & Company, a Portland-based stock brokerage firm, purchased the building in November 1999 and launched an intensive nine-month renovation in 2000. Bidwell moved into the building in November 2000 and renamed it the Bidwell & Co. Building. The main façade's lettering was changed again. Bidwell & Company was sold to Ameritrade in January 2004, and the building was vacated. In late 2006, when the building was owned by a California investment firm, its owners were still looking for a replacement tenant for Bidwell. In 2008, the building was renamed the Three Kings Building.

It was first published in 1916Buttel, p. 219. and is therefore in the public domain. Bates takes this poem to signify that the author of \\"A High-Toned Old Christian Woman\\" was not altogether \\"the village atheist\\". The palace is a church, inhabited by believers for whom the walker has slight regard. They are immature if innocent \\"babies\\" nourished on dreams. But disbelief brings loss, as the last two stanzas imply. Night for the moonlight walker brings the harsh torment of crows' wings, not the agreeable angels' wings that animate the dreams of the believers.Bates, 209. Bates compares the disbeliever to the rationalist in the sixth of \\"Six Significant Landscapes\\", who trims his thinking to the cut of his hat. Bates suggests that the poem undermines Fuchs's thesis that Stevens's wit is directed mainly at fictions which have failed him,Fuchs, p. 30.Bates, p. 208. In support of Fuchs, however, one might think that the poem simply acknowledges the loss that attends a perspective that has been stripped of such failed fictions. The solitary walker is \\"The Snow Man\\", with a mind of winter. Bates interprets Stevens as influenced by William James's doctrine of the will to believe. \\"Between dogmatic belief and dogmatic disbelief,\\" Bates writes, \\"James had cleared the ground for precursive faith, a willingness to believe. It was this position that Stevens occupied until about 1940, when he adopted a more active posture of voluntary or willed belief.\\" There are two questionable suggestions here. One is that the more active posture is not implied by James's will-to- believe doctrine. The other is that \\"precursive faith\\" is leading Stevens back to the beliefs of the babies. Stevens wants an object of belief that is informed by poetic imagination, and he is prepared to name such a belief a \\"fiction\\", as in \\"Asides on the Oboe\\" (1940). > The prologues are over. It is a question, now, Of final belief. So, say that > final belief Must be in a fiction. It is time to choose. Bates reads this as an extreme voluntarism that sanctions believing what one knows to be false, but a less tendentious reading would reject classification of such beliefs as true or false. Rather, they are informed by the perspective revealed by the poet's imagination. A more appropriate binary than true/false is insightful/not-insightful.  Notes   References  *Bates, Milton J.

From the time of its founding until the 1950s, it was the only legal whiskey distillery in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The primary brands produced by the distillery were the Virginia Gentleman and Fairfax County bourbon whiskeys.

The historic building The building in which the distillery originally operated was constructed circa 1892 under the guidance of Dr. C.A. Max Wiehle, a physician from Philadelphia who retired from practice at the age of 41 and tried to establish a town and farming community known as Wiehle on 3,228 acres of land he purchased in 1882. The first floor served as the Wiehle town hall, and the second floor housed the Wiehle Methodist Episcopal church. The building originally featured an 80 lb bell and a steeple, which were later removed to satisfy community concerns over having a distillery with the appearance of a church. The movement to build the town foundered after the death of Dr. Wiehle from pneumonia in 1901, and the building ceased to serve as a town hall in 1909. The church had moved elsewhere in 1907. For a time, the building then became a single-family residence and general store, until purchased by Abram Smith Bowman in 1927 as part of a 4,000-acre parcel called Sunset Hills. Bowman would later make an additional 3,240-acre purchase of what was known as the Dunn Tract in 1947 – creating the largest privately owned property in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, which would remain so until nearly all of the land was sold to a real estate company in 1960. After a brief transitional ownership by the real estate company, a 60-acre area containing the distillery was sold back to Bowman's sons Abram Smith, Jr., and Delong. Bowman, born in Mercer County, Kentucky in 1868, established a distillery in 1934 on the day after Prohibition was repealed, and the building originally served as the warehouse of the distillery. The first bourbon produced by the distillery was shipped from the warehouse in 1937. Between 1934 and some point in the 1950s, Bowman's was the only legal whiskey distillery in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service in 1999, and has been the subject of several rezoning applications. A proposal to construct condominiums on the site was approved September 24, 2007. An earlier version of the proposal mentioned 8 units as new buildings (on 0.23 acres), in addition to constructing 3 units within the historic structure, while noting that it replaced a planned use of the structure as a cultural center (i.e., for the Greater Reston Arts Center). It is located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Old Reston Avenue and Sunset Hills Road, and has the address 1875 Old Reston Avenue, Reston, VA, 20190.

He served as the Archivist of the Secret Archives of the Vatican, in the course of which he became a leading agent in the revival of Thomism in the teachings of the Catholic Church.Cardinal Deaconry S. Cesareo in Palatio GCatholic.org Early years and formation He was born in Isny im Allgäu in the Kingdom of Württemberg, the son of Franz Ehrle, a physician, and Berta von Frölich. He was educated at the Jesuit school Stella Matutina in Feldkirch. He joined the Society of Jesus on 20 September 1861. After completing the two years of his novitiate program of formation at Groheim, Hohenzollern, he followed the course of humanities at the College of Friedricksburg in Münster, and later at the Jesuit college at Maria Laach Abbey, where he studied philosophy (1865–1868). For the regency phase of his training in the Society of Jesus, from 1868-1873 Ehrle was sent to teach at his old secondary school, Stella Matutina, where he taught English, French and philosophy. Because of an anti-Jesuit policy that followed the publication of the Kulturkampf in Germany, Ehrle, along with other German companions, had to carry on his studies abroad. He did his studies in theology at Ditton Hall, the Jesuit seminary in Liverpool, England (1873–1877). After being ordained a priest on 24 September 1876 in Liverpool, Ehrle did pastoral work in a home for the poor at Preston, Lancashire, before being transferred in 1878 to Tervuren, Belgium, where the German Jesuit periodical Stimmen aus Maria-Laach (Voices from Maria Laach) had established its office in exile, to serve as its editor. Working in the Vatican Archives When Pope Leo XIII opened the Vatican Secret Archives in 1880, Erhle was called to Rome to do research on the official correspondence between the Holy See and Germany during the Thirty Years War. The work progressed very slowly as a large number of documents were as yet lacking detailed catalogs. Ehrle became more and more involved, but, responding to Pope Leo's call for a renewal in Thomistic studies, his interests shifted to gathering and cataloging books and manuscripts relating to scholasticism. To do so he visited other European libraries. Publications began in 1885 with the Bibliotheca Theologiae et Philosophiae Scholasticae selectae (5 volumes). In the beginning of 1890 he began the publication of a Historia Bibliothecae Romanorum Pontificum, a comprehensive history of the papal libraries from both Avignon and Rome. In September of that same year (1890), Ehrle was made a member extraordinary of the Board of Councilors of the Vatican Library, serving from 1890 to 1895, after which he served as its prefect until 1914. In 1898 (30 September-1 October), Ehrle organized an international conference on the preservation of manuscripts at the Swiss Abbey of St Gall. As a result of the conference, a committee was established: * to study the processes of preservation that had been suggested and to recommend those which seem appropriate, * to publish the processes of preservation discussed at the conference, * to liaise with libraries and technical experts. Ehrle published an account of the meetingFranz Ehrle, Die internationale Konferenz in St Gallen am 30 September und 1 October 1898 zur Beratung über die Erhaltung und Ausbesserung alter Handschriften, Centralblatt fur Bibliothekswesen, 16 (1899) 27-51 and the proceedings were also published.Otto Posse, Handschriften-Konservirung nach den Verhandlungen der St Gallener Internationalen Konferenz zur Erhaltung und Ausbesserung alter Handschriften von 1898 sowie der Dresdener Konferenz Deutscher Archivare von 1899, Dresden, 1899 This conference was particularly important as the first international meeting of those charged with the preservation of the historical heritage. Nothing similar took place again until the 1930s when the international museum committee of the League of Nations organized conservation conferences in Rome, Paris and Athens. Modernization of the Vatican Library Under Ehrle's direction the printed books housed in the Appartamento Borgia were consolidated and moved to be stored with the main library collection. His measures of reorganization allowed for research scholars to finally have access to the public reference collection. Ehrle also worked to have reference librarians available to assist researchers. Extending the library's hours of operation to meet the needs of researchers, he opened to them use of the entire catalog, and eased restrictions on scholars' use and research of Vatican library treasures. Ehrle's efforts to meet the needs of researchers led to increase use of the Vatican Library and in 1910 a reading room was created in space formerly occupied by the Vatican printworks. This change also improved readers' access to the stacks. Ehrle also began a descriptive cataloging project for the Vatican Library's collection that he projected would take 80 to 100 years to complete. Ehrle's forward thinking nature also led him to introduce the use of photography to preserve endangered manuscripts before other libraries began the practice. Such photographical techniques also permitted researchers increased access to information on manuscripts. Ehrle sought not only to provide for the protection and repair of Vatican manuscripts, but also to make available the facilities of Vatican workshops to aid in preserving endangered manuscripts from around the world.Dummer, E. Heyse. (1946). \\"Cardinal Franz Ehrle: In Commemoration of a Double Anniversary\\". The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy.Vol 16. No. 4 October 1946. pp. 335-340. //www.jstor.org/stable/4303519 Accessed 11-04-2019. Ehrle resided in Münich from 1918 to 1919. Returning then to Rome, he served as a faculty member of the Pontifical Biblical Institute until 1922 and of the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was promoted to the office of Cardinal Deacon by Pope Pius XI at the papal consistory of 11 December 1922, and given the Titular church of San Cesareo in Palatio. He died on 31 March 1934 in Rome at the age of 88. For the last year of his life, he had been the oldest member of the College of Cardinals. He was buried in the Campo Verano.

They closed in 1925. History and description By the time Grand Junction was three years old, it had become apparent to its citizens that they needed a good coal supply if the town were to grow and prosper. Early in 1884 an experienced coal miner named George W. Smith set out to locate a mine that would adequately supply the city's needs. In a remote and unexplored canyon of the Book Cliffs twelve miles from town he found a huge body of coal. Smith and several other men developed the discovery into what became known as the Book Cliff Mine. Two years later another coal mine was opened a half a mile north of the Book Cliff coal mine; it was called the Grand Valley Mine. Both mines were purchased by William Thomas Carpenter in the summer of 1888, and under his Grand Valley Fuel Company they were improved and further developed. He built the Little Book Cliff Railway to serve the mines. A small community of miners took root nearby. The U.S. post office established a branch there during June 1890, officially dubbing the settlement Carpenter, Colorado. One of Carpenter's first improvements was the installation of a gravity powered tramway (known as a funicular) at each of the mines. Cars traveled the incline between the mine adit and coal tipple on three rail tracks (except at the passing point, where four rails were used). The mechanics of the trams were simple; one end of a wire rope was attached to the car at the mine and the other end to the car at the tipple. Between the two cars the rope was wound around a drum and brake mechanism located above the mine adit. The weight of the loaded car traveling down was thus used to return an empty car from the tipple to the mine. When Isaac Chauncy Wyman acquired the Book Cliff company in January 1899, he installed his nephew William Stanley Phillips as manager. Phillips proved to be as concerned and capable a lieutenant as Wyman could have hoped for. Following the turn of the century the mines developed serious problems. The Grand Valley Mine was running out of coal and in the Book Cliff Mine the slope of the vein had become so steep that it was rapidly becoming impractical to work the mine. Phillips began a new mine, south of the Book Cliff Mine in Coal Mesa, which he hoped would produce a mine with unlimited potential. The prospect mine failed and the only choice he had was to tunnel through of sandstone (beneath the original Book Cliff Mine) into the vein at a lower, workable level. This was finally accomplished in 1905 and is today the mine that has \\"Carpenter\\" cut into the stone over the adit. Production resumed and all went well until Phillips died in late 1915. Princeton University then managed the mine in absentia but the life had gone out of the company and it began deteriorating slowly. Early in July 1923 the mine caught fire. Princeton was forced to spend large sums of money in unsuccessful attempts to extinguish the fire. With coal usage falling off in favor of natural gas, and paved highways for motor trucks creating competition from local farmer mines, Princeton decided that it wanted out of the coal business. The decision was made to abandon the mine, town, and railroad in 1925. Three Grand Junction teenagers suffocated to death while exploring the Book Cliff Mine on August 13, 1989. Following the incident the mine adit was permanently sealed. References *Lampert, Lyndon J.; Robert W. McLeod. Little Book Cliff Railway: The Life and Times of a Colorado Narrow Gauge.

The concept appears to have originated in the study of philosophy and literature as a technique to more fully comprehend and appreciate a complex text. More recently, there has been increased interest in slow reading as result of the slow movement and its focus on decelerating the pace of modern life.  Related terms  The use of slow reading in literary criticism is sometimes referred to as close reading. Of less common usage is the term, \\"deep reading\\".Birkerts, Sven. (1994). The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age. Boston: Faber and Faber. Selected passages, Open Book Systems] Slow reading is contrasted with speed reading which involves techniques to increase the rate of reading without adversely affecting comprehension, and contrasted with skimming which employs visual page cues to increase reading speed.  Philosophy and literature  The earliest reference to slow reading appears to be in Nietzsche's preface to the 1887 Daybreak: \\"It is not for nothing that one has been a philologist, perhaps one is a philologist still, that is to say, a teacher of slow reading.\\"Friedrich Nietzsche, (1887) Morgenro:te: Gedanken u:ber die moralischen Vorurteile (1881). \\"Man ist nicht umsonst Philologe gewesen, man ist es vielleicht noch, das will sagen, ein Lehrer des langsamen Lesens: - endlich schreibt man auch langsam.\\"Nietzsche, Friedrich (1887)Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality. 2nd Edition. Birkerts, in his book The Gutenberg Elegies, stated \\"Reading, because we control it, is adaptable to our needs and rhythms. We are free to indulge our subjective associative impulse; the term I coin for this is deep reading: the slow and meditative possession of a book.\\" Birkerts' emphasis on the importance of personal control over the speed of reading is echoed by Pullman, who additionally argued that taking control of the pace of one's reading is a form of personal freedom, and develops an appreciation of democracy.Pullman, P. (2004). The War on Words. Guardian Review, November 6, 2004. On-line A similar view was stated by Postman, who noted the character of the ordinary citizen of the 19th century, a mind that could listen for hours on end to political orations clearly shaped by a culture favouring text. Postman warns that reading books is important for developing rational thinking and political astuteness.Postman, Neil (1985). Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. NY: Penguin. Lindsay Waters, Executive Editor for the Humanities at Harvard University Press, declared a worldwide reading crisis resulting from our global push toward productivity. He asserts that young children are learning to read faster, skipping phonetics and diagramming sentences, and concludes that these children will not grow up to read Milton. He foresees the end of graduate English literature programs. \\"There is something similar between a reading method that focuses primarily on the bottom-line meaning of a story in a novel and the economic emphasis on the bottom line that makes automobile manufacturers speed up assembly lines.\\" He advised re-introducing time into reading: \\"The mighty imperative is to speed everything up, but there might be some advantage in slowing things down. People are trying slow eating. Why not slow reading?\\" Waters, Lindsay (2007), Time for Reading, Chronicle of Higher Education, 53(23). On-line (subscription required) Slow movement Carl Honoré, an advocate of the slow movement, discusses slow reading in his book In Praise of Slow.Honoré, Carl (2004). [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb0_TtNFwPYC In Praise of Slow: How a Worldwide Movement is Changing the Cult of Speed]. Vintage Canada. pages 227-229 He recommends slow reading as one of several practices to decelerate from the fast pace of modern life.Jennings, Lane (2005). Slow Is Beautiful: Living as If Life Really Mattered. Futurist, 39(2) (Mar/Apr 2005): p. 12-13. Laura Casey points out that the increasing availability of instant communication technologies, such as texting and social media like Facebook and Twitter, may be contributing to the decline of slow reading.Casey, Laura (January 5, 2011). Is deep reading in trouble?Contra Costa Times. In 2008, novelist I. Alexander Olchowski founded the Slow Book Movement to advocate for reading practices related to the slow movement, including reading light material at a relaxed pace for pleasure, reading complex materials slowly for insight, reading materials of local interest and by local authors, and community building around local libraries and reading events.  Research  While there is substantial research about involuntary slow reading, which can arise from a lack of fluency and is a predictor of dyslexia,Wimmer, Heinz (1996). \\"The Early Manifestation of Developmental Dyslexia: Evidence from German children\\". Reading and Writing, 8(2). there are a few studies which demonstrate the positive value of voluntary slow reading. Nell (1988) showed that there is substantial rate variability during natural reading, with most- liked pages being read significantly slower.Nell, V. (1988). The Psychology of Reading for Pleasure: Needs and Gratifications. Reading Research Quarterly, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 6-50. Sherry Jr. and Schouten (2002) suggested that close reading could have commercial application as a research method for the use of poetry in marketing.Sherry, John F, Jr. and Schouten John W. (2002). A Role for Poetry in Consumer Research. Journal of Consumer Research, 29(2), 218-234. Advocates of speed-reading point out that subvocalization slows the speed of reading, but studies by Carver found no other observable negative effect on the reading process, and observed that the slower pace seemed to improve comprehension.Carver, Ronald, P.

He was born in Spartias, a small village of the mountainous area of Trichonis in Aetolia- Acarnania in Greece. He entered the Hellenic Military Academy in Athens and then went to France for supplementary studies at the École supérieure de guerre. Upon the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912, he was recalled from his studies in Paris, and placed in the staff of the 4th Infantry Division under Major General Konstantinos Moschopoulos. From this position, he participated in the battle of Sarantaporo and the drive to Thessaloniki. In December 1912, he suggested to Lt General Konstantinos Sapountzakis, and then to the Crown Prince Constantine the idea of capturing the strategic hill of Tsouka, west of the fortress of Bizani that was blocking the Greek advance towards Ioannina. In the battle of Bizani, the hill was captured, leading to the liberation on February 21, 1913 of Ioannina. During the Second Balkan War, Kalogeras fought in the battle of Kilkis-Lahanas. During World War I, he served as chief of staff of the 2nd Infantry Division, and later as vice-chief of staff to the General Headquarters in Smyrna in February 1920. In March 1920 he was transferred to the Army of Thrace under Lt General Emmanouil Zymvrakakis. He resigned from the Army in August 1923 and settled in Athens, where he witnessed the royalist Leonardopoulos-Gargalidis coup attempt. Kalogeras formed a force of 3000 volunteers in Athens, and participated in the suppression of the coup in Macedonia and Epirus. Thus, he contributed to the fall of monarchy and the declaration of the Second Hellenic Republic. He then entered the political arena, and was elected a Member of Parliament for Athens, a post to which he was continually re-elected December 1930. In 1930 he became Minister General Director of Thrace, contributing to the organisation of Western Thrace.

The Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden had re-routed the mouth of the river in 1626, to improve drainage, and the new works included provision for navigation, but the scheme did not solve the problem of flooding, and the Dutch River was cut in 1635 to link the new channel to Goole. The first Act of Parliament to improve navigation on the river was obtained in 1726, by a group of Cutlers based in Sheffield; the Corporation of Doncaster obtained an Act in the following year for improvements to the lower river. Locks and lock cuts were built, and, by 1751, the river was navigable to Tinsley. The network was expanded by the opening of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1802, linking to the River Trent, the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1804, linking to Barnsley, and the Sheffield Canal in 1819, which provided better access to Sheffield. All three were bought out by the Don Navigation in the 1840s, after which the canals were owned by a series of railway companies. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company was created in 1889 and eventually succeeded in buying back the canals and the Don Navigation in 1895, but plans for expansion were hampered by a lack of capital. One success was the opening of the New Junction Canal in 1905, jointly funded with the Aire and Calder Navigation. During the 20th century, there were several plans to upgrade the Don, to handle larger craft. It was eventually upgraded to take 700-tonne barges in 1983, but the scheme was a little too late, as an anticipated rise in commercial traffic did not occur. Most use of the navigation is now by leisure boaters, whose boats are dwarfed by the huge locks. The navigation and river are crossed by a wide variety of bridges, from a medieval bridge complete with a chapel on it, one of only three to have survived in Britain, to a motorway viaduct that pioneered the use of rubber bearings and a new waterproofing system. In between are a number of railway bridges, including two that were built to carry the internal railway system at the Blackburn Meadows sewage treatment plant. The former railway viaduct at Conisbrough now carries cyclists above the Don, as part of the National Cycle Network. The final section to Bramwith is known as the River Dun Navigation. Early history Before 1626 the River Don had two outlets, an eastern branch that meandered across Hatfield Chase to enter the River Trent, and a northern branch, which was a Roman navigation channel, and joined the River Aire at Turnbridge, near East Cowick. Cornelius Vermuyden's drainage scheme for Hatfield Chase, begun in 1626 and largely completed by 1628, included the construction of Ashfield Bank, which ran for along the southern bank of the Don from Fishlake to Thorne, cutting off the eastern branch. Navigation to Sandtoft was made possible by the provision of a navigable sluice in the bank, which had lifting gates and a lock chamber. A further bank some distance to the east of the northern channel ran for from Thorne to Turnbridge to provide washlands, which would flood when high levels in the Aire prevented the Don discharging into it. In the winter of 1628, there was flooding at Fishlake and Sykehouse, which was followed by rioting. A navigable sluice was built at Turnbridge in 1629, with a lock , and an outfall sluice called the \\"Great Sluice\\" was completed in 1630, probably by Hugo Spiering, who had assisted Vermuyden with the main project. Continued problems with flooding led to the construction of a channel from Newbridge near Thorne eastwards to Goole, where water levels in the Ouse were between lower than at Turnbridge. The channel, called the Dutch River, ended in another outfall sluice, and was completed in 1635 at a cost of £33,000. Boats continued to use the lock at Turnbridge. In about 1688 the Goole sluice was washed away by a flood, and was never replaced. The tidal scour widened the channel, and barges of up to 30 tonnes could normally reach Fishlake, and often Wilsick House, in Barnby Dun. Smaller boats could reach Doncaster for most of the year, and large barges could do so when there was a flood tide. Initial attempts to seek powers to make the River Don navigable were hampered by opposition from local landowners and disunity between the authorities in Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster. The first Act of Parliament was presented in 1698 by the MP for Thirsk, Sir Godfrey Copley of Sprotborough, representing the interests of Rotherham. Although there was support from the \\"gentlemen, traders and inhabitants\\" of Doncaster, the Corporation opposed the Bill in view of the likely impact on their mills. There was no support from Sheffield either, and the Bill failed at its first reading. In 1704 Doncaster Corporation, with the support of its traders, presented a Bill that received a first reading, but disappeared without a second reading ever happening. By 1722 there was some agreement between Sheffield and Doncaster, with a tacit agreement that Doncaster would be responsible for the river below their town, and Sheffield for the section above Doncaster. There was organised resistance to the scheme from local landowners, and it appears that their influence resulted in the proposed Bill being defeated in committee, so it could not be presented to parliament. However, in 1726 Sheffield's Company of Cutlers sought parliamentary approval to make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, on the edge of Sheffield. Terminating at Tinsley placated the Duke of Norfolk, who represented the opposition from Sheffield, and a great deal of work had been done to reduce the opposition from landowners. The Act of Parliament was passed on 6 May 1726 giving the Cutlers powers to make cuts and to make the river deeper and wider so that boats of 20 tons could reach Tinsley. There were a number of restrictions, intended to protect existing water-powered installations. Lord Frederick Howard's mills at Rotherham, Kilnhurst forge, Thrybergh dam and Sprotborough mills and water engine were specifically mentioned. The Corporation of Doncaster sought powers in 1727 to improve the river below Holmstile, as far as Wilsick House in Barnby Dun. The Bill passed through parliament uneventfully, and again included detailed restrictions on what could and could not be done, designed to protect the landowners. The details were very specific in that they included the permissible heights of dams, the maximum length of cuts, and many other details of the work to be carried out. Both Acts were unusual in that they gave the bodies powers to borrow money, but did not create the companies to do the work. Nor were the financial arrangements clearly laid down, and both groups resorted to issuing shares to fund the improvements, although they were not actually empowered to do so. In October 1730, the two groups decided to amalgamate, but a 1731 Act to formalise the agreement and legalise the issuing of shares was defeated because it also included powers to make further changes to the river, including the section below Barnby Dun. Finally an Act of 1733 created The Company of the Proprietors of the Navigation of the River Don, with powers to create a new cut from Bromley Sands above Rotherham to Ickles Dam. The problems presented by the river below Wilsick House, including shallows and fords at Bramwith and Stainforth, and bridges on the Dutch River that were difficult to navigate, resulted in the proprietors trying again to obtain powers to improve the lower river in 1737, but again the petition was defeated in a parliamentary committee. Work continued, and it appears that Aldwarke was the head of navigation for some years, but Rotherham was reached in 1740. A further Bill in 1740 sought powers to improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which included the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was not completed until 1822. In 1737, the navigation was leased to three of the company shareholders for 14 years, and a new 7-year lease was made in 1751. After 1758, the company managed the navigation itself. Tolls for the next 10 years raised an average of £7006 per annum, indicating healthy traffic levels. Expansion The early 19th century saw the completion of a number of canals which linked to the Don. The first was the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, which had been proposed by the Don Navigation shareholders in 1792. Construction was started in 1793 and completed in 1802, with John Thompson, the engineer to the Don Navigation Company, overseeing the work until his death in 1795. It provided a link from Bramwith Lock to the River Trent, broadly following the old course of the River Don prior to Vermuyden's improvements. Two years later, the Dearne and Dove Canal opened, connecting with the Barnsley Canal near Barnsley. The canal had also been proposed by Don Navigation shareholders in 1792, and again John Thompson had overseen the initial construction. The third opening was in 1819, when the Sheffield Canal connected the Tinsley terminus to the centre of Sheffield. There were several plans to create a link to the Chesterfield Canal, including one in 1793 by Benjamin Outram, and a proposal by Richard Gresley in 1810 for a North East Junction Canal, which would have linked to the Don at Rotherham, broadly following the modern ideas for the Rother Link. Neither of these, nor a revival of the idea in 1832 gained sufficient support to proceed. The Company bought out the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1846, the Sheffield Canal in 1848, and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1849. They then amalgamated with the South Yorkshire, Doncaster and Goole Railway in 1850, to become the South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company. This in turn was leased to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1864. In order to allow an extension of the railway from Mexborough to Sheffield to pass under the railway line to Rotherham Westgate railway station, the Holmes cut below Ickles lock was diverted into the river, and the Eastwood cut below Rotherham lock was diverted to the east in 1864. The original bed was then filled in and the railway built along its course. Despite attempts to divert coal traffic to the railway, the canals maintained their traffic levels, carrying 982,000 tonnes in 1878 and 927,254 in 1888. However, there was dissatisfaction among users of the canals that the rates for traffic were higher than on the railways, and the canals were failing to modernise, as steam boats were banned, despite them having been in use for 50 years on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation. A plan to upgrade the waterways to allow the use of 300 to 500-tonne boats led to the formation of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited in November 1888. The cost of the scheme was estimated to be around £1 million, in addition to the cost of acquiring the canals from the railway company. The new company obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5 million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation, or by compulsory purchase if negotiations failed. The railway company was unwilling to sell, and it was not until 1895, after protracted negotiation and legal battles that the transfer was agreed. The Navigation Company had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than the purchase price of the canals, and therefore the railway company nominated half of the ten directors, while the Aire and Calder Company declined to buy any shares because of railway influence. Many of the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system were hindered by a lack of capital, although some further developments took place. One improvement that was completed was the construction of the New Junction Canal. This had been authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 28 July 1891 by the Aire and Calder Navigation, which specified that the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company would share the cost of construction and the ownership of the new waterway. No work could start until the company actually owned their canals, and they were required to raise £150,000 at a time when they had just failed to raise the finance for the takeover of the original canals. However, three-quarters of the cost had been raised by 1903. The new canal leaves the original navigation at Bramwith Junction, runs over the River Don on an aqueduct, and continues in a straight line for , to join the Aire and Calder Navigation upstream from Goole. It provided a much more direct route from Sheffield to Goole, and was opened on 2 January 1905. The company had hoped to run compartment boats for the transport of coal along the canal, as the Aire and Calder did, but although straightening of the navigation was completed at Doncaster in April 1905 and at Sprotborough in late 1907, and Doncaster Town Lock was lengthened in 1909 and 1910, most of the locks could only hold three compartments at a time, and so there was little advantage to using this type of boat. Later developments The weir near Aldwarke Lock Towards the end of the First World War, Sheffield City Council proposed a major upgrade of the navigation. They expected the government to nationalise the waterway, and pay for the improvements, to which they would contribute, providing that the railway influence was removed. The scheme involved deepening the channel from to , and constructing 18 new locks which would be , to replace the existing locks. The locks would have multiple gates, and be capable of holding four 110-tonne barges or one 300-tonne barge. The estimated cost was £1,483,426, but the government was unwilling to support the scheme, and Sheffield City Council was not prepared to proceed without government backing. During the inter-war years the navigation struggled to hold its own against competition from the railways and later the roads, and was affected by miners' strikes in the coal industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, the year of the general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, but much of the latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did not increase correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith Lock on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while straightening of a stretch near Doncaster and the construction of a new warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934. The major traffic on the navigation had always been coal, but after the Second World War there was a steady increase in oil traffic. By 1946, all of the mortgages that the company had used to fund expansion were repaid, and the financial position of the canal gradually improved. Control of the navigation, as with most British canals, passed to the British Transport Commission on 1 January 1948, under the terms of the Transport Act (1947). Some improvements continued to be made, with two coal wharfs being built at Mexborough in 1954, to serve the new Doncaster power station, and Long Sandall Lock being extended to . The new lock was opened on 10 July 1959, and allowed trains of 17 compartment boats to work through to Doncaster and Hexthorpe, as Doncaster Town Lock above it and Sykehouse Lock below it on the New Junction Canal were already of a similar size. In 1961, the British Transport Commission, together with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a £2.5 million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then have been the same size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, although some of the bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a £2 million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment. Finally, the navigation was the subject of one of the last major attempts in the UK to attract commercial freight to the waterways. In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard by deepening the channels and enlarging the locks as far as Rotherham. Conisbrough lock was removed altogether, and the two Eastwood locks were combined into one. The new lock was initially named the Sir Frank Price Lock, after the chairman of the British Waterways Board who formally opened it on 1 June 1983. The expected rise in freight traffic did not occur, however. At Kilnhurst and Long Sandall, the new larger locks were built alongside the original locks, and so a comparison of the relative sizes can be made. The new locks are , and the navigation accommodates boats with a draught of and needing headroom of . Beyond Rotherham, the locks are , and so can accommodate a broad boat, but Rotherham lock is smaller, being only long, and so the upper reaches are effectively restricted to boats. Route The Straddle Warehouse, Victoria Quays (formerly the Sheffield Basin), Sheffield City Centre The River Don Navigation ended at Tinsley Wharf, but it forms a convenient place to start a description of the route. The wharf was on the river, just upstream from the present junction with the canal to Sheffield. It was close to the site of the Meadowhall Shopping Centre and the Tinsley Viaduct, which carries the M1 motorway over the valley of the River Don. From here there is a towpath along the canal to Victoria Quays (formerly Sheffield Basin) in Sheffield City Centre,Ordnance Survey, 1:50,000 map or the Five Weirs Walk follows the course of the River Don to the same destination.Five Weirs Walk The towpath extends to Rotherham in the opposite direction, passing the large Jordans Weir and the three locks on the Holmes Cut. Beside Jordans Weir is the outfall from Blackburn Meadows sewage treatment plant. In dry weather, this discharges 30 million gallons (136,000 m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river. The towpath continues to Rotherham Lock, where the Rotherham cut starts, but from here to Conisbrough, the only way to see the navigation is from a boat or from one of the bridges which cross it. To the north of the cut are the remains of the Greasbrough Canal, now culverted under the embankment of the A633 road. Eastwood lock marks the end of the Rotherham Cut, to be followed by Aldwarke Lock, in the shadow of the A6123 road bridge, and Kilnhurst flood lock, which marks the start of the Kilnhurst Cut. In Swinton, the stub of the Dearne and Dove Canal turns off to the left, and there are three more locks before the cut ends. Immediately following this, the River Dearne flows into the Don, and the towpath resumes, where the Dearne Way footpath ends. Two narrow boats dwarfed by the size of Sprotbrough Lock The route continues through a wooded valley, past the site of the Sprotborough Flash Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with the towpath forming part of the Trans Pennine Trail.Trans Pennine Trail Sprotborough lock and weir are situated just before Sprotborough. Just below the lock on the north bank are the remains of an engine house, built in the 1690s for Sir Godfrey Copley of Sprotborough Hall. A water wheel pumped river water some upwards to supply a fountain in the grounds of the hall, a swimming pool, and also provided a water supply for the village. The pump was powered by a water wheel which was removed in the 1970s. Soon the edge of Doncaster is reached, where amongst the railway marshalling yards, the River Don leaves the navigation for the final time, as does the towpath. The two weir streams flow either side of Doncaster prison, effectively forming an island on which the building sits. Doncaster Town Lock is situated close to Doncaster railway station, and between here and Long Sandall Lock, some of the changes which have occurred over the years can be visualised, with the river on the left and ox-bow lakes on the right, severed by the course of the Wheatley Cut. The final section to Bramwith is usually called the River Dun Navigation. At Bramwith, the waterway splits, with the New Junction Canal heading north-east for the Aire and Calder Navigation and Goole, and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal heading east to the River Trent at Keadby. The River Don heads northwards too, turning to the east where the Dutch River starts at Newbridge. The original course to the River Aire can be traced across the fields, now little more than a drainage ditch crossed by an oversized Grade II listed bridge on the A1041 at East Cowick, and Vermuyden's embankments are closely followed by the A614 road after it has crossed the M18 motorway. Structures This section provides details of some of the many bridges crossing the Don Navigation, in west-to-east order, starting from Tinsley. Tinsley and Rotherham area MS&L; railway bridge This bridge, which is located a little below the junction of the Sheffield Canal and the river, carries the Sheffield to Rotherham freight-only railway line. The railway, which opened in 1868, was originally part of the Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway, which later became part of the Great Central Railway. Between this railway bridge and Jordan Bridge, there are two bridges carrying pipes. Jordan Bridge Jordan Bridge Called \\"Jordan Bridge 21\\" by British Waterways, this bridge carried a railway that linked Blackburn Meadows Sewage Works to additional filters and contact beds to the east of the navigation. It was constructed by Logan and Hemmingway, who won a contract valued at £41,046 in April 1907, which included six settling tanks, 24 contact beds, and the bridge. The eastern approach consists of three brick arches, which allowed a siding to pass through it. Continued expansion of the works required a second bridge to be constructed in 1922, to carry the railway over the river channel. The steelwork for Holmes bridge was supplied by Charles Ross Ltd, who were based in Sheffield, while piling work was carried out by Yorkshire Hennebique Concreting Co Ltd. Holmes Lock Bridge This carries Steel Street – a minor road linking the Blackburn Meadows Nature Reserve Car Park with Holmes. The bridge still has railway tracks embedded in part of the cobbled road surface. The tracks were part of a network of sidings which served the Holmes Rolling Mills on the north bank of the navigation, and the bridge provided access to a crushing plant situated on the island formed by the course of the river to the south and the Holmes Cut to the north.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1938 edition Midland Railway bridges Midland Railway bridges The western of the two railway bridges was built in 1869, but the line it carried was truncated by the building of the Holmes Chord in the 1980s, and it is now unused. The eastern of the two bridges was built in 1840 as part of the North Midland Railway. This carried the \\"main line\\" from Derby to York until the diversion via Bradway and Sheffield was opened in 1870. The line is now freight-only. Lockhouse Bridge Just east of Ickles Lock, this is actually two bridges. The western bridge carries the continuation of Millmoor Lane and the eastern the ex-MS&L; freight-only line between Tinsley and Rotherham Central. Walkway under Centenary Way Centenary Way bridge (south) This carries the Centenary Way dual carriageway over the navigation, which has now been re-joined by the River Don. The road (A630) is an upgrading of the old Canklow Road and is the main access into Rotherham from the M1. It also forms part of the Rotherham Ring Road which was begun about 1968, actually only goes half way around town, was built in sections and completed in 1995. The towpath of the navigation (part of the Trans-Pennine Trail) is carried on a walkway that is cantilevered over the Don from the retaining wall of the factory site to the north. Corporation Bridge This single-span metal bridge carries Main Street over the navigation. Slightly upstream of this bridge was a wooden railway bridge with seven arches, built in 1838, that took the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway into Westgate Station. It was demolished in 1952. Prior to the re- routing of the canal in 1864, the Westgate line crossed the Holmes cut a little further to the west by a three-arched bridge, the centre arch of which was long and was made of iron. Rotherham Lock footbridge This footbridge provides pedestrian access to the Court House from Forge Island, which was once the site of an iron works but is now occupied by Tesco's. The River Don separates from the navigation above Forge Island, and there is a road and pedestrian bridge across the river into Forge Island. Chantry Chapel and Bridge Bridge Street Bridge (Chantry Bridge) and Rotherham Bridge Bridge Street Bridge (Chantry Bridge) is a single-span metal bridge that carries Bridge Street over the navigation. The street continues eastwards and originally crossed the river at Rotherham Bridge. As originally constructed in 1483 the bridge had four arches and was wide, but it was widened and a fifth arch added in 1768. In 1930 a new bridge was built nearby, a little further upstream, and as part of the work, the fifth arch was removed and the bridge was returned to its Medieval width. Because of improvements to the river made in the 18th and 19th centuries, it is wider than it used to be, and the bridge no longer reaches the west bank. The chapel on the bridge is one of only three complete bridge chapels that still exist in Britain, the other two being at Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and St Ives, Huntingdonshire. Dating from about 1483, it remained in use as a chapel until the reign of King Edward VI (1547–1553). It was put to use as almshouses during the 17th and 18th centuries, and in 1779 it was used as a prison. Later, it became a private dwelling and finally a tobacconist's shop, before being returned to its original use as a chapel; it was formally reconsecrated in 1924 by the Bishop of Sheffield. Centenary Way bridge (north) This carries the Centenary Way dual carriageway over the navigation. Greasbrough Road Bridge The Greasbrough Road is no longer a main road and only serves local businesses. Downstream of this bridge are 3 pipe bridges. Rawmarsh Road Bridge Called “Rotherham Rawmarsh Road Bridge 39” by British Waterways, this bridge carries the A633 Rotherham Road (from Rotherham to Parkgate). The A633 crossing of the River Don is called Grafton Bridge. Eastwood Footbridge Eastwood Footbridge This carries the public footpath from the Eastwood area of Rotherham to the Parkgate Retail Park. When the Rotherham Cut section of the Don Navigation was constructed in 1740, the crossing was by means of a swing bridge. This was replaced by the current footbridge in the late 1900s. To the south of Eastwood Footbridge is a bailey bridge crossing of the River Don. Wash Lane Bridge near Aldwarke Lock Wash Lane Bridge This bridge is situated immediately downstream of Aldwarke Weir and upstream of Aldwarke Lock. It was rebuilt in 1834. In more recent times, it has been superseded by the A6123 (Aldwarke Lane) road bridge spanning both river and navigation. The bridge is now gated at both ends to prevent access to pedestrians and traffic. Steelworks access (road) bridge This provides access to the two steelworks from the A630 road at Dalton. Don (rail) Bridge Thrybergh Bridge This forms part of the internal rail network of the two steelworks. It was constructed in 1901 as part of what was called locally John Brown's Private Railway. This railway connected the Silverwood and Roundwood Collieries of John Brown & Company with wharves on the Don Navigation. The girder bridge crossing the Don Navigation was the main engineering work on this railway line. It was built by Newton, Chambers & Company. Thrybergh (rail) Bridge This carried the former Great Central and Midland Railways' joint line across the River Don. This line was double track. It was essentially a colliery line and never carried a regular passenger service. Kilnhurst and Mexborough area Kilnhurst Station Road Bridge This is bridge number 46 and conveys the road to Hooton Roberts. The bridge over the Navigation adjoins the bridge over the railway. The bridge over railway is original, but that over the Navigation is a modern replacement. The \\"Station\\" in the name Station Road refers to the Kilnhurst Central (Great Central) Station rather than the Kilnhurst West (Midland Railway) Station. Kilnhurst Burton Ings Bridge Kilnhurst Burton Ings Bridge This is bridge number 47 and conveys a service road over the Navigation and railway. At this point on the west side of the Navigation, there was a large tar distillation works and it is probable that this road connected that works with a tip or further chemical plant on the east side. The tar distillation works was built by Ellison & Mitchell in 1886 and became part of the Yorkshire Tar Distillers group in 1927. Swinton Talbot Road Bridge This is bridge number 48 and connects the main road in Swinton (A6022 Bridge Street and Rowms Lane) with an industrial estate whose principal unit is the Morphy Richards distribution centre. Mexborough Station Road Bridge Mexborough Double Bridges This is named \\"Double Bridges and Footbridge 49A\\" by the Canal & River Trust. The bridge carries a footway and double-track railway over the Navigation. This section of the Navigation must have represented quite a challenge for full- size barges to negotiate since the bridges are immediately adjacent to a right-angle bend in the canal. Mexborough Station Road Bridge This is bridge number 52 and carries the access road to Mexborough railway station from the A6023 Greens Way (and the town centre). Mexborough BBCS Flour Mill Mexborough BBCS Flour Mill This imposing building (and associated wharf) stands on the north side of the Navigation close to the Church of St John the Baptist. It started off as the \\"Don Roller Mills\\". It was owned by James White who sold it to the Barnsley British Cooperative Society in 1912. Conisbrough and Warmsworth area Conisbrough Earth Centre Bridge Conisbrough Earth Centre Bridge This is named \\"Cadeby Colliery Bridge 57\\" by the Canal & River Trust because it once provided a road access to Cadeby Colliery from the south. From 1999 to 2004, the bridge provided the main access to the ill-fated Earth Centre visitor attraction. The bridge now forms part of public access from Conisbrough Station to the main (west-east) section of the Trans Pennine Trail. There are two pipe bridges just upstream of the road bridge. Conisbrough Viaduct Conisbrough Viaduct Conisbrough Viaduct was built in the first decade of the 20th century as part of the Dearne Valley Railway. This was a line which essentially served a coalfield, although there was a rudimentary passenger service between 1912 and 1951. The remaining coal traffic on the line ceased in 1966. The viaduct has 21 arches and was built from 12 million Conisbrough blue bricks. The central metal span is long and crosses the Don at a height of . The viaduct remained out of use until 2001, when ownership was transferred to Railway Paths Ltd, who manage potentially useful railway structures until they can be incorporated into the National Cycle Network. Installation of a new deck surface and safety railings were funded by the Railway Heritage Trust in early 2008, and the viaduct re-opened as part of the Sustrans network in April 2008. Rainbow Bridge Built in 1849 as part of the South Yorkshire Railway, which later became part of the Great Central Railway, the Rainbow bridge is still in use and carries the Swinton to Doncaster railway line. Sprotbrough Bridge (southern) Sprotbrough Bridge Sprotbrough Bridge is actually two bridges that carry Mill Lane, the southern one crossing the weir stream and the northern one crossing the lock cut. Replacing a ferry crossing of the river, the first bridge and associated toll house were built in 1849 for Sir Joseph William Copley of Sprotbrough Hall. The designers of the southern bridge were Benjamin Brundell and William Arnold, and the present structure has three segmental arches on each side, which originally formed the approaches to a central arch. The arch was replaced by an above-deck truss in 1897. The ironwork was manufactured by Newton Chambers & Co. Ltd., who were based at Thorncliffe Ironworks in Sheffield, as recorded by plates attached to the bridge. The northern bridge was a single-arched masonry structure, which has been replaced by a plate girder bridge resting on the original piers. The toll house, consisting of a single storey with a half basement, made of dressed sandstone with an asphalt roof, still survives on the northern bank of the lock cut. Tolls collected here for passage over Sprotbrough Bridge were said to have been given by the Copley family to the Doncaster Dispensary. A1 Don Viaduct This bridge carries the A1(M) motorway over the river; it was opened by Ernest Marples, the Minister of Transport, on 31 July 1961. It consists of two separate structures, one for each carriageway, each having seven spans. The longest span, formed from two cantilevers and a suspended central span of , carries the motorway over the river at a height of . The total length of the structure is , and it has a slight horizontal and vertical curve at its southern end. Five riveted steel girders and a composite concrete deck support each carriageway. The bridge was one of the first to use rubber bearings, and the first to use bitumen membranes lined with copper to make the decks waterproof. The design includes jacking points to compensate for mining subsidence. The two viaducts at Warmsworth Warmsworth railway viaducts There are two railway viaducts at Warmsworth. The western one was completed in 1914 and formed part of the Hull & Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway. This was essentially a railway to serve the coalfield and was closed in 1958. For some years after closure, the viaduct was used to carry a conveyor belt over the Don. It became part of the Doncaster spur on the Trans-Pennine Trail, which was officially opened in 2001. The steel pillars supporting the viaduct are filled with limestone. Its construction, which uses an above-deck truss, contrasts with the below-deck truss of the eastern viaduct, which was completed in 1910 and formed part of the Great Central Railway. It still carries a freight-only line that avoids a crossing on the level of the East Coast Main Line at Doncaster Station. Doncaster Town area Newtons Farm footbridge, with debris from the flooding in June 2007 to the left of the wooden part of the bridge. Newtons Farm Footbridge Two bridges situated side-by side, one made of concrete and the other a wooden bridge, cross one of the two weir channels where the river leaves the navigation before Doncaster Town Lock. Cheswold Hauling Bridge Cheswold Hauling Bridge, also known as Cheswold High Bridge, is a footbridge on the navigation towpath, which crosses the second of the two weir streams where the river leaves the navigation upstream of Doncaster Town Lock. The small section of river between the footbridge and where it rejoins that part of the River Don that left the navigation at Newtons Farm footbridge is called the River Cheswold, reputedly the shortest river in Great Britain. Doncaster Railway Bridges, showing North Bridge to the right North Bridge and St Marys Bridge North Bridge Road is carried over the railway and then the navigation at Doncaster Town Lock by North Bridge, and over the Don by St Mary's Bridge. North Bridge Road was previously part of the Great North Road. Until 1910, this crossed the railway on the level before crossing the Don Navigation. After 1910, a lengthy iron bridge took the road over the railway, navigation and river. This bridge was replaced by the current North Bridge in 2003. Its use was restricted to buses, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians from the time the new St George's Bridge opened, until 2015, when all northbound traffic was allowed to use the bridge again to help with congestion problems on St George's Bridge. South bound traffic still carries the same traffic restrictions. The new bridge was constructed over the top of the old one while it was still in situ. Once the old bridge had been stripped of its surface trimmings the deck was cut up into 25-tonne sections, which were suspended from the new structure. A pulley system was used to transport these sections along the underside of the new bridge, so that they could be lowered onto the towpath, where they were cut up further before removal from the site. Railway bridges Below the North Bridge, the six railway tracks north of Doncaster Station cross the Don Navigation on three separate bridges. This section of tracks is known as Marshgate Junction and is where the lines to Leeds, York and Thorne diverge. Friars Gate Bridge This bridge provides access across the navigation from the centre of Doncaster to the small businesses and car parks on the \\"island\\" between the river and navigation. St George's Bridge, the Hub and the Waterside Area St George's Bridge St George's Bridge is one of the newest bridges over the Don. It carries the dual carriageway New Bridge Road, part of the A19, which is now the main road north out of Doncaster. It was opened on 22 November 2001, and was named St George's Bridge as a result of a public competition. It consists of a long steel-composite bridge with spans of over the River Don, the East Coast Main Line, and the Don Navigation. The ladder beam layout, using two main plate girders, cross-girders at centres and precast planks, was chosen both to optimise the deck and to minimise the size and number of the piers. Chappell Drive Bridge This bridge provides access across the navigation from the centre of Doncaster to the small businesses situated on the \\"island\\" between the river and navigation. It is situated immediately north of the Hub campus of Doncaster College. Going downstream, there is a gap of some before the next public road crossing of the navigation at Barnby Dun. Barnby Dun area Kirk Sandall Railway Bridge Kirk Sandall Railway Bridge This bridge conveys the (ex-Great Central Railway) Doncaster-to- Hull railway over the Navigation. The bridge consists of two single-span decks, both with above deck trusses. The older south deck (pictured here) is no longer used. The north deck accommodates both tracks of what is now a double-track railway. The quadruple track from Thorne Junction on this line now finishes at Kirk Sandall Junction, a few hundred metres to the east. A further bridge to the west conveys the railway over the River Don. Kirk Sandall Pipe Bridge Kirk Sandall Pipe Bridge At this point, the Navigation runs parallel to, and a few metres to the south-east of, the River Don. A pipe bridge high above both the Navigation and the River once carry waste from the glass works which adjoined the towpath (to the south-east) across to a series of settling ponds (to the north-west). The glass works was a major employer in the Kirk Sandall area. The St Helens-based Pilkington Bros established a plate glass works here in the early 1920s. The site was chosen for its proximity to the canal and railway, and for the sandy terrain which was needed for the production of glass. Pilkingtons also funded the building of 400 new houses in the Brecks Lane area, together with associated school and recreational facilities. The glass works closed in the 1990s and its site is now occupied by various units on an industrial estate. Barnby Dun Lift Bridge Barnby Dun Lift Bridge This was built in 1983 to replace the original (1900) swing bridge. It is built of steel and powered by electricity. The replacement work cost £0.5M and was part of a wider upgrade of the Navigation to conform to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard (see Later Development section of this article). An elevated control house was built for the sole use of operational staff, but in recent years a freestanding low level standard control console has been built for the use of boaters when the bridge is not staffed. Sykehouse Lift Bridge (downstream of Barnby Dun) was built to the same technical specification. Although the bridge carries an unclassified road linking Barnby Dun and Bentley, the bridge also provided the only access for heavy loads to the nearby Thorpe Marsh power station, so the bridge was designed to carry abnormal loads of up to 180 tons gross weight. Although Thorpe Marsh Power Station has now been demolished, the bridge is still busy with road traffic. This is because it is one of the few crossings of the Navigation in this area.

Stone was born in Taunton, Somerset. After the death of his father, he went to live with his uncle, William Hurford, who was a coal merchant, in London. Together with his younger brother, William, he took over his uncle's business upon his death. Stone became friends with Joseph Priestley as a member of Richard Price's church in Hackney; these associations also radicalized him. He was a member of the London Revolution Society and in February 1792 he offered to help Talleyrand secure British neutrality in the European wars involving France. He and his wife moved to Paris in April to open a sal ammoniac factory and established himself as part of the British expatriate community, including Helen Maria Williams with whom he had a subsequent long love affair. Stone, while saddened by the September Massacres, believed they were necessary for the revolutionary to succeed and he and other expatriates celebrated French military victories. In addition to his factory, Stone established a printing house, Imprimerie Anglaise, which printed Joel Barlow's epic, The Vision of Columbus. Like many other Britons living in France at the time, Stone and his wife were arrested after the decree of 9 October 1793, but they were released on 30 October. During the reign of terror, Stone paid 12,000 francs to help Stéphanie de Genlis's husband escape from prison, but she later refused to pay this debt back. In April 1794 Stone was denounced as agent of William Pitt and he and his wife were arrested again, but let go on the condition that they leave the country. They fled to Switzerland, where Helen Maria Williams was staying. In June, he was allowed back into France to obtain a divorce. Throughout these troubled years, Stone continued to write openly to his brother William, who was tried for treason (unsuccessfully) in January 1796 on the basis of the letters. Their contents made a return to Britain impossible for Stone. After the terror, Stone and Williams returned to Paris together. In 1798, William Cobbett published letters Stone had written to Priestley, forcing Priestley to denounce his friend's statements. Stone's printing business published works by Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, and Constantin Volney, among other. He was bankrupted in 1812 by the high cost of printing the 30-volume Voyage de Humboldt et de Bonpland. Stone died in 1818 and was buried in Paris' Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Hummel was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York in 2007 when he was honored with the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for baseball writing. Known throughout baseball by his nickname \\"The Commish\\", he is a former President of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Early life Richard Lowell Hummel is a native of Quincy, Illinois, graduating from Quincy Senior High School in 1964. At first Hummel remained in his hometown for higher education, attending Quincy University before transferring to the University of Missouri to attend their renowned School of Journalism. Rick Hummel expressed an interest in sports journalism and broadcasting at an early age, having auditioned for a job at Quincy station WGEM (AM) when he was twelve years old. Hummel did not get the announcing job, but later in high school he worked as a spotter for former MLB player and coach Elvin Tappe and his twin brother Melvin as they broadcast Quincy High School games. It was Melvin Tappe who also encouraged Hummel to pursue a career as a sports writer. While attending the University of Missouri Hummel returned home during two summers to work for the Quincy Herald-Whig. At Mizzou, he worked on the Sports Information department's statistics crew for football games alongside another future sports notable, John Walsh, now executive vice president and executive editor of ESPN. Professional career Following graduation from the University of Missouri in 1968 Rick Hummel served three years in the U.S. Army. While stationed in Colorado he also worked as a part-time employee for two years on the Colorado Springs Free Press-Sun After his discharge from the Army in 1971, Hummel was hired by fellow Mizzou alum Bob Broeg to work for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Broeg, who himself would earn the Sprink award and be inducted into Cooperstown in 1979, at first assigned Hummel to cover secondary and St. Louis regional teams for the newspaper. Hummel \\"made his bones\\" as a beat writer for the St. Louis Stars professional soccer team, the American Basketball Association's Spirits of St. Louis, and St. Louis University hockey, among others. An avid amateur athlete in his younger years, Hummel earned his nickname \\"The Commish\\" or \\"The Commissioner\\" for his exhaustive knowledge of the rules involved in the softball football, and bowling leagues he and Post-Dispatch teammates participated in. The first of Rick Hummel's big breaks at the Post-Dispatch came in 1973 when he covered around eight St. Louis Cardinals home games for the newspaper, his first being a 1-0 rain- shortened victory over the Montreal Expos. Another milestone came in 1978 when long-time Cardinals beat writer Neal Russo was unable to make a trip to Cincinnati, Ohio. Hummel was sent in his place and ended up covering a historic game as Hall of Famer Tom Seaver pitched his only career no-hitter in a 4-0 victory for the Reds. Hummel continued to work as the game-day beat reporter until 2002 when he transitioned to the primary role of weekly baseball columnist, while still covering the occasional Cardinals game. In activities away from the Post-Dispatch, in 1994 his peers elected Hummel President of the Baseball Writers Association of America. He has also served on the Baseball Hall of Fame Overview Committee, reviewing the careers of potential inductees by the Veterans Committee. In addition to his print media career Rick Hummel is often called upon for his baseball expertise and opinions by St. Louis radio and television stations as well as being a frequent on-camera contributor to Fox Sports Midwest's St. Louis Cardinals pre-game and post-game broadcasts. His commentary has also been featured on various ESPN shows and documentaries. Personal Rick Hummel's ex-wife Connie Karr, the mother of his daughter Lauren, was one of five people murdered during the Kirkwood City Council shooting in February 2008.

According to the 2001 Iran census, there were roughly 203,000 Iraqis living in Iran; a UNHCR report counts 204,000 Iraqis living in Iran.UNHCR record 204,00 0 Iraqis in Iran The actual figure is likely to be much higher than this, perhaps exceeding 500,000, as many Iraqis gained Iranian citizenship while in Iran. In recent years, many have returned to Iraq following the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime. Migration history Iraqis have always been a thriving community in Iran, with well established populations in Ahvaz, Abadan and Ilam, but many have fled and settled in other countries because of events such as the 1979 Islamic Iranian revolution and the Iran–Iraq War. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recorded over 202,000 Iraqi refugees in Iran in September 2003, over half the entire Iraqi refugee population in the world. About 50,000 of them are housed in 22 refugee camps in Iran, which are situated along the country's western border with Iraq, this number is significantly higher than that for Afghan refugees, of whom only about 2 percent live in camps. The majority of Iraqi refugees live in urban areas in western Iran. In total, more than 11,500 Iraqis have returned in convoys facilitated by UNHCR from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon since the end of the war that led to the downfall of Saddam Hussein. With more than 200,000 Iraqi refugees living in Iran, they are more than half of all registered Iraqi refugees in the world. At around 48,000 of the refugees are hosted in Iran's camps, but most Iraqi refugees live in large urban centres, usually in the western parts of Iran. The majority of Iraqis have opted for life in Tehran, due to its high standards of living and greater job availability.UNHCR - Feature: In Iran, urban refugees debate return to post-Saddam Iraq Predominantly settling down in Doulatabad, an almost entirely Iraqi neighbourhood in the south-eastern corner of Tehran. Another well known Iraqi neighbourhood in Iran is Marvi Alley, a shopping area located in the centre of Tehran. This is where the first Iraqi refugees came in the early '70s, and has remained a centre for all Iraqis in Tehran, often dubbed it Baghdad Market.

The genre cannot be rigidly defined, and in any case feste teatrali tend to be split into two different sets: feste teatrali divided by acts are operas, while works in this genre performed without division, or merely cut into two parts, are serenatas. A festa teatrale is a dramatic work, performed on stage (unlike many serenatas, which are labelled \\"drammatico\\" but were not performed in dramatic contexts). The festa teatrale was always a fairly minor genre, born of courtly entertainments and the celebration of royalty — hence the abbreviated length of most festi teatrale, and the focus on drama, spectacle and chorus, as opposed to elaborate music. The poet and librettist Metastasio applied the term to 9 of his libretti. All but one of these were first performed for the court at Vienna. The last of these was Johann Adolph Hasse's Partenope, performed during 1767. Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, the first of his \\"reform operas\\" (also first seen at Vienna), is also often considered part of the genre of festa teatrale. Handel's Parnasso in Festa, presented in London in 1734 as part of the celebrations for the wedding of Anne, Princess Royal, is another example of the genre. The genre does not seem to have survived after Metastasio, though it had been in existence for over a century — Francesco Cavalli wrote feste teatrali, among many other early composers.

The ship was named for the German statesman Otto von Bismarck. The design for Fürst Bismarck was an improvement over the previous protected cruiser—Fürst Bismarck was significantly larger and better armed than her predecessors. The ship was primarily intended for colonial duties, and she served in this capacity as part of the East Asia Squadron until she was relieved in 1909, at which point she returned to Germany. The ship was rebuilt between 1910 and 1914, and after the start of World War I, she was briefly used as a coastal defense ship. She proved inadequate to this task, and so she was withdrawn from active duty and served as a training ship for engineers until the end of the war. Fürst Bismarck was decommissioned in 1919 and sold for scrap.  Design  Fürst Bismarck was designed before the naval arms race between Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann was the State Secretary of the Naval Office at the time. Given the dominance of the British Royal Navy and the impossibility, as he saw it, of competing with it, Hollmann envisaged a small fleet consisting of torpedo boats and coastal defense ships to be based in German waters. This would be supplemented by a number of cruisers for overseas duties, including trade protection. The first armored cruiser to be designed by the German navy, Fürst Bismarck was an enlarged version of the s, at nearly twice the displacement and with a significantly more powerful armament. The ship was intended for overseas use, particularly in support of German colonies in Asia and the Pacific. Despite heavy political opposition, the new ship was approved by the Reichstag and construction began in 1896.  General characteristics and machinery Line drawing of Fürst Bismarck Fürst Bismarck was at the waterline, with an overall length of and a beam of . She had a draft of forward and aft. She displaced as designed and at full load Fürst Bismarck was a very good sea-boat, and was highly responsive to commands from the helm. However, the ship suffered from serious roll problems and heavy vibration at higher speeds. Her metacentric height was . The ship was of transverse and longitudinal steel frame construction; the hull was a single layer of wooden planks covered by a Muntz metal sheath that extended up to above the waterline. The lower portions of the ship, including the stem and the stern, were covered with bronze plating. The ship had 13 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 59 percent of the length of the hull. Fürst Bismarck was propelled by three vertical four- cylinder, triple-expansion engines. The engines were powered by four Thornycroft boilers—which had been built under license by Germaniawerft—and 8 cylindrical boilers. The Thornycroft boilers had two fire boxes apiece, for a total of eight, while the cylindrical boilers each had four fire boxes, for a total of 32. Each of the three engines drove a three-bladed screw propeller. The center propeller was in diameter, while the two outer screws were slightly larger, at in diameter. The engines produced and a top speed of . On trials, the engines were pushed to , but still only provided a top speed of . Electrical power was supplied by five generators that provided 325 kilowatts at 110 volts.  Armament  Fritz Stoltenberg painting of Fürst Bismarck shortly after her commissioning Fürst Bismarcks primary armament consisted of a battery of four 24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns in twin-gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. The guns were mounted in Drh.L. C/98 turrets, which allowed elevation to 30° and depression to −5°. At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to . The guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of . The ship stored 312 rounds, for a total of 78 shells per gun. The secondary armament consisted of twelve SK L/40 quick-firing guns in MPL type casemates. These guns fired armor-piercing shells at a rate of 4 to 5 per minute. The ships carried 120 shells per gun, for a total of 2,160 rounds total. The guns could depress to −7 degrees and elevate to 20 degrees, for a maximum range of 13,700 m (14,990 yd). The shells weighed and were fired at a muzzle velocity of . The guns were manually elevated and trained. For defense against torpedo boats, the ship also carried ten SK L/30 guns in a combination of individual casemates and pivot mounts. These guns fired shell at a muzzle velocity of . Their rate of fire was approximately 15 shells per minute; the guns could engage targets out to . The gun mounts were manually operated. Six torpedo tubes were also fitted, with a total of 16 torpedoes. One tube was fitted to a swivel mount on the stern of the ship, four were submerged on the broadside, and the sixth was placed in the bow, also submerged.  Armor  Fürst Bismarck was protected with Krupp armor, which was in some cases thicker than that of subsequent designs. The armor belt was thick in the central portion of the ship, and tapered down to towards either end of the ship. Set behind the armored belt were thick shields for critical areas of the ship. The main armored deck was thick, with thick slopes. The forward conning tower had 20 cm-thick sides and a thick roof, while the aft conning tower had 10 cm sides and a 3 cm roof. The main battery turret sides were 20 cm thick and the roofs were 4 cm thick. The 15 cm turrets had 10 cm sides and gun shields. The casemated guns had 10 cm shields. By contrast, the following armored cruiser design, , had only had a 10 cm-thick armor belt and of armor on the turret sides. Even , Germany's last armored cruiser, only had a armored belt and 18 cm-thick turret faces, though her overall scale of protection was much more comprehensive than Fürst Bismarcks.  Service history  Fürst Bismarck at her launching ceremony The contract for Fürst Bismarck was awarded to the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel, and her keel was laid down on 1 April 1896. Her completed hull was launched on 25 September 1897, where she was christened after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. While the shipyard was completing the fitting-out work for the new armored cruiser on 2 March 1900, the ironclad accidentally collided with Fürst Bismarck, slightly damaging her stern. The accident delayed the start of sea trials until 19 March. Initial testing revealed the need for alterations to the ship, but the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in China in late 1899 prevented the work from being done, as the German East Asia Squadron required reinforcement. Accordingly, on 30 June the ship left Kiel for East Asia, stopping to refuel at Gibraltar and at Port Said and Port Tewfik, at both ends of the Suez Canal. While passing through the Red Sea, 41 members of her crew suffered from heat-related illness. Fürst Bismarck stopped in Perim at the southern end of the Red Sea and then crossed the Indian Ocean to Colombo, Ceylon before proceeding to Singapore. East Asia Squadron Boxer Rebellion Illustration of Fürst Bismarck In Singapore on 4 August, the ship received orders to escort the troop ships Frankfurt and Wittekind to Tsingtao, the capital of the German Kiautschou Bay concession in China. The three ships arrived there on 13 August, and four days later, Vizeadmiral (VAdm—Vice Admiral) Emil Felix von Bendemann, the commander of the East Asia Squadron, transferred his flag from the protected cruiser to Fürst Bismarck. At the time, in addition to Hertha, the squadron consisted of the protected cruisers , , and and the unprotected cruisers and , the latter having arrived in the region just days before Fürst Bismarck. Not long after Fürst Bismarck reached Hong Kong, the Detached Division, which consisted of the four pre-dreadnought battleships of the and the aviso arrived with additional troop ships. The squadron was further reinforced over the following month with the cruisers , , and , the gunboats and , the torpedo boats , , and , and the hospital ship Gera. German forces contributed 24 warships and 17,000 soldiers to the Eight Nation Alliance, which assembled 250 warships and 70,000 soldiers in total to combat the Boxers. An agreement with Russia saw the German Generalfeldmarshall (Field Marshal) Alfred von Waldersee placed in command of the multinational force. Bendemann decided to implement a blockade of the Yangtze, and so went there with Fürst Bismarck, Gefion, Irene, and the gunboat , as well as the ships of the Detached Division, though he sent the battleship to cover the landing of troops at Taku. Landing parties from the ships went ashore in Shanghai to protect Europeans there. Bendemann sent Seeadler and Schwalbe up the Yangtze to protect German, Austro-Hungarian, and Belgian nationals upriver, Bussard to Amoy, and Luchs and S91 to Canton. Bendemann based his flagship in Shanghai, and on 25 September, Hertha arrived with the new German ambassador to China, Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein to meet with Bendemann before proceeding on to Peking. By this time, Allied forces had seized Peitsang at the mouth of the Peiho river, but the port frequently froze over in the winter, so additional harbors were necessary to adequately supply the forces fighting ashore. Bendemann therefore took most of his fleet to attack the ports of Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, since they had rail connections to Taku and Peking. Bendemann issued an ultimatum to surrender to the Chinese defenders of the cities, both of which accepted, allowing the Alliance to take both cities without a fight. On 5 October, Fürst Bismarck steamed to Taku, where she joined Hertha and Hela and the battleships and . Beginning in late October, the naval forces of the Eight Nation Alliance concentrated on the mouth of the Yangtze. Britain and Germany both suspected the other of attempting to secure a permanent occupation of the area, though both suspicions proved to be false. In November, Fürst Bismarck went to Nagasaki, Japan for engine maintenance, temporarily transferring Bendemann to Kaiserin Augusta while she was away for repairs. By February 1901, the fighting had decreased to the point that the ships of the East Asia Squadron could resume the normal routine of individual and squadron training exercises. In May, Seeadler was detached to Yap in the Caroline Islands, and in June, Hansa carried Konteradmiral (KAdm—Rear Admiral) Hermann Kirchhoff to Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. Also in June, the Detached Division, Irene, and Gefion returned to Germany. The following month, the East Asia Squadron returned to its normal peacetime footing. Fürst Bismarck visited Japanese ports with Geier, S91, and S92 in mid-1901, and in September, she and S91 visited Port Arthur in Russian Manchuria before returning to Japanese waters in October. Another shipyard period in Nagasaki followed, which included repairs to her frequently-leaky stern. By this time, the Chinese government had signed the Boxer Protocol on 7 September, formally ending the conflict. The experience of projecting significant military power over such a great distance proved to be invaluable to the German army and navy and it made particularly clear the importance of logistics. Accordingly, a maritime transport department was created in the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) in 1902 under Carl Derzewski. 1902–1905 Fürst Bismarck in port at some point during her career Fürst Bismarck completed repairs in Nagasaki on 15 January 1902 and in early February she rendezvoused with Hertha and Bussard in Singapore. There, Bendemann returned to the ship, though days later on 15 February, he turned command of the squadron over to VAdm Richard Geissler. Later that month, the light cruiser joined the squadron; further changes to the composition of the squadron followed shortly thereafter, with Kaiserin Augusta, S91, and S92 returning to Germany in February and March. In April, Schwalbe, Geier, and Luchs went to Ning Po to protect Europeans from unrest in the city while Fürst Bismarck and the rest of the squadron toured East Asian ports, ranging from Japan to the Dutch East Indies. During this period, they also conducted various training exercises and alternated visits to Tsingtao and Japan for periodic maintenance. Schwalbe returned to Germany in September, though her place was taken by Geier. On 25 December, Kaiser Wilhelm II awarded the Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the East Asia Squadron to Fürst Bismarck. In early 1903, Fürst Bismarck anchored off the mouth of the Yangtze with Hansa and Thetis, remaining there until mid-March before proceeding to Tsingtao. She remained there until late April, when the squadron conducted training exercises through May, during which Fürst Bismarck again won the Schießpreis. The ship visited Japan in company with Bussard, where Geissler and his staff were received by Emperor Meiji. The two ships then made a visit to the Russian Pacific Fleet, based in Vladivostok, in early August. On 15 November, KAdm Curt von Prittwitz und Gaffron replaced Geissler as the squadron commander, after which Fürst Bismarck returned to Nagasaki for another overhaul in December. The year 1904 began with exercises and visits to ports in the region. By this time, tensions between Russia and Japan over their competing interests in Korea had risen considerably, so on 7 January the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) instructed Prittwitz und Gaffron to order his ships to observe the strictest neutrality toward both countries. Over the course of 20–23 January, Hansa evacuated German and Austro-Hungarian citizens from Port Arthur and Dalny. Japan severed diplomatic relations with Russia on 5 February and attacked the Russian fleet in Port Arthur in a surprise nighttime attack on 8/9 February without having declared war. On 12 February, Hansa returned to Port Arthur to remove the last of the civilians from the city, and Thetis was sent to Chemulpo to do the same on 21–22 February. After the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, several damaged Russian ships sought refuge in Tsingtao, including the battleship and the cruiser , where they were interned for the remainder of the Russo-Japanese War. For the rest of the war, Fürst Bismarck and the East Asia Squadron were primarily occupied with enforcing the internment of the ship and destroying Russian naval mines that threatened German shipping. During the war, the squadron continued its normal training routine, and Fürst Bismarck won the Schießpreis again that year. She, Hertha, and Seeadler were present in Shanghai for the opening of a German club in the city. In early 1905, riots in China forced most of the squadron to remain in Chinese ports until March. Prittwitz und Gaffron recalled his ships to Tsingtao when the Russian Second Pacific Squadron approached the area; following the Battle of Tsushima, where the Russian squadron was annihilated, the German vessels resumed training activities. Later in the year, both Seeadler and Thetis were sent to German East Africa to suppress a rebellion against German rule. By August, a floating dry dock had been completed in Tsingtao, allowing the East Asia Squadron to repair its ships itself; Fürst Bismarck underwent repairs there in October. On 11 November, KAdm Alfred Breusing relieved Prittwitz und Gaffron as commander of the squadron, and in December embarked on a tour of the southern portion of the East Asia Station, though the cruise had to be cut short due to unrest in Shanghai that necessitated Fürst Bismarcks presence there. The ship sent a landing party ashore, along with men from the gunboats , Tiger, and . The men patrolled the city center and protected the German consulate, but did not take any active role in the unrest. 1906–1908 In January 1906, Fürst Bismarck began a tour of Indonesia, after which she went to Hong Kong in late February. She remained there for almost a month, departing on 23 March to meet the rest of the squadron, which by then could be withdrawn from Shanghai. Fürst Bismarck and Hansa, the only major warships assigned to the squadron by that time, visited Japanese ports in May. On 28 May, Fürst Bismarck went to Taku, where Breusing and his staff traveled overland to Peking, the first German naval officers to visit the Guangxu Emperor and Empress Dowager Cixi after the Boxer Rebellion. Hansa began the voyage back to Germany on 4 July, and on 9 August, the light cruiser arrived to join the squadron. On 19 November, the light cruiser arrived to further strengthen the squadron. Fürst Bismarck and Tiger went on another tour of Indonesia and Japan in early 1907. On 13 May, KAdm Carl von Coerper arrived to replace Breusing; he began his tenure as squadron commander by boarding Tiger for a cruise into the Yangtze to familiarize himself with German economic interests in the area. After returning to Fürst Bismarck, he visited Japan in company with Niobe. During the squadron maneuvers that year, Fürst Bismarck won the Schießpreis for a fourth time. The light cruiser joined the squadron on 23 October, finally bringing the strength of the unit back to its prescribed four cruisers. In January 1908, Fürst Bismarck steamed to Siam, where she was visited by the King of Siam. The rest of the year passed uneventfully for Fürst Bismarck, and in early 1909 she received orders to return to Germany for repairs. The scale of work necessary for the ship, which had been abroad for nine years, was greater than could be done in the floating dock in Tsingtao and it would have been too expensive to do elsewhere in Asia. On 8 April, she began the voyage home and she rendezvoused with the new flagship of the East Asia Squadron, the armored cruiser , in Colombo on 29 April. Fürst Bismarck arrived in Kiel on 13 June, where she was decommissioned on 26 June. Later career In 1910, Fürst Bismarck was taken into the shipyard at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel for an extensive modernization. Part of the work also included converting the ship into a torpedo training ship to replace the old ironclad . Her heavy fighting masts were replaced with lighter pole masts and her two aft-most 15 cm turrets were removed. The work lasted for four years, and was completed shortly after the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. On 28 November, Fürst Bismarck was recommissioned under the command of Kapitän zur See KzS—Captain at Sea) Ferdinand Bertram, the former head of the artillery school. She initially completed sea trials, but owing to her low combat value was not assigned to a front-line unit. Instead, she was allocated to I Marine Inspectorate based in Kiel for use as a training ship. From 4 to 6 September 1916, she was disarmed, and from 1917 she was also used to train commanders for the Type U-151 cruiser submarines and the navy's zeppelins. She was decommissioned on 31 December 1918 after the end of the war, though she remained in the fleet's inventory into mid-1919. She served as a floating office until 27 May before being stricken from the naval register on 17 June. She was then transferred to what was now the Reichswerft in Kiel and then sold to a Dortmund-based company and broken up in 1919–1920 in Rendsburg-Audorf.

The film stars Ramon Novarro, Dorothy Jordan, and Renée Adorée. It featured several songs performed by Novarro and originally included a sequence photographed in Technicolor. Plot In Seville, Spain, a cantina is located across the street from San Agustín convent. At the convent, postulant Maria Consuelo Vargas (Dorothy Jordan) receives a visit from her brother, Captain Enrique Vargas (Russell Hopton). They have not seen each other in seven years, as he has been stationed in Africa. During the intervening time, their mother has died, which left Maria alone in the world, until she entered the convent. Enrique is thrilled that she will soon be married to God. Maria is enthralled by the music that comes from across the street – implying that she wants to explore life outside the convent - but Enrique prefers that she remain behind the safety of the convent walls, as he considers the outside world evil. After Enrique leaves, Maria peers over the convent walls to watch Juan de Dios (Ramon Novarro) perform at the cantina. Later in the set, Juan sings and dances with his partner, Lola (Renée Adorée). After the set, Juan flirts with some female customers, which irks Lola. Juan walks Lola home, during which time he treats her badly, knowing that she is in love with him, and thus will tolerate the abuse. At home, Juan meets with his music teacher, Esteban (Ernest Torrence). Esteban believes Juan has the makings of a great singer like he himself once was. Esteban squandered away his fame and fortune by reckless behavior – the same reckless behavior Juan now exhibits – which he is trying to steer Juan away from. If his old contacts will listen, Esteban plans to take Juan to Madrid so that he can truly become a great serious singer under the management of one of the great impresarios. After a day outing at the market where he steals some oranges and some cloth and thus is trying to escape from the police, Juan runs into Maria in a private courtyard, she who he has never met. She has escaped from the convent and is stealing a dress from a clothes line to replace her convent garb. She leaves a token for the dress. She recognizes him. As she tells him she has no home, he, who is immediately attracted to her, takes her home with him. Maria eventually tells Juan that she has escaped from the convent to find “him”, as she has always been drawn to the magic that is his singing. Then, Lola shows up. Juan is able to make her go away without knowing that Maria is there. Esteban believes Maria to be nothing more than a street harlot, but Juan is able to convince him that she is a child of God. Juan then tells Esteban that they will indeed go to Madrid, and bring Maria along as their housekeeper. At the convent, Enrique is trying to find Maria. The Mother Superior (Nance O'Neil) tells him that as Maria had not yet taken her vows, she was free to leave. Maria being drawn to music may provide a clue as to her whereabouts. Then, Lola arrives – she has found a convent garment in Juan's room, the garment which Enrique and the Mother Superior recognize as Maria's. Enrique vows to travel to Madrid to kill Juan. In Madrid, Juan, Esteban and Maria rent a three-bedroom flat that is managed by a music aficionado, La Rumbarita (Mathilde Comont). A once great singer used to reside there, which they all believe is karma. Later at the audition with impresario Mischa, Juan displays his arrogant attitude about what he sees as the greatness of his singing. Although the audition is technically sound, Mischa tells Juan that he has no soul in his singing, and that he needs to have his heart broken to achieve true greatness. As such, Mischa, will not accept him as a client. After Juan storms out in disgust, Esteban negotiates payment – all the money that he has - to Mischa to take Juan on as a client in lower level musical events, Juan not to know the financial arrangement. Mischa happily agrees, seeing this arrangement as a windfall. Back at the flat, Juan, angry about Mischa's assessment, takes it out on Maria by berating her. But seeing how loyal she is to him, Juan changes his tune and declares his undying love for her. They embrace. Later, he visits a priest to make arrangements for their marriage. As Juan tells Esteban and La Rumbarita of the wedding, they go off to buy items for an engagement celebration party, but not before Esteban is able to tell Juan that Mischa has arranged for him to sing Pagliacci that evening. Juan is excited, but believes that Mischa has just come to his senses, not knowing about Esteban and Mischa's financial arrangement. While Juan is alone at the flat, Enrique tracks Juan down, ready to kill him. Although they initially argue about the situation with Maria, Enrique, with a little help from Lola, is able to convince Juan to send Maria back to the convent, as his act of love is stealing her away from her vow to God, and that she would always be seen as harlot if they were to get married, thus sending her to eternal damnation. Knowing that Maria will not go willingly, Juan convinces Maria that he no longer loves her as he has reconciled with Lola. A tearful Maria, now believing the outside world is evil as Enrique once said, leaves with her brother back to Seville and San Agustín. Despite Juan's broken heart, Esteban is able to convince Juan to proceed with the performance of Pagliacci by telling him the truth about his and Mischa's financial arrangement. Juan's performance ends up being a triumph, with Juan emotionally spent after it. Mischa remarks that this Juan and the Juan at the audition are two totally different people. Mischa now wants to sign a legitimate contract with Juan. Regardless, Juan does not recover emotionally. As Esteban takes him back to Seville, Juan is bedridden, dying from a broken heart.

It was shot at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City. Before the premiere, the title was changed to Call of the Flesh because the original title made it sound too much like a musical. Ramon Novarro apparently hated the new title.Soares, André; Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martin's Press, New York, 2002; p. 160 This film marked Novarro's fourth film appearance with Renée Adorée, and his third with Dorothy Jordan.Soares, André; Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martin's Press, New York, 2002; p. 153 Charles Brabin had been the original director on Novarro's Ben- Hur before Brabin had been fired from that project; however, the firing had taken place before Novarro's hiring, and the two had thus not worked together on that film. Novarro would later claim that he, not Brabin, actually directed most of Call of the Flesh.Soares, André; Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martin's Press, New York, 2002; p. 154 Novarro insisted that Renée Adorée be cast in the film opposite him, despite the fact that she was extremely ill with tuberculosis. The actress suffered two hemorrhages during production which almost shut the project down. In one instance, Novarro tried to convince production supervisor Hunt Stromberg to relieve Adorée of her duties and reshoot her material with another actress, offering to waive his salary, but Stromberg insisted, against doctor's orders, that it would be too expensive. After completing her last scene, Adorée had a second hemorrhage again and lost consciousness; she was rushed to a sanitarium in La Crescenta. Though Adorée survived two more years, her health effectively ended her chances at a continued career. Call of the Flesh was her last film. Release and reception Call of the Flesh was released on August 16, 1930. It received mixed reviews. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times said it was well directed but described the plot as 'somewhat lethargic.' Variety said the film was uneven overall, and the New York Morning Telegraph said the storyline was 'banal.' Despite a growing distaste for musicals among the general public, the movie was financially successful. In some theaters, the film was accompanied by a comedy called The Great Pants Mystery.The Times-News, Florence, Alabama; February 23, 1931; p. 4 No film of this title is listed on the Internet Movie Database. At the Capitol Theater in New York City, the film was accompanied by a Stepin Fetchit performance of Bye Bye Blues staged by Chester Hale. Call of the Flesh has not been released on DVD or video. It has been broadcast on television, and these versions of the film do not include any footage in Technicolor, which show Novarro's performance of an aria from Pagliacci. A still survives showing Novarro dressed as Pagliacci, posed alongside actor Ernest Torrence. Alternate-language versions As with several American films made between 1930 and 1932, Call of the Flesh was remade into two alternate foreign-language versions. The process of filming alternate-language versions was common in the American film industry in the early 1930s and continued until improved dubbing technology became available. Novarro appears in both alternate versions, reprising his role as Juan de Dios Carbajal, and directed both of them. They were filmed using a different crew and supporting cast on the same sets at MGM Studios. A German-language version, also to be directed by Novarro, was never filmed for financial reasons.Soares, André; Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martin's Press, New York, 2002; p. 163 La Sevillana or Sevilla de mis amores La Sevillana was the Spanish-language version, co-starring Conchita Montenegro as María, along with José Soriano Viosca, Rosita Ballesteros and Michael Vavitch. Novarro's mother, Leonor Pérez Gavilán de Samaniego, makes her only film appearance as Mother Superior of the convent. Ramón Guerrero, who appears in the film, translated the original screenplay, and Novarro translated the song lyrics, assisted by Herbert Stothart. The film cost $103,437 and premiered at the Teatro Califórnia Internacionale in Los Angeles on December 5, 1930.Soares, André; Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martin's Press, New York, 2002; p. 374 The production of La Sevillana marked Novarro's first performance in Spanish, his first language. It is credited with boosting the career of Conchita Montenegro.Waldman, Harry; Hollywood and the Foreign Touch: a Dictionary of Foreign Filmmakers and their Films from America, 1910-1995; p. 265 Le chanteur de Séville Le chanteur de Séville was the French- language version, adapted by Yvan Noé and Anne Mauclair, co-starring Suzy Vernon, Pierrette Caillol, Georges Mauloy, Mathilde Comont (reprising her role from Call of the Flesh), Carrie Daumery and Ramón Guerrero. It cost $96,598 and premiered on February 21, 1931, at the Théâtre de la Madeleine in Paris.

Background The scheme is for students in England and Wales, with a similar scheme in Scotland and Northern Ireland DSA's are grants to help toward meeting the additional studying costs or expenses that students face as a direct result of a disability or specific learning difficulty. They are intended to help disabled students study on an equal basis with other students. Full-time, part-time and postgraduate students all qualify for help. DSA's are paid on top of the standard student finance package and are not means-tested. The Disabled Students Allowance consists of three elements: # an Equipment Allowance # a Non-medical Helpers Allowance # a General Allowance In addition to this, in certain circumstances, there is the possibility that additional travel related expenses can be met. All approved expenditure must be in relation to course / education related support. The equipment allowance is used to obtain assistive technology (e.g. computer software and hardware, recording devices, ergonomic items) which may be required to facilitate full access to the course and the institution. Non- medical help relates to any human support, such as note-taking or the use of sign language interpreters, that may be required. The general allowance is typically used to cover the cost of sundry items. Possible examples include paying for internet connections, books (under some circumstances), ink cartridges and paper, photocopying or coloured overlays. The DSA was established in 1993 and is not a Student Finance Direct initiative. The administration of this grant in England has been transferred from Local Education Authorities (LEA)'s to Student Finance England for new applicants in 2009. In Wales it will remain the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly Government, and continue to be administered by the individual local authorities. To receive funds from the DSA, students must pass the basic eligibility checks for Student Finance Direct products as well as the criteria for disability, by providing the funding body with written proof of the disability from a medical professional. For those with a specific learning disability (e.g. dyslexia, dyspraxia) suitable proof can be in the form of a report from an appropriately qualified and approved individual such as an Educational Psychologist or Specialist Teacher. The only other requirement is that any report be completed when the individual in question is over the age of sixteen. The potential benefits, in terms of equipment (such as a new laptop computer and specialist software) can be significant for students identified as dyslexic. Most universities will be able to put students in touch with an appropriately qualified person who can assess them and produce an acceptable report. For other disabilities and medical conditions correspondence from a doctor or consultant is generally sufficient. The Funding Body then asks the student to have an Assessment of Need to establish exactly what assistance is required from The DSA and the student's institution -see for accredited Centres.. DSA QAG, who were the governing body have closed down as of December 2019. Disabled students should be aware that the cost of any needs assessment is met from the total amount of DSA available to them. The Assessment Centre is paid for their work from the student's DSA funds (approximately £660 - £800 a time) and while this reduces the total amount of funds available to the student it is recognised by the funding bodies as being an effective way of detailing the support package and resources the student requires and of ensuring that the support package addresses all the student's needs and includes appropriate warranties and insurance. Assessment Centres (which are audited for this work) are also charged with ensuring \\"value for money\\". The Assessment of Need is intended to identify the specific details of support for each individual student. Lasting anywhere from 90 to 180 minutes (sometimes more, split over more than one appointment, for complex cases) they should cover all of the potential support needs that may arise including the institutional provisions necessary. A report is produced that contains recommendations for support, including any equipment. For students with dyslexia these reports can seem similar, with good reason, but might contain subtle differences which align the support package to the individual needs of the student. The recommendations contained within the report have to be \\"approved\\" by the student's funding body; there are strict guidelines followed by Funding Bodies to ensure that the support provided fulfils the purpose of the DSA. All disabled students should be aware that the award is made to them as individuals and they are free to source approved equipment on their own, with the consent of the funding body and subject to the limits approved. However, it is often more convenient and less troublesome for students if they take advantage of the offer by funding bodies to order equipment on behalf of the student (via DSA QAG approved suppliers) and by assessment centres/HEIs to organise the support a student needs. This can only be done if the student agrees. Students are encouraged by Funding Bodies, to only use DSA-QAG approved equipment suppliers - these suppliers have agreed to meet the terms of a service level agreement set out by DSA-QAG and if anything goes wrong with their equipment will receive a more understanding response from their funding body. Many Assessment Centres have their own preferred suppliers (who will be DSA-QAG approved) who they will work closely with. This will be an arrangement arising out of a wish to ensure that the students receiving specialist equipment are well supported by a supplier. It also means that a very small number of suppliers are able to provide equipment and therefore control the market. Once approval is given, arrangements for purchase of equipment and facilitation of human support (where appropriate) can be made. Once equipment is received by the student it is deemed to be their property. Universities often have the ability to facilitate human support and training in-house. Increasingly though, as HEIs start to appreciate the complexities of quality support service provision, this function is being outsourced. Some Assessment Centers also provide this kind of support although the issue of Conflict of interest can arise, which they must address as a result of being DSA-QAG Accredited Centres: a cosy grouping of interested parties such as assessment centres and equipment suppliers operating a closed shop to keep control and monopolise the whole business. Training providers and those facilitating human support to students with disabilities are able to add an administration premium when invoicing a student's funding body. This is regarded as acceptable practice within higher education to meet the overhead costs - e.g. recruiting, training, payroll, insurance etc. but does impact negatively upon the funds available for supporting each individual. However, this does avoid the difficulties students would experience if they were to employ their own support workers - i.e. of employer responsibilities including tax and NI. Although students could avoid the requirement to directly employ support workersby utilising third party service providers. Higher Education institutions receive a nominal amount of funding for each student confirmed as being in receipt of DSA . This comes from the Funding Council and not out of individual student's DSA. The institutions therefore have a vested (financial) interest in identifying as many students eligible to claim DSA as possible and in getting them to apply for DSA. In Autumn 2000 the grants were extended to include those studying part-time as well as full-time. The DfES estimated that in the year 2002-03, 25,000 DSA claims were accepted in the UK. A report on the BBC Ouch! website in 2003 claimed that some disabled students did not have their equipment and/or an agreement in place from their LEA when they arrived at university. SKILL, the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities, a charity that helps disabled students in Higher education, claimed that, this was due to the \\"Efficiency of the LEA, coupled with fitting into an assessment timetable all within the short time-frame between exam results being released (mid-August) and the start of the new term at university (late September)\\". That same year though, new working methods were introduced that helped cut down any delays. Prospective students planning to enter higher education are free to apply for DSA from approximately the March prior to the commencement of their course. Students already enrolled on a course can apply at any time. However, SFE and other funding bodies will make financial decisions taking into account the amount of time a student's course has to run. Those administering the funds are responsible for ensuring they are spent in an appropriate manner and it is very unlikely that a student applying for the first time with just a few months of a course left would receive recommendations and approval for a large package of support, especially in terms of equipment. Currently the amount of funding from DSA for a full-time undergraduate is: Equipment allowance - £5,161 - over the course Non-medical help allowance - £20,520 - per annum General allowance - £1,724 - per annum The equipment allowance amount is for the duration of the course. The non- medical help and general allowances are annual figures. Where payable there is currently no upper limit on travel expenses. Part-time students receive proportionate amounts depending on the intensity of their study. Postgraduates have not previously been as well funded as undergraduates.

It may date back to the American colony of New Sweden, when in 1637 Peter Gunnarsson Rambo, a Swedish immigrant, arrived on the Kalmar Nyckel. Swedish natural historian Pehr Kalm, who wrote Travels in North America, 1747–51, took notes of his interview with Mr. Peter Rambo, grandson of Peter Gunnarsson Rambo, recording that the ″original Peter Rambo had brought apple seeds and several other tree and garden seeds with him in a box.″ The first Rambo apple tree was very likely grown from one of these seeds. There is no certainty, however, since the earliest documented mention of the apple variety's origin occurs in William Coxe's A View of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees, and the Management of Orchards and Cider, published in 1817. Coxe wrote only that the Rambo was much cultivated in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey and took \\"its name from the families by whom it was introduced into notice.\\" Since apple trees do not grow true from seed,http://gage.unl.edu/applesandmostfruitarenottruetoseed and Rambo brought seeds, not scionwood, if the first Rambo tree grew from one of those seeds, the variety would be one of the first truly American apples. The name Rambo was most likely derived from Peter Gunnarsson's Swedish home on Ramberget (or \\"Raven Mountain\\") on the island of Hisingen, which today is part of Gothenburg, but in Gunnarsson's time was mostly farmland. One translation of \\"bo\\" from Swedish to English is \\"resident.\\" The Rambo is very similar in traits, such as size, shape, and coloring, to several French apples called Rambour. There is no known explanation for the similarity of the names. The Rambo has a greenish yellow skin, mottled and striped with a dull red and overspread with a grayish bloom. Rambo apples ripen in early to late fall, depending on the region of the country. The fruit is medium-sized on average, but sometimes large. The apple has a distinctive flavor and aroma. Very versatile, the Rambo has been rated very good to excellent for fresh eating, cooking and baking, jelly, and drying. Little known today, the Rambo was once widely grown, but in a limited geographical range from the mid-Atlantic states west into the middle Prairie states. In Varieties of Apples in Ohio (1915), the \\"little old-fashioned Rambo\\" was said to have been found \\"in almost every old orchard in Ohio.\\" It was also found in Oregon and Northern California. In 1847, the Rambo was included among the 18 varieties of apple trees that Henderson Luelling of Salem, Iowa brought with his family along the Oregon Trail to establish the first orchard in the Pacific Northwest.History of Fruit Growing in the Pacific Northwest, Henderson Luelling and Seth Lewelling url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cor/cool/luelling.html The Rambo belongs to the era when people bought apples from local suppliers and grew apple trees in their backyard. Even a hundred years ago, the Rambo was not widely grown commercially. There were several reasons that it was considered to be unmarketable. It did not have bright coloring. Its productivity was inconsistent. It did not have a long storage life. It was too tender for shipping long distances. So as not to confuse the Rambo apple with the unrelated Summer Rambo (also known as the Rambour Franc), the Rambo has also been called the Winter Rambo. Other names given to the Rambo over the years include Romanite, Bread and Cheese (perhaps after Bread and Cheese Island in Delaware), Seek-No-Further, Delaware, and Striped Rambo. In popular culture According to author David Morrell, the apple provided the name for the hero of his novel, First Blood, which gave rise to the Rambo film franchise. The novelist's wife brought home a supply of the fruit as he was trying to come up with a suitable name for the protagonist. It is uncertain whether David Morrell's wife brought home Rambos or Summer Rambos. Summer Rambos would have been much more common, but since his wife bought the apples at a roadside stand, either is possible. James Whitcomb Riley, the Hoosier Poet, sentimentalized the Rambo in his poem, The Rambo-Tree which appeared in his 1902 collection The Book of Joyous Children. The poem includes the repeating chorus: For just two truant lads like we, When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree There's enough for you and enough for me It's a long, sweet way across the orchard. A similar sentiment was expressed by \\"Uncle Silas\\" in his column for the September 1907 issue of The American Thresherman: \\"What has become of the good old apples we used to eat in the long ago down on the farm? The Rambo, the best apple that ever grew in an orchard, is fruit vouchsafed only in memory. [In Missouri,] no apple was ever enjoyed like the Rambo.... A boy would go farther to swipe Rambo apples, and subject his pantaloons to greater exposure from ugly dogs than he would for any other kind, and boys know on which tree the best apples grow. A drink of cider without any fixin', made of Rambo apples, will go farther down and awake the molecules of mankind in a greater degree than any other kind of cider. The world is growing wiser, but not in raising Rambo apples.\\" The claim that the Rambo was the favorite apple of Johnny Appleseed is false. Johnny Appleseed did not grow or sell any grafted varieties, and for the Rambo or any other variety to be perpetuated, it must be grafted. As Michael Pollan indicates in his chapter on the apple in Botany of Desire, John Chapman (1774–1845), for religious reasons related to the doctrines of Emanuel Swedenborg, believed grafting was an unnatural practice. Chapman was given the nickname \\"Appleseed\\" pejoratively for his highly unusual practice of planting trees from seed. Apples grown from seed are most often small and poorly flavored. Back when the frontier only extended as far west as the state of Indiana, that worked fine for Johnny Appleseed, since the apples from his trees were used principally for making hard cider. Also the pioneers didn't have any other choice in suppliers. The apple tree in Nova, Ohio, that is more than 175 years old, can either be the last surviving apple tree that Johnny Appleseed planted or it can be a Rambo tree. It cannot be both, despite any marketing claims. References Bibliography * Coxe, William. A view of the cultivation of fruit trees, and the management of orchards and cider., 253pp, M.

He coined the name Lymphocytic choriomeningitis in 1934 after isolating the hitherto completely unknown virus. He discovered in 1939 that poliovirus can be transmitted to cotton rats, and started self-tests with nasal spray vaccination.  Education  In 1905 Charles Armstrong graduated from Alliance High School and went on to Mount Union College Preparatory School from 1905–1906. He took a B.S. degree from Mount Union College, Alliance, Ohio in 1910. In 1915 he graduated from Johns Hopkins Medical School, with an M.D. degree and did a General Internship at Yale-New Haven Hospital until 1916.  Civilian career  Thomas M. Rivers, Charles Armstrong, John R. Paul, Thomas Francis Jr., Albert Sabin, Joseph L. Melnick, Isabel Morgan, Howard A. Howe, David Bodian, Jonas Salk, Eleanor Roosevelt and Basil O'Connor. On October 16, 1916, he was commissioned to the U.S. Public Health Service and served for six weeks at the Immigration Station, Ellis Island, New York. From November 1916 to September 1918, he was Medical Officer on the United States Coast Guard Cutter (CSG) Seneca assigned to Cuban and European waters for 17 months until the ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy during World War I. When in the fall of 1918 local outbreaks of pandemic influenza occurred, Armstrong was a member of the investigating team. From 1919 to 1921, he worked as an Epidemiological Aide to the Ohio State Department of Health. For the next decades, from 1921 until his retirement from active duty in 1950 he worked at the Hygienic Laboratory, remaining there through its administrative and name changes to the National Institutes of Health. From 1950 to 1963, Armstrong continued at the Institute, doing daily research work without compensation. Armstrong was married to Elizabeth Alberta Rich from 1920 till his death. He had one daughter Mary Emma (*1924). His papers were donated to the National Library of Medicine by Dr. Leake and Mary Emma Armstrong in 1972.  Virological research  Armstrong's worldwide recognition as a virologist is due (a) to his discovery, in 1934, of the virus that is the agent in a clinical entity, which he named lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) and (b) to his successful work in polio research and polio prevention.  LCM  In 1934 Armstrong isolated a previously undescribed neurotropic virus found during the experimental transmission of encephalitis virus from the 1933 St. Louis epidemic from which it was differentiated and he demonstrated the virus in the central nervous system, spinal fluid, blood and urine of monkeys and in the brain and blood of mice during the experimental disease. In the majority of the monkeys there was more or less diffuse and irregular cellular infiltration of the meninges. In most animals there was a more or less pronounced swelling, edema and lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid plexus, i.e. the cellular membrane lining the intracerebral ventricles, which led him to name the disease lymphocytic choriomeningitis.For a detailed coverage of Armstrong's research work see: Beeman, pages 179 – 207  Polio  Armstrong's bronze bust at Warm Springs While still doing research work on LCM in 1939, Armstrong was able, for the first time, to adapt and transmit a human strain of poliovirus (the rarer and less dangerous Lansing type 2 strainnamed after Lansing, Michigan, from where Armstrong had got human brain material) from monkeys to small rodents, first to the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus hispidus) and then to white mice. This accomplishment was revolutionary as it made possible the study of many aspects of infection and immunity in humans that could scarcely have been carried out with monkeys. The discovery also stimulated the renewal of efforts to adapt and establish the other immunologic types of poliomyelitis, leading to methods that resulted in the eventual developments of successful vaccines for poliomyelitis.detailed coverage in: Beeman, pages 217–241 In recognition of his achievements in polio research and prevention Armstrong was inducted into the Polio Hall of Fame in Warm Springs, Georgia.

It is located in the west of downtown Toronto, within the Grange Park neighbourhood, one block north of Dundas Street West, between Beverley and McCaul Streets. The former modestly sized homes on the street have been converted to restaurants and small shops selling arts, crafts and curios. History The street was laid out and named after William Warren Baldwin, who owned much of the area, in the early nineteenth century. The neighbourhood developed in the early 20th century as the Jewish ghetto moved westward from its original location in The Ward towards what became the Kensington Market Jewish community, and the strip became home to a number of Jewish stores and restaurants. As the Jewish community moved north from downtown, the area's proximity to Chinatown led it to be populated by Chinese-Canadians. Also close to the University of Toronto and surrounded by the area known as the \\"Student Ghetto\\" it also became a centre for the 1960s youth movements. Most notably it was the central location for draft dodgers from the Vietnam War in Toronto. The draft dodgers converted a number of homes to shops catering to the new community. In 1978 the first cafe on the block opened, and since then the area has become one of the best known restaurant districts in Toronto. Mandel's Creamery at 29 Baldwin Street, the last remnant of the block's Jewish heritage, closed in 1995 after 90 years of operation, though the Yiddish lettering on its window has been preserved by the John's Italian Caffe, the neighbouring establishment at 27 Baldwin which expanded into the Mandel's former property.http://www.grangecommunity.ca/grange/baldwin-village John's Italian Caffe, in turn, closed in 2014.

Wrangel: Die Rassen des Pferdes, 1909 Ethiopian horses are those breeds or types of horse found in Ethiopia, formerly known as Abyssinia. There are about 2.8 million horses in Ethiopia, more than half the total in the African continent. Ethiopia reports only the Abyssinian breed to DAD-IS. In 2012 the horses of Ethiopia were characterised into eight distinct breeds or types with different regional distributions, including a gravely-endangered feral population, the Kundudo horse.  History  Horses from Ethiopia, formerly known as Abyssinia, were in the past described as a single type, the \\"Abyssinian Horse\\" or \\"Ethiopian Horse\\", of variable size, colour and conformation. In 1997 two distinct types, the Oromo and Dongola, were described. Morphological research published in 2012 characterised eight distinct breeds or types with different regional distributions. In 2007 no population data was available to the FAO, and no assessment of conservation status was made.  Characteristics  Eight distinct breeds or regional types of horse are found in Ethiopia.  Abyssinian  The Abyssinian type or breed is found mostly in the northern part of Ethiopia, particularly in the Semien Mountains in the area of Gondar, in the Amhara Region. It is poorly conformed, sway-backed and heavy in the belly. It is much used in agricultural work.  Bale  The Bale breed or type has poor conformation, with a heavy belly and sway back. It is found in highland areas of the Bale Zone of the Oromia Region, in the southern part of the country.  Borana  The Borana is a lowland breed kept by the pastoral Borana Oromo people, particularly in the area of the city of Megga in southern Ethiopia. It is of good conformation, is always bay, and is not used for draught work.  Horro  The Horro or Horo breed is a poorly-conformed agricultural horse from the Horo area of western Oromia Region, in the west of Ethiopia.  Kafa  The Kafa is a well-conformed and robust breed from the rain-forests of Sheka and Keffa zones of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region.  Kundudo  The Kundudo is a gravely-endangered population of feral horses, of unknown origin, from the area of the Kundudo plateau near the city of Harar, in the Misraq Hararghe zone of Oromia.  Ogaden  The Somali, Ogaden or Wilwal is a well-conformed breed from the Somali Region of Ethiopia (the traditional Ogaden), and is concentrated in the area of the city of Jijiga.  Selale  The Selale or Oromo is a good breed of riding horse from the Shewa area of central Ethiopia.  Use  Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world. About three-quarters of all farms are more than one and a half days' walk from an all-weather road. Horses, mules and donkeys are essential to transport and horses are extensively used for transport, traction and agricultural work such as ploughing. Some breeds, in some areas, are used mainly for riding.

The result was a victory for Prussian General von Zieten over a French army commanded by General Dominique Vandamme. Prelude After French defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the armies of the Duke of Wellington, Field Marshal von Blücher, and other Seventh Coalition forces, advanced upon Paris. Wellington and von Blücher continued their operations up to the gates of Paris and, on the 30 June, had recourse to a movement which proved decisive to the fate of the city. Marshal von Blücher, having taken the village of Aubervilliers, or Vertus, made a movement to his right, and, crossing the Seine at Saint-Germain below the capital, threw his whole force upon the south side of the city where no preparations had been made to resist an enemy. This was a thunderbolt to the French; it was then that their weakness and the Coalition's strength were seen most conspicuously, because at that moment the armies of Wellington and von Blücher were separated and the whole French army was between them, yet the French could not move to prevent their junction. After the war Lazare Carnot (Napoleon's Minister of Internal Affairs) blamed Napoleon for not fortifying Paris on the south side, and claimed he had forewarned Napoleon of this danger. The French were thus obliged to abandon all the works they had constructed for the defence of the capital, and moved their army across the Seine to meet the Prussians. Although a Prussian brigade was defeated in a skirmish at Rocquencourt near Versailles, the movement of the Prussians to the right was not checked. On the morning of the 2 July, the Prussian I Corps under the command of General Graf von Zieten had its right wing positioned at Plessis-Piquet, its left at Meudon, with its reserves at Versailles. Attack Zieten advanced on the 2 July towards the heights of Meudon and Châtillon and fought a sharp battle for the possession of Sèvres, Moulineaux, and Issy. The contest was obstinate, but the Prussians finally surmounted all difficulties and succeeded in establishing themselves firmly upon the heights of Meudon and in the village of Issy. The French losses during this engagement are estimated at 3,000 men. Counterattack At a French Council of War, which was held during the night of 2/3 July in Paris, it was decided that the defence of the capital was not practicable against the two Coalition armies. Nevertheless, the French Commander-in-Chief Marshal Davout was desirous of another attempt before he would finally agree to a suspension of hostilities. At three o'clock on the morning of the 3 July Vandamme, commander of the French III Corps, advanced in two columns from Vaugirard to attack Issy. Between Vaugirard and the river Seine he had a considerable force of cavalry, the front of which was flanked by a battery advantageously posted near Auteuil on the right bank of the river. The action commenced with a brisk cannonade, the French having brought twenty pieces of cannon against the front of the village which was then vigorously assailed by his infantry. The Prussians had constructed some barricades and other defences during the night; but these did not protect them from the sharp fire of case shot which was poured upon them by the French batteries, the guns of which enfiladed the streets. The 12th and 24th Prussian Regiments, and the 2nd Westphalian Landwehr, supported by a half battery of twelve pounders, fought with great bravery against the French. There was many losses on both sides. At length the French withdrew, but only to advance again, considerably reinforced. The 2nd Prussian Brigade was immediately ordered to join the 1st, and the whole of the troops of the I Prussian Corps stood to arms. Zieten sent a request to Blücher for the support of two brigades of Bülow's IV Prussian Corps and, at the same time, begged Thielemann to advance (in conformity with instructions conveyed to him from headquarters) from Châtillon and to threaten the French left flank. In the meantime the French renewed their attack upon Issy, which, however, again proved unsuccessful. This was followed by a heavy cannonade and by further assaults, without any decided advantage having been gained over the defenders. The French did not appear disposed to venture upon a more general attack, which would have offered them a much greater chance of forcing back the Prussian advanced guard; the French commanders probably considered that such an attack, if unsuccessful, might end with the suburbs of Paris being easily carried by storm. Accordingly, after four hours' continued but fruitless attempts upon Zieten's advanced position, the French fell back upon Paris, with the Prussian skirmishers following them until they came within a very short distance of the barriers surrounding the city. Aftermath Issy was the final attempt of the French army to defend Paris and, with this defeat, all hope of holding Paris faded. The French high command decided that they would capitulate. Accordingly, at seven o'clock in the morning, the French ceased fire and Brigadier General (chief of staff to the French III Corps) was delegated to approach Zieten's Corps, which was the nearest to the capital of all the Coalition forces, to offer a capitulation and to request an immediate armistice. On hearing of the unilateral French ceasefire, Blücher demanded that the French provide delegates with full powers of negotiation before he would finally agree to a suspension of hostilities, and indicated the Palace of St. Cloud as the place where the negotiations should be carried on. He then moved his headquarters to the palace. Officers furnished with full powers by their respective chiefs soon met at St. Cloud, where the Duke of Wellington had joined Prince Blücher. The result of their deliberations was the surrender of Paris under the terms of the Convention of St. Cloud. Napoleon Bonaparte had already announced his abdication (24 June 1815); unable to remain in France or to escape from it, a few days later, on 15 July, he surrendered himself to Captain Maitland of HMS Bellerophon and was transported to England. The full restoration of Louis XVIII followed the emperor's departure. Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled to the island of Saint Helena, where he died in May 1821.

Oldin; and commissioned at Seattle, Washington on 9 March 1943, Lieutenant Commander Lewis Williams in command. World War II Departing Seattle, Washington on 24 March, Kern arrived San Pedro, California on 28 March for shakedown. On 12 April, she joined a convoy out of Los Angeles, California, and reached Pearl Harbor on the 22nd. Loaded with aviation gas and diesel oil, she steamed to Midway Island from 8–12 June. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 June, and from 27 June-11 July she made a similar run to Canton and Palmyra Islands. During the next year, Kern continued tanker operations out of Pearl Harbor, supplying American bases on Midway, Canton, and Palmyra Islands with gasoline and oil. Departing Pearl Harbor on 19 August 1944, she sailed to Eniwetok, Marshalls, where she arrived on 31 August and served as station tanker during September. She departed Eniwetok on 5 October and carried gasoline to the Marianas and Ulithi before reaching Kossol Roads, Palaus on 28 October. End-of-war operations From November 1944-July 1945, Kern served as a station tanker at Kossol Roads and as a shuttle tanker to Peleliu and Angaur. In addition, she made replenishment runs between the Palaus and Ulithi during March, May, and June. Departing Kossol on 21 July, she steamed via Ulithi to Guam where she arrived on 6 August for overhaul. Post-war service Following the end of hostilities in the Pacific Ocean, Kern returned to Ulithi on 31 August. She steamed to Okinawa from 17–21 September and served as station tanker until sailing for Japan on 13 October.

Plot Danny, an acclaimed singer and songwriter, falls in love with a socialite girl who he then overhears admitting that she is stringing him along just in time to avoid marriage. Danny is notably Jewish, and among the issues the movie raises is his temptation to assimilate into the larger culture. The film is an adaptation of a play that riffed on the real-life relationship between songwriter Irving Berlin and Long Island socialite Ellin Mackay, which was all over the gossip columns in the late 1920s. Mackay's millionaire father cut her off and did not speak to her for years because, after a long courtship, she married Berlin, who was Jewish. (Unlike the fickle debutante in the film, Mackay stayed with Berlin, and their marriage lasted over sixty years.)

The environmental conservation team is led by Barry Kerr, an experienced South African conservation and environmentalist. His partner Adele Kerr carries out marketing and oversees the growing and vital community development programme. In 2010, as a result of the work done by project African Wilderness and their Malawian sister company the Mwabvi Wildlife and Community Trust (MWCT) Mwabvi opened Njate Lodge for tourists. Reserve Size The reserve is now less than half its original size, wood and game poaching continue and PAW are first working to stop deliberate fires which destroy seedlings and saplings. If the habitat goes the animals will not come back. The Department of National Parks and Wildlife has up to 12 game scouts at Mwabvi but they have neither resources nor support to prevent poaching and protect the wilderness. PAW has one of several 'concessions' given to various organisations by the Government to try out different ways of exploiting the natural resources for tourism. Mwabvi will never be a major tourist destination but the area lends itself to use for conservation training, and over time game scout training will take place. The former National Game Scout Training Centre at Liwonde National Park closed some time ago and the country needs more trained game scouts. Geographics When working in this part of Malawi it is necessary to take into account that there are 60,000 people living around the edge of the Reserve - this is a highly populated area. The local primary school has 2 teachers, 2 classrooms and 250 pupils. The nearest town, Bangula, has a primary school with 6 classrooms, 8 staff and 3,000 pupils. Life expectancy is 32. The Malawi average life expectancy is 38 years. AIDS and malaria often kills game scouts just five years after they are trained, and hardly any of the local children know the reserve exists. Any person or organisation working in this part of sub Saharan Africa should expect to be there for the long term and save the natural environment for future generations. It is essential to work with the local people, be involved with appropriate education programmes, and not rely on short term grants and aid. Mission The list of projects needed to create a sustainable programme for the long term that PAW and others are working on covers: * Protection and restoration of the wildlife reserve * Eco-tourism * Small Enterprise Development * University twinning scheme * Secondary school education programme * Volunteer programme * Fundraising Project African Wilderness has charitable status in the United Kingdom and operates through the Mwabvi Wildlife and Community Trust in Malawi with volunteers and paid professional employees in both countries. Employing over 50 local people, PAW and MWCT have significantly extended the road system within the reserve and have built a lodge and a campsite, thus opening up the park for tourism. They have also extended the facilities at Chipembere Camp, providing volunteer accommodation and facilities for their various outreach projects. They also run a growing predator breeding programme, and have enclosures for a number of lions and other cats. References *Bradt Guide to Malawi, Phillip Briggs and Mary-Anne Bartlett. 4th Edition.

Since 1938 it is located in the center of Belgrade, in 61 Cara Dušana Street, the place where once Vidin Gate stood, through which people could enter Belgrade. The Church of St. Alexander Nevsky is located near the school. In October 1838, Kragujevac was Serbia's capital. But despite Kragujevac being the cultural center of Serbia at the time, Miloš Obrenović ordered for First Belgrade Gymnasium (grammar school) to be founded in Belgrade, in an area called Dorćol (Dort-yol). The school was founded on 18 June 1839. At that time, it was located in Jug Bogdan's Street number 26, which was the residence of Nikola Selaković. At the very beginning, the school had only 2 grades, but through the next 4 years, the school's system greatly upgraded so at the end, it had 5 grades. In the 1842–43 school year, it could be said that the school actually became a real gymnasium. The first school professors were Vasilije Berara and Mihajlo Popović, and the school's headmaster was Mihajlo Popović. According to law from 1844, thanks to Jovan Sterija Popović, teachings and classes in the school were reformed, so that the 6th grade was actually added to the school's system. With this addition, First Belgrade Gymnasium receives the same status like other European higher class schools. That year, the school got its first school library and first school books.

Murphy (born May 9, 1981 in Anaheim, California) is an American professional baseball left-handed pitcher and is currently a free-agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks and Toronto Blue Jays, with an 0-0 record in the Major Leagues. He has also played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Chiba Lotte Marines being one of the most highly known pitchers in Japan during the 2010 season. Murphy and Yu Darvish were both the top leading Aces in Japan for the 2010 season, yet Murphy being the dominant force for his team, the Chiba Lotte Marines to win the 2010 Japan Series. He has also played in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) for the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions. Bill Murphy is the only player in Major League Baseball history to be traded three times in less than a 24-hour time period, in the Paul Lo Duca, Brad Penny, Hee-seop Choi, Juan Encarnacion and Guillermo Mota trade. Murphy attended Arlington High School in Riverside, California. After graduating from high school, Murphy was granted a baseball scholarship to CSU Northridge. Before attending college, he was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 24th round (738th overall) in the 1999 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign with them. After attending California State University, Northridge for three years, Murphy was selected as the 98th overall pick in the third-round of the 2002 famous Moneyball draft. Career Oakland Athletics He was drafted again by the Oakland Athletics in the third round (98th overall) of the 2002 \\"Moneyball\\" draft. He spent two seasons in the Athletics organization, pitching for the Vancouver Canadians (2002), Kane County Cougars (2003) and Midland RockHounds (2003). On June 10, 2003, Bill pitched a no-hitter for the Kane County Cougars. Florida Marlins On December 23, 2003, he was sent to the Florida Marlins as the player to be named later that had sent Mark Redman to the Athletics and Mike Neu to the Marlins in a trade on December 16, 2003. Murphy began the 2004 season with the Carolina Mudcats, the Marlins Double-A affiliate. In 20 starts with the Mudcats, he was 6-4 with a 4.08 ERA. Arizona Diamondbacks On July 30, 2004, Murphy was traded along with Hee-Seop Choi and Brad Penny to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Paul Lo Duca, Juan Encarnación, and Guillermo Mota. The next day, on July 31, 2004, he was traded once again, this time to the Arizona Diamondbacks along with Koyie Hill and Reggie Abercrombie for Steve Finley and Brent Mayne. He finished the season with the Double-A El Paso Diablos. Murphy spent the whole 2005 season with the Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders but performed poorly as he had a 5.65 ERA in 23 games (21 starts). He began the 2006 season back in Double-A with the Tennessee Smokies. He was later promoted back up to Triple-A. In 2007, Murphy once again began the year in Triple-A. He started nine games in which he went 2–2 with a 4.05 ERA. He was mainly a relief pitcher however as he pitched 45 games out of the bullpen. He went 1–1 with a 3.35 ERA with 1 save out of the bullpen. His good performance earned him a September 1 call-up by the big league club. He made his Major League debut against the San Diego Padres on September 3, working 1.2 innings in relief and allowing three earned runs on 3 hits and 3 walks. In 10 games for the Diamondbacks in 2007, he had a 5.68 ERA. In , during spring training, the Diamondbacks designated Murphy for assignment and placed him on waivers. Toronto Blue Jays The Toronto Blue Jays claimed him off waivers on March 17.Jays pick up Murphy off waivers Murphy did not make the 25-man Toronto 2009 roster out of spring training, and was assigned to Triple-A Las Vegas 51s. On April 14, 2009, Murphy was called up to the Toronto Blue Jays to replace the injured Jesse Litsch.Murphy fills Jays' bullpen void Murphy made his Toronto debut on April 15 in relief, in a win over the Minnesota Twins. On November 3, 2009 he was designated for assignment to make room for Jarrett Hoffpauir. In 8 games with the Blue Jays, he worked in 11.1 innings with a 3.18 ERA. Chiba Lotte Marines On November 15, 2009, it was announced that Murphy would take a tryout for the Japanese team Chiba Lotte Marines. In 2010 Murphy led the Chiba Lotte Marines to the Japan World Series helping the team to win the championship along with being one of the top pitchers starting off the year undefeated 6-0 until his first loss against Yu Darvish. In 2010 Murphy eventually held one of the best records finishing with 12 wins and 6 losses, with a better record than most in Japan including pitchers like Yu Darvish, with a 3.75ERA on the season. He played with the Marines in 2010 and 2011, appearing in 48 games, with 30 starts. In both seasons with the Chiba Lotte Marines he finished with a combined 14-11 record and an overall 3.81 ERA. He made history in 2010 by winning 6 consecutive games in Japan without a loss. Return to the Blue Jays He returned to the Blue Jays on a minor league contract on January 17, 2012 and was assigned to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s. Murphy spent the entire 2012 season with the Las Vegas 51's with another winning record of 8-5 and an overall 4.38 ERA. Being one of the top pitchers with innings pitched in the PCL that season, Murphy was not granted a September call-up though his performance as starter/reliever is difficult in itself in the Pacific Coast League Triple-A, leaving many second guessing the Major League Affiliated Club of the Toronto Blue Jays. Long Island Ducks/Camden Riversharks/7-Eleven Lions Murphy played the 2013 season for the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, helping lead them to yet another championship. In August 2014, it was announced that Murphy signed with the Camden Riversharks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 2 starts of the 2014 season, Murphy has started 2 games, pitched 10 innings with 0 runs, 0.00 ERA and is 1-0 on the year in the 2014 Atlantic League. After performing 2 scoreless starts with the Riversharks, going 1-0 with 10 scoreless innings, the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions of Taiwan purchased his contract for the remainder of the 2014 season in hopes of obtaining another championship.

Life and family Ballylahan Castle, built by Jordan de Exeter in 1239. De Exeter took his family name from the town of Exeter in Devon, England but it is not known if he or previous members of the family were the first in Ireland. He appears to have participated in Richard Mor de Burgh's conquest of Connacht in 1230s. De Burgh granted the barony or cantred of Gallen to Hugh de Lacy, who transferred it to Jordan de Exeter, who was in possession of it by 1239. In 1250 Henry III gave him twenty-five marks yearly \\"in reward of services until he should be given waste lands worth £20 a year, which were given about the parish of Killallaghtan in Galway, to be held by the service of one knight.\\" (p.307) He built the castle of Ballylahan - now on the junction of the N58 and R321 in County Mayo. It overlooked Athlethan, or Strade, where he built an abbey for the Franciscans but at the behest of his wife, transferred it to the Dominicans in 1253. His wife was Basilia de Bermingham, a daughter of Meyler de Bermingham, lord of Athenry. They had sons Meiler de Exeter (d. 1289) and Jordan Óge de Exeter (fl.1269-1319). Exploits Jordan is first recorded in the Annals of Connacht in 1247, when: > A great war was waged by Toirrdelbach son of Aed O Conbhobair and Donnchad > son of Anmchad son of Donnchad O Gillapatraic of Ossory against the Galls of > Connacht. Toirrdelbach assembled the kings' sons of Connacht and they > reached Fid O nDiarmata and Muinter Fathaig, where they killed some people, > and passed on to Galway, where they burned the town and the castle and where > very many people were killed, Donnchad O Gillaptraic of Ossory killing Mac > Elgeit, the Seneschal of Connacht. The Galls followed them up and engaged > them, and they killed a [further] number of Galls and escaped in spite of > them, coming afterwards to Carra. Jordan D'Exeter and the children of Adam > [Standon] and the Galls of Carra (Carra, County Mayo) assembled and moved > against Toirrdelbach, but he left the country to them, not being strong > enough to oppose them. In the following year, 1248, the same annals state that: > The sons of Magnus, and the son of Conchobar Ruad made a hosting and > revolted against the Galls. They burned Mac Henry's castle and captured its > warden and carried the preys of North Umall onto the islands of Clew Bay. > Then Jordan D'Exeter and John Butler and Robin Laigles and many others > assembled and marched first to Ballintober and thence to Aghagower, and next > day they plundered Umall, north and south. Then [Mac] Henry came into Umall > with a great army, for Umall belonged to him and he lived there. However, he > made peace with Domnall son of Magnus, who promised to supply him with men > and ships to attack his [i.e. Domnall's own] kinsmen.

For this was a victory with defeat, since that > valorous champion and well-tried warrior, Diarmait son of Magnus, was > himself killed. Sheriff of Connacht His most famous exploit was leading the cavalry charge that won the First Battle of Athenry in 1249. The Annals of Connacht relate that: > The kings' sons of Connacht made another hosting, to burn and pillage > Athenry, at the feast of Mary in mid-autumn. They went thither, a great > host, including Toirrdelbach son of Aed and Aed son of Aed, and the Sheriff > of Connacht was there to meet them, with many Galls. The Galls asked for a > truce on that day, on account of its sanctity; in honour of Mary Mother > whose day it was. The princes would not grant that truce to honour Mary or > the Crucifixion, but attacked the town, though Toirrdelbach was unwilling. > When Jordan [D'Exeter] and the Galls saw this they issued from the town > against the princes. Mary wrought a miracle then; for when the princes and > their followers saw the horsemen in arms and armour making towards them, > horror and dread seized them and they were put to flight.

Family and descendants De Exeter was the founder of the Mac Jordan, or Mac Síurtáin, family. The family held lands in the barony of Gallen in what is now County Mayo, later known as Tir Mac Síurtáin or Mac Síurtáin's Country. They became progressively Gaelicized over the succeeding generations, especially after the failure of the Norman colonies in Connacht. Their family name was anglicised to MacJordan and, in later times shortened to simply Jordan.http://www.araltas.com/features/jordan/ References *Knox, Robert Thomas.

The church also celebrated the anniversary by putting on a grand historical pageant in the costumes of the 1840s. As many local young men were stationed overseas, they sang a song from 1849, when many local men left for the California Gold Rush: \\"Star of Peace to Wanderers Weary.\\" The service was broadcast by radio over the Voice of America as an example of the Four Freedoms.\\"Old Whalers' Church Seeking Steeple Fund\\", The New York Times, January 20, 1952. The interior of the sanctuary is entirely in ornate Greek Revival style. It is spacious, with a capacity to seat 800. The pulpit is framed by a pair of pilasters and a pair of Corinthian columns that rise over 50 feet to a coffered ceiling. Trompe-l'œil behind the pulpit gives the impression of a curved wall. The old-fashioned box pews have Cuban mahogany railings. Many have hand-engraved, 19th-century silver nameplates on the doors, when families \\"bought\\" some boxes. Fluted columns support galleries on each side of the sanctuary. The coffered ceiling is supported from a central beam, eliminating the need for supporting columns. It is edged with egg-and- dart molding. A fence along Union Street is built with Egyptian obelisk-shaped fence posts. It is a modern copy of the original fence, which was removed in the 1880s. The fence was an important part of Lafever's original plan to replicate Solomon's Temple in Egyptian style. The plan of the original Temple had a forecourt. Worshippers would pass two great pillars, named Boaz and Jachin, before passing into the sanctuary. In Lafever's design, the fence marked the \\"forecourt\\", and the doorway is framed by two enormous pylons representing Boaz and Jachin. Steeple The church was originally topped with a steeple 185 feet tall, making it visible to ships rounding Montauk Point about 21 miles away by road. The church was the tallest building on Long Island when it opened. The steeple was designed in three upward tapering sections. At the base was an octagonal Greek revival colonnade in which a bell hung. This was a replica of the 4th century BC Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. Above this was a section with four panels, each with Greek key and rosette motifs, which contained clockworks made by Ephriam Byram, Sag Harbor's clockmaker. The clock was removed in 1845 since the area's high winds, which powered the town's many windmills, caused vibrations that made the clock run inaccurately. The slender top spire supported a weather vane. In the late 1800s, George Sterling and his best friend Roosevelt Johnson climbed to the top of the steeple one Saturday night and nailed a homemade pirate's flag to the top. Churchgoers were shocked to see it Sunday morning, and tried to identify the perpetrators, but could not. The flag flew for a week before a professional steeplejack was hired to remove it.Benediktsson, Thomas E. (1980). _George Sterling_ , Twayne Publishers, Boston, p. 15. The steeple was destroyed during the Great Hurricane of 1938. Fundraising to replace the steeple began in 1952. In 1997 a proposal was floated to raise the necessary funds by installing a cell-phone transmission tower inside the new steeple, to be paid for by the cell phone company.Vincent, Stuart (July 26, 1997). \\"History in the Remaking / This time Sag Harbor's Old Whaler's Church will do more than reach for the sky - it will reach out to cell-phone users, too\\", Long Island Newsday In 2000, the cost of restoring the steeple was estimated at $2,000,000. History The first building of the First Presbyterian Church of Sag Harbor was erected in 1766. Known as the \\"Old Barn Church\\", it was a \\"simple building of uncouth shape,\\" a wood-frame building with walls and a roof, but neither a ceiling nor interior plastered walls. According to the Rev. Nathaniel S. Prime, pastor from 1806-09, \\"If a shower of rain occurred during public worship, the minister was obliged to retreat to the corner of the ample pulpit to escape the falling drops.\\" Marker at 43 Church st, Sag harbor - for the Old Barn Church, called the AtheneumThe \\"Old Barn Church\\" was torn down and a second church built in 1816, using lumber recycled from the old building. When the 1816 building became too small, as the congregation expanded through the Second Great Awakening, the present building was built in 1844. The plot of land cost $2,000 and the congregation spent $17,000 on the building, before it was furnished. The church was named a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1994. The congregation hopes someday to reconstruct the steeple. The 1816 building was sold for other uses. Known as \\"the Atheneum,\\" it was used as a community lecture hall and theater. It burned down on April 30, 1924. Restoration In 1950 when the ceiling was found to be unsafe, the church had to be closed for many months. It was reopened in July 1952 after thorough repairs.\\"Old Church Rededicated; Sag Harbor's Historic Whalers Reopened After Repairs\\", The New York Times, July 23, 1951. The \\"modern\\" electric lighting fixtures were removed and replaced with a chandelier and sidelights designed to look like the church's original whale-oil burning fixtures.\\"Whaler's Church To Reopen Doors; Ceiling is Reinforced, Whale Oil Type Lights Installed for Sag Harbor Ceremony\\", The New York Times, July 15, 1951. Another restoration, beginning in the 1990s, received state funding because of the building's historic significance.Vincent, Stuart (August 19, 1997). \\"Albany Helps Whalers' Church\\", The New York Times. During this period the church documented that Minard Lafever had designed the 19th-century building. A letter was found, written by a young cabinetmaker working on the building in 1843, who named Lafever as the architect. This confirmation aided in gaining financial support for the church's restoration, based on its architectural significance. Given documentation of the architect, and with other restoration money for structural repairs, church administrators believed they would be able to raise funds to restore the steeple.

When two or more hosts have to be connected with one another over the IEEE 802.11 protocol and the distance is too long for a direct connection to be established, a wireless repeater is used to bridge the gap. It can be a specialized stand-alone computer networking device. Also, some wireless network interface controllers (WNIC)s optionally support operating in such a mode. Those outsides of the primary network will be able to connect through the new \\"repeated\\" network. However, as far as the original router or access point is concerned, only the repeater MAC is connected, making it necessary to enable safety features on the wireless repeater. Wireless repeaters are commonly used to improve signal range and strength within homes and small offices. Uses *When there is no wireless hotspot in an area *In an area with much interference. *Interference can be caused by many environmental factors such as microwaves (such as from a microwave oven), metal appliances or metallic coating or an impeded line of sight. *When the distance between the computer and the wireless access point or wireless router is too great for the internal wireless network interface card to receive the wireless signal. *When networking in an environment with interference and multiple computers, networks or hubs Drawbacks Since only one wireless device can transmit at once, wireless transmissions are doubled (router to the repeater and then repeater to the client versus just router to the client), and so: * Wireless throughput is reduced by at least 50%. * Wireless interference (e.g., with other networks on the same channel) is at least doubled. * Potentially opens another security attack vector. Older devices don't always support WPA2-PSK so while the original network might be secure, the secondary one is potentially open. Connectivity Some wireless range extending devices connect via a USB port. These USB adapters add Wi-Fi capability to desktop PCs and other devices that have standard USB ports. USB supports not only the data transfers required for networking, but it also supplies a power source so that these adapters do not require electrical plugs. Some wireless repeaters have a power outlet. With those repeaters, you can still use your wall socket while using the repeater. The latest wifi range extenders have an ethernet port to convert your wifi connection into a wired connection. Compatibility There are wireless range extending devices that conform to all 802.11 protocols. Most 802.11 compliant devices are backward compatible. However, 802.11ac runs at 5 GHz and requires an access point capable of 5 GHz operation. 802.11ac is the most recent and third-generation Wi-Fi standard for wireless home networking. 802.11ac equipment is backward compatible with 802.11n, 802.11g, or 802.11b equipment. An older range extender will not be able to repeat the signal of a newer generation router. Security encryption compatibility also matters and must be at the same level of compatibility for the signal to be extended. For example, an older range extender that supports WEP and WPA will not be able to boost a WPA2-encrypted signal from a router.  Alternatives  Most wireless repeaters (or range extenders) are purpose-built, but certain wireless routers can be flashed with custom firmware such as DD-WRT to give them a 'range extender' option. A better option for extending wireless coverage is to configure a secondary box as a wireless access point, with a wired connection between a LAN port on this secondary box and a LAN port on the primary box (a router). If Ethernet wiring is not an option, an alternative is powerline networking. Wireless extender kits consisting of a powerline adapter module (connected to the wireless router) and a wireless extender module (integrated powerline networking and wireless access point) are available.

He was one of the most colorful and controversial characters in Irish football. Early life In 1949, when he was five, his brother Joe brought him to see Shelbourne at their former ground in Milltown. At the time his father Andrew was chairman and controlling shareholder of Shelbourne. He was chairman from 1945 to 1956. Ollie attended St. Josephs BNS Primary School in Terenure. While studying for a degree in Law in UCD, he played for UCD AFC but his asthma ruled soccer out as a career choice. He left college to work in the music industry, promoting new acts, such as Thin Lizzy and Skid Row and had a club, Zeros, on Mary Street. However, he soon returned to football and became involved in the workings of Shelbourne F.C., the club he supported since he was a boy. 1977–1986 Byrne was inducted on to the Shels board in 1976. Tony Byrne took over the club in 1982 and it wasn't until 1986 that Ollie assumed control again. An always controversial figure in 1976 Byrne left his stand seat in Tolka Park and smacked a referee who'd displeased him. The Football Association of Ireland suspended him for that for five years. In January 1984, he sued Shelbourne Football Club Ltd for £21,000 Byrne had claimed he loaned the club. The following month Byrne was awarded £10,000 by the High Court. In May 1986, Byrne sued the Evening Herald and the Evening Press for libel when the papers falsely accused Byrne and a co accused of firearms offenses. In court, Byrne and a co accused were convicted of receiving stolen cigarettes and had been sentenced to three years at Shelton Abbey Prison. They were each awarded £2000. 2001 In September, he was involved in an incident with Derry City F.C. fans over a banner about former player Peter Hutton. When the clubs played again in November the game was held up 35 minutes as Byrne argued over a clash of shirts. 2002 The Paul Marney affair saw Byrne and his club in the High Court when the players' \\"improper\\" registration for St. Patrick's Athletic ended in a court case which left the Inchicore club docked 15 points for further irregularities. Byrne found himself back in court for a different matter when he was fined €100 for running a teenage disco in Tolka Park without a license. 2003 In March, Byrne was charged with public order offences after confronting St Patrick's Athletic fans. 2005 In May, Byrne wrongly accused Shamrock Rovers fans of orchestrating trouble at the 2005 Setanta Sports Cup Final In June, he got involved in a fight with Roddy Collins. In August, Byrne got involved in an altercation with the Drogheda United photographer. 2006 In November, a charge of assault against Byrne was struck out after Collins accepted his apology in court. Death Byrne was hospitalized in January 2007 for severe chest and head pains. He was hospitalized again in June 2007, which caused him to take a leave of absence as Chairman of Shelboune F.C., and died in August at age 63 from cancer.

It was the caput of the feudal barony of Trematon. It is similar in style to the later Restormel Castle, with a 12th-century keep. Trematon Castle overlooks Plymouth Sound and was built probably by Robert, Count of Mortain on the ruins of an earlier Roman fort: it is a motte-and-bailey castle and dates from soon after the Norman conquest. It occupies a sentinel position one and a half miles south-east of Trematon village (). Description Trematon Castle, like Restormel Castle, has a stone keep raised on an earlier motte. Although in ruins, much of the Norman walls remain standing, so that the original form of the Castle and keep are clear. The keep is oval and has walls 10 feet thick and 30 feet high.'Tenant Sought for Trematon Castle' in The Times dated March 1st, 1961, Issue 55018, p. 7, col. F The internal diameter is approximately 21 metres. A rectangular gatehouse, built in 1270, has two floors and a portcullis. Both are in good condition. The military historian Sir Charles Oman said of the castle's situation \\"Trematon is high aloft, on one of the summits of the rather chaotic group of hill-tops which lie behind Saltash and its daring modern bridge.\\"Oman, Sir Charles William Chadwick (1926) Castles, p. 107 Within the castle courtyard stands a Georgian house built in about 1808. This has four reception rooms and six main bedrooms, as well as servants' quarters. Part of the original castle wall was demolished to give this house a view into the surrounding countryside. History The castle was established here by Robert, Count of Mortain soon after the Norman Conquest. From the Conquest until 1270, the rights for the ferry from Saltash Passage on the Plymouth side of the River Tamar to Saltash belonged to the Valletort family. When Roger de Valletort sold Trematon Castle and manor to Richard Earl of Cornwall, the rent was paid to the Earl's bailiff. In the thirteenth century, this amounted to nearly seven pounds sterling. The Castle has remained the property of the Earls and Dukes of Cornwall without interruption since 1270, when Earl Richard bought it for £300. When Sir Francis Drake returned from his circumnavigation voyage in 1580, he came into harbour in Plymouth, then slipped out to anchor behind St Nicholas Island until word came from Queen Elizabeth's Court for the treasures he had gathered to be stored in Trematon Castle.Rowse, A. L. (1939) \\"History on the Hoe\\" in The Times dated November 11, 1939, p. 7. col. G The hoard consisted of gold, silver, and precious stones, mainly emeralds, the result of piracy from Spanish ships along the west coast of South America. Before being moved for storage in the Tower of London, the treasure was temporarily stored in the Golden Hinde. In 1961 the Duchy of Cornwall advertised the Castle to be let on a full repairing lease for 21 years, with breaks, at a rent of £250 a year. It subsequently became the home in Cornwall of Hugh Foot, Lord Caradon, and his son Paul Foot, a campaigning journalist, spent some of his youth there.Paul Foot obituary from Daily Telegraph newspaper Queen Elizabeth II visited the Castle on 25 July 1962 accompanied by the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall, Sir Edward Bolitho, before driving to Fowey and embarking in the royal yacht Britannia.'Court Circular: H.

Playing career Son of Robert who played for Shelbourne, O'Neill made his League of Ireland debut for Shamrock Rovers at Milltown on Sunday the 28th of December 1975 in a 1–0 win over Cork Hibernians. In his second season under Sean Thomas he won his first medal, the FAI League Cup. After the departure of Thomas, Johnny Giles took over as manager at the start of the 1977–78 season. He played for the Republic of Ireland national football team amateur team that qualified and reached the semi finals of the 1978 UEFA Amateur Cup. On 8 March 1978 at Dalymount Park O'Neill played in the first ever Republic of Ireland U21 game and went on to win 2 caps in total. He also won an amateur cap and was called up 8 times for the Republic of Ireland side. O'Neill picked up his second medal when Rovers ended a nine-year barren spell in the FAI Cup with their 21st triumph in 1978. O'Neill saved a penalty in the 1982 FAI League Cup final but The Hoops lost 1–0 to Athlone Town. His first taste of European competition didn't come until 1982 where, like his league debut, he kept a clean sheet on his European bow. Playing in the 1982-83 UEFA Cup games made up for the disappointment of missing out on the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup games four years previously through serious injury picked up on a pre season tour of Spain in August 1978. He represented the League of Ireland XI representative side twice in 1979 and 1980 and was called into the Republic of Ireland national football team as cover in October 1979. Jim McLaughlin was appointed Rovers manager in June 1983 but due to a misunderstanding that developed between them O'Neill signed for UCD. This came as a huge shock to Rovers fans and he got a tremendous reception when Rovers played UCD in the FAI Cup Final in 1984. UCD won the Cup after a replay and O'Neill was Man of the Match in both games despite being hampered by an ankle injury. He kept another clean sheet when UCD played Everton in the 1984–85 European Cup Winners' Cup that autumn, a trophy the English club went on to win. In June 1985 he signed for Dundalk F.C. In eight seasons he won all domestic honours. He was everpresent for 4 seasons from 1987 to 1991 and kept 105 clean sheets in 233 league games making a total of 327 appearances. In a 1987–88 European Cup Winners' Cup game against defending holders AFC Ajax he saved a penalty from Ronald Spelbos. O'Neill signed back for Rovers in the summer of 1993 and subsequently won another League title that season under Ray Treacy keeping fifteen clean sheets in thirty two games. O'Neill kept his 200th clean sheet in a 1–0 win over Sligo in the RDS Arena in September 1994. He made his 500th League of Ireland appearance at Galway United in September 1995 in a season where he ended up with the Player of the Year award.Shamrock Rovers FC#Player of the Year Award recipients In total he played 6 times in European competition for the Hoops keeping 2 clean sheets and is the only Rovers player to ever win all three domestic trophies the League of Ireland, the FAI Cup and the League of Ireland Cup. O'Neill kept 54 clean sheets in his first spell at the Hoops and 34 in his second spell. Management career After Treacy was sacked in January 1996 O'Neill, along with Terry Eviston, was appointed manager. After losing the first game of the 1996/97 the Rovers faithful were stunned when O'Neill and Terry were sacked. O'Neill then signed for Sligo Rovers F.C keeping a clean sheet on his debut on 5 October 1996. His final League of Ireland game was at Finn Park in April 1997. O'Neill stepped in to manage Rovers for the playoff games with Dublin City at the end of the 2005 season.http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish/2005/1126/198626-shamrockrovers.html In 2006 O'Neill became a Shamrock Rovers legend. He is the only Rovers player to ever win all three domestic trophies the League of Ireland, the FAI Cup and the League of Ireland Cup. He is now the goalkeeping coach for the Republic of Ireland under-21 national football team. O'Neill has four children. His younger brother Dermot O'Neill (footballer) also played in the League of Ireland as a goalkeeper.

It is located approximately south of Prince Frederick, the county seat. As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 405. Although Broomes Island is a rather small community, it does have its own post office and zip code, 20615. In November 2007, the United States Postal Service considered closing the small post office and re- routing all mail delivery through the larger St. Leonard post office branch. After residents contacted US Senator Barbara Mikulski about the proposed closure, the postal service decided against closing the post office. Broomes Island is located near the mouth of St. Leonard Creek, the largest tributary of the Patuxent River entirely inside Calvert County. It is in the vicinity of Broomes Island that several key naval battles were fought during the War of 1812. During the early and mid-20th century, Broomes Island had a substantial oyster canning industry. In recent years most residents of Broomes Island commute to other places for work. Each May, former Maryland State Senator Bernie Fowler has held a \\"wade-in\\" at Broomes Island, where he and others would walk into the waters of the Patuxent River until their feet were no longer visible. This was held on the property of Mr. Donald Rogers with his permission. Fowler started the annual tradition to bring awareness to the water clarity levels of the Patuxent. In recent years, the \\"wade-in\\" has become a noteworthy public event, with numerous public officials joining Fowler in the walk, including Maryland Governors Martin O'Malley and Robert Ehrlich and U.S Senator Barbara Mikulski. It no longer takes place at this location. In 2003, Hurricane Isabel caused moderate damage to numerous structures in Broomes Island. Most notably, the last remains of the considerable Broomes Island oyster industry - a large red oyster shucking barn - succumbed. The site of the oyster shucking barn is now part of the local Stoney's sea food restaurant. The site is now a venue for weddings and other functions.

There may be limits on the amount that is allowed free of charge, and hard limits on the amount that is allowed. The limits vary per airline and depend on the class, elite status, type of ticket, flight origin and destination. If a flight is booked together with another flight it may also have different limits (e.g. if another flight on the same ticket is a long-haul flight). The exact baggage conditions are mentioned in the ticket information online. Types of baggage On aircraft, there are two types of baggage, which are treated differently: checked baggage and hand/carry-on luggage. For both types, transportation companies have rules on the weight and size. For checked baggage, stored in the aircraft hold, usually the weight is the limiting factor. All checked items are generally weighed by the airline during check- in, and if they exceed the limit, the passenger is informed by the airline. To avoid any fees, the passenger often must switch some of the items found in the suitcase to another suitcase, or else carry it on. Carry-on luggage is judged primarily by size. Bags are measured by dimension or in total linear measurement (length + width + height). However, there may also be other restrictions on the types of belongings that can be carried on the plane. IATA The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released recommendations for limits on checked baggage and carry-on luggage. Some companies adhere to these recommendations, some adhere partially and some don't adhere at all to them. The recommendations for checked baggage are: advised maximum weight 23 kg (50.71 lbs), weight limit 32 kg (70.55 lbs), advised maximum size 158 cm (62.2 in) length + width + height, limit 203 cm (nearly 80 in). The limit of 23 kg is present because of similar limits in health and safety regulations. Because of the wide variation in hand/carry-on luggage limits, in 2015 IATA released a size recommendation for suitcases meant as hand/carry-on luggage. These state that suitcases should have a maximum size of 55 cm (21.65 in) long, 35 cm (13.78 in) wide and 20 cm (7.87 in) deep. If they meet these requirements, the bag may carry the logo \\"IATA cabin OK\\". This limit is tighter than most current airline limits, so bags with this logo are practically allowed everywhere. Standard concepts Two concepts for baggage weight limits are in use. Piece Concept The Piece Concept used to be applicable only for passengers travelling to or from the Americas. From the 1st August 2019, however, Vietnam Airlines (IATA Area 3) adopted the Piece Concept. Under the Piece Concept, passengers are permitted to check in a certain number of suitcases with a per-bag weight of up to 23 kilograms for Economy Class, and up to 32 kilograms for Business or First Class. The allowed weight per suitcase and the number of suitcases varies per airline and depends on the class, elite status, type of ticket, flight origin and destination. this is wixkid Weight Concept Under the Weight Concept, each passenger is permitted to check in a total weight regardless of the number of suitcases. Often passengers traveling together can also combine their allowed weights. The total weight varies per airline and depends on the class, elite status, type of ticket, flight origin and destination. Fees Baggage fees in the United States have been the norm for many airlines and the trend is predicted to continue with many trans-Atlantic flights starting to collect fees for the lowest cost tickets. IdeaWorks, a travel consulting firm, predicted fees will become the norm by the end of 2019 and globally thereafter. The 23 largest airlines in the United States reported earning $4.6 billion in baggage fees in 2017.

(1991). Remarks on the observations on the feeling of the beautiful and sublime. (J.T. Goldthwait, Trans.). Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. (Original work published 1764). Rational thinking and decision-making does not leave much room for emotions.Livet, P. (2010). Rational choice, neuroeconomy and mixed emotions. Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society B, 265, 259-269. In fact, emotions are often considered irrational occurrences that may distort reasoning.Barnes, A. and P. Thagard. 1996. Emotional decisions. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society pp. 426–429. However, there are presently theories and research for both rational decision-making and emotional decision-making focusing on the important role of emotions in decision-making and the mental process and logic on the important role in rational decision-making. Loewenstein and Lerner divide emotions during decision-making into two types: those anticipating future emotions and those immediately experienced while deliberating and deciding. Damasio formulated the somatic marker hypothesis (SMH), that proposes a mechanism by which emotional processes can guide (or bias) behavior, particularly decision-making. Pfister and Böhm believe that \\"the issue of rationality should be based on the validity of emotional evaluations rather than on formal coherence.\\" The Loewenstein-Lerner classification Anticipated emotions Loewenstein and Lerner divide emotions during decision-making into two types: those anticipating future emotions and those immediately experienced while deliberating and deciding. Anticipated (or expected) emotions are not experienced directly, but are expectations of how the person will feel once gains or losses associated with that decision are experienced.Lowenstein, G., & Lerner, J.S. (2003). The role of affect in decision making. In R. Davidson, K. Scherer, & H. Goldsmith (Eds.), Handbook of affective science, pp. 619-642. New York: Oxford University Press. A great deal of research has focused on the risk/return spectrum that is considered in most decisions. For example, students may anticipate regret when deciding which section of a class is best to register for,Zeelenberg, M., van Dijk, W.W., & Manstead, A.S.R. (1998). Reconsidering the relation between regret and responsibility. Organizational behavior and human decision processes, 74(3), 254-272. or participants in a weight-loss plan might anticipate the pleasure they will feel if they lose weight, versus the negative feelings unsuccessful efforts may engender.Mellers, B.A., & McGraw, A.P. (2001). Anticipated emotions as guides to choice. Current directions in psychological science, 10(6). 210-214. Generally, it is the contemplation of incremental losses or gains that generates anticipated emotions in decision-makers, as opposed to their overall condition. This means that an investor who imagines losing a small amount of money will generally focus with disappointment on the lost investment, rather than with pleasure on the overall amount still owned. Similarly, a dieter who anticipates losing two pounds may imagine feeling pleasure even though those two pounds are a very small percentage of what needs to be lost overall. Also, decision-makers tend to compare a possible result of a decision against what could have happened, rather than to their current state: for instance, game participants who could win $1000 and end up with nothing base their disappointment on the loss of the hoped-for prize, rather than on the fact that they have no less money than they had when they began the game. This process, and the anticipation of such emotion, is referred to as a counterfactual comparison. Finally, decision- makers tend to weight possible outcomes differently based on the amount of delay between the choice and the outcome. Decisions made with a time delay – intertemporal choice – tend to involve different weights on outcomes depending on their delay, involving hyperbolic discounting and affective forecasting. These effects are then connected to anticipated emotions as the decision is being contemplated. Immediate emotions True emotions experienced while decision-making are termed immediate emotions, integrating cognition with somatic or bodily experienced components within the autonomic nervous system and outward emotional expressions. These may or may not be connected to the decision at hand, however; while contemplation of the decision’s consequences may give rise to immediate emotions, known as anticipatory or integral influences, immediate emotions can also be related to the current environment or the dispositional affect of the person. Although unrelated to the decision under consideration, this type of emotion can still impact the decision-making process as an incidental influence.Han, S., & Lerner, J.S. (2009). Decision making. In D. Sander and K.R. Scherer (Eds.), Oxford companion to emotion and the affective sciences, pp. 111-113. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Immediate emotions tend to operate differently from anticipated emotions. First, when they are intense they tend to negate the probability of the possible outcome; for example, a fear of flying experienced while deciding how to travel may lead a person to choose driving even though air safety statistics would show air travel to be statistically less likely to present a danger. The intense emotions can exact a higher influence on the decision than the probabilities under consideration. Also, immediate emotions can be very sensitive to how vivid the possible outcome is to the decision-maker. Again, a fear of flying may be enhanced by the vividness of the mental image of a plane crash may be in the mind of the decision-maker. Finally, how soon an outcome may happen impacts the related immediate emotions: the sooner the impending possible outcome, the more intense the emotion associated with that event. Overall, these emotions are real, experienced emotions, as opposed to those anticipated while thinking about possible outcomes, and as such can very powerfully impact decision-making.Keltner, D., & Lerner, J.S. (2010). Emotion. In S.T. Fiske, D.T. Gilbert, & G. Lindzey (Eds.), Handbook of social psychology, pp. 317-352. Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis The somatic marker hypothesis (SMH), formulated by Antonio Damasio, proposes a mechanism by which emotional processes can guide (or bias) behavior, particularly decision-making.Damasio, A.R. (1994). Descartes' Error: emotion, reason, and the human brain. New York: Grosset/Putnam.Damasio, A.R., Tranel, D. & Damasio, H. (1991). \\"Somatic markers and the guidance of behaviour: theory and preliminary testing\\" (pp. 217–229). In H.S. Levin, H.M. Eisenberg & A.L. Benton (Eds.). Frontal lobe function and dysfunction. New York: Oxford University Press Emotions, as defined by Damasio, are changes in both body and brain states in response to different stimuli. Physiological changes (e.g., muscle tone, heart rate, endocrine release, posture, facial expression, etc.) occur in the body and are relayed to the brain where they are transformed into an emotion that tells the individual something about the stimulus that they have encountered. Over time, emotions and their corresponding bodily change(s) become associated with particular situations and their past outcomes. When making decisions, these physiological signals (or ‘somatic markers’) and their evoked emotion are consciously or unconsciously associated with their past outcomes and bias decision-making towards certain behaviors while avoiding others. For instance, when a somatic marker associated with a positive outcome is perceived, the person may feel happy and motivated to pursue that behavior. When a somatic marker associated with the negative outcome is perceived, the person may feel sad and the emotion may act as an internal alarm to warn the individual to avoid a course of action. These situation-specific somatic states based on, and reinforced by, past experiences help to guide behavior in favor of more advantageous choices and therefore are adaptive. According to the SMH, two distinct pathways reactivate somatic marker responses. In the first pathway, emotion can be evoked by the changes in the body that are projected to the brain—called the \\"body loop\\". For instance, encountering a feared object like a snake may initiate the fight-or-flight response and cause fear. In the second pathway, cognitive representations of the emotions can be activated in the brain without being directly elicited by a physiological response—called the \\"as-if body loop\\". For instance, imagining an encounter with a snake would initiate a similar flight-or-fight response \\"as-if\\" you were in that particular situation (albeit perhaps a much weaker one). In other words, the brain can anticipate expected bodily changes, which allows the individual to respond faster to external stimuli without waiting for an event to actually occur. According to Dunn, \\"the somatic marker hypothesis proposes that ‘somatic marker’ biasing signals from the body are represented and regulated in the emotion circuitry of the brain, particularly the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), to help regulate decision-making in situations of complexity and uncertainty\\". Therefore, in situations of complexity and uncertainty, the marker signals allow the brain to recognise the situation and respond quickly.Dunn, B. D. Dalgleish, T. & Lawrence, A. D., 2006. The somatic marker hypothesis: A critical evaluation. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 30, pp. 239–271. Pfister and Böhm's framework Pfister and Böhm (2008) have developed a classification of how emotions function in decision- making that conceptualizes an integral role for emotions, rather than simply influencing decision-making.Pfister, H.R., & Böhm, G. (2008). The multiplicity of emotions: A framework of emotional functions in decision making. Judgment and decision making, 3(1), 5-17. The four roles played by emotions in this framework are: * Providing information: This includes both positive and negative emotions that arise directly from the options being considered by the decision maker, who can then evaluate choices with this \\"information.\\" This role is especially likely when the felt emotion is reducible; that is, easily reduced to a simple comparison (for example, attraction and repulsion), and unequivocally positive or negative. Pleasure and displeasure make up the spectrum of these emotions. * Improving speed: While making a good decision is important, making a quick decision is also important. Therefore, emotions and associated somatic conditions can offer mechanisms for encouraging a decision maker to decide quickly, especially when one or more options are potentially dangerous. Hunger, anger and fear can all induce a speedy decision. * Assessing relevance: Emotions help decision makers decide whether a certain element of the decision is relevant to their particular situations. Each person’s personal history and state(s) of mind leads to a different set of relevant information. The two such emotions most studied to date are regret and disappointment. * Enhancing commitment: In some ways, making the decision best for the self may be construed \\"the best\\" overall. However, acting in the best interests of others is also important in human civilization, and moral sentiments, or emotions, serve to help decision makers commit to such a decision rather than being drawn back toward pure self-interest. Emotions such as guilt and love help decision makers make such commitments. This framework can help in exploring such concepts as ambivalence, tendencies toward particular types of action, and sustaining difficult choices over time. Positive and negative emotions Research done by Isen and Patrick put forth the theory of \\"mood maintenance\\" which states that happy decision-makers are reluctant to gamble. In other words, happy people decide against gambling, since they would not want to undermine the happy feeling.Isen, A. M. & Patrick, R., 1983.The effect of positive feelings on risk taking: When the chips are down. Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 31 (2), pp. 194–202. Alternatively, the influence of negative feelings at the time of decision-making was studied by Raghunathan and Tuan Pham (1999). They conducted three experiments in gambling decisions and job selection decisions, where unhappy subjects were found to prefer high-risk/high-reward options unlike anxious subjects who preferred low-risk/low-reward options. They stated that \\"anxiety and sadness convey distinct types of information to the decision-maker and prime different goals.\\" It was found that \\"while anxiety primes an implicit goal of uncertainty reduction, sadness primes an implicit goal of reward replacement\\".Raghunathan, R. & Tuan Pham, M., 1999. All negative moods are not equal: Motivational influences of anxiety and sadness on decision making. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 79 (1), 56–77. Thus emotions cannot simply be classified as positive or negative as we need to consider the consequences of the emotions in ultimate decision- making.  State-dependent remembering  Another important factor is the memory of events in decision making. The mood someone has works as \\"a retrieval cue\\" whereby happy feelings make positive materials come to mind which in turn have great impact on the decisions that are made. The same is true of negative feelings.Isen, A. M. & Shalker, T. E., 1982. The effect of feeling state on evaluation of positive, neutral, and negative stimuli: When you “accentuate the positive,” do you “eliminate the negative”? Social Psychology Quarterly, 45 (1), 58–63. Bower coined the term state-dependent remembering for this phenomenon.Bower, G. H., 1981. Mood and memory. American Psychologist, 36 (2), pp. 129–148. Bower and others stated that emotions and feelings cannot be extracted from the human mind. The emotions felt in a particular situation will be recorded in the emotional memory and can be activated when the person faces a similar situation or has to make a difficult decision in a short period of time. Often the decision maker is unaware of previous experiences in similar situations.Sayegh, L. Anthony, W. P. & Perrewé, P. L., 2004. Managerial decision-making under crisis: The role of emotion in an intuitive decision process. Human Resource Management Review, 14 (2), 179–199. Impact Much research has been conducted on the various impacts of emotion on decision-making. Studies indicate the complexity and breadth of those impacts. Listed below are some examples of their results. * Decision-makers who were made to consider safety concerns that induced negative emotions when deciding which car to purchase, were more likely to \\"choose not to choose,\\" or to stick with the status quo.Luce, M.F. (1998). Choosing to avoid: Coping with negatively emotion-laden consumer decisions. Journal of consumer research, 24(4) 409-433. * Study participants who experienced \\"frustrated anger\\" were more likely to choose a high risk, high reward option in a lottery – a choice the authors categorize as \\"self- defeating.\\"Leith, K.F., & Baumeister, R.F. (1996). Why do bad moods increase self-defeating behavior? Emotion, risk taking, and self-regulation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71(6), 1250-1267. * \\"Fearful people made pessimistic judgments of future events whereas angry people made optimistic judgements.\\" * Study participants who had been induced to feel sad were likely to set a lower selling price for an item they were asked to sell; the researchers suggest that selling the item would bring about a change in the participants’ circumstances and thus perhaps a positive change in mood.Lerner, J.S., Small, D.A., & Loewenstein, G. (2004). Heart strings and purse strings: carry-over effects of emotions on economic decisions. Psychological science, 15(5), 337-341. * Participants with \\"normal emotion processing\\" were engaged in a card-drawing task. When drawing from \\"dangerous decks\\" and consequently experiencing losses and the associated negative emotions, they subsequently made safer and more lucrative choices. Participants with brain damage that had left them unable to experience such emotional responses, did not change their behavior in this way.Bechara, A.R., Damasio, H., Damasio, A., & Lee, G.P. (1999).

He is one of the founders of the Mimeo Revolution, a literary movement that sprang up concurrently with The Beats. He was instrumental in bringing non-establishment poets and artists such as Charles Bukowski, Robert Crumb and D. A. Levy into the limelight by publishing their work. He published his first book of poetry under the pseudonym (and double entendre) Peter Wellinher. As described in the introduction to James DenBoer's A Bibliography of the Published Works of Douglas Blazek: 1961-2001 (Glass Eye Books, 2003), Blazek is noteworthy for his prolific early period (1964-1978), followed by an extended hiatus. Between 1978 and 2009, Blazek published only one book, but this was also a time of intense creativity, as the poet focused on rewriting all his previously published work. The first book-length results of this labor, Aperture Mirror and Gutting Cats in Search of Fiddles, were published in 2012 by Edition Muta with more titles published in the years following.

Minimalism strives to reduce interference of information delivery with the user's sense- making process. It does not try to eliminate any chance of the user making a mistake, but regards an error as a teachable moment that content can exploit. Like Robert E. Horn's work on information mapping, John Carroll's principles of Minimalism were based in part on cognitive studies and learning research at Harvard and Columbia University, by Jerome Bruner, Jerome Kagan, B.F. Skinner, George A. Miller, and others. Carroll argues that training materials should present short task-oriented chunks, not lengthy, monolithic documentation that tries to explain everything in a long narrative. A historian of technical communication, R. John Brockmann, points out that Fred Bethke and others at IBM enunciated task orientation as a principle a decade earlier in a report on IBM Publishing Guidelines. Carroll observes that modern users are often already familiar with much of what a typical long manual describes. What they need is information to solve a task at hand. He feels that documentation should encourage them to do this with a minimum of systematic instruction. Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is built on Carroll's theories of Minimalism and Horn's theories of Information Mapping. Minimalism is a large part of JoAnn Hackos' recent workshops and books on information development using structured writing and the DITA XML standard. Good writing means that the message is directly clear to the projected audience. Adopting a minimalist method may appear, in the short-term, to cost more, as writers must cut up and rephrase content into single free-standing chunks. However, the longer-term brings cost-saving benefits, particularly in translation and localization, where often sum is on a ‘per word’ basis. But the greatest advantage for companies is user fulfillment. The less time a customer spends working out how to do something, the more likely they are to purchase again.

They are mostly common in role- playing games, though this does not exclude other video game genres, such as some platformers and strategy games. Overworlds generally feature a top-down view or a third-person perspective of the fictional world within the game. It often contains varied terrain (including caves, mountains, forests, and bodies of water) and a collection of towns and other locations (most commonly dungeons or levels). When the party enters one of these locations the world map display may remain on the screen, be replaced by the local geography, or be hidden until the party exits the location. In many games, the player is able to travel on the world map; in other games, the player uses the world map to select their next location. Typically, a dungeon houses a host of enemies, while a town usually is safe. In some games, there are a series of world maps. Some games allow the player to view only a portion of the world map at the beginning of the game, with new locations becoming visible as the game progresses, whereas other games show the entire world map from the beginning. The opposite term \\"underworld\\" refers to the world underneath the ground. Types Role-playing video games Overworld map from the video game The Battle for Wesnoth. The Ultima series of RPGs marks one of the first uses of an overworld. Many games have emulated Ultimas overworlds, especially fantasy- based ones. The most prominent example in this category is the Dragon Quest series. In each of this type of overworld game, most of the action (or at least most of the plot-advancing action) takes place in towns, forests, dungeons, caves, castles (and the surrounding area), camps, fortresses, mass transportation systems, celestial bodies (e.g. the moon), and other locations. In the Dragon Quest series, the overworld is used as a \\"travel map\\", and changes to a closer perspective for direct gameplay or confrontation. The overworlds featured in most of the 2D adventures of this genre commonly depict the character(s)' proportions as larger than they actually would be in the world being travelled, thus lending necessary visibility to the player. The characters' animation in this type of overworld is often simpler than that found in the game's menus and other areas, while more complicated movement such as combat, climbing or visibly handling objects sometimes happens at closer perspectives, and often involves cutscenes. The Legend of Zelda series While previous games have featured overworlds, one of the earliest console games to feature an overworld is the Nintendo Entertainment System game The Legend of Zelda. Gameplay in Zeldas overworld was virtually identical to that of its nine underground dungeon levels, offering a top-down perspective and including access to caves, bridges, mazes, shops and waterfalls as well as lurking dangers that range from enemies to tumbling rocks. Much of the immediate gameplay takes place in the overworld, and the diversity of terrain (as well as the sheer size of the overworld itself) ensures that the player will spend as much time exploring and searching above ground as they will below (or in any of the areas listed above). The concept of an overworld also offered a non-linear gameplay experience; some believed this would cause the player to become confused and not know where to go, a sentiment which has endured as overworlds have become larger and more complex. The Zelda series is well known for these large overworld areas, such as Hyrule Field. Many enemies inhabit the various overworlds. The player can see most of these without any special tools, and most are easily defeated or avoided. The game Minecraft is another popular example of a platform game with an Overworld. There are special items available in most of the overworld areas in the series, but these are often non-essential to completing the overall objective; the main purpose served by an overworld is to connect more important places. Platform games Although large-scale overworlds were popularized by The Legend of Zelda in 1986, the genre of platform games did not have overworlds (in the main sense) until 3D platformers appeared in the mid-1990s. The concept of an overworld in platform gaming prior to that time was limited to a \\"level select\\" style, which first was featured in the multi- genre arcade title Dragon Buster, and popularized by other games such as Bionic Commando and Super Mario Bros. 3. In Spyro the first 3 games had a place called a \\"home world\\" that was like an over world. It contained portals to other levels of the game. Previous titles like Super Mario Bros. and Castlevania revolved around the player completing levels in a linear order, with no option to return to completed levels. It is likely that the overworlds developed for 3D games, such as some of those listed above, evolved from the level-select type overworlds featured in prior 2D platform games, such as those seen in Super Mario Bros. 3 and Donkey Kong Country.PC World – Super Mario Advance 4 (GBA) Test Report Beginning with Super Mario Bros. 3, every Mario platformer has featured either a level-select type overworld (e.g. Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros.) or a hub-type overworld (e.g. Peach's Castle in Super Mario 64 and the Comet Observatory in Super Mario Galaxy) – a central, usually enemy-free area – that connects to levels and other important places. As the genre evolved and became more popular, the overworld concept expanded into other platformers – from Kirby's Adventure to the Donkey Kong series – becoming a staple of the genre that endures as a prominent feature. Minecraft Minecraft is an extremely popular platform and sandbox video game. This game's overworld is a default, meaning the player is situated in the overworld by default, unless the game is modified. Minecraft's overworld is one of the most popular overworld maps. Home level The town level in the roguelike game Angband. A home level is an area found within a roguelike video game. It is usually a haven for the hero characters, where enemy hostility is minimal. In most cases, the home level features shops in which the player can purchase items, and is often the initial site of the story or game, although in some games it is a location discovered later. In some games, such as Destiny of an Emperor, as the story progresses, the location of the home level may change, or there may be other such places that serve a similar purpose. Larn, a 1980s roguelike game, was among the earliest to feature a home level. Some games feature a home level that contains many different points of interest. The home level in Angband, for instance, consists of seven shops, the player's home (where characters may store unneeded items), and a staircase to the first dungeon level. Some variants of the home level add speciality shops, quest locations, or a wilderness through which additional towns can be discovered. Navigation Many of the games that have an overworld feature a world map of some sort; these range from very basic – such as a grey rectangle with a dot indicating the position of the character in The Legend of Zelda – to an overworld map that can be toggled on and off, but shows only rough outlines of various locations, as well as the character's ever-changing location, such as in later instalments in the Zelda series, or many Final Fantasy games. Other games, including several instalments in the Ultima and Wasteland series, include detailed, often colourful maps on cloth or paper that came bundled with the game and is meant to be used to navigate while playing the game. Games like Miracle Warriors even came with a little action figure in metal meant to be placed on your position. Whatever the map style employed (if any), varied world map terrain such as mountains, rivers and deserts may prevent the character(s) from visiting an area until they have completed a certain task or acquired a special skill, vehicle or other key item. Many CRPGs eventually allow the player rapid movement around the overworld, using such methods as flying, sailing, or teleporting to various locations. The map icon is often represented as a rectangle. Usually, flying or sailing across one edge of the map will bring the character(s) to the edge of the opposite side. In some games, certain areas of the overworld map are hidden from the player, or at least difficult to reach; these \\"secret\\" areas often contain difficult-to-obtain items, or they might simply hold \\"Easter Egg\\"-style novelties or other such diversions. In some games, especially those that have a \\"level select\\" style of overworld (e.g. a lot of old-school 2D platform games), portions of the overworld become available for play as certain tasks are completed (e.g. beating a particular level or discovering a secret hidden within a level). Audio design In terms of video game music, overworld themes are often orchestral in nature, and of greater length and complexity than other pieces in the same game, due to the amount of time spent travelling the overworld map. Because players will usually visit a single level or area a few times in a given play session, the music for any such section of the game will typically be shorter and/or less complex,\\"The Evolution of Video Game Music\\", All Things Considered, July 28, 2008. and thus less time-consuming for the designers to produce. The overworld theme frequently functions as a main theme of a game, often used as a motif for other tracks (e.g., a \\"romance\\" theme features the main melody of overworld theme, orchestrated in a different key).Early Video Game Soundtracks 2001 article on video game music, orig.

For example, while multiple attorneys may belong to a chapter, each must be of a different specialty (ie. criminal defense, business litigation, contract law, marital & family law), so as not to create undue competition for referrals. If a business wants to have multiple representatives, they are free to do so, provided each representative from the business belongs to a different chapter, and they pay separate dues for each representative. Many meetings take place in hotel conference rooms, restaurants, and other locations that allow groups to meet. They also take place during breakfast or lunch hours, and while not mandatory per se, chapter leadership often requires members to pay a separate quarterly fee to cover the costs of using the venue, which frequently includes meals, refreshments, electricity, tables, and AV equipment for presentations. In general, chapter meetings follow the same basic structure. Once the meeting is called to order by the Chapter President, initial announcements are presented by leadership, an educational piece is usually presented on how to improve networking and referral skills. Members from bigger groups are given 30 seconds whereas members from smaller groups are given 60 seconds to present a weekly commercial for their business, in which they request referrals or otherwise discuss what sort of business they are looking for. Guests and prospective members are then encouraged to tell the chapter about their business and what they do to provide value to the chapter. Frequently, chapters will either vote on the best commercial given that week, or permit the previous week's winner to make the selection. Then one member each week gives a 10 minute presentation, which is a more in-depth version of the commercials, going into detail as to what services their business performs or what products they offer, their education, training & experience, and specific referrals they are looking for to help grow their business. During the commercials and presentations, a binder filled with the business cards of current members is passed around, permitting current members to take cards and pass them to potential clients, and for guests & visitors to take as well. Only inducted members are permitted to place cards in the binder. BNI also provides training to its members. Once the presentation is completed, each member is then given a chance to pass out referrals, testimonials to other members of the chapter, and \\"Thank You For Closed Business\\", in which a previously passed referral is concluded and has generated revenue for their business. These can be done either online via the BNI Connect app, the BNI website, or in person at the meeting. These are recorded to keep track of how many referrals are passed, and how much business the chapter has generated for its members throughout the year. Visitors that wish to join are permitted to attend up to two meetings, after which they are required to submit a membership application if they wish to attend further meetings. Once they become a member, they are permitted up to three absences in a rolling six- month period. If a member obtains 4 or more absences during that time period, they are removed from the group, and the profession/category becomes open for new members to fill. Members are permitted to send a substitute to the meeting if they know ahead of time they will be unable to attend, which does not count against their absences. In addition, if a member falls ill and cannot attend for medical reasons, they are given a medical absence, which also does not count towards their overall absences. Membership is renewed annually, on the anniversary month of when a member joined, and dues are to be paid when they submit their renewal application. There are different Chapter Director Consultants in each area that assist new startup chapters. In 2020, during the Covid-19, BNI launched a new brand \\"BNI Online\\", facilitating the business networking using new technology, with a new revamped online agenda. Meetings are arranged online via Zoom.

McCourt is most notable for his death as a result of an on-ice brawl in which he was struck in the head by several sticks. McCourt was a developing scorer in his brief career. Death from on-ice injuries On March 6, 1907, McCourt was playing for the Cornwall Hockey Club against the Ottawa Victorias in a replay of a match on February 15 protested by Ottawa because McCourt and one other player had played for the Montreal Shamrocks of a rival league. McCourt's eligibility, protested by Ottawa, had been established before the game. Early in the second half of the match, a brawl broke out between the teams during which McCourt suffered from a head injury. He was taken from the ice unconscious, and died the following morning. Aftermath An inquest was held that same day at which the following verdict was rendered: > That Owen McCourt came to his death by a blow from a hockey stick in the > hands of Charles Masson during the progress of a game of hockey played in > the Victoria rink in the town of Cornwall March 6th, 1907. And, that in the > opinion of this jury, although there is no evidence of ill feeling previous > to the assault, there was no justification by personal provocation for the > blow at the hands of the said Charles Masson. After hearing the evidence, > your jury further recommends that legislation be enacted whereby players or > spectators encouraging or engaging in rough or foul play may be severely > punished. Trail of the Stanley Cup, Vol I., Charles L. Coleman, Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company, 1964, In the second known trial (after the 1905 trial of Allan Loney) stemming from an in-game ice hockey incident, Masson was arraigned on a charge of manslaughter (reduced from a murder charge over the objection of the Crown prosecutor) on April 10, 1907. Several witnesses attested that McCourt had been struck by another, unknown player before Masson's blow, and Masson was subsequently acquitted. In the aftermath of the incident, Cornwall withdrew from the league, and the Victorias (one of the two remaining teams in the loop after the withdrawals of the second-place Cornwall team and the first-place Montagnards) were named champions. As champions of the league, Ottawa challenged for the Stanley Cup, which was accepted by the trustees, and played a year later against the Montreal Wanderers in January, 1908. The referee of the match in which McCourt died, Emmett Quinn, later became president of the National Hockey Association (NHA). It is commonly thought that McCourt was the first player in North American hockey to die as a result of on-ice violence, but that is erroneous; Alcide Laurin was, in an incident in 1905.The Killing of Alcide Laurin in a Hockey Match at Maxville The Ottawa Journal, page 1, February 27, 1905 Playing career McCourt played his entire, brief career with Cornwall Hockey Club of the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL) – save for a two-game stint with the Montreal Shamrocks of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association in 1907 – and blossomed into stardom in his final two seasons. He led Cornwall with five goals in the 1906 season, and went on in 1907 to score sixteen goals in eight games to lead the league, including seven against Morrisburg on February 22. Career stats He scored a total of 26 goals in 23 senior matches.

The company was founded in 1984 by Rona and Arthur Wolstenholme, based in Peterborough. The company design and manufacture sports and racing cars for both road legal and track day use with unique designs from open wheel racing cars to modern day sports cars. The W152 was the first car to be designed and produced by Ronart Cars. Wolstenholme initially had the idea in 1981 but the design and build of a prototype car began in 1984 and the car launched at the 1985 International Classic Car Show. Production started in early 1987. The Mk2 version of the Ronart W152 started production in 1996 which has continued until the present day. A departure into more mainstream cars came in 1999 where the company took on new joint ownership and designed and built the carbon fibre Ronart Lightning V8, which they launched at the 1999 London Motor Show. More than twenty four direct orders were taken at the show stand on its debut. Only a limited number of cars however were built before production ceased in 2003 after the new owners closed the business following a switch of investment into another car manufacturer. In 2004, Wolstenholme, licensed the Vanwall brand and over the following ten years created and manufactured three new Vanwall car designs, the Grand Prix Racer, the Vanwall 2S and the replica Vanwall 58. In 2006 Iain Sanderson joined Arthur Wolstenholme with Vanwall in the production of Vanwall cars and the W152. During which time they also started the Lightning Car Company specifically to create and develop a new car called the Lightning GT. This was an ultra modern technology, electric sports car with a design style based upon the original Lightning V8. The Lightning GT was launched at the 2008 International London Motor Show. The W152 was manufactured under licence by Vanwall for ten years, from 2004 until the factory closed in early 2014. Since then manufacturing has continued by Ronart. The Ronart W152 is currently being produced from Ronart Cars, Peterborough. Models W152 Ronart W152 The W152 was the first car to be designed and produced by Ronart Cars. Design began in 1981 and production started in 1986. The W152's style is based on that of the front-engined Formula 1 cars of the 1940s and 1950s. The external exhaust system and \\"hump style\\" headrest are key design features of a car from that era. The W152 design however is not a copy but an original design with a reflection of many styles of cars from that era. The MK1 chassis was originally designed by Spyder Engineering, who had made chassis for Lotus in the past. Like many Lotus cars, the W152 uses a backbone chassis. So, the chassis narrows in the centre, at the transmission tunnel and spreads out to all 4 corners. The MK 2 cars, produced since 1996 featured the chassis redesigned and built in-house. The chassis is normally powder coated or enameled in black. The body comprises 11 sections/panels, the centre tub section, nose cone, bonnet, front side panels, rear section, boot lid and all four wings. The centre section is reinforced with a steel cage for safety and rigidity. There is also a roll- over hoop welded into the section which is hidden under the head rest. This section attaches to the chassis by mounting point at the rear of the cage and also at the front in the footwells. The cage also holds the seat belt mounting points. The nose cone houses the grill and is in the style of 50s and 60s racing cars. The side panels can have either nothing, 3 mesh covered holes or a large exhaust hole at the top. An S6 models would usually have 3 mesh covered holes on the intake side and a large exhaust hole on the other side. A V12 model would usually have the three mesh holes on both sides and also an exhaust hole just underneath that. Some owners have opted for mixed options, mainly because of different exhaust systems. Most earlier models also had louvers near the bottom of each side panel. The side repeaters are also positioned on the side panels. The bonnet has a large, central scoop and, on most S6 models, a bump above where the intake sits as the carburetors need clearance and would contact the bonnet otherwise. The rear section consists of the head fairing, and fuel filler cap. On later cars (Mk.II specifically), there is also a boot in the rear section. The wings are fixed to the chassis and are positioned above each wheel. The front wings have the front indicators on. The rear wings have the rear lights, brake lights, indicators and reflectors. The number plate is mounted on the right rear wing. Body panels are made out of aluminium, carbon fibre or typically fibreglass (GRP) The W152's mechanicals are from a Jaguar XJ from 1968-1986. There are three different engine options in a W152, the Jaguar XK6, AJ6 or V12. Any appropriate gearbox can be used but normally a suitable manual gearbox from a Jaguar is used. The W152 uses the independent rear suspension (IRS) unit and front wishbones from the Jaguar donor car but instead of using the standard springs and shock absorbers, it utilises modern coil over shocks. The steering rack is sourced from an MGB and uses extenders to the track-rod ends to suit the wider track of the car. The car uses the standard Jaguar brake calipers and discs but uses a different, split system pedal box, remote fluid reservoirs and twin servos. Most cars up until about 2011 used a custom built pedal box but they now use an OBP pedal box. The front suspension arms and steering arm and track rod end extensions are usually nickel-plated. The W152, does not have any doors (and on most cars) nor a windscreen, instead it uses two small Brooklands aero screens in the style of those classic Formula 1 cars. It has two seats which share a backrest. The W152 has undergone certification with seatbelt certification witnessed to full EU standards that was carried out by Manchester University (STATUS). Also Ronart were one of the first specialist car manufacturer to submit and achieve an A1 pass in a vehicle hydropulse test. This series of tests on a W152 aged the chassis and suspension components for an equivalent 100,000 miles within a two-week period. Engineering structures with crack detection were examined following the tests. Lightning V8 Ronart Lightning The Ronart Lightning V8 was launched at the 1999 International London Motor Show on 19 October 1999, only six months after work started on the project. The successful launch of the concept car saw Ronart receiving direct twenty four orders for the Lightning sports car. Work started in earnest in 2000 and changes were made to enhance the vehicles lines and shape as well as development of interior/chassis and exterior components. Two further concept shells were built until the road going prototype car was completed. The Lightning V8 was powered by a Ford Mustang SVT Cobra providing 320BHP as standard with optional 500BHP supercharged version. The last two cars built were fitted with superchargers. The V8 was fitted up to a five speed manual gearbox and with a Hydralock differential for power control. The car featured interior refinements such as electric heated operated and cooled Recaro seats, electric windscreen demist with electric windows and mirrors, leather upholstery reversing camera and sat nav. The chassis was of a multitubular spaceframe construction which when combined with lightweight carbon fibre body was designed to be a full convertible var. Specialist Rhoddy Harvey-Bailey at H.B.Engineering worked on the handling characteristics and carried out road going testing and development of both chassis and suspension. During the year 2000/2001 development work was carried out on a new carbon fibre process and material called SPRINT Technology. Ronart were the first to use this new low cost material and process for car body production. Pre-production started in 2002 with setting up of a build and manufacturing line at Westwood Farm. In June 2003 the new owners changed business strategy and closed the factory after pulling out and investing in another car company. The Lightning V8 production ceased after only seven cars were built and delivered to customers, many more current active orders were cancelled at the time References External links * Official Ronart Cars website * The Ronart Drivers' Club website * Ronart Designer's website Category:Car manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Sports car manufacturers Category:Luxury motor vehicle manufacturers Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1984 Category:British companies established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in England ","title":"Ronart Cars"},{"id":"13064858","text":"Family law in Canada concerns the body of Canadian law dealing with domestic partnerships, marriage, and divorce.  Sources of family law  In Canada, family law is primarily statute-based. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over marriage and divorce under section 91(26) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The main piece of federal legislation governing the issues arising upon married spouses’ separation and the requirements for divorce is the Divorce Act. Pursuant to the Divorce Act, the federal government has jurisdiction over child custody and access matters and spousal and child support during or after divorce.Zacks v. Zacks, [1973] S.C.R. 891 The Divorce Act does not govern property issues. The provinces have exclusive jurisdiction over the solemnization of marriage under section 92(12) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and jurisdiction over spousal and child support, property division, custody and access, adoption, and child protection as part of the provincial government's jurisdiction over property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and jurisdiction over matters of a private nature under section 92(16) of the Act. Each province has an Act that addresses the rules of property division upon marriage breakdown.Ont: Family Law Act, NS:Matrimonial Property Act  Marriage  Since 2005, a marriage may be formed between two individuals of different sex marriage in Canada|same sex .see the Civil Marriage Act, SC 2005, c. 33. This Act was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in the decision of Reference re Same-sex Marriage Marriages are prohibited where an individual does not have the capacity or where there is a direct familial relationship such as parent/child or brother/sister.see The Marriages (Prohibited Degrees) Act SC 1990 c. 4 The minimum age to marry is 16 years. A valid marriage must be properly solemnized within the rules of the province.Ontario: Marriage Act, NS:Solemnization Act, RSNS 1989, c.436 Annulments A marriage may be nullified as void or voidable much in the same manner as a contract. A marriage is void when the parties do not have the capacity to marry (known as the essential validity of the marriage). Thus, marriages between blood relations, or parties already married, underage, or otherwise unable to consent would all be invalid for lack of essential validity. A marriage is voidable and can be annulled by a court if the spouses are incapable of consummating the marriage. The formal prerequisites of a valid marriage are set out in the Marriage ActsMarriage Acts of Canadian provinces and territories. The parties must have a marriage license, be of proper age, or have parental consent. A marriage performed outside of the province will be valid if it is valid where the marriage is celebrated, that is lex loci celebrationis.  Separation and contracts  The legal implications of a marital separation may be governed by a contract. A separation agreement is typically negotiated and drafted with or without the assistance of lawyers. It is best negotiated when both parties are represented by their own legal counsel. It can set out the parties' agreement with respect to the division of property as well as child support, spousal support, custody, and access. Full financial disclosure and supporting documentation such as appraisals and income tax information is strongly recommended before parties enter into an agreement regarding support and property matters. Many jurisdictions offer mediation services to help parties resolve or narrow their issues, either with or without lawyers. Parties can also enter into pre- nuptial contracts to regulate the economic consequences of a future marriage breakdown. If it is shown that one party had unfairly negotiated the agreement can be invalidated.Hartshorne v. Hartshorne [2004] 1 S.C.R. 550, 2004 SCC 22Miglin v. Miglin, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 303 It is important that full and accurate financial disclosure is produced prior to entering into a marriage or cohabitation agreement, or there is a risk that the agreement could later be set aside by a court. Custody, access and child support cannot be agreed upon in a marriage or cohabitation agreement.  Divorce  Under the Divorce Act, a spouse may only apply for a divorce when the spouses have been separate and apart for at least one year, when there has been adultery or cruelty. Practically, almost all divorces are processed under an application based on being separate and apart for at least one year. It is possible for spouses to live separate and apart while sharing the same residence. A central registry of divorce proceedings has been kept in Canada since July 2, 1968. If there is another divorce application involving the same two spouses, the Registry lets the courts know. Courts must complete an application form and send it to the Registry for each divorce application received. The Registry was created and is governed by Regulations made under the Divorce Act.https://laws- lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-86-600/FullText.html  Division of property  Matrimonial property can be divided any time during or after the separation, divorce, or death. All matrimonial assets and property is presumed to be split evenly between spouses, after deducting debts. The scope of divisible matrimonial assets varies among provinces. Most provinces include all assets acquired during the marriage and any other assets pooled together.Provinces such as Nova Scotia include all assets possessed before marriage as well. The most significant divisible assets include matrimonial home and pensions.Pensions were found to be matrimonial property in Clarke v. Clarke, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 795 Assets excluded typically include inheritances (unless the inheritance has been used to purchase the matrimonial home or has paid on the mortgage of the matrimonial home) and monetary damages for personal injuries. Business assets may also be excluded in some provinces. Business assets are typically limited to assets that produce an immediate gain in some entrepreneurial capacity. The value of a business owned by a spouse can be determined and included in the property to be divided.  Custody and access  Custody and access are the terms used to describe the involvement of each parent in the lives of their children after separation. \\"Custody\\" is a term used to identify the decision making responsibility of each parent, with parents who have \\"sole custody\\" making significant decisions in their children's lives such as education, health, and religious upbringing. Parents who have \\"joint custody\\" make these decisions jointly. Joint custody can be difficult in situations where parties have poor communication following separation and/or where there has been violence in the relationship. \\"Access\\" describes the amount of time spent with children, including a regular parenting schedule and time spent over holidays, pursuant to a schedule set out in a separation agreement or imposed by a court if the parties have been unable to agree. In exceptional circumstances, grandparents or other relatives may be granted rights to exercise access. A new federal bill was introduced on May 22, 2018. Bill C-78 proposes to repeal the terms \\"custody\\" and \\"access\\" from the Divorce Act in favour of the terms such as \\"decision making responsibility\\" and \\"parenting time\\" which could be set out in a \\"parenting order\\" (if the matter is before the courts). In determining questions of custody / access and parenting arrangements, the main consideration is to look at what is in the best interests of the child or children. This is found in the legislation and as well the Supreme Court of CanadaYoung v Young, [1993] 4 SCR 3 at 10 has referred to the best interests of the child as a child’s “positive right to the best possible arrangements in the circumstances.” There are numerous factors to be considered in examining what is in the best interest of the child or children. Bill C-78, which contains proposed amendments to the Divorce Act and other federal family law legislation, sets out a list of criteria to be considered in determining the best interest of the child or children.https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/pl/charter- charte/c78.html A few examples of these criteria include: the child’s needs, given the child’s age and stage of development, such as the child’s need for stability; the nature and strength of the child’s relationship with each spouse, each of the child’s siblings and grandparents and any other person who plays an important role in the child’s life and each spouse’s willingness to support the development and maintenance of the child’s relationship with the other spouse.http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-78/first-reading  Child support Child support is determined by the federal or provincial Child Support Guidelines. The basic (\\"table\\") amount of support is determined by the payer's income and the number of children in need of support. In a situation where each parent has custody of one or more child, the amount of child support payable is the difference between the amount each parent would pay the other for the table amount. In split custody, where each spouse has custody of one or more children, the amount of a child support order is the difference between the amount that each spouse would otherwise pay if a child support order were sought against each of the spouses. Special and extraordinary expenses that are specifically listed in §7 of the Child Support Guidelines, such as daycare, medical insurance coverage, health, education, and extracurricular expenses, may be ordered by the court to be shared by the parents. The expenses must be necessary with respect to the best interests of the child and must be reasonable having regard to the means and needs of the parents and children. Private schools and tutoring expenses and also extracurricular expenses are only allowable if they are \\"extraordinary\\".  Spousal support  The entitlement and value of spousal support is determined on a holistic basis that varies greatly depending on the circumstances. There is no single basis of entitlement and there is no single philosophy behind the reasons for support. The three grounds of entitlement are compensatory, non- compensatory (i.e. needs-based), and contractual. Moge v. Moge first addressed compensatory basis. The court found in most marriages one party tends to suffer economic disadvantage from the marriage. The disadvantaged party may be compensated to the point of returning both parties to the point they were before the marriage breakdown. Compensation is measured on the degree of contribution to the marriage, sacrifice, and hardship. The agreement between the two parties is contract-based support based upon their marriage or separation contract. The non-compensatory basis focuses on the mutual obligation of support created by the marriage. Thus, in circumstances where one party is disabled the other party will be under an obligation to continue their support of the other as part of the initial obligation in marriage.See Bracklow v. Bracklow, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420 In 2008, the federal government released the final version of the Spousal Support Advisory GuidelinesSpousal Support Advisory Guidelines which were meant as a means of estimating support based on income. It has no binding effect in law, but rather is used as a tool for negotiations and settlement. The guidelines distinguish between spouses with children and without children. The formula for spouses without children provides a range of between 1.5 and two percent of the difference in gross incomes for each year of cohabitation. The duration of the payment would be one half of a year to one year for every year of the marriage. If it is over 20 years this it is of indefinite duration. Spouses with children would expect a range between 40 and 46 percent of the sum of each spouse's \\"net disposable income\\". Net disposable income for the payer is equal to the spouse's income subtracted by child support, taxes, and other deductions. Net disposable income for the payee is equal to the spouse's income minus child support, taxes, deductions plus government benefits and credits.

Pathologically, there is motor axonal degeneration with antibody- mediated attacks of motor nerves and nodes of Ranvier.  Causes  A link to Campylobacter jejuni was suspected when a young girl was admitted to Second Teaching Hospital. She had become ill after feeding the family chickens. She developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure. Investigators discovered that several of the chickens in the home displayed similar symptoms and C. jejuni was found in their droppings. Several of the paralysis patients were found to have antibodies to C. jejuni and anti-GD1a antibodies, suggesting a link between the pathogen and the disease. In 2015, Zika virus was linked to AMAN. Diagnosis The syndrome typically presents as a progressive flaccid symmetric paralysis with areflexia, often causing respiratory failure. Electromyographic studies and nerve conduction studies show normal motor conduction velocity and latency with decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials. Pathologically, it is a noninflammatory axonopathy without demyelination. Antibodies attack the coating of the motor neurons without causing inflammation or loss of myelin. It does not affect sensory neurons, so sensation remains intact despite loss of movement. Treatment  History  AMAN, also known as Chinese Paralytic Syndrome,Biller J. Practical Neurology, Second Edition. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; 2002:Pg 361 was first described by a group of Johns Hopkins University and University of Pennsylvania neurologists in collaboration with neurologists from the Second Teaching Hospital of Hebei Medical School and Beijing Children's Hospital. In 1991, Guy Mckhann, Jack Griffin, Dave Cornblath and Tony Ho from Johns Hopkins University and Arthur Asbury from University of Pennsylvania visited China to study a mysterious epidemic of paralytic syndrome occurring in northern China. Every summer, hundreds of children from rural China developed acute paralysis and respiratory failure. Hospitals were overwhelmed with number of cases and often ran out of ventilators and hospital beds. Examination of these children showed that many of them had acute flaccid paralysis and areflexia but with little or no sensory loss. Electrophysiological testing of these children showed motor axonal loss with occasional conduction block with a lack of demyelinating features and normal sensory potentials. In contrast, the common form of Guillain–Barré syndrome in the West often presents with sensory loss and demyelination on electrophysiology testing and is more common in adults. Later, several autopsies confirmed the focus of the immune attack was at the motor axolemma especially around the nodes of Ranvier. These cases showed deposition of antibody and complement along the motor axolemma and associated macrophage infiltration.

Roosevelt.The New York Times, June 14, 2001. Ralph Blumenthal, A Pied-à-Terre Designed By a President; F. D. R. Never Slept Here, But Entertained Dignitaries And Enjoyed RendezvousFranklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum - Dutchess County Stone Buildings Built in 1938 to 1939, during Roosevelt's second term as President of the United States, it was designed to accommodate his need for wheelchair accessibility. It was one of the earliest such buildings in the country, and the first significant building designed by a person with a disability. Although it was meant as a retreat, FDR also received notable guests at the cottage, including Britain's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. After half a century in private ownership, the property was restored and given to the National Park Service, which today operates it as part of the nearby Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site. Top Cottage was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Guided tours of the cottage are available from the main site but private vehicles are not permitted. This building is the only building designed by a sitting U.S. President other than Thomas Jefferson, who designed several at his home in Monticello, Poplar Forest, the University of Virginia, and the Virginia State Capitol. Building and site The cottage is in the Dutch Colonial Revival architectural style, built of fieldstone. It is one of several buildings in Hyde Park and surrounding communities that FDR ensured were built in that style, which he hoped to revive in the region. It is located at the end of Potters Bend Road, a residential street in a rural area of Hyde Park, at the top of the 500-foot (152 m) ridgetop unofficially known as Dutchess Hill where Roosevelt had played as a child. In FDR's time, it had commanding views of the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains, now obscured by trees. History Floor plan as sketched by Roosevelt Suckley's photographs of Roosevelt with Ruthie Bie (later Bautista), then three years old, the daughter of the property caretakers and Fala (1941) Although Roosevelt built a vacation house in Georgia at the end of his term as governor of New York (near the hot-spring estate in Bullochville, Georgia that he had bought in 1927 and renamed Warm Springs), he had never owned a year-round home of his own; he had moved into his mother's house at Hyde Park, enlarged for him and his family, and otherwise lived in family townhouses in New York City, rented houses in Albany and Washington, D.C., or official residences such as the New York State Executive Mansion and the White House. In 1933, Roosevelt realized the family home in Hyde Park did not offer him sufficient distance from the pressures of the presidency. He realized he would need a more isolated retreat, \\"a small place to go to escape the mob...\\" Two years later, Roosevelt and his cousin Margaret Suckley spent some time together on the top of the hill, with a view over the Hudson River to the Catskill Mountains, and were both impressed by the possibilities. He would refer to it as \\"Our Hill\\"; she as \\"the nicest Hill in Dutchess County\\". In October of that year he suggested it would be the perfect spot for \\"a one-story fieldstone two-room house ... one with very thick walls to protect us.\\" She responded enthusiastically, with a sketch that looks similar to the finished building. Roosevelt at first envisioned it as where he would live after his presidency, and bought the hillside parcel in 1937, after his re-election. By that point in his life, he needed to use a wheelchair for much of the time due to his paralytic illness and could only walk short distances with great difficulty and assistance, a fact he and others concealed from the public. He designed the cottage to accommodate the wheelchair, with one flat floor and everything he could want or need located within easy reach of someone in a sitting position. Top Cottage is the only presidential residence, other than Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and Poplar Forest, designed by a president. It is also the first significant accessible building designed by a disabled person. Roosevelt began submitting sketches to architects in 1938. He commissioned architect Henry Toombs to help finish the design, who suggested Roosevelt be credited as architect despite his lack of professional training or experience, angering some Republican architects when an article about the cottage doing exactly that ran in Life magazine. There are some indications that Toombs was the architect but suggested that he be listed only as the associate with Roosevelt being credited as the architect. Crediting Roosevelt as the architect brought criticism from others, including John Lloyd Wright, son of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright said, \\"awaited 'pictures of 'Doctor' Roosevelt performing an appendectomy.'\\" At the time when houses cost $1,000 the cottage cost $16,599, but in the end, it is thought that Roosevelt never spent a single night at the cottage; despite being designed after becoming disabled, his mother's larger home was more suitable for Roosevelt's disability. The design had many other problems; the ventilation was faulty, the bedrooms were too small, and it had only one bathroom and no closets. Nonetheless, when guests visited Hyde Park, Roosevelt always showed them Top Cottage first. Modern renovations to the cottage, allowing it to open to the public, cost $1,500,000, including $750,000 to buy the cottage. The next year it would be host to the famous picnic where Roosevelt cooked and served hot dogs to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on the first state visit to the United States by a British sovereign. It was during the King and Queen's visit that Roosevelt broke protocol and proposed a toast to the Queen. She reportedly became flustered at the break in protocol and drank to herself. His original intention to use it as a retirement home were put on hold when he won an unprecedented third term the next year. But he continued to use Top Cottage as a retreat, bringing important visitors such as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill there to discuss the atomic bomb, as well as close friends like Suckley, who took the only two published photos of him in his wheelchair on the cottage's porch. After Roosevelt's death, his son Elliott Roosevelt lived there for a while. He made some renovations, such as adding dormer windows and a mud room. Later he sold the house to the Potter family, who gave their name to the street leading to the home. It remained in their possession until 1996, when it was sold again to the Open Space Institute (OSI). The following year it was recognized as a National Historic Landmark, and the OSI began renovations, removing Elliott Roosevelt's additions and thinning some of the trees that had obstructed the view. In 2001, it was turned over to the National Park Service to be made part of the existing historic site. The house was opened to the public for the first time in 2001. It is used as a conference center, in addition to being open to the public. Location and further information The cottage is located in Hyde Park, New York. It is open only to those with reservations.FDR's Top Cottage - Hyde Park New York Although the original furnishings were lost, the Park Service has now (2011) furnished the main area with reproductions and antiques which match the original contents. The cottage was subject of a review book, The President as Architect: Franklin D. Roosevelt's Top Cottage, was compiled by John G. Waite Associates, an Albany architectural firm specializing in restorations. It is also prominently featured in the 2012 film, Hyde Park on Hudson.

But he was soon assigned to the Admiralty's Submarine Tracking Room (part of the Operational Intelligence Centre - OIC), although he was still a civilian. Though new to the naval environment, he quickly came to understand U-boat tactics, and could frequently predict their actions. As a result, he was promoted to command the Tracking Room, as a temporary Commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. It is a measure of his ability that he received this rank and position without formal naval officer training, which was unprecedented at the time, and that he displaced his former superior. Winn's advancement was no surprise to his colleagues and he extended his influence within the OIC. During the German attacks on shipping off the U.S. coast, Winn was sent to America to put the British case. His arguments and expertise proved effective; he managed to persuade Admiral Ernest King (the formidable USN commander in chief), to implement a convoy system. Winn was a keen student of ULTRA intelligence. From ULTRA and his observations of U-boat movements, he deduced that German codebreakers had cracked the BAMS (Broadcast to Allied Merchant Ships) code used by the Admiralty for convoy operations. In 1943 he eventually convinced the Admiralty to make the necessary revisions to BAMS. After the war, captured records showed that the German Navy's Beobachtungsdienst (Signals Intelligence Service) had been reading BAMS since the start of the conflict. In 1944, the Germans equipped the U-boats with snorkels, so that they could operate without surfacing. It was still extremely difficult for a U-boat to navigate without surfacing. But U-boats operating in the dangerous waters south of Ireland managed anyway. Winn guessed that they were using their depth sounders to locate and fix on a particular conical seamount. He arranged for a double agent to send a bogus message, warning the Germans of a new British minefield \\"where [the U-boats] go to fix their position.\\" The Germans soon declared a zone 60 miles square, prohibited to U-boats and centered on that seamount. Winn's war-time work was crucial to the Allied success in the Battle of the Atlantic. Without this success, Britain might have been forced out of the war. By the war's end, Winn attained the rank of Captain. His reputation and influence extended to the United States, where his Tracking Room was the model for a similar facility.Gannon, Michael - Operation Drumbeat - the dramatic true story of Germany's first U-boat attacks along the American coast in World War II, 1990, Harper and Row publishers, , p. 340 He received an OBE in 1943, and the American Legion of Merit in 1945. Post-war career Winn returned to the Bar after the war. From 1954 to 1959, he served as Junior Counsel to the Treasury (Common Law). He was appointed as a judge of the High Court in 1959, assigned to the Queen's Bench Division, and received the customary knighthood. In 1965, he became a Lord Justice of Appeal, and was made a Privy Counsellor. He also served on several important official and legal committees. Rodger Winn died on 4 June 1972.

The channel was launched on 19 September 2008 and is on-air for up to seven hours a day. The name ' is the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland. The station is unique in that it is the first channel to be delivered under a BBC licence by a partnership and is also the first multi- genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland. BBC Alba has an average viewership of 637,000 adults over the age of 16 in Scotland each week.http://www.mgalba.com/downloads/reports/annual-report-12-13.pdf  History  Old logo (2008–2018) In 2007, the BBC Trust opened a consultation for a Gaelic digital service in partnership with the Gaelic Media Service. Following the BBC Trust consultation in November 2007, the Audience Council Scotland recommended their support for the creation of the service on 7 December 2007, stating that the Trust should pursue carriage of the service on digital terrestrial television and that the existing \\"Gaelic zone\\" programming on BBC Scotland should remain after the launch. On 28 January 2008, the BBC Trust gave the go-ahead for a Gaelic channel. The channel began broadcasting on satellite at 9:00 pm on 19 September 2008 with a launch video featuring a new rendition of the Runrig song, '. The first part of a live cèilidh from Skye, presented by Mary Ann Kennedy, was followed by a specially produced comedy drama entitled ' (Elvis), starring Greg Hemphill as Elvis Presley, at 9:30 pm. The channel's first independent commission, ' (Peter Manuel - The End of Evil?), a drama documentary produced by STV Productions, was shown at 10:30 pm before the opening night closed with the second half of the live cèilidh from Skye. The launch night was simulcast on BBC Two Scotland between 9:00 pm and 10:30 pm and there was a launch event held at the National Museum of Scotland, which was recorded by the channel's news service '. A study carried out for the channel indicated that 650,000 people watched BBC Alba per week in the first two months of broadcasting, in spite of only being available to around a third of Scots. After being subject to a review by the BBC Trust and a recommendation from the Audience Council Scotland in 2009, a plan was announced to broadcast the channel on Freeview, in Scotland only, from the digital switchover (2010) under the proviso that reach of the service extended beyond the core Gaelic audience to 250,000. This was approved on 27 December 2010 by the BBC Trust and the service launched on Freeview on 8 June 2011. The channel also launched on Virgin Media (Scotland only) on 18 May 2011, and was made available nationwide on the Virgin Media and Sky platforms, the former on 6 November 2012.  Operation  Pacific Quay in Glasgow, from where BBC Alba is transmitted.

Programmes are also available to watch on the Internet live through services including the BBC iPlayer and some programmes are available for seven days after broadcast on this service and on catch up services of some other services. The channel is financed from the BBC Scotland budget and by MG Alba, which itself is financed by the Scottish Government and UK Government. The BBC spent £8 million on the channel, of which £5 million was used for programming, in 2011/12 MG Alba applies the majority of its budget (£12.4 million in 2008/09) to the Gaelic Digital Service. BBC Alba continuity presentation and channel management is based in Stornoway, while the news services are based in Inverness. BBC Scotland's headquarters at Pacific Quay in Glasgow is used to transmit the programmes.  Content  BBC Alba combines television, radio and on-line programme content. BBC Alba broadcasts more Scottish sport than any other channel, with over three hours a week of football, rugby and shinty. In addition, the station also broadcasts a live news programme every day, with the weekend news provision beginning in 2018.  Programming  Output on the channel consists of news, current affairs, sport, drama, documentary, entertainment, education, religion and children's programming, broadcast on most days between 5 pm and 12 am. Children's programmes are shown for two hours every weekday, between 17:00 and 19:00.

Subtitling  Most of the adult programming on BBC Alba contains on-screen English subtitles. For logistical reasons, live broadcasts (including the news) are not subtitled, although certain events (e.g. the annual Hogmanay broadcast ') have scripted elements that are subtitled, while interviews and ad-libbed lines are not. Children's programmes are not subtitled. Controversially, no English dialogue on the channel is subtitled into Scottish Gaelic.  Sport  BBC Alba concentrates on four sports: football, rugby, shinty. and curling.https://www.scottishcurling.org/rccc-invests-to-secure- bbc-alba-live-curling-coverage/ During the 2009–10 season, the station broadcast one full Scottish Premier League game every Saturday night. The game selected was always one not covered by either live Sky Sports or on an on- demand basis by BT Vision and was shown three hours after the end of the match. The matches only included Gaelic commentary along with English subtitles. The channel reached an agreement with the Scottish Football League to broadcast live football games during the 2008–09 season. This began with the final of the Challenge Cup, which was also sponsored by MG Alba.BBC Alba to screen live SFL games, BBC Sport, 3 February 2009. BBC Alba then started broadcasting First Division games, beginning with the match between Airdrie United and Clyde on 22 February 2009. BBC Alba also struck a deal with the Scottish rugby authorities to show one live rugby, Scottish Premiership Division One match every weekend. For the 2015–16 season, BBC Alba will show 20 live matches (excluding Rangers) from either 2015-16 Scottish Championship (including the play-off final), League 1 or League 2 as well as four matches from the Scottish Challenge Cup. The station also altered their coverage of Scottish Premiership highlights, showing one hour highlights of two non- televised matches on a Saturday and Sunday night at 22:00. Other football coverage includes all Scotland U21s and Women's matches. As well as the final of the 2015-16 Scottish Junior Cup. In 2010 BBC Alba bought the rights for Celtic League rugby jointly with public service broadcasters from the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Wales. In May 2020, BBC Alba broadcast the last five matches of Women's Bundesliga.  Independent production companies  A number of independent companies have been commissioned to produce content for the channel, or have productions currently airing. These include: * Theatre Hebrides (') * Madmac Productions (Broadford or Bust) * Caledonia Stern and Wylde (') * MnE Media, formerly known as ' (', ') * Tern TV (') * Eyeline Media (', ') * MacTV (') * Studio Alba (')  Criticism  English content and lack of Gaelic subtitles The Gaelic community, including writers Aonghas MacNeacail, Angus Peter Campbell, Lisa Storey and musician Allan MacDonald, have criticised the non-availability of Gaelic subtitles, and the emphasis on English language interviews and reportage in the channel's content for adults. Writers and authors were reported by the BBC Gaelic news service as setting up a campaign, GAIDHLIG.TV, to increase Gaelic content on BBC Alba. The decision to introduce 'red button facilities' to allow viewers to switch to English language sports commentary, first announced in August 2014 for rugby and the Guinness Pro12 series, was heavily criticised by the Gaelic community. The criticism resulted in MG Alba announcing publicly in the West Highland Free Press that the 'red button option' for English language commentary would not expand to other sports or areas of the channel.  Sports programming  Between its launch in September 2008 and the beginning of 2010, the BBC Alba channel lost a third of its viewers, but its number of viewers remains five times larger than the size of the Gaelic speech community in Scotland (just over 58,000). The historian Michael Fry has argued that many of its viewers only watch it for the football coverage, because \\"you don't need Gaelic to watch football\\", and that in this way the channel is \\"cheating\\". The model is, however, both common and intentional as it is on comparable channels such as the Irish language channel TG4, the Basque broadcaster EITB or the Welsh channel S4C. In Europe, these channels' main mission is not commercial, but the promotion of the original languages.  Freeview  Some criticism had been levied over the channel's addition to Freeview, primarily due to the BBC's original plan (with acceptance from the BBC Executive) to remove all 13 BBC Radio channels from Freeview for Scottish viewers over the period that BBC Alba will be shown on Freeview (between 5 pm and midnight); however the criticism has not been directed at the BBC's decision to extend BBC ALBA to Freeview in principle. On 19 May 2011, it was reported that the BBC has backed down on the plans, after the BBC had \\"managed to reengineer facilities\\" to allow BBC Radio 1Xtra, 5 Live and 6 Music to continue to broadcast on a 24-hour basis. The three stations were chosen because they have the highest evening audience ratings on digital television of the seven BBC radio stations unavailable on FM radio. On 2 December 2013, it was confirmed that more radio stations were made available 24 hours in Scotland, but with some trade-offs. BBC Radio 4, 4 Extra, 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Asian Network were restored, but as noted in the blog with some technical trade-offs, such as mono audio rather than stereo during the evenings on the radio stations mentioned and the audio bit rate of the TV channels in Scotland on Freeview reduced to 192 kbit/s from 256 kbit/s.

Anne de Batarnay de Joyeuse, Baron d'Arques, Vicomte then Duke of Joyeuse (1560 or 1561 – 20 October 1587) was a royal favourite and active participant in the French Wars of Religion. An intimate friend of Henry III of France, he was known as a minion and keeper of the king's chambers. With these serious responsibilities he also gained a number of privileges around the court, including the wearing of royal colors, such as royal blue, purple, and red. He also had the right to wear jewelry of high majesties of the court, such as a well-known red ruby and diamond ring given to him by the king: it had been confiscated from Princesse Marguerite de Valois as punishment for having accused Anne of trying to interfere with a meeting with the king, as requested of her by Catherine de' Medici. Anne was also a member of the circle of young courtiers known as Les Mignons. Anne was born in 1560 in the château de Joyeuse. He was the eldest son of Guillaume, 8th Vicomte de Joyeuse, the owner of the rights to the Bishopric of Alet and Marshal of France in 1575. Cardinal François de Joyeuse was his younger brother. He was reared in Toulouse and attended the Collège de Navarre, starting in August 1572. Wedding of Anne de Joyeuse with Marguerite de Vaudémont, 24 September 1581 in Le Louvre. On the left under the dais are Henry III, Catherine de Médicis, and Queen Louise. French school 1581-1582. From 1577 onward, Anne accompanied his father in the annual expeditions against the Huguenots to Languedoc and Auvergne. In 1579, he was put in charge of a compagnie d'ordonnance and was soon appointed governor of Mont Saint- Michel. In 1580, he took part in the siege of Fère-en-Tardenois. The King arranged Joyeuse's marriage to his sister-in-law, Marguerite, daughter of Nicholas, Duke of Mercœur. The nuptials were celebrated on 18 September 1581 with unprecedented magnificence. King Henry used the marriage as a pretext for elevating his favourite to the dignity of Duc de Joyeuse. He was given precedence over all other dukes and peers of France, with the exception of princes of the blood. In addition to more than 300 000 écus in dowry, he was given the seigneury of Limours. In the next year, the 21-year-old mignon was made Grand-admiral de France (1 June) and commander in the Order of the Holy Spirit, the kingdom's highest (31 December). He was appointed governor of Normandy in 1583 and Le Havre in 1584. After the death of Duke François the Joyeuse brothers were allowed to govern the duchies of Anjou and Alençon in the name of the king. His massacre of 800 Huguenots during a campaign in Poitou (the Massacre de Saint-Eloi, 21 June 1587) incurred the displeasure of the King. He was received coldly at court and, anxious to be restored to Henry's favour, led royal troops against the king's arch-enemy, Henry of Navarre. He suffered a defeat at the hands of the Huguenots in the Battle of Coutras and was taken prisoner. Although he offered a ransom of 100,000 écus, Joyeuse was killed in revenge for the massacre of Saint-Eloi, as was his 18-year-old brother Claude, lord of Saint-Sauveur. He was childless and was succeeded as Duke of Joyeuse by another brother, François.

Previously called the Archdiocese of the Old Catholic Church in America the name was subsequently changed to the Old (Roman) Catholic Church in America.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Hm8aAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=FyoEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7190%2C2445306 The Old Roman Catholic Church of America retains pre-Vatican II liturgical and doctrinal traditions, including the use of the pre-1955 Roman Calendar of St. Pius X and unrevised Roman Missal, in Latin or vernacular. It is not a member of, or in full communion with, the Union of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Churches. History Resch separated from the North American Old Roman Catholic Church, after being made a bishop of that church by its leader Carmel Henry Carfora. He started his own church, the Diocese of Kankakee, which was centered on the site of his parish in Kankakee, Illinois. The new church quickly grew to establish other parishes in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. These parishes, largely consisting of first generation immigrants from Eastern Europe, became inactive as the children of the congregants adjusted to life in America. In 1963, Resch made Walter X. Brown a bishop. Brown would later succeed Resch as the archbishop of the church. He was responsible for moving the church's headquarters to Milwaukee, where it now has a seminary and maintains a number of charitable organizations. It also maintains a monastery in the Franciscan tradition in Chicago, and two monastic communities in Milwaukee, one following the Eastern tradition and one following the Western tradition. The Archdiocese accepts the traditions of Christianity as transmitted by the seven ecumenical councils through the Second Council of Nicaea and the Church Fathers. It practices the seven sacraments, and their official statement of faith, the Statement of Faith of the Old Catholic Church in America, closely resembles the Nicene Creed. The Church has in recent years entered into communion with the Old Roman Catholic Church in Europe. The 1917 Pio-Benedictine Code of Canon Law with some amendments is used as the law regulating the Church. Congregations In 1984, the church reported total membership of 2,300 in 14 congregations with 26 clergy. It has churches in Dallas and Brownsville, Texas; Erie, Pennsylvania; Chicago; Racine, Madison, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Brooklyn, New York; Phoenix, Arizona; Glendale, Arizona; Kingman, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; Louisiana and Ottawa. It has affiliated branches operating in Germany, Belgium, and England. The church at one point provided care to those with substance abuse issues.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D3YfAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=hCgEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5038%2C1551447 Archbishops * Paul Francis Cope 1925 – 1953 * Francis Xavier Resch 1953-1963 * Walter Xavier Brown 1963-1997 * James Edward Bostwick 1997-2009 * Sherman Randall Mosley 2009-2010 * Henry Pleau 2010 - 2014 * Charles Walders 2014 - 2015 * David Persyn 2015-present References External links *Old Roman Catholic Church of America website *Orthodox - Old Catholic Dialogue Category:Old Catholicism in the United States Category:Old Catholic church buildings in Wisconsin Category:Christian organizations established in 1925 Category:Catholicism in Wisconsin Category:Christian denominations established in the 20th century Category:Old Catholic denominations in the United States ","title":"Old Catholic Church of America"},{"id":"13065151","text":"The Fullerton Hotel Singapore is a five-star luxury hotel located near the mouth of the Singapore River, in the Downtown Core of the Central Area, Singapore. It was originally known as the Fullerton Building, and also as the General Post Office Building. The address is 1 Fullerton Square. The Fullerton Building was named after Robert Fullerton, the first Governor of the Straits Settlements (1826–1829). Commissioned in 1924 as part of the British colony's centennial celebrations, the building was designed as an office building by Major P.H. Keys of Keys & Dowdeswell, a Shanghai firm of architects, which won the project through an architectural design competition. The architectural firm also designed the Capitol Theatre, its adjoined Capitol Building and the Singapore General Hospital. History  Fort Fullerton and the Singapore Stone  Aerial perspective of Fullerton Hotel, Singapore. Shot October 2018. The northern end of the building covers the site of Fort Fullerton, a fort built in 1829 to defend the settlement against any naval attacks. The fort consisted of an Artillery Barrack, a house for the officers, barracks for soldiers and a 68-pounder gun guarding the entrance to the river which used to stand on the location known as Fullerton square.Nhbgovsg. (2016). Nhbgovsg. Retrieved 28 February 2016, from http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/sites-and- monuments/national-monuments/former-fullerton-building In 1843, the fort was extended after a sandstone monolith, the Singapore Stone, with an inscription possibly dating back to the 13th century was demolished. The Singapore stone was, unfortunately, destroyed by the British.\\"Singapore Stone\\". Singapore Paranormal Investigators. 2000–2005. Retrieved 13 July 2007. The citation is from Rouffaer, G.P.

A fragment of this monolith was salvaged and preserved in the collection of the National Museum at Stamford Road. However, there were several criticisms as well as apprehensions regarding the building of Fort Fullerton. Merchants thought that it was a waste to use the prime location of the city for military instead of trading purpose, which would have prevented Singapore from generating more revenue and boosting its trading business. They were also worried that they would be in the direct line of fire if there were any attacks on the fort because the offices along the Singapore River were situated in close proximity to the fort. The fort was also said to be incapable of deterring any potential attacks from the sea, and had very low efficacy. Following these criticisms, the fort was finally demolished in 1873.(Koh, 2015) The fort gave way to the first General Post Office and the Exchange Building in 1874. Plans to erect Fullerton Building were drawn up in 1920. However, due to a lack of funds, construction only began in February 1924. During the initial groundwork, excavations revealed the gun casements of the old Fort Fullerton. In fact, the Fullerton Building was built over reclaimed land. Built at a cost of $4.1 million and after delays of a few months, the building was completed in June 1928. The Fullerton Building was opened on 27 June 1928 by the Governor, Sir Hugh Clifford, who suggested the building be named after Robert Fullerton. The building had five founding tenants: the General Post Office, The Exchange, Singapore Club (now Singapore Town Club), the Marine Department, and the Import and Export Department (later the Ministry of Trade and Industry). It also housed the Chamber of Commerce, and various government departments dealing with agriculture, fisheries and forestry. One of the rooms in the Fullerton Building was where the late Finance Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, wrote many of his budget speeches for Singapore.(Lim, 2015) The building was designed to utilize natural ventilation, thus has four internal air-wells to cool the interiors. Fullerton Square was an important commerce area in Singapore attracting many European immigrants and soon became the core of major business activity. Many European businesses were set up at Fullerton Square together with large banks such as the Chartered Bank and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banks. The Fullerton Building was built with Grandeur, Class and being the biggest structure built in Singapore displaying the authority and power of the British Colonial rule. In addition, The Fullerton Building operated with tax payers money meant as a government building, housed the Club for the Colonial Elite which was an exclusive club that took up almost 7,000 sq m of the upper floors which further elaborated the position and authority that the British has in Singapore. There was also a lighthouse on the Fullerton Building, called the Fullerton Light, which was used to guide the ships ashore and to anchor along the piers. It was built to replace the Fort Canning Light, which was decommissioned in 1979 since it was gradually blocked because of globalization and the construction of more high-rise buildings in Singapore.(Cornelius-Takahama, 2015) The location of the previous lighthouse is now being occupied by The Lighthouse Restaurant, to keep up with the modern style of the Fullerton Hotel.  General Post Office  The General Post Office (GPO) was the purpose of the building as envisioned and it was this strategic purpose for which it was commissioned. GPO covered the two lower floors with postal halls, offices and sorting rooms. There were mail drops through which mail would fall to a band conveyor on the basement and dispatched up to the sorting room. One of the most memorable features is its curved service counter which was almost 90m long. The basement was linked to a 35-metre subway, also called the GPO tunnel that ran underneath Fullerton Road to a pier. From there, a lift would bring bags of mail to the Master Attendant's Pier, and then transferred onto ships that were anchored at the pier. Special mail was all sent to the neighbouring countries via sea, which was the main transport back then, thus requiring at least 2 months to reach United Kingdom.Fullerton Hotel. \\"The Fullerton Stories Personality, Mr M. Bala Subramanion.\\" Video. Youtube. January 28, 2016. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WBzxyPwPww. This is further delayed by the fact that all mail had to be personally sorted by hands. Before postal workers were allowed to work, they had to pledge to uphold their integrity. As public servants, they were not allowed to leak any information on what went through them (including the origin of the mail). Everything at work was strictly confidential. In the past, there was no bank transfers available thus people often sent money by post using envelopes without using registered mail due to the higher cost incurred. Thus, it is extremely important that postal workers were honest and did not steal any items that went through the mail. To reinforce the importance of confidentiality, the comptroller of the General Post Office would stand at the gallery above the sorting halls to observe all postal workers and ensure none of the letters or mail were opened while being sorted.Fullerton Hotel. \\"The Fullerton Stories Personality, Mr M. Bala Subramanion.\\" Video. Youtube. January 28, 2016. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WBzxyPwPww. The life of postal workers back then was incomparable with postmen working at Singapore Post today. Fridays used to be the day which overseas mail would arrive from Britain and postal workers had to work overtime with no extra pay, just to wait for the mail to arrive and then sieve through and sort them before ending work. Also, they were not entitled to any days off and had to work around the clock.Tan, Judith, Ms. \\"Keeping Mouth Shut Vital for Job.\\" Asiaone. December 16, 2014. http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/keeping-mouth-shut-vital-job. They are also not required to personally separate local and overseas letters. An interesting discovery from the history of the General Post Office is the presence of Santa Claus Main Office up till today. During Christmas seasons in the past, the post office would be filled with letters from children, which are all directed to Santa Claus. These letters were then sent to the Salvation Army, who would reply the children on behalf of Santa Claus. Presently, these letters are forwarded to the Santa Claus Main Office which is situated in the Santa Claus Village in Finland. This shows that the British's establishments of fulfilling children's wishes are still present today although many significant changes had occurred.

Bedrooms on the attic storey provide accommodation for members. When the Economic Development Board (EDB) was formed in 1961, it evicted the Singapore Club from the Fullerton Building. Subsequently, the Singapore Club relocated to Clifford House at Collyer Quay and then to Straits Trading Building on Battery Road near Boat Quay, vacating Fullerton Building for use by EDB and more government offices.  World War II  In the last days before Britain's surrender to Japan in 1942, the building was used as a hospital, with makeshift operation rooms for wounded British soldiers. During the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, Governor Sir Shenton Thomas and Lady Thomas sought refuge in the sleeping quarters of the Singapore Club. The Fullerton Building was also where General Percival discussed with Sir Shenton the possibility of surrendering Singapore to the Japanese. Subsequently, Fullerton Building became the headquarters of the Japanese military administration in Singapore.  Post-war years  In 1950s, The Fullerton Building became recognised as the unofficial public monument. It stood out of the City's Skyline as the most prominent feature of the waterfront. On its rooftop stood the lighthouse, whose beacon guided all ships approaching the harbour. In time, The Fullerton became the symbol of Singapore, appearing in every postcard, recognised by traveller and ship captains from all over the world. Singapore was remembered all around the world with the image of The Fullerton Building.Fullertonhotelcom. (2016). Fullertonhotelcom. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from http://www.fullertonhotel.com/fullertonhistory-en.html In- text citation: (Fullertonhotelcom, 2016) In 1965, Singapore's independence from colonial status to nationhood took place at Fullerton Square. From the majestic background of the Fullerton Building, crowds declared their support for merdeka independence. From the 1970s to 1995, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore used the building as its headquarters. Internal alterations were carried out on the building by the Public Works Department in 1985. The General Post Office, under Singapore Post, vacated the building in March 1996. Though plans were initiated to conserve the Fullerton Building after that, it was only gazetted as a conservation building by the Singapore Government in 1997. Redevelopment In 1997, Sino Land (Hong Kong) Company Ltd, a sister company of Far East Organization, acquired the Fullerton Building from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). It spent close to another S$300 million converting Fullerton Building into a hotel and building the two-storey commercial complex One Fullerton opposite Fullerton Road. Renovation works on the Fullerton Building were completed on 8 December 2000. The Fullerton Hotel Singapore was officially opened by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on 1 January 2001. The site, sandwiched between the Civic District and the central business district, was sold together with an underpass and the seafront site on which One Fullerton now stands for S$110 million. The two are linked by an air-conditioned underground pedestrian walkway with travellators. To ensure that the historical Fullerton Building continues to be visible from Marina Bay, URA specified a low building height for One Fullerton across the road. This also ensured that guests at The Fullerton Hotel would have unobstructed views of the sea. Architecture and conservation  The Architect  Keys and Dowdeswell was an established British international architecture company, their design works can be seen in buildings throughout China and South East Asia from 1920s to 1940s, some of the most prominent buildings in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore were designed by them. Their design works are usually with major significance to a historical period, geographical place and local culture tradition, with many of their buildings in the classical style.Re-shaping Cities : How Global Mobility Transforms Architecture and Urban Form. 1 December 2014. Major Keys & Dowdeswell were established and distinguished designers of grand interior spaces and classical façades. They followed the principals of 20th-century Beaux-Arts tradition of classicism. Relating to some of their core principals in design, they are largely Monumental and Ornamental. Original design Atrium of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore The grey Aberdeen granite Fullerton Building sits on 41,100 square metres (442,400 square feet) of land. The height of its walls measures 36.6 metres (120 ft) from the ground. The building has Neo-classical architectural features which include a two-storey fluted Doric colonnades on their heavy base, and the lofty portico over the main entrance with trophy designs and the Royal Coat of Arms, crafted by Italian Cavaliere Rudolfo Nolli. Originally, there were five distinct frontages, each treated in the Doric order. 14 elevators served the four floors plus the basement floors. A hollow cellular raft foundation was proposed by the original contractors in the 1920s to save cost because bedrock lies directly below the building. The Fullerton Building also possesses the one and only barrel-vaulted, coffered ceiling in Singapore. Restoration The Fullerton Building restoration project from 1998 to 2000 was a difficult conservation project that involved an institutional building. Architects 61, together with DP Consultants, was engaged to convert it into a 400-room luxury hotel. The hotel rooms were designed by Hirsch Bedner Associates. During its redevelopment, the historical building had most of its special architectural features retained and restored. The conservation work was coordinated by the URA, which had certain stipulations that the new owners had to comply with. Several features of the original building had to be restored faithfully. These included the General Post Office gallery area on the ground floor, with bays that corresponded with the building's towering Doric columns on the façade, and the Straits Club Billiard Room. The post office gallery no longer exists, but has been subdivided to provide a bar, a restaurant and the hotel foyer. The Straits Club Billiard Room was kept, but without its wood panelling. Exterior works The building's neo- classical columns and high-ceiling verandas were retained. It was clad in Shanghai plaster panels, which have been restored. The owners converted the windows back to be housed in timber frames. Part of the tunnel under Fullerton Road, which was used to transfer mail onto ships waiting in the harbour, has also been kept. Interior works While the building's exterior has been conserved, the architects had also to transform the interior into a five-star hotel. The room on the fourth storey, where the British Governor was first told of the British military's decision to surrender to the Japanese during World War II, was converted to an exclusive lounge. The room has a barrel- vaulted, coffered ceiling, which is the only one of its kind in Singapore. Fullerton Lighthouse at Harbour Front Tower The building's historical lighthouse, which used to guide ships into the port, has been incorporated into a food and beverage outlet. The Fullerton Light, a revolving beacon of 540 kilocandelas mounted on the roof of the building, was installed in 1958 to replace the Fort Canning Lighthouse which was being demolished. The beacon could be seen by ships 29 kilometres (15.7 nautical miles) away. The Lighthouse has been moved to a new location as an artefact near Harbour Front Tower. The Fullerton Building was designed for natural ventilation before the age of air-conditioning; one of the architectural devices used to provide this was the internal air-wells. There were four air-wells along the central longitudinal axis, divided by three internal bays of offices, linking the front façade with the rear. It was the largest and the last example of this kind of architecture in Singapore. As air-conditioning became increasingly common, the air-wells became redundant. Two parallel sets of guest rooms now ring the hotel's central triangular sky-lit atrium. One row faces out towards the harbour and the tall buildings of the central business district. The rooms of the inner ring have views of the courtyard in the centre of the building. There is an indoor garden over the old Straits Club at the centre of the atrium which can double as a venue for cocktails. The main entrance into the hotel, where dignitaries and celebrities are received, is covered with a large glass canopy at the porch. Structural and foundation works Construction work in the interior was carried out to reinforce the beams and columns, while retrofitting done on the exterior to restore the façade. Although studies carried out before the renovation work began showed most of the raft foundation was still in good condition, water from the adjacent Singapore River had seeped slowly into some of the foundation's cells over the years, flooding parts of the old basement. As a result, a new precast concrete platform was built over the cells, and waterproofing added. Pillars supporting the entire building now rest on the platform. The engineering team installed a new set of five drainage pumps to counteract the slow seepage of river water. As the building sits on solid rock foundation, no additional piling was required. Gazetting as National Monument The building was officially gazetted on December 7, 2015, as Singapore's 71st national monument, by the country's National Heritage Board (NHB). With its new status, the building will be preserved under the Preservation of Monuments Act. The former Fullerton Building is one of three icons to be given the national monument status this year. The other two are Jurong Town Hall and Istana Kampong Glam. Facilities The Fullerton Hotel Singapore has 400 rooms and suites which either overlook the atrium courtyard, or face downtown Singapore's skyline, the Singapore River promenade or the Marina Bay. The hotel has a 25-metre outdoor infinity swimming pool, fitness centre and a luxury spa. It also has five food and beverage outlets. For business travellers, the hotel has a 24-hour financial centre with the Bloomberg Professional service that provides financial reports and world news, and 15 meeting rooms equipped with conference facilities. Awards The Fullerton Hotel Singapore won the Condé Nast Traveler Gold List award. On 18 July 2001, the hotel received an architectural heritage award from the Urban Redevelopment Authority for its successful restoration of the former Fullerton Building.

Early life Born in the Montenegrin village of Čevo, Milena was a daughter of Vojvoda Petar Vukotić and Jelena Vojvodić born in the village of Viš-Danilovgrad Montenegro. Her father was one of the greatest landowners in Montenegro and a close friend of Vojvoda Mirko Petrović-Njegoš with whom he had fought in the wars of the 1850s.Houston, Nikola & Milena, p. 86 The two friends decided to consolidate their alliance with the union of their children. In 1853, Milena, age only six, was betrothed to Mirkos's only son, Nikola, age twelve. Nikola was the nephew and heir of the childless reigning prince of Montenegro Danilo I. In 1856, after the death of her mother, Milena was sent to Cetinje, to be raised in the household of her future in laws. Having grown up according to the rudimentary customs of Montenegro at that time even in prominent families, Milena was illiterate. Between 1856 and 1860 she grew up in the household of Mirko Njegoš, her soon to be father in law, raised alongside Mirko's daughter, Anastasia. During those four years she became close to her new family: \\"My father and mother loved her as their own daughter\\" wrote later King Nikola. \\"My late uncle (Prince Danilo), also loved her greatly and treated her as his own child, and she showed him her love and respect in every way. She was very beautiful, sweet, kind, gentle and devout.\\"Houston, Nikola & Milena, p. 87 In those years Milena seldom saw her future husband.Houston, Nikola & Milena, p. 85 Six years her senior, Nikola meanwhile was educated first in Trieste and later in Paris. Queen consort The assassination of Prince Danilo, on 12 August 1860, unexpectedly made Nikola the reigning prince of Montenegro at age eighteen. Shortly after, Nikola was close to death ill with pneumonia. When he recovered, it was decided to arrange his marriage as soon as possible in order to provide Montenegro with an heir. Milena's father traveled to St Petersburg and informed Tsar Alexander II of Russia, Montenegro's greatest ally and supporter, of the marriage. On 8 November 1862, at the age of 14, Milena married Prince Nicholas I of Montenegro, then aged 21, who later became King in 1910. The wedding was a simple affair and was held in the Vlach Church in Lovćen valley. The marriage was political: her family had played an important role in Montenegin politics and was befriended with the House of Petrović- Njegoš, her husband's family. Only in her early teens at the time of her marriage, Milena's early years as Princess consort were difficult. She was inexperienced and was a solitary figure initially overshadowed by Princess Darinka, widow of Prince Danilo, who was close to Nikola.Houston, Nikola & Milena, p. 103 During the first four years of her marriage, she did not have any children. She was tutored in the Serbian language and learned French. Milena asserted her position after Darinka left Montenegro for good. In 1865, Milena gave birth to the first of her twelve children. Between 1865 and 1869, she had four daughters in quick succession, with a son and heir, Prince Danilo, born in 1871, and seven more children would follow. Milena's relationship with her husband solidified with time and she became respected and influential. While her husband was away in visits to Austria-Hungary and Russia in the winter of 1868–1869, Milena was in charge of court affairs. She had visited İstanbul with her husband after the invitation of Sultan Abdulhamid in 1899. She was one of the foreigners who had the opportunity to enter the Sultan's harem.Özcan, Uğur. \\"II.

After the annexation by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1918, the royal family was forced into exile. Milena died in France, two years after her husband and was buried in San Remo, Italy. In 1989 her remains, together with her husband's and Xenia's and Vera's, two of her daughters, were transferred to Cetinje and reburied in the Cipur-chapel.

It is made by filming individuals or a group of people lip synching while listening to a song or any recorded audio then dubbing over it in post editing with the original audio of the song. There is often some form of mobile audio device used such as an MP3 player. Often they look like simple music videos, although many involve much preparation and production. Lip dubs are usually done in a single unedited shot that often travel through different rooms and situations within a building. They have become popular with the advent of mass participatory video content sites like YouTube. Origin Although lip dubbing in music videos was not a new concept, Jake Lodwick, the co-founder of Vimeo, coined the term \\"lip dubbing\\" on December 14, 2006, in a video entitled Lip Dubbing: Endless Dream.https://vimeo.com/123498 In the video's description, he wrote, \\"I walked around with a song playing in my headphones, and recorded myself singing. When I got home I opened it in iMovie and added an MP3 of the actual song, and synchronized it with my video. Is there a name for this?

After L'Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) produced a lip dub to The Black Eyed Peas' \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" in 2009, the viral video phenomenon gained international acclaim. The use of camera stabilization hardware is commonly used to provide an easy-to-watch and smooth final product. Content Tom Johnson, a technical writer who blogs about Web 2.0's effect on communication, describes a good lip dub as having the characteristics, or at least the appearance, of spontaneity, authenticity, group participation and fun. Other uses In September 2010, the season première of The Office (\\"Nepotism\\") begins with the workers of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company doing a lip dub of The Human Beinz's \\"Nobody but Me\\" through the office. The record of most people participating at a lip dub is 9,300 on May 31, 2012 in Lindsay, Ontario. The Lindsay LipDub surpassed the previous record of 5,771, which was on October 24, 2010 in the town of Vic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnQV4nwBb_Y The previous record was set to the rhythm of La Flama by the Valencian band Obrint Pas and is called Lipdub per la Independència de Catalunya \\"Lipdub for the Independence of Catalonia\\" The record is not recognised by Guinness. On May 22, 2011, director Rob Bliss and producer Scott Erickson made a video called Grand Rapids Lip Dub in response to a Newsweek article that listed Grand Rapids, Michigan #10 on a list of \\"America's Dying Cities.\\"http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/21/america-s- dying-cities.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPjjZCO67WI The video was labeled by Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times as \\"The greatest music video ever made.\\" The nearly nine-minute video used 5,000 citizens of the city lip- synching to Don McLean's \\"American Pie\\". Released via YouTube on May 26, 2011, the video received over 2 million views in the first week and was the ninth- most-viewed YouTube video on May 28, 2011. Since its 2011 release, the video has been viewed over 5 million times. Similarly, on May 31, 2012, Stratta Creative made a lip dub video called Lindsay LipDub with the goal of becoming Canada's first citywide lip dub, as well as a world record holder for most participants (with 9300 participants), in the community of Lindsay, Ontario. The City of Kawartha Lakes, of which Lindsay is a community, was listed as #188 of 190 cities in Canada by MoneySense, and the community gathered to perform a lip dub, promoted by Rick Mercer, George Stroumboulopoulos, Craig Kielburger, Dan Kanter and Hedley (band).

Classes are taught both in German and English. Primary school is from class 1 - 6, secondary school is from class 7 - 12 or 13. After year 10, students take the middle school exams (Mittlerer Schulabschluss), after which the students have the freedom to choose between the German bilingual Abitur or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. History The Nelson Mandela School was founded in 2000 by the Berlin senate. At this time, the school was still in Lichterfelde and only housed three or four classes. It then moved to Pfalzburger Str. 23 where it stayed for one year before the secondary relocated to Kastanienallee in 2003. The primary remained at Pfalzburger Str. 23. An extension for the primary—a new building directly adjacent to the old one—was constructed in 2007. The school grew rapidly until the secondary saw the need to move again, this time to Pfalzburger Str. 30, just down the road from the primary. This happened in 2011. Until this day, construction on the secondary school yard has not completely ceased. In 2013, an extension of the school, called the NMS-NEO, was founded and moved into a building in another district. This school has only a few classes and officially belongs to the Nelson Mandela, however the purpose of it is to eventually become a different state international and bilingual school. As the old head retired in 2011, 2013 saw the introduction of a new one. Management Both the primary and the secondary school have a head. The primary has a sub-head just for that school. The secondary on the other hand has a deputy head. Otherwise, the management consists of engaged teachers who do this along with teaching. Timetable  Primary  Primary classes commence at 8 a.m. and cease at 4 p.m. Exceptions are Fridays, on which classes generally cease at an earlier time. There is a morning break and a lunch break as well as free-time and SAS lessons (supervised lessons for working independently). Lessons are taught in either German or English, depending on the teacher.  Secondary  Classes at Nelson-Mandela start at 8 a.m. usually, however this can vary depending on the timetable. Particularly in upper secondary, classes can commence at a later time. The lessons are 45 minutes in length, with five-minute breaks in between to allow time for relocating to the next classroom or eating and drinking, for example. Lessons are taught in German or English; this depends on the teacher entirely. Hence, situations can arise when one has a particular subject in German one year and in English the next, or vice versa. However, the school tries very hard to decrease situations like this and is very open when it comes to language issues. There is a fixed 15 minute break from 09:35 to 09:50 and a fixed 20 minute break later in the day from 13:05 to 13:25. Students also have at least one free lunch period every day (or even multiple free lessons for IB and Abitur students). Classes usually cease at 15:50. This can and does vary hugely, however, and some upper secondary students are required to take the 10th lesson, which ends at 16:40, or can leave earlier. Many school clubs and groups meet after school. These meetings vary in length, however they usually do not last longer than 2 hours. Facilities  Secondary The school yard has a basketball court, benches, a running track and a table tennis table and a gym hall, which is equipped with a variety of athletic equipment. There is also the academic library, which not only has computers and laptops but also numerous books, magazines and films on different subjects and the lending library, from which one can lend novels. As to the architecture of the school building, the Nelson-Mandela-School is housed in the old building and the new building, which is reached by crossing the school yard. The former has three floors—the first one contains classrooms, the second one science labs (all science classes are taught here) and two computer rooms, and the third one consists of classrooms, the two music rooms and the Aula, an assembly hall where the school assembles regularly. The ground floor is made up of the canteen, the libraries and the secretary's and principal's office. There is a canteen run by Thomas Beier, an independent cook and caterer, and his assistants. The menu varies daily but always includes a soup, salad, a vegetarian dish and a meat one. The two floors in the new building contain classrooms only; the first one has two art rooms in which all art classes are taught. Two rooms on the first floor are also the offices of the upper secondary coordinators; Mr. Spiller and Mrs. Premkumar for the IB Diploma program and Mr. Mannes for the bilingual Abitur. The ground floor houses the kitchen—for vocational education purposes—and the wood workshop. P.E. classes are taught in the gym adjacent to the school yard, the Wilmersdorfer Sportplatz (which is a short walk away from the school) or occasionally also the nearby Preußenpark. The Nelson Mandela School's yearly Bundesjugendspiele take place at the Stadion Wilmersdorf, located close to S Hohenzollerndamm. Many classrooms are equipped with interactive white-boards, which are digital boards. Each classroom has a computer, which is, if applicable, linked up to the white board. The equipment of the classes varies. Primary The old building of the primary has four floors, on which there are classrooms and one computer room and an art room. The new building contains a science laboratory, a computer room and the \\"Bewegungsraum\\" (the \\"motion room\\", in which dance and drama classes are held). The school also has one music room, a canteen, the Aula (which can be used for sports classes as well as assemblies) and the \\"Foyer\\". There is a library. There are two school yards, a larger one containing a variety of different objects like a football court, table tennis tables or a slide, and the \\"Chill Hof\\" (\\"chill yard\\"), which is considerably smaller. As in the secondary, in the primary there are interactive white- boards in the classrooms, but this varies.

In 1948, just two years after its founding by Sigvart Steen, a Luther College alumnus, a young Weston Noble began a 57-year tenure as music director and conductor. Together, Noble and The Nordic Choir cultivated the Lutheran collegiate choral traditions in the United States. Eventually five more choirs were added to the music program to accommodate the growing interest in choral music and voice at Luther. In 2005, Luther College named Craig Arnold to the position of Director of Choral Activities and conductor of the Nordic Choir following Noble’s retirement. Arnold held the position from 2005-2010. Allen Hightower was appointed conductor effective Fall 2010 and left for University of North Texas in 2016. The current conductor is Andrew Last, Luther College alumnus, class of 1997. The Nordic Choir tours annually throughout the United States and has appeared at many of the major concert halls and music centers in the United States, including Lincoln Center, New York City; the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C.; Orchestra Hall, Chicago; Orchestra Hall and the Historic State Theater, Minneapolis; the Ordway Music Theater, St. Paul, Minnesota; Walt Disney Concert Hall, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Crystal Cathedral, Los Angeles; and the historic Mormon Tabernacle, Salt Lake City. The choir also has been featured in three international television broadcasts of The Hour of Power and on four national convention programs of the American Choral Directors Association. Every third year the choir tours internationally. The Nordic Choir has made numerous concert tours of Europe, the Caribbean, Mexico, Russia, and Eastern Europe. During its 1994 tour of Russia and Eastern Europe, the Nordic Choir performed in Tchaikovsky Hall, Moscow, and the Franz Liszt Academy, Budapest, and shared a concert in St. Petersburg’s Philharmonic Hall with the St. Petersburg Conservatory Choir. The Nordic Choir returned to Russia and Eastern Europe in 1997 on a tour that included performances with the Moscow Chamber Orchestra. In 2000 and 2003, the choir honored the college’s roots with tours to Norway and Scandinavia. In 2006, the Nordic Choir toured Europe with concerts in Italy, Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic. In May and June 2009, the Nordic Choir returned to Europe with concerts in Italy, France, and Spain, and in May 2012, the choir toured the British Isles. In 2015, the choir toured Italy, and in 2018 returned to Germany to see the sites of the college's namesake Martin Luther. Closer to home, the choir appears frequently on campus in concerts, worship services and at \\"Christmas at Luther,\\" the college's annual Christmas concert series, alongside the Luther College Symphony Orchestra and five other Luther choirs. In the fall of 2006, the Nordic Choir released its first CD under the direction of Craig Arnold, The Road Home, that joined the extensive library of recordings highlighting the Noble choral legacy.

It was said to have derived its name from the wife of Electryon, and was celebrated as the residence of Electryon and the birthplace of his daughter Alcmena.Schol. ad Pind. Ol. 7.49.

Strabo describes Midea as near Tiryns; and from its mention by Pausanias, in connection with the Heraeum and Tiryns, it must be placed on the eastern edge of the Argeian plain; but the only clue in the ancient authors to its exact position is the statement of Pausanias, who says that, returning from Tiryns into the road leading from Argos to Epidaurus, \\"you will reach Mideia on the left.\\" Site and remains Remains of Midea.

The book was published in 2007, and was shortlisted for both the Costa Children's Book Award and the Carnegie Medal.The CILIP Carnegie Medal & Kate Greenaway Children's Book Awards Plot introduction What I Was tells the story of a secret friendship between two teenagers, one an unhappy public schoolboy and the other living an independent and isolated life on the beach near the school. It is set on the East Anglian coast in 1962. Plot summary The book is framed as the reminiscence of an old man recalling the year he discovered love. It is written as a first-person narrative. The novel opens with the protagonist, Hilary, a sixteen-year-old boy arriving at a grim East Anglian boarding school in 1962 after being twice expelled from previous institutions. He has no interest in study, no aptitude for sports and a great dislike of both pupils and teachers. He compares the school to a prison and finds life there unbearable. While slacking on a school cross-country run, he meets Finn, who lives alone in a beachside shack and sustains himself by fishing and working at the market. Hilary thinks Finn has an ideal life, and admires and envies him. He begins to visit the silent, enigmatic boy, and they are able to spend some afternoons together. He lies to his parents and the school so that he can stay at the shack during the Easter holidays. On one visit to Finn, Hilary realizes his friend is ill, and suspects he may have given the other boy glandular fever, which had spread through the school several weeks before. He tries to look after Finn himself but after a while becomes frightened and calls the emergency services. Finn runs away from the shack but Hilary later finds him in hospital. Both schoolboys and adults misunderstand the innocent nature of their friendship, particularly when it is discovered that Finn is only fourteen, two years younger than Hilary, and is actually a girl, biologically. He leaves the school and does not see Finn again for many years. Eventually he returns to the coast, stays in Finn's by then abandoned shack, and realizes his dream of \\"becoming\\" Finn. References to history and geography There are frequent references to the Dark Ages, the period being taught at the school. The teacher stresses the battles and the brutality, which appeal to most of his students, but Finn's primitive life at the hut represents the austere self-sufficiency of the period, which appeals to Hilary. The sinking of England's eastern coastline is also often mentioned. The sunken city and Roman fort are the focus of a sailing expedition in the earlier part of the book. Later in the same year, Finn's shack becomes flooded. In the closing chapter, set in the mid-21st century, the old man's boat passes over the school, now completely consumed by the rising sea.

The Roxbury Historic Trust acts as curator for these Roxbury Township owned buildings. They were purchased by the Township with Green Acres funding. The buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 29, 1994 for their significance in commerce from 1815 to 1928. Both were later added as contributing properties to the Ledgewood Historic District on April 18, 2013. History The King Store is a 2½ story building built of rubble stone in 1815 by Woodruff and Hopkins. At the ground floor its walls are 3 feet thick. Originally it had white stucco walls with green shutters and door. The Woodruff family operated the store until 1835. For approximately two years it lay abandoned and was home to wandering goats and sheep. In 1837 Albert Riggs (son of Silas Riggs, a tanner by trade and owner of several canal boats) acquired the building and reopened it as a general store serving the community and the Morris Canal trade. For many years it also served as Post Office and its owner as Postmaster. The Store was located 150 feet from the Morris Canal Basin. Theodore king, the son-in-law of Albert Riggs, took over the Store in 1873. He lived on the second floor of the building with his wife and daughter. By 1881, Mr King had built a residence on adjacent property and then began a renovation of the Store, changing the decor to Greek revival and the color scheme to creme with brown trim. In the process, the exterior was given a smooth coat of stucco which was scored to resemble large blocks. The interior of the Store was given an Italianate design with a cream and maroon color scheme. The Roxbury Rotary restored and stabilized the building by early 2000 and then began work on the Homestead. Architecture King Homestead at 209 Main Street The King Homestead, a vernacular frame house to start, had several additions with Italianate and Queen Anne influenced detailing. It is possible that the original house may just have consisted of the current parlor, Exhibit Rooms 1 and 2, one or both staircases to the second floor, on which there were two front bedrooms (current RHT Office and Conference Room) and a smaller bedroom at the rear. There were stairs to the basement which contained the kitchen (basement kitchens were common in Victorian homes). The dumb waiter was probably moved to its present location when the dining room was added, so that food could be brought up from the kitchen below. The final additions to the home were probably the circular first floor office used by Mr. King then later by Louse King, and a rear first floor kitchen. Of artistic interest is the four wall, oil on canvas, dining room mural. It was painted by James William Marland in 1936. It was both signed and dated by the artist. Visiting Both Museums are opened the second Sunday of each month (except January) from 1 to 4 pm.

There are Saxon burial mounds on the site and they are a Scheduled Monument Today, with wooded areas and wide open fields, Banstead Downs are predominately used for walks by local residents. The downs also form a pathway from Belmont Village and Brighton Road to Banstead. History Archaeological finds on Banstead Downs include Roman and Iron Age pottery and Bronze Age axes. Saxon bowl barrows have been found at the \\"Gally Hills\\" site to the west of Brighton Road. The name Gally Hills possibly indicates the former position of a gallows and a gibbet is said to have stood nearby. The northernmost barrow of the remaining Gally Hill barrows was excavated during May 1972, after extensive damage, and was thought to contain the remains of a Saxon warrior. Other secondary burials, in which were found two intact skeletons with dislocated necks, suggest that gallows victims were also buried nearby. The Downs have long formed a largely open grass chalkland attraction, physically separated since the early 20th century by housing at Burgh Heath from their neighbouring geographical continuation, Epsom Downs. It is a section of the North Downs which is not so eroded or indented as elsewhere on the Downs and marks a relatively abrupt rise of the tall North Downs less than from the City of London. Banstead Downs are still a wide extent of open land, though much reduced since the time when they made one unbroken expanse with Epsom Downs; the old four mile racecourse ran from a point between Banstead village and the railway station into the present 'straight' of Epsom racecourse. Banstead Downs are recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086, when they were the property of Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror.Noticeboard on Banstead Downs Gally Hills The Downs, now appropriated chiefly for golf, formerly fed sheep in abundance. The old inn in Banstead village, a building which may well date from the 17th century, is called the 'Wool Pack,' a survival of a past trade. In 1324 the Abbot of Chertsey impleaded John de la Lane, bailiff to Isabella the Queen at Banstead, and others, for taking 1,500 of his sheep at Evesham (Epsom), driving them to Banstead and imparking (i.e. impounding) them, until some died from want of food. The bailiff answered that he took them on Banstead Down by way of distress as the abbot had been impleaded for trespass in the queen's manorial court at Banstead, but had not answered. In the king's court, to which the case was transferred, the abbot obtained damages. In 1338 it was ordered that the officers taking wool for purveyance should exact none from the queen's (Philippa's) manors of Witley and Banstead. The high quality of the wool is shown by a petition of the House of Commons in 1454, in which they prayed that a sack of wool of the growth of Banstead Down might not be sold for less than 100 shillings, as the price of such wool was greatly decayed. The reputation of Banstead Downs for sheep is referred to by Alexander Pope in his Imitations of Horace, and by others. Historically Banstead Downs were the scene of sport. The sheep-cropped Downs turf and dry chalky subsoil adapted itself admirably to sporting pursuits; vast crowds assembled for foot and horse races, prize fights, wrestling, hawking and hunting. Sutton was the nearest place providing refreshments for animals and man; there was no water on the Downs. Royal horses were stabled at Belmont, where also a range of training stables existed. Nonsuch Palace in the near proximity supplied its quota of royal visitors, and the Royal Hare Warren on the Downs was visited by at least four kings. When the Earl of Holland's ill-contrived royalist rising of 1648 took place at Kingston, the original plan had included a muster of adherents, as for a horse race, on Banstead Downs. Rumour was rife at the time of such an assembly being formed, and that Holland had marched thither from Kingston. But in fact he had marched to Dorking, and Major Audeley, who was on his track, went over Banstead Downs without finding him or the assembly. The rising had in fact exploded prematurely. There is evidence of races at Banstead as early as 1625, when the Banstead Downs Plate of £20 value was run on 24 August of that year. A notable footrace was run in 1663, and a famous prize-fight is recorded in 1669. When the great question of the exclusion of James, Duke of York from the succession was before the House of Lords, in 1678, the Duke of Ormonde wrote to Colonel Cooke that he tried to delay the first reading by pointing out the thinness of the House owing to a Dog Match at Hampton Court, and a Horse Match on Banstead Downs. He himself did not attend the Horse Match, where 12 horses ran for 3 plates, 'owners up,' apparently, but he sent a description of it. Two horses fell, one nearly killing his jockey, and it was reported that \\"the Duke of Monmouth escaped narrowly,\\" so apparently he was also riding. Hares and partridges were also preserved on the Downs. Henry Saunders was made keeper of a portion of the Downs at £30 a year under The Protectorate, as a reward for trying to seize a highwayman, and in 1668 a gamekeeper was appointed by the Duchy of Lancaster, at the same salary, to preserve hares and partridges. In 1669 the King (Charles II) was hawking there, it not being then the custom to shoot partridges. The Downs were also used as a muster-place for the Surrey Militia in 1670, when an inspection of the troops was made by the King and Prince Rupert. The formation of a camp of the regular army under the Duke of York or the Duke of Monmouth was discussed in 1678, but it is uncertain whether the plan was carried out. Track on Banstead Downs During the 17th and 18th centuries, Banstead Downs gained notoriety for the number of highwaymen who lurked there to attack wealthy people enjoying the Downs, attending the races, going to the fashionable spa town of Epsom or travelling from London to Brighton. In July 1731, The Grub- Street Journal reported: In another account of a more successful robbery from May 1735: Features The Downs is one of four green areas in the area, which are overall referred to as Banstead Commons. The other areas are Burgh Heath (87 acres), Banstead Heath (760 acres) and Park Downs (74 acres). These areas were the focus of a protracted legal battle in the 19th century. Banstead Downs is home to the rare small blue butterfly.Walk London with audio clip See also *List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Surrey References External links  *Banstead Commons Conservators Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Surrey ","title":"Banstead Downs"},{"id":"13065385","text":"Blackheath is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest south-east of Guildford in Surrey.

It is part of the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area. Two nature reserves which are managed by the Surrey Wildlife Trust are in the SSSI, Barossa nature reserve and Poors Allotment. Broadmoor Bottom, which is part of Wildmoor Heath, also falls within the SSSI; this reserve is managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. Environment This area has an extensive mosaic of broadleaved woodland, coniferous plantation, dry and wet heathland, valley mire, a series of base-poor ponds and a scarce breeding invertebrate assemblage (topsoil and plants). In particular, the heathland and coniferous plantation supports internationally important populations of woodlark, Eurasian nightjar and Dartford warbler, and have a nationally important dragonfly and damselfly population. The site includes the peatland valley bogs of Broadmoor Bottom and Wishmoor Bottom which form the most important remaining examples of this type of habitat in the region. The site encloses a variety of habitats, but especially some open heathland as well as forestry plantations. The underlying geology includes recent deposits such as the Barton sands, part of the Bagshot Formation with local gravel deposits. They form a well-drained subsoil, so the area is mainly dry. Pockets of clay near the surface result in relatively shallow, sheltered pools. Adjoining forest and military use The area is partly used by Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst and is partially within Swinley Forest, the main woodland of Bracknell Forest district. Bird life The Hobby, a drawing by Jos Zwarts The mixture of open heathland, some valley bottom bogs and woodland provides habitats for heathland birds including the stonechat Saxicola torquata, common redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, and three particularly vulnerable species of bird, woodlark Lullula arborea, nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus and Dartford warbler Sylvia undata. The site also has a small breeding population of the hobby Falco subbuteo. Forestry management of the coniferous woodland, which includes rotational clearance and subsequent replanting, provides temporary areas of developing heathland. These areas, together with open storm damaged areas and the developing heathland alongside broad forest rides, are utilised as breeding habitat by woodlark, the Hobby (bird) and nightjar. They have expanded as Sitka spruce plantations have been cut down, such as in and around Caesar's Camp. Archaeology Bank and ditch at Caesar's Camp One feature of note within the area is an Iron Age hill fort called Caesar's Camp. It is one of the largest hillforts in the south of England, but has not been excavated systematically. Some of the coniferous woodland has been cleared from the site, enabling greater visibility of the massive earthworks of the ramparts. It has produced a few Iron Age coins. An important Roman road, the Devil's Highway (Roman Britain) also cuts across the woods and heathland from east to west, leading to the Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum. It is also linked to the Iron Age fort by a short road which cuts through a small Roman settlement known as Wickham Bushes. The site has produced random scatters of pottery, tiles, nails and brick, as well as Samian ware, suggesting it may have been a staging post on the road, but again, has never been excavated scientifically. There are also numerous redoubts made by soldiers practicing engineering skills during the Napoleonic wars.

Paired opposites in the proportions of units  Scalar ranges and coordinate systems are paired opposites within sets. Incorporating dimensions of positive and negative numbers and exponents, or expanding x, y and z coordinates, by adding a fourth dimension of time allows a resolution of position relative to the standard of the scale which is often taken as 0,0,0,0 with additional dimensions added as referential scales are expanded from space and time to mass and energy. Ancient systems frequently scaled their degree of opposition by rate of increase or rate of decrease. Linear increase was enhanced by doubling systems. An acceleration in the rate of increase or decrease could be analyzed arithmetically, geometrically, or through a wide range of other numerical and physical analysis. Arithmetic and geometric series, and other methods of rating proportionate expansion or contraction could be thought of as convergent or divergent toward a position. Though unit quantities were first defined by spatial dimensions, and then expanded by adding coordinates of time, the weight or mass a given spatial dimension could contain was also considered and even in antiquity, conditions under which the standard would be established such as at a given temperature, distance from sea level, or density were added. Rates of change over time were then considered as either indexes of production or depletion  Paired opposites as rhetorical device Paired opposites are used as poetic diction meaning \\"everything\\". Common phrases incorporated paired opposites in English include \\"all creatures great and small,\\" \\"working for the man every night and day,\\" \\"more things in heaven and Earth\\" \\"searching high and low\\" \\"in sickness and in health\\". In Greek literature, Homer uses the device when he lets Telemachus say, \\"I know all things, the good and the evil\\" (Od.20:309-10). The same phrase is used in Hebrew in text of Genesis, referring to the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil.Harry Orlinsky's notes to the NJPS Torah. Conjugate Variables In quantum mechanics, as well as some fields of mathematics, conjugate variables are a form of paired opposites, in which knowledge of one precludes knowledge of the other. A standard example is the relation between position (x) and momentum (p), which can be expressed in terms of the uncertainty principle as \\\\Delta p \\\\Delta x \\\\geq \\\\hbar.

Ben Oss () is a Scottish mountain situated in the Stirling Council area, six kilometres south west of the village of Tyndrum within the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park.  Overview  Ben Oss reaches a height of 1029 metres (3376 feet) and qualifies as a Munro and a Marilyn. It stands in a group of hills in the Cononish glen to the west of Tyndrum which consists of three other Munros (Ben Lui, Beinn Dubhchraig and Beinn a' Chleibh) and the Corbett Beinn Chùirn. When viewed from the north or south it is seen as a distinct pointed hill in contrast to its more bulky neighbour Beinn Dubhchraig, with which it is usually climbed. The mountain is quite rocky and craggy being composed of mica schist rock.\\"Hamish‘s Mountain Walk\\" Pages 80 (Gives geology). The hills name has two possible meanings in the Gaelic with guide books being divided on the subject. “Os” can mean an elk or a loch outlet, with a lochan and a stream with the same name in the immediate vicinity it implies that the area around Ben Oss was where elk were found before they were hunted to extinction.\\"The Magic of the Munros\\" Pages 15 (Gives details of name translation).  Geography  Ben Oss is especially craggy on its northern face, falling away steeply to the Cononish glen and barring any direct approach from this direction. It has two main ridges which connect to the adjacent Munros of Ben Lui and Beinn Dubhchraig and walkers usually arrive at the mountains summit along either of these. One ridge goes north east, east and then south east to form a curving edge around Coire Garbh connecting to Beinn Dubhchraig at the Bealach Buidhe with a height of 779 metres. Coire Garbh has Loch Oss lying within its recesses, a body of water measuring roughly 500 by 300 metres. Coire Buidhe stands on the northern side of this eastern ridge, this has a steep headwall and descents north from the bealach to the Cononish glen are not recommended.\\"The Munros\\" Page 20 (Details steepness of Coire Buidhe). Ben Oss’s other ridge goes south west to a col at the head of Coire Laoigh with a height of 687 metres which links to Ben Lui. Ben Oss’ southern slopes drop less steeply to Glen Falloch and the land at the head of Loch Lomond. Ben Oss lies on the drainage divide of Scotland, all rainfall that falls on the northern slopes drains to the Cononish glen which forms the headwaters of the River Tay and eventually goes to the east coast. Drainage from the southern slopes goes via Glen Falloch and Loch Lomond to reach the sea at the west coast at the Firth of Clyde. Ben Oss alongside Ben Lui stand at the head of Glen Fyne, a contuation of the sea loch, Loch Fyne at 40 miles long in Argyll and Bute.  Ascents  Because of a lack of good access paths from the south (Glen Falloch), Ben Oss is usually climbed from the area just south of Tyndrum, with the usual start being at Dalrigh (grid reference ) on the A82 road. Many guide books recommend climbing Ben Oss with Beinn Dubhchraig from Dalrigh and this allows for a less steep approach over Dubhchraig and then continuing to Ben Oss via the Bealach Buidhe. A circular walk around the head of the Cononish glen can be continued over Ben Lui and Beinn Chuirn to finish again at Dalrigh.\\"The Munros\\" Page 20 (Gives details of ascents). The summit of the mountain is flattish and the medium size cairn stands on an area of large slabby rocks interspersed with grass. The summit has a prominence of 342 metres and gives a fine vista of the southern highlands, it is a good place to admire the craggy eastern face of neighbouring Ben Lui.

It premiered at the Montreal World Film Festival on August 31, 2007, and was scheduled for a theatrical release sometime in 2007. It is directed by Scott Flynn and stars Belgian actor Patrick Bauchau as Albert Fish. Plot At St. John's Orphanage in 1882, children, including a young Albert Fish, are being paddled as punishment for their sins. Albert Fish as an adult (Patrick Bauchau) then tells an anecdote of a horse that some older boys at the orphanage set on fire, comparing himself to the horse. He regularly whips himself with a belt while hallucinating himself as he appeared in the orphanage. Fish kills a boy scout, Francis McDonnell, before visiting the Budd family home, where he abducts and murders ten-year-old Grace Budd (Lexi Ainsworth) on June 3, 1928 under the pretense of taking her to his niece's birthday party. Throughout the film is a film noir-style narration by Detective William King (Jack Conley), of the Missing Persons Bureau. King searches for Grace Budd for six years, before finally tracking down and arresting Fish. Fish is found guilty despite evidence of his insanity, and promptly sentenced to die in the electric chair. Cast Main * Patrick Bauchau as Albert Fish * Jack Conley as Det.

It is presented by Richard Bacon and features members of the public demonstrating specific skills. Each week ordinary members of the public take tests in certain fields or skills to identify any previously unidentified talent, and those that test highest in each area are trained by experts to maximise their potential in that skill. 900 people applied and were tested for the show.  Episode 1  Air date: 24 April 2012 Maggie Reenan, 45, a nurse and grandmother, is found to have a talent for rock climbing. She climbs the 200 ft Old Man of Stoer, a sea stack which can only be reached by swimming or a Tyrolean traverse across the sea. Meanwhile, Brenda Chamberlain, 63, a former bridal boutique owner, has the highest test results in lie detection, with an 80% success rate. After a two-day course in interrogation techniques run by former FBI agents in America, she detects which one of five people is not telling the truth, despite each being adept at lying. Episode 2 Air date: 1 May 2012 Roxanne Messenger, 28, an art director at an advertising agency, is selected to master the skill of freediving. Trainer Emma Farrell tested the 900 applicants on their natural abilities to equalize the pressure in their ears and to hold their breath while walking and maintaining a normal heart- rate. Messenger was then sent to Egypt to train under free-diving instructor Marco Nones. Meanwhile, tractor factory worker Lee Yenson, who had no formal art training, was chosen to learn how to identify forged masterpieces. He tests extremely well in the area of aesthetic appreciation, and is trained by Professor Matthew Kieran. In his final test he is asked to identify a genuine Monet from a room of fakes, some of which were painted by famous forger John Myatt.  Episode 3  Air date: 8 May 2012 A homeless 19-year-old, James Whinnery from Birmingham, learns the Arabic language in 19 weeks. Whinnery has been living in a homeless shelter since an argument with his mother, and has failed to complete his A-Level exams. However, after a test involving working in a Turkish-speaking restaurant for a day after only a day's training in the language, he is identified as having a natural ability to learn foreign languages. His training includes learning 100 new Arabic words per day as well as a new alphabet, driving around London using an Arabic satellite navigation system, and ordering in an Arabic restaurant. He then travels to Jordan, where he is interviewed on Jordanian breakfast television.  Episode 4  Air date: 15 May 2012 Adele Reah, 26, a science teacher, is chosen by neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers from 500 people for her natural ability to navigate in the wilderness without a map or compass. Despite ambitions in her earlier life to join the RAF, Reah had been rejected both from a flight career and a navigation career on the grounds that her arms were too short, and so missed out on a career where her natural ability would have been particularly useful. Meanwhile, Jayson Khun-Dkar, a 34-year-old charity contracts manager, is selected by musical director Stuart Barr as having the potential to become an opera singer. He trains for five months to become a baritone, taking singing lessons and learning Italian, in order to audition for a production of La Boheme.  Episode 5  Air date: 22 May 2012 Cassie Gledhill, a 27-year-old track cyclist, is found to have the highest test scores ever seen by tester Professor David Strayer in the area of multitasking. Over three days she undertakes an intensive course in ambulance dispatching, a course that usually takes three weeks to complete. She must then co-ordinate emergency calls and ambulance crews on a busy Friday night in Birmingham. Meanwhile, three people are selected as having an exceptional ability for facial recognition. They are taken to Liverpool Street Station, where they must memorise the faces of 15 identically-dressed actors amongst the crowds. They then have to pick them out from an identity parade afterwards.  Critical reception  Hidden Talent received mixed reviews. Zoe Williams in The Guardian praised its premise, saying: \\"I think Hidden Talent (Channel 4) may turn out to be a rare – possibly unique – instance in which a programme started out as a high concept in a meeting room, and then ended up being much much better than the idea.\\" and \\"...there is in human nature this unshakeable joy in watching other people be good at things.\\" She also praised presenter Richard Bacon, who she says is: \\"quietly charismatic, with his solemn manners, salt-and-pepper hair and whatever the opposite is of a poker face.\\" However, Ceri Radford in The Daily Telegraph found it uncomfortable that the show had been \\"'inspired' by, rather than simply 'sponsored by', an international credit card firm.\\" She also criticised its predictable format, admitting \\"...a certain weary sense of inevitability. It was justified: within eight minutes, one of the contenders was weeping with the emotion of it all, within nine, there was a dragging, manufactured attempt at suspense as the unlucky were eliminated, and within 11, there was the usual desultory home visit to misty-eyed relatives.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2010s British television series Category:2012 British television series debuts Category:Channel 4 original programming Category:British reality television series ","title":"Hidden Talent"},{"id":"13065743","text":"Chemical sensitivity may refer to: * Multiple chemical sensitivity, a chronic increase in sensitivity to common chemicals * Food intolerance, a negative reaction to chemical components in the diet * Drug intolerance or drug sensitivity, a lower threshold to the normal pharmacologic action of a drug, not to be confused with drug allergy.

He received a Bachelor of Arts from Yale in 1835 and a Master of Arts thereafter. He graduated from Washington University with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1838 and began practicing in Baltimore. He moved to practice in Easton in 1843. He was Professor of Medical Jurisprudence at the Philadelphia College of Medicine from 1848 to 1849 and became Professor of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children in 1849. In 1857 and 1857 Cox was president of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland. In 1861 he became a surgeon in the United States Army, leaving in 1862. Cox served as the first Lieutenant Governor of Maryland from 1865 to 1868. The relatively new office was abolished in 1868 and not reinstated until 1970, upon which the next lieutenant governor, Blair Lee III, was elected. Re-creation of the office involved an amendment to the Maryland Constitution of 1867, which had superseded the 1864 constitution under which the office was initially established. Trinity College conferred an LL. D. on Cox in 1867, and in 1869 became Professor of Medical Jurisprudence at Georgetown University. He was editor of the National Medical Journal in Washington, D.C. from 1870 to 1872, and also assistant editor of the Baltimore Patriot. Cox was one of the founders of the Literary Society of Washington in 1874. An Episcopalian, he died in Washington D.C.

Along with many other countries of the Caribbean, they use the East Caribbean dollar as their official currency, which was first brought into circulation in 1965 to replace the British West Indies dollar. Even though Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver pieces of eight (Spanish dollars and later Mexican dollars) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century. Britain adopted the gold standard in 1821 and an imperial order-in-council of 1838 resulted in Antigua formally adopting the sterling currency on 13 January 1847. However, despite the circulation of British silver coins in Antigua, the silver pieces of eight continued to circulate alongside them, and the private sector continued to use dollar accounts for reckoning. The international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in Antigua in the wake of this crisis for fear that a silver standard might return. Even though the British sterling coins were made of silver, they were fractional coins of the British gold sovereign and hence they maintained their gold value. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. From 1949, with the introduction of the British West Indies dollar, the currency of Antigua became officially tied up with that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. The fixed exchange rate of $4.80 = £1 sterling (equivalent to the old $1 = 4s 2d) continued right up until 1976. Banknotes Three banks, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Colonial Bank and Barclays Bank, all issued 5 dollars notes. The Royal Bank of Canada issued notes between 1913 and 1938, whilst the Colonial Bank issued notes in 1926 and Barclays Bank (which took over the Colonial Bank) issued notes between 1937 and 1940.

On July 21, 2011, the Earth Eternal website was reopened and the game was scheduled to be released in North America in Summer 2011. As of November 24, 2011 at 9 PM EST, the game and website once again went offline for an indefinite period of time. Screenshot of Bremen town Setting The game takes place in the future, after modern human civilization has fallen and been replaced with a civilization of anthropomorphic animal races. In the game's world, humanity was preceded on Earth by a series of magical civilizations. This background information is referred to as \\"Lore\\" on the game's website, which provides both a summary of the fictional history and a comprehensive, 145-page pdf version. In this story, the history of Earth is divided into four periods: the Lost Ages, the Age of Legend, the Age of Man, and the Age of Beasts. During the Lost Ages, Earth was ruled by the Titan Kronos and his wife Helga. Their subjects included many races, but primarily the Faerie, who eventually rebelled. The Faerie leader, Agalarna, was exiled into space on a comet. During the subsequent millennia, a malevolent being called Djall, also known as the Dark Lord, attached itself to Agalarna. When the comet returned to Earth, Djall came to the planet and tricked the Titans into entering a portal to the plane of Tartarus in pursuit of greater power. He then sealed the portal, trapping them and leaving him locked in a struggle with Gaia, the lone Titan to not fall for his ruse. Over a period of aeons, the Godwars were fought. Gaia released the Gods, children of the Titans who had been in hibernation, to fight against Djall. Life on Earth was nearly destroyed and the Faerie hid themselves away in a refuge called Otherworld. Gaia, the Gods, and Djall reached an accord to wage their conflict only through intermediaries, ending the Lost Ages. During the subsequent Age of Legend, Djall created Salamanzar to lead his Undead hordes while Gaia greeted the Beasts, a large number of races that resembled various animals. Among the evil races they fought were the Dvergar. Eight Beasts became particularly powerful mages and were called the Mystarchs. The Mystarchs discovered an evil force called the Shadow Legion and attempted to unite Beasts in opposition to it. However, the rule of the Mystarchs became oppressive and the Beasts rebelled, executing or exiling the Mystarchs and instead uniting under the leadership of the judge Solomon. The following twenty-three generations constituted a golden era during which all Beast races lived in peace and culture flourished under the rule of Solomon's descendants. However, the peace was shattered by the invasion of the Primals, who stormed Europe from over the Western Sea. They were repelled only through the intervention of the Faerie, who subsequently returned to Otherworld. Vinga, the first Vampire, then rebelled against Salamanzar and established the Blood Kingdom in Eastern Europe. Salamanzar was killed in the course of his campaign to retake Vinga's domain, and Vinga became the ruler of Europe. During the two-thousand-year \\"Bleakness,\\" only a stronghold in the Great Forest in Western Europe remained free of Undead rule. A hero, Atan, then arose. Of an unknown Beast race, Atan learned magical arts in the Far East and returned to Europe with his followers, freeing Europe from Vinga. However, the People of the Skull and the Dvergar remained as threats. The Age of Legend ended when one Beast was slain by other Beasts, ending their covenant. The murderers became Mankind, beginning the Age of Man. Gaia, seeing that Man would come to dominate Earth, hid the Beasts outside of reality in areas called Groves. Millennia later, Mankind declared war upon itself. Over the course of a few decades, Man's cities were destroyed and the environment was badly damaged. The Gods persuaded the ancient race of the Maar to cleanse the atmosphere, but in the process the Maar became the monstrous Goliaths. In a process called the Reclamation, the Beasts returned to Earth, starting the Age of Beasts. The game takes place in Europe, about two millennia into the Age of Beasts. Development and Closing Development on Earth Eternal began 2006, but would not be announced until January 10, 2007. CEO and Founder of Iron Realms Entertainment (IRE) Matt Mihaly, announced the founding of a sister company of IRE, called Sparkplay Media, with the intention of creating a free MMORPG with the ability to be played through a web browser. Additionally, Earth Eternal’s system would be entirely microtransaction based, which had just begun to be accepted in the West. Mihaly would leave as CEO of IRE to become CEO of Sparkplay Media. Earth Eternal was initially scheduled for release in the summer of 2007, however, as a result of a substantial increase in funding [over $4 million from Redpoint Ventures and Prism Ventureworks] its release was changed to sometime in 2009. Questing party at night in Bremen town As of April 2009, approximately 40 chapters of the history had been released, along with 22 male and female anthropomorphic races. In addition, the classes were tentatively released. On February 2, 2009, Sparkplay Media released a new website. The new website contained improved features and more information than the older website, as well as new videos and information. On May 18, 2009, Earth Eternal announced the beginning of its closed Beta phase. A newsletter was sent out, inviting the recipients to take a brief survey and thereby put themselves in the pre-selection pool of beta testers. On July 14, 2009, Sparkplay Media released a Fansite Kit to the public. The fansite kit included Logos, Avatars, Images of the Playable Races, Concept Art, Screen Shots, a Fact Sheet, FAQ, and a Getting Started Guide. On Oct. 7, 2009, Earth Eternal went into open beta. On August 8, 2010, Matt Mihaly, CEO of Sparkplay Media, announced that the company was out of funds and all but himself and another unnamed employee had been laid off and that the future of the game was uncertain. Mihaly had been trying to sell Sparkplay Media for the two months prior to the announcement, however he could find no buyers. Sparkplay Media was put up for auction on August 8, and was purchased on the 17th by TurnOut Ventures. Earth Eternal remained online after the purchase by TurnOut until August 31, 2010, where it was shut down due to non-payment to their internet service provider. When TurnOut Ventures purchased Earth Eternal they inherited Sparkplay Media's contractual obligations to the Japanese publisher, Sankando, to create a localized version of Earth Eternal for the Japanese market. This Japanese version of Earth Eternal, called Ikimonogatari, was announced on April 11, 2011 and was officially launched on July 5, 2011. By July 2011, American players could once again log into Earth Eternal, now called Earth Eternal Reborn (EER), headed by the developer TurnOut Ventures. This was a limited beta test of the new game client and servers, though some major changes to the game took place. To log in, users had to utilize their Facebook accounts, through which provided the only access to log into Earth Eternal. Additionally, all user characters and data had been deleted before the re- launch of Earth Eternal, much to the dismay of many former players who had spent money on micro transactions for their previous characters. Furthermore, Japanese models were used for the playable characters, appearing quite different from their previously released counterparts. Open Beta for EER was officially started on August 9, 2011. On October 31, 2011, the Japanese Earth Eternal (Ikimonogatari) website was taken down, and it was announced on the (North American) Earth Eternal Reborn forms that development had been put on indefinite hold and EER's development team at TurnOut had been relocated to other projects. Earth Eternal Reborn remained online, though the cash shop had been closed. On November 20, 2011, the English Earth Eternal Facebook page stated that as of November 24, 2011 at 9pm EST the game would be closing, without a known date if or when the game would be playable again. Gameplay Earth Eternal is a free massively multiplayer online role-playing game. It is comparable to RuneScape and Achaea as it shares many gameplay elements with these games. The game is free to play, with the option of players to purchase in-game content with real money; though everything that can be bought with real money can also be gotten for free by playing longer, essentially making payment a faster way to level up, obtain items and advance in the game. The 22 Player races, while they look drastically different, will not have any racial differences among them. This means that a Clockwork, Foxen, and Fangren will all start with the same stats, and none will have an advantage in any area when they begin the game. The reason for this was because the game developers wanted a player to be able to choose any race they wanted, without any handicap or penalty for specializing in a particular class.Earth Eternal preview, gamepro.com, 9/2/09. Player versus player combat system is included in the game. It consists of several arenas scattered throughout the major cities. Players can enter the arena at any time and battle other participants currently inside. There is no penalty for dying in the arena. Additionally, most of the game does not have loading zones, but rather be contiguous for most of the map, except in some far-flung areas of the map and underground areas. The game will have a 'soft level cap', so a player can theoretically gain infinite levels, though as the player progresses, it will take more experience points before they level up, such that eventually it may take years to gain another level. Lastly, there will be no 'death penalty' in terms of gold, items, or experience. When a player dies, depending on the option they choose, they can lose coins, or take temporary health and stat loss. They also lose \\"Heroism\\", which is a bar that affects luck, item drops, extra HP, and which is filled through killing monsters. Classes Earth Eternal features four playable classes: Druid, Knight, Mage, and Rogue. The player can choose one of the four classes as a primary class. The player will not be restricted to their chosen class however; a Knight could specialize in melee combat, or they could learn some Mage, Rogue, or Druid skills if they want to. Though, they will not be able to learn all the skills that a player who started in those classes can learn. The Developers have also stated some changes will be made to classes in future. Groves Groves are instanced areas accessible only by the owning player or clan. Owners can invite friends into their groves. Each player will be able to choose from a number of different styles of Groves, and will be able to modify the terrain, making mountains, valleys, lakes, etc. as they wish. Each player will be provided a basic Grove free of charge. Additions or amenities such as furniture to the Groves will likely cost credits. Clans Players will have the ability to both join and form clans, though creating them will cost 10 gold. Any player may create a clan if they wish, and there are NPC's for creating a clan in Camelot, Bremen, and Heartwood. Each clan gets its own chat channel, and ranks are available for the clan leader to decide on (Officer, Member, Initiate). Additionally, each clan will have its own Grove, though it is unclear if the Grove will be free, or if the new clan must pay for it. Clans can only be created by players, no preexisting clans will be established.

History The Church of the Holy Virgin in Babylon El-Darag was occupied from the 11th to the 15th centuries by several Coptic patriarchs, seven of whom were buried in the church. Pope Zacharias was one of them. Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria used to pray in the church before assuming papacy. According to tradition, the church was one of the resting places of the Holy Family during their sojourn in Egypt, as well as the location from which Peter sent his epistle (1 Peter 5:13). The relics of saints Demiana and Simon the Tanner are contained in the church as well. Architecture The ground plan of the church is typical of other Coptic churches: a narthex, a nave, a choir, northern and southern aisles and three sanctuaries. The northern sanctuary is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the southern sanctuary is used as a shrine. It contains several 19th century icons of the Holy Virgin and saints Demiana, Stephen, Barbara, Shenouda, Paul the Hermit, Anthony, and Peter and Paul.

Even though Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver pieces of eight (Spanish dollars and later Mexican dollars) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century. Britain adopted the gold standard in 1821 and an imperial order-in-council of 1838 resulted in Saint Lucia formally adopting the British sterling coinage in the year 1851. However, despite the circulation of British coins in St. Lucia, the silver pieces of eight continued to circulate alongside them and the private sector continued to use dollar accounts for reckoning. The international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in St. Lucia in 1882. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. From 1949, with the introduction of the British West Indies dollar, the currency of St. Lucia became officially tied up with that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. History From 1851, the British pound circulated on Saint Lucia, replacing the Saint Lucia livre. Sometime after 1882, private banknotes, denominated in dollars, began to be issued on the island. From 1920, some of these notes also bore the value in sterling, with 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. During this period, no subdivision of the dollar was issued and British coins continued to circulate. The government of Saint Lucia also issued paper money in 1920, denominated in sterling. In 1935, the British West Indies dollar was established, equal in value to the earlier Saint Lucia dollar and other similar issues elsewhere in the British West Indies. The last distinct issues of banknotes were made for Saint Lucia in 1940. Since 1965, the East Caribbean States dollar has circulated. Banknotes Three banks, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Colonial Bank and Barclays Bank, all issued 5 dollars notes. The Royal Bank of Canada issued notes in 1920, whilst the Colonial Bank issued notes until 1926 and Barclays Bank (which took over the Colonial Bank) issued notes between 1926 and 1940.

It went to Flanders in August and saw action in the Battle of Passchendaele, also known as the Third Battle of Ypres. It then returned to the southern part of the front and went into the St. Mihiel salient. The division returned to Flanders in November 1917 and saw action in the Allied tank attack in the Battle of Cambrai, as well as the subsequent German counterattack. In 1918, the division fought in the German Spring Offensive, seeing action in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). The 9th Bavarian Reserve Division's last major action was in the German attack in the Montdidier-Noyon sector in June 1918. The division was dissolved soon thereafter.

Early life Neville was the elder son of Richard Neville of Billingbear House in Berkshire and his wife Katherine Grey, the daughter of Ralph Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Werke. He was born in the parish of St Giles's-in-the- Fields, London, on 23 September 1681. His brother was Henry Neville, later Henry Grey. He was educated privately in 1691 and was admitted at Middle Temple in 1699. From 1699 to 1700, he travelled abroad in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France recording his observations in a diary and discussing theology in depth. When he returned he subscribed to the SPCK and the SPG, and for a while attended their meetings regularly. This enthusiasm earned him the nickname ‘Bishop Neville’. After a few years, he left the Established Church and joined Thomas Bradbury’s Independent congregation in Fetter Lane. He married Elizabeth Boteler, daughter of Sir John Boteler of Watton Woodhall, Hertfordshire on 14 February 1706. Political career Billingbear House, Berkshire, in 1669. Neville was elected Member of Parliament for Abingdon at the 1705 general election on 10 May. His Tory opponent, Sir Simon Harcourt, raised a petition against his return and was unsuccessful. At the 1708 general election, Neville was returned unopposed as MP for Wallingford, but was defeated in contests in 1710 and 1713. He was also defeated at Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1713. At the 1715 general election he was returned unopposed as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed with fellow dissenter John Barrington. He was appointed as one of the Commissioners for Stating the Debts due to the Army in 1715 and held the post until 1721. In 1717, he inherited Billingbear in the death of his father. He was returned for Berwick in a contest in the 1722 general election. In Parliament, Neville was a Whigs loyalist. He supported the Act for naturalising foreign Protestants in 1708, voted for the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, and generally acted with the Whigs. When the first split developed in the Whig party, he joined the Walpole faction, and voted with the majority which threw out the Peerage Bill of 1719. Neville's most prominent action as a member of the House of Commons was his defence in 1721 of James Craggs the elder and John Aislabie, former chancellor of the exchequer, who had been implicated in the affairs of the South Sea Company. Neville died on 24 November 1723. He had one daughter who died without issue.

Its capital is Jindřichův Hradec. To the east, about a fifth of the region, including the historical towns of Dačice and Slavonice, historically belongs to Moravia. As most of southern Bohemia, the district was ruled by the Vítkovci – descendants of Vítek z Prčice – from the turn of the 12th/13th century until the early modern era. One of the branches of Vítkovci – the Lords of Hradec (Páni z Hradce) – ruled over their large estates in the Bohemian-Moravian borderlands from the imposing residence in Jindřichův Hradec until their demise in 1598.

The oil level is a little low now to compensate for expansion when heating commences. The Thiele tube, named after the German chemist Johannes Thiele, is a laboratory glassware designed to contain and heat an oil bath. Such a setup is commonly used in the determination of the melting point of a substance. The apparatus itself resembles a glass test tube with an attached handle. Operation Oil is poured into the tube, and then the \\"handle\\" is heated, either by a small flame or some other heating element. The shape of the Thiele tube allows for formation of convection currents in the oil when it is heated. These currents maintain a fairly uniform temperature distribution throughout the oil in the tube. The side arm of the tube is designed to generate these convection currents and thus transfer the heat from the flame evenly and rapidly throughout the heating oil. The sample, packed in a capillary tube, is attached to the thermometer, and held by means of a rubber band or a small slice of rubber tubing. The Thiele tube is usually heated using a microburner with a small flame. Melting point determination A sample in a sealed capillary, attached to a thermometer with a rubber band, is immersed in the tube. Heating is commenced, and the temperature ranges at which the sample melts can then be observed. During heating, the point at which melting is observed and the temperature constant is the melting point of the sample. A more modern method uses dedicated equipment, known as a melting point apparatus. A slow heating rate at the melting point is needed in order to get an accurate measurement. Record the temperature on the thermometer when the sample starts to melt and record the temperature again when all of the sample has melted (this gives you the melting point range, which is what is usually quoted in chemical literature). Boiling point determination A sample in a fusion tube is attached to a thermometer with a rubber band, and immersed in the tube. A sealed capillary, open end pointing down, is placed in the fusion tube. The Thiele tube is heated; dissolved gases evolve from the sample first. Once the sample starts to boil, heating is stopped, and the temperature starts to fall. The temperature at which the liquid sample is sucked into the sealed capillary is the boiling point of the sample.

Born in Leeds, Porteous grew up near Manchester, but spent a lot of time in the Peak during holidays as a child, and later moved to live there, firstly to Combs, Derbyshire, near Chapel-en- le-Frith, and later to Darley Dale, near Matlock, where he lived until his death, aged 89. As a boy, Crichton Porteous had a great interest in reading and writing, and from the age of fourteen he kept a daily journal; these journals later proved a useful reference for his work. After working on farms he moved into newspapers, working his way up to become assistant editor of the Northern Daily Mail. As a freelance writer, his first book, Farmer's Creed, was published in 1938. This book recounted his memoirs about his time as a farm worker on Werneth Low. Today his work has been opened to a new audience through the show entitled In the Footsteps of Crichton Porteous, which toured widely in England, and particularly in the north-west.

Biography Lin Liguo (far right) with his father Lin Biao (second from right), mother Ye Qun (second from left) and sister Lin Liheng Lin was born on 1945. He graduated from the elite Beijing No. 4 High School and later entered the Faculty of Physics at Peking University. He later became member of the Chinese Communist Party. Following the start of Cultural Revolution, he dropped out of the university and joined the People's Liberation Army Air Force in 1967. Lin was promoted to the deputy director of the Office of the Air Force Command in 1969, by the commander of PLAAF Wu Faxian. This was an important position and all crucial documents must pass through the hands of Lin. According to Wu Faxian testimony in the 1980 trial: > \\"In fact, all the things the Air Force reported since July 6, 1970 were to > Liguo. After all the things we had to deal with, was to listen to his > orders.\\"Spence, J. D. (1999). The search for modern China. New York: Norton. > p.585. Mao Zedong's government claims, that in 1970, under his father Lin Biao's direction, Lin Liguo made a plan known as Project 571 to assassinate Mao Zedong in Shanghai, but Mao was alerted to it and left Shanghai one day ahead of schedule and changed return route back to Beijing. In February 1971, Lin Liguo took Yu Xinye, the deputy director of the Political Department of the PLAAF to Hangzhou; then he called another deputy director Zhou Yuchi from Beijing to Shanghai, and met them in Shanghai from March 20th to 24th. The Lin family, including Lin Biao, Ye Qun, and Lin Liguo, attempted to flee after the coup failed. On September 13, 1971, they fled in a PLAAF Hawker Siddeley Trident, from Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport. Party documents later released state: > \\"the plane was making for the Soviet Union but was inadequately fueled for > such a trip; it also had on board neither navigator nor radio operator. It > crashed in Mongolia on September 13, 1971, burning to death all on > board.\\"Spence, J. D. (1999). The search for modern China. New York: Norton. > p.585. However, according to the historian J. D. Spence, \\"this story is essentially beyond verification, since the photographs later released by the Chinese authorities are of dubious authenticity and details on Lin Biao’s exact plans and on the other plotters are blurred\\" The government narrative also does not sufficiently explain how and why Lin Biao's plane crashed. Skeptics have claimed that Lin's decision to flee to the Soviet Union was illogical, on the grounds that the United States or Taiwan would have been safer destinations. From November 1980 to January 1981, the trial of the members belonging to the counter-revolutionary group of Lin Biao and Gang of Four was held in Beijing. In particular, five high-ranking military personnel, including Wu Faxian, appeared before the court, where they testified that Lin Liguo was actively involved in Project 571. It is also still unclear whether Lin Biao himself planned a coup, or whether Lin Liguo and Ye Qun had such plans and did not inform Lin Biao about it. Trivia *Lin Liguo was not officially married. Zhang Ning, a singer and dancer of the Nanjing Military Region Music ensemble, became his fiancé. Following his death, Zhang was arrested and was sent to a re-education camp, where she spent four years. On 1975, she was released on the request of Premier Zhou Enlai and General Xu Shiyou. In 1989, she married a Chinese American businessman and moved to United States, where she gave birth to her son. * In 1960s, the albums of the British band Beatles were spreading among the children of high-ranking officials in Beijing. As a result, Lin Linguo became fond of Western rock music. With his suggestion, the songs of Beatles became popular within the PLAAF.

In his 2-year stint in Orlando, White compiled 17 sacks, including an AFL-record 15 in 2007. He was named the ADT Defensive Player of the Year in 2007. Second stint with Buccaneers After the Predators were eliminated from the 2007 playoffs, Head Coach Jay Gruden (the younger brother of Tampa Bay Buccaneers Head Coach Jon Gruden) recommended White to the Buccaneers head coach, who promptly invited him to training camp with the team. After making the cut at training camp, White was instantly thrust into the limelight on the Buccaneers defensive line. The release of veteran Pro Bowl end Simeon Rice shortly before the start of the pre-season, injuries to free agent acquisition Patrick Chukwurah and the fact that top five 2007 NFL Draft pick Gaines Adams was deemed not ready led to White seeing extended playing time on the field. In the game against the Atlanta Falcons in November 2007 White turned in a career performance. Starting opposite fellow rookie Adams, he sacked Falcons QB Byron Leftwich twice and forced two fumbles, one of which was returned for a touchdown by Ronde Barber. The Bucs won the game 31-7 to take a 2-game lead at the top of the NFC South.

After a 1968 album released under their former name, in 1969 Edwards Hand released an eponymous album produced by George Martin who, taking a break from working on The Beatles' White Album, described their music as \\"exceptional\\". The online CD vendors Freak Emporium (UK) and Forced Exposure (US) tentatively compare it to certain works by Kaleidoscope and Fairfield Parlour. A further album, Stranded, came in 1970. Also produced by Martin, for this they were backed by James Litherland on electric guitar, former Tornados drummer Clem Cattini and John Wetton – who was later to find fame with King Crimson and Asia – playing bass. Forced Exposure and Freak Emporium describe Stranded as... > ...a superb blend of styles that is very hard to categorise. Short West > Coast influenced rock tracks sit alongside all out progressive anglophile > pop symphonies that at times utilise the kind of 'everything including the > kitchen sink' tactics employed by Brian Wilson. Their final album, Rainshine, was again produced by Martin in 1971 but, rejected by the band's RCA Victor label. For this album, the line-up included the Americans Les Brown Jr. on drums and percussion and David Dowd on guitar, as well as Harry Reynolds on bass. In 1975 Edwards and Hand set to music the poems of a best selling 1973 children's picture book, illustrated by Alan Aldridge (famous for his work with the Beatles), called The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast which was loosely based on a poem called \\"Butterfly's Ball, and the Grasshopper's Feast\\" written in 1802 by William Roscoe. This album featured the voices of Dame Judi Dench and Sir Michael Hordern. It was originally released on the Argo label and has been re-released by wizardpresents.

He mostly sang roles from the Italian repertory, and, according to The New York Times, \\"was best known for his steady-toned, riveting portrayals of the major baritone roles of Giuseppe Verdi — among them Rigoletto, Simon Boccanegra, Amonasro in Aida, and Germont in La traviata\\". Life and career Ingvar Wixell was born in Luleå in 1931. After studies at the Stockholm Academy of Music, he made his debut in Gävle in 1952,Alain Pâris.

For the Royal Opera, London he sang Boccanegra in 1972. In America he appeared at Chicago Lyric Opera (Belcore, 1967) and the Metropolitan Opera (Rigoletto, 1973). He was engaged at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 1967 where he was a member for more than 30 years.Sørensen, Inger, 1993, Operalexikonet, p. 622. At Salzburg he sang a noted Pizarro at the Festival, where he appeared from 1966 to 1969, and at Bayreuth he sang the Herald in Lohengrin (1971). Among other roles, Wixell sang Figaro in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen, Amonasro in Verdi's Aida, Baron Scarpia in Puccini's Tosca, and the title roles in Verdi's Rigoletto, Simon Boccanegra, Mozart's Don Giovanni, Verdi's Falstaff and Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. Wixell performed all the songs in the competition to select Sweden's Eurovision Song Contest 1965 entry. The winning song was \\"Annorstädes Vals\\" (Elsewhere Waltz), which Wixell went on to perform at the international final in Naples. In a break from the then prevailing tradition, the song was sung in English (as \\"Absent Friend\\"). This led to the introduction from 1966 onwards of a rule stipulating that each country's entry must be sung in one of the languages of that country. Wixell ended his career in 2003 by singing the Music teacher in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos at Malmö Opera. Wixell died in Malmö on October 8, 2011,En stor operastjärna har slocknat, obituary in Dagens Nyheter October 10, 2011 aged 80.

With this song, Bennett had his all-time worst disagreement with Mitch Miller, Columbia's pop music executive at the time, who absolutely wanted Bennett to record a version of the song; similarly, Bennett \\"[absolutely wanted] not to go anywhere\\" near it. Bennett had no response to Miller's question, \\"Am I going to have you put out a bad record?\\" Having not entirely gotten over his fear of losing his contract with Columbia, Bennett subsequently sang a half-hearted version of the song (which was never recorded). After the performance, Miller got disgusted and told Bennett to \\"just give [him] one take all the way through and we can all go home.\\" Bennett thought \\"To hell with it\\", so he took off his jacket and tied it around his waist like a hula skirt, started to do a hula dance, and managed to survive the take. \\\\- Tony Bennett to YouTuber Michael McKenna.

One of Eddington's claims to fame is that the rescue team that set out to look for the ill-fated Burke and Wills party in the 19th century camped there overnight. While there were facilities including a brewery, cheese factory, butter factory, several hotels, race course and Churches during the second half of the 19th century, Eddington's population would be something less than 50 today (September 2007).

Biography  Kadish was born in London, England, of Russian Jewish descent. Her father was the artist Norman Maurice Kadish. She was educated at University College London, and St Antony's College, Oxford, where she received her doctorate in modern history. From 1986 to 1987 she was a Scheinbrun Visiting Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Her first book, based on her DPhil, Bolsheviks and British Jews was winner of a Choice Outstanding Academic Book award in 1993. From 1992 to 1993 she was Camperdown House Research Fellow at Royal Holloway College, University of London, during which time she researched and wrote A Good Jew and a Good Englishman, a centenary, but critical, history of the youth movement the Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade. Between 1994 and 1997 she returned to the Hebrew University where she worked at the Center for Jewish Art, helping to develop the Architecture Section of the Index of Jewish Art, whilst pursuing her interest in Anglo-Jewish Architecture and its preservation. In 1991, following a conference in London that she organised, Kadish founded the Working Party on Jewish Monuments in the UK & Ireland, a pressure group campaigning for the protection of historic synagogues, cemeteries and other sites of Jewish interest in the country. This was the precursor to Jewish Heritage UK, a preservation charity, that she founded and directed between 2004 and 2016. In 1997 she returned to Britain to embark on a national Survey of the Jewish Built Heritage in the UK and Ireland, a project made possible principally by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Her pioneering guidebook Jewish Heritage in England was first published by English Heritage in 2006 and a second edition, expanded, revised and updated, was published under the new title of Jewish Heritage in Britain and Ireland in 2015. A companion architectural guidebook Jewish Heritage in Gibraltar appeared in 2007.

The day commemorates Gibraltar's first sovereignty referendum of 1967, in which Gibraltarian voters were asked whether they wished to either pass under Spanish sovereignty, or remain under British sovereignty, with institutions of self-government.Ministry of Defence – Gibraltar soldiers celebrate their National Day in Iraq  History  In 1992, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar Joe Bossano, travelled to the United Nations to argue for the right to self-determination inspiring the formation of the Self Determination for Gibraltar Group (SDGG) which was at the time headed by Dennis Matthews, a one-time active member of the Integration with Britain Party (IWBP). In order to generate popular support for self-determination they held the first National Day at John Mackintosh Square (the Piazza) on 10 September 1992 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the day the 1967 sovereignty referendum was held on. Coincidentally, the 10 September was also the day the Gibraltar Legislative Council became representative and responsible for internal affairs in 1964. The first National Day was so successful that the avalanche of people that spontaneously turned up could not fit into John Mackintosh Square. The Government then took the responsibility of providing some help organising the event, since it fostered the right to self-determination that the Gibraltarians had been demanding at the United Nations since 1963. Therefore, the Government declared the 10 September a public holiday and gave the SDGG a grant for them to administer. In 1993 the venue was changed to the larger Grand Casemates Square, until it was again changed in 1998 to the even larger Naval Ground.  National identity  Gibraltarians dress in their national colours of red and white on National Day. The active opposition of the Spanish Government to self-determination combined with the negative posture of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, strengthened the resolution of the vast majority of the Gibraltarians to press ahead for their decolonisation by the year 2000 in accordance with the high principles of the Charter and the target date set by the United Nations to eradicate colonialism. Instead, the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, proposed joint sovereignty with Spain, which further intensified the sense of national identity reinforced by the National Day. The 10th National Day, held in 2001 included a speech by William Serfaty, the then leader of the SDGG, which stressed the themes of national identity, unity, resisting Spanish pressure and decolonisation.SDGG Speech 2001  Changes to format  Subsequent National Days have comparatively been quieter affairs with fewer invited guests and shorter political speeches. In 2007 the running of the political rally was taken over by the Government from the SDGG. In July 2008 the Government announced they would change the format of National Day to take effect the same year. The main change was their decision to no longer organise a political rally. The reason given was to emphasise civic celebration of Gibraltar rather than political revindication. Other changes included relocating the main event to the smaller John Mackintosh Square from Grand Casemates Square, appointing the Mayor of Gibraltar to conduct the main event rather than any political leader, the presentation of the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour and the reading of the Gibraltar National Day Declaration.Government of Gibraltar Press Release – Format changes to National Day  Observances  symbolic release of 30,000 red and white balloons from Grand Casemates Square on National Day 2013 The official Gibraltar National Day events begin with a children’s fancy dress competition held at the lobby of the Parliament building in Main Street followed by a street party at John Mackintosh Square where food and drink stalls are set up providing Gibraltarian food such as calentita. Later a selected school choir sings songs with a Gibraltar theme, namely Llévame Donde Nací and Virgencita de Europa. This is followed by the main event, the Mayor's recitation of the names of the recipients of the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour and the reading of the Gibraltar National Day Declaration from atop the City Hall's balcony. This was previously followed by the traditional release from atop the Parliament building of 30,000 red and white balloons, representing Gibraltar's population, which had featured on this day since 1992. The balloon release tradition has been ended this year due to the threat that it poses to wildlife, marine wildlife in particular. In the meantime, the school choir leads the general public in the singing of the Gibraltar Anthem.Government of Gibraltar – Gibraltar National Day events 2009 A funday for children featuring bouncy castles and fairground rides is then held at Grand Casemates Square. There is live music is played all afternoon at Governor’s Parade (the Piazzella) and the Rock on the Rock Club, all free of charge, as opposed to the Gibraltar Music Festival a paid event leading up to national day. Since 2007, there has been a verbena for the older members of the community. The day culminates with a half-hour-long synchronised fireworks display released from the Detached Mole in the Gibraltar Harbour at night followed by a rock concert.  Political rally  Chief Minister Fabian Picardo delivering his speech during the 2013 National Day political rally In 2008, the Government announced that it would change the format of Gibraltar National Day celebrations with effect from this year. This followed the new Constitution in which Britain recognised Gibraltar's right to self-determination. The changes to the format were intended to emphasise Gibraltar's civic celebration rather than political revindication. There would be a gathering of the community at John Mackintosh Square for a collective celebratory event. The SDGG returned from its state of inactivity and organised a political rally at Grand Casemates Square featuring the leader of the SDGG, and those of the Opposition political parties: Gibraltar Liberal Party and the Progressive Democratic Party. The event was scheduled to last a maximum of 30–45 minutes, allowing those participating to attend the main event of civic functions held at John Mackintosh Square. Speeches were short (around 5 minutes) kept to the leader of the SDGG and those of the other three parties. The event was well attended and seen as a success. The GSD Government did not send a representative as they considered the main rally held at John Mackintosh Square to be the only official one.Government of Gibraltar Press Release – Government does not support the National Day political rally  Gibraltar Medallion of Honour  In July 2008, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Peter Caruana announced that the Government would establish a civic award scheme, to be known as the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour, which would be awarded by Parliament.Gibraltar Medallion of Honour The award is formally presented annually by the Mayor of Gibraltar prior to the release of the balloons on Gibraltar National Day.Gibraltar Chronicle – 'We Are Gibraltar'  2009 recipients  The 2009 recipients of the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour were: * Jose Netto – for services to trade unionism and workers; * Adolfo Canepa – for public services and services to politics; * Joseph Gaggero – for services to aviation, shipping, business and commerce; * Maurice Xiberras – for public services and services to politics.  Declaration  Since 2008, a Gibraltar National Day declaration is read by the Mayor of Gibraltar at a civic rally held at outside the City Hall. It was first read out publicly by Mayor Solomon Levy.Gibraltar National Day Declaration  References  Category:Annual events in Gibraltar Gibraltar Category:September observances Category:Gibraltarian society ","title":"Gibraltar National Day"},{"id":"13066626","text":"Bobby Davidson (1969) Robert Holley \\"Bobby\\" Davidson (19 July 1928 – 23 December 1993) was a Scottish football referee who also operated for FIFA.

Campus Development Siberian Federal University appears to have a special place in the development programmes of Krasnoyarsk agglomeration. Its intellectual center must have an appropriate infrastructure, so the construction of a university campus has been initially planned. The university campus will occupy an area of 650 hectares, with 22 new building projects in its territory. Campus will include academic buildings, a library with storages for 3 million volumes, a sports complex of international level, a congress hall with auditoriums for conferences and exhibitions, several sports centers, student dormitories and accommodation for teachers, hotels for visiting professors, cinema complex, and stores. With the active financial support of regional authorities two academic university buildings have been completed. The Institute of Space and Information Technology, the Institute for the Humanities, the Institute of Philology and Language Communication and the Institute of Urban Construction, Management and Regional Economics are located in these buildings. The building of modern digital library and university administration has been put into service. In August 2009, a new dormitory for 700 students with a modern layout has been brought into operation. By the decision of the student union committee the freshmen became the first tenants of the dormitory. The documentation for the construction of several dormitories and new academic buildings has been already prepared on the federal authorities instructions. The university campus is becoming really attractive to young people and city residents. An essential part of the campus will be a technopark that will combine research capacities of the university and institutes of the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, SibFU staff and resources of the largest high- tech corporations. Development of International Collaboration In Siberian Federal University much attention is devoted to development of international collaboration and integration into international research and educational space. The International Department has been established to collect and spread information about various scholarship programs and grants such as: The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX), the American Councils for International Education (ACTR), Fulbright and others. For the present moment the university has close contacts with institutes and universities in countries such as: Great Britain, Germany, Spain, France, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Italy, Japan, the United States, the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Turkey, Singapore, Mongolia and the Republic of Korea. Special attention is paid to the development of relationships with the CIS and SCO countries.

Because identifying the characters by name would spoil the plot of the play for audience members, printed programs normally identify the four characters as Woman, Man, Girl, and Young Man, which are also the names used for them in the script. Plot A middle-aged Irish couple, John and Maureen Mackey, bring a young couple, Susan and Larry, to the suburban Boston home where the Mackeys are caretakers. Susan and Larry have recently begun to date, and the Mackeys approached them at a restaurant due to Susan's resemblance to a dead woman, Veronica. The Mackeys explain that Veronica's elderly, senile sister, Cissie, is now their charge, and Susan agrees to dress up as Veronica in an effort to bring Cissie a sense of closure. The year is 1973, but Cissie believes it to be 1935. Larry and the Mackeys leave Susan alone in Veronica's preserved bedroom to change into a period outfit. The older couple return with completely different appearances and personalities; they appear about twenty years younger and now have Boston accents. They treat the young woman as if she were Veronica, and they represent themselves as her parents, Lloyd and Nedra. They accuse her of having murdered Cissie after Cissie discovered (and threatened to reveal) Veronica's incestuous relationship with their younger brother, Conrad. They also maintain that it is 1935. When the young woman stands by her identity as Susan from 1973, Lloyd and Nedra regard her as insane and call for the family physician, Dr. Simpson. When he arrives, the young woman recognises him as Larry. The young woman is ultimately broken; she acknowledges that she is Veronica and she confesses to Veronica's misdeeds. Nedra then leads the others in murdering her. It is revealed that the older man and woman are in fact Veronica and Conrad, while the younger man is their son, \\"Boy.\\" This is not the first time the three have carried out such a murder, nor will it be the last; Boy brings Veronica and Conrad young women who resemble Veronica, so that Veronica can experience murdering herself as a catharsis. They give the bodies to Boy, a necrophiliac, to do with as he wishes. Veronica is left alone in her room. Productions In the original Broadway production in 1973, Eileen Heckart played the Woman, Arthur Kennedy played the Man, Regina Baff played the Girl, and Kipp Osborne played the Young Man.

A center fielder, Judnich played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for seven seasons with the St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians, and Pittsburgh Pirates. In 790 career games, Judnich recorded a batting average of .281 and accumulated 90 home runs and 420 runs batted in (RBI). Born in San Francisco, California, Judnich began his career with the New York Yankees, spending five seasons in the organization. The St. Louis Browns acquired him in 1940 and he was plugged into the starting lineup. He was the starting center fielder for three seasons. After the 1942 season, he joined the United States Air Force to serve in World War II. When he returned to baseball in 1946, he was no longer an everyday player, and in 1947 the Browns turned him into a first baseman. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians in 1948, where he served as a utility player and was a member of the 1948 World Series champions. He was sent to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1949, then spent the next six seasons in the Pacific Coast League before retiring from the game in 1955. Early life and career Born and raised in San Francisco, California, Judnich grew up wanting to be a baseball player, playing semi-pro baseball on a team sponsored by the Mission Reds. He graduated from Mission High School in 1935, and signed with the New York Yankees organization by Yankees scout Joe Devine after participating in a baseball training camp in Oakland, which included future MLB players Tiny Bonham and Len Gabrielson. Judnich spent the 1935 season with the Class C Akron Yankees, where he had a .274 batting average in 109 games. The following year, he played for the Class B Norfolk Tars, and hit .303 with 24 home runs in 143 games. In 1937, he was again promoted to the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), where he hit .316 with 14 triples in 175 games. Judnich spent 1938 with the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, and hit .273 in 150 games. Judnich played for the Newark Bears of the International League in 1939, and had a .284 batting average. Before the 1940 season began, Judnich was sold to the St. Louis Browns after not being offered a major league contract; as the Yankees had Joe DiMaggio as an everyday center fielder, Judnich was considered expendable. St. Louis Browns and military service Judnich entered the major leagues in 1940 with the Browns, and after impressing the Browns in spring training, made his major league debut on April 16. By the halfway point of the season, he was being touted as a future star by manager Fred Haney thanks to his ability to hit home runs as well as his hitting in the clutch. In his rookie season with the Browns, Judnich had 24 home runs, 89 RBIs, 7 triples, and 97 runs scored, all of which would end up being career highs. He also had a .303 batting average in 137 games, which included a batting average of .360 after the All-Star Game, and finished 18th in Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting with six votes. In 1941, Judnich started off the season in a slump, and partway through the season he had a batting average under .200. He remained in the starting lineup for the Browns and rebounded by the end of the season, finishing with a .284 batting average, 14 homers, 40 doubles, and 83 RBIs in a career-high 146 games. Judnich remained as the starting center fielder for 1942. His performance for the season included hitting two home runs and five RBIs in a 9–0 win against the New York Yankees on September 10. For the season, he hit 17 home runs, seventh in the American League, with 82 RBIs and a .313 average, a career-high. He was one of only seven players in the American League to reach the .300 mark in the season, and was the only Browns player to do so. Judnich also finished 16th in MVP voting with 14 votes. In March 1943, Judnich was called to serve in the military for World War II. He was married in June 1941, but passed on deferment to enlist. He served in the United States Air Force and was stationed at McClellan Field, where he was certified as a marksman and promoted to corporal in October. He also took part in an Army-Navy baseball game and a benefit game against players from the Pacific Coast League, which raised $25,000 () for the servicemen. The following year, he was transferred alongside Joe DiMaggio to Hickam Field in Hawaii, and also played for the Seventh Air Force baseball team. In one exhibition game, Judnich hit five consecutive home runs and 12 RBIs in a 30–2 victory for his team. He spent 1945 stationed at Camp Beale in California before being discharged on November 30. Judnich returned to the starting lineup for the 1946 St. Louis Browns season, but he did not have the same power as he did before military service. In July, manager Luke Sewell benched Judnich for Al Zarilla for a few games in an attempt to reverse Judnich's struggles. He finished the season with a .262 batting average, 15 home runs and 72 RBIs in 132 games, but did perform better in night games, where he had a .309 batting average. In 1947, new Browns manager Muddy Ruel converted Judnich's position to first baseman in an attempt to get Paul Lehner, the team's other center fielder, in the lineup every day. Judnich played nearly every day as well, despite disliking playing first base and preferring to play in the outfield, only missing a few games to return home to witness the birth of his son. He finished the season with a .258 batting average, 18 home runs, and 64 RBIs in 144 appearances. Later life and career On November 20, 1947, the Browns traded Judnich and Bob Muncrief to the Cleveland Indians for $25,000, Joe Frazier, Dick Kokos, and Bryan Stephens. Originally projected to be the starting center fielder, the acquisition of Thurman Tucker later that offseason led to Judnich becoming a utility player. He split time between center field, right field, and first base, backing up Tucker, Allie Clark, and Eddie Robinson, respectively, depending on the pitching matchup on a given day. In 79 games, Judnich hit .257 with two home runs and 29 RBIs. In the 1948 World Series, he hit .077 (1-for-13) with a run and one RBI in four games. On February 9, 1949, the Pittsburgh Pirates purchased Judnich's contract from the Indians to give them extra depth at first base, and he started the season on the major league roster as a result. He only played in ten games for the Pirates, hitting .229, and in May his contract was sold to the San Francisco Seals of the PCL, ending his major league career. Judnich spent the rest of 1949 with the Seals, and had a .269 batting average and 18 home runs in 116 games. In 1950, he joined the Seattle Rainiers. In 166 games, Judnich had a .285 batting average with 19 home runs and 84 RBIs. Judnich got off to a hot start for Seattle in 1951, and after the first two months of the season he had a .381 batting average, which led the Pacific Coast League. In 147 games, Judnich had a .329 batting average with 21 home runs and 102 RBIs, en route to Seattle winning the Pacific Coast League championship. While a member of the Rainiers, he spent the winter playing for the Leones de Ponce in Puerto Rico. Judnich returned to the Rainiers in 1952, finishing the season with a .287 batting average, 15 home runs, and 105 RBIs in 177 games, and he followed that up in 1953 with a .298 average, 16 home runs, and 101 RBIs in 147 games. After the 1953 season, the Portland Beavers purchased Judnich's contract from Seattle, as Seattle was looking to keep their team young and replace the 37-year old. In 156 games for Portland, he hit .272 with 18 home runs and 81 RBIs. Judnich began the following season with Portland, and played in 25 games before his contract was sold to the San Francisco Seals, where he had a .282 average in 112 games. After the season, the Seals sent Judnich to the Louisville Colonels, but Judnich did not want to leave the west coast, and refused the move, retiring from baseball as a result. After retiring from professional baseball, Judnich moved to Glendale, California, where he lived with his wife and three children. He led a relatively quiet life; when asked of hobbies or interests, he stated during his career, \\"our fans here aren't interested in those things.\\" He died at the age of 55, and was interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale.

The building has 65 classrooms, but as the student body has outgrown it, expansion is required. 42 trailers are located in front of the building, pending a planned expansion of the school, set to be completed in time for the 2021 school year. The Grayson Technical Education School extends past the main high school building and has a greenhouse and Black Box theater among many other facilities. Most recently, the Grayson Technical Education School partnered with Gwinnett Technical College to build a veterinary surgical suite. The school’s current demographics for the 2019-2020 school year goes as follows: 52% African-American, 22% White, 15% Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 4% Mixed Race or Other.

They played a decidedly technical style of thrash originally evoking bands like Testament, though they would later move on to playing in their own unique, more progressive thrash style. After dissolving in 1995, they reformed in 2005 and released their fourth studio album The Prophecy in late 2009. They broke up once again in 2012, but announced yet another reunion in September 2019. Biography Early career (1985–1988) Defiance was formed in 1985 by guitarist Brad Bowers, drummer Matt Vander Ende, and bassist Mike Kaufmann. Doug Harrington joined later but left the band not long after due to conflicts with Bowers, and was replaced by Jim Adams. Eventually the band ousted Bowers and replaced him with Harrington. In 1987 the band recruited a vocalist in Mitch Mayes. Now with a stable and complete lineup, Defiance began playing shows in the Bay Area. With the local thrash scene gaining momentum, the band attained local notoriety. Their first demo was released in 1987. Shortly afterwards Mayes left the band and was replaced by Ken Elkington. With Elkington the band issued their Hypothermia demo in 1988. This demo caught the attention of the independent metal label Roadracer Records, who signed the band that year. At Roadracer's insistence, the band traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to record their debut album with Annihilator guitarist Jeff Waters. Product of Society and Void Terra Firma (1989–1990) The band's debut, Product of Society was released in 1989. The band was very much unsatisfied with Waters' production job, as he told the band to turn down the volume pots on their guitars, resulting in a very thin riff sound, and the members also claim Waters was acting unprofessionally during the recording. Nonetheless the album managed to attract attention in the thrash community despite the frequent label as a Testament knock-off. After playing a few dates in the Bay Area, Elkington was fired due to lack of commitment and former Laughing Dead vocalist Steev Esquivel was added to the group and finished the band's tours for the album. With Esquivel on board, Defiance released their second album, Void Terra Firma in 1990. Produced by John Cuniberti (best known for producing Joe Satriani's Surfing With the Alien), the production was slightly better but still a bit sketchy. The band's overall sound became a little more progressive but stuck to the Bay Area thrash ideals, though many compared Esquivel's singing style to Chuck Billy of Testament. This was the band's biggest commercial success, featuring a metal hit in its cover of Iron Maiden's \\"Killers\\". The band toured with Vio-lence in support of the album that year. Beyond Recognition (1991–1992) The band went into the studio with Rob Beaton to record their third album in 1991, but problems arose when Steev Esquivel's drug addictions became over the top and he left the group. He was briefly replaced by former Militia vocalist Matt Ulrickson, but the band was dissatisfied with the results and fired him. The now cleaner Esquivel returned to the band, but this led to the delay of the recording of the album. Defiance's third release Beyond Recognition was finally released in 1992. Straying away from the band's original thrash trappings, the band explores extremely technical songs with odd time signatures and off the wall song structures, even experimenting with jazz fusion elements, but while remaining true to the thrash metal formula. This coupled with the much improved production made for it to be considered Defiance's best work by many fans. It was by far the band's most critically acclaimed album, but due to a lack of support from Roadracer and a shifting musical atmosphere, it suffered in sales especially in America (though sales in Europe and Japan were still substantial). The personal management for the artist, Defiance, during the period including the albums, Void Terra Firma and Beyond Recognition, was Greg Burnham of FTC Entertainment Group. [Source: Beyond Recognition album cover] Around this time Roadracer began to apparently treat the band poorly. The band was denied a tour of Europe with Sepultura, where the band still had a substantial audience. Jim Adams and Matt Vander Ende left the band after the album's tentative single, \\"Inside Looking Out\\" (featuring guest vocals from David White of Heathen), was denied single or video release. They were replaced by Brian Wenzel and Mike Bennet respectively. Matt Vander Ende briefly joined Laaz Rocket, and later in 2004 he moved to New York City to become the drummer for the Broadway show Wicked. Jim Adams returned to the band shortly after he left and Mike Bennet was replaced by Tyson Leeper. The band did a short American tour, with Leeper leaving and being replaced by Paul Palmer in the process. Rotating members, breakup and aftermath (1993–2004) In 1993 Steev Esquivel left the band and was replaced by vocalist Dave White. In late 1993 with Dave and Paul in the lineup, Defiance wrote and recorded new material including \\"Safe\\" (Kaufmann, Harrington, White), \\"Don't Play God\\" (Harrington, Palmer, White) \\"Wasting Creation\\" (Harrington, White, Adams, Palmer), songs which were recorded and mastered with this lineup in 1994 by producer/engineer Rob Beaton (\\"Beyond Recognition\\" album). Several supporting performances ensued including a co- headline appearance at a large festival in Santa Barbara (Spring 1994). Although he played drums through the show, Palmer experienced a serious ankle injury when approaching the stage immediately prior. Due to surgery he was incapacitated for several months thereafter, ultimately retiring the drummer from the band. Around 1995, Defiance dissolved. White, Harrington, Adams, and Kaufmann and new drummer then created the groove metal band Inner Threshold, which later evolved into Under. Meanwhile, Steev Esquivel achieved considerable success in the late 1990s with the groove metal group Skinlab, who released three albums before splitting up in 2003, although they have reunited occasionally since 2007. Reunion and second breakup (2005–2012) In 2005 after over a decade since their disbandment, Defiance reunited with Esquivel, Harrington, Adams, and Kaufmann along with new drummer James Raymond. This incarnation of the band began working on new material, now signed to Metal Mind Productions. Metal Mind reissued the first three of the band's LPs via the Insomnia box set in 2006. James Raymond departed the band and was replaced by former Vio-lence drummer Mark Hernandez. In November 2006 tragedy struck Defiance when guitarist Doug Harrington died of cancer, which he had been battling secretly for years. However, the band continued working on the new release in his honor and the new album features guitar work recorded by Harrington just days before his passing. It is said to be true to the band's thrash roots, but with progressive touches similar to their third offering Beyond Recognition. A new song titled \\"The Voice\\" was posted on the band's Myspace page. The lineup was Esquivel on vocals, Adams on guitar, Kaufmann on bass, and Hernandez on drums. In late 2008, Defiance announced on its Myspace page and website that it had signed with Candlelight Records to release its new album. As of mid-2009, the recording of the album (titled The Prophecy) was completed and given a release date of October 19, 2009. Following the release, Esquivel once again quit the band, claiming he only intended to record some material with Defiance because that was what Doug Harrington had wanted him to do before he died. The band now has a new singer Keven Albert and a new guitarist Shawn Bozarth. After trying out different drummers for the new line up, Defiance recruited Burton Ortega ex-member of KAOS to support the new album The Prophecy.  Second reunion (2019–present)  On September 26, 2019, Defiance announced on their Facebook page that they were going to reunite for an appearance in April 2020 at the Blades of Steel Metal festival in Milwaukee. To coincide with the reunion, Vic Records will release a two-disc compilation, Checkmate: The Demo Collection, November 27, 2020; it contains Defiance's demos between 1986 and 1994 in their entirety. The band also has a new album in the works.

Plot introduction Archie Goodwin is part of a house party at Lily Rowan's vacation home in Montana when a murder brings Nero Wolfe from New York to take a hand. Uniquely for a Nero Wolfe novel, it takes place entirely away from the brownstone on West 35th Street. (Some Buried Caesar came close, but returned to the brownstone for a brief coda; Too Many Cooks similarly came very close, but includes a brief description of the departure from the brownstone, including the good-byes from Fritz, Saul and Theodore.)  Plot Summary  While on vacation at Lily Rowan's Montana beef ranch, Archie Goodwin becomes involved in a murder investigation. Harvey Greve, the ranch manager, has been accused of the murder of Philip Brodell, a wealthy \\"dude\\" on vacation at a neighbouring ranch. The previous year, Brodell had seduced and impregnated Greve's daughter, and Greve had swore revenge; however both Archie and Lily are skeptical of his guilt. Brodell was shot twice, once in the back, by an inexpert marksman; as well as Greve being an excellent shot, Archie is convinced that he is too honorable to shoot an unarmed opponent in the back. However, the local sheriff, Morley Haight, has only lazily investigated the murder before settling on Greve's guilt in large part due to a bitter grudge between the two. Archie himself suspects the Sheriff's son Gilbert, who had been wooing Greve's daughter and had himself threatened to murder Brodell, but as an outsider himself Archie is having difficulty in persuading the distrustful, hostile locals to open up to him. Despite the difficulties, Archie's honor will not allow him to abandon Greve to his plight, and he writes to Nero Wolfe informing him that he will be taking an extended leave while he tries to clear Greve's name. Irritated at the interruptions to his routine that this causes, Wolfe uses a high-ranking contact in the Montana state government to research the case before taking the almost unprecedented step of leaving his home and travelling to Montana to consult with Archie in person. Convinced by Archie's argument, Wolfe decides to solve the case to enable Archie and himself to return to New York. He stays at Lily's ranch along Archie and her other guests; Diana Kadany, an actress friend of Lily's, and Wade Worthy, an author writing a biography of Lily's father. Wolfe contacts the local county attorney, Thomas Jessup, and convinces him to appoint himself and Archie as public investigators. Jessup, a rival to Sheriff Haight and himself skeptical of the investigation, agrees to do so, and having official status means that the locals are no longer able to ignore or dismiss their investigation. They subsequently learn that Gilbert Haight has a strong alibi proving he was unable to have committed the murder, but that there were numerous points of friction and tension between Brodell and the fellow guests and employees at the ranch he was staying at that a competent investigation should have uncovered. In particular, Wolfe and Archie agree that one cowhand, Sam Peacock, knows more than he is letting on about the crime. They attempt to meet and interview him at a local dance but are stymied by Sheriff Haight, resentful at Wolfe's undermining of his authority. When leaving the dance, however, Wolfe and Archie discover Peacock's dead body hidden in their car. Haight takes the opportunity to arrest Archie and Wolfe, but with Jessup's intervention Wolfe is placed in house arrest. While Archie is imprisoned, Wolfe orders Saul Panzer to travel to St. Louis, Brodell's home town, to investigate any possible connections between Brodell and the other out-of-towners in the area. When Archie is released, Wolfe reveals to his fellow guests that he has learned from Saul Panzer that a photo of one of the out-of-towners was recognised as Carl Yaeger, a man suspected of strangling a young woman but who fled before he could be apprehended. He then suggests to Lily and Diana that they spend the afternoon fishing, implicitly identifying Wade Worthy as Yaeger; Brodell had recognised Worthy as Yaeger and Worthy/Yaeger had murdered him to keep his secret, but was forced to also murder Peacock when learning that Brodell had passed this information on to him. When Wolfe reveals that a St. Louis detective is arriving in town to arrest him, Worthy/Yaeger flees -- just as Wolfe planned. When Sheriff Haight and the St. Louis detective arrive at Lily's ranch to arrest Worthy/Yaeger, Wolfe reveals that he has previously arranged with Jessup and the state police to have him apprehended away from Lily's ranch in order to spare his host the embarrassment and ignominy of having a murderer taken into custody from her home, to thank Jessup for his help and to humiliate Haight in retribution for his inept investigation and spiteful treatment of himself and Archie. Worthy/Yaeger is apprehended and Harvey Greve is released from custody, allowing Wolfe and Archie to return to New York.

Wolfe, outraged at the thought of such a violent act taking place in his own house, resolves to find the murderer without sharing any information with Inspector Cramer. Soon Wolfe and Archie find themselves investigating two additional murders: the earlier killing of a customer at Rusterman's, and the subsequent death of the waiter's daughter. For much of the story, Stout leads the reader to believe that the central murder mystery is related to the Watergate scandal. Ultimately, Wolfe discovers that the killer is one of his closest associates, a character who had been appearing in Nero Wolfe mysteries for over forty years. A Family Affair is an unusual Nero Wolfe mystery in that Archie reveals his (correct) opinion of the killer's identity well before Wolfe does so in the closing chapters.

Formation and charter Railroads were begun in Texas in the 1850s with railheads on the Gulf Coast running inland. As the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railroad completed its track-laying near Columbus, Texas, investors formed a company to extend tracks into the interior of Texas. William Harbert, Andrew M. Campbell, George W. Smith Stein, Bill. Consider the Lily: The Ungilded History of Colorado County, Texas. Nesbitt Memorial Library, Columbus, Texas. and Gustav SchleicherHandbook of Texas Online. Texas State Historical Association intended to extend the railroad from the Colorado River to San Antonio and beyond. The Columbus, San Antonio and Rio Grande Railroad was chartered by the Texas legislature on February 16, 1858. The charter granted the company the right to build track from Columbus through Gonzales and San Antonio to the Rio Grande. The legislature, in the charter, imposed strict deadlines on the company: two years to begin building track and four years to finish 25 miles. The railroad was unable to meet the standards and the legislature subsequently extended the deadlines on February 8, 1860, granting an additional year to begin building. Civil War and disruption According to R. A. Thompson, Engineer of the Texas Railroad Commission, \\"The blighting effects of the Civil War were felt by the railroads perhaps more than by any other kind of enterprise, and during the financial depression extending particularly from 1862 to 1869, building practically ceased.\\" In fact, the CSA&RG; did not lay any tracks before or during the war. On August 28, 1868, the legislature amended the charter of the Columbus, San Antonio and Rio Grande Railroad to allow it to commence its rail line at Gonzales, or some other point on the as yet unbuilt rail line of the Indianola and Austin Railroad, rather than at Columbus.Gammel, (compiler) The Laws of Texas 1822-1897, vol. 6, p. 56.

Shneidman (May 13, 1918 – May 15, 2009) was an American clinical psychologist, suicidologist and thanatologist. Together with Norman Farberow and Robert Litman, in 1958, he founded the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center, where the men were instrumental in researching suicide and developing a crisis center and treatments to prevent deaths. In 1968, Shneidman founded the American Association of Suicidology and the principal United States journal for suicide studies, Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior. In 1970, he became Professor of Thanatology at the University of California, where he taught for decades. He published 20 books on suicide and its prevention. Early life and education Shneidman was born in York, Pennsylvania in 1918 to Russian Jewish immigrants. His father was a merchant with a department store. As a child, Shneidman attended local public schools. He went to the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) for undergraduate and graduate work, earning a master's degree in psychology in 1940. His education was interrupted by World War II, and he served in the Army. Afterward, Shneidman returned to graduate school, earning a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of Southern California (USC). As an intern, he studied schizophrenia, then thought to be environmentally caused, at the Veterans Administration hospital in Brentwood|. He was an atheist.\\"The other day Vernette said he [Shneidman] was blessed. True enough, he thought, but not quite right, not blessed. On a napkin on the TV tray he scribbled down the Greek prefix, eu, for good, and then through association and sound, fell upon doria... this would be the word for his good fortune. Eudoria... gratitude without an object, no one to credit, no one to thank. No Jesus, no Yahweh, Muhammad, Vishnu or Buddha. Because he believes life isn't contingent upon god or upon prayers. There is no heaven, no hell. Happiness lies in te here and now and the satisfaction of living a good life without religion or myth to guide you.\\" Waiting for death, alone and unafraid, Thomas Curwen, Los Angeles Times, 28 February 2009 (Accessed 18 May 2009) Career In the late 1940s, Shneidman became interested in the problem and mystery of suicide while working at the Veterans Hospital in Brentwood. Becoming involved in trying to understand one case, he conducted much research into suicide notes and motivations. He formulated many terms to use in such study: as his researcher colleague Norman Farberow wrote of him: \\"He is one of the brightest, sharpest, most intellectually gifted persons I have ever known,\\" and later spoke of Shneidman's ability to coin new terms, such as suicidology,Farberow, N. L. (1993). \\"Bereavement after suicide\\", in A. A. Leenaars (Ed.), Suicidology: Essays in Honor of Edwin S. Shneidman. Northvale, NJ, Jason Aronson, Inc. psychological autopsy,Litman, R.

Journal of General Psychology, 56, 251-256. (notes collected from non-suicidal subjects and compared with writings in a 1957 study). In 1958 with Norman Farberow and Robert Litman, he founded the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center. The psychoanalyst Litman acted as executive director. At a time when suicide was little studied and discussion of it was avoided, they were pioneers. Shneidman helped them get funding for the project from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In 1966 Shneidman began working as chief of a national project at the NIH to establish suicide prevention centers, and increased their number from a few to 100 in 40 states in three years. In 1968 Shneidman founded the American Association of Suicidology and its bi-monthly journal, Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior. (Its current president in 2020 is Jonathan Singer and its Chief Executive Officer is Colleen Creighton.) Changes in ideas of medical care led to the end of the national project and decreases in funds for suicide prevention centers. The Los Angeles Center was combined with programs of the Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center. More recently, treatment of people suffering depression and bipolar disorder, often associated with suicide, has depended chiefly on the biological model and psychiatric drugs. In 1970 he became the first professor of thanatology at UCLA, where he taught until 1988. He continued to write and to mentor other psychologists throughout his life. Marriage and family Shneidman married Jeanne, and they had four sons: David William, Jonathan Aaron, Paul Samuel, Robert JamesWILLIAM DICKE, \\"Edwin Shneidman, Authority on Suicide, Dies at 91\\", New York Times, May 21, 2009 He died at the age of 91 on May 15, 2009 in Los Angeles, California.

Farrar, Straus and Cudahy) The Flower Drum Song is a novel by Chinese- American author C. Y. Lee, first published in 1957. The novel tells the story of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco, and was a bestseller in its time. It is the basis of 1958 musical Flower Drum Song, and later a movie of the same title, released in 1961, starring Nancy Kwan and James Shigeta. Background Author C. Y. Lee fled war-torn China in the 1940s and came to the United States, where he attended Yale University's playwriting program, graduating in 1947 with a Master of Fine Arts degree. By the 1950s, he was barely making a living writing short stories and working as a Chinese teacher, translator and journalist for San Francisco Chinatown newspapers.Shin, Andrew. \\"'Forty Percent Is Luck': An Interview with C.

Retrieved December 3, 2010 He had hoped to break into playwriting, but instead wrote a novel about Chinatown, The Flower Drum Song (originally titled Grant Avenue). Lee initially had no success selling his novel, but his agent submitted it to the publishing house of Farrar, Straus and Cudahy. The firm sent the manuscript to an elderly reader for evaluation, and the reader was subsequently found dead in bed, the manuscript beside him with the words \\"Read this\\" scrawled on it. The publishing house did so, and bought Lee's novel, which became a bestseller in 1957.Lewis, p. 28 Synopsis Lee's novel centers on Wang Chi-yang, a 63-year-old man who fled China to avoid the communists. The wealthy refugee lives in a house in the Chinatown district of San Francisco with his two sons. A regular visitor to the household is his sister-in-law Madam Tang, who is taking citizenship classes and urges Wang to adopt Western ways. While his sons and sister-in-law are integrating into American culture, Wang stubbornly resists assimilation and speaks only two words of English, \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\". Wang also has a severe cough, which he does not wish to have cured, feeling that it gives him authority in his household. Wang's elder son, Wang Ta, woos Linda Tung, but on learning that she has many men in her life, drops her; he later learns she is a nightclub dancer. Linda's friend, seamstress Helen Chao, who has been unable to find a man despite the shortage of eligible women in Chinatown, gets Ta drunk and seduces him. On awakening in her bed, he agrees to an affair, but eventually abandons her, and she commits suicide. Impatient at Ta's inability to find a wife, Wang arranges for a picture bride for his son. However, before the new bride arrives, Ta meets a young woman, May Li, who with her father has recently come to San Francisco. The two support themselves by singing depressing songs on the street. With his father's approval, Ta invites the two into the Wang household, and he and May Li fall in love. He vows to marry her after she is falsely accused by the household servants of stealing a clock, though his father stands in opposition. Wang struggles to understand the conflicts that have torn his household apart; his hostility toward assimilation is isolating him from his family. In the end, taking his son's advice, Wang decides not to go to the herbalist to seek a remedy for his cough, but instead enters a Chinese-run Western clinic, symbolizing the beginning of his acceptance of American culture.Lewis, pp. 25–33 References Category:1957 American novels Category:Novels set in San Francisco Category:Chinatown, San Francisco in fiction ","title":"The Flower Drum Song"},{"id":"13066899","text":"The Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI), formerly the Society of Nuclear Medicine, is a nonprofit scientific and professional organization that promotes the science, technology and practical application of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging.

The height of Abaga Falls is approximately twice that of the more famous Maria Cristina Falls also located within the proximity of Iligan City (in barangay Maria Cristina, Baloi municipality). Unlike Maria Cristina Falls, however, which is fed by the Agus river, the water source of Abaga Falls are several underground springs which flow into the top of Abaga Falls via several tributaries. Also unlike the more popular Maria Cristina Falls, human access to Abaga Falls is severely limited due to a current lack of regularly maintained roads as well as the fact that a moderate amount of walking is required to reach the base of the falls. This level of isolation has not protected the ecosystem from damage due to deforestation and over-hunting. The name may have been derived from the Cebuano term \\"abaga\\" which means \\"shoulder\\", possibly relating to the shape and height of the cliff. Flora and fauna There are a number of interesting animals that inhabit the area in and around Abaga Falls. The most notable include; the endangered Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) also commonly known as the \\"monkey-eating eagle\\", the rufous hornbill (Buceros hydrocorax), the endangered giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus) which can only be found in the Philippines, and the Philippine flying lemur (Cynocephalus volans). Many of these animals are either near extinction or in danger of losing their habitats due to human activities.

The classification of glutamate receptors is based on their activation by different pharmacologic agonists. This gene belongs to a family of alpha- amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptors. Alternative splicing at this locus results in several different isoforms which may vary in their signal transduction properties. Interactions GRIA3 has been shown to interact with GRIP1 and PICK1.

This includes 5 subunits of the glutamate receptor: ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptor subunits (Glur2, Glur3, Glur4) and kainate receptor subunits (Glur5, Glur6). Glutamate gated ion channels are made up of four subunits per channel with each subunit contributing to the pore loop structure. The pore loop structure is related to that found in K+ channels (e.g., human Kv1.1 channel). The human Kv1.1 channel pre mRNA is also subject to A to I RNA editing. The function of the glutamate receptors is in the mediation of fast neurotransmission to the brain. The diversity of the subunits is determined, as well as rna splicing by RNA editing events of the individual subunits. This give rise to the necessarily high diversity of these receptors. GluR3 is a gene product of the GRIA3 gene and its pre-mRNA is subject to RNA editing.  Type  A to I RNA editing is catalyzed by a family of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) that specifically recognize adenosines within double-stranded regions of pre- mRNAs and deaminate them to inosine. Inosines are recognised as guanosine by the cells translational machinery. There are three members of the ADAR family ADARs 1-3, with ADAR1 and ADAR2 being the only enzymatically active members. ADAR3 is thought to have a regulatory role in the brain. ADAR1 and ADAR2 are widely expressed in tissues while ADAR3 is restricted to the brain. The double-stranded regions of RNA are formed by base-pairing between residues in the close to region of the editing site with residues usually in a neighboring intron but can be an exonic sequence. The region that base pairs with the editing region is known as an Editing Complementary Sequence (ECS)  Location  The pre-mRNA of this subunit is edited at one position. The R/G editing site is located in exon 13 between the M3 and M4 regions. Editing results in a codon change from an arginine (AGA) to a glycine (GGA). The location of editing corresponds to a bipartite ligand interaction domain of the receptor. The R/G site is found at amino acid 769 immediately before the 38-amino-acid-long flip and flop modules introduced by alternative splicing. Flip and Flop forms are present in both edited and nonedited versions of this protein. The editing complementary sequence (ECS) is found in an intronic sequence close to the exon. The intronic sequence includes a 5' splice site. The predicted double stranded region is 30 base pairs in length. The adenosine residue is mismatched in genomically encoded transcript, however this is not the case following editing. Despite similar sequences to the Q/R site of GluR-B, editing at this site does not occur in GluR-3 pre-mRNA. Editing results in the targeted adenosine, which is mismatched prior to editing in the double-stranded RNA structure to become matched after editing. The intronic sequence involved contains a 5' donor splice site.  Conservation  Editing also occurs in rat.  Regulation  Editing of GluR-3 is regulated in rat brain from low levels in embryonic stage to a large increase in editing levels at birth. In humans, 80-90% of GRIA3 transcripts are edited. The absence of the Q/R site editing in this glutamate receptor subunit is due to the absence of necessary intronic sequence required to form a duplex.  Consequences   Structure  Editing results in a codon change from (AGA) to (GGA), an R to a G change at the editing site.  Function  Editing at R/G site allows for faster recovery from desensitisation. Unedited Glu-R at this site have slower recovery rates. Editing, therefore, allow sustained response to rapid stimuli. A crosstalk between editing and splicing is likely to occur here. Editing takes place before splicing. All AMPA receptors occur in flip and flop alternatively spliced variants. AMPA receptors that occur in the Flop form desenstise faster than the flip form. Editing is also thought to affect splicing at this site.

Kennedy Memorial Park) is an inner-city public park in Galway, Ireland. The park is within the city centre, adjoining the nearby shopping area of William Street and Shop Street. Galway railway station is adjacent to Eyre Square. The park is rectangular, surrounded on three sides by streets that form the major traffic arteries into Galway city centre; the west side of the square was pedestrianised in 2006. History Eyre Square c. 1897 The origin of the square comes from medieval open space in front of a town gate, known as the Green. Markets mostly took place in the northern part of the space. The earliest endeavour to formally enclose it was recorded in 1631. Some ash-trees were planted and the park was enclosed by a wooden fence. The plot of land that became Eyre Square was officially presented to the city in 1710 by Mayor Edward Eyre, from whom it took its name. In 1801, General Meyrick erected a stone wall around the square, which was later known as Meyrick Square.Walsh, P: Discover Galway, pages 102-103. The O'Brien Press Ltd., 2001. In the middle of the 19th century, the whole park underwent a redevelopment in Georgian style. In the 1960s, a full-scale reconstruction started and iron railings were removed and raised around the backyard of St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church. In 1965, the square was officially renamed \\"John F. Kennedy Memorial Park\\" in honour of U.S. President John F. Kennedy; despite the renaming, the square is still widely known as Eyre Square. Kennedy had visited Galway city and made a speech in the square on 29 June 1963, the first U.S. president to do so during his term of office. Controversy A controversial and massively over-budget redevelopment of the square began in 2004. There was considerable unease in the city when it was reported that the original building contractors, Samuel Kingston Construction Ltd, had left the site and were not returning. After many long delays the square finally reopened on 13 April 2006 having astonishingly cost over €20 million to redevelop. Despite an unpopular reception by Galway natives, the finished square received the Irish Landscape Institute Design Award in 2007.  Occupy Galway  Occupy Galway Camp with the famous fountain depicting the Galway Hookers in the background Eyre Square hosted the third longest Occupy Camp in the world, that ran for 216 days consecutively. A small group of concerned Galwegians came together in October 2011, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement that had very quickly spread out across hundreds of cities in the U.S. and the E.U. The main aim was for regular people to set-up a base in their local areas, utilising public spaces to facilitate general assemblies, workshops and debates to discuss and try find solutions to alarming social injustices and lack of accountability amongst states and banking institutions. A mixed group volunteered their time to highlight the perceived wealth divide between those (the 1%) that helped create and profited from the bubble that caused the 2009 banking crash and the 99% that were forced to pay for it. The camp was finally dismantled on 16 May 2013 when a team of local Garda and City Council officials arrived in the early hours to remove the occupiers and reclaim the corner of the square for the impending return of The Ocean Race to Galway. The following year the occupiers held a one-day re-occupy event to mark the removal of the camp that featured a successful local media/billboard campaign to promote and highlight the event. There have been no more Occupy Galway events since. Statues and attractions Galway Hookers in Eyre Square with Browne doorway in background Before the most recent, controversial re-landscaping, the park used to house two large cast-iron cannons which were presented in recognition of the service of the Connaught Rangers, an Irish Regiment in the British Army, in the Crimean War. A statue of Irish language writer Pádraic Ó Conaire was erected in his memory in 1935. There is a portrait bust of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in the park, and a statue of Liam Mellows (1892–1992), a hero of the War of Independence, in the car park to the east of the Browne doorway. The Browne doorway is also another attraction in Eyre Square; it was originally the doorway of the Browne family's home on Lower Abbeygate Street, but was moved in 1905 from Abbeygate Street to Eyre Square. Recently it has had to be shored up, buttressed and encased in plexiglass due to neglect. The name of the Browne family is also featured on one of the fourteen flags near the Browne doorway and the Quincentennial Fountain. These flags represent the Tribes of Galway (Treibheanna na Gaillimhe), fourteen merchant families who dominated the political, commercial, and social life of the city of Galway in western Ireland between the mid-13th and late 19th centuries.

At the age of 14 he volunteered to join the Stasi, and at the age of 18 he became a Stasi cadet. He took the oath as a Stasi officer in September 1989. As a result of the fall of communism and the German reunification, Stasi was dissolved in early 1990 and deemed a criminal organisation. Since German reunification past service in the Stasi has been ground for dismissal in the German public service.Berlin official fired over concealed Stasi past Investigation for membership in a terrorist organisation Moabit Prison, where Holm was incarcerated in 2007 In September 2006, Holm was charged with membership in a terrorist organisation, a violation of § 129a of the German Criminal Code, by the Public Prosecutor General. As a result of the investigation he was arrested on 31 July 2007, and accused of membership in the Militante gruppe (mg), a far-left terrorist organisation accused of carrying out arson attacks in multiple German states. Holm had been placed under observation by the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt or BKA) due to similarities between his own texts and material produced by the Militante gruppe; Holm had also met with known members of the group in a way that was considered to be an indication of \\"conspiratorial\\" behaviour by the prosecutor. On July 31, 2007, Holm's home and office were searched, after a man he had met with was implicated in a plot to firebomb tanks at a German military base. In the course of the search, Holm was taken into custodyArticle in El Pais in Spanish and flown by helicopter to the Federal Court of Justice of Germany (Bundesgerichtshof) in Karlsruhe.

Formed by the addition of Neu! guitarist Michael Rother to Cluster (the duo of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius), they recorded the album from June to November 1973 in Cluster's Forst recording studio. It was self-produced by the group using a primitive mixer and three tape recorders. Background In 1973, Cluster were living in the rural West German village of Forst when Neu! guitarist Michael Rother visited, hoping the duo would serve as a backing band for Neu! live performances. Upon jamming with Moebius and Roedelius, Rother claimed that \\"it was sort of a musical love at first sight, really [...] it was just something I hadn’t experienced before.\\" He dropped his plans and remained in Forst to record with the duo as Harmonia. Rother would also bring some of his equipment, including Farfisa organs, a stereo mixer, and an Elka Drummer One rhythm machine. The LP's pop art-styled sleeve artwork was designed by Moebius and resembles an advertisement for a cleaning fluid.  Releases  It was first released on the Brain Records label in 1974. There was an official CD release from German Polygram in 1992, which was deleted fairly quickly. 1994 saw the appearance of CDs on the Germanofon label. This dubious company, supposedly based in Luxembourg, released numerous Krautrock albums without proper authorization or paying royalties, in effect producing bootlegs that somehow found their way into mainstream distribution. The Germanofon CDs were transfers from vinyl LPs and generally were of inferior sound quality. There were official Japanese releases (again from Polygram) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but the next official Western CD release was not until 23 February 2004 on the Motor Music label, a subsidiary of the Universal Music Group (which had taken over from Polygram in the meanwhile). It was also reissued in 2005 by the Russian label Lilith, and by the Revisited Records label in 2007. Critical reception Ned Raggett's review for AllMusic opens: \\"The debut Harmonia album is at once a product of their source bands and a fine new twist on them, resulting in music that captures what for many is the Krautrock ideal...\\" He adds, \\"...it's at once playful and murky, steady and mechanical, a supergroup of sorts who easily achieves and maintains such a seemingly overstated status by embracing a variety of approaches that work wonders.\\" Uncut named the album and its 1975 successor Deluxe as \\"among the best Krautrock had to offer, gentler than Can or Faust, but with their shimmering keyboards and mechanical rhythms, every bit as compelling. Artforum described the album as \\"a series of sonic vignettes in which the anarchic impulses of Kluster/Cluster were refined and channeled into controlled, Apollonian mechanics and repetitive electronic melodies with soft, synthetic textures.\\" Pitchfork stated that the group's debut \\"was a precise meeting of their constituent parts—Roedelius’ eerie beauty, Möbius’ sense of tension, Rother’s cool exploration—with each member contributing to the sound equally.\\" It was Musik von Harmonia that reportedly had Brian Eno proclaiming that Harmonia was \\"the world's most important rock band\\" at the time. Daniel Dumych writes: \\"Perhaps Eno's reason for praising Harmonia so highly was that their music fit the requirements of ambient rock. Its music was equally suitable for active or passive listening. The careful listener found his/her attentions rewarded by the musical activities and sounds, but Harmonia's music was also capable of setting a sonic environment.\\" Musician, writer, and rock historian Julian Cope includes Musik von Harmonia in his Top 50 Krautrock albums.

Assumptions of Terzaghi's Principle  # The soil is homogenous (uniform in composition throughout) and isotropic (show same physical property in each direction). # The soil is fully saturated (zero air voids due to water content being so high). # The solid particles are incompressible. # Compression and flow are one-dimensional (vertical axis being the one of interest). # Strains in the soil are relatively small. # Darcy's Law is valid for all hydraulic gradients. # The coefficient of permeability and the coefficient of volume compressibility remain constant throughout the process. # There is a unique relationship, independent of time, between the void ratio and effective stress  Validity  Though the first 5 assumptions are either likely to hold, or deviation will have no discernible effect, experimental results contradict the final 3. Darcy's Law does not seem to hold at high hydraulic gradients, and both the coefficients of permeability and volume compressibility decrease during consolidation. This is due to the non-linearity of the relationship between void ratio and effective stress, although for small stress increments assumption 7 is reasonable. Finally, the relationship between void ratio and effective stress is not independent of time, again proven by experimental results.

The church was founded in dedication to Saint Vincent of Saragossa, and constitutes a national monument of France. It was built in a mix of Roman and Gothic styles during the episcopacy of Jean de Châtillon (1146-1163) on the site of an ancient church founded in the 7th-century. The cathedral suffered damage during WW2 when the steeple toppled onto the Sacred Heart Chapel. An organ which had been built in 1893 by Louis Debierre was destroyed. On 21 May 1972, after twenty-eight years of work, a ceremony was held to celebrate the completion of the restoration. Early history Historical records of the rocky outcrop on which Saint-Malo stands show that a hermit called Aaron d'Aleth founded a hermitage there towards the middle of the 6th-century. A Welsh monk called Maclow or Mac Law or Malo arrived to the rock and joined Aaron. Malo devoted himself to preaching and in due course became Bishop of Aleth (Saint-Servan) He was succeeded by Saint Gurval who had a church built in honour of his predecessor. This church, burnt by Charlemagne's lieutenants in 811, was rebuilt in 816 by bishop Hélocar and was given the name of the deacon saint Vincent d'Espagne who had been martyred in 304 by Diocletian. In the middle of the 9th-century, the Breton king Nominoë nominated Aleth as the location of the episcopacy and called it \\"Pagus Alethensis\\". The Norman invasions of the 10th-century left the church in ruins. In 1108 it was gifted to the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Martin de Marmoutier in Touraine who converted the church into a priory. Jean de Châtillon, the Saint-Malo bishop, retook the church after a long struggle and rebuilt it completely around 1152, making it a cathedral and calling it Saint-Malo. He also transferred the episcopacy from Aleth to Saint-Malo-de-l'Isle (on the \\"rocher of Aaron\\"). This action created an episcopal area which included the ancient parish of Saint- Servan. In this period the ecclesiastical authority dominated the town but by the beginning of the 13th-century the Dukes of Brittany started to scheme about retaking Saint-Malo Cathedral and in the following centuries Saint-Malo was to be embroiled in many international and dynastic struggles. Later history Several elements of de Châtillon's 12th-century building remain today including part of the cloisters, the nave and the transept crossing. The choir was constructed in the 13th-century and the construction of the tower started in the 12th-century, and was finished in 1422. The south side of the cathedral and the three chapels in the choir area date to the 15th-century. Between 1583 and 1607 the north side of the cathedral was reconstructed and the north transept enlarged. In the 18th-century the south chapel was built and the façade of the cathedral was reconstructed between 1772 and 1773. A door, previously kept in the courtyard of the Hôtel-Dieu in the rue Saint- Sauveur, was brought to the cathedral in the early 17th-century and a portal from the Chapelle Sainte-Anne-des-Ursulines was placed in the south-west of the cathedral. The cathedral was the ancient bishopric of Saint Malo from the year 1146 until 1801, when the Concordat of 1801 abolished that bishopric and divided its territory between the Rennes, Saint-Brieuc and Vannes bishoprics. In 1146, Jean de Châtillon, who had been the bishop of Aleth since 1144, transferred his bishopric to Saint-Malo which was considered more secure a base than Aleth and it was in 1146 that Pope Eugène III agreed to the transfer. The monastery of Saint Malo which had been founded in 1108 became de Châtillon's official residence and the monastery became a cathedral replacing the previous cathedral of Saint-Pierre at Aleth. Thus was born the cathédrale de Saint-Malo Jean de Châtillon was also known as \\"Jean de la Grille\\" as when he was buried in the cathedral his tomb needed a grill installed to ward off his many fervent admirers. The interior The layout of the cathedral follows that of the Latin cross. The vaulting of the choir and the south aisle is ogival (gothic), the vaulting for the north aisle is groin vaulting and the ceiling of the south chapel is decked with modern paneling. The relics of Jean de Châtillon Overlooking the ambulatory is a stone 12th-century sarcophagus containing the relics of Jean de Châtillon, the first bishop of Saint-Malo. The relics of Saint Célestin At the base of the chevet is a chest containing the relics of a 2nd-century martyr Saint Célestin, given by the pope Pie VII to Saint-Malo's last bishop Monseigneur Courtois de Pressigny. The tower and the role of Abbé Jean-François Huchet In 1422 rebuilding of the tower was started using the foundations of the earlier tower. In August 1858 Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie were passing through Saint-Malo and were persuaded by Abbé Jean-François Huchet to finance the addition of an arrow to the tower spire which would be visible from the sea. There is a statue of Abbé Jean-François Huchet in the cathedral by Jean-Marie Valentin. The statue stands on the south side of the ambulatory. The tower was completely destroyed during the 1944 bombing but replaced in 1972. The new tower's design was based on a Norman church in Périers. The tower has four bells:- \\"Jean de Châtillon\\" which chimes the note \\"re\\". The bell weighs 1.500 kg and was blessed on 16 September 1894, \\"Jacques Cartier\\" which chimes the note \\"do\\". The bell weighs 2.550 kg and was blessed on16 September 1894, \\"Noguette\\" which chimes the note \\"si\\". The bell weighs 1750 kg. It was recast and blessed on 12 November 1989, \\"Gros Malo\\" which chimes the note \\"si-flat\\". The bell weighs 3.500 kg. It was recast and blessed on 17 July 1994 The gisant of de La Chouë de La Mettrie This gisant in the cathedral dates to the 15th-century. De La Chouë de La Mettrie had been a distinguished \\"seigneur\\" and one of the cathedral's benefactors. Francesco Maria Schiaffino The statues of \\"La Foi\\", Saint Maur (Saint Maurus) and Saint Benoit (Benoît de Nursie) in the cathedral are the work of Francesco Maria Schiaffino from Genoa. They date to 1743 and came from an old Benedictine church which subsequently became the Saint-Malo \\"Palais de Justice\\"(French pronunciation: [palɛ də ʒystis]; '\\"Palace of Justice\\"). Pulpit In the south nave is a wooden pulpit which dates to the 18th century which miraculously survived the 1944 bombing. The fountain On the west face of the arm of the north transept, there is a fountain known as the \\"Fontaine Saint-Jean\\" or \\"Saint-Côme\\" which was restored in 1719. The transept wings The Saint-Côme wing on the north façade was designed and built by the architect Thomas Poussin between 1593 and 1607. The wing on the south side is known as the \\"Saint Julien wing\\" and was built between 1461 and 1486. This wing has an entrance door known as the \\"Porte de Velours\\" which was added in 1851. Poussin came from Dinan. He also worked on military installations in Dinan and Saint-Malo and participated in the building of the \\"Palais du Parlement de Bretagne\\" from 1624 to 1631. The chapels off the north ambulatory These three chapels are the Chapelle Notre-Dame de la Délivrance or de Port de Salut which dates to 1530, the Chapelle Notre-Dame of 1560 and the Chapelle-Saint-Denis, du Théologat or de l'Ascension which dates to 1600. One of these chapels had originally belonged to the \\"Confrérie des Hommes Blancs\\". The stalls The stalls and the pulpit date to the 18th-century and one gisant in the cathedral dates to the 13th-century. There is an old baptismal font of 12th-century origin and a 19th-century baldaquin. Statuary The wooden statue titled \\"Notre-Dame de la Croix du Fief\\" dates to the 17th-century and the statue \\"Notre-Dame de la Consolation\\". The reliquary containing Jacques Cartier's skull is in the neighbouring chapel. The tomb of Canon Troussier Troussier was the \\"grand-chantre\\" who died in 1475 and his tomb can be seen in the cathedral. The 1944 bombing The city of Saint Malo suffered much bombing and artillery fire by both Germans and Americans during fighting in early August 1944. Shells fired from a German minesweeper on 6 August decapitated the cathedral steeple which toppled onto the Sacred Heart Chapel causing huge damage. One of the casualties was an old organ which had been built in 1893 by Louis Debierre. On 21 May 1972, after twenty-eight years of work, a ceremony was held to celebrate the completion of the cathedral's restoration which had been masterminded by Raymond Cornon and Pierre Prunet, the then official architects for historic monuments. Cornon also worked on reconstructions in Fougères, Rennes, Quimper, Vannes, Nantes and Vitré. The main altar A view of the dramatic bronze high altar. On the left side we see the winged bull and on the right side the lion The bronze high altar in the cathedral was consecrated on 8 December 1991 and was the work of the painter Arcabas and Étienne Pirot. The theme of the altar is the tetramorph or the four Evangelists appearing in animal form. The four Evangelists are winged, the wing being an ancient symbol of divinity with each representing the virtues required for Christian salvation. The lion of St Mark represents courage, resurrection, and royalty. The ox, or bull, is an ancient Christian symbol of redemption and life through sacrifice and signifies Luke’s records of Christ as a priest and his ultimate sacrifice for the future of humanity. The eagle of John represents the sky, heavens, and the human spirit. Matthew's emblem is a man. These four symbols first appear in the book of Ezekiel as the four animals pulling the chariot of Ezekiel's vision (Ezekiel 1. 1-14) and later in St John's Apocalypse (Apoc 4; 7-8), later being adopted by the Church as the emblems of the four Evangelists. The lion for Mark, the bull for Luke, the eagle for John and a man for Matthew. The high altar furnishings include desks, an armchair and two stools, an elaborately carved stoup and a candlestick. The cathedral organ The pipe organ was made by Koenig factors, father and son, built in 1977 and inaugurated in 1980. It is composed of four keyboards and one pedal and 35 stops. This organ replaced an older one (1893) built by the Nantes born Louis Debierre in the romantic style, which was destroyed in 1944. A new choir organ of two keyboards, one pedal and 18 stops has been also built by Koenig in 2014.newspaper report, in Ouest-France (accessed February 7, 2015) Stained glass windows in the nave The stained glass windows are the work of Max Ingrand, continued by the Michel Durand atelier. They depict scenes chronicling the history of the city and the cathedral. On the south side of the nave are two windows. One depicts the arrival of the Welsh monk Malo in about 560 at Aaron's hermitage. A small chapel still marks the spot where the hermitage stood \\"La Chapelle Saint- Aaron\\". The second window shows Jacques Cartier being blessed by the bishop as he leaves on a voyage in 1535 that would lead to the discovery of Canada. On the north side of the nave are three windows. One celebrates the martyrdom in 304 of Vincent of Saragossa the patron of the cathedral. Another celebrates the foundation of the See of Saint-Malo by Jean de Châtillon in 1152 and the third the Tro-Breiz pilgrimage to the relics of the seven founders of the Breton bishoprics. Above the main door, hidden by the organ, stained glass depicts the Assumption of the Virgin. (\\"l'Assomption de ls Sainte Vierge\\"). La Chapelle Saint-Aaron The Great Rose window and other stained glass The Great Rose window was the 1968 work of the architect Raymond Cornon and replaced the great rose window destroyed in 1693 during an attack on the cathedral by the English. On the north side of the building, there is a 1970 stained glass window by Jean Gouremelin and Michel Durand which depicts Paul Aurélien, Tugdual, Corentin, Malo, Guillaume, Samson and Patern. Other windows in the choir, the chevet, the ambulatory and the transept were the work of Jean Le Moal and Bernard Allain. Some of the great Breton saints: Paul Aurélien, Tugdual, Corentin, Malo, Guillaume, Samson and Patern The transept The arms of the transept date to 1623 and contain four windows.

It is decked with flowers on 15 August, the day of celebration of the statue's existence This 15th-century marble statue is greatly venerated by the people of Saint-Malo and is also known as the \\"Miraculeuse Protectrice de la Cité Malouine\\", as it was associated over the years with various legends and miracles. For hundreds of years, the statue had in fact been placed in a niche over one of the entrances through the city's defensive wall, this until 2003 when the statue was restored and placed inside the cathedral by the entrance to the sacristy to protect it from the elements. A copy was made and this is still kept in the defensive wall niche Jacques Cartier The cathedral holds the tomb of the great explorer Jacques Cartier who was born in St Malo on 31 December 1491 and died there on 1 September 1557. The tomb is in a chapel off the ambulatory and north of the choir. In 1949 the original grave had been found during the course of excavations and moved to its present location. It was Cartier who claimed what is now known as Canada for France. He was the first European to describe and map the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the shores of the Saint Lawrence River. It was in 1534 that he made his first voyage, two years after the Duchy of Brittany was formally united with France in the Edict of Union. Cartier had been introduced to King Francis I by Jean Le Veneur, bishop of Saint-Malo and abbot of Mont-Saint-Michel, at the Manoir de Brion and encouraged the king to pick Cartier to head the next major voyage to explore the eastern coast of North America on behalf of France. After several important voyages to North America, Cartier spent the rest of his life in Saint-Malo and his nearby estate, where he was often useful as an interpreter in Portuguese. He died at the age 65 on September 1, 1557, during an epidemic, possibly of typhus, though many sources list his cause of death as unknown.

The plaque records that Honoré Mercier the Prime Minister of Quebec visited the cathedral in 1891. René Duguay-Trouin René Duquay-Trouin is another famous malouin who is buried in the cathedral. He was initially buried in the Saint-Roch church in Paris but his remains were moved to Saint-Malo on the three hundred year anniversary of his birth. He had a brilliant privateering and naval career and eventually became \\"Lieutenant-General of the Naval Armies of the King\\" (i.e. admiral) (French: Lieutenant-Général des armées navales du roi), and a Commander in the Order of Saint-Louis. Ten ships of the French Navy were named in his honour. The old Cathedral of Saint-Pierre at Aleth Ruins of Saint-Servan Cathédrale Saint-Pierre d'Aleth All that is left of the original cathedral at Aleth are ruins as seen in the photograph shown here. When in 1144 the bishopric was transferred to Saint Malo, Aleth put itself under the protection of Saint-Servan. Capitals in the nave and transept Several of the capitals of the pillars supporting the roof of the nave and transept crossing have carvings that are both grotesque and biblical. These capitals, not easily visible from the ground due to their height, date to the 12th-century. Stations of the Cross There is a \\"Chemin de Croix\\" (Stations of the cross) in the cathedral by Henri Chaumont. Tro Breizh Tro Breizh (Breton for \\"Tour of Brittany\\") is a Catholic pilgrimage that links the towns of the seven founding saints of Brittany. These seven saints were Celtic monks from Britain from around the 5th or 6th century who brought Christianity to Armorica and founded its first bishoprics. The tour originally was a month-long 600 km (370 mi) walking tour, but when relaunched in 1994 by Les Chemins du Tro Breizh (\\"The Paths of the Tro Breizh\\" in French), it was decided to limit the tour to one week-long stage every year, still following the original path: The seven towns are:- Quimper, Saint Corentin's town Saint-Pol-de-Léon, Saint Pol's town Tréguier, Saint Tudwal's town Saint-Brieuc, named after its founder Brioc Saint Malo, similarly named for Malo Dol, Samson of Dol's town. Cathédrale Saint-Samson de Dol Vannes, Saint Patern's town.Église Saint-Patern de Vannes An old Breton legend says that those who do not complete the Tro Breizh in their lifetime will be sentenced to complete it in their afterlife, walking the length of the tour from within their coffin every seven years. One of the stained-glass windows in the cathedral by Max Legrand is dedicated to Tro Breizh. Famous people associated with the cathedral Amongst those baptised in the cathedral are François-Rene de Chateaubriand, François Broussais and Félicité Robert de Lamennais as well as René Duguay-Trouin. Chateaubriand wrote in \\"Mémoires d' Outre-Tombe\\" in 1859 \\"Lorsque dans l'hiver, les rafales de Noël ébranlent les voûtes de cette nef que fit résonner la mâle poitrine de Jaques Cartier et Duguay-Trouin j'éprouvais en sentiment extraordinaire de religion\\" Rene Duguay-Trouin and Robert Surcouf were \\"privateers\\", men who received \\"letters of marque\\" from the king, which permitted them to attack warships or merchantmen without being treated as pirates.

The intent is to characterize the reproduction chain for the mass transfer of coarse-groove records to digital media, much like using a photographic calibration reference in image work. Libraries and archives around the world have collections of many thousands of coarse-groove mechanical audio recordings, phonograph or gramophone records, largely 78s or 78 revolutions per minute (rpm) discs. This is a substantial recorded heritage of mankind's music and spoken word made over a period of 65 years. The 78 rpm disc was largely out of production by 1960. These mechanical recordings won't be available indefinitely since the plastics used in their manufacture are deteriorating slowly but steadily. Preservation programs have been underway by a number of organizations. Decreasing costs of digital storage media now make it possible to consider all mechanical audio recordings for transfer to the digital domain. Thus a widespread need was recognized by the Audio Engineering Society (AES) to provide a calibration tool for standard transfer of mechanical coarse-groove audio recordings from the analog to the digital domain.Audio Engineering Society Standards Committee, AES 78 rpm Calibration Disc Set (last updated 2007-07-20).

A Closer Look At The Preservation Problem According to Ted Kendall, maker of the Front End audio restoration unit also known as \\"The Mousetrap\\", the equalization time constants for post-1955 78s used in the Front End are 3180/450/50 ms.Kendall, Ted. The Front End-EQ Settings, 1996. These time constants are identical to those used in the AES Coarse-groove Calibration Discs. Since the 78 rpm record would be obsolete by 1960, this means that there is a very large population of pre-1955 78s requiring different equalization settings depending on the vintage and label of the disc. :Type of Recording: Equalizer Settings :Acoustic recordings (pre-1925): Flat/AC/AC :FFRR 78s: Flat/636/25 :EMI 78s 1945-1955: Flat/636/Flat :Most other UK 78s 1925-1945: Flat/531/Flat :Post-1955 78s: 3180/450/50 :BBC direct recordings 1945-1960: Flat/BBC/BBC :CCIR standard coarse-groove transcriptions: Flat/450/50 :AES (some early US Lps): Flat/400/63.6 :Modern LPs (RIAA equalization): 3180/318/75 :Lateral cut NAB transcriptions: 2250/250/100 :Vertical cut NAB transcriptions: Flat/531/40* :Western Electric 78s: Flat 531/Flat* :*Adjustments needed* So, the dilemma is this: should coarse-groove recordings be transferred in mass to digital using an arbitrary phonoequalization curve such as with the AES calibration discs, or should each recording be matched to the curve appropriate to its vintage and label, then transferred to digital media? Use of RIAA Equalization Because the RIAA equalization standard has been in use internationally for phonograph records since 1953 and is based on recording practices used for many years by RCA Victor, a dominant record producer, the electronics needed for this purpose are as readily available as record players are. For vintage recordings the Esoteric Sound Re-Equalizer can readily be connected as a standard item to the record playback equipment.Esoteric Sound, 4813 Wallbank Ave., Downers Grove, Illinois 60515 The Re-Equalizer is used to modify RIAA. Then, depending on the vintage and label of the 78 rpm record, the appropriate equalizer bass turnover and treble rolloff settings can be easily looked up in a reference guide.Powell, James R., Jr. and Randall G.

The second warship to be named Agawam by the Navy, AOG-6 was laid down on 7 September 1942 at Savage, Minnesota, by Cargill, Inc.; launched on 6 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. George F. Jacobs; and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 18 December 1943, Lt. John W. Foster in command.  World War II service  After a period of alterations and fitting out, the gasoline tanker left Galveston, Texas, on 24 January 1944, bound for the Pacific Ocean. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 1 March and continued on to Tulagi. As a member of Service Squadron (ServRon) 8, Agawam was based at that island in the Solomons for the next 10 months servicing Allied facilities located throughout the island group.  Supporting the Philippine invasion  In September, Agawam began a 27-day availability at Espiritu Santo and resumed her operations at Tulagi on 25 October. The gasoline tanker was detached from ServRon 8 on 28 January 1945 and got underway for Lingayen Gulf, Philippines. Upon her arrivalthere on 1 March, she was assigned to Service Force, U.S. 7th Fleet, and for the next month engaged in routine operations between Manila, Subic Bay, and Lingayen Gulf.  On loan to the U.S. Army  On 1 April, Agawam was transferred, on loan, to the U.S. Army for the support of its land- based forces. She delivered aviation and motor gasoline to Army forces for two months in lower Lingayen Gulf and subsequently performed the same services at Manila for three months.  Post-war activity  A fortnight after Japan capitulated, the tanker was ordered to Tokyo. Routed via Okinawa, she reached Yokohama on 18 September and spent the next month there fueling Army installations ashore. On 25 October, the ship reported to Shanghai, China, for fueling operations at bases located along the Huangpu River. She got underway to return to Japan on 26 November and moored at Nagasaki on the 28th. The gasoline tanker remained actively engaged in logistic support of the occupation forces in Japan through January 1946. The ship was then returned to Navy custody and got underway on the 28th for the voyage back to the United States.  Stateside overhaul  Upon her arrival at San Pedro, California, Agawam entered a shipyard for overhaul. Back in top shape, she sailed for Guam on 1 July and served as a station ship at that island until June 1949. During this period she made voyages to various ports in Japan; to Saipan; to Iwo Jima; to Shanghai, China; and to Truk.  Based out of Pearl Harbor  In June 1949, Agawam switched her base of operations to Pearl Harbor. She carried gasoline to Alaska and various islands in the Central Pacific. On 13 November 1953, the tanker sailed for the Philippine Islands and served in that archipelago through April 1954. Agawam then returned to Pearl Harbor and continued operating from that base supporting American installations throughout the Central Pacific. On 22 November 1956, Agawam left Hawaii, bound for San Diego.  Inactivation and decommissioning  Upon her arrival, she began a pre-inactivation overhaul. Agawam was placed out of commission, in reserve, at San Diego, on 31 January 1957. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1960, and the ship was transferred to the Maritime Administration, and she was placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet and laid up at Olympia, Washington. She was sold to Levin Metals in October 1975, presumably for scrapping.

Dilapan-S (left). Laminaria (right) Osmotic dilators are medical implements used to dilate the uterine cervix by swelling as they absorb fluid from surrounding tissue. They may be composed of natural or synthetic materials. A laminaria stick or tent is a thin rod made of the stems of dried Laminaria, a genus of kelp. Laminaria sticks can be generated from Laminaria japonica and Laminaria digitata. Synthetic osmotic dilators are commonly referred to by their brand names, such as Dilapan. Dilapan-S are composed of polyacrylonitrile, a plastic polymer. The hygroscopic nature of the polymer causes the dilator to absorb fluid and expand.  Use in obstetrics and gynecology  Osmotic dilators are most commonly used to slowly dilate and soften the cervix prior to surgical abortion, a process referred to as cervical preparation. Adequate cervical preparation is important prior to surgical abortions because it helps to prevent complications of dilation and evacuation (D&E;), such as laceration of the cervix. Cervical preparation can be accomplished with osmotic dilators, with medications such as prostaglandins and/or mifepristone, or with a combination of these. However, there is no consensus as to which cervical preparation method is superior in terms of safety and efficacy. At later gestational ages, osmotic dilators, including laminaria, may be used to assist in dilating the cervix. Most abortion providers use laminaria, Dilapan, or both for osmotic dilation prior to surgical abortion after 16–18 weeks gestation. Osmotic dilators may also be used to achieve cervical dilation prior to gynecology procedures, such as hysteroscopy or dilation and curettage of the non-pregnant uterus, although this is uncommon.  Placement  Osmotic dilators after soaking in water for 24 hours. Dilapan-S (left). Laminaria (right). This does not represent the amount of expansion that will be occur when used in humans. Prior to a planned surgical abortion, osmotic dilator(s) may be inserted into a woman's cervix. A speculum is placed in the vagina to allow the provider to see the uterine cervix. A tenaculum may be placed on the anterior lip of the cervix to straighten the cervical canal and hold the cervix steady. Pain medications may be administered via a paracervical block. The dilator is then grasped with a ring forcep and is placed into the cervix so that it spans both the internal cervical os and external cervical os. Over time, the osmotic dilator absorbs fluid and swells to 3-4 times the initial diameter. Most of the increase in size occurs within 6 hours after the dilator are placed in the cervix, though further expansion will continue over 12–24 hours. The number of osmotic dilators placed depends on the degree of cervical dilation that is sought. This may be affected by the gestational age of the pregnancy and history of prior vaginal deliveries. More dilators are generally used with advancing gestational age. Laminaria tents are usually left in place overnight.  Mechanism of action  Laminaria function by absorbing fluid from the surrounding tissue and expanding. Thus exerts radial pressure on the cervix. They also cause the release of prostaglandins.  Removal  Laminaria are removed prior to initiating the D&E;, after they have started the process of dilating the cervix. They are removed by grasping the strings of the dilator and applying gentle traction. The cervix may be dilated further using rigid cervical dilators which serially increase in diameter.  Effectiveness There is no evidence regarding the risk of not achieving vaginal delivery within 24 hours with laminaria compared to prostaglandin E2 but there may be a lower risk of uterine hyperstimulation with laminaria. It is not certain whether the risks of caesarian section, perinatal death or maternal death are reduced or increased with laminaria compared with vaginal or cervical prostaglandin E2.  Risks  The incidence of complications related to osmotic dilator use prior to abortion has not been systematically studied and reported, but serious complications appear to be very rare. Risks of osmotic dilator insertion include pain, rupture of amniotic membranes, initiation of labor, cervical or uterine perforation, retention of the dilator, and infection. Original Dilapan dilators were prone to fracturing under tension during removal which sometimes led to retention of dilator fragments within the uterus. Dilapan was subsequently removed from the market and replaced with Dilapan-S which is less prone to fragmentation. Dilapan may expand unevenly within the cervix and develop a dumbbell shape which can result in difficult removal.

Earnings had declined to US$260 million in 1986, but were recovering by the end 1987. However, the stock price reached an all-time peak that year, which was not surpassed for the next decade, as the company ran into troubles through the early 1990s. In 1986, Pinnacle acquired MeraBank, a savings and loan. It grew to become Arizona's largest thrift, with $6.5 billion in assets. However, the thrift was seized by federal regulators in January 1990, due in part to the deterioration in prices in the Arizona real estate market.U.S. Seizes Arizona's Biggest Savings Institution New York Times February 1, 1990 A Reckoning for the Utility High Rollers New York Times July 29, 1990 By 1990, the company's earnings had fallen to under US$100 million, as it struggled through the 1990-1991 recession, as well as a series of failed attempts to diversify. By 1991, the company was facing a loss of almost US$190 million, and discontinued paying its dividend. APS and its predecessors had paid a dividend without interruption since 1920. The stock price plunged 85% from its 1987 peak, to its lowest level in over twenty years. Its long-term debt by then reached over US$2.5 billion. However, by 1992, the company returned to profitability, as earnings recovered to over US$150 million. The stock price tripled from its 1991 low by the end of 1993. The company reinstated its dividend that year. By 1995, Pinnacle West Capital had been added to the S&P; MidCap 400 index.

Pippo, was born on September 11, 1920 in Capua (Caserta), the son of Fernando Ducceschi and Matilde Bonaccio. The family originated in Pistoia, the town in which Manrico grew up and completed his studies until he went to university at the Faculty of Lettere e Filosofia (Arts). He was however forced to interrupt his studies with the onset of World War II. After the armistice of September 8, 1943, the Italian Army dissolved and he was able to walk home from Tarquinia, skirting the main roads in order to avoid capture by the Germans. Thanks to the military experience acquired in the Alpini Cadet Officer Course he had attended, he immediately got in touch with the Florentinian branch of the Giustizia e Libertà (Justice and Liberty) movement, and formed a mobile group of partisans with the purpose of hampering German military operations in Italy. His exceptional leadership abilities inspired teams of young people to join his ranks, forming one of the most organized and combative partisan formations in Italy. The XI Partisan Zone was one of the very few Resistance outfits that did not suffer any military defeat. Ducceschi's role in partisan activities put him at the top of the Germans' \\"most wanted\\" list, endangering not only himself but also his relatives, who were forced to go into hiding for the rest of the war. Loved by his people, \\"Pippo\\" was one of the few to arrive to Milan with his team. He was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal by the Allies due to the aid he supplied to the Anglo-American Forces. In spite of this, Ducceschi's contributions were never officially acknowledged by either partisan organizations, mostly led by communist militants, or the Italian State. His threats to denounce certain abuses committed by members of the Resistance were never fulfilled, as he was found hanged in his house in Lucca on August 26, 1948. His death was officially ruled out as suicide, although Ducceschi's closest friends were never fully convinced and the subject remains controversial.

The QEII cares for adult patients (19+ yrs). Pediatric patients (0-18 yrs) within the region are cared for at the IWK Health Centre. Administratively, the QEII is part of the Nova Scotia Health Authority. History The Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre was formed by a provincial government order in council during a health care administration reorganization in 1994. The amalgamation was formalized by legislation in 1995-96. The current hospital is an amalgamation of four formerly independent hospitals and health care centres; the Victoria General Hospital, the Camp Hill Medical Centre, the Cancer Treatment Research Foundation, and the Nova Scotia Rehabilitation Centre. The former Halifax Infirmary and Camp Hill Hospital had previously merged to form the Camp Hill Medical Centre in 1988. The Halifax Infirmary was established by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul in 1886 with a new building constructed at the intersection of Queen and Morris Streets in 1933. The Sisters of Charity operated the hospital until it was taken over by the provincial government in 1973. Until 1973, the Halifax Infirmary functioned largely as the city's Roman Catholic hospital. The building was closed when the present Halifax Infirmary on Summer Street opened in 1998; the \\"new Infirmary\\" has consolidated all emergency and outpatient services for the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, eliminating duplication between the Infirmary and Victoria General. Camp Hill Hospital was founded by the Canadian military in 1917 as temporary lodgings for casualties of the First World War. It was constructed on the east side of Robie Street across from Cherry Street and was expanded repeatedly throughout the years. In 1971 the City of Halifax founded the Abbie J. Lane hospital adjacent to Camp Hill on the corner of Jubilee Road (now Veteran's Memorial Lane) and Summer Street. In 1987 the Camp Hill Veterans' Memorial building was opened, and the original Camp Hill facilities were subsequently demolished. The new Veteran's Memorial Building, the Abbie J. Lane Hospital, and the Halifax Infirmary on Queen Street were merged to form the Camp Hill Medical Centre. By 1992, planning had begun for construction of the new Halifax Infirmary building to replace the aging Queen Street facilities and relocate the Infirmary to the Camp Hill Medical Centre Summer Street campus. VG hospital ward, 1910 Notman Studio The Victoria General Hospital was established in 1887 by the City of Halifax and the provincial government when the former City and Provincial Hospital at the same site (Peter McGuigan, The Historic South End Halifax) was renamed; the City and Provincial Hospital having been established in 1859. In 1948 a new Victoria General Hospital was opened immediately east of the land which would eventually become home to the IWK Health Centre, a children's hospital, on a block bounded by Tower Road, University Avenue and South Street and was the largest hospital in the province in terms of both staff and bed capacity. A hospital parking area was established in the lot between Tower Road and South Park Street; in the 1980s the lot was expanded to physically join with the hospital facilities, effectively dividing Tower Road into two sections north and south of the facility. Historically, \\"the VG\\", as it is called, was aligned with the Dalhousie University Faculty of Medicine as the province's only teaching hospital. The Victoria General Hospital's emergency and outpatient services were closed and consolidated at the new Infirmary site in 1998. The pipes in some parts of the QEII have been contaminated with legionella bacteria since the 1980s, which has rendered water in some buildings undrinkable. Physical components Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre - Bethune Building (foreground); Centennial Building is visible in the background The QEII Health Sciences Centre is spread across 10 buildings, which now comprise two geographically separate campuses (formally termed \\"sites\\") on the Halifax Peninsula. * Halifax Infirmary site buildings with amenities and serviceshttp://www.cdha.nshealth.ca/about-us/our-facilities/qeii-health- sciences-centre ** Abbie J.

It involved the construction of series of 21st century landmarks, or Panopticons (structures providing a comprehensive view), across East Lancashire, England, as symbols of the renaissance of the area. Four large scale sculptures were commissioned, designed and constructed over a six-year period for the districts of Blackburn, Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale. The Halo in Haslingden (Rossendale) was the last sculpture in the series to be erected, in September 2007. Plans for a similar sculpture in Accrington were never realised. One artist's impression showed a different design. Sculptures The Atom Set in the landscape of Pendle, the Atom was designed by Peter Meacock, Andrew Edmunds and Katarina Novomestska of Peter Meacock Projects. It was launched by Mayor of Pendle, Councillor George Adams, with Anthony Wilson and designer Peter Meacock, on 22 September 2006. The bronze coated glass fiber reinforced concrete structure provides both a work of art and a viewing point and shelter from which to enjoy the surrounding landscape. Part of this sculpture has since been vandalised and removed. Atom is located at .

Hayes Richard Francis Hayes (1878–1958) was an Irish politician, historian and medical doctor. He was a volunteer and fought in the Easter Rising in 1916 and was involved in the Garristown and Ashbourne fighting. He was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for Limerick East at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn Féin MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to attend the British House of Commons and instead assembled in the Mansion House, Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called Dáil Éireann. Hayes could not attend as he was imprisoned by the British authorities at the time. During the War of Independence he was interned in the Curragh Camp. He was elected at the 1921 elections as a Sinn Féin Teachta Dála (TD) for Limerick City–Limerick East and was released after the truce. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted in favour of it. He was re-elected at the 1922 general election as a pro-Treaty Sinn Féin TD and subsequently as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD at the 1923 general election. He resigned from the Dáil in January 1924 and retired from politics. He later became Irish Film Censor (1941–54) and Director of the Abbey Theatre. As a historian, he was a leading authority on Irish connections with France from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. He authored several major historical studies, including The Last Invasion of Ireland: When Connacht Rose (1st ed. 1937), which has been reappraised by Guy Beiner as a groundbreaking book for its use of oral traditions alongside more conventional archival sources. Other titles include Ireland and Irishmen in the French Revolution (1932), Irish Swordsmen of France (1934), Old Irish Links with France (1940), and Biographical Dictionary of Irishmen in France (1949), alongside numerous articles. For his work on the Irish military in France he received the Légion d'honneur. He was a hard-working and much-loved doctor, and apparently a very good one. Frank O'Connor records that he deduced, correctly, that their mutual friend George William Russell had terminal cancer simply because Russell (who had moved to England) in a letter to O'Connor complained of what he believed to be colitis. When O'Connor showed Hayes the letter he read it quickly and said \\"I am sorry but that is cancer, not colitis.\\" For several years he was the closest friend of Frank O'Connor, who acknowledged the extraordinary help Hayes gave him in researching The Big Fellow, his biography of Michael Collins. After some years, however, the friendship cooled, and the portrait of Hayes in O'Connor's memoir My Father's Son, is surprisingly unflattering, given their earlier closeness. He is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery.

Ruled by the Orontid dynasty, the kingdom was culturally mixed with Greek, Armenian, Iranian, Syrian, Anatolian and Roman influences. Founded around the 3rd century BC the kingdom maintained independence until when the Artaxiad king Tigranes the Great conquered the territories as part of his empire. Attempts to restore the kingdom were briefly made in 66 BC and 54 AD. Sophene laid near medieval Kharput, which is present day Elazig.  Etymology  The etymology of the name Sophene dates back to the ethnonym Suppani, a people who lived in the region dating back to the 1st millennium BCE. The , was coined after the Armenian Cop'k, which stems from Suppani.  History  Sophene was part of the kingdom of Urartu in the 8th-7th centuries BC. After unifying the region with his kingdom in the early 8th century BC, king Argishti I of Urartu resettled many of its inhabitants to his newly built city of Erebuni. After Alexander the Great's campaigns in 330s BC and the subsequent collapse of the Achaemenid Empire, it became one of the first regions of Armenia to be exposed to Greek influence and adopted some aspects of Greek culture. Sophene remained part of the newly independent kingdom of Greater Armenia. Around the 3rd century BC, the Seleucid Empire forced Sophene to split from Greater Armenia, giving rise to the Kingdom of Sophene. The kingdom was ruled by a branch of the Orontids. The kingdom's capital was Carcathiocerta, identified as the now abandoned town-site of Egil on the Tigris river north of Diyarbakir. However, its largest settlement and only true city was Arsamosata, located further to the north. Arsamosata was founded in the 3rd century B.C. and survived in a contracted state until perhaps the early 13th century A.D.  Religion  The Orontid dynasty in Sophene practiced Zoroastrianism. According to modern historian Michał Marciak, the well-attested existence of Iranian culture in Sophene could be understood as a derivation of Arsacid Armenia, which came from Greater Armenia and indirectly from Iran. However, he also adds that the strong existence of Iranian culture might have influenced Roman and Greek writers to regard the region as Armenian. The Orontids were involved or revived certain local practices of their Persian satrapal descendants to make their small realm stand out. Furthermore, with the names of the royal members of the family including the names of their newfound cities, the Orontids emphasized their Achaemenid and Orontid royal dynastic aspirations, and also their Iranian cultural background. Iranian cults were popular in Sophene amongst the nobility, who gave themselves theophoric Iranian names, and the peasantry, who sacrificed horses in the name of the goddess Anahita. Anahita was highly popular in the country, with animals such as cows and horses being regularly sacrificed in her name.  Language  Armenian was the common language that spoken by the people of Sophene. However, Imperial Aramaic (with a fairly strong admixture of Persian terms), was used in governmental and court proceedings, which was rooted in Achaemenid practices from Armenia.

As well as the erotic themes, they are also defined by mixing more typical traditional animation with sequences of UPA and Yōji Kuri–influenced experimental use of modern design, limited animation, and still paintings akin to Tezuka's experimental short films and like those largely were all directed, sometimes sharing the billing with Tezuka, by Eiichi Yamamoto. The first, A Thousand & One Nights, at 130 minutes, remains one of the longest ever animated films. The first two are also notable for having scores by famed composer and electronic rearranger Isao Tomita. The third, Belladonna, made without Tezuka's direct involvement, is more serious than its predecessors and more avant-garde still, telling its story largely through pans over still, panoramic paintings with narration. The three films in the trilogy are: * (1969) * (1970) * (1973) All three were released onto DVD-Video by the video division of Columbia Music Entertainment, both separately and as a box set, in 2004 in Japan and re-released in 2006. A 1991 original video animation based on part of Ihara Saikaku's The Life of an Amorous Man (released on VHS in the United Kingdom and Ireland as The Sensualist) made at Grouper Production is sometimes considered an unofficial successor to the trilogy, owing to the involvement of Yamamoto as screenwriter and its similar experimental imagery.

He is particularly versed in the Russian language and culture. He is also an authority on the 'career' of Protocols of Zion in the former Russian Empire. Prof. Baran received his B.S. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967. He received his M.A. in Slavic languages and Literature from Harvard University in 1969, and his Ph.D. in 1976. Of particular interest to historians of the notorious Protocols of Zion is Prof. Baranэs presentation of his research on two individuals, Sergei Svatikov (1880–1942), and Alexandre du Chayla (1885–1945). The former was a historian, and a political figure. The latter was a French nobleman who converted to Russian Orthodoxy. Both played significant roles, on the side of the prosecution against the Protocols, at the Berne Trial of 1935. Until this presentation, not much was known about these individuals apart from their public participation at said trial. Prof. Baran made his presentation (in a paper) based on Western and Russian archival repositories. His paper presents new light on the relationship among Svatikov, Du Chayla, and on other individuals who either presented evidence or testified at the Berne Trial. Other individuals considered include Elias Tscherikower, a historian, and Vladimir Burtsev, a journalist and a political figure. Academic focus Russian Silver Age literature, Russian avant-garde; poetics; history of Slavic philology within a broad intellectual and political context; history of the forgery \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" Life Three-time Fulbright Award winner, Henryk Baran of the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures has taught more than 60 courses in his long and distinguished career, and was recognized for his research contributions last July with an honorary doctorate from the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow. Baran received his graduate training in the Slavic Department of Harvard University, where he studied with Roman Jakobson, one of the leading scholars of language, literature and linguistics in the 20th century and an expert on Russian poetry. Baran's dissertation was a study of Russian futurist poet Velmir Khlebnikov. Even before completing his dissertation, he published two papers on Khlebnikov, one in a festschrift for Taranovsky and the other in the literary journal Russian Literature. Baran's research has been included in 70 articles and book chapters, as well as four edited books. A founding editor of Elementa: Journal of Slavic Studies and Comparative Cultural Semiotics, Baran was also associate editor of the Slavic and East European Journal. His administrative experience at UAlbany includes seven years as department chair and service as graduate adviser and coordinator for the Slavic studies program. Baran has also been invited to speak at some of the most prestigious departments and programs both here and abroad, including those at Harvard, Princeton, NYU, Ohio State University, Oberlin College, Institute of Russian Language (Moscow), Institute of World Literature (Moscow), Helsinki University and Russian State University of the Humanities (Moscow).

World War II  Elkhorn sailed from New Orleans, Louisiana, 25 February 1944 for the South Pacific Ocean, and arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea, 29 May for duty as station tanker. She made several voyages to Manus to reload and fueled ships in the invasion of Morotai in September 1944, otherwise serving at Milne Bay until March 1945 when she arrived at Leyte. Elkhorn served throughout the Philippines until 1 December, then returned to the U.S.West Coast for overhaul.  Korean War  Elkhorn remained on active service with the US Pacific Fleet through 1962. From her base at Pearl Harbor she alternated tours of duty in the Far East with cruises among the islands of the South and central Pacific. During the Korean war she operated in Japanese waters and off the Korean coast twice, in 1951 and 1953, and in 1956 and 1957 she sailed from the west coast to Icy Cape and Point Barrow as a part of the Arctic resupply missions.

The ensemble was established in 1954 by Cliff Adams (21 August 1923 – 22 October 2001). Career Cliff Adams was born on 21 August 1923 in Southwark, London, England. He became a chorister at St Mary le Bow, Cheapside, studied piano and organ, and by his mid-teens started a professional musical career as a big band pianist. He was drafted into the Royal Air Force in the Second World War, and became part of the RAF band, performing mostly in Africa. After the war he joined the Leslie Douglas band, and began working on arrangements for other bandleaders including Bert Ambrose, Ted Heath and Cyril Stapleton. In 1949, he formed a vocal group, The Stargazers, with Fred Datchler, Dick James (later replaced by Bob Brown), Ronnie Milne and Marie Benson. The group found success backing leading singers of the day. Adams also worked in the new medium of television advertising, writing many jingles, such as for Murray Mints, Fry's Turkish Delight, Milk Tray and Smash instant mashed potato. In 1954, Adams formed a new group, the Show Band Singers, for live appearances, but the group was renamed the Cliff Adams Singers when it moved into broadcasting. On 3 July 1959 the singers first appeared on the BBC Light Programme in Sing Something Simple, also featuring Jack Emblow on piano and accordion. Featuring Adams's own arrangements of popular songs, the show was originally commissioned for six programmes, but was so successful that it was immediately extended, and continued to be broadcast every Sunday until shortly after Adams' death in 2001. According to one obituary of Adams, the Singers had a \\"smooth, melodic and unruffled sound [that] fitted a still nostalgic British post-war musical atmosphere.\\" The Cliff Adams Singers frequently sang medleys. Sometimes the songs were grouped thematically, other times they did medleys of songs by certain artists – Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, for example. They also sang traditional songs like \\"Old McDonald Had a Farm\\", \\"One Man Went To Mow\\", and the Swiss folk song, \\"Upidee\\". They had a Top 40 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1960 with the \\"Lonely Man Theme\\". The piece was an instrumental release and was credited to the Cliff Adams Orchestra. The tune was used in a TV commercial for Strand cigarettes in the UK. Several albums featuring the singers were released, usually entitled Sing Something Simple. Their albums reached number 15 in the UK Albums Chart in 1960 and 1962, number 23 in 1976 and number 39 in 1982. These releases included a special album featuring songs from the musicals. There was also a release called Sing Something Silver, to mark the 25th year of Sing Something Simple, and a \\"Very Best Of\\" compilation album, which featured 56 songs, not including the theme tune, which traditionally opened and closed the radio show, and most other compilations. The actress and entertainer Anita Harris was, at various times, a singer with the group. The Cliff Adams Singers were also recruited by Duke Ellington to perform with him in Coventry Cathedral in 1964, and Adams provided the score for the 1976 West End musical, Liza of Lambeth.

Life and career  Born 7 September 1881 in Akn, historical Armenia - present-day Kemaliye, Turkey - to a shoemaker's family, Nicol Galanderian lost most of his family in the Turkish massacres of 1894-96. Galanderian, his mother Eva and a brother survived and settled in Eastern Armenia. In 1900 Galanderian began studies under the noted Armenian composer Komitas Vardapet at the Gevorgian Seminary. He studied with Komitas for two years, becoming familiar with Armenian church music and the Armenian notational system. Afterwards, Galanderian studied the violin and guitar on his own and continued to explore music theory. In 1910, he accepted a teaching position in Tiflis, Georgia, and in 1911 began his composing career with his first composition based on a text of Avetik Isahakyan Yerger ou verker (\\"Songs and Wounds\\"). With the recognition of his work came an invitation to teach at the Haykazian School (now Davtian School) in Tehran, Iran, where he lived and composed the rest of this life. In Tehran, he organized and conducted the \\"Goghtan\\" choir, an Armenian choir that performed many of his works. In 1913 he wrote a children's opera and, beginning in 1924, many other compositions for children. Many of his works draw upon Armenian poetry and writings. His works draw upon the poetry of Vahan Terian, Hovhannes Toumanian, Avetik Isahakyan and others. His work includes the operas Parvana (a lake in Georgia), Hovik (\\"Breeze\\") and Lalvari vors (\\"Lalvar's Prey\\"). His compositions and manuscripts are in the archives of the State Museum of Art and Literature in Yerevan, Armenia. Galanderian continued his career until his death on 2 March 1944, in Tehran.

Name The name of the genus giving the family its name is a combination of Ancient Greek troglos \\"cave\\", and the harvestman genus Siro, a reference to the habitat of the type specimen. Despite this, the genus does not appear to be adapted for a troglobitic lifestyle, and subsequent specimens have been collected from Berlesate (soil samples run through a Berlese Funnel). Description Troglosironidae are 1.7 to 2.5 mm long and eyeless. They have mostly smooth, robust chelicerae, with or without a dorsal crest on the basal segment. They have laterally projecting ozophores, tarsal claws on the second pair of legs with a row of teeth, no opisthosomal median furrow, and a lamelliform adenostyle. The coxae 2 are not fused to the coxae 3, but sternites 8 and 9, and tergite 9, are all fused together, forming a complete corona analis. Exocrine gland pores are located on the sternum. These gland pores form unique depressions in most species, except for those found on the northern half of the island. The spermatopositor of the males also exhibit a unique setation pattern, as well as enlarged moveable fingers with toothed margins. Distribution Troglosironidae is found exclusively on the island of New Caledonia, although the possibility exists that they could inhabit nearby islands as well. They can be found in leaf litter across the island, in both low and high elevations. The family is believed to be an ancient relict of a once-widespread group that managed to survive on the island, as opposed to a more recent group that dispersed across the ocean, as the dispersal ability of Cyphophthalmi in general is regarded as poor. Species in the north of the island and the south of the island form 2 distinct lineages, indicated by morphological differences in the sternum of species collected from the 2 different regions. Relationships Troglosironidae was erected as a family in 1993, upon the discovery of 5 additional species of the formerly monospecific Troglosiro. The family was originally placed alongside Petallidae and Sironidae in the infraorder Temperophthalmi, but later analyses recovered Troglosironidae in a close relationship with Neogoveidae and Ogoveidae, and was moved to the newly erected infraorder Sternophthalmi as the sister family to the superfamily Ogoveoidea, which contains the 2 latter families. A cladistic analysis was conducted for the internal relationships of the family in 2009, the results of which are reproduced here. The species Troglosiro platnicki and T. tillierorum (marked with *) were not used in the study, and their position in the phylogeny is speculative, though probable based on morphological similarities. However, it has been suggested that T. platnicki may be synonymous with T. juberthiei. This study also recovered the divergence between the two lineages of Sternophthalmi (Ogoveoidea and Troglosironidae) to have occurred approximately 221 million years ago, and the family Troglosironidae to have emerged approximately 49 million years ago. Another study recovered older ages, with the divergence of the Sternophthalmi lineages to have occurred approximately 279 million years ago, with the emergence of Troglosironidae to have occurred approximately 57 million years ago. This family is thought to be the youngest Cyphophthalmi family by a wide margin, although no data exists regarding the age of Ogoveidae.

Though formally divided into 13 tracks, the entire album consists of a single continuous piece of music, with some musical themes which are repeated throughout the work. Because of its narrative nature, it has been called a rock opera and/or dense concept album. The story follows an astronaut who, while on a voyage to Saturn, encounters aliens who take him to their galaxy, where he is suffused with knowledge and wisdom. It is usually interpreted as a commentary on the nuclear arms race. Reception Allmusic's retrospective review was a rave, avowing that \\"Throughout Journey's 13 cuts, Nektar introduced their own sort of instrumental surrealism that radiated from both the vocals and from the intermingling of the haphazard drum and string work.\\" They gave unqualified praise to both the compositions and the performances of each of the individual members.

Originally a jobbing printer and newspaper publisher, founded in 1890, it took the name Odhams Press Ltd in 1920 when it merged with John Bull magazine. By 1937 it had founded the first colour weekly, Woman, for which it set up and operated a dedicated high-speed print works. The company also owned Ideal Home (founded 1920) and acquired the equestrian magazine Horse and Hound. Later, Odhams expanded into book publishing, for example publishing Winston Churchill's Painting as a Pastime, Rupert Gunnis's Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660–1851, and an edition of the complete works of William Shakespeare. Throughout the 1960s, Odhams Books Ltd (likewise founded by Odhams Press) operated the Companion Book Club (CBC). This published a large series of hard cover novels. History Odhams' proprietorship According to Susan M. Penn's history of Long Street at Sherborne, Dorset, as verified by Harrop's historical house survey and by local census information, the house known since 1968 as Mistletoe Cottage was occupied in 1834 by John Odhams. His eldest son, William, grew up to be a compositor: possibly serving his apprenticeship with Langdon and Harker at the Sherborne Mercury Printing Office in Long Street, according to his great granddaughter, although there is no other evidence to support this. However, at the rear of Mistletoe Cottage is a substantial brick-built shed. The flat flooring of this shed is very solid, completed with thick oak planking, well able to support and withstand heavy items of machinery such as a printing press. Earthworks next to the shed in or around 2002 revealed evidence of many coloured printing inks still visible in the soil. In 1834 William Odhams left for London, where he initially worked for The Morning Post. In 1847 he went into partnership with William Biggar in Beaufort Buildings, Savoy, London; and in the 1870s he started the business known as William Odhams. He sold the business to his two sons, John Lynch Odhams and William James Baird Odhams, in 1892. Odhams Limited, created in 1898, in turn became Odhams Press by 1920.Odhams Press Limited, a limited liability company registered in England and Wales, was incorporated on 17 April 1914, and survived until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today as a dormant private company. In 1954, Odhams Press Hall was built in Watford, designed by Yates, Cook and Derbyshire, and this was later protected by the local council because of the innovative clock tower, which houses a water tank for use in printing. Takeovers In 1960 Cecil Harmsworth King, chairman of the Daily Mirror newspaper, made an approach to Odhams on behalf of Fleetway Publications Ltd (formerly the Amalgamated Press). Odhams' board found this too attractive to refuse and, in 1961, Odhams was taken over by Fleetway. In 1963 its holdings were amalgamated with those of the George Newnes Ltd, Fleetway, and others, to form the International Publishing Corporation (known as IPC). Between 1964 and 1968 Odhams operated as a subsidiary of IPC, diversifying into boys' comics. During the period 1967–1968, it published an imprint known as the Power Comics, particularly notable for its use of superhero material reprinted from American Marvel Comics, which included the titles Wham!, Pow!, and Smash!. Close of business In 1968 Odhams encountered financial problems, partly due to unfavourable economic conditions in Britain. As a result of this, and of IPC's desire to rationalise its titles and eliminate duplication, the comics published by the Odhams Press imprint were closed or transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, another IPC subsidiary. This contained the losses on the Power Comics range within Odhams, which was a limited company with separate liability, but, in consequence, Odhams became financially unviable. On 1 January 1969 it effectively ceased to exist as a publishing business, when publication of its last surviving comics title, Smash!, was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd.

By marriage she was Duchess of Guise from 1570 to 1588, and Dowager Duchess of Guise thereafter. She was Countess of Eu in her own right from 1564. Biography Catherine was the second daughter of François de Clèves, Duke of Nevers, and Marguerite de Bourbon, elder sister of Antoine de Bourbon. She was the first cousin of Henry of Navarre, sister-in- law of Henri de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, and great aunt of Ludwika Maria Gonzaga, Queen of Poland. At the age of twelve, Catherine married Antoine de Croÿ, Prince de Porcien (or Porcean), who died seven years later. After the conventional three years of mourning, on 4 October 1570, she married Henri de Lorraine, Duke of Guise, who was two years her junior. They had fourteen children, including Charles, Duke of Guise and Louis III, Cardinal of Guise. She had a widely publicised affair with a young nobleman, Saint-Mégrin, who was killed by her husband. The event is dramatised in the Alexandre Dumas play Henri III et sa cour (1829). Henry of Guise was the leader of the fervently Catholic faction in the French Wars of Religion. From 1584, the conflict among factions led by Henry of Guise, Henry of Navarre, and Henry III of France was known as the War of the Three Henrys. In 1588, Henry of Guise was assassinated on the orders of King Henry III. Catherine never forgave Henry III of France (who kept taunting her as \\"la maîtresse de Saint Megrin\\") for his part in the assassination of her husband. She took a keen interest in the intrigues of the Catholic League and encouraged Henry's assassination in 1589. At the conclusion of the War of the Three Henrys she was mindful of the interests of her large family and supported her son Charles as a candidate for the French throne. Catherine's reconciliation with her cousin, Henry IV, was not effected until his conversion to Catholicism. She immediately moved to Paris and obtained a very honorable position in the retinue of his wife, Marie de' Medici. In 1613, Catherine interceded for her son, François Alexandre, who had killed the Baron of Luz in a duel, asking for his banishment instead of execution for murder. The Guises continued to support the Queen throughout the regency, and Catherine followed Marie into exile in Blois after Louis XIII assumed the reins of government in 1619. After returning to the Louvre, the Dowager Duchess - anxious to promote the interests of the House of Guise - resumed plotting against Cardinal Richelieu. The death of her youngest daughter, the princesse de Conti (who had been implicated in the Day of the Dupes conspiracy), proved a blow to her spirits. She retired to her château d'Eu, where she died aged 85. She was buried at the château next to her husband's ornate tomb.  Issue  She married on October 4, 1570 in Paris to Henri de Lorraine, Duke of Guise, by whom she had fourteen children: # Charles, Duke of Guise (1571–1640), # Henri (June 30, 1572, Paris – August 13, 1574) # Catherine (November 3, 1573) (died at birth) # Louis III, Cardinal of Guise (1575–1621), Archbishop of Reims # Charles (January 1, 1576, Paris) (died at birth) # Marie (June 1, 1577–1582) # Claude, Duke of Chevreuse (1578–1657) married Marie de Rohan, daughter of Hercule de Rohan, duc de Montbazon # Catherine (b.

It carries State Road 865 (San Carlos Boulevard) between the Florida mainland (via San Carlos Island) and Estero Island, which is a major tourist destination. The bridge is one of the island's two connections to the mainland. The other is the Bonita Beach Causeway on the south end of the island. The current Matanzas Pass Bridge opened in 1979, and is tall. It was the tallest bridge in Lee County when it was built, but it was surpassed in 2007 by the first bridge of the Sanibel Causeway, which is tall. The current bridge has two traffic lanes, one for northbound traffic and one for southbound traffic. There is also a pedestrian lane, which is separated from the rest of the bridge by a concrete barrier. Fishing piers also exist underneath the bridge on each side. The bridge's current blue color was added in 2011, making it resemble the Jewfish Creek Bridge in Key Largo. History 1921-1926 Wooden bridge The original Matanzas Pass Bridge was a small wooden drawbridge built in 1921. The roadway connecting to the bridge originally ran from the bridge along the coast to present-day Bunche Beach where it connected to John Morris Road, which goes on to McGregor Boulevard. The original wooden bridge had a 54-cent toll. At this point, San Carlos Island was part of the mainland. A major hurricane in 1926 destroyed the original bridge, only five years after it was built. This same hurricane also separated what is now San Carlos Island from the mainland, making the road impassible. The body of water created by the hurricane separating San Carlos Island from the mainland was appropriately named Hurricane Pass. Swing bridge built in 1927 In 1927, a concrete swing bridge was installed to replace the original. San Carlos Boulevard was also constructed at this time as a more direct route to replace the original road. The swing bridge was a recycled bridge that formerly operated on the east coast of Florida. An electric motor was installed on the bridge in 1950 due to the area's rapidly growing shrimping industry, which caused the span to be opened frequently. Despite being motorized, the bridge was old and unreliable, and island residents feared that the bridge would fail and strand them in the event of an emergency, such as a hurricane evacuation. This concern led to the construction of Bonita Beach Causeway at the southern end of the island in 1965. The swing bridge was replaced by the current bridge in 1979. The current bridge is a 65 foot tall fixed span to accommodate the area's large shrimping vessels without disrupting traffic. The current bridge was built one block east of the swing bridge to accommodate its height, and the old bridge's approach is now known as Old San Carlos Boulevard on the island side.

It is set in a fantasy world with different laws, kingdoms, gods and magic. It was serialized in Monthly Comic Zero Sum, a josei manga magazine published monthly by Ichijinsha. Seventeen bound volumes have been released by the publisher. The manga was originally licensed by Go! Comi for release in North America, but they stopped publishing in October 2009 and Viz Media has since picked up the license for the series. The series has been adapted into a drama CD and an anime television series from Studio Deen, which debuted in April 2009. 07-Ghost won a double-first prize in the third Zero-Sum Comics Grand-Prix, meaning it was chosen for first place by both readers and editors. Plot Teito Klein is a former slave who now attends the Barsburg Empire's military academy due to his ability to use Zaiphon, a type of supernatural power. The ability is rare and thus highly prized. Teito is an amnesiac who frequently has frightening dreams. The night before the graduation exam, Teito and his only friend, Mikage, vow they will never abandon each other. The next day, Teito overhears people talking about him. Stopping to listen, he suddenly realizes that the speaker, Chief of Staff Ayanami, is the person who killed the familiar man in his dreams: his father, the king of the destroyed Raggs Kingdom. Teito is caught eavesdropping and tries to attack Ayanami but is quickly brought down by one of his subordinates and sent to prison. Mikage comes to help him escape, only to find that Teito has managed to fight past the guards by himself. The two flee the building but are cornered on a balcony. Teito pretends to hold Mikage hostage, then makes his escape, though he is wounded by a Zaiphon blast that Ayanami directs at him. Three bishops in the nearby 7th District discover the injured Teito and take him to a nearby church to recuperate, where he is protected because of the 7th District's law of sanctuary. In due time, it is discovered that Teito carries the Eye of Mikhail, a powerful talisman for which his home country was destroyed. This fact, as well as a fateful reunion, catapults Teito into a quest for revenge against the Barsburg Empire and for knowledge about his past. At the same time, his status as the bearer of the Eye of Mikhail throws him into the long- standing conflict between the evil Verloren and his enemies, the 07 Ghosts. Setting The book is set in the midst of the Barsburg Empire, which is divided into seven districts, each with its own cities, rulers, and culture. Zaiphon Zaiphon is the \\"magic\\" of 07-Ghosts's world, the ability to convert life energy into various forms of power (it is Zaiphon that keeps the continent floating). It is controlled by converting strong emotions into energy, and the power that comes from Zaiphon often takes the shape of words, though people may use weapons to channel said energy. Those who have the ability to use Zaiphon are rare and thought to be blessed by God. Every user's capabilities are different, and in many cases, reflect their nature. Zaiphon is generally categorized into three types: * Healing Zaiphon: People with healing Zaiphon are able to heal wounds and share or transfer their Zaiphon to others. Characters who primarily use healing Zaiphon are Labrador, Assistant Archbishop Bastien, Ouka, and Capella. * Offensive Zaiphon: People with offensive Zaiphon can attack enemies and protect themselves from attacks directed at them. Characters who primarily use offensive Zaiphon are Teito, Mikage, Ayanami, Hakuren, Frau, and Capella. * Manipulation Zaiphon: People with manipulation Zaiphon (which is particularly rare) can move other objects at will. Castor uses this type of Zaiphon. It is possible to learn to use more than one version of Zaiphon; however, people who can successfully do so are few and far between. There are a variety of weapons used to manipulate Zaiphon, one of these being the bascule. With the bascule, people can channel their Zaiphon and use it for several purposes. Different types of Zaiphon have different effects when used through a bascule: those with healing Zaiphon cannot directly attack a Kor, but they can restrict and remove Kor from afflicted people, and those with offensive Zaiphon can directly attack a Kor. 07-Ghosts and Verloren According to a centuries-old myth, the God of Death, Verloren (Dutch or German for Lost), 'killed' the daughter of the Chief of Heaven and was forced to escape to the earth. In retribution, Verloren invaded the hearts of the people, who slipped into despair. Lamenting over the people's suffering, the Chief of Heaven dispatched seven heavenly lights in order to punish Verloren. Called the \\"Seven Ghosts\\", they are said to have sealed Verloren on the earth and served forevermore as the guardians of the Empire. Mothers often tell their children that if they are naughty, the Seven Ghosts will come to take them away. Though Verloren has been sealed away in Pandora's Box for over 1000 years, his messengers, the Kor, find and contact humans to bring them under his influence. If a contract is made, a mark appears on the person's chest. This is known as \\"Verloren's curse,\\" and it indicates one's heart being eaten by darkness. One of the duties of the \\"07-Ghosts\\" is to fight against Verloren and his curse and try to stop contracts from being fulfilled. Only the Bishops can remove Verloren's curse. The 07-Ghosts are embodied in humans with such extraordinary Zaiphon abilities that they are considered to be blessed by God. They were originally fragments of Verloren, and they were sent down to the earth by the Chief of Heaven in order to stop Verloren. Each of the 07-Ghosts has died in his previous life, and they all retain their memories of their past lives. Frau, Castor, Labrador, Fea Kreuz and Lance have been revealed to be Ghosts thus far; all of them have the mark of their Ghosts on their hands. The Ghosts' names are Zehel, Fest, Prophet, Landkarte, Reliquie (or Relikt), Eher and Vertrag, all of which have Dutch or German origins. Each of the Ghosts has a specific power: Zehel – 斬魂 \\"the cutting spirit\\" (Frau; the Ghost who severs bonds) Fest – 繋魂 \\"The Tying Spirit\\" (Castor; the Ghost who binds souls together) Profe – 言魂 \\"The Speaking Spirit\\" (Labrador; the Ghost who prophesies) Reliquie (can be also written as \\"Relikt\\") – 遺魂 \\"The Bequeathing Spirit\\" (Lance; the Ghost who sees one's past) Vertrag – 契魂 \\"The Pledging Spirit\\" (Fea Kreuz; the Ghost who manipulates souls) Landkarte – 消魂 \\"The Extinguishing Spirit\\" (Katsuragi; the Ghost who sent something or himself away to a certain place) Ea – 醒魂 \\"The Awaking Spirit\\" (Kal; the Ghost who assigns numbers to every soul in the world and determines their destination after death) Some editions may translate the Ghosts name wrong. Since all their names come from German, the names have a meaning in this language, and are not just a name. For example, It is common to see the name \\"Randkalt\\". \\"Rand\\" means \\"edge\\", \\"kalt\\" means \\"cold\\", making the name meaningless. In the other hand, the name \\"Landkarte\\" means \\"map\\", which corresponds with Landkarte's ability. The same happens with the Ghosts Reliquie (translated Rilect, not a German word) and Eher (Ea, not a German word). The Three Wishes When a person is given a life from the Chief of the Heavens, they choose three dreams to complete over the course of their lifetime. When all the dreams are granted, their souls will be called back to the Chief and be reincarnated. However, when people are born they do not remember the dreams they chose, and finding out the dreams is supposedly the joy of life. There are evil beings who want to interfere with this process; among them are Verloren's messengers, the Kor, who steal dreams and drag humans into darkness. When a human's first dream is granted by a Kor, the person's heart becomes unstable and unable to be satisfied no matter what he or she does. When the second dream is granted, the person falls into a state of starvation or addiction. When the third dream is granted, the soul has indulged in too much darkness and becomes forever unable to return to the Chief of Heaven. The Kor then takes the body; a possessed body with all three dreams fulfilled by the Kor is called a Wars ( means \\"evil\\" in Japanese), and they serve Verloren. A dark magician who can control the Wars is called a Warsfeil. It is the duty of the church to protect people from the Kor, because the feeling of addiction is very difficult to remove. There are cases when a Kor may grant a wish that is not one of the three dreams, but it upsets the equilibrium and the Kor may be punished for it. The Eyes of Mikhail and Raphael The Eyes of Mikhail and Raphael are a set of holy stones that can be embedded into the body, allowing the Archangels Mikhail and Raphael to descend into a host's body for a limited time. They are undetectable until they possess their host's body, whereupon the stone appears in the host's hand, the host's eye color changes, and they become able to wield godlike powers with Zaiphon. Before the storyline of \\"07-Ghost,\\" the royal family of the Kingdom of Raggs held the Eye of Mikhail and the Barsburg Empire held the Eye of Raphael. A pact was established between both countries never to seize the other Eye; however, the Barsburg Empire broke this pact ten years prior to the storyline. The Eyes' full usages are unknown; however, thus far, the Eye of Mikhail has been used to seal Verloren's original body in Pandora's Box, and the Eye of Raphael has been said to be able to reincarnate Verloren's soul in human bodies.Manga volume 3, page 38; anime episode 15. chibi form Style The overall style for 07-Ghost fits into the fantasy manga genre. Although the plot is serious, there is a lot of comic relief, giving the story a more lighthearted tone. The characters are all complex, varied and entertaining, and the story is extremely emotional. It is often disputed as to whether it is a shōnen or shōjo manga, since it has qualities that appeal to both demographics. Characters Main characters From left to right: Mikage, Hakuren, Mikage's reincarnated self (Burupya), and Teito ; : :The protagonist of the story. His real name is revealed to be Wahrheit (German for truth) Tiashe Raggs, son of Weldeschtein Krom Raggs, and he is the prince of the former Raggs Kingdom. However, after being entrusted with the Eye of Mikhail during the invasion by the Barsburg Empire, his identity was hidden and he was raised by his uncle, Fea Kreuz, as a church orphan. Upon the death of Kreuz, he was made into a combat slave (Sklave in german), but eventually entered the Barsburg military academy and became known as a star pupil. He is a clever student and very talented, making him one of the best students despite other students' mockery. :At the beginning of the story, Teito is a cold and serious student due to his only memories being those of a combat slave whose only purpose was to kill criminals. He is initially cold to Mikage as well, although the two eventually become good friends. Strangely, according to the academy chairman, Miroku, Teito's greatest weakness is his compassion, despite all the hardships he has gone through. :Teito is very skilled with the Bascules, even exceeding the Zaiphon limit twice for it during training.07-Ghost chapter 10, page 32. He is very agile and an excellent runner after having trained with Castor's puppets, and manages to get through the examinations on his first try with Hakuren and he became Frau's apprentice. His slave number was 2741. :It is hinted by Mikhail that Teito is the best vessel he has ever had. Teito receives extra abilities as the master of the Eye of Mikhail, such as advanced hearing and a sixth sense. More are said to be sleeping within him. He was made the master of the eye of Mikhail due to the pope inserting Verloren into his body. The Eye was used to seal Verloren's body and protect Teito's soul, making him the Pandora's Box. :Teito ranked first in the latest popularity poll in Monthly Comic Zero Sum. ; : :A perverted Bishop who hides porn in the library (even though it is not allowed for priests to read porn), he saves Teito's life when Teito falls from his . He is the member of the 07-Ghosts known as 'Zehel'.Yuki Amemiya & Yukino Ichihara. 07-Ghost, Volume 2. Tokyo, Japan: Ichijinsha, chapter 7, 04. He finds Mikage (as a small dragon) for Teito and accidentally becomes Teito's 'Master' when he attempts to remove Teito's promise collar, thereby invoking a blood contract. This collar gives Frau the ability to use three commands on Teito: bind, sleep and pain. For all his teasing, Frau also keeps Teito's spirits up with impromptu pep-talks. His relation with Ayanami is not yet known. Frau is the only Ghost who can wield Verloren's scythe, though how he managed to get this scythe is currently unknown. His catch phrase before every battle is \\"May God be with you\\". Frau was ranked second in the latest popularity poll in Monthly Comic Zero Sum. ; : :Another bishop, he convinces Teito to take the examination to enter the priesthood. The training he puts Teito through is vigorous and often involves his 'dolls', life-sized puppets he controls with Zaiphon. He is one of the 07-Ghosts, 'Fest'. He was the heir of the Hausen House (which symbolize Fest), Xinglu Hausen, who \\"passed away\\" ten ago. He was voted fifth in the latest popularity poll in Monthly Comic Zero Sum. ; : :A bishop whose hobby is gardening and brewing herbs to make medicine. He was first introduced when Frau found Teito and brought him back to the church. He gives Teito a flower of protection at the start of the manga which later saves his life during an encounter with a Kor. He also gives Teito a drink made from sweet flowers to heal his 'wounds of the heart'. During battles, he is able to use flowers and vines as weapons with his manipulation Zaiphon. He is also able to communicate with flowers. It has been confirmed by an omake, and later in chapter 46 of the manga, that he is indeed a Ghost, known as 'Profe'. His powers as a Ghost grant him the gift of foresight, which allowed him to aid Teito before Teito's first encounter with a Kor. He does not wish to kill Veloren, only for him to live in the world as a proper human. ; : :Teito's roommate at the church and, at first, his self-proclaimed rival for the priesthood exam. They first meet soon after Mikage's death when Hakuren walks by Teito in the church. Teito mistakes him for Mikage since they look somewhat similar, but upon looking closer, realizes it is someone else. Teito then realizes that he is Shuri Oak's brother. Upon seeing that Teito is training to become a bishop a well, he states that Teito is now his rival. Teito thinks there is something about Hakuren that is familiar to him until Hakuren asks Teito whether middle school children were starting to take the exam as well. Teito suddenly realizes that Hakuren sounds a lot like Shuri Oak, his tormentor from the military academy. Eventually, they apologize for being so rude to each other and become friends. After passing the bishop exam, he became Castor's apprentice. Hakuren was ranked fifth in the latest popularity poll in Monthly Comic Zero Sum. ; : :The main antagonist, he is the man who killed Teito's Father in the war against Raggs and seeks the Eye of Mikhail. Later in the manga, a picture of the Raggs royal family is shown, revealing that Ayanami is Teito's uncle. Because of his birth, some colleagues dislike him and constantly give him a hard time.07-Ghost volume 3 page 87 (chapter 14), chapter 21, chapter 28, Anime episode 4, episode 7 On the surface he is respected, as he is greeted by salutes by officers whose ranks are lower than his, but some officers talk about Ayanami disrespectfully behind his back as well.What they speak about differs with translation. In the official Chinese translation of manga chapter 4, they say that \\"he (Ayanami) is merely a descendant of an exiled, noble family\\" ; whereas in an English translation, they say \\"he is merely a descendant of the lowest class of aristocrats who were discarded by the royal family\\". It is unknown which version correctly translates the original Japanese version. In one chapter in the manga, when the Barsburg officers hear that Ayanami is leading 500 soldiers to Antwort to reinforce them, they say that the Black Hawks (Ayanami and his personal subordinates) are monsters and they do not want to fight with them. He is also the reincarnated Verloren. ; : :Teito's best friend, Mikage comes from a family of stewards. Despite the fact that his closeness with Teito makes him a target of some students' ill will in the academy, he remains a bright and cheerful person. His relationship with Teito involves a lot of Mikage teasing Teito, Teito beating him up in return, and his urging Teito to eat more. The two are very close, promising each other that they will die together and will always be \\"the best of friends\\". Mikage also teaches Teito about meeting friends and having compassion. After learning of Castor's family's grief for their son, he tells Seilan, \\"Mikage had told me... that if two people were together, sadness would also be halved...\\"07-Ghost chapter 32, page 9. :Mikage is killed, but later reincarnated as a small, furry, pink dragon. Frau explains that it's because he wished to protect Teito, no matter the form. Mikage is easily recognizable by the small X shaped scar on his chin; he got it a long time ago when he was sparring with his older brother.Yuki Amemiya & Yukino Ichihara. 07-Ghost, chapter 1, page 9. Burupya has a similar scar on his head. He ranked third in the latest popularity poll in Monthly Comic Zero Sum. ;Ouida : :He helped Teito in the Bishop Exam by giving him some of his Zaiphon. He has a younger brother named Liam. Media Manga 07-Ghost was serialized in the shōjo manga magazine Monthly Comic Zero Sum published by Ichijinsha. 17 volumes have been released.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Chuck Jones and Abe Levitow. The short was released on January 10, 1959, and stars Bugs Bunny. It shows Bugs conducting an orchestra - with a fly bothering him. Bugs conducts, and in part, plays the overture to \\"Ein Morgen, ein Mittag und Abend in Wien\\" (A Morning, Noon, and Night in Vienna)\\", a composition by Franz von Suppé. Though Mel Blanc was credited for vocal characterizations, there is no dialogue in the short; the only vocal effect made was when an audience member is heard coughing. This is the third and last Bugs Bunny cartoon (the first two being A Corny Concerto and Rhapsody Rabbit, although he says three lines in the latter) where Bugs is silent. Or, nearly silent; at one point, he 'shushes' the brass. This is also one of the last cartoons to get a Merrie Melodies Blue Ribbon reissue in 1968. Plot Bugs is about to conduct \\"The Warner Bros. Symphony Orchestra\\" (supposedly in concert at the Hollywood Bowl). As he begins his elaborate preparation, someone in the audience starts coughing loudly. Bugs holds up a sign reading, \\"Throw the bum out!\\", which the audience does. Other problems plague Bugs' conducting, notably a bothersome fly and awkward cuffs that keep falling off; with each of these issues, his reactions act as direction to the orchestra, which responds accordingly, angering Bugs. In the middle of the performance, as a result of the music at that moment, Bugs plays dual roles as an indigenous person and the American troops chasing him. As his performance ends, the fly returns, landing on Bugs' nose. Bugs loses his sanity and attempts to kill the fly, crashing through the orchestra and into the instruments as he does so. As the music ends and the fly seems to be dead, Bugs bows to the crowd. Instead of applause, there is only silence and crickets chirping. Bugs looks around and sees that the seats are empty, then he becomes aware of faint clapping - coming from the fly. He bows to the fly, and the cartoon ends.

It was founded in 1945 by the National Social Welfare Assembly as that organization's youth division, but became independent in the early 1960s. In 1967, The New York Times revealed that the USYC had received more than 90 percent of its funds from the Central Intelligence Agency, leading many of the organization's largest members to quit. USYC continued to receive funding from the United States government before disbanding in 1986. Founding The USYC was founded in 1945 by the National Social Welfare Assembly, a coalition of social service agencies. Originally named the \\"Young Adult Council of the NSWA\\" (YAC), the organization had 16 members, including American Youth Hostels, Camp Fire Girls, 4-H, American Unitarian Youth, National Catholic Welfare Conference, National Students Assembly, YMCA and YWCA.Maunders, \\"Controlling Youth for Democracy: The United States Youth Council and the World Assembly of Youth\\", Commonwealth Youth and Development, 2003. YAC's structure was staff-driven. It was led by an executive director who was a full-time staff members of NSWA, and most of its funding came from the NSWA as well. International travel was often funded by outside sources, such as the Rockefeller Foundation. YAC nevertheless maintained a chairman who, under the organization's bylaws, was required to be under the age of 30. The organization also maintained council of representatives from each participating member. As late as 1967, 60 percent of WAY's budget was financed by contributions from the foundation. History In 1948, the World Assembly of Youth (WAY) was formed as a non-communist alternative to the World Federation of Democratic Youth.Altbach, \\"The International Student Movement\\", Comparative Education Review, October 1964; \\"First Group Here for Youth Session\\", The New York Times, July 26, 1951. WAY's inaugural convention was in August 1948. Prior to the meeting, the Young Adult Council ejected most of its members with ties to political parties or trade unions. The YAC played a significant role in drafting the WAY constitution and electing its first leaders, and became the U.S. affiliate of WAY. WAY struggled financially in its early years. YAC provided most of WAY's funding through a grant from the Foundation for Youth and Student Affairs, a front organization established and funded by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). YAC provided $301,000 to WAY from the foundation. Although WAY was troubled by its dependence on the Americans (and one American donor), the organization had no choice but to accept the money. YAC's executive director, Bernice Bridges, knew that the source of the funds was the U.S. government. But this fact did not appear to concern her or her superiors in NSWA. In 1963, YAC changed its name to the United States Youth Council. USYC, too, continued its reliance on CIA money. At the height of its strength in the middle to late 1960s, the U.S. Youth Council had 37 member organizations, including the College Democrats of America, Collegiate Council for the United Nations, National Federation of Catholic Youth, National Student Association, Students for a Democratic Society, YMCA, Young Christian Workers, Young Democrats of America, Young Republicans, and the Youth Division of the NAACP.Reed, \\"Youth Council to Investigate Charge of C.I.A. Link\\", The New York Times, March 6, 1967. At various times, it worked closely with the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the A. Philip Randolph Institute. In 1967, The New York Times revealed that the CIA had supplied 90 percent of the organization's funds, and was surreptitiously controlling its agenda.Sheehan, \\"Foundations Linked to C.I.A. Are Found to Subsidize 4 Other Youth Organizations\\", The New York Times, February 16, 1967. Presidents and vice-presidents of USYC were aware of the source of the funds: They were given a top-secret security clearance by the CIA and required to sign a 20-year confidentiality agreement to keep the intelligence agency's involvement a secret. The revelations caused a number of the U.S. Youth Council's largest members to withdraw.\\"Student Group Cuts Ties With U.S. Youth Council\\", The New York Times, February 22, 1967. USYC's council conducted an investigation which was largely inconclusive. The study found that some officers had clearly signed secrecy agreements, but the council was unable to prove that all presidents and vice-presidents had done so. The National Student Association and the University Christian Movement claimed the study was a whitewash, and withdrew from the USYC. In response, the USYC resolved not to accept any more funding from the Foundation for Youth and Student Affairs. The loss of government financing nearly bankrupted the USYC. In December 1967, the United States Department of State stepped in to provide funding to keep the organization afloat. In time, financing was shifted to the United States Information Agency (USIA), which continued to fund its work openly.Gailey and Weaver, \\"Switch on Youth Year\\", The New York Times, August 12, 1982. The ongoing revelations of CIA funding led USYC and NSWA to sever their relationship in 1969. USYC withdrew from WAY in 1976 after several years of tension over policies, programs, funding and anti-American feeling by delegates from under-developed countries. USYC became increasingly conservative and isolated within the American and international youth movement for the remainder of the 1970s and through the 1980s. In some respects, this enabled the organization to continue to receive funding from the Reagan administration. In 1981, the United Nations announced that 1985 would be an International Youth Year (IYY). USYC attempted to take the lead in planning for U.S. participation in the IYY. Competition with a rival body, the U.S. Committee on International Youth Year, led to a congressional investigation. In 1985, Congress passed the Zorinsky amendment (U.S.C. 1461-1a), which barred programs funded by the USIA from operating domestically or conducting propaganda campaigns against domestic audiences. The law also required the IYY committees to be representative and open to all youth organizations. USYC refused to open the executive positions on its IYY committee to other groups, and American participation in the IYY collapsed. USIA withdrew its funding for the USYC in 1986, and the organization folded. Notable leaders *Jed Johnson, Jr. - president, 1962–1964 *Ronald E.
