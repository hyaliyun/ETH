He is credited to have brought Vithoba to Pandharpur, where Vithoba's central shrine stands today. Pundalik is also perceived to be the historical founder of the Varkari sect, which is centered on the worship of Lord Vithoba. Pundalik was one of the earliest Kundalini Yoga practitioners. As He was the master of Kundalini Yoga, people used to call him \\"Kundalik\\". Later, after several years, Kundalik become Pundalik. He symbolised Kundalini energy in the form of Lord Vitthal also known as Lord Pandurang after his name Pundalik. Pandharpur's Vitthal was an incarnation of Lord Vishnu or Lord Krishna. According to legends it also depicts the symbol of the Kundalini Energy, although spiritually, the same energy dwells in all. The brick on which Lord Vitthal is standing is the basic chakra of Kundalini energy known as Muladhara Chakra. Both hands, like bows, represents Ida and Pingla nadis which cross over at the central body of Sushumna or Brahma nadi. Body represents purusha means Vishnu or Krishna and the tilaka or the mark on the head represents Ajna Chakra or guru chakra or third-eye chakra is the subtle center of energy, believed to be located between the eyebrows, located behind it along the subtle (non-physical) spinal column, as said by Lord Krishna in Bhagavad Gita. Many Kings and other noblemen were devotees of Pundalik and they built the famous Vitthal temple at Pandharpur. The age old practice of the Kundalini Yoga converted the shrine into a holy place and truth seekers from all over the world were directed here by the divine to activate and raise their Kundalini energy by the very natural process of Bhakti, the highest form of Love anyone can express. Historicity Pundalik is commonly perceived to be a historical figure, connected with the establishment and propagation of the Vithoba-centric Varkari sect.Sand (1990) p. 35 Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar considers Pundalik to be the founder of the Varkari cult and the one who promulgated the cult in Maratha country.Bhandarkar (1995) pp. 125‚Äì26 Frazer, Edwards and P.R. Bhandarkar (1922) all suggest that Pundalik tried to unify Shiva and Vishnu, and that this culture originated in Karnataka.Sand (1990) p. 37 Ranade (1933) thinks that Pundalik, a Kannada saint, was not only the founder of the Varkari culture but also the first great devotee or first high priest of the Pandharpur temple.Ranade (1933) pp. 183‚Äì84 Upadhyaya supports the priest theory but declines the Kannada origin theory. Tulpule also accepted the theory that Pundalik was the historical founder of the Varkari sect, though declines to fix a date for him due to \\"lack of authentic evidence\\". According to M. S. Mate, Pundalik was instrumental in coaxing the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana to build the Pandharpur temple to Vishnu, placing him in the early 12th century.Sand (1990) p. 38 Deleury (1960) believes Pundalik was a mystic, influenced by the Vaishnava Haridasa sect of Karnataka, who brought a drastic change in the worship of Vithoba. Pundalik not only founded the Varkari sect, but also was the first to identify Vithoba with the god Vishnu. Pundalik's fame also led to naming of Pandharpur to Paundrika-kshetra - the sacred place of Pundalik. Other scholars like Raeside (1965), Dhanpalvar (1972), and Vaudeville (1974) have questioned the historicity of Pundalik altogether, and dismissed him as a mythical figure. In his analysis of the text Panduranga mahatmya by Sridhar (discussed in \\"Legend\\" section ahead), Raeside says that the legend of devotee Pundalik could have been nothing more a derivative of Puranic legend.Raeside (1965) p. 85 Dhanpalvar strongly agreed with this possibility.Sand (1990) p. 39 Vaudeville found the legend of the Pundalik of Pandharpur was very similar to the legend of Pundarik, the devotee of Vishnu, in the Hindu epic Mahabharata.Sand (1990) p. 140 The religious historian R.C. Dhere, winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya, opines that identification of Vithoba with Vishnu led to conversion of the Shaiva (related to god Shiva) Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik. The main argument of the hypothesis is that the memorial shrine of Pundalik is a Shaiva shrine, rather than a Vaishnava one, compromising of a Shiva-linga, the symbol of god Shiva.Sand (1990) p. 40 Legends Image of a gopuram of a Pandharpur temple near Vithoba's central temple, depicting Vithoba (standing dark figure, left) waiting on the brick as Pundalik (centre) serves his parents. Texts, that narrate the legend of Pundalik and Vithoba, can be categorised into the Varkari tradition, the Brahmin tradition and what Raeside calls a \\"third tradition\\", that includes both Varkari and Brahmin elements. The Varkari texts are written in Marathi, the Brahmin texts in Sanskrit, and the \\"third tradition\\" are Marathi texts written by Brahmins. The Varkari texts are: Bhaktalilamrita and Bhaktavijaya by Mahipati, Pundalika-Mahatmya by Bahinabai, and a long abhanga by Namdev. All these texts describe the legend of Pundalik. The Brahmin texts include: two versions of Panduranga-Mahatmya from the Skanda Purana (consisting of 900 verses); Panduranga-Mahatmya from the Padma Purana (consisting of 1,200 verses); Bhima-Mahatmya, also from the Padma Purana; and a third devotional work, yet again called Panduranga-Mahatmya, which is found in the Vishnu Purana.Sand (1990) p. 56Sand (1990) p. 33For the complete English translation of Bhaktavijaya, which narrates the legend of Pundalik see Stories of Indian Saints (1988) by Mahƒ´pati, Justin Edwards Abbott, and Narhar R. Godbole. The \\"third tradition\\" is found in two works: Panduranga-Mahatmya by the Brahmin Sridhara (consisting of 750 verses), and another work of the same name written by Prahlada Maharaj (consisting of 181 verses).Sand (1990) p. 34For a complete Marathi text and English translation of Panduranga- Mahatmya by Sridhara see Raeside (1965) pp. 81-100 There are three versions of the Pundalik legend, two of which are attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34‚Äì67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god Gopala-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from Govardhana as a cowherd, accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in digambar form, wearing makara-kundala, the srivatsa mark, a head-dress of peacock feathers, resting his hands on his hips and keeping his cow-stick between his thighs. Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form on the banks of the river Chandrabhaga. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a tirtha (a holy place near a water body) and a kshetra (a holy place near a temple).Sand (1990) pp. 41‚Äì42 The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Chandrabhaga. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.Bakker (1990) p. 78 The second version of the legend depicts Vithoba appearing before Pundalik as the five-year-old Bala Krishna (infant Krishna). This version is found in manuscripts of both Puranas, Prahlada Maharaj, and the poet-saints, notably Tukaram.Sand (1990) p. 50 The remaining version of the Pundalik legend appears in Sridhara and as a variant in the Padma Purana. Pundalik, a Brahmin madly in love with his wife, neglected his aged parents as a result. Later, on meeting sage Kukkuta, Pundalik underwent a transformation and devoted his life to the service of his aged parents. Meanwhile, one day, Krishna comes to the forest Dandivana, near Pundalik's house, in search of his angry wife Rukmini, who has left him. After some coaxing, Rukmini was pacified. Then Krishna visited Pundalik and found Pundalik serving his parents. Pundalik threw a brick outside for Krishna to stand on. Krishna stood on the brick and waited for Pundalik. After completing his services, Pundalik asked that his Lord, in the Vithoba form - waiting arms-akimbo on the brick, remain on the brick with Rukmini, in Rakhumai form, and bless his devotees forever.Pande (2008) p. 508 See also * Panduranga Mahatyam, 1957 Telugu film based on his life story.

It is the regional capital and was officially founded in July 1966. The city was used as a base of operations by the South African Defence Force (SADF) during the South African Border War. Oshakati is divided into the electoral constituencies of Oshakati East and Oshakati West.  History  In Oshiwambo, the language of the Ovambo, the town's name means \\"that which is in between\\", although some believe that the name (Oshakati, also Otshakati) was used to refer to the broadcast tower (275 m high), the tallest structure downtown and in Namibia. Oshakati is one of Namibia's largest cities and it is located near the B1, Namibia's main highway, which stretches from South Africa through the capital Windhoek and on to the Angolan border. The Oshakati town, (popularly known as 'Otshakati tsha Nangombe' by the native Kwambi people) is within the Kwambi traditional authority. On 19th February 1988, a bomb blast occurred in Oshakati at the First National Bank, killing 27 people and badly injuring nearly 30 others, most of them nurses and teachers.

She was systematically beaten into submission, then repeatedly raped to make her fit for the trade. She was sold to three different brothels in Mumbai, at prices ranging from 5000 to 7000 rupees. In addition to the sex work she was forced to do in the brothel at a minimum of three customers per night (with an average of eight), she was sent to various city hotels dressed in European style clothes to entertain customers for 180 rupees per night until at last a hotel manager reported her to the police. Following the public outcry, the governments of India and Nepal signed a 1985 cooperation agreement addressing the rescue and repatriation of Nepali girls trafficked into brothels in India.  Rescue  Ten months later, in November 1982, when she was brought to Bombay's JJ Hospital, she was suffering from three types of sexually transmitted diseases, genital warts and brain tuberculosis which left her spastic and permanently using, and finally led to her death. The People's Health Organisation embarked on a full-fledged \\"Save Tulasa\\" campaign, and with the support of the media managed to rescue her. At the hospital, Tulasa was given police protection against possible reprisals from the prostitution industry. After a period of stay in the Dongri Remand Home, she returned to Nepal to take up residence in the Cheshire Home For the Disabled in Jorpati. Doctors evaluated Tulasa and found her to be severely damaged physically and psychologically. Over the years, she remained incoherent and rambling in her speech. She used a wheelchair full-time and complained that her stomach hurt all the time, and that she could not go to the toilet. Attempts were made to return her to her father, Bir Dhoj Thapa, but she was rejected by his second wife (Tulasa's mother had died shortly after her abduction), and eventually her family stopped visiting her. In 1994 Tulasa broke her leg in a suicide attempt.  Death and media outcry  She was released from her institution in 1995, seemingly cured, but had a relapse and died that same year at age 24 of the tuberculosis she had acquired while enslaved as a sex worker in India. The resulting media outcry resulted in the governments of India and Nepal signing a treaty for the rescue and repatriation of Nepali girls from Indian brothels. In India the sentence for trafficking with minors has been hiked from 7 years to 13. Child prostitution has been reduced by about 40% but remains a major problem and no accurate figures are available. According to Reuters (Masako Iijima, \\"S. Asia Urged to Unite Against Child Prostitution,\\" Reuters, June 19, 1998), over 40% of 484 prostituted girls rescued during major raids of brothels in Bombay in 1996 were from Nepal. In 2000, she was back in the news for a short time as the verdict was delivered in the case against her persecutors. In the first report recorded on December 6, 1982, Tulasa had named 32 people responsible for abducting her and selling her to different brothels. These included taximen, the abductors and the brothel-owners. She also named three other Nepali men, Kancha Sarkhi, Lal Bahadur Kani and Uttam Kumar Pariyar, whom the Nepal government had arrested and finally sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Out of the 32 people arrested by Bombay police, seven were charged but released due to a lack of evidence. Only one of the nine suspects faced trial, the rest having hidden themselves away. The single accused was released by the judge on grounds of inadequate evidence.

It is situated on the small river Luhe, near its confluence with the Elbe, approx. 25 km southeast of Hamburg, and 20 km northwest of L√ºneburg.  History  Winsen was first mentioned in a document of the Diocese of Verden in 1158. Winsen Castle, first mentioned in 1315,H. Sudendorf, Urkundenbuch zur Geschichte der Herz√∂ge von Braunschweig und L√ºneburg und ihrer Lande Band I (Hannover 1859), no. 279, document of 28 November 1315 was built at a crossing over the Luhe to protect the harbor. At the beginning of the 15th century, the Church of Saint Mary was built. In 1593, Dorothea of Denmark, widow of William the Younger, moved into Winsen Castle and lived there until her death in 1617. During this time, the Marstall (stables) was built. In the Thirty Years' War, Danes invaded the town and burned down about 25 houses. On 1 May 1847, Winsen was connected to the Hanover‚ÄìHamburg railway of the Royal Hanoverian State Railways. On 1 July 1972, thirteen previously independent villages, Bahlburg, Borstel, Gehrden, Hoopte, La√ür√∂nne, Luhdorf, Pattensen, Rottorf, Roydorf, Sangenstedt, Scharmbeck, St√∂ckte and T√∂nnhausen, were incorporated into the town.

The castle served long periods of its history as an administrative building and was the seat of Gro√üv√∂gte, Amtm√§nner and Landr√§te. Today, it is the seat of the Amtsgericht; therefore, the rooms are generally not open to the public. In 2008, an exhibition was opened in the castle tower.  Marstall  The Marstall was originally used for horse and carriage. Although a timber beam shows the year 1599, the year of construction is unknown.Ilona Johannsen: Der Marstall und seine Nutzung, Niedersachsenbuch 2008 Winsen (Luhe), Nieders. Ministerium f√ºr Inneres und Sport, pp. 32‚Äì33. Today, the four-story half- timbered building contains the tourist information center, the public library, the museum of local history and an event room. On the eastern gable, a modern carillon is installed.Ilona Johannsen: Der Marstall und seine Nutzung, Niedersachsenbuch 2008 Winsen (Luhe), Nieders. Ministerium f√ºr Inneres und Sport, pp. 32‚Äì40.  Church of Saint Mary  The construction of the late Gothic hall church started around 1415. The choir was covered in 1437, the nave in 1465. The church has only one side aisle and the vault of the nave never was finished. In the 1950s, the interior decoration was changed. The colorful windows were designed and produced by Claus Wallner between 1958 and 1966. The altarpiece, the baptismal font and the bronze pulpit plates were made by Fritz Fleer. Friedrich Meinecke, born in Winsen, created the statue of Luther. Like the 62-meter-high neo-Gothic bell tower, it was completed in 1899.Kurt Schoop: Geschichte der Winsener Kircht√ºrme in: Winsener Geschichtsbl√§tter, no. 11, 1930, p. 41 sq.  Blauf√§rberhaus  The oldest still existing residential house is located in the Luhestra√üe. The Blauf√§rberhaus (blue dyer's house) was built on the Luhe island immediately after the great town fire in 1585. The gable is richly decorated with Renaissance motifs. The building is not open to the public.  Saint George's Chapel  Formerly outside the town, a leprosarium, the St. Georg foundation, was established in 1401.Uta Reinhardt: L√ºneburger Testamente des Mittelalters 1323 bis 1500, Hanover 1996, no. 58, p. 85. Explicitly mentioned as leprosarium in: L√ºneburger Testamente no. 103 on 4 February 1414. The chapel was first documented in 1445. The present hospital building was constructed in 1766, the chapel was built in 1750 and got its current appearance in 1903.  Further buildings  Historic buildings of the old town are situated on the Luhe island, specifically in Deichstra√üe, M√ºhlenstra√üe, Luhestra√üe and Kehrwieder. The Alte Stadtschule (old town school) was erected in Eckermannstra√üe in 1893 in historicism style. It is the oldest school in Winsen and nowadays a pure primary school. In the upper floor of the main building, there is a historic auditorium that is used for events. On the opposite side of the street, the gymnasium of the MTV Winsen built in 1889 was located. It was destroyed to the ground in a fire in April 2016. The half- timbered building was the first gymnasium in Winsen. The historic town hall was built in 1896. The former Amtsschreiberhaus ([scrivener]'s house) was mentioned in a document in 1714. The hotel \\"Zum Wei√üen Ro√ü\\" already existed in 1684. It was the residence of Edwin von Manteuffel, commander of the Prussian Army in Austro-Prussian War, in 1866.

Patrick Henry Village (PHV), was a United States Army family housing area located in the vicinity of Heidelberg, Germany, adjacent to and just south of the small town of Eppelheim. It opened in 1947 after World War II and was named after Patrick Henry, first and sixth Governor of Virginia. PHV was at its height populated with up to 16,000 Americans. The housing area closed on 6 September 2013. For the vast majority of its existence, PHV was not fenced, gated, or in any other way not completely open to entry and transit by the general public. After the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, fences were built around the living quarters so that no one could enter without an authorized U.S. government ID card. Also, the yearly German-American 'Volksfest' was moved to nearby Patton Barracks, for security reasons. In 2002, the US Army planned a large extension of the housing area. However, soon afterwards the Army announced the closure of all Heidelberg and Mannheim facilities. Patrick- Henry-Village was officially closed on September 6, 2013, after all military personnel were moved to the new headquarters of the United States European Command at Wiesbaden. On 2 June 2014, the site was transferred to the Institute for Federal Real Estate. Former facilities In its final state, Patrick Henry Village had a large number of educational, recreational and public facilities as well as shops and dining facilities. Schools included Patrick Henry Elementary School (Grades K-5) and Heidelberg Middle School (Grades 6-8), as well as a guest Canadian elementary/middle school (Grades K-8) for the children of Canadian military personnel. Recreational facilities included a gym, a bowling alley, a miniature golf course, a movie theater, tennis courts and baseball fields, the Heidelberg Non-Commissioned Officer's Club, and the Heidelberg Commissioned Officer's Club. Public services included a clinic for dentistry, a barbershop, a library, a post office, and a Roman Catholic and Protestant church. Patrick Henry Village Library Card (defunct) Present usage At the end of 2014, parts of the installation were used as an emergency shelter for refugees as a reaction to the refugee crisis. From summer 2015 on, the shelter was extended to the Bedarfsorientierte Erstaufnahmeeinrichtung Heidelberg in order to house and process asylum seekers according to the regular procedure with a capacity of ca. 4.000 persons (as of October 2015). The Minister of Science of Baden-W√ºrttemberg Theresia Bauer demanded the restoration of more buildings in PHV so that more refugees can be housed there, but Heidelberg's Deputy Mayor Eckart W√ºrzner objected her request and insisted on a decentralized accommodation within Heidelberg as well as on a fairer distribution of refugees in Baden- W√ºrttemberg. The federal government of Baden-W√ºrttemberg decided regardless that Patrick-Henry-Village should become the central processing hub for three- fourths of all refugees of the southwest. It was planned that refugees should pass 40 procedures there, which combine the identification, health check, registration and application for asylum. Furthermore, asylum applicants who were sent to the rural districts get cited to appear at Patrick Henry Village again for their asylum hearing to take place.

It also serves as the home ground of Carmelita, who rent the stadium from Alajuelense. The stadium, which holds a capacity of 17,895 people, is named after Alejandro Morera Soto, a notable former player of LD Alajuelense, FC Barcelona and H√©rcules CF. History Construction The project to find a proper site for a permanent home started in 1938 when the director of the club, Carlos Bola√±os, proposed that the club should purchase its own land. The land was purchased in 1940, but the site would not be soccer-ready until 1942, when Alajuelense played its first match at the site. The first game was played on January 18, 1942 when Liga Deportiva Alajuelense played Club Sport Cartagines. The Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto is known as the Cathedral of Costa Rican Soccer. On September 27, 1949, a professor from a local high school named Armando Morux Sancho started what was called \\"La marcha del ladrillo\\" (The Brick's March) in which every student would donate a brick to help building the concrete walls of the stadium and start building the concrete stands. The first stands that were built were the ones located in north, west an east around the pitch. On July 20, 1966, due to a motion by the Municipality of Alajuela, the stadium was renamed to honor the great Alajuelense and Barcelona player Alejandro Morera Soto. On March 19, 1970 the stadium saw its first night game when Alajuelense faced Honduras Club team Motagua, beating them 4-1. In 1979, the enlargement of the stadium was initiated with the project of building a second stand on top of the first already built and add an additional stand over the dressing and conference room (south) and also, add roof to the stand located on east and the one located on south after was finished. The project was fully completed in 1984. The stadium was re-inaugurated that year along with the new illumination, which was at the moment, in the top illuminations systems. Development Costa Rican football started getting more attention by the international press after the national team participated to the World Cup in 1990 and with footballers playing abroad. The club decided to build a royal box in the top of the west stand, which would have a two-floor royal box with TVs, carpet, bathrooms, elevator and air conditioner. The royal box was finished in 1999 and is the only team in Costa Rica with such an amenity. In 2002, the illumination system was upgraded, being the stadium with the best illumination in the country. Until 2005, the Morera Soto's grass was known as the best natural one in Central America, but a combination of fungus and hurricanes affected the grass and it never fully recovered. By the end of 2008, the management of the team decided to install a fifth-generation synthetic grass, in order to have the field always ready for games no matter the weather, also have the availability to rent the venue for music concerts and/or special events and have the possibility for the younger divisions to train in the same field. The last game the team played on the natural turf was the first game of the 2008 winter's final, beating their archrival Deportivo Saprissa 2‚Äì0 on December 17, 2008. In 2009, the club installed a synthetic turf called Xtreme Turf from ACT Global Sports.synthetic turf This football turf has achieved FIFA two-star certification for approval for top international matches. This is the only FIFA two-star installation currently in Central America. After a long delay, the field was ready to be used by July 18, 2009. The field's re- opening game was held against Caracas FC from Venezuela; the game ended up with a tie 1‚Äì1. On July 3, 2011, the stadium name was changed from \\"Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto\\" to \\"Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto Scotiabank\\", due to a newly acquired sponsor from Scotiabank to the team. International events The stadium is not only home to Liga Deportiva Alajuelense, but it is also shares itself along with Estadio Ricardo Saprissa Aym√° and Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica as the home of the Costa Rican National team. It is also the host stadium of the 2010 CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championship. During the 2014 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, held in Costa Rica, the Stadium became one of the four locations used for this tournament. During the first round, it was used for the Mexico-Colombia, Nigeria-China, Mexico-China, Nigeria-Colombia, Venezuela- Italy, and North Korea-Germany games. It ranked as first in terms of attendance on games where Costa Rica itself (the local team) did not participate (5,683 people watched the last two games). It will be used to host matches during the 2020 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup with the country and Panama. Other events One of the main concerts the stadium received was Elton John during his tour \\"Made in England\\" in November 1995. The also British Iron Maiden played in this stadium in 2009. Also, Korn and P.O.D. offered a joint concert at the stadium in 2010. The stadium received two WWE house shows, the first was a SmackDown show held on February 13, 2010. A second show was a RAW show, held on February 25, 2011.

It is a popular strategy for keeping opponents insulated from sensitive information, and acts as a form of insulation when the level of noise in the venue is such that normal on- field communication is difficult. Commonly the leader of the huddle is the team captain and it is the captain who will try to inspire other team members to achieve success. Similarly after an event a huddle may take place to congratulate one another for the team's success, or to commiserate a defeat. The term \\"huddle\\" can be used as a verb as in \\"huddling up.\\" The huddle is commonly used in American football and Canadian football to strategize before each play; the offensive team's huddle is almost always led by the quarterback, and the defensive huddle is typically led by one of the linebackers. It is also popular in basketball, football, volleyball and cricket. The huddle became more widely used in cricket after the India national team used it to great success during the 2003 Cricket World Cup. The England team has imitated this technique with some success, notably in the 2005 Ashes series. Types Circular Baker Wildcats huddle up during a game Gallaudet University is Home of the Huddle. The first football huddle began in 1894. Gallaudet quarterback Paul Hubbard is credited with creating the football huddle during that season when Gallaudet went up against two different deaf schools. GU went 5-2-1 in 1894 and defeated the Pennsylvania Deaf School, 24-0, and the New York Deaf School, 20-6. Hubbard was worried that the other teams were stealing Gallaudet's plays because his signing was out in the open. He decided to circle up his teammates and the huddle was born. https://www.gallaudetathletics.com/sports/fball/homeofthehuddle This type of huddle is still in common use today, typically between plays in American Football as the quarterback assigns the next play to the offense. Typewriter The typewriter huddle is a huddle formation created by former Florida State Head Coach Tom Nugent in the mid-1950s. It is typically used between a coach and multiple players, or when a quarterback or other player wants to create an image of being separate from the team, dictating to them, rather than being a part of the group, as with the circular huddle. The players being spoken to are arranged in two or more rows, the front row often kneeling or crouching. The player or coach speaking can then be assured that he has the attention of the entire audience, something that often is not possible if that person is in the center of a circular huddle. Though allowing players breathing room and providing space for more participants than a circular huddle, it is not as secure, as observers on the sidelines may be able to see hand signals or read the speaker's lips.  American football  Pittsburgh Steelers in an NFL huddle. Offensive players gather in a rough circle out of hearing of the opposing defense to plan the next play. In American football, though seemingly random, huddles can have several forms. Before the 1890s, football players did not form huddles; they instead discussed the play far enough from the other team that they could not be overheard. As American football became more organized and formalized, so too did the huddle. The football team at Oregon Agricultural College was one of the first schools nationally to use the huddle formation in a game. It happened against the University of Washington in Seattle during the 1918 season. Head coach Bill Hargiss instructed the starters that once they returned to the field, they were to stand 10 yards behind the ball before the beginning of each play and whisper to one another what they were going to do next.http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv11/CFHSNv11n2c.pdf#2 An eyewitness to the game was veteran Seattle sports columnist Royal Brougham, whose stories of the contest give testimony today to the program's early use of this pioneering new formation. Others trace the huddle to the 1890s in Gallaudet College. in Washington, D.C.. Paul Hubbard, a deaf player who went to Gallaudet, used the strategy to avoid having the other team see his sign language between plays; he and his team huddled to conceal the signs.Gannon, Jack. 1981. Deaf Heritage: Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, pp. 272, 276 (PDF) During a game, the quarterback uses the huddle to communicate the next play to the offense. National Football League Rule 5 Section 2 stipulates that no more than eleven players may be in the offensive huddle. An offensive substitute who communicates with a teammate in a huddle would be penalized for \\"unsportsmanlike conduct\\"; this is to prevent teams from feigning a substitution and taking advantage of the chaos to confuse opponents. In some situations, teams may choose not to call a huddle and employ a hurry-up no- huddle offense to maximize time and surprise the defense.  Snap (gridiron football)  In a snap, the snap count is decided on in the huddle, usually expressed as \\"...on .\\" being the final words spoken by the quarterback after calling the play but before the huddle breaks and the players go to the line of scrimmage. The snap count allows offensive players to have a small head start. Association football UEFA Cup final, 2003 In Association football (soccer), the huddle has been used before games by Brazil and the Ireland national teams and club teams such as Derry City FC. Celtic FC from Scotland have used the huddle as a pre-match ritual since 1995, although this was pre- dated by St. Mirren FC (also from Scotland) who had been using the huddle since 1993. Celtic copied this and in turn is now carried out by all levels and ages of the Celtic club and often imitated by the supporters. The supporting visual aspect of this, although culturally unrelated can also be seen as similar to The Poznan. Australian football In contrast to other sports, the huddle is a specific tactic in Australian football, used by the team kicking in after a behind is scored, or some delayed stoppage. All players in the backline gather together about fifty meters from goal. Then, the players individually lead away from the huddle in all directions. The technique means that there will be several leading players, making it difficult to defend the first kick-in. It also allows teams to run set plays for the second and third kicks. The huddle was developed during the 1970s, and is still used today by many teams.

Orka originally wore a belt which by psionic means provided the added power of a killer whale to the character's already considerable strength. The belt also allowed Orka to exist for indefinite periods on land although he was not at full strength due to dehydration. Using surgical and electrochemical enhancements, the Brand Corporation augmented Orka's natural abilities, which allowed him to retain his strength without the use of the belt. The experimentation also increased Orka's size, resilience and endurance, but at the cost of reduced intelligence. Orka can communicate with and summon killer whales through high-pitched whistles; so long as there are killers whales in his vicinity Orka's physical abilities increase several time over. He can also swim at superhuman speeds. In other media Orka appears in the Avengers Assemble episode \\"Kingbreaker\\" Pt. 1, voiced by Roger Craig Smith. This version is a commander who is loyal to Attuma and replaces Tiger Shark as the head of Attuma's armed forces. When Black Panther, White Wolf, and Attuma's daughter Lady Elanna bring their fight with Killmonger, Tiger Shark, and the Atlantean soldiers on their side to Atlantis' Coral Guard, Orka and his soldiers show up. When he learns of the coup and Tiger Shark claims that Attuma has gotten soft, Orka sides with Elanna and his soldiers lock up Killmonger, Tiger Shark, and the traitorous Atlantean soldiers. Then he apologizes to Elanna for hesitating. Orka later assists in rescuing the Atlantean civilians from the damages caused by Princess Zanda's bombs and was present when Killmonger kills Attuma. As Black Panther and White Wolf go after Killmonger, Orka gives Lady Elanna her father's trident and swears her in as the new ruler of Atlantis.

He was one of the first photographers to travel to the Far East, documenting the people, landscapes and artefacts of eastern cultures. Upon returning home, his work among the street people of London cemented his reputation, and is regarded as a classic instance of social documentary which laid the foundations for photojournalism. He went on to become a portrait photographer of High Society in Mayfair, gaining the Royal Warrant in 1881. Early life The son of William Thomson, a tobacco spinner and retail trader, and his wife Isabella Newlands, Thomson was born the eighth of nine children in Edinburgh in the year of Queen Victoria's accession. After his schooling in the early 1850s, he was apprenticed to a local optical and scientific instrument manufacturer, thought to be James Mackay Bryson. During this time, Thomson learned the principles of photography and completed his apprenticeship around 1858. During this time he also undertook two years of evening classes at the Watt Institution and School of Arts (formerly the Edinburgh School of Arts, later to become Heriot-Watt University). He received the \\"Attestation of Proficiency\\" in natural philosophy in 1857, and in junior mathematics and chemistry in 1858. In 1861, he became a member of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts, but by 1862 he had decided to travel to Singapore to join his older brother William, a watchmaker and photographer. Early travels King Mongkut of Siam, Bangkok (European Dress), 1865‚Äì1866 In April 1862, Thomson left Edinburgh for Singapore, beginning a ten-year period spent travelling around the Far East. Initially, he established a joint business with William to manufacture marine chronometers and optical and nautical instruments. He also established a photographic studio in Singapore, taking portraits of European merchants, and he developed an interest in local peoples and places. He travelled extensively throughout the mainland territories of Malaya and the island of Sumatra, exploring the villages and photographing the native peoples and their activities. After visiting Ceylon and India from October to November 1864 to document the destruction caused by a recent cyclone, Thomson sold his Singapore studio and moved to Siam. After arrival in Bangkok in September 1865, Thomson undertook a series of photographs of the King of Siam and other senior members of the royal court and government. Prea Sat Ling Poun, Angkor Wat, 1865 Inspired by Henri Mouhot's account of the rediscovery of the ancient cities of Angkor in the Cambodian jungle, Thomson embarked on what would become the first of his major photographic expeditions. He set off in January 1866 with his translator H. G. Kennedy, a British Consular official in Bangkok, who saved Thomson's life when he contracted jungle fever en route. The pair spent two weeks at Angkor, where Thomson extensively documented the vast site, producing some of the earliest photographs of what is today a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Thomson then moved on to Phnom Penh and took photographs of the King of Cambodia and other members of the Cambodian Royal Family, before travelling on to Saigon. From there he stayed in Bangkok briefly, before returning to Britain in May or June in 1866. While back home, Thomson lectured extensively to the British Association and published his photographs of Siam and Cambodia. He became a member of the Royal Ethnological Society of London and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1866, and published his first book, The Antiquities of Cambodia, in early 1867. Travels in China Foochow and the River Min After a year in Britain, Thomson again felt the desire to return to the Far East. He returned to Singapore in July 1867, before moving to Saigon for three months and finally settling in Hong Kong in 1868. He established a studio in the Commercial Bank building, and spent the next four years photographing the people of China and recording the diversity of Chinese culture. Thomson traveled extensively throughout China, from the southern trading ports of Hong Kong and Canton to the cities of Peking and Shanghai, to the Great Wall in the north, and deep into central China. From 1870 to 1871 he visited the Fukien region, travelling up the Min River by boat with the American Protestant missionary Reverend Justus Doolittle, and then visited Amoy and Swatow. He went on to visit the island of Formosa (modern-day Taiwan) with the missionary Dr. James Laidlaw Maxwell, landing first in Takao in early April 1871. The pair visited the capital, Taiwanfu (now Tainan), before travelling on to the aboriginal villages on the west plains of the island. After leaving Formosa, Thomson spent the next three months travelling 3,000 miles up the Yangtze River, reaching Hupeh and Szechuan. Thomson's travels in China were often perilous, as he visited remote, almost unpopulated regions far inland. Most of the people he encountered had never seen a Westerner or camera before. His expeditions were also especially challenging because he had to transport his bulky wooden camera, many large, fragile glass plates, and potentially explosive chemicals. He photographed in a wide variety of conditions and often had to improvise because chemicals were difficult to acquire. His subject matter varied enormously: from humble beggars and street people to Mandarins, Princes and senior government officials; from remote monasteries to Imperial Palaces; from simple rural villages to magnificent landscapes. Later life The Crawlers, London, 1876‚Äì1877 Thomson returned to England in 1872, settling in Brixton, London, and, apart from a final photographic journey to Cyprus in 1878, Thomson never left again. Over the coming years he proceeded to lecture and publish, presenting the results of his travels in the Far East. His publications started initially in monthly magazines, followed by a series of large, lavishly illustrated photographic books. He wrote extensively on photography, contributing many articles to photographic journals such as the British Journal of Photography. He also translated and edited Gaston Tissandier's 1876 History and Handbook of Photography, which became a standard reference work. In London, Thomson renewed his acquaintance with Adolphe Smith, a radical journalist whom he had met at the Royal Geographical Society in 1866. Together they collaborated in producing the monthly magazine, Street Life in London, from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text the lives of the street people of London, establishing social documentary photography as an early type of photojournalism. The series of photographs was later published in book form in 1878. He was elected a member of the Photographic Society, later the Royal Photographic Society, on 11 November 1879. With his reputation as an important photographer well established, Thomson opened a portrait studio in Buckingham Palace Road in 1879, later moving it to Mayfair. In 1881 he was appointed photographer to the British Royal Family by Queen Victoria, and his later work concentrated on studio portraiture of the rich and famous of High Society, giving him a comfortable living. From January 1886 he began instructing explorers at the Royal Geographical Society in the use of photography to document their travels. After retiring from his commercial studio in 1910, Thomson spent most of his time back in Edinburgh, although he continued to write papers for the Royal Geographical Society on the uses of photography. He died of a heart attack in 1921 at the age of 84. Legacy Thomson was an accomplished photographer in many areas, including landscapes, portraiture, street photography, and architectural photography, and his legacy is one of outstanding quality and breadth of coverage. His photography from the Far East enlightened the Victorian audience of Britain about the land, people, and cultures of China and South-East Asia. His pioneering work documenting the social conditions of the street people of London established him as one of the pioneers of photojournalism, and his publishing activities mark him out as an innovator in combining photography with the printed word. In recognition of his work, one of the peaks of Mount Kenya was named \\"Point Thomson\\" on his death in 1921. That same year, Henry Wellcome acquired a collection of glass negatives, totalling over 600, that were owned by Thomson. Today they are in the collection of the Wellcome Library. Some of Thomson's work may be seen at the Royal Geographical Society's headquarters in London. Through the Lens of John Thomson: China and Siam, a selection of Thomson's photographs from the Wellcome Library, London, is currently touring internationally. Controversy In 2001 Phiphat Phongraphiphon, a Thai independent researcher in historical photography, published claims that Thomson took works by Thai court photographer Khun Sunthornsathitsalak (Christian name: Francis Chit) and published them as his own. Evidence to Phiphat's claims include an analysis of a photograph in which the temple Wat Ratchapradit, which was built before Thomson arrived in Bangkok, is missing.

This river originates at a small town called Bhira in the Indian state of Maharashtra, 150 km south east of Bombay (Mumbai). The important towns located on the banks of Kundalika are Kolad, Korlai, Chaul, Roha and Salav. Details River Kundalika is fed by the excess water from Tata Power's Mulshi Dam Project on to a series of hydroelectric projects and dams, including Ravalje followed by Bhira and then Dholvan, where the water is released in the morning typically at 6am. The gush of the water reaches Sutarwadi at 7:30am and water rises at Kolad at 10:00am. A historical trade route called Savalya Ghat descends in Kundalika Valley from Tamhini Ghat Road. Beautifully carved staircases exist at some places, and there are two small water cisterns. This river was a means of trade in ancient times. There are many forts on the hills along the river, including Surgad, Avchitgad, Birwadi fort, Korlai fort and Revdanda. On the bank of River Kundalika are many retreats and farm houses with mango and watermelon as the chief fruit product, and rice and nachni as the chief farm produce. The soil is very rich in minerals and water is ample via canals fed from River Kundalika's clean water. Over 90% of Kundalika's water is consumed by industries, including RCF's THAL Project and many MIDC all across. This unfortunately has resulted in pollution, especially dues to Roha's chemical industries releasing a lot of effluents (chemical waste) in the river. On the cards are to use 9000 Quesecs of water by the upcoming Reliance and Essar's new projects in the Villa MIDC. This could kill the rafting besides considerably reducing the river's downstream water levels at Kolad. The river will die a little more and become more placid and shallower. The Kundalika's water is beginning to get affected and \\"Save Kundalika Project\\" is being undertaken by \\"EcoMantra Nature Awareness and Travel\\", a local sustainable and community tourism organisation that runs a unique eco camp on its bank at Kolad. Adventure lovers have found a unique way of enjoying the release of the dam water. Capitalising on the location near Mumbai, with its virtually unending source of adventure lovers, rafting is conducted on the river using the rapids generated by the rushing water released from the dam. Rafting of grade II and III can also be experienced over a 14 km circuit and can be enjoyed all day in the monsoon, or to coincide with the timing of the release of water from the dam during other times of the year. Rafting here is sometimes unavailable in the peak of summer, when the water becomes scarce. Bhira Hydroelectric Project The Planning Commission has given investment clearance for the scheme \\"Upper Kundlika Project (Revised Medium) in Maharashtra\\". The project is estimated to cost Rs 154.916 crore (2009-10 price level). The plant's maximum output capacity is nominally 300 MW, generated by six 25 MW Pelton turbines and a 150 MW pumped storage generator added in 1997. In 2014 two 10 kW microturbine units were added to generate further power from the tailrace after the main turbines.

Within the area referred to as \\"The Bluff\\" lie the suburbs of Brighton Beach, Grosvenor, King's Rest, Ocean View, Fynnland, Treasure Beach and Wentworth. The name of the area is derived from the long bluff - two ancient sand dunes on which most of the suburbs lie. The Bluff is one of the main enclosing elements of Durban Harbour from the Indian Ocean, and forms the southern quayside of the Port of Durban.  History  The promontory on which Bluff is situated is Durban's most prominent natural landmark. Accordingly, it probably served as an important visual reference for navigational approaches into Durban Harbour. Between 1907 and 1975, the exposed south-east side of The Bluff housed a whaling station. Since the mid-Nineteenth Century, the region has been purposed for navigational and military uses. This use has provided protection for much of the area's native vegetation. Today, the area is considered important in the ecological management of Durban and environment. The traditional Zulu name for Bluff is isibubulungu, meaning a long, round- shaped ridge. It also means \\"white man‚Äôs bluff\\", which may be a reference to habitation by shipwreck survivors. The Bluff promonotory is a remnant of an extensive coastal dune system that formed along the shoreline of KwaZulu-Natal between two and five million years ago. Features The Bluff is a popular holiday destination, with extensive accommodation and plentiful seaside recreation. The area is known for its abundant sea life, including dolphins, and, in the winter months, whales. There are two main beaches: Brighton Beach and Anstey's, while smaller, lesser-known beaches to the north are Garvie's, Crossways and Ranch, first and second cove, and Pig's Hut beneath the police station. Further along you will find Treasure beach and Cuttings beach. There is golf course and a wetland area with a large population of various bird species. At the south end of the Bluff is the South Durban Basin (as the area is known); there are five main residential suburbs: Austerville, Merebank, Merewent, Stanvac and Treasure Beach. Interspersed among the houses are a number of industries, including two of South Africa‚Äôs largest oil refineries (Sapref and Engen facilities), the Mondi paper mill and other smaller factories. Durban's main airport was nearby until 2010. Durban International Airport moved and changed its name on May 1, 2010, relocating from the South Durban Basin to near Ballito, on the North Coast. The mixture of residential homes and large industries in the basin creates a challenge for all those who live and work in the area. Air pollution, water pollution, overcrowding and litter are some of the problems that residents and industries need to, but will never resolve.

Johnny denies any knowledge about the Vespas and makes a pointed reference to Tony's continued denial that Tony B was involved in the hit on Joey. Tony suspects Johnny seized the whole shipment for himself, and sends Benny and a member of Carlo's crew to the port to investigate. They brutally interrogate a security guard, who tells them that Phil took the scooters. A shipment of expensive Italian cheeses is coming in; fearing more financial losses, Tony loses his temper in front of his crew. Tony asks Tony B and Christopher to remove three bodies from Uncle Pat Blundetto's farm in Kinderhook, New York, which is about to have new owners. Chris complains to Adriana about the two Tonys' past treatment of him. Adriana suggests they leave New Jersey and start over elsewhere, but Chris replies that he is a soldier for life. Despite early tensions, Chris and Tony B bond as they gradually dispose of the bodies. However, when Tony comes to oversee the completion of the job, the two older men fall back into their routine of picking on Chris. He passes up an opportunity to go hunting with them and leaves the farm early the next morning, driving home in tears. Tony returns to the Bada Bing and, prompted by a TV documentary he has seen, talks about terrorist threats tied to unexamined cargo containers at the ports. When Georgie Santorelli remarks that \\"you have to live for today,\\" Tony suddenly explodes in fury and gives him a beating that sends him to the hospital, and causes some permanent hearing loss. Afterwards, Tony is remorseful, and gives Paulie a wad of bills and insists that he make sure Georgie receives the best care. Paulie then tells Tony that Georgie is quitting his job at the Bing and doesn't want to see him again.

Tony is infuriated over the publicity brought to his family and storms into Janice's house late at night, demanding she plead guilty to the charges and that Bobby \\"take control\\" of his wife. Citing her recent bellicose behavior, Bobby gives Janice an ultimatum to either see an anger management specialist or end their marriage. Janice starts attending anger management classes and tells Tony that they have helped her make tremendous progress; Tony says he is happy for her. The \\"Soprano temper\\" becomes the focus of Tony's next session with Dr. Melfi, who observes that depression and anger are both traits in Tony's family. Tony joins Janice and Bobby for dinner, but becomes irritated when he sees Janice deal calmly with a series of minor annoyances. He breaks the calm by provoking his newly placid sister with sarcastic and increasingly hurtful comments about her estranged son, Harpo. Janice soon gets enraged and chases Tony round the room with a fork in her fist. Smiling to himself, he leaves. First appearances *Uncle Pat Blundetto: Tony S and Tony B's uncle who was given an early retirement from the DiMeo crime family because of health issues. He settled on a large farm in Kinderhook, New York, where he was often visited by his nephews Christopher, Tony S, and Tony B during their childhoods. Title reference *Tony tells Dr. Melfi that \\"revenge is like serving cold cuts\\" (inadvertently mangling the adage \\"Revenge is a dish best served cold\\"). In the episode Johnny Sack continues to interfere with Soprano business in retribution for the murder of \\"Joey Peeps.\\" *In a scene at Uncle Pat's farm, Christopher, Pat, and Tony B eat cold cut sandwiches for lunch. *The title may also refer to the dead bodies Tony B and Christopher are looking for in this episode. Connections to previous episodes * Christopher and Tony Blundetto dig up and dispose of Emil Kolar's skeleton, moving his body for the second time. Christopher shot and killed Emil in the Pilot episode. Then, he and Pussy Bonpensiero unsuccessfully tried to put Emil's body into a dumpster. Later, they buried the body under a bridge somewhere. But, the burial was giving Christopher nightmares. So, Christopher and Georgie later dug up the body and relocated it in \\"The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti.\\" * When Tony confronts Janice over the assault, she tells him that the woman is lucky she didn't kill her. Tony responds, \\"Well, we know that.\\" This refers to the killing of Richie Aprile by Janice in \\"The Knight in White Satin Armor.\\" * The woman Tony sleeps with was previously encountered in \\"Irregular Around the Margins\\" as an employee of the dermatologist's office where his cancerous mole was removed. * Tony previously assaulted Georgie in Season 1, Episode 2 \\"46 Long.\\" Exasperated by Georgie's clumsy way of handling a phone call, Tony took the phone and bashed him on the head with it. Other cultural references * Of Johnny Sack's belief that Tony Blundetto killed \\"Joey Peeps,\\" Silvio comments that Sack should be \\"out looking for the real killers, instead of spending all his time on the golf course.\\" This line is a not-so-subtle jab at O. J. Simpson, who in the years after his acquittal on murder charges claimed to be seeking \\"the real killers\\" while he was often criticized for spending much of his free time playing golf. * Dr. Melfi quotes W.B. Yeats' \\"The Second Coming\\" during a session with Tony in this episode. This poem will later be used prominently in Season 6 (including an episode titled \\"The Second Coming\\"). * Tony mentions to Dr. Melfi that John Gotti had a bad temper when he tells her about Janice going to anger management. * On the drive to Kinderhook, Tony B confides to Christopher: \\"that 'Legend of Sleepy Hollow' cartoon used to scare the piss out of me\\" and adds that \\"very sorry people\\" used to call Tony B Ichabod Crane. According to a notation by Washington Irving, the character of Ichabod Crane was based on a schoolteacher whom Irving befriended in Kinderhook, New York, in 1809. * In the audio commentary, the episode's director, Mike Figgis, points out how the scene where Christopher and Tony Blundetto dig up the skeletal remains of a man Christopher knew (and killed) symbolically referenced the famous Yorick scene in Hamlet. * Christopher, as in episodes before, once again mistakenly calls Emil Kolar a Czechoslovakian when, in fact, he was a Czech-American. Paulie Walnuts once confused Chechens with Czechoslovakians in \\"Pine Barrens.\\" * When Uncle Pat remembers where the missing bodies are buried, Christopher likens him to Johnny Mnemonic. * When Tony is flipping channels, obscure Cartoon Network show Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones? is seen on the TV. * At a diner, Tony B mentions to Tony that Christopher has the same car (Hummer H2) as Schwarzenegger. Tony then erroneously calls it \\"the Humvee.\\" * Tony misquotes the Phoebe Snow song \\"Harpo's Blues\\" (from her eponymous 1974 album) as \\"Harpo's Song\\" when he is deliberately attempting to provoke Janice during this episode's final scene. * At dinner, when Bobby Jr. makes reference to a ‚Äú...G5. It has 64-bit...‚Äù he is referring to a Power Mac G5. Music * The piano song played at the wedding shop visited by Christopher and Adriana is \\"Music Box Dancer,\\" written by Frank Mills. * The song played at the Bada Bing! before Tony beats Georgie up is \\"Stop\\" by Joe Henry, which Henry's sister-in-law Madonna has performed as \\"Don't Tell Me\\". * The song played over the end credits is a live version of \\"I'm Not Like Everybody Else\\" by The Kinks, which is featured in their 1996 album To the Bone.

The movement dates to the 1830s and 1840s, but lasted into the 1880s, when it branched out into other cultural movements. Even though it primarily followed a romantic impulse, it incorporated stylistic and philosophical elements of other 19th century movements such as Naturalism or Symbolism. The name does not indicate a particular style, but rather the cultural circumstances in which it bloomed. Overview Along with the later modernisme, this movement ended a period of Catalan cultural decline commonly known as Decad√®ncia, that dated back at least to defeat in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714)Art Nouveau in Catalonia, on GaudiAllGaudi.com. Accessed 26 March 2006. and the subsequent Nueva Planta decrees, which suppressed Catalonia's traditional institutions, privileges, and fueros beginning January 16, 1716. Thus, the aim of this movement was the full restoration of Catalan as a language of culture, not only through the promotion of various forms of art, theatre and literature in this language, but also attempting to establish a normative standard for the language, something however not fully accomplished until the first quarter of the 20th century. As with most of the other Romantic movements, it was noted for its admiration of the Middle Ages, which was often reflected in art, and in Barcelona, the literary contest known as Jocs Florals or Jocs de la Gaia Ci√®ncia was revived. The Renaixen√ßa occurred not only in Catalonia proper, but also in other Catalan-speaking regions such as the Balearic Islands.The Renaixen√ßa , part of Els Moviments Literaris Contemporanis a les Balears , on mnm.uib.es. Accessed 26 March 2006.

It is situated on the southern (left) bank of the river Elbe, approx. 30 km southeast of Hamburg, and 20 km north of L√ºneburg. Its seat is in the village Marschacht. The name refers to the marshes (German: Marsch) along the Elbe. The Samtgemeinde Elbmarsch consists of the following municipalities: # Drage # Marschacht # Tespe Cancer cluster Elbmarsch is the epicenter of a notable pediatric cancer cluster that persisted for over 15 years. Although a sparsely populated region a high rate of childhood leukemia was observed with an incidence in the region that is significantly higher compared to Germany as a whole. No unique hazards have been identified. The community is surrounded by two nuclear establishments. A possible accidental release of radionuclides in 1986 was hypothesized. Ionizing radiation is another exposure conclusively linked with childhood leukemia. Survivors (within 1000 m) of Hiroshima and Nagasaki developed leukemia 20 times more frequently than in unexposed populations. The Kr√ºmmel Nuclear Power Plant began operations near Elbmarsch, Germany in 1983. Like Fallon, Nevada, the nearby population is quite small, including approximately 9,000 children within 10 km of the plant. Over a one and a half year period, six cases of leukemia and one case of aplastic anemia were identified among children in this area, a 41.5 increase over national incidence rates. Four more cases were diagnosed during a subsequent two-year period. Public health officials began to suspect that high levels of airborne tritium ‚Äúmight be involved either directly or as an indicator for earlier releases of other short-lived radionuclides‚Äù. The community surrounding the Savannah River nuclear facility in the U.S. was chosen for comparison with the ‚Äúcluster‚Äù noted around the Kruemmel site. The tritium burden around the Savannah River site is significantly higher than the measured burden in Germany; however, the incidence of leukemia in South Carolina was not increased. Differences in population density, proximity to the power plant, and route of tritium exposure (inhalational versus oral via drinking water) may account for the lack of correlation between the two sites, or there may be alternative explanations for the increased incidence of hematopoietic malignancy between 1989 and 1991 in Elbmarsch. Some of these alternative hypotheses have included electromagnetic fields, parental radiation exposure prior to conception, other carcinogens, and benzene exposure; however, none have been supported by the existing evidence. Intriguingly, a larger case-control study in Lower Saxony found a correlation between the ‚Äúuntrained immune system‚Äù (as judged as contact with other children, vaccinations, etc.) and leukemia risk, suggested that an immature immune system that has not been challenged is at greater risk for developing malignancy, possibly secondary to an undefined environment insult.

History  The Sisi Chapel was built on the occasion of the marriage of Empress Elisabeth and Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria on April 24, 1854, in Vienna. Johann Carl Freiherr von Sothen commissioned architect Johan A. Garben to design the chapel and construct it in Am Himmel, a popular recreational area between the Sievering area (D√∂bling district) and the Vienna Woods. The chapel was intended to serve both as a memorial to the historic event and a gravesite for Freiherr von Sothen and his wife Franziska. The chapel was erected between 1854 and 1856 according to the plans of Garben by the city builder Josef Kastan. The chapel was consecrated to the patron saints of the Imperial couple on July 31, 1856: Saint Elisabeth, Saint Francis of Assisi, and Saint Joseph. Sisi Chapel view from the northeast In the 20th century, the chapel decayed as a result of atmospheric action, contaminant loads, and acts of war. To prevent vandalism, the altarpiece was dismantled. In 1997, the \\"Caucus Wood\\" acquired a large part of the Am Himmel area and purchased the chapel for 3,500 Euros from Caritas in 2002. The Caucus then initiated the renovation of the chapel as part of the overall revitalization of the area. After several years of work, which required a total of 1.1 million Euros partially financed by the Vienna Old Town Preservation Fund, the chapel was completed in 2005. During the renovation, the inner room was reshaped to give a tangible experience of how nature and culture are interrelated. To accomplish this, a new glass roof was mounted.

The genus is named for \\"an Otomi Indian, Casimiro G√≥mez, from the town of Cardonal in Hidalgo, Mexico, who fought and died in Mexico's war of independence.\\" http://www.calflora.net/southafrica/1C-F.html Description Mature C. edulis trees range from tall and are evergreen. The leaves are alternate, palmately compound with three to five leaflets, the leaflets 6‚Äì13 cm long and 2.5‚Äì5 cm broad with an entire margin, and the leaf petiole 10‚Äì15 cm long. The fruit is an ovoid drupe, 5‚Äì10 cm in diameter, with a thin, inedible skin turning from green to yellow when ripe, and an edible pulp, which can range in flavor from bland to banana-like to peach to pear to vanilla flan.photo 1photo 2photo 3 The pulp can be creamy-white in green-skin varieties or a beige-yellow in yellow-skin varieties and has a smooth texture similar to ripe avocado. It contains from one to five seeds that are said to have narcotic properties.  Chemical constituents  In the past 40 years, experiments have been carried out on the white sapote's seeds that have yielded the identity of many pharmacologically active compounds, including: N-methylhistamine, N,N-dimethylhistamine, and histamine. It also contains 2‚Ä≤,5,6-trimethoxyflavone, 2‚Ä≤, 6',5,6,-tetramethoxyflavone (zapotin), and 5-hydroxy-2‚Ä≤,6,7-trimethoxyflavone (zapotinin).  Health effects  Several in vitro studies have shown that zapotin has potential anticarcinogenic effects against isolated colon cancer cells. The fruit has long been thought to produce drowsiness, as claimed by Francisco Hern√°ndez de Toledo in the 16th century, but this may be a misinterpretation of the Nahuatl name of the plant, cochitzapotl (meaning '\\"sleep-sapote\\"), as its seeds were processed to produce a poison by the Aztecs, and the seeds and leaves, but not fruit pulp of the plant, contain sleep-inducing compounds. Taxonomy Unlike the mamey sapote, white sapote is a member of the family Rutaceae, to which citrus belongs. The black sapote is also unrelated and is actually a species of persimmon. This confusion may be because \\"sapote\\" comes from the Nahuatl (Aztec) word tzapotl, used to describe all soft, sweet fruit. Commonly grown in northern New South Wales, Australia, and often mistaken for a persimmon, these two fruits are unrelated. See also *List of culinary fruits References Further reading *Huxley, A.

He batted and threw left-handed. Walker started and filled various relief roles coming out from the bullpen as a closer, middle reliever, and set-up man as well. His most productive season statistically came in 1970 with Pittsburgh, when he finished 15‚Äì6 (3‚Äì1, three saves in relief), while his 3.04 ERA, .714 winning percentage, and 7.1 hits per nine innings all ranked him third among National League pitchers. He also fired a pair of two-hit shutouts. That year, the Pirates won the National League East title for their first post-season berth since winning the 1960 World Series. However, they were swept by the Cincinnati Reds in the NLCS. Walker was the losing pitcher in Game Two, giving up two runs (one unearned) in seven innings in a 3‚Äì1 Reds victory. Bobby Tolan scored all three Reds runs, including a home run off Walker in the fifth inning. In 1971, Walker went 10‚Äì8 with a 3.55 ERA for the 1971 World Series champion Pirates. On July 18 of that year, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Three Rivers Stadium, he had a no-hitter broken up by a Joe Ferguson home run (the first of Ferguson's Major League career) with no outs in the ninth. The hit was the only one he would allow in a 7‚Äì1 Pittsburgh victory. In Game Four of that year's World Series, which the Pirates won in seven games over the Baltimore Orioles, Walker threw the first pitch in a night game in World Series history. His outing was brief: Paul Blair, Mark Belanger and Merv Rettenmund began the game with consecutive singles off Walker to load the bases. After Blair scored on a passed ball, Walker intentionally walked Frank Robinson to re-load the bases. He was then pulled after giving up consecutive sacrifice flies to Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell for a 3‚Äì0 Baltimore lead. Walker was then taken out of the game. The Pirates later scored two runs in the bottom of the first, the tying run in the third, and the go-ahead run (the game ended by that 4‚Äì3 score) in the seventh, and Bruce Kison threw 6 scoreless innings in relief of Walker. The Orioles got only one hit after Walker's departure, a Blair double off Kison in the second. In a nine-season career, Walker posted a 45‚Äì47 record with a 3.65 ERA and 558 strikeouts in 243 appearances, including 100 starts, 16 complete games, seven shutouts, nine saves, and 824 innings pitched. He was also a weak batsman, garnering only 11 hits in 188 at-bats for an .059 batting average. According to former Pirate great Steve Blass during one of Hank Aaron's last appearances at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, Luke hit a rare single. The ball was fielded and thrown to first base where Aaron was positioned. The home crowd erupted in cheers, which Aaron mistakenly assumed were for him, as is common even in road games when great players make their final plays. So Aaron doffed his cap to acknowledge the adulation. But the crowd was actually cheering Walker, who turned to Aaron and said \\"Put your hat on Hank, they're cheering for me\\"..

It is situated approximately 25 km south of Hamburg, and 6 km east of Buchholz in der Nordheide. Jesteburg is also the seat of the Samtgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Jesteburg. In Jesteburg lies the confluence of two small rivers, the Schmale Aue and the Seeve. History The first official mentioning of Jesteburg dates back to the year 1202, in a document signed by the Hartwig II, Archbishop of Bremen. The castle which gave the town its name is supposed to have guarded the Seeve passage until the 13th century. Remains of this Burg have not yet been found. In 1872/73, the railroad between Buchholz in der Nordheide and L√ºneburg which still runs through Jesteburg was built. During an Allied air raid on nearby Hamburg in January 1943 incendiary bombs where dropped on Jesteburg, several buildings where destroyed. On 19 April 1945, the railroad bridge was blown up by the Wehrmacht to slow the advance of British troops. Between 1933 and 1945 the population of Jesteburg nearly doubled, mostly due to refugees. Attractions In 1986/87, the Heimathaus was re-erected on the Niedersachsenplatz. The Heimathaus is a 450-year-old building originally from Eyendorf. The town of Jesteburg also hosts the Kunstst√§tte Bossard, an expressionist Gesamtkunstwerk.

It lies on the southwest shore of Lough Neagh, near Derrywarragh Island, in the northwest corner of the county. As it sits between the estuaries of the rivers Blackwater and Bann (which are only two miles apart), Maghery was of strategic significance in the past. In the 2001 Census Maghery had a population of 2001 people. It lies within the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area. It has a park.  History  Name Maghery is a shortening of the older name Magherygreenan, which is anglicized . Maghery Christian Heritage Site In the Maghery area there is a tradition of an ancient road between Armagh and Coney Island known as St Patrick's Trail, which in the past facilitated travel through Armagh to the north and the south of the county via causeways. Various stretches of this trail have also been identified in the neighbouring townland of Derrylileagh as well as a number of others in the locality. Significant events * In November 1830 Ribbonmen attacked an Orange band, puncturing some of their drums. In retaliation the Orangemen 'completely wrecked' (burned to the ground) the Catholic village of Maghery in the passive presence of Colonel Verner (a magistrate) and some of the constabulary police. Seven Orangemen were later charged with offences relating to the attack. All were acquitted. However, some of the victims submitted accounts of the attack to the Parliamentary Select Committee that investigated Orange parades and violence in 1835. The following account of three of their submissions is taken from 'Two Hundred Years in the Citadel'; a research paper by Dr. Peter Mulholland, an anthropologist from the nearby town of [Portadown]. > Eleanor Campbell, sworn: ‚ÄìResides in Maghery and keeps a public house; it is > near the Blackwater foot, near the quay; was there on Monday the 22nd > November last, between 11 and 12 o‚Äôclock, as near as she can recollect; was > out standing before the door; a great number of men came down across the > fields and attacked the house; four men attacked the four windows; deponent > then went into the house for fear of her life; the windows were smashed, > sashes and all; they attacked deponent‚Äôs two daughters in her house, to beat > and abuse them; two young men of the party came in, and one of them fired a > gun in the house up at the deponent‚Äôs son, who was on the loft and had made > a noise to come down when he saw the men going to abuse his sister; the > skirts of the deponent‚Äôs son‚Äôs coat appeared as if they had been perforated > with shot from the gun; it might have been done with slugs; four or five men > then attacked the deponent herself with bayonets, and threatened to take her > life if she would not give up a gun which they said she had; they swore > deponent on her hand and by the five crosses to tell where it was, and > deponent had to send out for it; they got it, and took it away.

A number of persons on both sides received wounds of a more or > less serious nature inflicted with stones and other weapons used during the > progress of the affray. Information was subsequently conveyed to Portadown, > and District Inspector Bigley, Head Constable Donnelly, Sergeants Belford > and McQueen, and all the available constables in both barracks drove out to > the scene of the disturbances. Acting on information received some time > after their arrival in Maghery, the police arrested two prominent members of > the Orange party, and when conveying them to the Birches police barrack they > were fired at by a crowd of Nationalists.

Biography John William Merrow, son of Moses H. and Ella R. A. (Proctor) Merrow, was born in New Hampton, New Hampshire. Known throughout his life as \\"Will,\\" to distinguish him from his at-the-time better- known uncle, John Francis Merrow, he graduated from New Hampton Literary Institute (now known as New Hampton School) in 1892 and from the New Hampton Commercial College in 1893. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1897 with an A.B. degree and later attended the architectural course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His first professional association was with the architectural firm of Wheelwright & Haven in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1900, he was the architect of the East Blue Hill Library in East Blue Hill, Maine, designed in the American Craftsman style. In 1990, this structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Also in 1900, he redesigned the interior of the New Hampton Community Church on Main Street in New Hampton, New Hampshire. He was employed by his uncle Frederick Freeman Proctor (popularly known as \\"F. F. Proctor\\"), owner of Proctor Theatrical Enterprises in New York City, designing and \\"supervising the building of numerous theatres in and out of the city, in addition to keeping all of the houses owned by Mr. Proctor up to modern requirements and standards\\". In 1905, he was the architect of Proctor's Palace Theatre and Proctor's Palace Roof Theatre, on Market Street between Halsey and Washington Streets, in Newark, New Jersey. This was one of the rare \\"double decker\\" theatres, an eight-story complex with a large 2,300-seat theatre at ground level and a smaller theatre of about 900 seats occupying the top four floors beneath the roof. This theatre is described more fully in Warren G. Harris's article under Frederick Freeman Proctor. After 1909, he was the architect of Frederick Freeman Proctor's country estate, known as \\"Proctoria,\\" in Central Valley, New York. He remodeled the old farm house, designed cottages for each of Proctor's two daughters, and created several lakes. The estate was purchased during World War II by the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, for use as a recreation center for cadets. In 1973, the USMA transferred the estate's locally famous gatehouse complex (designed by Merrow) and the adjacent land to the Woodbury Historical Society in Highland Mills, New York. In 1921, he designed the Theta Delta Chi fraternity house in Hanover, New Hampshire on the basis of plans created by Arthur Bradley Barnes. John William Merrow never married. He was a member of the New York Athletic Club, Dartmouth Club, Technology Club of New York, Theta Delta Chi fraternity, and the Union Lodge of Masons in Bristol, New Hampshire. At the time of his death, he was living in New York City. He is buried in the Merrow family lot in the New Hampton Village Cemetery, New Hampton, New Hampshire. Sources *\\"Nephew of F. F.

Named for Nereus, an aquatic deity from Greek mythology, she was the second U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Nereus was laid down on 4 December 1911, and launched on 26 April 1913 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, and commissioned on 10 September 1913. Service history Detached from Naval Overseas Transportation Service on 12 September 1919, Nereus served with the Atlantic Fleet until decommissioned at Norfolk on 30 June 1922. She was laid up there until struck from the Navy List on 5 December 1940. Sold to the Aluminium Company of Canada on 27 February 1941, Nereus operated out of Montreal carrying bauxite from the Caribbean to aluminum plants in the United States and Canada. Her master (commanding officer) was John Thomas Bennett of the Canadian Merchant Navy. Loss Nereus was lost at sea sometime after 10 December 1941 while steaming from St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands (along the same route where her sister ship had disappeared) with ore destined to make aluminum for Allied aircraft. Nereus was presumed sunk after being torpedoed by a German U-boat. However, there are no German U-boat claims for this vessel.Uboat.net forum The wreckage has never been located nor the actual cause of her disappearance determined.Canadian Merchant Ship Losses of the Second World War, 1939-1945 A memorial listing for her crew can be found on the CWGC Halifax memorial.Commonwealth War Graves Commission The initial presumption of the cause of her loss was that she was sunk by a German U-boat. No direct evidence, however, has been found to support this theory. The website U-Boat.net lists neither the Nereus nor the Proteus among the ships known to have been sunk by U-boats. A Canadian website suggests Nereuss possible fate.Canadian Merchant Ship Losses of the Second World War, 1939-1945 The website states that Rear Admiral George van Deurs, USN researched the losses of the Nereus and her sister ship Proteus and came to the conclusion that the colliers broke up in heavy seas following a storm. A contributing factor may have been that, as observed in other colliers of this type, the acidic coal they had carried had seriously eroded the ships' longitudinal support beams, thereby, making them extremely vulnerable to breakage under stress. Another theory is that the vessel's disappearance can be attributed to the Bermuda Triangle.Eyers, Jonathan (2011). Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions.

Stenia is a genus in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It was established by John Lindley in 1837. These epiphytic plants occur in warm, humid habitats of Trinidad and the Amazonian slope of the northern Andean region in South America. This genus as a rule lacks pseudobulbs and consequently produces tufted fan-like growths of fairly erect narrow, short leaves, and conforms to the sympodial method of growth. Stenia plants produce a short, creeping or erect, single-flowered inflorescences, growing laterally. The flowers are medium-sized, with equal petals and sepals. All members of this genus have their flowers dominated by the large, shoe-like, concave labellum (lip) with a disc-like, toothed crest. The flowers have four elongate pollinia, with the upper pollinia long and narrow. They occur at any time of the year, though slightly more concentrated during summer in cultivation.  Species  Though this genus has been known to science since the early 19th century, most species were not discovered until the late 20th century. # Stenia angustilabia D.E.Benn. & Christenson (Peru) # Stenia aurorae D.E.Benn. & Christenson (Peru) # Stenia bismarckii Dodson & D.E.Benn.

His work often depicted workers as its subject and was inherently political. He was among more than a generation of eastern European Jewish artists who emigrated to escape persecution and worked abroad. For eleven years he lived in Ystradgynlais, a mining community in South Wales. Biography Herman was born in Warsaw into a Jewish family, on 3 January 1911. He attended the Warsaw School of Art where he trained as a typesetter and graphic designer and then for two years worked briefly as a graphic artist. In 1938 at the age of 27, Herman left Poland for Brussels to escape anti-Semitism. He was introduced to many of the prominent artists then working in the city. After the beginning of World War II and the German invasion of Belgium, he escaped to France and then to Great Britain. He first lived in Glasgow, where he met fellow artist Jankel Adler and between 1940 and 1943 he contributed to a remarkable wartime artistic renaissance in the city. He then moved to London, where he met numerous other European √©migr√©s, such as the Hungarian Michael Peto, with whom he became friends. When Peto decided to go into photography after the war, Herman encouraged him in his new endeavour and supported his progress as a photojournalist. In 1942 Herman learned through the Red Cross that his entire family had perished in the Warsaw Ghetto. In 1943 he held his first London exhibition with L. S. Lowry. Herman's own style was bold and distinctive, involving strong shapes with minimal detail. He continued to work up to his death in 2000. Herman studied working people as the subjects of his art, including grape pickers, fishermen and, most notably, coal miners. The latter became a particular interest for Herman during the eleven years that he lived in Ystradgynlais, a mining community in South Wales, beginning in 1944.Sonia Williams, Welsh Arts Archive He became part of the community, where he was fondly nicknamed \\"Joe Bach\\" (Little Joe). \\"Miners, 1951 - Josef Herman\\" , Swansea Heritage.net, accessed 13 October 2010 Among his creative collaborators and friends in Wales was the artist Will Roberts, who lived in Neath.\\"Will Roberts RCA Memorial Exhibition - A National Library of Wales touring exhibition\\", National Museum Wales, 2001, accessed 13 October 2010 Herman is quoted as saying: \\"I stayed here because I found ALL I required. I arrived a stranger for a fortnight. The fortnight became eleven years.\\" When commissioned in 1951 to paint a mural for the Festival of Britain, Herman took coal miners as his subject. His work Miners (1951) showed six men resting above ground after their work. Herman said, \\"I think it is one of my key pictures and the most important one I did in Wales.\\" The mural is held in the permanent collection of the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, affiliated with the Swansea Museum. Some of Herman's work was collected by the Davies sisters, British art patrons and collectors in Wales, as part of their 20th- century holdings. They bequeathed their joint collection of 260 works, particularly strong in Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings and sculptures, to the National Museum Wales in the mid-20th century, greatly expanding its range.Art: \\"Davies Sisters Collection\\" , National Museum Wales, accessed 13 October 2010 Leaving Wales in 1955 because his health was affected by the damp climate, Herman lived briefly in Spain and then in London.

In 1955 Herman moved to Suffolk with his partner, Nini Ettlinger, whom he married in 1961. The death of their young daughter prompted them to move away and from 1972 Herman lived in the house in West London where he died in February 2000. In 1981 Herman was awarded an OBE for services to British Art and was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts in 1990. Legacy and honours *2004, the Josef Herman Foundation was established in Ystradgynlais, to honour the artist and his legacy, and encourage study of his work, as well as arts initiatives in South Wales. *2010, Michael Waters' play, The Secret of Belonging, about Josef Herman and his years in Ystradgynlais, was produced by the National Theatre Wales.

They are Beienrode, Essehof, Essenrode, Flechtorf, Gro√ü Brunsrode, Klein Brunsrode, Lehre, and Wendhausen with Lehre being the largest. History Kampst√ºh In 1934, construction began on the Army Ammunition Institute in the Kampst√ºh Forest east Lehre. More than 100 buildings on were constructed and was connected to the railway system. The Institute produced ammunition for infantry weapons, anti-tank mines, tank shells, artillery guns and .38 cm. Up until February 1945, 6,000 tons of chemical weapons were transported to the Institute. It was not bombed during World War II and up until the end war, most of these weapons remained on site. In 1945, the location also housed Russian prisoners of war. On 11 April 1945, the area was liberated by the United States' 5th Armored Division and the Army Ammunition Institute was occupied without a fight. In mid 1945, the area was handed over to British troops who had a local presence until 1951. Today, many original buildings still remain standing and some are still in use. Transportation Road Lehre is located on State Road (Landesstra√üe) L295 which provides access to freeways A2 and A39. Train Lehre rail service began when the Brunswick State Railway Company completed the Schunter Valley Railway in 1904, connecting Braunschweig with Fallersleben.

Between 1952 and 1977 it was a separate city. Until 1954 it was known as Czechowice.  History  In the area that is today Ursus, there were three villages in the 14th century: Czechowice, Skorosze and Szamoty (later called Go≈ÇƒÖbki). Industrialisation in the 20th century contributed to developing these villages. Skorosze became the seat of the municipality, and in the early 1920s the Szamoty area's Zak≈Çady Mechaniczne \\"Ursus\\" () (makers of agricultural machinery) were built. Czechowice became a housing estate due to it being in the vicinity of factories. In the 1939, before World War II, it had 7000 inhabitants. Skorosze had a school, police station and train station in its area. In 1952 Czechowice, Skorosze and Szamoty were combined into one city, called Czechowice, which in 1954 changed its name to Ursus (there had been another Czechowice-Dziedzice city already, located in southern Poland). From June 25 to June 30, 1976, the city of Ursus witnessed strikes after the communists raised food prices. Many people got injured and arrested. It was the signal that started Komitet Obrony Robotnik√≥w (KOR), a movement which was successful in uniting the workers and intellectuals against the communist government, which eventually led to the birth of the Solidarity movement. On August 1, 1977, Ursus became part of Warsaw within the Ochota district as punishment for the strikes in June 1976. Ursus lost its independence as a separate city.

On most box trucks, the cabin is separate to the cargo area, however some box trucks have a door between the cabin and the cargo area. The difference between a box truck and a van is that the cargo van is a one-piece (unibody), while a box truck is created by adding a cargo box to a chassis cab. North American usage Chevrolet box truck UPS Freight box truck Box trucks are typically in length and can range from Class 3 to Class 7 (12,500 lb. to 33,000 lb. gross vehicle weight rating). They often have a garage door-like rear door that rolls up. They are often used by companies transporting home appliances or furniture, or are used as moving trucks which can be rented by individuals. Ford, Dodge and Chevrolet/GMC have historically been the most common manufacturers of conventional cab/chassis to which the cargo box is attached by various producers (called body builders or upfitters). Isuzu Motors, Mitsubishi Fuso Truck of America, Inc. and UD Trucks have been the most common producers of cab over-type medium duty cab/chassis used as platforms for box trucks. Small box trucks often use the cab of full size vans from Ford, Chrysler or General Motors (eg Ford E-Series/Econoline/Ford Transit, Dodge Ram Van, Chevrolet Express/Chevrolet Van/GMC Vandura/GMC Savana), though pre- manufactured cutaway van chassis vehicles are the basis (rather than an actual cargo van), in order to reduce the labour required for production. Box van definition in British English  In British English, box van is a term for a four-wheeled covered goods wagon (freight vehicle) with a fully enclosed body. In British English the word truck refers to large open topped freight vehicles or rail freight waggons. A lorry is a HGV road vehicle. A van is used for an enclosed railway freight carriage or medium or smaller commercial road vehicles.  Luton body  1933 Bedford two-ton Luton van. A Ford Transit van with Luton body A Luton body is a style of commercial vehicle body incorporating an enclosed box body extended over the cab. It takes its name from the town of Luton, in Bedfordshire, where the Bedford commercial vehicle plant was located. This style of body was designed to accommodate the high volume low weight loads of straw hats which were part of Luton's industry. Straw hats were wrapped in hessian fabric in long cylinders to fit across the width of the van. It was incidental that it was the home of Bedford although all the early Luton vans were on Bedford chassis. The body style is common in medium commercial vehicles such as the Ford Transit, as well as larger vehicles especially those used by household removals companies. More modern examples may be streamlined to reduce wind resistance. Some commercial vehicles have a wind deflector on the cab roof, but this is not a Luton body: the Luton is functional and can be accessed from the main body. The portion of the body that rests over the cab is referred to as the peak, also referred to, in some quarters as a Luton, or a kick. Many commercial vehicles have tilting cabs. To allow for this the floor of the Luton may be hinged, and there may be a hinged flap at the front.

It also forms part of the border between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, flowing between Counties Tyrone and Monaghan, intersecting into County Monaghan briefly. Its source is to the north of Fivemiletown, County Tyrone. The river divides County Armagh from County Tyrone and also divides County Tyrone from County Monaghan. Route The river enters Lough Neagh west of Derrywarragh Island and is navigable from Maghery to Blackwatertown. The small Maghery Canal enters the Blackwater south of Derrywarragh Island. Nearby, a small jetty area with a slipway is the site of the former Maghery ferry. Approximately 4 km from Maghery ferry is the entrance to the river 200m beyond Bond‚Äôs Bridge. Just past it, on the east bank, is a large country house estate called The Argory, donated to the National Trust by the MacGeough-Bond family. The Callan River joins the Blackwater 1.6 km upstream. Further on, at a bend on the east bank, is the entrance to the first lock of the Ulster Canal. Just upstream, Charlemont Bridge joins the village of Charlemont on the east bank and The Moy on the west. The Blackwater's length is 91.3 km (56.75 mi).Ordnance Survey of Ireland: Rivers and their Catchment Basins 1958 (Table of Reference) If the Blackwater's flow is measured through its path through the 30 km (19 mi) Lough Neagh and onwards to the sea via the 64.4 km (40ml) Lower Bann, the total length is 186.3 km (115.75 mi). This makes the Blackwater‚ÄìNeagh‚ÄìBann the longest natural stream flow in Ulster and is longer than the Munster Blackwater. Ancient name Anciently the River Blackwater was known in Irish as Cluain-Dabhail meaning \\"meadow of Dabhal\\". This was anglicised as Clanaul, the former name of the parish of Eglish, as well as Glenaul, which was used as the name of the former local District Electoral Division of Armagh Union.Archive.org, Ulster Journal of Archaeology It has also been known as An Abhainn Mh√≥r (The Great River). An area of Blackwatertown, past which the river flows, is known as Avonmore, mirroring the name of the nearby river.http://www.placenamesni.org/resultdetails.php?entry=8899 Angling In the lower part of the reach mainly upstream of Blackwatertown Bridge, coarse fish abound, but there is a short stretch of good game fishing water downstream of the island where there are a number of known salmon lies. Game fish stocks are now recovering following a drainage scheme in the late 1980s and restoration of the system. History The inland waterways network of Ireland had developed in the later part of the eighteenth century, and in 1814, the Directors General of Inland Navigation were keen to join the various parts together. This required a link between Lough Neagh and Lough Erne, and another between Lough Erne and the River Shannon. Accordingly, they asked John Killaly, their engineer, to look at the first of these routes, \\"in general terms\\". Although the Directors did not proceed immediately, due to lack of funds, the scheme was revived in 1822 and the canal was eventually completed in 1841. Below the first lock at Charlemont, the canal joined the river, and used the river channel to reach Lough Neagh. The venture was not a success, as significant volumes of traffic failed to develop, and the canal was taken over by the Board of Works in 1851. Meanwhile, The Office of Public Works (The O.P.W., often known as 'the Board of Works') had obtained powers in 1842 to carry out various projects around the Lough Neagh basin, with the intent of improving drainage, navigation and mill-power. Following a survey by their engineer John McMahon, a scheme was developed to make the Lower Bann navigable from Lough Neagh to the sea. This involved removing a great shoal of rock at Portna which had the effect of lowering the level of Lough Neagh by around . This had a significant effect on the Blackwater, and major work was required on the river to keep it navigable. The Maghery Cut, which gave access to Lough Neagh to the south of Derrywarragh Island, had to be made deeper and wider, and the channel of the river was dredged, to maintain a navigable depth. The final lock on the Coalisland Canal and the Ulster Canal had to be reconstructed with a lower cill and deeper gates, to accommodate the lower level of the river, as did the final lock on the Newry Canal where it joined the Upper Bann. The total cost of the project, split between navigation and drainage work, was estimated at ¬£183,775. The cost of work on the Blackwater exceeded that on any of the other tributaries to Lough Neagh. While the first of the river above the lough was large and wide, considerable work was needed between there and Blackwatertown to eradicate sharp bends and shoals. New sections of river channel were cut, and were made between wide, with their depth sufficient to provide of water when Lough Neagh was at it lowest designed level during the summer months. Excavated material was used to backfill the old river channels, so that loss of land was reduced. To protect the surrounding low-lying land from flooding by the river, the channel was embanked. The embankments were designed with self-acting sluices, to allow tributaries to pass through them when water levels were suitable. After some of the embankments had been finished, local landowners petitioned against their completion, as they felt that the lower level of Lough Neagh and the works already carried out gave them sufficient protection, and it was inadvisable to completely protect the land. The defenses work was thus deferred. The original plans were to embank the Tall River and the Callan River which joined together to the south of Clonmain, and flowed into the Blackwater below Charlemont bridge. This aspect of the project was reworked, and a new straight cut was made from a point on the Tall River to the north of Clonmain, crossing Sir William Verner's bog, and rejoining the Blackwater just above Verner's Bridge, some below the original confluence. This had the advantage that under flood conditions, the water level in the Blackwater was from lower than that further upstream. The channel below Verner's Bridge was also considerably wider, and so could better cope with the volumes of water discharged by the two tributaries. The project took eleven years to complete, by which time costs had overrun by ¬£50,000. The government were approached to make up the shortfall, and did so. When the scheme began, there was to be a single controlling authority to maintain the works, with the more profitable Lower Bann helping to fund the less profitable Blackwater and Upper Bann. However, by the time it was completed, three separate and independent trusts were set up. The Upper Bann and the Blackwater were managed by the Upper Bann Navigation Trust. The counties to the south of Lough Neagh were expected to fund their part of the drainage and navigation works, and to contribute ¬£800 per year towards the running of the Trust, with no income to meet this figure. The Lower Bann Navigation Trust and the Lough Neagh Drainage Trust were wound up in 1929, with their responsibilities passing to the Ministry of Finance, but despite vigorous campaigning by the counties supporting the Upper Bann Navigation Trust, the government refused to disband it, and it continued to be funded until 1954, when the Ministry of Commerce took over the waterways and effectively closed them.

Sarma is co-author of The Inversion Factor: How to Thrive in the IOT Economy (MIT Press, 2017) along with Linda Bernardi and the late Kenneth Traub. The book charts the evolution of three IoTs‚Äîthe Internet of Things (devices connected to the Internet), the Intelligence of Things (devices that host software applications), and the Innovation of Things (devices that become experiences). Sarma is founder of the company IoTask, which provides consulting and advisory services on establishing and standardizing internet of things systems across a number of industry sectors. Prof. Sarma is a frequent industry speaker and serves on the Board of Governors of EPCglobal and GS1 US,http://www.gs1us.org/about- gs1-us/corporate/board-of-governors and as a permanent guest of GS1.

Pitt was the inventor of the underwater cable ferry. His new invention was installed across the Kennebecasis River between Reed's Point and Gondola Point in 1903. Believing that the cable required to operated his new ferry was too heavy and bulky, Pitt decided the lay the cable out during the winter. He ran the ferry cable across the river allowing it to sink into place with the spring thaw. By the middle of the 20th century, New Brunswick's road network improved and cable ferries to carry passengers and vehicles could be found in many river communities.

The Golden Charter of Bern (also: Golden Bull, in German: Goldene Handfeste or Berner Handfeste) is a medieval charter purporting to have been issued by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. It establishes the town privileges of Bern (now the capital of Switzerland), making it an Imperial Free City and, effectively, an independent state. The charter is dated to 1218, but is now believed by most scholars to be a Bernese forgery from the middle of the 13th century. The charter's 54 articles provided for extensive privileges, including the free election of the Schultheiss (i.e., mayor) and the right to autonomously legislate. It also provided for the establishment of an Imperial Mint, which was established in 1228 at the latest, to coin Berner Pfennige. These rights were formally confirmed by King Rudolf I in 1274, and the issue of the charter's authenticity thus made moot. The charter is called \\"golden\\" due to its impressive (and undoubtedly authentic) golden bull, or seal. Its face shows Frederick on the throne with his Emperor's regalia, circumscribed \\"Frederick, by the Grace of God Roman King, ever increasing the Empire, King of Sicily.\\" The bull of the Golden Charter. The issue of whether the charter ‚Äî regarded as Bern's founding document for centuries ‚Äî is authentic has been contentious among historians since the 1860s. Modern researchers now seem to agree that it is a forgery done on behalf of Bern's government during the middle of the 13th century, done to establish in writing the rights the city had in practice seized decades previously. They point out that the exceptional liberties granted by the charter were very atypical for the time, and that the writing seems to match that of one writer in the Frienisberg monastery. Monasteries, at that time, were masters of the pia fraus, the \\"pious fraud\\" of falsifying documents to match a dead benefactor's supposed intent. On the other hand, X-ray analysis in 2002 did not reveal any indication that (as had been assumed) the authentic bull had been removed from an authentic document and then re-affixed to the Bernese charter.

L. paradoxus was unusual among advanced ornithischian dinosaurs in that it is speculated to have hunted or scavenged, with preserved gut contents showing that it may have eaten fish. Additionally, some features of its skeleton may suggest that it was partially aquatic.Ji Q., Wu X., Cheng Y., Ten F., Wang X., and Ji Y. 2016. Fish-hunting ankylosaurs (Dinosauria, Ornithischia) from the Cretaceous of China. Journal of Geology, 40(2). The type species L. paradoxus was named by Xu Xing, Wang Xiaolin and You Hailu in 2001. The generic name refers to Liaoning. The specific name refers to the confusing mix of nodosaurid and ankylosaurid features shown by the specimen.  Description  The holotype IVPP V12560 is an articulated skeleton measuring approximately in length. The specimen is unique among all known ankylosaur fossils in the retention of the external mandibular fenestra. Antorbital fenestrae may also be present. It has relatively large teeth, including teeth in the praemaxilla ( primitive or possibly juvenile trait). The points on the tooth crown were unusually long and sharp, giving each tooth a fork-like shape. It had long feet, long lower legs, and long, sharp claws on the hands and feet, unlike the blunt claws of other ankylosaurians. All of these were initially interpreted as juvenile features, given the specimen's small size and lack of fusion between the spine and hip bones.Xu X., Wang X.-L., and You H.-L. (2001). \\"A juvenile ankylosaur from China\\". Naturwissenschaften, 88(7): 297-300. However, information from a second specimen has led some scientists to conclude that the lack of hip fusion and long limbs and toes are in fact adaptations to a semiaquatic lifestyle. The large, fork-like teeth and sharp claws may have been adapted to catch fish and other small animals. Stomach contents recovered with the second L. paradoxus specimen show that fish may have formed part of the animal's diet. This indicates that Liaoningosaurus could have been either carnivorous or at least omnivorous, making it the first ornithischian thought to have adapted to such a lifestyle, though this is also suspected in more basal ornithischians like heterodontosaurs and now in pachycephalosaurids Another supposedly unique feature originally identified from the type specimen was the presence of armor plating on the belly. A large segment of what appeared to be the bone from a flat osteoderm covered the underside of the abdomen. This had a surface structure covered with small hexagonal and rhombic bumps. Such plates had never been found with other ankylosaurians, and it has been suggested that, if L. paradoxus was indeed semiaquatic, the belly plates may have protected it from predators attacking from below, as in modern turtles. Smaller triangular osteoderms were found on the shoulder, including a small shoulder spike. However, closer examination of the bumps seemed to suggest that they were not sculpted onto a single piece of bone, but instead resembled normal dinosaurian scales. The broken edges of the supposed plates, when studied in 2013 by paleontologist Victoria Arbour and colleagues, did not reveal any internal structure as would be expected from a piece of bone. Arbour and colleagues concluded that the \\"belly plates\\" were likely to be pieces of preserved skin.Arbour, V. M., Burns, M. E., Bell, P. R., & Currie, P. J. (2014). Epidermal and dermal integumentary structures of ankylosaurian dinosaurs. Journal of Morphology, 275(1): 39-50.  Relationships  Determining the relations of Liaoningosaurus is difficult because of the young age of the individual specimen and the presence of traits both typical of ankylosaurids and nodosaurids. Xu et al. published a cladistic analysis in 2001, placing Liaoningosaurus as an early branch within the Nodosauridae, while Vickaryous et al. provisionally assigned it to the Ankylosauria incertae sedis in 2004.Vickaryous, Maryanska, and Weishampel (2004). \\"Ankylosauria\\". in The Dinosauria (2nd edition), Weishampel, D. B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H., editors. University of California Press. A second cladistic analysis performed by Thompson et al. in 2011 suggested that Liaoningosaurus is a very basal ankylosaurid.

Case of the Bound Jizo In The Case of the Bound Jizo or Suspect Statue, ≈åoka Tadasuke was called upon to discover the thief of a cartload of cloth from a local kimono maker. ≈åoka ordered a statue of Jizo of the Narihira-san T≈çsen-ji, a temple in Tokyo, to be bound and brought forth to be called to answer for dereliction of its custodial duty. When the bound statue arrived in the courtroom, the spectators burst into laughter. ≈åoka sternly ordered each spectator to be punished with a token fine for their outburst. Each was ordered to provide a small swatch of cloth as a fine. When the spectators paid their fines, the robbed kimono maker identified the piece of cloth from one spectators as identical to the cloth stolen in the crime. The spectator, who was the actual thief, was arrested, and ≈åoka ordered the Jizo statue released as having discharged his duty. In 1925, the statue was removed from downtown Tokyo to a little temple called Nanjo‚Äìin on its outskirts. The statue still stands, and is wrapped in rope tied by hopeful victims of thieves.

Ghanaian main dishes are organized around a starchy staple food, with which goes a sauce or soup containing a protein source. The main ingredient for the vast majority of soups and stews are tomatoes- canned or fresh tomatoes can be used. As a result, nearly all Ghanaian soups and stews are red or orange in appearance. Main staple foods Ghanaian style banku The typical staple foods in the southern part of Ghana include cassava and plantain. In the northern part, the main staple foods include millet and sorghum. Yam, maize and beans are used across Ghana as staple foods. Sweet potatoes and cocoyam are also important in the Ghanaian diet and cuisine. With the advent of globalization, Cereals such as rice and wheat have been increasingly incorporated into Ghanaian cuisine. The foods below represent Ghanaian dishes made out of these staple foods. Foods made with maize *Akple, a traditional meal of the Ewe, is made with corn flour and can be eaten with pepper sauces, stews or any soup. It is typically served with okra soup (fetridetsi) or herrings stew (ab…îbitadi).Akple is never prepared in the same way as \\"Banku\\". An important distinguishing factor between the two products is that \\"Banku\\" requires the use of a special pre-formulated watery material called \\"Slightly-Fermented Corn-Cassava Dough Mix\\", cooked to a soft solid consistency of \\"Corn-Cassava Dough AFLATA\\", enroute to a soft delicious \\"Banku\\" with further cooking, and the \\"Slightly-Fermented Corn-Cassava Dough Mix\\" is never 'the signature material' of any form of the \\"Akple\\" product. An equally equivalent and factual statement is as follows; *Banku meal, with all its impressive varieties was formulated by the Ga Dangme(or Ga)-Tribe of the Greater Accra Region, as a slight deviation from the process of preparation of Ga-Kenkey, requiring a different manipulation of 'THE AFLATA' mixed with cassava dough, but unlike Ga-Kenkey it does not require the use of corn husk. One particular Major-Clan of the GaDangme(or Ga)-Tribe is credited with the original recipe of the 'banku meal' even though it may be argued among the Major-Clans. online reference, by J Dzeagu-Kudjodji and others; online publication : Banku, National of Ghana - EpersianFood ( Mar. 17, 2020 ) ; A grammatical sketch of Akra - or Ga-language ; etc.Sometimes only cornflour is used but in many areas cassava dough is cooked together with the fermented corn dough. *Mmore is cooked fermented corn dough without cassava, prepared like banku among the Akan people. *Kenkey/[Komi]/Dokonu ‚Äì fermented corn dough, wrapped in corn originating from the Ga who call it komi or Ga kenkey. Another variety originating from the Fanti people is Fante Dokono or Fanti Kenkey which is wrapped with plantain leaves that give it a different texture, flavour and colour as compared to the Ga kenkey. Both are boiled for long periods into a consistent solid balls. *Tuo Zaafi ‚Äì a millet, sorghum or maize dish originating from Northern Ghana *Fonfom ‚Äì a maize dish popular in south- western Ghana Foods made with rice *Waakye ‚Äì a dish of rice and beans with a purple-brown color. The color comes from an indigenous leaf known as sorghum bicolor. This side dish bears striking similarities to West Indian rice and peas. The rice is cooked and steamed with an indigenous leaf, coconut and a pulse such as black-eyed or kidney beans *Omo Tuo/Rice ball ‚Äì sticky mashed rice is normally eaten with Ghanaian soup. *Plain rice ‚Äì boiled rice accompanies many of the variety of red stews *Jollof rice ‚Äì rice cooked in a stew consisting of stock, tomatoes, spices, and meat boiled together. This dish originated from the Djolof traders from Senegal who settled in the Zongos before the colonial period. Adapted for local Ghanaian tastes, it is typically eaten with goat, lamb, chicken or beef that has been stewed, roasted or grilled. *Fried rice ‚Äì Chinese-style fried rice adapted to Ghanaian tastes. *Angwa moo ‚Äì Also referred to as \\"oiled rice\\". This is unlike fried rice which you cook the rice before frying. Oiled rice is cooked by first onion-frying the oil, then adding water after the onions have browned. This will give the rice a different fragrance. The rice is then cooked in the water-oil mixture, to give the rice an oily feel when ready. It may be cooked with vegetables or minced meat, to add to your taste. It is mostly served with earthenware-ground pepper, with either tinned sardines or fried eggs complementing it. *Ngwo moo (Palm rice) ‚Äì It's an alternative to the oiled rice. Only this is cooked with palm oil, instead of cooking oil. The taste is determined by the type of palm oil used. Foods made with cassava *Kokonte or Abete ‚Äì from dried peeled cassava powder usually served alongside Groundnut Soup, consisting of variety of red meat such as tripe, lamb and smoked cat fish *Fufuo ‚Äì pounded cassava and plantain or pounded yam and plantain, or pounded cocoyam/taro. This side dish is always accompanied with one of the many varieties of Ghanaian soups *Gari ‚Äì made from cassava. Often served with \\"Red Red\\" - fish and black-eyed bean stew or Shito and fish *Atti√©k√© or Akyeke ‚Äì made from cassava and popular among the Ahanta, Nzema and Akan-speaking people of Ivory Coast *Plakali ‚Äì made from cassava and popular among the Ahanta, Nzema and Akan-speaking people of Ivory Coast Foods made with beans A deviation to the starch and stew combination are \\"Red red\\" and \\"tubaani\\". These are primarily based on vegetable protein (beans). \\"Red Red\\" is a popular Ghanaian bean and fish stew served with fried ripe plantain and often accompanied with gari, fish and pulses. It earns its name from the palm oil that tints the bean stew and the bright orange color of the fried ripe plantain. Tubaani is a boiled bean cake, also called moimoi in Nigeria. Foods made with yam *Ampesie ‚Äì boiled yam. It may also be made with plantain, cocoyam, potatoes, yams or cassava. This side dish is traditionally eaten with fish stew containing tomatoes, oil and spices. *Yam fufuo ‚Äì fufuo made with yam instead of cassava or plantain or cocoyam, this soft dough is traditionally eaten with any of the varieties of Ghanaian soup. It is popular in Northern and southeastern Ghana. *Mpotompoto (yam casserole or porridge) - slices of yam cooked with much water and a measurable amount of pepper, onions, tomatoes, salt and preferable seasoning. It is universally eaten in Ghanaian environs but not as often as other dishes. Soups and stews Most Ghanaian side dishes are served with a stew, soup or Mako (a spicy condiment made from raw red and green chilies, onions and tomatoes (pepper sauce). Ghanaian stews and soups are quite sophisticated, with liberal and delicate use of exotic ingredients, a wide variety of flavours, spices and textures. Vegetables such as palm nuts, peanuts, cocoyam leaves, ayoyo, spinach, wild mushroom, okra, garden eggs (eggplant), tomatoes and various types of pulses are the main ingredients in Ghanaian soups and stews and in the case of pulses, may double as the main protein ingredient. Beef, pork, goat, lamb, chicken, smoked turkey, tripe, dried snails, and fried fish are common sources of protein in Ghanaian soups and stews, sometimes mixing different types of meat and occasionally fish into one soup. Soups are served as a main course rather than a starter. It is also common to find smoked meat, fish and seafood in Ghanaian soups and stews. Koobi is dried tilapia that has been salted They include crab, shrimp, periwinkles, octopus, snails, grubs, duck, offal, and pig's trotters. Also oysters. Meat, mushrooms and seafood may be smoked, salted or dried for flavour enhancement and preservation. Salt fish is widely used to flavour fish based stews. Spices such as thyme, garlic, onions, ginger, peppers, curry, basil, nutmeg, sumbala, Tetrapleura tetraptera (prekese) and bay leaf are delicately used to achieve the exotic and spicy flavours that characterizes Ghanaian cuisine. Palm oil, coconut oil, shea butter, palm kernel oil and peanut oil are important Ghanaian oils used for cooking or frying and may sometime not be substituted in certain Ghanaian dishes.

They are now mostly used in few traditional homes, for soap making and by commercial (street food) food vendors as a cheaper substitute to refined cooking oils. Common Ghanaian soups are groundnut soup,BetumiBlog: Search results for peanut butter soup light (tomato) soup, kontomire (taro leaves) soup, Palm Nut Soup,BetumiBlog: Ghanaian Gourmet-Recipe No. 49, continued: Palmnut Soup .

Other vegetable stews are made with kontomire, garden eggs, egusi (pumpkin seeds), spinach, okra, etc. Breakfast meals Most of the dishes mentioned above are served during lunch and supper in modern Ghana. However, those engaged in manual labour and a large number of urban dwellers still eat these foods for breakfast and will usually buy them from the streets. In large Ghanaian cities, working-class people would often take fruit, tea, chocolate drink, oats, rice porridge (locally called rice water) or kooko (fermented maize porridge) and koose/akara or maasa (rice, ripe plantain and maize meal fritters).Kokoking: Food and nutrition . . Retrieved 11 October 2013. Other breakfast foods include grits, tombrown (roasted maize porridge), and millet porridge. Bread is an important feature in Ghanaian breakfast and baked foods. Ghanaian bread, which is known for its good quality, is baked with wheat flour and sometimes cassava flour is added for an improved texture. There are four major types of bread in Ghana. They are tea bread (similar to the baguette), sugar bread (which is a sweet bread), brown (whole wheat) bread, and butter bread. Rye bread, oat bread and malt bread are also quite common.BetumiBlog: Ghana's Tea Bread Secrets . Betumi.com (5 March 2007). Retrieved 30 November 2011. Sweet foods Etor is a popular dish in south Ghana, prepared with plantain and/or with yam boiled and mashed, and mixed with palm oil. Groundnuts (peanuts) and eggs are used to garnish the dish.

Beverages Ghanaian beverages at a convenience store in Ghana In southern Ghana, Ghanaian drinks such as asaana (made from fermented maize) are common. Along the Lake Volta and in southern Ghana, palm wine extracted from the palm tree can be found, but it ferments quickly and then it is used to distil akpeteshie (a local gin). Akpeteshie can be distilled from molasses too. In addition, a beverage can be made from kenkey and refrigerated into what is in Ghana known as iced kenkey. In northern Ghana, bisaab/sorrel, toose and lamujee (a spicy sweetened drink) are common non-alcoholic beverages whereas pitoo (a local beer made of fermented millet) is an alcoholic beverage. In urban areas of Ghana drinks may include fruit juice, cocoa drinks, fresh coconut water, yogurt, ice cream, carbonated drinks, malt drinks and soy milk.Fan Milk Limited .

The concept of an absolute defense is not a rigid one. Statutes frequently use the term merely as a synonym to \\"full\\" or \\"complete\\". It is more often used, however, as a term of art in both criminal and civil law to refer to an underlying set of facts and laws, not raised by the complaint or indictment, which will require the defendant's dismissal even if the factual allegations of the complaining pleading are true. Another characteristic of an absolute defense is that, once it is pleaded and proven, it is not subject to mitigation or collateral attack. Examples of absolute defenses include * Truth of an allegedly libelous statement (in modern defamation): a person cannot be made to pay damages for a defamatory statement, if the person can show that the statement is true (even if the statement is damaging, and the person said it in bad faith). This is the case in some jurisdictions, including the United States, but not in others, including England and Wales and Australia. * Self-defense in a battery case: a person cannot be held criminally liable for battery if they can prove Right of self-defense under certain circumstances (e.g. where retreat was impossible, or where the use of force was not excessive). * Immunity of various kinds can provide an absolute defense. Probably the strongest of these is sovereign immunity‚Äîthis is the common law doctrine, followed in many jurisdictions, that the state cannot be sued unless it agrees to waive its immunity, usually by legislation allowing specific claims to be brought. Use of the word \\"absolute\\" sometimes causes confusion, because even in the law \\"absolute\\" is sometimes used simply as a synonym for \\"full\\" or \\"complete\\". As a term or art, however, there are many complete defenses which are not customarily called absolute. Most notably, innocence, while a complete defense to a criminal charge, is not generally termed \\"absolute\\", because it involves a material fact of the pleading. On the other hand, double jeopardy is more likely to be termed an absolute defense; an indictment or (other criminal initiating pleading) does not have to state that the defendant has not previously been tried on the crime, but once a defendant shows that he has been previously tried for a crime, his dismissal is required by the US Constitution. Both an absolute defense and a complete defense must be distinguished from a partial defense. With a partial defense, the litigant hopes to mitigate the outcome of the litigation, or limit culpability, but the liability is not eliminated. Examples include diminished capacity to understand the wrongfulness of the action, or a mistake of fact that affected the intention of the litigant.

The town of Battal is considered to be the headquarters of the valley. The Silk Route, also known as the Karakoram highway, passes through it leading to Gilgit. Towns, like Battal, and structures in the area, were severely damaged by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. Konsh Valley, located in northwest Mansehra, like many other areas in the district, suffered severe damage. However, it has not received adequate attention compared to the other affected valleys in Mansehra. Konsh Valley has a total area of 23500 hectares. The altitude varies from 1067 meters at Ichhrian to 2911 meters at Bahishti Sar. The valley is inhabited by more than 76,000 people, made up of three main trips: Sayyed, Sawati and Gujars, reside in the area. Union Councils (UCs) are the main units of administration and have elected memberships. Maintenance of law and order and revenue collection are the major functions of the district government. Line agencies are represented at the district level and below. Livelihoods in Konsh are based primarily on livestock, rangelands and forest, and off-farm incomes. An average household keeps one or two buffalos, cows/oxen, some goats and sheep. Livestock provide milk products and animal draft power, and also serve as a form of savings. The fodder shortage is highest between January and April. The average farm is small and income from crop production is secondary to most households. Maize is the predominant crop. Wheat and potatoes are also grown, and some vegetables, where water is not a constraint. Most of the fields are terraced, but cropping on un-terraced slopes is also common, and causes accelerated soil erosion. There is potential for increased production of off season vegetables, fruits and fodder crops. The earthquake has had multiple effects on livelihoods, and subsequent aftershocks, torrential rains, flooding and mudslides compounded the impact. The initial focus on relief and rebuilding rendered all economic activity to a minimum. Men were reluctant to leave their wives and daughters alone in camps while they found work, and migrant casual labourers returned home to assist families. Those who rely on remittances are buffering the impact. In addition, village shopkeepers have not only stopped providing credit, they have also been unable to provide food and non-food items. Poor and very poor households, typically reliant on local shopkeepers, have suffered immensely.

Its discovery in 1963 was first described by J. K. Woo the following year. The cranial capacity is estimated to be , somewhat similar to that of its contemporary, Java Man. Remnants of Lantian Man were found in Lantian County, in China's Shaanxi province, approximately 50 km southeast of Xi'an. Shortly after the discovery of the mandible (jaw bone) of the first Lantian Man at Chenjiawo (), also in Lantian, a cranium (skull) with nasal bones, right maxilla, and three teeth of another specimen of Lantian Man were found at Gongwangling (), another site in Lantian.  Dating  A skull found at Gongwangling is the oldest fossil of a Homo erectus ever found in northern Asia. When first published in 1964, it was dated to 1.15 million years ago, but in 2001, Zhu Zhaoyu (), a geologist at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other scientists began a fresh research of the site. Their new analysis was published in 2015, which has determined that the strata containing the cranium from Gongwangling dates to approximately 1.63 million years ago, much older than the previous estimate of 1.15 million years. This new confirmed date makes the cranium the second oldest site outside of Africa, Dmanisi, Georgia being the oldest. It is older than the Peking Man, but slightly younger than the Yuanmou Man. Zhu's further survey of the region led to the discovery of the Shangchen site in Lantian, which was published in 2018. Stone tools (but no hominin fossils) found at Shangchen are dated to more than 2.1 million years ago, the earliest known evidence of hominins outside Africa, surpassing Dmanisi by 300,000 years.  Tool Complex  Until the 1980s it had been commonly accepted that comparisons between European and Asian Paleolithic cultures were not possible. The common thinking was that there was too great a difference between their tool technologies. In the 1940s a researcher, H.L. Movius, proposed that the Paleolithic West was made up of \\"hand axe cultures\\", while the East had \\"chopper-chopping tool cultures\\". Numerous research into technological traditions followed the model proposed by Movius in support of the East/West technology divide. Twenty-six lithic artifacts were uncovered in the same loess sedimentary deposit as the cranium from the Gongwangling site in Lantian County, China. The artifacts consisted of cores, flakes, choppers, hand-axes, spheroids, and scrapers. Lab analysis suggested that the \\"early hominins chose quartzite, quartz, greywacke and igneous rock pebbles/cobbles on the riverbank for stone knapping, whereas the fine sandstone, siliceous limestone and chert were used only occasionally.\\" Studying the assemblage from Gongwangling along with a series of other sites in the Lantian region leads researchers to believe that the tools utilized by the hominids are more similar to the Acheulean tools utilized in the West than previously thought. This means that the tool technology is not different, and still consists of more large hand tools e.g. hand-axes than previous researchers thought and represents a continuum of technology from the West rather than two separately occurring technologies.

Its etymology is uncertain, but probably derives from Old English swƒ´n \\"pig\\" + either lƒìah \\"open ground\\" or hyll \\"hill\\" + ing, a suffix which in this case marks the word as a place-name + t≈´n \\"estate, farm\\".Victor Watts (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v. \\"SWILLINGTON\\" The Dictionary of British Place Names gives a derivation from \\"farmstead near the pig hill (or clearing).\\"Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p.446. The name was recorded as \\"Svilentone\\" in 1147. Historically Swillington's full title was Swillington-in-Elmet, which refers to the association of the village with the early medieval polity of Elmet. However, as with many other places the \\"-in-Elmet\\" has been lost in modern times with only a few exceptions such as Barwick-in-Elmet and Sherburn-in-Elmet surviving. Nowadays Elmet only exists as a political constituency. Economy Swillington sits at the centre of an agricultural community, and includes Leventhorpe Vineyard and an organic farm. Leventhorpe Vineyard, established in 1986, is near the village, and has been recommended by Rick Stein.Our trends in the north - Telegraph It was until recently the most northerly commercial vineyard in Britain--there is now one further north, near Malton.BBC Inside Out - Weird Weather The Soil Association-certified organic farmSoil Association on the former Lowther estate has been frequented by celebrity chefs, and has produce voted the 'Best Meat In Yorkshire' in 2007.Yorkshire Post Winners Landmarks Swillington sits on the banks of the River Aire, and is adjacent to the RSPB St Aidan's Nature Reserve. The parish church of St Mary is a Grade II* listed building of 14th- or 15th-century origin, with Victorian additions. Leventhorpe Hall, within the parish and to the west of the village, is a Grade II* listed house built in 1774. Transport Swillington does not have a railway station, unlike the nearby town of Garforth, but is served by bus operators. The major roads through the village are Wakefield Road (the A642), Swillington Lane and Astley Lane. Under proposals released on 28 January 2013, Phase 2 of the High Speed 2 rail link would be built close to the western side of the village, running adjacent to the M1 motorway. The HS2 track would cross the existing railway line close to Thorpe Park to the north of the village and also cross Selby road via embankment and bridge. Further south a viaduct would be placed across Wakefield Road. This line would carry the spur away from Leeds, towards the East Coast Main Line at Church Fenton. Education The local school, Swillington Primary School has about 270 pupils. Swillington does not have its own secondary school, consequently pupils typically attend Garforth Academy or Brigshaw High School. YEDL, the local electricity distribution company, has its overhead line school at Swillington where it trains its apprenticed and qualified linesmen in techniques required to work on the electricity network throughout its licence area.  Sport and recreation The village has four local football teams, a bowls team, snooker teams and a rugby league team. They use recreational grounds surviving from the mining days. There is also a shooting and country sports supply business in town, and a number of horse riding stables. Swillington Church also host many groups, including a keen bell ringing team.

Koenigsegg wanted to build a sports car that could exceed the standards set by the McLaren F1 at the time, and achieve speeds over the 386 km/h (240 mph) set by the F1 in 1997. The design of the CC was inspired by the McLaren F1 along with the Ferrari F40. The car, initially painted silver, was then painted black when the new dihedral helix synchro actuation doors were fitted, and finally was painted its current colour. Other two prototypes included the white European spec prototype which was produced in 2000 and the other was a pre-production version of the CC8S. The production version of the CC, the CC8S, was designed in 2002, and was the first car Koenigsegg produced. The deal with Audi for the use of their 4.2 V8 did fall flat after the car's designer, Christian von Koenigsegg, made clear his intent of tuning the V8 far beyond its standard output. The next candidate was the Flat-12 race engine developed by Motori Moderni for the Scuderia Coloni Formula One team, in which this engine was raced under the Subaru badge in the 1990 season. These Subaru 1235 engines were purchased and modified for use in the CC. This deal failed to materialise when the founder of Motori Modern died, sending the company into bankruptcy.

It lies in the Conwy valley, less than a mile south of Trefriw, and a mile north-west of Llanrwst. Today neighbouring Trefriw is a village with a population of nearly 800, but in the time of Llywelyn Fawr (Llywelyn the Great), and up to the early 19th century, Llanrhychwyn was larger than Trefriw, which consisted simply of \\"a few houses here and there\\" (quote from Hanes Trefriw, by Morris Jones). Indeed, even today both Trefriw and Llanrhychwyn lie within the parish of Llanrhychwyn. The adjacent Gwydir Forest would have provided work for many of the inhabitants. A number of metal mines were located in the forest, and the heyday of metal mining here was between 1850 and 1919. The forest also provided wood, and both timber and metal were transported from the forest to the quay at neighbouring Trefriw, from where it was shipped downstream to the coast. Llanrhychwyn takes its name from Rhychwyn (sometimes recorded as Rhochwyn), son of Helig ap Glannog, the prince who lived at Llys Helig before it was inundated by the sea, and now the subject of myth and legend. Rhychwyn had several brothers who established churches and became saints, including Celynin, who established the old church at Llangelynnin, near Henryd, further down the valley.  The church  Llanrhychwyn's main claim to fame is its parish church, which many claim is the oldest in Wales, marking the site where Rhychwyn originally established his church in the 6th century. The church is known locally as Llewelyn‚Äôs Church,Information board at church and the oldest part dates from the late 11th century. Llywelyn Fawr, Prince of Gwynedd and de facto Prince of Wales, had a hunting lodge in Trefriw, close to Llanrhychwyn, known in documents as 'Y Ty Du'.An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Caernarvonshire, a publication of The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire, HMSO, 1964 Llywelyn married Siwan or Joan a daughter of King John of England in 1205. In about 1230 Llywelyn endowed another church for the local community living on the valley bottom in the commotal centre, on the site where St Mary's, Trefriw now stands. Llywelyn and Siwan are portrayed in a remarkable stained glass window in the church, as are Rhychwyn and David in a window dating from 1533. An inscription in Latin asks for prayers for the donors. Set within an ancient churchyard, the church is a good example of early architecture. The east aisle was added in the 13th century, and the north aisle dates from the 16th century. It has a very old square font, as old as the church itself, and an early example of stained glass in the east window. The roof beams, some 800 years old, are the earliest example in Wales. The ancient oak door has wooden hinges, and the bell, which dates from the 13th century, possibly came from Maenan Abbey. The altar rails date from 1616, and the pulpit from 1691. The chalice is dated 1614 and is of an ornate design. The registers date from 1594. These days, services are only held in Llanrhychwyn church during the summer months, and on special occasions. If locked, the key is available from Tu hwnt i'r Gors Farm, nearby. Morris Jones also records in Welsh that this church was \\"built by Llywelyn for [his wife's] use, and for the use of the inhabitants, for their kindness towards him, and that he donated a number of farms from the parish of Llanrhychwyn, naming them as the parish of Tref Rhiw Las. It got this name from the slope on which it stood\\".  Famous inhabitants  The Taliesin monument, overlooking Llyn Geirionydd A popular belief, based on a misinterpretation of a line of poetry in the Red Book of Hergest by 18th- and early 19th-century antiquarian scholars, is that Taliesin (c. 534‚Äìc.599), the 6th-century Welsh bard and the earliest poet of the Welsh language whose work has survived, was an inhabitant of the area, living on the shores of Llyn Geirionydd and buried there. It has even been claimed that he was also born in this area, but it is far more likely that he was born in Powys, as demonstrated by his poems to Cynan Garwyn, King of Powys. Robert Williams (Trebor Mai) (1830‚Äì77) was born near the parish church and grew up in the village. He later moved to Llanrwst and became one of the most famous poets of his day, being particularly admired for his mastery of the englyn. John Roberts (1828‚Äì1904) was a native of neighbouring Trefriw, and he used that name in his job as a printer and bookseller. In Eisteddfodau he would assume the bardic name of Gwilym Cowlyd, and frequently levelled criticism at the Gorsedd for being too Anglicised. In 1865, he founded a separate festival to rival the big National Eisteddfod, and called it Arwest Glan Geirionydd (‚ÄòMusic Festival on the Banks of the River Geirionydd‚Äô), and the meeting point was the Taliesin Memorial by Llyn Geirionydd. Richard Owen Roberts, the father of Gwilym Roberts the storyteller, was born in Llanrhychwyn.  A popular walking area  Today many walkers pass through Llanrhychwyn on their way to or from the Gwydir Forest, a popular area of lakes and forest walks. The lane through Llanrhychwyn continues from Trefriw or Llanrwst (via several gates) to Llyn Geirionydd, one of the most popular lakes in the area. Over the hill (Mynydd Deulyn) from Llyn Geirionydd is Llyn Crafnant, reached only by car from Trefriw, and regarded by many as one of the most beautiful spots in Wales. Most of the tourist traffic passing through Llanrhychwyn is totally unaware of the historical significance of the hamlet, and indeed the road itself does not actually pass the old church. One of the \\"Trefriw Trail\\" walks passes Llanrhychwyn Church.  References  * The Conwy Valley & the lands of history, by K.

Ward, Eddie Hayward, and eventually Frank Y. Whiteley, Jr. and his son David A. Whiteley. He had two main jockeys: Hall of Fame rider Bill Shoemaker and Heliodoro Gustines. Racing career In 1973, Forego was fourth behind Secretariat in a Kentucky Derby that was run in record time (1:59 2/5). Eddie Hayward, assistant trainer to Sherrill Ward, took over when Ward was ill and is officially listed as Forego's trainer in his wins in his final two races of 1973: the Roamer and Discovery Handicaps.Thoroughbred Champions: Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century Retrieved 2011-1-1 During the 1973 season, Forego had 18 starts for 9 wins, 3 seconds and 3 thirds for $188,909 in earnings.National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Retrieved 2011-1-1 Forego started 1974 in Florida with wins in the Donn Handicap, Gulfstream Park Handicap and Widener Handicap.

She has been a National Champion in 800 metres for 14 years. Shiny Abraham Wilson (Shiny Abraham) represented India more than 75 times in international competition. She holds the added distinction of representing Asia in four World Cups, She is also perhaps the only athlete to have taken part in six Asian Track & Field Meets in a row beginning 1985 in Jakarta. During this period she won seven gold, five silver and two bronze medals in the Asian competitions. She collected a total of 18 gold and two silver medals from the seven South Asian Federation (SAF) Meets she has competed.  Early life  Born at Thodupuzha in Idukki district of Kerala on 8 May 1965, Shiny became interested in athletics as a child but developed her skills after joining the sports division in Kottayam. In fact Shiny, PT Usha and M D Valsamma studied at the same sports division in various parts of Kerala and as they grew up, they were coached by the NIS coach P. J. Devesla. Shiny was then trained at G.V. Raja Sports School in Trivandrum before she moved to Alphonsa College in Palai. She is married to Wilson Cherian, who is also an international swimmer and an Arjuna awardee. They have three children: Shilpa, Sandra and Shane. She is currently the Indian team selector and government nominee for selection committee board. Presently working as general manager (South) At FCI Chennai.  Career  Shiny Abraham's athletics career ran alongside that of PT Usha from the time the two of them represented the country in the Asian Games in New Delhi in 1982. Shiny became national champion in the 800 metres a year before the Asian Games in Delhi. After that and until she announced her retirement, she has won the event every time she did the course on the national scene, A veteran of four Olympics and three Asian Games, Shiny has some great moments to cherish, particularly the experience in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, where she became the first woman from India to enter the semi-final of an Olympic event. And more importantly, she was part of the relay squad which set the Asian record there and again when it improved upon that mark during the World Championship in Rome in 1987. Shiny also has some bitter memories, of the day when she cut into the inner lane and was disqualified while very much in front of the field during the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul. She also cherishes the memory of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics when she became the first woman to be the flag bearer for India at the Olympics. Her most memorable competition was the Asian Track & Field Meet at Delhi in 1989, despite being in the family way, she ran the 800;meters to come second behind Sun Sumei of China but Shiny was declared the winner as Sumei tested positive for doping. One of her greatest achievements was that she was running even faster after the birth of her child and she set a new record of 1:59.85 in the 800m race at the 1995 South Asian Federation (SAF) Games in Chennai. '''''''''''' Shiny married swimmer Wilson Cherian in December 1988.

Though judges have immunity from lawsuit, in constitutional democracies judicial misconduct or bad personal behaviour is not completely protected. Depending on the jurisdiction, they may be criminally charged for courtroom behavior unrelated to the decision-making process (for example, by shooting someone and committing a murder unrelated to capital punishment by the state), bad decisions may be reversed by an appeals court, and judges may be removed by other judges on the same or higher court (in the United States, a judicial council), by a recall election, by the next regular election, or following impeachment by a legislature. History Historically, judicial immunity was associated with the English common law idea that \\"the King can do no wrong\\" in the eyes of the courts, because the courts are created by the sovereign (sovereign immunity). Judges, the King's delegates for dispensing justice, accordingly \\"ought not to be drawn into question for any supposed corruption [for this tends] to the slander of the justice of the King\\".Floyd & Barker, 12 Co. Rep. 23, 25, 77 Eng. Rep. 1305, 1307 (Star Chamber 1607). An example of applying judicial immunity: a judge is not liable for a slander or libel suit for statements made about someone during a trial, no matter how corrupt that act was.Royal Aquarium and Summer and Winter Garden Society Ltd v Parkinson [1892] 1 QB 431, Court of Appeal (England and Wales) per Lopes LJ at p 451.Sirros v Moore [1975] QB 118, Court of Appeal (England and Wales) per Ormrod LJ at p 145.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, tribunals are considered judicial in nature and so judicial immunity applies to them at common law. This was accepted by the Employment Appeals Tribunal and subsequently the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in respect of police misconduct hearings constituted under the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 (since superseded by the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2008) in Heath v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2004] EWCA Civ 943. However, in P v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2017] UKSC 65, in which a police officer (an officer of the Crown, but under the Equality Act 2010 treated as an employee in employment discrimination cases) sought review of her dismissal as constituting disability discrimination due to post-traumatic stress disorder, the Supreme Court ruled that the Employment Equality Framework Directive (implemented by the 2010 Act) provided directly applicable rights of access to justice in cases of employment discrimination, which, given the supremacy of EU law, overrode the common law rule of judicial immunity. United States In the United States, judicial immunity is among a handful of forms of absolute immunity, along with prosecutorial immunity, legislative immunity, and witness immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court has characterized judicial immunity as providing \\"the maximum ability [of judges] to deal fearlessly and impartially with the public\\".https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/444/193/case.html The justification is as follows: because of the likelihood of innocent individuals being convicted in a court of law under false claims, the \\"burden\\" of being subjected to a court of law (a trial) would \\"dampen\\" the judges \\"enthusiasm\\" or \\"passion\\".Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 564 (1959) Opponents of judicial immunity argue that this doctrine is not adequately justified.http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato- journal/1987/11/cj7n2-13.pdf For example, judges could be shielded from any personal capacity liability, and still be subject to official capacity liability so that they may be held accountable for their injurious acts ‚Äì thus \\"balancing\\" the \\"evil\\" to better protect the fundamental rights of victims. Judicial immunity does not protect judges from suits stemming from administrative decisions made while off the bench, like hiring and firing decisions. But immunity generally does extend to all judicial decisions in which the judge has proper jurisdiction, even if a decision is made with \\"corrupt or malicious intent\\". In 1997 West Virginia judge Troisi became so irritated with a rude defendant, he stepped down from the bench, took off his robe, and bit the defendant on the nose. He pleaded no contest to state charges but was acquitted of federal charges of violating the defendant's civil rights. He spent five days in jail and was put on probation. Because the immunity is attached to the judicial nature of the acts, not the official title of the officeholder, judicial immunity also applies to administrative hearings, although in some situations, only qualified immunity applies. In determining whether absolute or qualified immunity should be provided, the U.S. Supreme Court has identified the following factors, according to the Shriver Center's Federal Practice Manual for Legal Aid Attorneys: The following cases seem relevant to this issue: Stump v. Sparkman (1978)  One of the leading decisions on judicial immunity is Stump v. Sparkman. In 1971, Judge Harold D. Stump granted a mother's petition to have a tubal ligation performed on her 15-year-old daughter, whom the mother alleged was \\"somewhat retarded\\". The daughter was told that the surgery was to remove her appendix. In 1975 the daughter, going by her then-married name of Linda Sparkman, learned that she had been sterilized. She sued the judge. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the judge could not be sued, because the decision was made in the course of his duties. In that regard, it was irrelevant that the judge's decision may have been contrary to law and morally reprehensible. Harris v. Harvey (1979)  Judges usually, but not always, receive immunity from being sued. One exception where a judge was sued and lost is Harris v. Harvey (1979).605 F.2d 330 (7th Cir. 1979) Sylvester Harris was an African-American police lieutenant in Racine, Wisconsin, attacked in a variety of ways by Judge Richard G. Harvey. Harris sued Harvey because of (a) comments Harvey made to the news media, (b) threatening letters Harvey wrote to city and county officials who attempted to defend Harris, and (c) parties Harvey held for ranking state officials during which he attempted to get Harris removed from law enforcement. The jury concluded that Harvey was not eligible for judicial immunity for these actions, as such acts which were not part of the judge's normal duties (i.e. were \\"outside his jurisdiction\\"). The jury awarded Harris $260,000 damages. Another judge later added $7,500 legal fees. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit concurred with the jury's decision. Judge Harvey petitioned the Seventh Circuit court for an en banc rehearing, which was denied. His petition to the Supreme Court was also denied. Harris v. Harvey is the first case in the United States where a sitting court judge has been sued and lost in a civil action; it is a binding precedent in the Seventh Circuit and is persuasive authority in the other circuits. Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union (1980)  In Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union (1980), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Supreme Court of Virginia did not have immunity in federal court from being enjoined in its enforcement capacity where state law gave the court independent authority to initiate certain proceedings against attorneys.Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, 446 U.S. 719, 719‚Äì720 (1980) Consumers Union was hindered from compiling an attorney directory because many attorneys they contacted declined to provide requested information out of fear of violating, and thereafter prosecuted, attorney conduct regulations promulgated by the Supreme Court of Virginia. Consumers Union filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Supreme Court of Virginia and others, under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, seeking to have the regulation declared unconstitutional and to enjoin the defendants from enforcing it.446 U.S. at 724‚Äì727 The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Supreme Court of Virginia's legislative immunity:446 U.S. at 734‚Äì737 Mireles v. Waco (1991)  In the case of Mireles v. Waco (1991),502 U.S. 9, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 when a defense lawyer failed to appear for a scheduled hearing, the judge not only issued a bench warrant for his arrest, but instructed the police sent to arrest him to \\"rough him up a little\\" to teach him not to skip court dates. Although this was entirely unprofessional and possibly criminal, the judge was held, by the Supreme Court, to have absolute immunity from a lawsuit arising from the resulting beating, because the misbehavior occurred entirely within his activities as a judge presiding over a court.

Belleoram has a large harbour and shelter from the sea, with the protection of a natural breakwater. Belleoram, a fishing community, had a fish plant which closed in 1989. Aquaculture and fishing farm are important economic drivers. Belleoram dates back to 1774. The French used the area and called it \\"Bande de Laurier.\\" By 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht had forced the French to leave. In 1718, Captain Tavenor sailed around the south of Newfoundland and called it \\"Belorme's Place.\\" In the 17th century, a French adventurer wintered there for 20 years, and he was the first to name the community Belleoram. A Dorchester man named Parsons, is said to be the first English settler in Belleoram, followed by another Dorchester man named John Cluett. Other people came from the west of England as servants to the early planters. The Anglican Church in Belleoram, locally known as the \\"Cathedral of the South Coast\\" was built in 1891 and consecrated as St. Lawrence Church in 1901. The Church is representative of Gothic architecture, a style of architecture developed in Western Europe between the 12th and 16th centuries. Visitors can see the John Cluett Heritage House which was built about 1844 and is best described as a \\"saltbox,\\" one of the simplest forms of architecture and common amongst early settlers. The Cluett House, which is over 150 years old, is constructed mainly of original timber.

The clavecin √©lectrique (or clavessin √©lectrique) was a musical instrument invented in 1759 by Jean-Baptiste Thillaie Delaborde, a French Jesuit priest. It is the earliest surviving electric-powered musical instrument, pre-dated only by the Denis d'or, which is only known from written accounts. Delaborde described the instrument in his 1761 publication, Le clavessin √©lectrique. The mechanism was based on a contemporary warning-bell device, and the instrument is essentially an electric carillon. A number of bells, two for each pitch, hang from iron bars along with their clappers (one for each pair). A globe generator charges the prime conductor and the iron bars. The musician presses a key and one of the bells of the corresponding pair is grounded, cut off from the charge source. The clapper then oscillates between the grounded and the charged bells, producing the desired tone. The somewhat inappropriate choice of the instrument's name was defended by Delaborde, who claimed that it was far superior to a carillon. He also mentioned that during a performance in a dark room the listener's \\"eyes are agreeably surprised by the brilliant sparks\\" that were produced by the instrument. The press and the public admired the innovative machine, but it wasn't developed further. The model Delaborde himself built survives and is kept at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris.

They are members of Circovirus that can infect pigs. The viral capsid is icosahedral and approximately 17 nm in diameter. PCVs are the smallest viruses replicating autonomously in eukaryotic cells. They replicate in the nucleus of infected cells, using the host polymerase for genome amplification. PCV-2 causes Porcine circovirus associated disease or postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). An effective vaccination is now available. Fort Dodge Animal Health (Wyeth) launched the first USDA approved vaccine in 2006, containing an inactivated virus (ATCvet code: ).  Classification  Three strains of PCV are known as of 2018: * PCV-1 (first identified in 1974) readily infects, but is not known to cause disease in swine. * PCV-2 (first isolated in 1997) causes PMWS, which over time results in significant depletion of lymphocytes; postmortem examination of diseased animals reveals enlarged lymph nodes and abnormal lung tissue. However, viral infection by itself tends to cause only mild disease, and co-factors such as other infections or immunostimulation seem necessary for development of severe disease. For example, concurrent infection with porcine parvovirus or PRRS virus, or immunostimulation lead to increased replication of PCV-2 and more severe disease in PCV-2-infected pigs. * PCV-3 (first described in 2015) causes a wide range of problems, and may be widespread among pigs. PCV-1 and PCV-2 show a high degree of sequence identity and a similar genomic organisation; nevertheless, the basis of the distinct pathogenicity has not yet been unravelled. The organization for PCV-3 is similar, but the sequence identity is much lower. Genome ‚ÄùMelting Pot‚Äù quadruplet formation PCV's genome is one of the simplest of all viruses, requiring only a capsid protein (ORF2) and two replicase proteins (ORF1) in order to replicate and produce a functional virus. Due to the simplicity of PCV, it must rely heavily on the host's cellular machinery to replicate. The origin of replication is located on a small octanucleotide stem-loop that is flanked by palindromic repeats, with the ORF's being located head-to-head on both sides of the Ori. Specifically, ORF1 is located clockwise and ORF2 is located counterclockwise of the Ori. The two replicase enzymes that are created from ORF1, Rep and Rep', are conserved between the two types of PCV, and are part of the early phase of the virus. The replicases differ in that Rep is the full ORF1 transcript of 312 amino acids, whereas Rep' is a truncated form of ORF1 as a result of splicing and is only 168 amino acids in length. The promoter for rep (Prep) contains an Interferon-Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) that suggests Rep and Rep' are regulated by cytokine involvement, and is probably a means for the virus to overcome the host's immune responses to infection. Rep and Rep' form a dimer that binds to two hexameric regions adjacent to the stem-loop, H1 and H2, which is required for replication. When the dimer binds to this region, the replicases cleave the loop region of the stem-loop and remain covalently bound to the H1 and H2 regions of the DNA, which becomes the 5' end of the DNA. The newly formed 3'OH end forms a primer using host RNA polymerase, which is then used by the host's DNA polymerase to begin transcription of the viral DNA via rolling circle replication. After the complementary DNA strand has been created, the stem region of the stem-loop forms a loose, non-hydrogen bonded, quadruplet DNA structure. This loosely associated structure can form short lived DNA-trimers which forms two templates for replication, as well as maintaining the nucleic integrity of the stem region of the stem-loop. The termination of the replication sequence has not been identified, yet, though there is evidence supporting that Rep also represses its own promoter, Prep. The ORF2 region encodes Cap, which differs slightly between PCV-1 and PCV-2. This variation within PCV may explain why PCV-1 is non-pathogenic, while PCV-2 is pathogenic. The promoter for this protein is located within ORF1, within the site where Rep' is truncated, and is splice from the same exon to the starting point of the ORF2 coding region and expressed during both early and late phases. This is the immunogenic region of the virus and is the primary area of research for creating a vaccine to treat PMWS. There is a third gene encoded in the opposite orientation to ORF1 in the genome. This gene is transcribed and is an essential gene involved in viral replication.He JL, Dai D, Zhou N, Zhou JY (2012) Analysis of Putative ORF3 Gene Within Porcine Circovirus Type 2. Hybridoma (Larchmt) 31(3):180-187  Size  Porcine circovirus is a replicating entity with one of the smallest DNA strands consisting of a simple loop of DNA. The DNA sequence for Porcine circovirus type 2 strain MLP-22 is 1726 base pairs long. Entry PCV infects a wide variety of cell types, including hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, and macrophages. However, until recently, it was unknown exactly how attachment and entry into these cells was achieved. Research has shown that PCV utilizes clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter the cell, though it's stipulated that there may still be other factors that haven't been identified. Once endocytosed, the endosome and lysosome formation causes an acidic pH shift, which allows ATP-driven uncoating of the virus and allows it to escape the endosomes and lysosomes. After the virus escapes the endosomes and lysosomes, it travels to the nucleus through unknown means. Escape Besides ORF1 and ORF2, there is also an ORF3 which is not necessarily required for PCV to survive within the host. Research has shown that the protein coded in ORF3 can modulate the host cell's cell- division cycle and cause cell-mediated, virus-induced apoptosis. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening system of ORF3 against the porcine cDNA library indicated that the ORF3 protein interacts with the porcine pPirh2, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This E3 ubiquitin ligase normally interacts with p53 during the cell division cycle and prevents it from halting the cell division cycle at S-phase. However, ORF3 also interacts with pPirh2 at the same region as p53 and causes an upregulation of p53 expression. This increase in p53 stops the cell division cycle and the result of this is p53 mediated apoptosis, which releases PCV into the extracellular environment.  Contamination in human vaccine  On March 22, 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended suspending the use Rotarix, one of two vaccines licensed in the United States against rotavirus, due to findings of viral DNA contamination.\\"Components of Extraneous Virus Detected in Rotarix Vaccine; No Known Safety Risk\\", U.S. Food and Drug Administration, March 22, 2010 Follow- up work by GlaxoSmithKline confirmed the contamination in working cells and the viral \\"seed\\" used in Rotarix production, also confirming the material was likely present since the early stages of product development, including the clinical trials for FDA approval.\\"Detection of DNA from PCV1 in Rotarix\\", FDA Testing of the other licensed vaccine against rotavirus infection, RotaTeq, also detected some components of both PCV-1 and PCV-2.\\"DNA of Pig Viruses Found in Merck Vaccine\\", The Wall Street Journal, May 7, 2010 Porcine circovirus 1 is not known to cause disease in humans or other animals. As of June 8, 2010, the FDA has, based on a careful review of a variety of scientific information, determined it is appropriate for clinicians and public health professionals in the United States to use both Rotarix and RotaTeq vaccine.

The ecoregion lies mostly in Madhya Pradesh state, but extends into portions of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh states. Setting The Narmada Valley dry deciduous forests cover an area of of the lower Narmada River Valley and the surrounding uplands of the Vindhya Range to the north and the western end of the Satpura Range to the south. The Narmada Valley is an east-west flat-bottomed valley, or graben, that separates the two plateaus. The Vindhya Range separates the valley from the Malwa plateau and Bundelkhand upland to the north. The Satpura Range reaches a height of 1,300m and encloses the valley on the south separating it from the Deccan plateau. The ecoregion includes the western portion of the Satpuras, and also extends to the southeast along the eastern flank of the Western Ghats' range. The uplands of this ecoregion are the northern limits of the Indian peninsula. Rainfall in the ecoregion is highly seasonal; a seven- to eight-month dry season is followed by the June-to-September southwest monsoon, which brings 1,200-1,500 mm of rainfall in an average year. Many trees lose their leaves during the long dry season to conserve moisture. The ecoregion lies between moister forests to the northeast, southeast, and southwest, which receive greater rainfall from the southeast monsoon, and the drier forests and scrublands of the Deccan to the south and Malwa and Gujarat to the west and northwest. The lowland Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests lie to the northeast, on the alluvial plain of the Ganges River and its tributaries below the eastern Vindhyas and the Bundelkhand upland. The Chota-Nagpur dry deciduous forests lie on the Chota Nagpur plateau to the east. The Eastern highlands moist deciduous forests, which receive more annual moisture from the Bay of Bengal, lie to the southeast. To the southwest, along the spine of the Western Ghats range, lie the wetter North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, which receive more moisture from the southwest monsoon winds off the Arabian Sea. To the south, the Deccan Plateau of Maharashtra lies in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats, and is home to the Central Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests of Vidarbha and the drier Deccan thorn scrub forests of Kandesh. The Kathiarbar-Gir dry deciduous forests cover most of Malwa to the northwest and the lowlands of Gujarat to the west. Flora The natural vegetation of the region is a three-tiered forest adapted to the monsoon and dry season climate. The forests typically have an upper canopy at 15‚Äì25 meters, a 10-15 meter understory of smaller trees and large shrubs, and a 3-4 meter undergrowth. Teak (Tectona grandis) is the dominant canopy tree, in association with coromandel ebony (Diospyros melanoxylon), dhaora (Anogeissus latifolia), Lagerstroemia parviflora, Terminalia tomentosa, Lannea coromandelica, Hardwickia binata, and Boswellia serrata. Riparian areas along the regions rivers and streams, which receive year-round water, are home to moist evergreen forests, whose dominant tree species are Terminalia arjuna, Syzygium cumini, Syzygium heyneanum, Salix tetrasperma, Homonoia riparia, and Vitex negundo. Fauna The ecoregion is home to 76 species of mammals, none of which are endemic, although several of which, including the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), along with gaur (Bos gaurus), packs of dhole or Asiatic wild dog (Cuon alpinus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), chousingha (Tetracerus quadricornis), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), are threatened. The ecoregion is home to 276 bird species, none of which are endemic. Large threatened birds include the lesser florican (Eupodotis indica) and Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps). Conservation This area is densely populated and only about 30% of the ecoregion is covered in relatively intact vegetation, but this does include some large blocks of habitat in the amarkantak, Vindhya and Satpura ranges which are important for the preservation of the tiger.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment.

Design Machinery The ship is powered by four GMT Sulzer 16 ZAV and two GMT Sulzer 12 ZAV diesel-electric engines driving two controllable pitch propellers. She is fitted with two rudders (which can be individually controlled) as well as stabilizers. Layout Carnival Victory is themed by American designer and architect Joseph Farcus to depict the different oceans and seas of the world. Like Carnival Sunrise (formerly Carnival Triumph), her architecture is different from sister ship Carnival Destiny (now Carnival Sunshine). The two newer vessels have additional balcony cabins on their Lido decks and various changes to placement and architecture of public areas. There are three large pools and a waterslide. She has a nine-deck atrium with four glass elevators, a three-deck lounge with seating for 1,500, and a total capacity of 3,400 passengers and 1,000 crew members. On 16 October 2018, Carnival Cruise Line announced that the ship will enter drydock on 18 March 2020 in Cadiz, Spain. She left for Cadiz on 4 March 2020 after her final voyage as Carnival Victory. She is planned to leave drydock on 26 April 2020 after receiving a $200 million refurbishment and will be renamed to Carnival Radiance. Operation Throughout her service, Carnival Victory has been based in Miami in the United States sailing year-round on alternating three- and four-night cruises to Caribbean destinations. On 23 July 2020, Carnival announced that Carnival Radiance's new homeport will be Long Beach, California instead of Port Canaveral, Florida as previously announced in 2018.

Showbiz Tonight was hosted by A.J. Hammer at CNN New York at the time of its cancellation. The show reported and debated celebrity entertainment news stories and controversies, along with social networking segments involving viewer interaction via social networks and the program's call-in toll free number. The program aired Monday through Thursday nights at 11 p.m. Eastern, with encore presentations on Tuesday through Saturday mornings at 2 a.m. and 4:10 a.m. Eastern. Showbiz Tonight is also shown several times daily in Europe on Star! Scandinavia, a channel operated by Turner NonStop Television, part of Turner Broadcasting. On February 3, 2014, HLN canceled Showbiz Tonight, with the final episode airing February 6. Hammer continues to be involved in the network to cover entertainment stories. History Hosted by A.J. Hammer in New York City, the program was also hosted by Karyn Bryant when it began airing on February 20, 2005. During the duration of the program, hosting changed with Bryant leaving the show at the end of 2005 and Hammer took on primary hosting duties with correspondents filling in as co-hosts. Brooke Anderson became an official co-host in 2009. The live telecast moved from 11 p.m. ET to 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. PT) on March 29, 2010, but moved back to 11 p.m. ET in early May 2011, with the first-run broadcast now airing taped, recorded hours in advance of its initial airtime; meanwhile, the 5 p.m. airing was dropped and replaced with HLN Special Report With Vinnie Politan.

Showbiz Tonight used a dual-coast format with Hammer based in New York and Anderson in Los Angeles. On April 13, 2011, it was announced that Anderson would leave the program to join the syndicated entertainment program The Insider in May; with Anderson's departure, Showbiz Tonight dropped its Los Angeles-based anchor segments and was recorded solely in New York from that point on. However, story packages that included discussions between the host and celebrity panelists continued to originate from both cities, with segments originating from Los Angeles done via satellite.

The authors argue that information technology needs to be considered in a broad context that includes the entirety of society and social resources, in contrast to the narrow focus on information that tends to be the framework of such technology - what the authors criticize as \\"tunnel design\\".Seely Brown, John; Duguid, Paul (2017/2000). The Social Life of Information. Updated edition. Boston, Mass.: Harvard Business Review Press. . pp. 4-9 (\\"Introduction to the Original Edition\\"). That is, increased technological delivery of information does not in and of itself contribute to a better future. The text, in part, analyzes examples of the office world's adoption of technology, offering a differentiated rather than an unquestioningly affirmative view of the effects.  User agents  Serving as an early example of the ambiguous utility of software to human, the authors discuss software known as autonomous agents which manipulate information. Different forms of such agents include information broker, product brokering, merchant brokering, and negotiation. The authors use an example of information brokering using the Macintosh program named Sherlock that searched for the word \\"knobot\\" via the Internet. Product brokering would be an example of an online bookstore sending a person an email about a book for sale based on the previous types of books the customer bought. Merchant brokering, now widely practiced, consists of finding the best price for a product. For example, eBay allows users, not necessarily in the same location, to buy new, used, or refurbished products through an auction, at a fixed price, or through negotiation. This book has been republished in 2002 with a new introduction, by the Harvard Business School Press.  Reviews  Reviews of the book from professional journals include: *Gleason, Sandra (Summer 2001).

He won the gold medal in the 4 √ó 5 km team event and a bronze medal in the 15 km Gundersen race at the 2007 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Sapporo. After winning a Ski Jumping World Cup competition in Innsbruck on 4 January 2014, Koivuranta became the first ever athlete in history of ski jumping to win an event in both Nordic combined and the ski jumping World Cup. Koivuranta in 2011 Nordic combined career (2003-2010) World Cup breakthrough In December the same year, in early 2004/05 season, he finished among the top ten for the first time, with an eighth place in the sprint race in Trondheim. His first podium achievement came in January 2005, with a third place in Sapporo. Almost one month later, he finished sixth in the sprint distance at the 2005 World Championships. Before the season was over, he would win a bronze medal at the Junior World Championships in Rovaniemi. Period 2005‚Äì2008 The 2005/06 season saw Koivuranta open with a second place, in Kuusamo in November. During the course of the season he achieved another second place as well as two third places. He also earned a bronze medal in the 4 x 5 team event at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. In December 2006 he achieved two second places in a row, and followed with consistent achievements among the top fifteen. At the 2007 World Championships in Sapporo he won the gold medal in the 4 x 5 km team event, a bronze medal in the 15 km Gundersen race and finished fourth in the sprint. At his last Junior World Championships, held in Tarvisio in March 2007, he won a gold and a silver medal. The same level of performance continued in the 2007‚Äì08 season, placing him twice on the podium. World Cup winner 2008/09 Having been among the better ski jumpers in the Nordic combined sport since 2004, Koivuranta struggled somewhat in the cross-country skiing part. Concentrating on improving his cross-country skiing abilities, from 2005 he managed to improve little by little. He owed his increased share of podium achievements to this training. By 2008/09 season Koivuranta had become one of the better cross-country skiers as well, in part thanks to a newly appointed coach to the Finnish national team. Koivuranta won his first World Cup race in November 2008 in Kuusamo. He followed up with victories in Trondheim and Oberhof in December, and Schonach and Chaux Neuve in January.2008‚Äì09 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup overall standings ‚Äì FIS-Ski The World Championships in Liberec 2009, was not successful for Koivuranta as he did not win any medals at all, and his best results were two fourth places . Koivuranta was also sick during the World Championships which affected his results and that he was unable to compete in the team competition. On 14 March Koivuranta won the Gundersen event at Vickersund, the penultimate race of the season. The following day he finished 8th in the 2nd Gundersen of the weekend. This was high enough for him to clinch the 2008‚Äì09 FIS Nordic Combined World Cup, his first world cup title, finishing 100 points above the man in second place, Magnus Moan. Planica 2009 Koivuranta's personal best ski jump is 214,5 metres as trial jumper in Planica. It was in the second training round that he jumped 214,5 and was in second place. It is worth mentioning that the best jumper jumped with lower speed. Season 2009/10 Koivuranta's best placement for the 2009‚Äì10 season was a 2nd place. The season as a whole was a disappointment for Anssi who struggled with persistent sickness throughout the winter and as a result, failed to match the successes of his previous championship year. In January 2010 he had a problem with a tooth injury. At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Koivuranta finished seventh in the 4 x 5 km team and eighth in the 10 km individual normal hill. He competed in the 10 km individual large hill event, but withdrew prior to the start of the cross-country section of that event, following a poor result in the ski jumping section in difficult conditions. This would also prove to be Koivuranta's final season in Nordic Combined before his transition to ski jumping.

In 2009 Koivuranta had won the Finnish ski jumping championship, ahead of the national team ski jumpers. In March 2009 he jumped 214.5 metres in Planica ski flying hill. In 2010 Koivuranta suffered Mycoplasma pneumonia. The disease prevented him from doing any physical endurance practice which resulted in his decision to fully concentrate on ski jumping. He got the right to compete in the Ski jumping World Cup by placing 15th and 3rd in the Summer Continental Cup competitions in October. The main goal for Koivuranta for the season 2010/11 was to get himself to the Finnish ski jumping team. Pekka Niemel√§, the head coach of the national team, said that Koivuranta was already very close to the national team level. April 5, 2011 Koivuranta said that he would continue with ski jumping instead of Nordic combined. In 2011‚Äì12 season, he finished fourth in Lahti, improving his personal best World Cup result. On January 4, 2014, Koivuranta took his first Ski Jumping World Cup victory in Innsbruck, thus making history and becoming the first athlete ever to win in both Nordic Combined and Ski Jumping World Cups. After placing 10th at Wisla and getting a further 9th place at Zakopane, Koivuranta gained praise from Finland's head coach Pekka Niemel√§: \\"Koivuranta has started to stabilize his spot in the top ten. When you can (consistently) jump at such a high level, you will also start to get days when everything goes right getting you on top of the podium\\" Hill Records *Kanzlersgrund, the K-120 hill in Oberhof, with 147 metres.Kanzlersgrund at the Ski Jumping Hill ArchiveVideo of Koivuranta's 147 m jump in Oberhof *Vikersund K-105 which is 122,5 metres is also held by Koivuranta. *Non- official record in Liberec K90 with 106,5 metres. *At 148,5 metres he has also jumped the furthest in the Vogtlandarena in Klingenthal, but he fell just after landing as the pressure on his legs was too high.

Koivuranta made his international debut in the B World Cup in March 2003. He competed in the World Cup for the first time in Kuusamo 2003, but was disqualified from both races because his skis were too long compared to his length and weight (BMI rule). In February 2004 he won a bronze medal at the Junior World Championships in Stryn. In March 2004, at the very end of the 2003‚Äì04 season, Koivuranta made his proper debut in the World Cup circuit‚Äîin two races in Lahti, he finished 24th and 23rd respectively.

Built by Fincantieri at its Monfalcone shipyard in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, northern Italy, she was floated out on March 27, 2004, and christened by American journalist Katie Couric in Miami on December 17, 2004. Carnival Cruise Line announced the suspension of all North American itineraries until June 26, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. History Carnival Valor docked in Grand Cayman. The 952-foot ship can hold up to 1,200 crew members and just over 3,750 guests despite normal guests capacity is 3,000. The vessel is homeported in New Orleans, Louisiana, and has a \\"Heroes and Heroics\\" theme. Carnival Valor sails 4 and 5-night cruises to Cozumel, Mexico. Some of Carnival Valor's public areas were refurbished during a drydocking from April 23 through May 8, 2016. In 2017, the ship earned a perfect health score of 100 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was part of the agency's Vessel Sanitation Program, whose purpose is to prevent the transmission and spread of gastrointestinal disease. Crewmember Genti Jankula broke his back onboard Carnival Valor in 2014. In September 2018, a Monaco judge ruled that Carnival should pay him $1.4 million, but the company refused to pay. He then took the company to a U.S. Federal court in Miami before Judge Ursula Ungaro, who ruled in his favor; Jankula won the suit. On February 13, 2020, a rock music-themed cruise, known as ShipRocked, took place onboard Carnival Valor. Performers included Lzzy Hale and her band Halestorm, Alter Bridge, and Beartooth. Port calls On September 4, 2018, due to heavy rains and floods on Galveston, Texas, Carnival Valor's departure was delayed. On January 23, 2019, the ship lost power at sea for an hour when she left Galveston on her way to Cozumel. On May 10, 2019, the ship repositioned and switched homeports with Carnival Dream to begin short sailings. On July 11, 2019, the ship docked in Mobile, Alabama instead of New Orleans due to a tropical storm. On April 3, 2020, the ship along with other three cruise ships departed from the port of Gulfport, Mississippi after Governor Tate Reeves announced a ‚Äúshelter-in-place‚Äù order to contain the spread of coronavirus. Incidents On August 3, 2017, the ship contacted the Houston-Galveston Coast Guard station and requested assistance for a woman who was injured from a fall. She was then medically evacuated by helicopter near Galveston after the ship left port for Cozumel. On October 10, 2019, a 23-year-old male passenger was critically injured when he fell from where he was sitting onto a lower deck. He was medically transported by a Coast Guard Eurocopter MH-65 Dolphin from New Orleans.  Coronavirus pandemic  During the coronavirus pandemic, the CDC reported, as early as April 22, 2020, that at least one person who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had tested positive within 14 days after disembarking. On March 15, a 49-year- old man from Ohio tested positive of the COVID-19 after he started displaying symptoms. On April 8, 300 crew members who tested negative for COVID-19 disembarked at the port of New Orleans.

The college used a relational approach to discipline in order to facilitate a spirit of growth and restoration whenever possible. Academics CCC was known as a Christ- centered liberal arts college with a general education curriculum in the arts and sciences plus an embedded Bible minor for all students. The most popular majors were business, elementary education, and general studies, but there was increasing demand for the programs in the division of science: biology, pre- med, exercise and sport science, psychology, and mathematics. Education majors earned Florida state certification. The interdisciplinary studies major was available for students who wished to focus on two academic disciplines without having to assume the coursework of a double major. Clearwater Christian College had an agreement with the nearby University of South Florida (USF) to offer its students ROTC programs in Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. Study abroad Clearwater encouraged its students to participate in study abroad and missions trips. In the final years of operation, the college offered study abroad trips for college credit during spring break and summer break to Austria, Costa Rica, England, France, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. As a faith-based institution committed to serving God, CCC sponsored missions trips to international locations. Faculty, staff, and students ministered across the globe in Argentina, Brazil, China, Jamaica, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, Turkey, and Thailand. Beliefs Clearwater Christian College was a denominationally unaffiliated Christian college; however most of their faculty, staff, and students came from various Baptist and independent Bible church backgrounds. The college's doctrinal statement focused on the historic fundamentals of Protestant Christianity. Students were required to attend Sunday services, chapel services, and spend time in Christian service. Small group, student-led devotional times occurred twice a week for prayer and peer edification, for all resident students. History In July 1965, Arthur E. Steele went to Florida looking for a place to found a Christian college, as a reaction to what the founders saw as trends in evangelical colleges away from biblical standards of morality. The school would emphasize doctrine and personal soul-winning, and was a reaction against the ecumenical movement, new evangelicalism, and ecumenical evangelism. Evangelist Jack Murray supported the founding as chairman of the Advisory Council. These two founders were both graduates of Faith Theological Seminary, and had each served as a president of Shelton College. Steele found Clearwater, Florida to be an ideal place to found a college. He soon acquired waterfront at the eastern entrance of Clearwater. On September 17, 1966, the college officially opened with 15 students enrolled. Clearwater Christian College received full accreditation from the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS-COC) in December 1984 and in 1998 gained reaffirmation for SACS-COC accreditation. In January 1987, the Board of Directors named George D. Youstra to succeed Steele as president. In the following years, enrollment tripled, new buildings were added, 89 additional acres of property were acquired, and new programs were offered. In May 2002, Richard A. Stratton assumed the presidency. In the summer 2008, the College began its first graduate program in the area of Educational Leadership, and the Florida Department of Education granted full approval for Elementary Education graduates to be certified with a reading endorsement. On May 7, 2012, John F. Klem became the fifth president of Clearwater Christian College. However, the economic downturn across America caused student enrollment to drop significantly. On June 5, 2015, the board of directors of the College announced the closure of Clearwater Christian College effective immediately, citing \\"ongoing struggles with maintaining enrollment, rising costs, and challenging development efforts\\" as reasons for the decision. Accreditation and memberships Clearwater Christian College was accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Master of Education degrees. CCC had been given Teacher Education Program Approval by the Florida Department of Education.

Forqu√© won the Goya Award for Best Actress, the second female lead on an Almod√≥var film to do so. Plot Kika (Ver√≥nica Forqu√©), a na√Øve make-up artist, recalls how she met her lover Ram√≥n (√Ålex Casanovas). She had given her phone number to his step-father, American writer Nicholas Pierce (Peter Coyote), and he had called her not for sex as she had hoped but to make up the younger man's corpse. He was however merely catatonic and suddenly awoke. Ram√≥n is a fashion photographer with voyeuristic tendencies who was traumatised by his mother's suicide after several attempts. He lets Nicholas, who has returned to Madrid, live above their flat and the two discuss whether to sell the family home outside of town, Casa Youkali, which they jointly own. Ram√≥n proposes to Kika, who accepts but feels conflicted as she has been cheating on him with Nicholas. Nicholas is working on a novel about a lesbian serial killer, but he makes ends meet by freelancing discreetly for an outrageously exploitative television show which focuses on bizarre and macabre events. The show is devised and presented by Andrea Caracortada (\\"Andrea Scarface\\", played by Victoria Abril), who wears over-the-top outfits and a persona to match. Andrea used to be a psychologist, and Ram√≥n was once her patient, then her lover. He tells Nicholas that she scarred her own face when he left her and she is now stalking him. On her show, Andrea reports that Paul Bazzo, a dim-witted sex maniac and former pornographic actor jailed for rapes has escaped while attending a religious procession. He turns up at Ram√≥n and Kika's flat because their maid Juana (Rossy de Palma) is his long-suffering sister. Juana instructs him to tie her up, knock her unconscious and steal valuables, then hide at a cousin's place. Paul however finds Kika napping and rapes her at knife point. An unseen voyeur peeping at Kika's room notifies the police and two incompetent inspectors eventually turn up, shoot up the door and with great difficulty interrupt the rape. Paul escapes and bumps into Andrea, kitted out in a futuristic reporter's outfit complete with helmet-mounted video camera. She wants an interview but he pushes her off and steals her motorcycle. She then enters the flat and harasses Kika. The police are puzzled at her presence, because although they often tip her off, they did not in this case. Andrea credits an unknown peeping tom for alerting her and broadcasts video footage of the rape on her show, causing Kika to break down. In the aftermath, Kika finds Ram√≥n to be no help and she overhears him confess to Nicholas that it was he who called the police: he liked to peep on her from his photographic studio's window. She leaves him in silence, as does a guilt-wracked Juana who confesses her part in the rape. Ram√≥n meanwhile also tells Nicholas that he has held on to his mother's diaries but never found the strength to read them. He does so however, after Nicholas has moved back to Casa Youkali, and discovers that the farewell letter to him that Nicholas had passed on was actually ripped from an old entry. Ram√≥n confronts Nicholas and accuses him of murdering his mother. Meanwhile, it turns out that Andrea and Ram√≥n both spied on the flat from separate addresses. While reviewing footage of the upper floor, Andrea realises that Nicholas appears to have murdered one of his several girlfriends, Susana (Bib√≠ Andersen) when she visited him. Connecting this to his latest book, she also goes to Casa Youkali armed with a pistol and finds a freshly dug grave in the garden. Nicholas barricades himself but she breaks in aggressively and offers to interview him and let him run away before the broadcast. They fight and shoot each other. Kika also turns up and Nicholas confesses with his dying breath that his novel about a lesbian serial killer is really a disguised autobiography, as Andrea had worked out. Kika also finds the bodies of Andrea, Susana and Ram√≥n, but she is able to resurrect the latter a second time with electric shocks. Ram√≥n had gone into shock after finding Susana's body in the bathroom. While Ram√≥n is taken to hospital, Kika picks up a stranded motorist and takes an instant interest in him, stating that she might need a new direction.

The name \\"Golden Triangle\\"‚Äîcoined by the CIA‚Äîis commonly used more broadly to refer to an area of approximately that overlaps the mountains of the three adjacent countries. Along with Afghanistan in the Golden Crescent, it has been one of the largest opium-producing areas of the world since the 1950s. Most of the world's heroin came from the Golden Triangle until the early 21st century when Afghanistan became the world's largest producer.\\"Afghanistan Again Tops List of Illegal Drug Producers\\". The Washington Times. 12 March 2013. Origin As the Chinese Communist Party gained power, they ordered ten million addicts into compulsory treatment, had dealers executed, and opium-producing regions planted with new crops. Consequently, opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the Golden Triangle region. The US-supported anti-communist Chinese resistance troops of the Kuomintang in Burma were, in effect, the forebears of the private narcotic armies operating in the \\"Golden Triangle.\\" Almost all the KMT opium was sent south to Thailand. Prior to the arrival of the KMT, the opium trade had already developed as a local opium economy under British colonial rule. The KMT-controlled territories made up Burma's major opium-producing region, and the shift in KMT policy allowed them to expand their control over the region's opium trade. Furthermore, Communist China's forced eradication of illicit opium cultivation in Yunnan by the early 1950s effectively handed the opium monopoly to the KMT army in the Shan states. The main consumers of the drug were the local ethnic Chinese and those across the border in Yunnan and the rest of Southeast Asia. The KMT coerced the local villagers for recruits, food and money, and exacted a heavy tax on the opium farmers. This forced the farmers to increase their production to make ends meet. One American missionary to the Lahu tribesmen of Kengtung State even testifies that the KMT tortured the Lahu for failing to comply with their regulations. Annual production increased twenty-fold, from 30 tons at the time of Burmese independence to 600 tons in the mid-1950s.Lintner, Bertil (1992). Heroin and Highland Insurgency in the Golden Triangle.

Embassy of the Union of Myanmar in Pretoria. 23 October 2005. The surrender of drug warlord Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army in January 1996 was hailed by Yangon as a major counter-narcotics success. Lack of government will and ability to take on major narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against money laundering continues to hinder the overall anti-drug effort. Most of the tribespeople growing the opium poppy in Myanmar and in the Thai highlands are living below the poverty line. In 1996, the United States Embassy in Rangoon released a \\"Country Commercial Guide\\", which states \\"Exports of opiates alone appear to be worth about as much as all legal exports.\\" It goes on to say that investments in infrastructure and hotels are coming from major opiate-growing and opiate- exporting organizations and from those with close ties to these organizations. A four-year investigation concluded that Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) was \\"the main channel for laundering the revenues of heroin produced and exported under the control of the Myanmar Army.\\" In a business deal signed with the French oil giant Total in 1992, and later joined by Unocal, MOGE received a payment of $15 million. \\"Despite the fact that MOGE has no assets besides the limited installments of its foreign partners and makes no profit, and that the Myanmar state never had the capacity to allocate any currency credit to MOGE, the Singapore bank accounts of this company have seen the transfer of hundreds of millions of US dollars,\\" reports Fran√ßois Casanier. According to a confidential MOGE file reviewed by the investigators, funds exceeding $60 million and originating from Myanmar's most renowned drug lord, Khun Sa, were channeled through the company. \\"Drug money is irrigating every economic activity in Myanmar, and big foreign partners are also seen by the SLORC as big shields for money laundering.\\" Banks in Rangoon offered money laundering for a 40% commission. The main player in the country's drug market is the United Wa State Army, ethnic fighters who control areas along the country's eastern border with Thailand, part of the infamous Golden Triangle. The UWSA, an ally of Myanmar's ruling military junta, was once the militant arm of the Beijing-backed Burmese Communist Party. Poppy cultivation in the country decreased more than 80 percent from 1998 to 2006 following an eradication campaign in the Golden Triangle. Officials with the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime say opium poppy farming is now expanding. The number of hectares used to grow the crops increased 29% in 2007. A United Nations report cites corruption, poverty and a lack of government control as causes for the jump. Harvested poppy capsules. Opium and heroin base produced in northeastern Myanmar are transported by horse and donkey caravans to refineries along the Thailand‚ÄìBurma border for conversion to heroin and heroin base. Most of the finished products are shipped across the border into various towns in North Thailand and down to Bangkok for further distribution to international markets. In the past major Thai Chinese and Burmese Chinese traffickers in Bangkok have controlled much of the foreign sales and movement of Southeast Asian heroin from Thailand, but a combination of law enforcement pressure, publicity and a regional drought has significantly reduced their role. As a consequence, many less-predominant traffickers in Bangkok and other parts of Thailand now control smaller quantities of the heroin going to international markets. Heroin from Southeast Asia is most frequently brought to the United States by couriers, typically Thai and U.S. nationals, travelling on commercial airlines. California and Hawaii are the primary U.S. entry points for Golden Triangle heroin, but small percentages of the drug are trafficked into New York City and Washington, D.C. While Southeast Asian groups have had success in trafficking heroin to the United States, they initially had difficulty arranging street level distribution. However, with the incarceration of Asian traffickers in American prisons during the 1970s, contacts between Asian and American prisoners developed. These contacts have allowed Southeast Asian traffickers access to gangs and organizations distributing heroin at the retail level. The Golden Triangle is now one of the world's leading producers of methamphetamine as production has shifted to Yaba and crystalline methamphetamine, including for export to Australia, New Zealand, and across East and Southeast Asia. With respect to the accelerating synthetic drug production in the region, and specifically in Shan State, Myanmar, Sam Gor, also known as The Company, is understood to be the main international crime syndicate responsible for this shift. Made up of members of five different triads and understood to be headed by Tse Chi Lop, a gangster born in Guangzhou, China, the Cantonese Chinese syndicate is primarily involved in drug trafficking, potentially earning up to $8 billion per year. Sam Gor is alleged to control 40% of the Asia-Pacific methamphetamine market, while also trafficking heroin and ketamine. The organization is active in a variety of countries in addition to Myanmar, including Thailand, Lao PDR, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, China and Taiwan. The Chinese Muslim Panthay are the same ethnic group as the Muslims among the Chinese Chin Haw.Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). Traders of the Golden Triangle. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B006GMID5K Both are descendants of Chinese Hui Muslim immigrants from Yunnan province in China. They often work with each other in the Golden Triangle Drug Trade. Both Chinese Muslim and non-Muslim Jeen Haw and Panthay are known to be members of Triad secret societies, working with other Chinese groups in Thailand like the TeoChiew and Hakka and the 14K Triad. They engaged in the heroin trade. Ma Hseuh-fu, from Yunnan province, was one of the most prominent Jeen Haw heroin drug lords. A Panthay from Burma, Ma Zhengwen, assisted the Han Chinese drug lord Khun Sa in selling his heroin in north Thailand. The Panthay monopolized opium trafficking in Burma. They also created secret drug routes to reach the international market with contacts to smuggle drugs from Burma via south China.

It is the sixth novel with the mysterious Albert Campion, aided by his policeman friend Stanislaus Oates. Plot introduction At the former home of John Lafcadio, the great painter dead some 18 years, the annual ceremony to unveil a painting he left behind to keep his memory alive is interrupted by a murder. Suspicion falls on a family member, but with no proof the police are baffled. When murder once again visits \\"Little Venice\\", Albert Campion must exercise all his powers to bring the killer to justice... Plot summary John Lafcadio, who modestly described himself as \\"probably the greatest painter since Rembrandt\\", has left a bizarre legacy ‚Äì a collection of twelve sealed paintings, to be unveiled one at a time at an annual event commencing ten years after his death. While the first seven ceremonies went smoothly, the eighth starts with family ructions, when John's granddaughter Linda finds her boyfriend Tommy has returned from a painting trip to Rome with a model, whom he has married to get into the country. Albert Campion, a friend of Belle and the family, persuades her to attend the show, just in time to be there when Tommy is stabbed to death during a power cut. Campion calls in his old friend Stanislaus Oates to help avoid scandal, but Oates is convinced Linda must be guilty, as she has the only obvious motive. Max Fustian, a hanger-on to Lafcadio's coat-tails and now a flourishing art dealer, confesses to the crime, but his confession is laughable and a clear attempt to clear Linda. No further proof can be found however, and thanks to pressure from some important dignitaries attending the show, the matter is hushed up. The mystery continues, however, as Tommy's art and possessions slowly vanish, until no trace of him remains. Campion meets up with Max Fustian, and finds himself entertaining strange suspicions of the odd little man. Some weeks later, Belle visits Claire Potter in her studio in the garden and finds her dead, face down on the couch. Nicotine poisoning is diagnosed, and suspicion falls at first on her husband, who had skipped work that day and had returned home for a minute an hour before the body was discovered, only to leave again in a hurry. Potter reveals his wife suffered from alcoholism, and frequently drank herself unconscious; he had assumed she had done this once more, washed her glass and left her there. Seeking the source of the poisoned booze, Campion and Oates discover that Claire took in wood-blocks for cleaning from Max Fustian, and had returned a parcel that very day. Questioning the delivery boy, they find that he once dropped a similar package, and was surprised to find the wrapping wet. Convinced of Fustian's guilt but lacking proof, Campion seeks a motive. He learns from the model Rosa-Rosa that Tommy had a cottage in the country, and from the cook Lisa that Lafcadio, despite his determination to defeat his rival and keep his fame alive, had only managed to complete eight of the twelve paintings of his legacy, filling the remaining packages with junk as a joke. Campion visits Tommy's cottage and finds Max there, all traces of Tommy burnt. He returns to Little Venice later, and finds Max in a blazing row with Belle ‚Äì he has insisted he must take the remaining Lafcadio works abroad and sell them, and she has refused to let him. Sure now that Max had Tommy fake the last four paintings for him, Campion gets further proof in the form of a drawing uncovered in Paris by Linda. He meets Max and they go out to dinner, where Max has him sample a strange and rare wine from Romania. Too late, Campion recalls the wine has a terribly intoxicating effect if taken after spirits ‚Äì and Max had made sure Campion drank much gin before dinner. After a drunken tour of town, Max leads Campion to the edge of a Tube platform, and pushes hard ‚Äì only to be stopped by the plain-clothes men Oates has had on their tail, after a meeting with Campion that morning. Visiting Fustian in prison, Campion finds him a gibbering lunatic, his mind pushed over the edge by the defeat of his schemes.

The novel is dedicated: \\"To the priests, the soldiers, the judges, to those people who educate, instruct and govern men, I dedicate these pages of Murder and Blood.\\" Plot summary Auguste Rodin, litho for Le Jardin des supplices, Ambroise Vollard, 1902 Published at the height of the Dreyfus affair, Mirbeau's novel is a loosely assembled reworking of texts composed at different eras, featuring different styles, and showcasing different characters. Beginning with material stemming from articles on the 'Law of Murder' discussed in the \\"Frontispiece\\" (\\"The Manuscript\\"), the novel continues with a farcical critique of French politics with \\"En Mission\\" (\\"The Mission\\"): a French politician's aide is sent on a pseudo-scientific expedition to China when his presence at home would be compromising. It then moves on to an account of a visit to a Cantonese prison by a narrator accompanied by the sadist and hysteric Clara, who delights in witnessing flayings, crucifixions and numerous tortures, all done in beautifully laid out and groomed gardens, and explaining the beauty of torture to her companion. Finally she attains hysterical orgasm and passes out in exhaustion, only to begin again a few days later (\\"Le Jardin des supplices\\", \\"The Garden\\"). Commentary Torture Garden, New York, 1931 There is an allegory about the hypocrisy of European 'civilisation' and about the 'Law of Murder'. There is also a denunciation of bloody French and British colonialism and a ferocious attack on what Mirbeau saw as the corrupt morality of bourgeois capitalist society and the state, which he believed were based on murder. But Mirbeau's multiple transgressions of the rules of verisimilitude and his disregard for novelistic convention confuse the issue of the novel's genre affiliation and leave open the question of the author's moral message, leaving the readers of today in a state of wonderment, perplexity, and shock.  Quotes  * Woman possesses the cosmic force of an element, an invincible force of destruction, like nature's. She is, in herself alone, all nature! Being the matrix of life, she is by that very fact the matrix of death - since it is from death that life is perpetually reborn, and since to annihilate death would be to kill life at its only fertile source. ~\\"The Manuscript\\" * To take something from a person and keep it for oneself: that is robbery. To take something from one person and then turn it over to another in exchange for as much money as you can get: that is business. Robbery is so much more stupid, since it is satisfied with a single, frequently dangerous profit; whereas in business it can be doubled without danger. ~\\"The Mission,\\" Chapter 2 * There is only one trait which is irreparable in a statesman: honesty! Honesty is negative and sterile; it is ignorant of the correct evaluation of appetite and ambition - the only powers through which you can found anything durable. ~\\"The Mission,\\" Chapter 3 * You're obliged to pretend respect for people and institutions you think absurd. You live attached in a cowardly fashion to moral and social conventions you despise, condemn, and know lack all foundation. It is that permanent contradiction between your ideas and desires and all the dead formalities and vain pretenses of your civilization which makes you sad, troubled and unbalanced. In that intolerable conflict you lose all joy of life and all feeling of personality, because at every moment they suppress and restrain and check the free play of your powers. That's the poisoned and mortal wound of the civilized world. ~\\"The Mission,\\" Chapter 8 * Alas, the gates of life never swing open except upon death, never open except upon the palaces and gardens of death. And the universe appears to me like an immense, inexorable torture-garden. Blood everywhere and, where there is most life, horrible tormentors who dig your flesh, saw your bones, and retract your skin with sinister, joyful faces. ~\\"The Garden,\\" Chapter 9 * Ah, yes! the Torture Garden! Passions, appetites, greed, hatred, and lies; law, social institutions, justice, love, glory, heroism, and religion: these are its monstrous flowers and its hideous instruments of eternal human suffering. What I saw today, and what I heard, is no more than a symbol to me of the entire earth. I have vainly sought a respite in quietude and repose in death, and I can find them nowhere. ~\\"The Garden,\\" Chapter 9  Translations  * The first Spanish translation, by Ramon Sempau and C.

Logarithmic spiral Golden triangles inscribed in a logarithmic spiral The golden triangle is used to form some points of a logarithmic spiral. By bisecting one of the base angles, a new point is created that in turn, makes another golden triangle. The bisection process can be continued infinitely, creating an infinite number of golden triangles. A logarithmic spiral can be drawn through the vertices. This spiral is also known as an equiangular spiral, a term coined by Ren√© Descartes. \\"If a straight line is drawn from the pole to any point on the curve, it cuts the curve at precisely the same angle,\\" hence equiangular.

History Early work The Russian ichthyologist Lev Berg proposed directed mass mutations as the main mechanism for evolution in his anti- Darwinian book Nomogenesis; or, Evolution Determined by Law (1922). Berg's theory was both mutationist (involving mutation in place of selection) and orthogenetic (involving direction). Early studies of \\"directed mutation\\" were performed by German geneticists. Richard Goldschmidt claimed to have produced evidence for directed mutation in 1929 in his experiments on Drosophila fruit flies exposed to elevated temperatures. Viktor Jollos (1887‚Äì1941) in the 1930s had also carried out experiments on Drosophila and written that his results had confirmed Goldschmidt's work which was evidence for directed mutation in contrast to natural selection. However, later American geneticists were unable to replicate these experiments and the concepts fell out of favour compared to the standard Darwinian mechanism of randomly occurring mutations. Recent studies Directed mutagenesis was re-proposed in 1988 by John Cairns who was studying Escherichia coli that lacked the ability to metabolize lactose. He grew these bacteria in media in which lactose was the only source of energy. In doing so, he found that the rate at which the bacteria evolved the ability to metabolize lactose was many orders of magnitude higher than would be expected if the mutations were truly random. This inspired him to propose that the mutations that had occurred had been directed at those genes involved in lactose utilization. Later support for this hypothesis came from Susan Rosenberg, then at the University of Alberta, who found that an enzyme involved in DNA recombinational repair, recBCD, was necessary for the directed mutagenesis observed by Cairns and colleagues in 1989. The directed mutagenesis hypothesis was challenged in 2002, by work showing that the phenomenon was due to general hypermutability due to selected gene amplification, followed by natural selection, and was thus a standard Darwinian process. Later research from 2007 however, concluded that amplification could not account for the adaptive mutation and that \\"mutants that appear during the first few days of lactose selection are true revertants that arise in a single step\\".

It was written by Katharine DeBrecht and was published by World Ahead Publishing in 2005. DeBrecht told the media that she felt compelled to write the book because \\"children are inundated with (liberal) books like It's Just a Plant: A Children's Story of Marijuana and No George, No: The Reparenting of George W. Bush.\\" Background The book was first announced by US News & World Report, which called it \\"a picture book for kid conservatives\\".Washington Whispers ‚Äì US News and World Report Domestic reactions along political lines included radio host Rush Limbaugh, who praised the book.Washington Times: ‚ÄòHelp! Mom!‚Äô casts liberals as villains. October 16, 2005. After Limbaugh's on-air praise, the book's position on Amazon.com sales charts rose significantly, and at one point it trailed only the latest edition Harry Potter in children's books. However, it became controversial and was mocked by The Daily Show along with the book Why Mommy is a Democrat for the notion that young children lack the ability to grasp politics and are too impressionable to be exposed to such material.The Daily Show: October 3, 2007 ‚Äì TV Squad Responding to the media coverage, Philippe Reines, the press secretary for Sen. Hillary Clinton ‚Äì who is one of the book's cartoon villains ‚Äì fired back, \\"Can‚Äôt wait for the sequel, Help! Mom! I Can‚Äôt Read This Book Because Republicans Have Cut Literacy Programs!\\" DeBrecht replied, \\"It's ironic that Hillary's press secretary would call for more government intrusion into our lives while bashing my book...Evidently Hillary thinks it takes a village to teach a child to read!\\" Reines later responded by claiming that sales of the book must have been poor, in spite of evidence to the contrary.The Hill: In the know.

They play fast punk rock with pop, thrashcore and hardcore influences. Their lyrics are sometimes labeled \\"emo\\" postfact. Band members are Brian McGee (vocals and guitar), Sean Rule (drums) and Joel Tannenbaum (bass). History Formation and first three albums (1992‚Äì1998) McGee, Rule and Tannenbaum met at a private high school in Wilmington, Delaware in 1989. In 1992, they formed a band called Plow and recorded two demo tapes (\\"Old Country Church Broadcast\\" and \\"Warped Sense of Humor\\"). They began playing shows in Delaware and Southeast Pennsylvania over the next 18 months. In 1994, Tannenbaum moved to West Chester, Pennsylvania where the band played with other regional acts and began working with the newly started Creep Records (based in West Chester) and Coolidge Records (based in New Jersey). Plow changed its name to \\"Plow United\\" when a band of the same name from Baltimore, Maryland sent them a letter claiming rights to the name. A reproduction of the letter can be found inside the cover of their eponymous debut album, which Creep Records released that same year. Plow United played continuously throughout the Northeastern United States from 1994 until 1997. Armed with their Coolidge and Creep releases, and coupled with their beloved van, Sadi, they also toured the United States multiple times, eventually taking their music as far as Canada. They shared lineups at shows with national acts like Lagwagon, At the Drive- In, Bouncing Souls and Good Riddance. In 1996, the band recorded and released their second record (\\"Goodnight Sellout\\"), and received attention from major labels. They declined to pursue a career in rock and roll, however, and in 1997 the band broke up at the height of its popularity. In 1998 Creep Records released a posthumous third LP (\\"Narcolepsy\\"), a darker take on the band's loose, aggressive pop punk sound. In 1998, Plow United reformed to play three shows in New York and Pennsylvania to promote the release of \\"Narcolepsy\\". Hiatus (1998‚Äì2010) In 2000, Coolidge Records released a compilation of singles and other non-album tracks (The Dustbin of History). McGee played in Throttle Jockey and briefly as a second guitarist in Super Hi-5 with Sid Carney, Arik Victor and Mike Bardzik. He attended John C. Campbell Folk School, Haywood Community College, and Penland School of Crafts. He lived for a time in North Carolina, where he was elected president of the North Carolina chapter of the WPA (Werewolf Protection Agency) . Brian played and recorded with his old school folk/bluegrass/country rock and roll band Brian McGee and the Hollow Speed from 2005 to 2010. After recording his latest album (\\"The Taking Or The Leaving\\"), McGee dropped the Hollow Speed tag and now performs his solo material under Brian McGee. Visit www.brianmcgeemusic.com for more information. Tannenbaum moved on to indie pop bands ‚Äì The Skywriters and The Snow Fairies ‚Äì as well as recording a solo album \\"Music Should Be Seen and Not Heard\\" under the name The Whales on the Best Kept Secret tape label. He left Philadelphia in 2001 for long stints in The United Kingdom and Hawaii. He returned to Philadelphia in 2008. In 2010, he joined the indie-pop band Glitter, featuring members of The Skywriters, The Snow Fairies and The 500s. Around the time of the Plow United reunion, he started the band Ex Friends with designer and illustrator JP Flexner on drums. Rule began teaching high school math in 1997 at Salesianum School and later became a math teacher at Central Oregon Community College. He played in the thrash band Hands On Throat, and also in the ska band Necktie Killer (both based in Bend, Oregon). From 1998 to 2011, the band received requests to play more shows, all of which were declined. Reunion (2011‚Äìpresent) On September 24, 2011, Plow United played their first show after an almost 13-year hiatus at the inaugural Riot Fest East at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Preceding Riot Fest East, the band came to an amicable agreement with Creep Records that allowed them to take control of their master tapes from the albums and re-release old material. A compilation LP (\\"Sleepwalk: A Retrospective\\"), on the Paper + Plastick label, was released for sale at Riot Fest East. In the time since Riot Fest, Plow United has played shows along the East Coast, including performances at Insubordination Fest 2012 in Baltimore, Maryland, and Fest 2012 in Gainesville, Florida. In early 2012, they did a three-day stint of support shows for Less Than Jake. In Summer 2012, Plow United returned to the studio for the first time in 14 years to record new material. Twelve of the 17 tracks recorded at those sessions would comprise the full - length \\"Marching Band\\", which was released on April 2, 2013 on the Jump Start Label. Two other songs from that session were released as a 7\\" single on Kiss of Death Records. Two additional songs are slated for a split 7\\" release with Mikey Erg, and one other song appeared on the compilation \\"For the Shore\\" on Chance 4 Change Records. In March 2013, the band played a series of shows (including recording live on WXPN at Studio A in Philadelphia and performing live on The Chris Gethard Show) to support their new album, \\"Marching Band\\" released on the Jump Start label. They have more shows and festival appearances planned for spring and summer 2013. Plow United maintains a website at plowunited.net.

With his longtime backup band, Muddy Waters plays a mix of his older popular tunes and some newer compositions. Chess Records released the album in the United States in December 1960. In 2001, it issued a remastered version with an additional three tracks recorded in Chicago in June 1960. At Newport 1960 is sometimes referred to as the first live blues album and has received critical acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine have included it at number 348 on its list of \\"500 Greatest Albums of all Time\\". Along with the songs on The Best of Muddy Waters (1958), the album was an important influence on the emerging younger white blues scenes in the U.S. and U.K. Background Muddy Waters was one of the most popular blues artists of the 1950s. Beginning in 1948, he had fifteen singles that appeared on the Billboard Rhythm & Blues Records chart. His debut album, The Best of Muddy Waters (1958), contained twelve of his hits. However, by 1960, what had been the traditional blues audiences were moving away from Chicago-style blues towards the more polished R&B; and soul sounds. Chess released Sings Big Bill Broonzy (1960), a collection of Muddy Waters' interpretations of songs by the blues musician Big Bill Broonzy. When he performed at the Newport Jazz Festival, his electric blues band consisted of Otis Spann (piano, vocals), Pat Hare (guitar), James Cotton (harmonica), Andrew Stevens (bass) and Francis Clay (drums). Recording The gig was scheduled for Sunday afternoon, July 3. The day before, performances by Ray Charles and singing group Lambert, Hendricks and Ross were met with unruly crowds. About 300 drunken revelers made a commotion during Charles' performance and the police responded with teargas and water hoses. The riots became so out of control that the National Guard was called in at midnight to calm the crowd. When Waters and his band arrived on the scheduled day, they intended to drive back on the next day, until driver James Cotton saw John Lee Hooker standing at a corner, his guitar on his back without a guitar case. Cotton said Hooker should get into his car to get the musicians out of harm's way. At the same time, the city council decided to cancel the concert, but concert promoter George Wein convinced them when he said that the United States Information Agency (USIA) planned to film the festival to teach American culture in other countries. Before Waters' performance, his band backed Otis Spann, who was the band leader, and John Lee Hooker. At about 7 p.m., Muddy Waters entered the stage, wearing black, while the rest of the band wore white suits. At Newport 1960 opens with then-unreleased \\"I Got My Brand on You\\", which was recorded one month prior, and \\"(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man\\", both written by Willie Dixon. Next are the Big Joe Williams cover \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\", Oden's \\"Soon Forgotten\\", Dixon's \\"Tiger in Your Tank\\" and Broonzy's \\"I Feel So Good\\". At the end of \\"I've Got My Mojo Working\\", every bluesman gathered at the stage to perform medleys of blues standards. Jazz poet and directorate of Newport Langston Hughes spontaneously wrote a closing song, the slow \\"Goodbye Newport Blues\\", this time with Spann as singer, as Waters was too exhausted to perform. Chess Records released the album in the U.S. on November 15, 1960, which was produced by label owner Leonard Chess. Chess issued the album on CD in 1986. MCA Records, the successor to Chess, digitally remastered it in 2001 with a significantly better sound quality. The remastered version contains three bonus tracks recorded in Chicago in June 1960. Album cover The album cover depicts Muddy Waters at the Newport Jazz Festival holding a semi-acoustic guitar. When the photographer, William Claxton, asked him to pose for the cover, Waters left his Fender Telecaster (which he played during the concert) on the stage and instead held the semi-acoustic guitar, belonging to his friend John Lee Hooker. Legacy At Newport 1960 is generally praised for the powerful and fizzy performance by Waters and his band. Cub Koda, writing for AllMusic, says that Waters \\"lays it down tough and cool with a set that literally had [the audience] dancing in the aisles by the set close\\". Furthermore, he remarked that the opening track, \\"I Got My Brand on You\\", \\"positively burns the relatively tame\\". Matthew Oshinsky, in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, praises the \\"merciless refrain\\" in \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" and the \\"unvarnished moaning\\" in \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\". He also enjoys Muddy's powerful baritone, Cotton's harmonica playing, Spann's \\"pub piano\\"‚Äìlike playing and the overall danceable music. Chris Smith, in 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music, praises Waters's \\"growly vocal presentation, energetic stage presence, and electrifying (literally and figuratively) performances.\\" The album is ranked number 348 on Rolling Stones \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\", in which the band's playing is described as \\"tough, tight and in the groove\\" and Cotton's harmonica jams are mentioned as \\"a special treat,\\" In Vibe magazine's \\"100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century\\", a critic calls the album \\"immortal.\\" The album is mentioned in The Rough Guide to Blues 100 Essential CDs. Many musicians and bands, such as the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, AC/DC and Led Zeppelin, have been influenced by his electric sound and used this and his greatest hits album in creating a hard rock sound. At Newport 1960 was one of the first live blues albums.

Ernst Lubitsch directed the picture.The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg at the silentera.com database Plot Young Crown Prince Karl Heinrich (Philippe De Lacy), heir to the kingdom of Karlsburg, is brought to live with his stern uncle, King Karl VII (Gustav von Seyffertitz). The king immediately dismisses the boy's nanny (Edythe Chapman) without telling the youngster to avoid an emotional farewell. Dr. Friedrich J√ºttner (Jean Hersholt), his new tutor, proves to be sympathetic, and they become lifelong friends. Nonetheless, despite the commoners' belief that it must be wonderful to be him, the boy grows up lonely, without playmates his own age. Upon passing his high school examination in 1901 with the help of Dr.J√ºttner, the young prince (Ram√≥n Novarro) is delighted to learn that both he and J√ºttner are being sent to Heidelberg, where he will continue his education. When they arrive, Karl's servant is appalled at the rooms provided for the prince and J√ºttner at the inn of Ruder (Otis Harlan). When Ruder's niece Kathi (Norma Shearer) stoutly defends the centuries-old family business, Karl is entranced by her, and decides to stay. He is quickly made a member of Corps Saxonia, a student society. Later that day, Karl tries to kiss Kathi, only to learn that she is engaged. Her family approves of her fiance, but she is not so sure about him. She eventually confesses to Karl that, despite the vast social gulf between them, she has fallen in love with him. Karl feels the same about her and swears that he will let nothing separate them. When he takes her boating, their rower, Johann Kellermann, turns his back to them to give them some privacy. Karl jokingly tells him that, when he is king, he will make Kellermann his majordomo. Then J√ºttner receives a letter from the king ordering him to inform Karl that he has selected a princess for him to marry. J√ºttner cannot bring himself to destroy his friend's happiness. That same day, however, Prime Minister von Haugk (Edward Connelly) arrives with the news that the king is seriously ill, and that Karl must go home and take up the reins of government. When Karl sees his uncle, he is told of the matrimonial plans. While Karl is still reeling from the shock, the old king dies, followed by J√ºttner. Later, von Haugk presses the new monarch about the marriage. The anguished Karl signs the document for the wedding. Then Kellermann shows up to take the job Karl had offered him. When Karl asks him about Kathi, he learns that she is still waiting for him. He goes to see her one last time. In the last scene, Karl is shown riding through the streets in a carriage with his bride. One onlooker remarks that it must be wonderful to be king, unaware of Karl's misery.

Stroheim declined, opting instead to leave MGM and begin work on The Wedding March (1928). Thalberg then tried to attach E.A. Dupont, and then John S. Robertson to the project, but both passed on it.Soares, Andr√©; Beyond paradise: the life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martin's Press, New York, 2002; p. 121-122 He settled on thirty-four-year-old German √©migr√© Ernst Lubitsch. Novarro was cast after John Gilbert was considered. Lubitsch felt that both Novarro and Shearer were miscast,Eyman, Scott; Ernst Lubitsch: laughter in Paradise; Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1993; p. 134 but was unable to override the studio's casting decisions.Soares, Andr√©; Beyond paradise: the life of Ramon Novarro; p. 121 Lubitsch's insistence on multiple takes and minimal rehearsal time were hard on both leads. Shearer even complained to Thalberg, her fiance, about Lubitsch's penchant for acting out scenes for the actors before they were shot. Thalberg told her that \\"everyone has a lot to learn from Lubitsch.\\"Eyman, Scott; Ernst Lubitsch: laughter in Paradise; p. 132 The love scene in the beer garden, which is acclaimed as one of the best scenes in the film by modern critics, was allegedly a headache for the director, who had it reshot entirely, but was still unhappy with it. It was rumored that the love scene in the film was reshot by John M. Stahl, but Lubitsch's assistant on the film, Andrew Marton, denied this. According to director King Vidor, Lubitsch also made Novarro film \\"a buddy scene with an effeminate extra\\"Soares, Andr√©; Beyond paradise: the life of Ramon Novarro; p. 122 in the hopes of \\"playing up the charge between them.\\"Mann, W; Behind the screen; Penguin, New York, 2002; p. 97 Novarro, no doubt, was extremely uncomfortable doing the scene and resentful of being put in that situation by the director; Novarro was extremely guarded about his own homosexuality his entire life. The film was in production for more than 108 days and cost $1,205,000. A stickler for authenticity, Lubitsch drove up the budget significantly, infuriating the studio. For instance, he had costume designer Ali Hubert bring thirty-two trunks of wardrobe and props from Europe for use in the film. Following principal photography, he went to Germany to film establishing shots, none of which were used in the finished movie; what little location work there is in the finished film was shot in Laurel Canyon. Reception Although now considered a classic by many film historians, it was far from a unanimous critical success during its original theatrical run. In a review for The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote \\"Mr. Novarro is natural and earnest, but he is a little too Latin in appearance for the r√¥le. Norma Shearer is attractive as Kathi. She, however, does not seem to put her soul into the part. She, too, acts well, but, like Mr. Novarro, she does not respond, as other players have done, to Mr. Lubitsch's direction. The ablest acting in this piece of work is done by Jean Hersholt as Dr. Guttner (sic) and Gustav von Seyffertitz as the King. Their efforts in all their scenes reveal their sensitiveness to the direction.\\" Despite being a popular film with movie goers, the exorbitant production cost of Student Prince kept it from making a profit; the film lost $307,000.Soares, Andr√©; Beyond paradise: the life of Ramon Novarro; p. 125Soares, Andr√©; Beyond paradise: the life of Ramon Novarro; p. 371 Impact Many critics consider it one of Lubitsch's finest silent films, and it has received better reviews than MGM's 1954 color remake based on Sigmund Romberg's operetta version of the story.

WVOK-FM changed its call letters to WRKK in 1979; it kept its Rock format until 1983, when it became \\"K Country.\\" Several format changes later, the station is now known in Birmingham as WZRR \\"Rock 99.5.\\" The WVOK call letters would not be heard on the FM dial again until the creation of a new radio station in Oxford, Alabama. Jimmy and Geraldine Woodard, owners of WEYY-FM in Talladega, Alabama, were granted a construction permit for the first commercial FM station licensed to Oxford. The station began broadcast in 1990 as WKFN \\"K98\\" on the 97.9 MHz frequency. In 1992, WKFN acquired the WVOK call letters; however, its \\"K98\\" nickname remained the same. Recent history On February 19, 1990, K98 signed on as an Adult Contemporary station, playing music from the 1950s through the 1990s. At that time, WVOK was one of very few local stations to compete against the 100,000-watt Country music station WHMA of Anniston, known by listeners as \\"Alabama 100.\\" November 6, 1996 Susquehanna Radio purchased Alabama 100 and moved it to College Park, Georgia in early 2001. After the move, Alabama 100 changed its call letters to WWWQ and became a Top-40 station serving the Atlanta radio market. As a result, WVOK saw an increase in their local Arbitron ratings. Since K98 began broadcast in 1990, it has employed a number of various disk jockeys, including Rick Burgess from the syndicated \\"Rick and Bubba\\" radio program. Its radio format, however, has seen little change. Shortly after Clear Channel station WQEN (\\"103-7 the Q\\") relocated its transmitter from Springville, Alabama to Birmingham in early 2005, WVOK briefly changed its music format to Contemporary Hit Radio. They have, however, since returned to the lighter Hot AC format. In early 2006, WVOK-FM began using its frequency and call letters often (instead of the \\"K98\\" nickname) as its station identifier. Its slogan is \\"The Best of the 80's, 90's and Today\\". In early 2008, a new morning talk show called The Steve and Carl Show signed on. Other facts * WVOK-FM is recognized as one of the only radio stations in Alabama to remain on the air during the \\"Storm of the Century\\" in 1993. WVOK received honors from the city of Oxford, former Alabama Governor Guy Hunt, and others for keeping the station on the air through the duration of the storm. * WVOK-FM is one of two stations in the Anniston/Gadsden market whose call letters were previously assigned to Top 40 stations in Birmingham. The other is WKXX. * There has been much speculation about the WVOK call sign meaning over the years. Although disk jockeys from the original WVOK-AM radio station sometimes referred to it as the Voice Of Kindness, the call letters themselves actually do not stand for anything.

It was released in Japan in August 1986. It is sometimes called a digital duplicator or printer-duplicator, as newer models can be used as a network printer as well as a stand-alone duplicator. When printing or copying many duplicates (generally more than 20) of the same content, it is typically far less expensive per page than a conventional photocopier, laser printer, or inkjet printer.  Process  Diagram of internal mechanism and paper flow in a Risograph The underlying technology is very similar to a mimeograph. It brings together several processes which were previously carried out manually, for example using the Riso Print Gocco system or the Gestetner system. The original is scanned through the machine and a master is created, by means of tiny heat spots on a thermal plate burning voids (corresponding to image areas) in a master sheet. This master is then wrapped around a drum and ink is forced through the voids in the master. The paper runs flat through the machine while the drum rotates at high speed to create each image on the paper. This simple technology is highly reliable compared to a standard photocopier and can achieve both very high speed (typically 150 pages per minute) and very low costs. A good lifespan for a risograph might involve making 100,000 masters and 5,000,000 copies. Risograph printers use a soy ink made from vegetable soybean oil. One disadvantage of this soy based ink printing medium is that all paper stock has to be uncoated for the ink to dry and adhere to the paper stock. Because the process involves real ink like in offset printing, and does not require heat to fix the image on the paper that a photocopier or laser printer does, the output from a risograph can be treated like any offset-printed material. This means that sheets which have been through a risograph may be fed through a laser printer afterwards and vice versa. Risographs have typically had interchangeable color inks and drums allowing for printing in different colors or using spot color in a single print job. The Riso MZ series models have two ink drums, thereby allowing two colors to be printed in one pass.  Manufacture  The key master-making thermal head component is manufactured by Toshiba. Machines similar to Risographs are manufactured by Ricoh, Gestetner, Rex Rotary, Nashuatec and Duplo. Gestetner, Rex Rotary and Nashuatec are now owned by Ricoh.  Use  For schools, clubs, churches, colleges, political campaigns, and other short- run print jobs, the risograph bridges the gap between a standard photocopier (which is cheaper up to about 50 copies) and using a commercial lithograph printer (which is cheaper over about 10,000 copies).

According to a 1988 census, it has a population of 3,663 Quechua speakers divided among about 800 families. The island is circular and about in size. It has two mountain peaks, Pachatata (\\"father earth\\") and Pachamama (\\"mother earth\\"), with ancient Inca and Tiwanaku ruins on top of both. The hillsides are terraced, mostly worked by hand, and planted with wheat, quinoa, potatoes, and other vegetables. Livestock, including sheep, also graze the slopes. Amantani is known as the \\"Island of the Kantuta\\", after the national flower of Peru and Bolivia, which grows plentifully on the island. Overview The temples at the top of the peaks are generally closed during the year. Entrance is permitted on the morning of the annual feast day on or around January 20 (the third Thursday in January), at which time the island's population divides in two, with each group gathering at its respective temple. A race is then held from each peak to a point somewhere between the two, and a representative of each group is chosen to run. According to tradition, a victory for Pachamama portends a bountiful harvest in the year to come. Similar to the Taquile√±os, the inhabitants of Amantani are also known for their textiles, as well as their ceramics. Most of the inhabitants live in houses of adobe. There is a small health clinic and school on Amantan√≠. The island has no cars but does have a generator, though it is no longer functional. There are no hotels, but some of the families on Amantani open their homes to tourists for overnight stays and provide cooked meals, arranged through tour guides. The families who do so are required to have a special room set aside for the tourists and must fit a code by the tour companies that help them. Guests typically take food staples (cooking oil, rice, fruits) as a gift or school supplies for the children on the island. Sweets and sugar are not recommended as regular dental care is uncommon on the island. They hold nightly traditional dance shows for the tourists where they offer to dress them up in their traditional clothes and participate. Women of the families also offer self-made alpaca-hats to their visitors as cover for the night-breeze, which the visitors are most welcome to buy at the end of their stay.

It was first published in paperback editions by Belmont Books in the United States in October 1966 and by Quartet in the United Kingdom in September 1974. Later it was revised and expanded as Two Hawks from Earth, in which form it was first published, also in paperback by Ace Books, in May 1979. This edition was reprinted by Berkley Books in July 1985. A trade paperback edition was published by MonkeyBrain Books with a new afterword by Christopher Paul Carey in May 2009. An authorized sequel, Man of War: A Two Hawks Adventure, was written by Heidi Ruby Miller and published in 2017. Plot summary Roger Two Hawks, an Iroquois serving as a combat pilot in World War II, is shot down during a raid on Ploie≈üti, Romania. While parachuting he feels a strange dizziness. Being hidden by locals, he realises that they neither look nor speak like Romanians, but rather resemble Native Americans and speak a language distantly resembling that of his own tribe. The mystery is resolved when he sees a globe and finds that he is in a world where the continent of America does not exist, having been drowned for the whole of humanity's tenure on Earth. As a result, the ancestors of the various Native American tribes did not cross the non-existent Bering Strait but wandered westward into Europe, taking the general place of the Slavs in our history. \\"Hatti\\" (Greece) was colonised by the Hittites of our timeline, while Akhaivia (Italy) was colonised by the Greeks instead of the Sabines, Latins, Voluscans and Samnites. The Iroquois live in Romania and the Ukraine, which is known as Hotinohsonih in this timeline, while the Algonquin occupy Kinukkinuk, roughly co-terminous with our Czech Republic and the Aztecs dominate an equivalent of Russia. \\"Blodland\\" is analogous to England, while \\"Norland\\" is roughly parallel to Scotland. \\"Rasna\\" is cognate with France and Belgium (apart from Normandy, which is \\"Grettirsland\\"). \\"New Crete\\" is comparable to the Iberian peninsula, \\"Doria\\" matches the Balkan region on our world, and \\"Saariset\\" (Japan) is dominated by Finnish speakers. \\"Dravidia\\" is India's equivalent in this universe and is a major military power. While a charismatic Irish religious figure, Hemilka, arose in the fourteenth century in this world, which therefore has a surprising analogue to Christianity as a result, Hemilkism is not an imperialist faith and does not similarly dominate its world. Though very different from our world, in this reality, too, a war is going on resembling the one which Two Hawks left behind, with Perkunisha, an alternate aggressive Germany-analogue trying to conquer Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa (though its dominant people are not Germanic but rather Lithuanian). It has already occupied geographical areas analogous to our timeline's Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Poland as a consequence, although not Tyrsland (Sweden). Without North America, the Gulf Stream flows differently and Europe is perceptibly colder in winter. In addition, horses, tobacco, turkeys, camels, rubber and chocolate originated in the Americas, and thus none exist in this timeline. Two Hawks very quickly gets involved. His knowledge and abilities are very much in demand, since this world does not yet have heavier-than-air flight, and its possession could decide the war. However, without military assistance from any United States equivalent, the war is going badly for the anti-Perkunishan allies. He goes through a very fast-paced series of adventures, involving such elements as Hittites who survived into the 20th century, a Luftwaffe pilot who also ended up in this world, an England which had never known a Roman Empire nor a Norman Conquest but has many Cretan and Semitic elements in its makeup, an unknown chapter in the life of Elizabethan adventurer Humphrey Gilbert, an Arab-colonised South Africa (known as Ikhwan) and Hivika, a mysterious island on the site of our world's Colorado, where an underground Polynesian temple is to be found, suggesting that Polynesians colonised the North American archipelago in the thirteenth century. Two Hawks also experiences a most tempestuous love affair. At the book's end, it is disclosed that Two Hawks is actually not from our alternate world, but from one where Kaiser Wilhelm IV (rather than Adolf Hitler) controls an expansionist, imperialist Germany in its Second World War.

Ard Crags is a fell in the Lake District in Cumbria, England, it is situated in the Newlands Valley just off the minor road between Keswick and Buttermere. The Ordnance Survey officially records the fell's altitude at 581 metres (1,906 feet), considerably more than the approximate 1,860 feet that Alfred Wainwright attributed to it in his Pictorial Guide to the North Western Fells, published in 1964 well before the advent of satellite mapping. Ard Crags is situated close to other higher fells such as Causey Pike and Eel Crag and can be easily overlooked. However, viewed from certain points in the Rigg Beck or Newlands valley area it presents a clearly defined and pyramidal shape which catches the eye. Topography A long high ridge sweeps east from Whiteless Pike, via Wandope, Crag Hill, Sail (Lake District) and Causey Pike, crossing from Buttermere to Stair. Running parallel to the south is a lower ridge, a tenuous connection made centrally at Sail. This lower ridge consists of Knott Rigg and Ard Crags, and has a beautiful narrow and airy character. Ard Crags forms the eastern half of the ridge, rising between Keskadale and the side valley of Rigg Beck. It is sometimes referred to as Aikin Knott, the name of the rash of rock on the nose of the ridge. Geology The Ard Crags ridge is an example of the Buttermere Formation, an olistostrome of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Ascents The fell is linked by a ridge to another ‚ÄúWainwright‚Äù fell, Knott Rigg and most walkers will climb both hills together in the same walk. There are two possible starting points, one is at Rigg Beck in Newlands, near the site of the eccentrically painted ‚Äúpurple house‚Äù which was destroyed by fire in June 2008. This route goes directly up the eastern ridge passing the outcrop of Aikin Knott after which the ridge narrows considerably to reach the heather covered summit which gives a precipitous view of Newlands. The alternative starting point is the car park at Newlands Hause which stands at an altitude of 333 metres (1,093 feet), the summit of Knott Rigg is crossed first before continuing onto Ard Crags. Summit The narrow ridge is carpeted with heather, the top marked by a small cairn. The view from the summit is severely restricted in a north and westerly direction by the higher Eel Crag to Causey Pike ridge, the best feature of the view is the aerial view of the Newlands valley while Scafell Pike can be glimpsed eight miles away through a gap in the hills to the south.

He was also well known for art marketing and is generally credited as the co-creator of the limited edition art print market, which supplanted the traditional method where artists sold original works on an individual basis. Limited edition art prints are now the standard method of marketing paintings and similar works to the general public. Harm was born Ray Auvil in Randolph County, West Virginia; his father was a concert violinist who also was a woodsman and herbalist. His name was changed to Harm after his parents divorced and his mother remarried to William Harm. He left West Virginia in his mid teens to become a cowboy in the American West, eventually competing on the rodeo circuit and also training horses for the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus. His service in the United States Navy during World War II allowed him to take advantage of the GI Bill for continuing education. Harm used the opportunity to enroll in art school and afterwards became a painter. While selling individual paintings, Harm worked in construction and horse training to make ends meet. In 1961 Harm's work attracted the attention of Wood Hannah, a businessman and art collector from Louisville, Kentucky. The two men came up with the idea of making high-quality art prints of Harm's paintings, which would be issued in limited print runs. The idea was a great success and gave birth to a marketing method for art that has brought commercial and financial success to thousands of artists. In 1963, he was appointed the first H. L. Donovan Artist-in- residence at the University of Kentucky. Harm later wrote a weekly nature column for The Louisville Times, and was a popular speaker and lecturer. Harm was a frequent guest on the radio call-in show Metz Here, hosted for many years by Milton Metz on Louisville's WHAS-AM. In his later life, Harm became a sharp critic of artists who copy their works from photographs by tracing directly over them or projecting an image onto a canvas and then tracing. This practice is now widespread throughout the limited-edition art industry. Harm has prided himself on basing his paintings on his own sketches taken from direct observations of wildlife. On occasion, Harm says he has used museum models of wildlife to get certain details correct, but otherwise his paintings come directly from his own work. Harm closed production of prints from his major collection in the late 1990s, with 195 pieces in the collection. He continued to do occasional works as fundraisers for various organizations. Harm and his wife, Cathy, eventually left Kentucky and settled on a ranch in Arizona, where he continued to work. His son, Ray Harm Jr. (better known as \\"Hap\\"), lives in Kentucky and sells prints from original works by his father that were not a part of the original major collection. An archive of Harm's signed prints, newspaper clippings, field notes, black and white photographs, exhibition catalogs, gallery announcements and 53 pieces of original correspondence is housed at the Filson Historical Society in Louisville. Harm died in Sonoita, Arizona on April 9, 2015.http://www.courier- journal.com/story/news/2015/04/16/popular-wildlife-artist-ray-harm- dies/25903633/ Honors * Named as one of the 10 most influential artists of the century by Decor Magazine. * Named Kentucky's Man of the Year in 1964. * Commissioned to paint a family of bald eagles by President John F.

It is a colorless solid that occurs in nature as the rare mineral frankdicksonite. Under standard conditions it adopts the fluorite structure and at high pressure the PbCl2 structure. Like CaF2, it is resilient to and insoluble in water. Above ca. 500 ¬∞C, BaF2 is corroded by moisture, but in dry environments it can be used up to 800 ¬∞C. Prolonged exposure to moisture degrades transmission in the vacuum UV range. It is less resistant to water than calcium fluoride, but it is the most resistant of all the optical fluorides to high-energy radiation, though its far ultraviolet transmittance is lower than that of the other fluorides. It is quite hard, very sensitive to thermal shock and fractures quite easily. Optical properties Barium fluoride is transparent from the ultraviolet to the infrared, from 150‚Äì200 nm to 11‚Äì11.5 ¬µm. It is used in windows for infrared spectroscopy, in particular in the field of fuel oil analysis. Its transmittance at 200 nm is relatively low (0.60), but at 500 nm it goes up to 0.96‚Äì0.97 and stays at that level until 9 ¬µm, then it starts falling off (0.85 for 10 ¬µm and 0.42 for 12 ¬µm). The refractive index is about 1.46 from 700 nm to 5 ¬µm. Barium fluoride is also a common, very fast (one of the fastest) scintillators for the detection of X-rays, gamma rays or other high energy particles. One of its applications is the detection of 511 keV gamma photons in positron emission tomography. It responds also to alpha and beta particles, but, unlike most scintillators, it does not emit ultraviolet light. It can be also used for detection of high- energy (10‚Äì150 MeV) neutrons, using pulse shape discrimination techniques to separate them from simultaneously occurring gamma photons. Barium fluoride is used as a preopacifying agent and in enamel and glazing frits production. Its other use is in the production of welding agents (an additive to some fluxes, a component of coatings for welding rods and in welding powders). It is also used in metallurgy, as a molten bath for refining aluminium. Gas phase structure In the vapor phase the BaF2 molecule is non-linear with an F-Ba-F angle of approximately 108¬∞. Its nonlinearity violates VSEPR theory. Ab initio calculations indicate that contributions from d orbitals in the shell below the valence shell are responsible. Another proposal is that polarisation of the electron core of the barium atom creates an approximately tetrahedral distribution of charge that interacts with the Ba-F bonds.

After the funeral, Tony happens to meet Fran Felstein, his father's longtime goomah, at his father's grave. They continue to meet, and Tony learns more about his father from her. He learns that, pressured by his mother Livia, his father took his childhood dog Tippy away; he gave it to Fran, and it became her son's dog. Fran also remembers Junior who, she says, almost used to stalk her; Junior tells Tony he loved her but was not bold enough to tell her. Fran also tells Tony about a one-time fling with President John F. Kennedy. Tony and Fran tour a midget car racetrack in New Egypt; she has explained that Tony's father had promised to leave her a share of the racetrack, but that Phil and Hesh Rabkin cheated her out of it. Tony undertakes to collect the money on her behalf and has a sitdown with Phil and Hesh, mediated by Johnny. While Hesh agrees to pay, Phil objects to paying 25%, and delays payment. When Tony spots him in the street, there is a car chase that ends with Phil crashing into a truck. Later, Tony is able to collect $150,000 for Fran. Junior, with his mental health and memory now improved due to new medication, says he is going stir crazy while still under house arrest. He begins going to every funeral he can, even when he knows the deceased only slightly, just to get out of the house. However, at the funeral of Concetta's husband, who died shortly after his wife, Junior begins crying uncontrollably and has to be helped away by Bobby and Janice. Junior later breaks down in his physician's office when he mentions the lack of purpose in his life. Christopher begins to spend time with J.T. Dolan, a television screenwriter he met in rehab. The two offer to support one another when they get the urge to use. After he loses a sports bet to J.T., Chris introduces him to the family's high-stakes poker games. J.T. runs up $60,000 in debt and starts missing payments; Chris and Little Paulie go to his apartment and beat him up. J.T. loses some writing jobs, causing him to turn to heroin. Chris then helps direct him back toward rehab. Tony's friendship with Fran begins to sour as he learns that his father was often with her when he was needed, including the night Livia was hospitalized for a miscarriage; on that occasion, Tony had to lie to his mother to protect his father. Furthermore, Fran starts to openly disparage Livia to Tony and, after claiming she was broke, buys expensive clothes with the money he obtained for her. Dr. Melfi suggests he could have more sympathy for Livia, forgive her, and forget. Tony remains unsympathetic, saying that Livia did make his father give Tippy away. As the episode closes, Tony starts regaling his buddies at the Bada Bing with exaggerated accounts of Fran's involvement with JFK. First appearances * J.T.

The Court found that merely reading the accused his or her rights is insufficient to discharge the right to counsel; the police must also provide the accused with access to legal aid or duty counsel. Cyril Prosper was pulled over by the police for driving erratically. The police noticed that he was severely inebriated and arrested him. They read him his rights and provided him access to a telephone and telephone directory to call a lawyer. He declined to call a lawyer in private practice as he said he could not afford it. He then agreed to take a Breathalyzer test. At trial Prosper successfully argued that Breathalyzer results were taken in violation of his Charter rights to counsel under section 10(b). The question before the Supreme Court was first, whether section 10(b) of the Charter imposes a substantive constitutional obligation on governments to ensure that duty counsel is available upon arrest or detention to provide free and immediate preliminary legal advice upon request. Second, whether the evidence should be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter as it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The court unanimously held that the Charter does not impose an obligation to ensure duty counsel is available upon arrest. In a five to three decision the Court held that the evidence should be excluded.

The first location was purchased with $5,000 of Arnold's savings and a loan taken out by him and his wife. Arnold sold the company to Phillips Petroleum in 1990 to pursue other interests in real estate and banking, but eventually restarted the company in 1994.Road Ranger and Kiswaukee College In 2008 Pilot Flying J announced it was partnering with Road Ranger and would market the diesel fuel at Road Ranger truck stop locations.

Shown without guns mounted, front oblique angle. Note heavy metal protective shrouding for the barrels, and circular openings for pan magazines. Square frame is intended to bolt into standard embrasures. The MAC mle 1931 machine gun (official French designation Mitrailleuse mod√®le 1931 - machine gun, model of 1931), was a machine gun used in French tanks of the World War II era, as well as in fortifications such as the Maginot line. It is also sometimes known as the JM Reibel, which actually stands for Jumelage de mitrailleuses Reibel, or Reibel twin-mounted guns and really refers to the specialized twin-mounting frame used in Maginot Line fortifications, while MAC mle 1931 refers to each gun. The JM twin-mounts were the standard emplacement for the mle 1931 in fixed fortifications, while tanks and other AFVs received single guns. Overview The Reibel machine gun is a gas operated weapon chambered in the 7.5 mm MAS cartridge and was loaded with vertical, side-mounted, 150-round pan magazines. The variant used in fortifications was modified with a different rifling to accommodate the balle D heavy ball type of ammunition.http://world.guns.ru/machine/mg96-e.htm Some other guns in French service during the late 1940s were converted to ground role, with adoption of the side-mounted 35-round box magazines and adapters for US M2 tripods. The modele 1931 machine gun is a gas operated weapon which fires from open bolt and in full automatic only. It is derived from the French FM 24/29 Fusil- Mitrailleur (light machine gun) also designed by Lt Colonel Reibel, and based on the Browning Automatic Rifle. The FM 24/29 was developed into a heavier machine gun capable of relatively sustained fire, by giving it an extremely thick and massive barrel, to act as a heat sink. This was necessary, since the FM 24/29 lacked a quick-change barrel or water-cooling and its normal light barrel would rapidly overheat and wear out, if fired in more than short bursts, with cooling rests between. The long stroke gas piston is located below the barrel and operates the vertically tilting bolt group. Ammunition is fed from side-mounted multi-layer 150-round pan magazines (with bullets pointing to the center of the round magazine). The gun can be modified to take magazines on either the left or right side, to ease magazine changes while mounted in the standard side-by-side JM twin-mount. Ejection is straight down, through the short chute attached to the base of the receiver, which in fortifications, usually led into a longer tube or chute that directed the spent cases into the ditches outside. The gun was fitted with a forward-curved pistol grip to aid control and a standard rifle-style trigger. When mounted in fortifications, the twin-mount included an adjustable twin-shoulder stock, a tubular metal bar that extended from the rear of the mounting frame, which mounted a horizontal crossbar, with shoulder pads on each end. The operator would face the breeches of the guns and place these pads against his shoulders. He would then use his body to control traverse, while his hands would grip the pistols grips to fire one or both guns. Elevation was controlled by a brass crank underneath the weapon. Twin mountings came in T and F configurations; F types used standard triggers and stocks and were used for embrasure mounts in casemates and cupolas, while the T featured a trigger operated by Bowden cable and was intended for remote use in retractable turrets. The standard for a mle 1931 in fixed emplacements was a JM Reibel twin-mount, complete with telescopic sight, azimuth and level indicators, elevation screw and spent case ejection chutes. It was manned by a crew of eight, including two gunners, two loaders, two assistant loaders (to fetch ammunition and reload pan magazines with a table-mounted reloading machine that took standard 5-round stripper clips), a mechanic to repair any faults or jams, and a commander to direct or coordinate fire. The purpose of pairing the guns was to allow for sustained and rapid fire. During normal use, the two guns would be fired in turn, allowing the other gun time to cool down. When called for, both guns could be fired together, increasing instantaneous rate of fire. Charts were posted on the walls in each emplacement, outlining standard operating technique: * normal fire was 150 rounds (one magazine) per minute, alternating between guns. Each gun would be fired for one minute, in bursts, until the magazine was empty. Then, the gunner would stop, and fire the second gun for a minute while the first gun cooled and was reloaded. Then the first gun could be used again. This rate of fire could be sustained for 3 minutes per gun, before the accumulated heat built to a dangerous level. * Accelerated rate was 450 rounds per minute (3 magazines) per gun and was achieved in the same way as normal fire; the gunner would fire off three magazines within a minute and then stop before his barrel overheated, and then repeat with the second. Due to the higher rate of fire, accelerated fire was limited to a maximum of two minutes per gun, since the guns would be so heated after firing 6 magazines each, they would be ready to overheat, even with a minute to cool down after the first 3 magazines. * Rapid fire; In cases of emergency, such as enemy crossing the barbed wire, the gunners were authorized to rapid-fire bursts of 75 rounds per gun, either in turn or simultaneously, allowing a full magazines worth to be fired in much less than a minute. Such a rapid rate would very quickly overheat the barrel if not limited to only 75 rounds. To help cool the guns down faster, buckets of water and water sprayers were kept next to each JM emplacement. Barrels were cooled either by spraying them with water (evaporative) or by removing the gun from the mount and dipping the barrel into the water bucket. Up to 20 liters of water could be used per day per emplacement just to cool the barrels. The JM mount consisted of a thick, metal, square frame, sized to fit into a standard French fortification embrasure (opening); the guns were mounted on an equally heavy- duty pivoting cradle inside this frame. The square frame fit snugly into the embrasure and was attached by hinges and bolts. This ensured that there were no gaps where enemy bullets could enter into the bunker (except the very small opening that the telescopic sight peeped through), yet allowed the guns to be aimed and trained on anyone outside the walls. Emplacements were often shared with an anti-tank gun sharing the same embrasure opening; the JM mount would be hinged back, and the anti-tank gun slid forward on its ceiling-mounted rail, until its barrel was outside and breech inside. It was surrounded by a similar square frame, which fit tightly into the embrasure. The only time the occupants of the bunker were exposed to enemy fire, was in the brief moments when switching the machine gun mounting for an artillery mount.

Early life Ola Rapace was born on 3 December 1971 in Tyres√∂, Stockholm County, Sweden as P√§r Ola Norell. He grew up mainly in Vallentuna, a middle-class suburb of Stockholm. When he was one year old, his parents separated, and he was raised by his father. He grew up playing football and listening to heavy metal. While studying philosophy at the University of Montpellier in France, he discovered acting. Career His first screen role was in Lukas Moodysson's film Together, a bittersweet comedy about hippie-socialist values set in a Stockholm homeshare commune. The film won several awards at international film festivals, including the Paris Film Festival Special Jury Prize, and Philadelphia Film Festival Jury Award. Rapace's big breakthrough came with the popular TV series Tusenbr√∂der about a group of handymen who become involved with organised crime. Immediately followed the role as Stefan Lindman in Wallander, which was based on Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander books. He continued with several police and crime-related TV series, including portraying Daniel Nordstr√∂m in the Danish police TV show Anna Pihl, Crimes of Passion, a crime drama set in 1950's rural Sweden, Farang about a Scandinavian ex-convict living in Thailand and Hassel, an updated dark and gritty cop show based on a classic series of books from the '70s and '80s. This was a cop show he also executive produced, and Section Z√©ro, a French science fiction influenced cop drama. While he has worked on many cop shows, Rapace has been very critical of the genre. In 2012 he told Cafe Magazine: All the Wallander and Beck films are worthless. There is no credibility, it does not work to investigate thousands of murders in Ystad year after year. In the end it becomes a joke, and the quality becomes so low that one has no other option but to shut down the production. His first English-language film was the 2004 independent movie Rancid starring Matthew Settle (from Band of Brothers and Gossip Girl). A much bigger project was the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall, where he portrayed the hitman \\"Patrice\\". Rapace lived in Paris from 2015-2020 and has since worked on Swedish, French and international projects.

The term was also used in the Methodist churches at one time, but this was discontinued in 1964. Anglican churches In the Episcopal Church, the House of Bishops may, according to canon law, establish a mission in a geographic area that is not already governed by a diocesan bishop or by a church in communion with the Episcopal Church and appoint a missionary bishop to give oversight to that area. The mission may be a joint one with another church.Title 1, Canon 11 Sections 2‚Äì3 p. 44 in text, 35 in pdf. Retrieved March 20, 2007. Historically the title of missionary bishop was often associated with Episcopal Church mission activities in new geographic regions, both domestically and overseas such as in the work of the Protestant Episcopal Church Mission in China in the 19th Century. While missionary bishops usually are assigned to areas within the jurisdiction of the national church, more recently some Anglican provinces have assigned non-geographic missionary bishops within other province's borders to minister to like-minded Anglicans those who are theologically opposed to the bishops under whose geographic jurisdiction they fall. The Church of the Province of Rwanda (as the Anglican Mission in America)Anglican Mission in America and the Church of Nigeria (as CANA, the Convocation of Anglicans in North America)Convocation of Anglicans in North America have assigned missionary bishops to the Episcopal Church primarily over the issues of homosexuality, which the African churches oppose. Methodist churches A missionary bishop was a category of bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, The Methodist Church, and the Free Methodist Church, in use from the late 1800s until 1964. In the Methodist Episcopal Church a missionary bishop was elected for a specified foreign mission field of the church, with full episcopal powers, but with jurisdiction limited to the field for which he was elected. A missionary bishop was not a general superintendent of the church in the same way as a bishop, but neither was he subordinate to the general superintendents (bishops). Rather, missionary bishops collaborated with the bishops in authority in the field to which each was appointed. A missionary bishop was responsible for his conduct to the General Conference, as were bishops. Missionary bishops received their support from the Board of Foreign Missions, rather than from the Annual Conferences (as did the bishops). Missionary bishops were ex officio members of the General Missionary Committee of the church. This use was carried over into The Methodist Church (USA).

In 1984, Debord withdrew his films from circulation because of the negative press and the assassination of his friend and patron Gerard Lebovici. Since Debord's suicide in 1994, Debord's wife Alice Becker-Ho has been promoting Debord's film.

It was the last campaign undertaken by the IDF during the war and its objective was to capture the southern Negev desert, which was claimed by the Kingdom of Jordan to be under Jordanian control in the armistice talks of 1949. The southern Negev was designated to be part of the Jewish State in the 1947 UN Partition Plan. The name uvda (◊¢◊ï◊ë◊ì◊î) is Hebrew for \\"fact\\", referring to the operation's objective to establish de facto Israeli sovereignty over the territory in question, rather than actually conquer it. As such, the Israeli forces did not meet significant resistance on their way. The region claimed during this operations is now referred to as Uvda. The Negev, Golani and Alexandroni brigades participated in the operation, as well as a number of smaller units. Prior reconnaissance In January 1949, slightly over a month before the operation, a small unit was dispatched to reconnoiter the southern Negev, with limited resources and no ability to receive tactical aid. The unit's mission was to map the region, as the best available map of the time was a GSGS map scaled 1:250,000. The unit was reinforced by reconnaissance aircraft and heavy use was made of aerial photography stereoscopic imaging. The unit moved in two parts: one through the center of the Negev and one through the Arava. It was strictly forbidden to engage the Jordanian Arab Legion or enter the Sinai. The unit encountered Bedouins in Ras al-Naqb and immediately set out to return to Beersheba using a different route. As a result, the Arab Legion again manned posts at Ras al-Naqb, which had previously been abandoned. Timeline of the operation 19th Mechanized Battalion of the Golani Brigade during Operation Uvda, March 9, 1949 Yigal Allon and Nahum Spiegel during operation Uvda Ink Flag, right behind the Mall HaYam, Eilat On March 5, 1949, (4 Adar 5709) Negev Brigade forces set out from Beersheba to the Ramon Crater, through Bir 'Asluj. Golani forces simultaneously set out from Mamshit to Ein Husub. On March 6, the Negev Brigade travelled to Sde Avraham and began to clear land for an airfield there. In the night of March 6, 7th Brigade reinforcements from the Gahal platoon arrived by air in the newly cleared airfield. They carried supplies and fuel vital to continue the operation. On March 7, Golani forces conquered the village Ein Harouf. On the same day, the Alexandroni Brigade moved from Beersheba through Mamshit towards Sodom. From there it made an amphibious landing near Ein Gedi through the Dead Sea. On March 8, Golani conquered Ein Ghamr. The defending Jordanian forces withdrew. Simultaneously, Negev forces moved towards Umm Rashrash through the Valley of Fingers. At night, the Alexandroni Brigade set sail from Sodom on the Dead Sea and landed at Ein Gedi before dawn. This was called Operation Itzuv (\\"Stabilization\\"). On March 8‚Äì9, the Alexandroni Brigade split into three groups, one of which captured Ein Gedi and the southern group captured Masada. During that time the Negev Brigade stayed at the Valley of Fingers for two days, looking for a roundabout way to reach Ras al-Naqb. On March 9, Golani forces captured Gharandal and proceeded to Ein Ghadyan (now Yotvata). In the morning of March 10, an aerial photographer discovered that the police station guarding Ras al- Naqb was abandoned. The Negev Brigade set out towards Umm Rashrash through Ras al-Naqb. Negev and Golani Brigades actively competed on who would reach the Red Sea first, and on March 10 at 15:00, the Negev Brigade accomplished the feat, reaching the abandoned police station at Umm Rashrash (where the city of Eilat was later built). The Golani Brigade arrived two hours later. Because Operation Uvda was the last military operation during the war, the raising at the police station of the hand-drawn Israeli flag (popularly known as the Ink Flag) on March 10 at 16:00 is considered to have ended the war. The front commander sent this telegram at the conclusion of the campaign: \\"On Hagana day, the 11th of Adar, the Palmach Negev brigade and the Golani brigade present the Gulf of Eilat to the State of Israel\\".

It contains thirteen non-album singles, fourteen tracks taken from five albums released by the band from 1966 to 1971 (including the UK-only Percy), and one track previously unreleased. Designed specifically for the American market, it peaked at No. 94 on the Billboard 200. The single versions and mixes were not necessarily used for each track. Content After the Kinks failed to renew their American distribution contract with Reprise, the label assembled this compilation without input from the band. Instead, Reprise invited rock journalist and noted Kinks fan John Mendelsohn to compile this package, ignoring the band's early trademark hits already appearing on Greatest Hits!. Mendelsohn also contributed the liner notes. The album contains all five singles that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 during the time period covered, two of which appeared here on album in the U.S. for the first time: \\"Dead End Street\\" and \\"Mr. Pleasant\\". \\"Lola\\" and \\"Apeman\\" were the band's first American top ten hits in over five years. Five tracks made their U.S. debut in any format here ‚Äì \\"Berkeley Mews\\", \\"Willesden Green\\", \\"This Is Where I Belong\\", \\"Did You See His Name?\\" and \\"King Kong\\". The latter two were original to this compilation, and \\"King Kong\\" would be released as Reprise single 1094 two months after the release of this double album. Considered an exemplary compilation, the album was ranked number 232 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, one of the few compilations to appear on the list.

Gordon Murray (1922‚Äì1979) was an American producer, most notable for his redubbing and re-releasing of foreign fairy tale films for U.S. audiences. He is often cited as the \\"King of the Kiddie Matinee.\\" Murray also marketed many of the Mexploitation luchador films, such as Santo films popular in Mexico, changing Santo's name to Samson and dubbing them in English. Among his more famous contributions are Little Red Riding Hood (1960), Little Red Riding Hood and the Monsters (1962), Rumpelstiltskin (1955), The Golden Goose (1964) and Santa Claus (1959), which he also narrated under the pseudonym \\"Ken Smith.\\"  Life  Born in Bloomington, Illinois, where many of the leading circus performers of the time spent their winter seasons, Kenneth 'Kagey' Gordon Murray, son of an Irish-American funeral home director, occasionally spent his boyhood in the company of those struggling artists. By his teenage years, Murray had set up a \\"corn game\\", what would today be known as a bingo parlor, in one of his father's cemetery tents. He then took that corn game out on the road with West's World Wonder Shows Carnival, eventually rising to the position of manager. During the winter season at Bloomington, Murray set up a network of quasi-legal slot machines. By the late 1930s, Murray was using his circus friends' various connections to aid a casting director to hire little people to act as the Munchkins in the 1939 MGM movie, The Wizard of Oz. Shortly afterward, Murray married his longtime sweetheart, Irene, a college graduate from Illinois State University. In 1949, Ken and Irene settled in Hollywood, where Cecil B. DeMille hired Murray to help promote his circus epic, The Greatest Show on Earth. Ultimately, the Murrays moved to Miami, where Murray launched K. Gordon Murray Productions, making several deals with such top pioneers in exploitation filmmaking as Kroger Babb. He often changed the titles of his movies, giving them more sensational and more emotionally charged monikers, in order to sell them in a better way. The movie Santa Claus made so much money, that it is the only film in U.S. history (with the possible exception of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) to be released profitably in theaters every few years for three decades. When Murray saw this, he started to dub more children's fairy tale films into English, and by the end of the 1960s, he had been hailed by film critics as the \\"King of the Kiddie Matinee\\". To promote these films, he hired a local costume shop to create costumes for his two leading mascots: Stinky the Skunk and the Ferocious Wolf, both of whom appeared in a series of films based on the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Murray released over 60 movies in 15 years. Toward the end of his life, Murray ran afoul of the Internal Revenue Service, which seized his films and took them out of circulation. But on December 30, 1979, before he could take the IRS to court to reclaim his movies, Murray suffered a fatal heart attack at the age of 57.  Popular culture  One episode of the show This Movie Sucks! was dedicated to a double feature of two of Murray's films, The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy and Swamp of the Lost Souls. In the episode, the edited down (and sometimes sped up) versions of the movies were made fun of by host Ed the Sock, Liana K and Ron Sparks, with special guest Bandito, who Liana dressed up like the robot from the first movie. Three of his films were featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy in the first season, Santa Claus in the fifth season, and Samson vs. the Vampire Women in the sixth season. Additionally, The Brainiac appeared as an offering of RiffTrax, a movie-riffing service run by several MST3K alumni; a trio of Murray shorts were released as the DVD/VOD \\"Santa's Village of Madness\\".

Kennedy as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, 1961‚Äì64. Life and career Heller was born in Buffalo, New York, to German immigrants, Gertrude (Warmburg) and Ernst Heller, a civil engineer.http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.0700511 After attending Shorewood High School in Shorewood, Wisconsin, he entered Oberlin College in 1931, graduating with a B.A. degree in 1935. Heller received his masters and doctorate degrees in economics from the University of Wisconsin.\\"Shorewood School District to honor alumni, ex-teachers\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 7, 2003. Accessed September 17, 2007. \\"The other honorees are Walter Heller (class of '31), an economic adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and a professor at the University of Michigan...\\" As a Keynesian, he promoted cuts in the marginal federal income tax rates. This tax cut, which was passed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and Congress after Kennedy's death, was credited for boosting the U.S. economy. Heller developed the first \\"voluntary\\" wage-price guidelines. When the steel industry failed to follow them, it was publicly attacked by Kennedy and quickly complied. Heller was one of the first to emphasize that tax deductions and tax preferences narrowed the income tax base, thus requiring, for a given amount of revenue, higher marginal tax rates. The historic tax cut and its positive effect on the economy has often been cited as motivation for more recent tax cuts by Republicans. The day after Kennedy was assassinated, Heller met with President Johnson in the Oval Office. To get the country going again, Heller suggested a major initiative he called the \\"War on Poverty\\", which Johnson adopted enthusiastically. Later, when Johnson insisted on escalating the Vietnam War without raising taxes, setting the stage for an inflationary spiral, Heller resigned. In the early phases of his career, Heller contributed to the creation of the Marshall Plan of 1947, and was instrumental in re-establishing the German currency following World War II, which helped usher an economic boom in West Germany. Heller was critical of Milton Friedman's followers and labelled them cultish: \\"Some of them are Friedmanly, some Friedmanian, some Friedmanesque, some Friedmanic and some Friedmaniacs.\\"Memorandum to William Carmichael as quoted on page 206 of Valdes, Pinochet's Economists. Heller joined the University of Minnesota faculty as an associate professor of economics in 1945, left for a few years to serve in government, and returned in the 1960s, eventually serving as chair of the Department of Economics. He built it into a top-ranked department with spectacular hires, including future Nobel Prize winners Leonid Hurwicz (2007), Edward C. Prescott (2004), Thomas J. Sargent (2011) and Christopher A. Sims (2011). Douglas Clement, \\"A Golden History\\", College of Liberal Arts, University of Minnesota Heller died in Silverdale, Washington on June 15, 1987 at the age of 71.

In the controlled demolition industry, building implosion is the strategic placing of explosive material and timing of its detonation so that a structure collapses on itself in a matter of seconds, minimizing the physical damage to its immediate surroundings. Despite its terminology, building implosion also includes the controlled demolition of other structures, such as bridges, smokestacks, towers, and tunnels. Building implosion, which reduces to seconds a process which could take months or years to achieve by other methods, typically occurs in urban areas and often involves large landmark structures. The actual use of the term \\"implosion\\" to refer to the destruction of a building is a misnomer. This had been stated of the destruction of 1515 Tower in West Palm Beach, Florida. \\"What happens is, you use explosive materials in critical structural connections to allow gravity to bring it down.\\" Terminology Implosion of Radio Network House, damaged by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, in the Christchurch Central City The term building implosion can be misleading to laymen: The technique is not a true implosion phenomenon. A true implosion usually involves a difference between internal (lower) and external (higher) pressure, or inward and outward forces, that is so large that the structure collapses inward into itself. In contrast, building implosion techniques do not rely on the difference between internal and external pressure to collapse a structure. Instead, the goal is to induce a progressive collapse by weakening or removing critical supports, therefore the building can no longer withstand gravity loads and will fail under its own weight. Numerous small explosives, strategically placed within the structure, are used to catalyze the collapse. Nitroglycerin, dynamite, or other explosives are used to shatter reinforced concrete supports. Linear shaped charges are used to sever steel supports. These explosives are progressively detonated on supports throughout the structure. Then, explosives on the lower floors initiate the controlled collapse. A simple structure like a chimney can be prepared for demolition in less than a day. Larger or more complex structures can take up to six months of preparation to remove internal walls and wrap columns with fabric and fencing before firing the explosives. Historical overview Demolition by controlled explosion in Buffalo, New York The demolition of the New Haven Coliseum in New Haven, Connecticut As part of the demolition industry, the history of building implosion is tied to the development of explosives technology. One of the earliest documented attempts at building implosion was the 1773 razing of Holy Trinity Cathedral in Waterford, Ireland with of gunpowder, a huge amount of explosives at the time. The use of low velocity explosive produced a deafening explosion that instantly reduced the building to rubble. The late 19th century saw the erection of‚Äîand ultimately the need to demolish‚Äîthe first skyscrapers, which had more complicated structures, allowing greater heights. This led to other considerations in the explosive demolition of buildings, such as worker and spectator safety and limiting collateral damage. Benefiting from the availability of dynamite, a high- velocity explosive based on a stabilized form of nitroglycerine, and borrowing from techniques used in rock-blasting, such as staggered detonation of several small charges, building demolition edged toward efficient building implosion. Following World War II, European demolition experts, faced with huge reconstruction projects in dense urban areas, gathered practical knowledge and experience for bringing down large structures without harming adjacent properties. This led to the emergence of a demolition industry that grew and matured during the latter half of the twentieth century. At the same time, the development of more efficient high-velocity explosives, such as RDX, and non- electrical firing systems combined to make this a period of time in which the building implosion technique was extensively used. Meanwhile, public interest in the spectacle of controlled building explosion also grew. The October 1994 demolition of the Sears Merchandise Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania drew a cheering crowd of 50,000, as well as protesters, bands, and street vendors hawking building implosion memorabilia. Evolution in the mastery of controlled demolition led to the world record demolition of the Seattle Kingdome on March 26, 2000. In 1997, the Royal Canberra Hospital implosion in Canberra, Australia experienced disaster. The main building did not fully disintegrate and had to be manually demolished. Far worse, the explosion was not contained on the site and large pieces of debris were projected towards spectators away, in a location considered safe for viewing. A twelve-year-old girl was killed instantly, and nine others were injured. Large fragments of masonry and metal were found from the demolition site. On October 24, 1998, the J. L. Hudson Department Store and Addition in Detroit, Michigan became the tallest, and the largest, building ever imploded. On December 13, 2009, an unfinished 31-story condominium tower, known as the Ocean Tower, was imploded in South Padre Island, Texas. Construction on the new tower had begun in 2006, but it had been sinking unevenly during construction, halted in 2008, and could not be saved. It is believed to be one of the tallest reinforced concrete structures ever imploded.Ocean Tower implodes into pile of rubble - The Brownsville Herald, December 14, 2009.

He was Federal Minister of Transport for 17 years and the fourth Vice Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1966. Life Seebohm attended school in Dresden, Saxony and studied mining at the universities of Munich and Berlin-Charlottenburg. Passing the Staatsexamen in 1928, he worked as a junior civil servant at Halle and obtained a doctorate level degree from the Technical College of Berlin in 1932. He became a mining director at Silesian Gleiwitz and Bytom and upon the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938/39 supervised the \\"Aryanization\\" of the mines at Kr√°lovsk√© Po≈ô√≠ƒç√≠ (K√∂nigswerth). After World War II, he joined the regionalist Lower Saxon State Party in the British occupation zone under Heinrich Hellwege, which in 1947 was renamed German Party (DP). Seebohm became president of the chamber of commerce at Braunschweig and was a member of the Landtag state assembly of Lower Saxony from 1946 until 1951. From 1946 until 1948 he held the office of Minister for Reconstruction, Labour and Health in Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf's Lower Saxon state government. In the run-up to the first federal election of 1949, he and his party fellows Hellwege and von Merkatz negotiated a national conservative alliance with the Deutsche Rechtspartei and Hessian National Democrats, which however were aborted by the British occupation forces. In 1952, Seebohm was elected DP chairman, but refused to assume office. Minister for Transport From 1949 until his death he was a member of the Bundestag for the constituency of Hamburg- Harburg. From 20 September 1949 until 30 November 1966 he also served as Federal Minister for Transport, firstly under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who forced him to join the CDU in 1960 as he wouldn't support the DP any longer; then under Ludwig Erhard, under whom he ultimately, but briefly, served as Vice-Chancellor. Seebohm was a firm supporter of the Bundesbahn, and went to some length to hamstring the trucking industry. In April 1953, second trailers were prohibited. In 1954 a law was passed dictating that half of all transports in Germany had to be carried by train; this would be promoted by subventioning rates for train transports. Trucking remained popular, however, due to its higher flexibility.Gr√§f, p. 8 Thus, in 1956, the rules were tightened yet more: Sunday truck traffic was prohibited, along with a host of other new restrictions. Trucks were restricted to a GVW, with a maximum axle load of , and a maximum overall length of .Gr√§f, p. 10 A minimum power-to- weight requirement of 6 PS/tonne (max 373 lb/hp) was instituted. These various restrictions forced truck manufacturers to develop entirely new trucks meeting the ever tightening requirements, and had a detrimental effect on exports. In 1960 an easing of the restrictions was announced; railroad and trucking transport were now working in conjunction. Paradoxically, meeting the tough restrictions had forced the German trucking industry to become lean and innovative, leaving them in a much stronger position than before Seebohm's programs.Gr√§f, p. 15 When the 1966 grand coalition under Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger took office, he left the cabinet, having served as a federal minister for seventeen years, a record beaten only by Foreign Minister Hans- Dietrich Genscher's 23 years (with an interruption in 1982) but as of 2011 still the record for uninterrupted service. Spokesperson for the Sudeten Germans From 1959 Seebohm acted as spokesperson of the Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft (Sudeten German Homeland Association) of German expellees from Czechoslovakia, where he held his so-called \\"weekend speeches\\". In line with West German government policy at the time, he questioned the borders of Germany, referring to the borders of the 1937 German Reich as base of any border revision and stating that Germans should also never forget about the eastern territories lost after World War I according to the resolutions of the Treaty of Versailles, while at the same time even demanding restoration of the 1938 Munich Agreement. Seebohm died a few months after his retirement and is buried in the Bad Pyrmont cemetery.

Club career A trainee of both Sevilla FC (early) and FC Barcelona (with whom he featured in a UEFA Champions League game, against Club Brugge KV), S√°nchez was born in Seville, Andalusia, and he made his debut in La Liga with Albacete Balompi√© in 2003‚Äì04. On 19 October 2003, after a team effort, he scored from a lob in a 3‚Äì1 home win over Real Sociedad ‚Äì his only goal of the season. S√°nchez spent the second half of the 2004‚Äì05 campaign in the second division, loaned to Deportivo Alav√©s, and appeared rarely as the Basques returned to the top flight. He then completed another two solid years with Albacete. In July 2007, S√°nchez moved to Gimn√†stic de Tarragona in the second level. Scarcely used, he joined Romania's FC Timi≈üoara at the end of the season, being loaned to FC Gloria BuzƒÉu in January 2009 and being released in July after only 12 appearances for both clubs combined. After spending the first months of the new campaign training on his own, S√°nchez moved in January 2010 to CD Castell√≥n of division two, making no appearances as the Valencian team also suffered relegation. In August, he signed with another side in that tier, Elche CF. S√°nchez left the club at the end of 2010‚Äì11, amid rumours that he had sold out to Granada CF during the top division promotion play-offs. Shortly after, however, he signed for CD Atl√©tico Baleares in the third division. On 13 July 2013, S√°nchez returned to Gimn√†stic, now in the third tier of Spanish football. On 23 July of the following year, he moved to UD Melilla in the same division. S√°nchez continued to compete in the lower leagues or amateur football until his retirement at the age of 37, representing in the process C√°diz CF, Atl√©tico Baleares, Real Murcia and Orihuela CF. On 4 July 2019, he was appointed manager of Murcia's under-17 squad as well as part of the club's technical secretariat.

Baker Sr. (April 19, 1934 ‚Äì October 20, 2014) was an American professional wrestler and actor, better known professionally as Ox Baker. He was famous for his Machiavellian eyebrows and finishing move, the Heart Punch, sometimes called the \\"Hurt Punch\\", after Baker's famous catchphrase \\"I love to hurt people!\\". He appeared in several movies including Blood Circus and Escape from New York. Early life Baker, the oldest of five siblings, began as an amateur high school wrestler, boxer and football player in his adopted hometown of Waterloo, Iowa before getting thrown out of school. He also played football for two years in the armed forces. Professional wrestling career Baker was trained by Buddy Austin, Pat O'Connor, and Bob Geigel, and debuted in 1964. As time went on he was winning a majority of his matches by knock out caused by the Heart Punch; he later renamed the move the Hurt Punch when Stan Stasiak, from whom Baker adopted the move, objected. Initially debuting as a kind, horn-rimmed-glasses-wearing country simpleton, Baker later turned into a villain. He was known for his unique look with his shaved head and black bushy mustache and eyebrows and ability to cut a promo. He was also famous for wearing T-shirts to the ring, declaring himself \\"The Great Heart Puncher\\". In 1967 Baker worked for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) as The Friendly Arkansas Ox. In his first appearance there, Baker teamed with Armand Hussein in a handicap match versus Gorilla Monsoon. Later on Baker went to fight in different promotions through North America, including Stampede Wrestling in Canada, the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico, and the United States-based American Wrestling Association throughout the 1970s. On June 13, 1971, Baker and his partner the Claw were wrestling in an AWA Midwest Tag Team Championship tag team match against Alberto Torres and ‚ÄúCowboy‚Äù Bob Ellis in Verdigre, Nebraska. Torres was injured during the match and died three days later. Though evidence indicated that Torres died of a ruptured appendix, Baker's Heart Punch was blamed; the death was worked into Baker's wrestling persona, reinforcing his heel character. On August 1, 1972, Baker lost to Ray Gunkel. Following the match, Gunkel died in the locker room; his death was attributed to a blood clot, which broke off from a hematoma caused by Baker, which led to a heart attack. Again, the death was worked into Baker's character, and in 1974, Baker caused a riot in Cleveland, Ohio, for continually Heart Punching his opponent Ernie Ladd after the match was finished. During his career he defeated \\"Cowboy\\" Bob Ellis for the World Wrestling Association's World Heavyweight Championship in Indianapolis and Carlos Colon for the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. Baker beat The Sheik to win the Detroit version of the US Heavyweight title; he also won the NWA American Heavyweight Championship and the NWA Texas Heavyweight title several times. In addition, Baker was a multi-time tag team champion; he teamed with Ole Anderson and Skandor Akbar to capture tag team championships in the National Wrestling Alliance and National Wrestling Federation. Baker teamed with Chuck O'Connor to win the WWA World Tag Team Championship in 1976. He also teamed with Superstar Billy Graham to hold the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. He is noted for a feud with Randy Savage in International Championship Wrestling, the southern promotion that Savage ran with his father Angelo Poffo and his brother Lanny Poffo. Late in his career, Baker appeared with Central States Wrestling as a face and feuded with Rip Rogers. In 1988, Baker returned to the AWA. Under contract with The AWA through TRB Sports LLC, Baker teamed up with George Petraski, The Russian Brute, of ICW fame. The following year he opened \\"Ox Baker's Wrestling School\\", becoming a well-renowned trainer. His students include Mark Calaway, Bryan Clark. and NWA New England Superstar The Dark Angel and his Kayfabe twin brother Micky Byggs of Wrestling Spotlite Radio/TV. He also did commentary for some IWCCW events in the early 1990s. Baker made an appearance in Ring of Honor in 2004 during their At Our Best event, confronting Dusty Rhodes before the show started and again during the main event that Rhodes was involved in. Baker also made an appearance in Combat Zone Wrestling on December 8, 2007, at Cage of Death 9 as the guest of Cult Fiction (Halfbreed Billy Gram and Toby Klein). In December 2013, Baker returned to the ring to be crowned the CCW Champion after being a surprise entrant in a thirteen-man battle royal in Ohio. Acting career and other media Baker with a fan Baker worked in movies from time to time, most notably in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He appeared as a fighter in Jackie Chan's The Big Brawl (1980) and as Kurt Russell's gladiatorial opponent in John Carpenter's Escape from New York (1981). In addition, he was cast in the professional wrestling film named for his catch phrase, I Like to Hurt People. On January 19, 1981, Baker was a contestant on the game show The Price is Right. In 1985, Ox Baker played the Russian in the wrestling movie Blood Circus, and in 2013 appeared in Chilling Visions: 5 Senses of Fear as The Butcher. In 2005 a documentary on Baker's life and career was filmed, directed by Halfbreed Billy Gram, with the working title of I Love the People I Hurt: The Life and Legend of the Mighty Ox Baker. Also filmed during this time was a short comedy feature titled My Smorgasboard with Ox, co-written and co- starring Baker and Gram. Both remain in post-production. In 2006 the North Carolina-based indie band the Mountain Goats released a song on their Babylon Springs EP titled \\"Ox Baker Triumphant\\" in which Baker is betrayed by the wrestling community and rises up to strike vengeance upon them.

He lived in the Netherlands in the 1970s where he received a Dutch stipend. There he came into more direct contact with the international avant-garde.

Cricket career A right-handed opening batsman, Briers was Leicestershire's youngest-ever first-class cricketer when he made his debut at 16 in 1971, but it was for his deeds towards the end of his career that he won accolades. The accolades, though, related not just to his longevity as batman but also to his captaincy. Appointed to succeed David Gower in charge of an under-achieving team in 1990, Briers brought a touch of school-masterly discipline to the team that paid off in terms of results and earned the loyal respect of his team. In 1992, though finishing only halfway up the County Championship table, Leicestershire spent much of the summer challenging for the leadership, and also went to their first-ever Gillette Cup final, the last of the 17 counties that were first-class when the competition started in 1963 to make an appearance in the final. Briers was rewarded by being named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1993 edition of the almanack. Leicestershire and Briers continued to do well for the next three seasons, and Briers stepped down from the captaincy at the end of the 1995 season, intending to continue playing as a batsman for a further season at least. But a knee injury, followed by an operation, left him as a spectator as the county, under new captain James Whitaker, took their second Championship title in 1996, and he never played first-class cricket again.

Outside the orbit of Jupiter, solar radiation is too weak to produce sufficient power within current solar technology and spacecraft mass limitations, so radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are instead used as a power source.NASA JPL Publication: Basics of Space Flight, Chapter 11. Typical Onboard Systems , Electrical Power Supply and Distribution Subsystems,  History  The first spacecraft to use solar panels was the Vanguard 1 satellite, launched by the US in 1958. This was largely because of the influence of Dr. Hans Ziegler, who can be regarded as the father of spacecraft solar power. The satellite was powered by silicon solar cells with ‚âà10% conversion efficiency.  Uses  The solar panels on the SMM satellite provided electrical power. Here it is being captured by an astronaut in a mobile space-suit that runs on chemical battery power. Solar panels on spacecraft supply power for two main uses: * Power to run the sensors, active heating, cooling and telemetry. * Power for spacecraft propulsion ‚Äì electric propulsion, sometimes called solar-electric propulsion.NASA JPL Publication: Basics of Space Flight, Chapter 11. Typical Onboard Systems, Propulsion Subsystems, http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-4.html#propulsion For both uses, a key figure of merit of the solar panels is the specific power (watts generated divided by solar array mass), which indicates on a relative basis how much power one array will generate for a given launch mass relative to another. Another key metric is stowed packing efficiency (deployed watts produced divided by stowed volume), which indicates how easily the array will fit into a launch vehicle. Yet another key metric is cost (dollars per watt). To increase the specific power, typical solar panels on spacecraft use close- packed solar cell rectangles that cover nearly 100% of the Sun-visible area of the solar panels, rather than the solar wafer circles which, even though close-packed, cover about 90% of the Sun-visible area of typical solar panels on Earth. However, some solar panels on spacecraft have solar cells that cover only 30% of the Sun-visible area.  Implementation  Spacecraft Bus on the planned James Webb Space Telescope, which is powered by solar panels (coloured green in this 3/4 view). Note that shorter light purple extensions are radiator shades not solar panels. Solar panels need to have a lot of surface area that can be pointed towards the Sun as the spacecraft moves. More exposed surface area means more electricity can be converted from light energy from the Sun. Since spacecraft have to be small, this limits the amount of power that can be produced. All electrical circuits generate waste heat; in addition, solar arrays act as optical and thermal as well as electrical collectors. Heat must be radiated from their surfaces. High-power spacecraft may have solar arrays that compete with the active payload itself for thermal dissipation. The innermost panel of arrays may be \\"blank\\" to reduce the overlap of views to space. Such spacecraft include the higher-power communications satellites (e.g., later-generation TDRS) and Venus Express, not high-powered but closer to the Sun. Spacecraft are built so that the solar panels can be pivoted as the spacecraft moves. Thus, they can always stay in the direct path of the light rays no matter how the spacecraft is pointed. Spacecraft are usually designed with solar panels that can always be pointed at the Sun, even as the rest of the body of the spacecraft moves around, much as a tank turret can be aimed independently of where the tank is going. A tracking mechanism is often incorporated into the solar arrays to keep the array pointed towards the sun. Sometimes, satellite operators purposefully orient the solar panels to \\"off point,\\" or out of direct alignment from the Sun. This happens if the batteries are completely charged and the amount of electricity needed is lower than the amount of electricity made; off-pointing is also sometimes used on the International Space Station for orbital drag reduction.  Ionizing radiation issues and mitigation  Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter and the first solar-powered craft to do so. Space contains varying levels of electromagnetic radiation as well as ionizing radiation. There are 4 sources of radiations: the Earth's radiation belts (also called Van Allen belts), galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar wind and solar flares. The Van Allen belts and the solar wind contain mostly protons and electrons, while GCR are in majority very high energy protons, alpha particles and heavier ions. Solar panels will experience efficiency degradation over time as a result of these types of radiation, but the degradation rate will depend strongly on the solar cell technology and on the location of the spacecraft. With borosilicate glass panel coverings, this may be between 5-10% efficiency loss per year. Other glass coverings, such as fused silica and lead glasses, may reduce this efficiency loss to less than 1% per year. The degradation rate is a function of the differential flux spectrum and the total ionizing dose.  Types of solar cells typically used  Up until the early 1990s, solar arrays used in space primarily used crystalline silicon solar cells. Since the early 1990s, Gallium arsenide-based solar cells became favored over silicon because they have a higher efficiency and degrade more slowly than silicon in the space radiation environment. The most efficient solar cells currently in production are now multi-junction photovoltaic cells. These use a combination of several layers of indium gallium phosphide, gallium arsenide and germanium to harvest more energy from the solar spectrum. Leading edge multi-junction cells are capable of exceeding 39.2% under non-concentrated AM1.5G illumination and 47.1% using concentrated AM1.5G illumination.Solar cell efficiency  Spacecraft that have used solar power  Solar panels extended out from the Apollo Telescope Mount, power solar observatory instruments on the Skylab station, which also had an additional array on the main spacecraft To date, solar power, other than for propulsion, has been practical for spacecraft operating no farther from the Sun than the orbit of Jupiter. For example, Juno, Magellan, Mars Global Surveyor, and Mars Observer used solar power as does the Earth-orbiting, Hubble Space Telescope. The Rosetta space probe, launched 2 March 2004, used its of solar panels as far as the orbit of Jupiter (5.25 AU); previously the furthest use was the Stardust spacecraft at 2 AU. Solar power for propulsion was also used on the European lunar mission SMART-1 with a Hall effect thruster. The Juno mission, launched in 2011, is the first mission to Jupiter (arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016) to use solar panels instead of the traditional RTGs that are used by previous outer Solar System missions, making it the furthest spacecraft to use solar panels to date.Juno mission page at NASA's New Frontiers Web Site . Retrieved 2007-08-31.Jet Propulsion Laboratory: NASA's Juno Spacecraft Breaks Solar Power Distance Record. January 13, 2016. Retrieved July 12, 2016. It has of panels. Another spacecraft of interest is Dawn which went into orbit around 4 Vesta in 2011. It used ion thrusters to get to Ceres. The potential for solar powered spacecraft beyond Jupiter has been studied.Scott W. Benson ‚Äì Solar Power for Outer Planets Study (2007) ‚Äì NASA Glenn Research Center The International Space Station also uses solar arrays to power everything on the station. The 262,400 solar cells cover around of space. There are four sets of solar arrays that power the station and the fourth set of arrays were installed in March 2009. 240 kilowatts of electricity can be generated from these solar arrays. That comes to 120 kilowatts average system power, including 50% ISS time in Earth's shadow.  Future uses  Flexible solar arrays are being investigated for use in space. The Roll Out Solar Array (ROSA) was deployed on the International Space Station in July 2017. For future missions, it is desirable to reduce solar array mass, and to increase the power generated per unit area. This will reduce overall spacecraft mass, and may make the operation of solar-powered spacecraft feasible at larger distances from the sun. Solar array mass could be reduced with thin-film photovoltaic cells, flexible blanket substrates, and composite support structures. Solar array efficiency could be improved by using new photovoltaic cell materials and solar concentrators that intensify the incident sunlight. Photovoltaic concentrator solar arrays for primary spacecraft power are devices which intensify the sunlight on the photovoltaics. This design uses a flat lens, called a Fresnel lens, which takes a large area of sunlight and concentrates it onto a smaller spot, allowing a smaller area of solar cell to be used. Solar concentrators put one of these lenses over every solar cell. This focuses light from the large concentrator area down to the smaller cell area. This allows the quantity of expensive solar cells to be reduced by the amount of concentration. Concentrators work best when there is a single source of light and the concentrator can be pointed right at it. This is ideal in space, where the Sun is a single light source. Solar cells are the most expensive part of solar arrays, and arrays are often a very expensive part of the spacecraft. This technology may allow costs to be cut significantly due to the utilization of less material.

Accessed 04.02.2015. After his graduation Mackenzie started his academic career in 1964 at the Carnegie-Mellon University as Assistant Professor of Economics. In 1967 he moved to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1972 he moved to the University of Kansas, where he was appointed Edmund P. Learned Distinguished Professor from January 1972 to January 2006. He further taught at U.C. Berkeley, University of Waterloo, and KU. In 2000 Mackenzie founded the consultancy firm EMAC Assessments, LLC. Mackenzie has served on numerous editorial boards including Management Science, Organizational studies, International Journal of Organizational Analysis, Journal of Management Inquiry, Human Systems Management, and Engineering Management Research.'' He has published 19 books and over 100 articles.  Work  Mackenzie research interests have been in the fields of organization theories, organization design processual models, organizational leadership, multi-level research and the discoverer of the organizational hologram.  Approach to Research  Mackenzie's research is based on his bed rock belief that there are only three fates of any theory: to be (a) ignored, (b) rejected, and (c) revised. Consequently, it is self- evident and unreasonable for him to expect any of his theories to escape these fates. Therefore, he is not interested in \\"proving\\" or justifying them. He knows that they somehow must be wrong. What he chooses to publish is his current best effort but only after finally failing to find grievous fault. The goal is to improve theories rather than to defend them. The best way to do this is to actively search for and highlight hidden flaws and inconsistencies. Finding these flaws provides vital clues for making improvements in the theory. Fixing them paves the path to improvements. To this end, Mackenzie never begins any research project if he already has a clear understanding of how to solve it. What would be the point? In fact he only works on projects for which he does not know the results. This way he is frequently surprised and grateful to witness new wonders. Surprises refocus thinking and provide information about how one of his theories is wrong. Surprise stimulates the necessity for more improvements. The constant goal is seeking disconfirmations. The motto is \\"Always Failing Forward!\\" Obtaining a confirmation adds no new information, does nothing to improve a theory, and uses up scarce resources. Confirming what is already known is thus viewed as an ineffective strategy for theory improvement. But a disconfirmation is a stimulus, a call to action which impels one to stumble forward in order to seek improvements. One succeeds by failing. Mackenzie is keenly interested in discovering and enhancing explanations of patterned behavior. Thus, he values theory. He is especially interested in the patterns of behavior within groups and organizations. His approach to research is both deliberate and na√Øve. There are steps he follows in performing an empirical or conceptual study. However, he tries to ignore any latent preconceived specific theory or a fixed toolkit of methods. To him the phenomena is paramount and not the literature. He always wants a fresh, independent look at a problem whenever possible. The first step is to \\"wallow\\" in the phenomena until reaching an intuitive feel for them. (Please note: to wallow in the phenomena is not the same thing as wallowing in the literature about the phenomena). Next is the effort to formulate the research questions, taking care to always to be \\"anchored\\" in the phenomena. This formulation provides a narrative and means to begin the development of some explanation for the phenomena. Once an explanation is developed, the question becomes: how can this be refuted? The next step is to refute it. This is the easiest step! This basic research process iterates until one runs out of new ideas for refuting the explanation. Stopping to write up results is the next step. These developments are merged into a wider stream of his past research work and where feasible, the relevant literatures. Because of the importance he places on counterexamples, he eschews the use of mathematical statistics in favor of strong inference. His purpose is to use each research adventure to help erect a less ramshackle theoretical edifice for the group and organizational sciences. He usually works on many questions simultaneously and moves quickly to reject unpromising avenues of research. He strives to avoid the Type III error of working on the wrong problem. Ideas pop up all over and the trick to give each a chance and then discard the bad ones. In the pungent language of hunters, \\"do not feed the dog that won‚Äôt hunt.\\" Mackenzie sometimes works as a management consultant in order to hear of new problems and thus new questions and to fund his research. However, he never accepts a consulting project if he thinks that he already knows the answer. He does not offer recommendations for organizational changes unless the client agrees he knows enough to run the organization. He is always an advocate for the well-being of the organization itself.  Representing Group and Organizational Structures and Processes  As a researcher, a teacher, an author, and an editor, he frequently encounters the difficulty of how to represent fundamental concepts such as leadership, structure, and process. In particular, the representations of structure and group and organizational processes are especially interesting and important because they cut across the group and organizational sciences. In this regard, he has learned two things worth mentioning produced over a course of many years of research into organizational phenomena: the representation of group and organizational (a) structures and (b) processes. Both concepts are central to discussions of group and organizational processes (GOPs). And neither is represented consistently among scholars and practitioners. The result is confusion and barriers to cumulation. For how can one build on another's results when the other's methods and concepts are inconsistent with one's own?  Representing Group and Organizational Structures  A structure, Sn, of a group or organization of n agents, Xn = (x1, x2, ..., xi, ..., xn) can be represented by this equation: ::Sn = (Xn; R) (Equation 1) where the matrix R has n rows and n columns and entries rij where row i corresponds to the \\"sender,\\" xi , the column j corresponds to the \\"receiver,\\" xj , and the value of an entry rij is a measure of an interaction from xi to xj. The value of rij can range from a binary relation such as a boss-subordinate to how many thousands of board feet of douglas fir, 4-side finished, eight foot 2 x 4's were sold by wholesaler i to retailer j during a specified time period. The xi œµ X are engaged Processual Agents such as individuals, groups (e.g. committees, task forces, virtual teams, etc.), and even organizations. The dimension and measures for the entries, rij , are chosen for the purposes of an analysis. It is important to realize that in this representation of group and organizational structures, the entries rij reflect the actual relationship between its members relevant to the purposes of the study. Please note the asymmetry: rij rarely equals rji . Also, in some applications, not all of the Processual Agents xi œµ X are, in fact, human. Given this representation of group and organizational structures, the following conclusions have strong empirical support: #Structures are more accurately viewed as effects rather than causes of behavior. #Different tasks may have different structures. #Groups and organizations have multiple structures. #These structures are interdependent. #Structures can and do change. #A structure represents a need satisfying interaction pattern. As needs change, so will the structures to satisfy them as long as there is net benefit for the change. #These structural change processes can be modeled and explained. #Most group and organizational behavior takes place \\"outside\\" of the formal lines of authority. Departures from the organizational chart are normal. #Processes and their structures are independent.  Representing Group and Organizational Processes  Any group and organizational process (GOP) can be represented as: ::Y = F(C) (Equation 2) where C is a vector of considerations or steps in a GOP, F is a network illustrating the linkages between each of the considerations or steps, and Y is the set of outcomes of the GOP. Intuitively, a GOP is a time dependent sequence of behaviors governed by a process framework given by equation (2). The GOP representation of equation (2) is derived from these six ontological axioms: #A GOP involves one or more processual agents. #A GOP involves two or more linked process elements. #A GOP is not random. #A GOP is linked to at least one other GOP. #A GOP representation requires process resources and involves their characteristics-in-use. #A GOP has more than one level.

The site is divided into two separately- managed stations, Heysham 1 and Heysham 2, both with two reactors of the advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) type. In 2010, the British government announced that Heysham was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. On 1 August 2016, Heysham 2's Unit 8 broke the world record for longest continuous operation of a nuclear generator without a shutdown. This record-breaking run exceeds the previous record of 894 days set by Pickering Nuclear Generating Station's Unit 7 (Lake Ontario, Canada) in 1994.British reactor takes record for longest continuous operation, World Nuclear News, August 2, 2016. The reactor has generated 13.5 TWh of electricity so far during this continuous operation, taking its lifetime generation to 115.46 TWh. Heysham 1 Construction of Heysham 1, which was undertaken by British Nuclear Design & Construction (BNDC), a consortium backed by English Electric, Babcock & Wilcox and Taylor Woodrow Construction,The UK Magnox and AGR Power Station Projects began in 1970, with the first reactor commencing operations in 1983 and the second reactor following in 1984. However, initial production levels were low, and full commercial operation was only declared in 1989. It is likely to remain in operation until 2024. Its generating capacity is 1150 MWe. The reactors were supplied by National Nuclear Corporation and the turbines by GEC. There were 4 √ó 17.5 MW auxiliary gas turbines on the site, these had been first commissioned in January 1977. Heysham 1 shares its reactor design with Hartlepool nuclear power station, which introduced the replaceable pod boiler design. The CEGB specified a compact design for the Heysham 1 and Hartlepool power station reactor islands in comparison to the design of the two preceding stations at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B in order to reduce the capital cost, but this caused expensive construction delays because of restricted access. The Heysham 2 reactor island occupies a much larger footprint than Heysham 1 for a similar design output of power. In 2013 a defect was found by a regular inspection in one of the eight pod boilers of unit 1. The reactor resumed operation at a lower output level with the defective pod boiler disabled, until June 2014 when more detailed inspections confirmed a crack in the boiler spine. As a precaution, unit 2 and the sister Hartlepool nuclear power station were also shut down for inspection. All units have since returned to full power after successful inspections on the three other reactors revealed no other defects. Heysham 1 unit 1 will operate on 7 out of the 8 boiler pods until a detailed repair strategy has been developed. Heysham 2 The construction, which was undertaken by a consortium known as National Nuclear Corporation (NNC), began in 1979 and the station opened in 1988. Its generating capacity is 1250 MWe, and it is estimated to keep running until at least 2030. Heysham 2 shares its reactor design with Torness nuclear power station near Dunbar in East Lothian, and is a development of the reactor design used at Hinkley Point B in Somerset. The reactors were supplied by NNC, the turbines and boilers by NEI. On 15 August 2019, Reactor 8 inside Heysham 2 let off a large amount of steam, with banging noises at approximately 11pm that could be heard 7 miles away in Lancaster. This caused alarm among local residents, and numerous calls to the police reporting ‚Äúgunshots‚Äù. EDF later reported that a reactor had earlier experienced a \\"non-planned shutdown after an electrical fault\\", and the noise was from the re-start process.

Early life  Kim was born in Seoul, Korea in 1935. During the Korean War he became a Christian. Then, while working for a United States Marine Corps Chaplain as an interpreter, translating sermons before Korean audiences, he decided to enter into ministry. He was 17 years old. Kim is married to Wha-Sei P. Kim (Î∞ïÌôîÏÑ∏). They have three children: Eugene (ÍπÄÏú†ÏßÑ), Eusun (ÍπÄÏú†ÏÑ†), and Eumi (ÍπÄÏú†ÎØ∏).  Education  Kim went to the Methodist Theological Seminary in Seoul, and upon completing study there came to the United States to pursue further education. He graduated in 1964 with an M.Div. degree from the Methodist Theological School in Ohio. He continued graduate study at Drew Theological Seminary.  Ordained ministry  He also began pastoral ministry in 1964, serving various types of churches in the Northern New Jersey Annual Conference of the Methodist Church, including a Korean church he founded. Kim was instrumental in developing Korean ministry strategies in the conference and helped develop some 15 Korean American U.M. churches in New Jersey. During the next several years, as Korean immigration to the U.S. began to swell, Kim worked for the Annual Conference and for U.M. agencies as a bridge person, helping to bring understanding about the Korean community. He has been an advocate for ethnic minority causes, having strong links to the Korean community and to the Methodist Church of Korea. Kim went on to serve as the Chairperson of the Conference Council on Ministries and has provided leadership at the annual and general church levels. Prior to his election to the Episcopacy, he was a delegate to General Conferences (1980‚Äì92), as well as a Director of the U.M. General Board of Global Ministries (1980‚Äì99). During these years he had an important role in developing national and jurisdictional mission structures to facilitate Korean American ministries and congregations.

Following this, he was appointed Pastor of a church in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, from which he was elected a Bishop in July 1992. He served the New York West Episcopal Area from 1992 to 2000, and in 2000 became bishop of the Pittsburgh Area. He retired in 2004. In January 2005, a disciplinary complaint was brought against Bishop Kim. The details of the charges were handled in accordance with confidentiality requirements of the United Methodist Book of Discipline and were not disclosed. However, on August 30, 2005, Bishop Peter D. Weaver, then president of the United Methodist Council of Bishops, announced the resignation of Bishop Kim as a part of the resolution process. The resignation was to be effective September 1, 2005. Though he resigned from the United Methodist episcopacy, he retained his clergy credentials. In July 2008 he became the pastor of a very small United Methodist church. Bishop Kim likes to write poems. He has translated many Korean hymns into English, two of which are in the United Methdodist Hymnal: Lonely the Boat and \\"Mountains are All Aglow.

The department is located in the Raised Faculty Building on the Sidgwick Site and is part of the Cambridge School of Arts and Humanities. The Faculty achieved the best possible results from The Times 2004 and the QAA Subject Review 2001 (24/24). In the UK as of 2020, it is ranked second by the Guardian, second by the Philosophical Gourmet Report, and fifth by the QS World University Rankings. History of Philosophy at Cambridge In 1848 under the direction of William Whewell, two new honour examinations, one in natural sciences (relating to physical science), the other in moral sciences (in the sense of mores or social sciences) were introduced. Moral Sciences was interdisciplinary and included five subjects: moral philosophy, political economy, modern history, general jurisprudence and the laws of England. Moral Sciences was not popular as it did not lead to a degree, and in 1860 no candidates took the examinations. In 1861 following recommendations made by John Grote and Joseph Mayor, the Senate upgraded the status of Moral Sciences to become a three-year Undergraduate honours course in its own right. The Board of Moral Sciences Studies (a precursor to the Faculty) was also set up. Law became a separate subject and was replaced on the Moral Sciences Tripos by Mental philosophy (psychology). In 1867 the Board of Moral Sciences Studies recommended that History should also be omitted from the tripos. This was passed by the Council of the Senate, leaving four subjects: moral philosophy, logic, economics and psychology. At this time, J.N. Keynes and James Ward graduated with honours in Moral Sciences and its reputation grew. The increase in quality and to a lesser extent, in quantity, was assisted by the expansion of the teaching staff assisting the two Moral Sciences professors (Political Economy and Moral Philosophy). From the late 1860s a number of College lecturers in the Moral Sciences were appointed from St. John's, Trinity, Caius, and St. Catharine's who included Henry Sidgwick, Joseph Mayor, John Venn, Thomas Woodhouse Levin, and Alfred Marshall. Due to the efforts of Alfred Marshall, Economics was also dropped from the Moral Sciences Tripos, becoming a separate subject in 1903. This left a syllabus of analytic philosophy. Although Psychology remained nominally part of the Moral Sciences Tripos until after the Second World War, in practice it was an increasingly separate subject in the early part of the twentieth century. In the first half of the twentieth century Bertrand Russell, G.E. Moore, and Ludwig Wittgenstein were all at work in Cambridge. They were largely responsible for the rise of modern logic and the methods and results of analytic philosophy. Moral sciences was renamed philosophy in 1970. Constance Maynard was the first woman to read Moral Sciences at Cambridge, completing her studies in 1875.

It was the county seat of Logan County from 1848 until 1855. It is one of only two remaining courthouses from Illinois's Eighth Circuit, the circuit on which central Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln carried out much of his practice of law. The courthouse is operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency as a state historic site. Visitors are given guided tours of the recreated county offices and courtroom. 1848-1855: courthouse Prior to 1848, the people of Logan County used a frame courthouse, now the Postville Courthouse State Historic Site, located close to the center of the county at Postville. Frame courthouses were especially vulnerable to fire, and county leaders began looking for a community that would subsidize the construction of a masonry structure. Mount Pulaski citizens combined to contribute $2,700 toward the $3,000 for a new structure. This two-story brick building stands today as the Mount Pulaski Courthouse. The Greek Revival building features pediments spanning the length of the building and pilasters at each corner. When the new courthouse was built in 1848, Abraham Lincoln of nearby Springfield was representing central Illinois in the U.S. House of Representatives. Returning to Illinois in 1849, he resumed the practice of law in the Eighth Circuit, and often visited the Mount Pulaski courthouse. Mount Pulaski is located 25 miles (40 km) north of Springfield, a day's journey by the horse and light buggy that Lincoln used. Mount Pulaski is located in the southeastern quarter of Logan County. In the early 1850s, developers built a railroad, which would become the Chicago and Alton Railroad, northeastward from Springfield through Logan County. The new railroad became the focus of county development, and it did not go near Mount Pulaski. The railroad and county leaders agreed to move the Logan County seat once again, to a location very near the center of the county and directly on the new railroad line. The new county seat was named Lincoln, Illinois, after lawyer Lincoln, who by this time had made many friends throughout the county. The decision was affirmed by county voters in a referendum in 1853, and the court and county government had moved away by 1855. County leaders' fear of fire proved to be well-founded in 1857, when a blaze destroyed the relocated county records, including the dockets of the Logan County circuit court. As a result, very little is known of Lincoln's specific legal cases in Logan County during the Mount Pulaski interval. After 1855 Mount Pulaski only served as the county seat until 1853, when it moved to Lincoln, so the courthouse only served in its intended capacity for five years. After 1853, the building served as a school, the Mount Pulaski city hall and jail, and the local post office. Illinois Governor Henry Horner launched a statewide search in the 1930s for surviving public buildings with which Lincoln had been familiar. Mount Pulaski gave the old brick courthouse building to the state of Illinois in 1936, and the state extensively restored it in 1936-1939 to resemble its function as the county courthouse. The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 3, 1978, qualifying both because of its place in local history and because of its historically significant architecture. According to a member of the Logan County planning commission at the time, the building \\"ranks among the finest and best-preserved pre-1850 buildings in the state.\\" References External links *Mount Pulaski Courthouse State Historic Site Category:Government buildings completed in 1848 Category:Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area Category:Former courthouses in Illinois Category:Former post office buildings Category:Former school buildings in the United States Category:Greek Revival architecture in Illinois Category:Illinois State Historic Sites Category:Museums in Logan County, Illinois Category:Law museums in Illinois Category:Defunct schools in Illinois Category:County courthouses in Illinois Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Logan County, Illinois ","title":"Mount Pulaski Courthouse State Historic Site"},{"id":"4526361","title":"WFAE"},{"id":"4526363","text":"The Final Solution was the Nazi plan to kill all the Jews in Europe which culminated in the Holocaust.

He later attended the Faulkner University in Montgomery, Alabama and University of Texas at Austin, where he was a two-time Southwest Conference first team selection. Even though, his high school coach often made the comment that Reynolds was a far better player at basketball than baseball. Major League career The Astros selected Reynolds in the 3rd round of the 1989 MLB Draft. Reynolds made his debut on July 20, 1992 as the starting pitcher against the Pittsburgh Pirates in Houston. He went 3 2/3 innings while allowing six runs on eight hits as the Astros lost 11-8. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU199207200.shtml He appeared in seven further games in the next two months (starting four of them), going 1-3 in those games. It was his last game where he pitched his longest outing with five innings pitched, although he ended up with a 4-2 win. Overall, he struck out 10 batters while walking six on a 7.11 ERA. The following year, he would appear in just five total games, pitching twice in July and three times in the final eight games of the year (mostly as the middle reliever, although he did start Game 162). In total he pitched just eleven innings and struck out ten batters with six walks. 1994 was his first full year with the team. He went 8-5 with a 3.05 ERA while appearing in 33 games (14 starts). He pitched 124 innings while having 110 strikeouts and 21 walks. He received votes for Rookie of the Year, finishing 11th. The next year, he followed it up with more games as a starter, going 10-11 with a 3.47 ERA while pitching in 30 games for 189.1 innings. He struck out 175 batters while walking 37. Reynolds made his first start on Opening Day in 1996, doing so against the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Astrodome. He went five innings while allowing four runs on seven hits with five strikeouts and three walks in a 4-3 losing effort. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU199604010.shtml That year, he went 16-10 with a 3.65 ERA in 35 games while pitching a career high 239 innings and striking out 204 and walking 44 while finishing 9th in Cy Young Award voting. He started the 1997 season as the starter against the Atlanta Braves in the Astrodome. He went eight innings while allowing one run on seven hits in a 2-1 victory.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU199704010.shtml He went 9-10 with a 4.23 ERA in 30 games while pitching 181 innings and having 152 strikeouts and 47 walks. With the Astros that year, they made the playoffs as the NL Central champions and faced off against the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS. Trying to avoid elimination, Reynolds pitched in Game 3 against John Smoltz in Houston. The Braves took the lead in the first inning on a two-out home run by Chipper Jones while a Jeff Blauser RBI single ultimately proved the winning run as Reynolds pitched six innings and allowed two runs on five hits as the Braves won 4-1. His most productive season came in 1998, when he posted career numbers with a 19-8 record and a 3.51 earned run average in 233‚Öì innings of work. The Astros once again prevailed in the NL Central that year, and they faced off against the San Diego Padres in the NLDS. In Game 2, he went seven innings while allowing two runs on four hits although he would receive a no-decision in the 5-4 walkoff win (the only one in the series for the Astros). He followed with a 16-14 mark and a 3.85 ERA in 1999, while leading the league with 35 starts for the 2nd straight year. For the third straight year the Astros made it to the playoffs, and he would be the starting pitcher in Game 1. Facing the Braves and their ace Greg Maddux, Reynolds pitched six innings and allowed one run on seven hits as he prevailed over the Braves 6-1 for his only postseason win. In Game 4, he would last just five innings while allowing nine hits and four runs in 7-5 loss. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/ATL/ATL199910050.shtmlhttps://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU199910090.shtml In addition, he collected 15 or more wins and logged 200 or more innings in 1996 and from 1998‚Äì1999. As a result, Reynolds reached his 100th win and hurled more than 200 innings quicker than did Nolan Ryan in an Astros uniform.Baseball Reference Bullpen He finished in the top six of strikeouts for a National League pitcher in 1995, 1996, 1998, and 1999 while leading in games started in 1998 and 1999 (35 each). Reynolds made the Opening Day start in 2000, which made him the third Astro to have made five Opening Day starts (J.R. Richard and Mike Scott). Facing against Pittsburgh at the last Opening Day game held at Three Rivers Stadium, he went seven innings and allowed two runs on six hits while striking out four in a win as the Astros prevailed 5-2. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT200004040.shtml He got onto a 5-0 start (with four no-decisions) before losing his first game on May 27. Leading into the MLB All-Star Game, he was on a downturn, as he was 6-5 in 18 games before his All- Star selection (his first and only in his career). He pitched just four games after that for the season. In 2001, he bounced back in some ways, going 14-11 with a 4.34 ERA in 28 games while pitching 182.2 innings and striking out 102 and walking 36. In the 2001 NLDS that year, he faced the Braves once again. With the league-best Astros on the ropes in Game 3, he was tasked against John Burkett to have them live another day. However, he went just four innings while allowing four runs as the Braves swept the series with a 6-2 win. He regressed in his last year with the Astros for 2002, appearing in just 13 games while going 3-6 with a 4.86 ERA in 74 innings while striking out 47 and walking 26. He was granted free agency after the season but signed back with the team with the intent of playing the 2003 season. However, he was released on March 27; he was signed by the Braves on April 10. He went 11-9 with a 5.43 ERA in 30 games (29 starts) and 167.1 innings pitched. He had 94 strikeouts and 59 walks (a career high). On October 28, he was released by the Braves.

The over long trail follows the course of the Niagara Escarpment, often along its edge. Many parts of the trail go unused, although the Limehouse entrance sees a lot of tourism. History The Bruce trail contains the very reason Limehouse is a place on the map today: the kilns. Best accessed through the Limehouse Conservation Area the lime kilns can be found throughout the Limehouse section of the Bruce Trail. The kilns are slowly deteriorating because of age. However, the largest of them, a draw kiln, is currently being restored. A train station used to exist near the entrance of the Bruce Trail, and the earthen siding can be seen on the south side of the tracks, just east of the one lane car bridge that spans the rail road tracks. The rail bed for the former Toronto Suburban Railway can be seen about a kilometre west of the bridge on 22nd Side Road where it used to cross the road. The rail bed runs behind the gun club and east where it crossed 5th Line and the wood pilings can be seen in what used to be the head pond in what is now the Credit Valley Conservation Limehouse Park. The head pond is just some north of the Hole in the Wall feature of the Bruce Trail. On satellite maps of the area, you can if you look closely, trace the track-bed of the radial railway all the way back to Georgetown. There are also caves and seemingly never-ending crevices along the Bruce Trail. There are bridges and ladders leading throughout some parts of the trail, and there are designated biking sections of it as well. The area is not policed, so these areas should be explored at one's own risk. Economy Agriculture There are many farms and fields located in Limehouse. On 5th and 4th Line, the outskirts of Limehouse, you can drive and seemingly think you were hundreds of miles away from any cities. Particularly, on 4th Line there is the Mountainview Farm which is run by a single family. They race a few of their 35 horses at Woodbine Racetrack and have wild boar at their farm. This is only one example of the many other similar families. There are also riding lessons provided on 17th Sideroad, provided by a family farm. Activities There is a community centre located in the heart of Limehouse, just around the corner from Limehouse School and the Junkyard, the latter being in the process of clearing and rehabilitating. Events are held at the time of holidays throughout the year, as well as for various community functions. Quarries There are quarries throughout Limehouse in which people have mined limestone for more than a century. Currently, Duff Quarry is up and running and sponsoring many events for Limehouse Public School. Once inside the quarries, you can see machinery spread out over great distances, and stone piles that are many metres high.

Komiks were partially inspired by American mainstream comic strips and comic books during the early 20th century. Particularly after World War II, the medium became widely popular, though its mainstream appeal has subsided somewhat with the advent of other mass-media forms such as telenovelas. Webcomics produced by independent Filipino web- based artists have caught the attention of local and foreign readers. The word komiks is simply the English word \\"comics,\\" adapted to fit the orthography of native Filipino languages such as Tagalog.  History   Origins  While the first indigenous cartoons may be traced to Jos√© Rizal's illustration of the fable \\"The Tortoise and the Monkey\\" (1885), the origins of the mainstream komiks industry would not arise until after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In the 1920s, Liwayway magazine began running comic strips under the direction of Romualdo Ramos and Tony Velasquez, such as the still-running Mga Kabalbalan ni Kenkoy (The Misadventures of Kenkoy). Valasquez is considered the father of Filipino comics.\\"Filipino Artist Tony Velasquez ‚Äì Founding Father of Philippine Komiks (Comics),\\" AllPhilippines.com.  Evolution  Originally inspired by American comic strips and comic books left behind by American GIs, the medium steadily diverged, and by the 1950s, drew more inspiration from other forms of Filipino literature such as komedya, as well as Philippine mythology. Many komiks were evidently inspired by specific American comics, such as Kulafu and Og (Tarzan), Darna (Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman), and D. I. Trece (Dick Tracy). The predominance of superheroes has continued into the modern day. However, other characters such as Dyesebel draw more from traditional folklore.  Breaking into the American comics scene  In the late 1960s, Filipino artist Tony DeZuniga broke into the American comics industry. In 1971, DC Comics editor Joe Orlando and publisher Carmine Infantino traveled to the Philippines on a recruiting trip.Duncan, Randy and Smith, Matthew J. \\"Filipino Artists,\\" The Power of Comics: History, Form & Culture (Continuum, 2009). Alfredo Alcala, Mar Amongo, Ernie Chan, Alex Ni√±o, Nestor Redondo, and Gerry Talaoc were some of the Filipino komik artists who went on to work for DC, particularly in the 1970s and '80s. A similar trip by Pendulum Press editor Vincent Fago led to a great number of Filipino artists working on the Pendulum Now Age Classics series, black-and-white comic book adaptations of literary classics which were published from 1973‚Äì1980. Visiting the Philippines in 1970, Fago teamed with Nestor Redondo to recruit Flipino artists for Pendulum.Fago, Vincent, \\"Nestor Redondo and the Pendulum Classics,\\" in Arthur Conan Doyle: Rosebud Graphic Classics (Eureka Productions, 2002), pp. 4-6. In addition to the work of Redondo, who illustrated more than 20 books in the series, the Pendulum Illustrated Classics featured the artwork of Alex Ni√±o,Arndt, Richard J. \\"A 2005 Interview with Steve Bissette about Bizarre Adventures!\\" Enjolrasworld.com: Marvel‚Äôs Black & White Horror Magazines Checklist. Accessed May 8, 2013. Gerry Talaoc,Gerry Talaoc at Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Vicatan, Rudy Nebres, Jun Lofamia, Nestor Leonidez, and E. R. Cruz. (Redondo's brothers Virgilio and Frank also illustrated books in the series.) Beginning in 1978 and lasting until about 1983, the black-and-white comics magazine publisher Warren Publishing also utilized the talents of a number of Filipino artists, including Ni√±o, Nebres, and Alcala. At Marvel Steve Gan became highly regarded for his artwork on both Conan titles Conan the Barbarian and Savage Sword of Conan from 1974 - 1979. From the mid-1980s on, fewer Filipino artist found work in the American comics industry, the exceptions being DeZuniga, Chan, Alcala, and Talaoc.  Popularity  At one point, between 33 and 40 percent of Filipinos read komiks, but this number has since dwindled somewhat due to competition from other media forms.Macaraig, Mynardo. ‚ÄòKOMIKS‚Äô INDUSTRY FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL, Planet Philippines (October 17, 2010). More recently, comic artists have begun producing what is often called \\"Pinoy Manga,\\"\\"Top 100 Pinoy Komiks,\\" Filipiniana.net. inspired largely by Japanese anime and manga, which have been widely available in the Philippines since the 1970s.

Hedley-Lewis was President of the local Ramblers' Associations, and a memorial stile was made for him on the route at Stenwith, a half-mile north of the Rutland ArmsRutland Arms in Woolsthorpe-by-Belvoir. The Countryside Commission recognised the significance of the Viking Way as a high quality long distance walk linking other major routes in Eastern England, these being the Yorkshire Wolds Way at the northern end, the Hereward Way and Macmillan Way from Oakham and indirectly via the Hereward Way, the Jurassic Way from Stamford and the southern end of the Peddars Way from Thetford. Most of the route is designated as part of the European long distance path E2. Many prehistoric settlements were established on dry ground in the Lincolnshire Wolds and on the Limestone Heath. The route passes sites of early settlements. There is evidence that the Vikings exercised influence over the county (Danelaw) in the 9th century: e.g. the place names ending in by, Scandinavian names recorded in documents and also names marked on coins. Much of the Viking Way is classified as a Byway Open to All Traffic (BOAT) and is thus a vehicular right of way. Route North Lincolnshire The walk passes under the Humber Bridge, then follows the escarpment of the Ancholme Valley over the M180 at the A15 roundabout (Barnetby Top). This section was part of Humberside until April 1996. Lincolnshire View towards Market Rasen from south of Tealby It follows the Lincolnshire Wolds over the AONB through Caistor, crossing the A46, and Horncastle, crossing the A158. It follows the River Bain into Woodhall Spa along a former railway, now the Spa Trail. It heads north-west through Stixwould, Southrey, Bardney, Stainfield, before reaching Fiskerton where it follows the south side of the River Witham towards Lincoln due west. It used to run alongside the river on Waterside South and then down Canwick Road, but was diverted in around 2002 to take a detour near Washingborough over the river. From here it crosses the Lincoln ‚Äì Grimsby railway, then enters Lincoln on Crofton Road then skirts the south side of Lincoln County Hospital, follows Lindum Terrace and crosses the A15. It passes Pottergate and enters the grounds of Lincoln Cathedral, passing the south side on Minster Yard. It heads down Steep Hill and follows the main shopping High Street of Lincoln, over the River Witham and crosses the railway at a level crossing. It follows Tentercroft Street then continues along Sincil Bank towards the football ground. It heads along Scorer Street towards South Park, and meets the old route on Canwick Road (B1188). It then runs along the southern edge of the South Common, which also forms the boundary between the borough of Lincoln and North Kesteven and crosses the A15 on the North Kesteven boundary. Sewstern Lane west of Allington It runs parallel to the A607 to the west of Bracebridge Heath and through Waddington, Harmston, Coleby, Boothby Graffoe, Navenby and Wellingore along the Lincoln Cliff, then follows the old Ermine Street, crossing the A607. Near High Dyke Farm, just north of the A17 it meets the boundary of South Kesteven and North Kesteven, west of RAF Cranwell. At Byard's Leap it crosses the A17 and follows the B6403 towards Ancaster along the South Kesteven boundary (which continues to just north of Ancaster). It heads west and enters South Kesteven. It meets the A607 again at Carlton Scroop, then crosses the River Witham and passes through Marston and Long Bennington. It was extended to Long Bennington in 1997 to allow walkers to cross the A1 on a road bridge, as previously they were obliged to cross the road directly, near Foston. It no longer goes through Allington, and crosses the A52 near Sedgebrook and a level crossing over the Nottingham to Grantham Line. It then follows what used to be called Sewstern Lane and meets the Lincolnshire ‚Äì Leicestershire boundary near Harston which it follows and crosses the A607. It passes Saltby Airfield (former RAF Saltby) and Buckminster, then goes through Sewstern where it briefly enters Leicestershire and the borough of Melton. Rutland It rejoins the Lincolnshire boundary near to the source of the River Witham then enters Rutland and Thistleton. It passes alarmingly close to the former RAF Cottesmore and goes through Greetham and Exton. It meets the A606 and Hereward Way at Whitwell, then passes through the two watersports centres on Rutland Water at Whitwell and Barnsdale. From here it follows the A606 from Barnsdale Hill into Oakham. When the route was opened, it followed main roads from Exton to Oakham; the facilities at Whitwell and Barnsdale had not then been developed.

It is administered by Merrill Lynch. The Master II is a measure of the broad high yield market, unlike the Merrill Lynch BB/B Index, which excludes lower-rated securities. History The High Yield Master II Index came into being in 1989. Martin Fridson, who then headed Merrill Lynch's high yield bond research department, brought a problem to the attention of Phil Galdi, who was responsible for bond indexes. The existing High Yield Master Index excluded two types of issues that were becoming popular because of the boom in leveraged buyout financing, zero- coupon bonds and payment-in-kind (PIK) bonds. Galdi's solution was to maintain the existing rules for the Master Index, but to create a new index that included \\"zeros\\" and PIKs. The new Master II was introduced with retroactive data that extended its history back to August 31, 1986. The BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. Qualifying securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody‚Äôs, S&P; and Fitch), at least 18 months to final maturity at the time of issuance, at least one year remaining term to final maturity as of the rebalancing date, a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. In addition, qualifying securities must have risk exposure to countries that are members of the FX-G10, Western Europe or territories of the US and Western Europe. The FX-G10 includes all Euro members, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. Original issue zero coupon bonds, 144a securities (both with and without registration rights), and pay-in-kind securities (including toggle notes) are included in the index. Callable perpetual securities are included provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities are included provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Contingent capital securities (‚Äúcocos‚Äù) are excluded, but capital securities where conversion can be mandated by a regulatory authority, but which have no specified trigger, are included. Other hybrid capital securities, such as those legacy issues that potentially convert into preference shares, those with both cumulative and non-cumulative coupon deferral provisions, and those with alternative coupon satisfaction mechanisms, are also included in the index. Securities issued or marketed primarily to retail investors, equity-linked securities, securities in legal default, hybrid securitized corporates, eurodollar bonds (USD securities not issued in the US domestic market), taxable and tax-exempt US municipal securities and DRD-eligible securities are excluded from the index. Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding times the market price plus accrued interest. Accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the index. Information concerning constituent bond prices, timing and conventions is provided in the BofA Merrill Lynch Bond Index Guide, which can be accessed on Bloomberg (IND2[go], 4[go]). The index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. No changes are made to constituent holdings other than on month end rebalancing dates.

Oaklawn Plantation was a large plantation of 5326 acres (21¬Ω km2) in northern Leon County in the U.S. state of Florida. It was established around 1850 by Captain William Lester (born December 24, 1790) of Burke County, Georgia. Location Oaklawn Plantation was located on two tracts of land. The first and northernmost tract would become what is now parts of Killearn Lakes Plantation and the private hunting preserve of Horseshoe Plantation and extending south to Bradfordville. The second and southernmost tract would become properties on Ox Bottom Rd and edge Thomasville Road.

The house was an antebellum I-house with Carolina type porch and enclosed rear shed rooms. The owner In 1834, prior to coming to Florida, Lester became the head of vigilante committee called \\"The Regulators\\" during the funeral of a Mr. Roundtree. In May 1846, the Florida Superior Court the grand jury investigated the deaths of two Georgia citizens at the hands of The Regulators. Judge Scarborough instructed the grand jury not to indict The Regulators for murder, but to issue a warning that they would be indicted the next time. The grand jury called on the officers of The Regulators to dismiss the body that was no longer needed for the purpose it was organized. William Lester was a signee to the Southern Rights Association of Centreville District on secession from the Union for the protection of Southern interests and the vindication of Southern rights to preserve and protect the Constitution in its purity as the basis of Federal compact, and the only foundation on which the Union of the States was made, or on which that Union should be preserved.FCLA By 1870, he owned 5,000 acres (20 km2) of land in Texas, Georgia, and Florida.Paisley, Clifton; From Cotton To Quail, University of Florida Press, c1968. Lester Cemetery had an ornamental iron fence. An obelisk marked the location of Captain Lester and his wife Rhoda. A total of 11 interments with brick vaults were at this cemetery before its removal. Pieces of pearlware sherd were found around the graveyard.

The lake bed is a thick layer of silt, which has been used since 1886 in institutions for mud cures in Yessentuki and other therapeutic mud baths in the region of Caucasian Mineral Water. These mud baths have been used by famous individuals such as Feodor Chaliapin, Anton Chekhov, and Leo Tolstoy. Notable events In 1395, the warlord Timur took a bath in Tambukan Lake. In 1709, Kabardian prince Murzarbek Tambiev defeated the Crimean-Turkish army near this lake . The word Tambukan comes from Turkic words Tambu qanƒ± and means Tambiev‚Äôs blood or Tambiev‚Äôs asylum.

While crossing the Atlantic, the convoy was intercepted by one of the first Kriegsmarine submarine wolfpacks. During the ensuing battle, the escort was completely overwhelmed and 20 of the 35 cargo vessels were sunk and 2 more damaged, with 141 lives lost. The disastrous outcome of the convoy demonstrated the German submarines' potential of being able to work more efficiently using wolfpack tactics and the inadequacy of British anti-submarine tactics at the time. Ships of the convoy The slow convoy SC 7 left Sydney, Nova Scotia on 5 October 1940 bound for Liverpool and other British ports. The convoy was supposed to make but several merchant ships were much slower, necessitating a further reduced speed.. The convoy consisted of older, smaller ships, mostly with essential cargoes of bulk goods. Much of the freight on these ships originated on Canada's east coast, especially from points to the north and east of Sydney. Typical cargoes included pit props from eastern New Brunswick for British coal mines, lumber, pulpwood, grain from the Great Lakes ports, steel and steel ingots from the Sydney plant and iron ore from Newfoundland, bound for the huge steel plants of Wales. The largest ship in the convoy was the 9,512-ton oil tanker , belonging to the Admiralty, which was bound for the Clyde with fuel for the Royal Navy. Another ship, the British , carried a valuable cargo of trucks. Many of the ships were British but the convoy included Greek, Swedish, Norwegian and Dutch vessels. The convoy commodore, Vice Admiral Lachlan Donald Ian Mackinnon, a retired naval officer who volunteered for this civilian duty, sailed in , a British ship of . As convoy commodore, Mackinnon was in charge of the good order of the merchant ships but did not command the escort. The sloop was sole naval escort for the first three quarters of the journey. There was no aircraft protection in 1940 for Allied ships in the Atlantic Ocean after leaving coastal regions. Scarborough would have had little chance against a surface attack by a German raider. Many of the merchant ship captains were resentful at having to sail in convoy and would have preferred to take their chances on their own, rather than risk such a slow crossing with a weak escort. They were often uncooperative; at one point early in the voyage Scarboroughs captain was shocked to find a Greek merchant ship in the convoy travelling at night with her lights on. Battle 5‚Äì18 October The convoy sailed on Saturday 5 October 1940. On the first day, one ship, dropped out with mechanical trouble, and had to return to port. The convoy \\"ran into a gale\\" on 8 October and then were engaged by U-boats.Keegan (2002), p. 230 As bad weather set in on 11 October, several ships became separated and were forced to sail independently. One of these, , was a small Canadian Laker of 1,813 tons, with a cargo of lumber destined for Scotland. She was sighted by on 16 October and sunk. The Greek freighter was seen by and sunk on the 17 October but , another Laker, avoided this fate and was able to rescue survivors from Aenos, before arriving safely at Rothesay on 19 October. A fourth straggler regained the convoy on 15 October. On 17 October, as the convoy entered the Western Approaches, Scarborough was joined by the sloop and the new corvette . Later that day they were sighted by , which attacked, sinking two ships including the tanker Languedoc. Scarborough counter-attacked, driving U-48 deep so she was unable to shadow or report but the attack was prolonged unwisely and the convoy moved so far ahead that Scarborough was unable to rejoin. On 18 October SC 7 was joined by the sloop and the corvette , with Leith assuming command. Later that day, U-38 sighted the convoy and attacked, damaging . Leith and Heartsease attacked without success, though U-38 was driven off and Heartsease was detailed to escort Carsbreck home, weakening the escort further. 18/19 October On the night of 18/19 October, , , , and made a concerted attack. U-99 was captained by the famous ace Korvettenkapit√§n Otto Kretschmer. The attack was coordinated from Lorient by Admiral Karl D√∂nitz and his staff. An early casualty was the iron ore ship, , bound for Cardiff, Wales. With her heavy cargo, she sank quickly, taking all 36 crew members with her. Later that night, SC 7 lost many of its members, including Empire Brigade with her cargo of trucks and six of her crew and with her cargo of steel ingots from Sydney. She sank quickly as well, taking with her 38 of her 39-man crew. Also among the casualties was the commodore's ship, Assyrian, which went down with 17 crew (Mackinnon was rescued after a long immersion in the chilly waters). In all, 16 ships were lost in this six-hour period. 18‚Äì20 October On 18 October, was torpedoed by U-101 and was abandoned. She was torpedoed again on 19 October by U-100 but remained afloat. She was towed to the Clyde and later repaired at Greenock. The escorts were unable to prevent any of these losses; their responses were uncoordinated and ineffective. They never realised that the attacking submarines did not attack submerged or from outside the convoy, but were actually running surfaced between the ships inside the convoy. Therefore, the escorts were unable to mount any serious attacks on the U-boats, and had to spend much of their time rescuing survivors. During 19 October, the escorts, loaded with survivors, gathered together those ships that remained. Fowey collected eight ships and made for the Clyde, arriving there a few days later. Scarborough passed through the scene of the battle later on 19 October; she found wreckage, but no survivors. Later that afternoon Leith met Heartsease, still escorting the damaged Carsbreck; together they headed for Gourock, Renfrewshire, collecting two more stragglers on the way. Bluebell with over 200 survivors on board, headed directly for the Clyde, arriving on 20 October. Aftermath SC 7 had lost 20 ships out of 35, of which seven fell to Kretschmer's U-99. The total tonnage lost was . The arrival of convoy HX 79 in the vicinity had diverted the U-boats and they went on to sink 12 ships from HX 79 that night. No U-boats were lost in either engagement. The loss of 28 ships in 48 hours made 18 and 19 October the worst two days for shipping losses in the entire Atlantic campaign. The attack on SC 7 was a vindication of the U-boat Arm's wolfpack tactic, and was the most successful U-boat attack of the Atlantic campaign. The convoy escort was ineffective in guarding against the attack. Convoy tactics were rudimentary at this early stage of the war. The escorts' responses were uncoordinated, as the ships were unused to working together with a common battle-plan. Command fell to the senior officer present, and could change as each new ship arrived.Lund, Ludlum p The escorts were torn between staying with the convoy, abandoning survivors in the water, as DEMS regulations demanded, and picking them up, leaving the convoy unprotected and risking being torpedoed themselves.

San Justo is a relatively prosperous city enjoying a variety of commercial and cultural resources. Its strategic location on National Highway 3 and Provincial Highway 4 (the Greater Buenos Aires beltway), make it among the most active, for its size, in the partido. Pedro Bonifacio Palacios, an Argentine poet, was born in San Justo, and one of the main streets of the city is named in his honor under his nickname Almafuerte. The Plaza San Mart√≠n is the center of La Matanza and its civic center, where the main institutions of the partido are located within a four-block radius. History Magistrate Lino Lagos made the first applications in 1852 for the land needed to establish a capital city in La Matanza. It was not however until 1856 that the land was granted. Jos√© Gorchs, representing the heirs of Justo Villegas, proposed that the foundation took place in the lands they possessed and was willing to donate them to the community. There they would build a municipality, a church, school and security management. The handed lots also included lands for the construction of a cemetery, a market and a residential area. On December 25, 1856, the city was founded on land requisitioned from Justo Villegas, a prominent landowner; at the request of the heirs of Justo Villegas, the city was named San Justo. Melchor Romero was in charge of the demarcation of the village, it was adopted on November 13, 1857, by the Survey Department of the Province, thus being limited to a square league. The civic center was built in the Spanish Colonial form, with a park and the town hall, the church, the bank and the police station on each one of its sides. The economy was based mainly on livestock and agricultural activity, the grain production being the most predominant. After 1852 there were some changes regarding the livestock activity such as cattle breeding being displaced by wool-bearing (preponderant until the late nineteenth century). Society and Economy Avenida Arieta San Justo became an important industrial center during the 1940s and 1950s. The city, however, suffered the loss of a sizeable portion of its industrial base after 1980. Shantytowns (referred to as villas miserias in Argentina) blight numerous abandoned lots in the city, particularly in the western half, though public housing efforts have been recently stepped up, a process of revitalization aided by the return of numerous industrial and wholesaling employers. Some of the largest employers in San Justo include an Acindar steel mill, construction materials maker Eternit, the Papelera Tucum√°n paper mill, and a former Siam di Tella machinery factory purchased in 1986 by the P√©rez Companc Group. The city continued to grow and, as fewer than 20% live in substandard housing, most of its 36,000 households live in middle-class neighborhoods. Education The San Justo Women's Chorus San Justo residents avail themselves of numerous primary, secondary and tertiary schools, the best-known of which are probably the \\"Almafuerte\\" School, an award-winning public school, and the San Justo Parochial School. The National University of La Matanza is located in San Justo, and is now a leading center for education, sports and cultural activities in the area.

Sayers, featuring Lord Peter Wimsey and published as the first story in Hangman's Holiday in 1933. Plot summary This story is notable for its inaccurate depiction of right/left mirror image twins, and more generally for its use of popular science to explore the subject of inversion. A man, who states that his body is a mirror image of the normal body plan, confesses to Lord Peter Wimsey that he is worried he is going mad, due to blackouts in which he (or somebody identical to him) has committed crimes. Wimsey states that as soon as he heard that the man was a mirror image he knew there must be an identical twin who was the other, 'right' half, briefly mentioning experiments with salamander eggs to back up this claim. This reference is to genuine experiments, pioneering knowledge about the chemical gradient that exists in all mammalian embryos, defining the development of front versus back, top versus bottom and left versus right. Though it is possible to have mirror image twins, in fact this is a very rare occurrence, and not a near certainty as described in the story. Having deduced the existence of the evil twin it was an easy matter to find and arrest him, freeing the good twin from the shadow of his evil twin's misdeeds. The story's solution involves a revelation about an unmarried woman who secretly gave birth and let her child be raised by a relative ‚Äì which Sayers herself did in real life, though this was unknown to the public at the time when the story was published.

Many of these traditions hearken to the university's strength in engineering, such as the buggy races and the mobots, while others are purely social in nature, such as Spring Carnival and The Fence.Carnegie Mellon Traditions . Alma Mater The alma mater of Carnegie Mellon University was written by Charles J. Taylor and set to music by J. Vick O'Brien when the university was still known as Carnegie Institute of Technology. The song was copyrighted by the institute in 1924. While not as commonly used as at some other universities, the alma mater plays a critical role in the culture and history of Carnegie Mellon University. It is sung at convocation ceremonies of incoming classes, commencement ceremonies of graduating classes, and other official events such as the investiture of new presidents. The university's Kiltie Band plays it at certain home games as well. The full song is composed of three verses. However, usually, only one the first verse is usually performed. Verses First Verse The first verse references history of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the university is located. In the late-18th Century, after the United States won its independence, the settlement at the present day city of Pittsburgh was known as the frontier and the Gateway to the West. The verse describes the presence of the wildernesses through which the original westward-bound settlers had to get through in order to reach their goal. The verse ends with a prideful intonation that Carnegie Mellon was founded in this storied city by Andrew Carnegie.https://www.cmu.edu/about/history.html Note that this verse is usually the only one sung in modern day. It is rare for the other two to be performed. Second Verse The second verse begins with Pittsburgh's crucial role in the early days of the nation's founding as the frontier and Gateway to the West. It then goes on to reference the long history of the labor movement in the city's history through the Antebellum Era and Gilded Age. Upon its founding in 1900, Andrew Carnegie had intended the university to be a vocational school for the children of the workers of his steel mills. As time went on and the university progressed from its founding, it embraced the arts as exemplified by the fact that its Carnegie Mellon School of Drama is the oldest degree-granting program in the country while continuing to focus on its technical and scientific education.https://www.cmu.edu/about/history.html To this day, the university maintains a very strong collaborative culture between all of the constituent colleges ranging from the arts to the sciences as exemplified by the unique BXA program offered. Third Verse The last verse references the university's dedication to excellence and academic excellence while maintaining high quality teaching. It references the increasing reputation of the institute nationally and globally and intones that it should continue its pursuit of collecting and disseminating knowledge. The Fence The Fence, 2006 The first great tradition at Carnegie Mellon is The Fence, built in 1923, which lies in the middle of the Cut. The Fence frequently displays witty or poignant messages, but is just as often used to advertise upcoming events or recent accomplishments. Because of its highly visible location on campus, it is an ideal place to proclaim one's message to as much of the student body as possible. The original wooden fence was replaced in 1993 when it collapsed under its own weight due to six inches of surrounding paint. At the time, it held the Guinness World Record for being the most painted object. Today, a concrete and steel reinforced fence stands where the original one stood, imitating the size it would be today. Students still paint the fence in an effort to break the record held by the original as the world's most painted upon object. Currently the fence has four inches of paint. The Fence's origins date back to the early days of Carnegie Institute of Technology when The Cut was still a valley that separated the Carnegie Tech buildings from the Margaret Morrison women's school. Over the valley spanned a bridge which the men of Carnegie Tech realized was a strategic spot for meeting the women of Maggie Mo as they crossed the cut. However, when The Cut was filled in to form the current-day grassy field, the bottleneck disappeared. In its stead, the administration erected a fence to stand in as a meeting spot. However, the university's students took a negative view of the structure, not understanding the point of it. The administration was just about to give up and tear it down when the night before its scheduled removal a fraternity painted The Fence in the middle of the night, advertising a party on campus. The party turned out to be a huge success, as has the tradition of painting the fence. The administration relented on their plans for removing the fence. In August 2008, the graduating class of 2008 at the Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley Campus brought the tradition to California by installing their own version of the fence, and dedicating it to Randy Pausch, who died in that year. Tradition dictates that The Fence only be painted after midnight and before sunrise, and only in its entirety. It must be painted by hand using brushes. If it is painted with spray paint or rollers, the painters would be cited for vandalism. A group wishing to paint the Fence must station two representatives, or \\"guards\\", on the small gravel region surrounding it. As long as two guards remain within the boundary, no other group may \\"take\\" the Fence. This sometimes leads to groups setting up a tent or campsite just inside the boundary so that they may \\"hold\\" the fence for an extended amount of time. It is also unwritten etiquette that if another group needs the Fence to advertise one of their upcoming events, the current holders should turn the Fence over to that group. This often leads to extended periods of time when the Fence is passed between groups in an organized fashion. Two years of paint layers are visible after the defacing. On March 21, 2011, six freshman Carnegie Mellon students defaced the fence. They were stopped by fellow students, CMU Police Officers, and representatives from the Office of Student Affairs. A hacksaw was used to cut away over two years' worth of layers of paint.In Pittsburgh, outrage over CMU fence key rally point for campus life that was vandalized.Vandals take hacksaw to Fence, deface campus symbol The following night, hundreds of CMU students helped paint the fence in an effort to \\"heal\\" it.Fence restoration rallies students to take action Facilities Management Services has taken the responsibility of repairing the fence. Instead of gluing it back together, the chunks were removed on March 23, leaving dozens of different layers visible. The Fence is used not only to advertise upcoming events for a variety of organizations, but also to recognize different political views, religious or ethnic holidays, as well as support those on campus that may feel underrepresented. Spring Carnival Usually held in April, Spring Carnival is the biggest event of the Carnegie Mellon school year. Students have a four-day weekend to enjoy the Carnival festivities. Many students work hard all year to make it a success, and the Pittsburgh community is invited to attend. Alumni often return for the festivities, and Reunion coincides with the weekend. Spring Carnival features \\"Midway\\", with all the standard carnival attractions, and a Buggy race which is run over the course of the weekend. Many organizations across campus construct both a booth for Midway and a buggy for Sweepstakes. Judges decide on winners in several different categories. Two pushers exchange the buggy for Kappa Delta Rho on the first hill of Sweepstakes. Buggy races Buggy, officially called Sweepstakes, is a race around Schenley Park. It can be thought of as a relay race with five runners, using the buggy vehicle as the baton. Entrants submit a small, usually torpedo-shaped, vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to free-roll downhill. The driver (who‚Äìlike all participants‚Äìmust be a Carnegie Mellon student, and is almost always short, light, and female) lies down inside the vehicle with the steering and brake controls. The vehicles are completely unpowered, including the prohibition of energy storing devices such as flywheels. Brakes are required but generally rarely used. Often, brakes are applied only as a last resort to prevent a crash, or to slow the buggy at the finish for the pusher to catch up because the rules specify that the pusher must be in contact with buggy at the finish line or be disqualified. Drivers who have been forced to apply the brakes due to another driver cutting them off may appeal for a re-roll in another heat without penalty. The second-to-last corner of the race, a sharp 110-degree right turn, is affectionately called \\"The Chute\\" and is lined with hay bales to prevent potential driver and spectator injury. Speeds can be quite high in the chute, often in the vicinity of 35 mph. Student Dormitory Council (SDC)http://cmubuggy.org/history/org/sdc holds the current men's record of 2:02.16 and the current women's record of 2:23.27, both set in 2017.https://cmubuggy.org/history/record For many years extensive experimentation and innovation evolved buggy designs. Prior to 1980 the primary format used 4 wheels in a symmetrical layout with respect to the direction of travel. Exceptions to this did occur with both 3-wheeled buggies and 2-wheeled \\"bikes\\" being entered on occasion. Since 1980, new materials, braking systems and wheel orientations provided significant opportunity for experimentation. Alignment of wheels received particular attention. The first successful 3 wheeled buggies were developed in the early 80s led by Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) and Sigma Nu. Development of two wheeled buggies by Delta Upsilon from 1986‚Äì1989 continued the theme of wheel alignment. In 1988, Delta UpsilonDelta Upsilon broke the course record with a time of 2:08.52:08.5 a record that stood only briefly as SPIRIT surpassed that time later that day and further lowered the record time the following day. Two wheeled buggies were later eliminated from competition for safety reasons through modifications to the rules. PiKA and SPIRIT took every Sweepstakes championship from 1986 until 2000 when SDC won the women's race and 2001 when Fringe won the men's race. PiKA continued its success in the 2000s, setting the consecutive wins record by winning for seven years in a row (2002‚Äì2008). SDC took the title in the men's race in 2009 breaking PiKA's streak and setting a new record. Fringe took the men's title in 2010 after a dominant SDC was removed from competition due to an alleged fire safety violation. Fringe took the men's title again in 2011 in beating SDC A by 1 second, with SDC B and C teams taking 3rd and 4th, while SDC reclaimed the Women's title. The defending men's champion is SDC with eight consecutive wins from 2012 through 2019, which is the record for most wins in a row. The current women's title is also held by SDC (2017, 2018 and 2019). Live media coverage of the Sweepstakes races has historically been provided by WRCT-FM, the school's student-run radio station. In recent years, campus television station cmuTV has broadcast live video coverage of the races with commentary from WRCT-FM. In the fall of 2008 the Buggy Alumni AssociationBuggy Alumni Association was founded to preserve the history of the sport, assist with keeping alumni connected to the event and assist the current students in maintaining the race's continuing existence. The race videos are available on DVD from cmuTV after the races end. Midway A booth in Carnegie Mellon University's 2013 Booth Competition, a part of the spring Carnival For Carnival Weekend, the College of Fine Arts parking lot is turned into \\"Midway.\\" Midway features both booths and carnival rides. Booths are multi-story structures constructed by campus organizations, featuring (usually) free games and cheap giveaway prizes. The booths are intricate, multi-level affairs, showing off the creativity and energy of the students who construct them. The Friday of the week before Carnival is known as \\"Move On\\", and is when all the organizations who are building booths move their supplies, materials, tools, and pre-fabricated components onto Midway. Build week commences from that Friday night, and for the entire week, organizations steadfastly build their booths, preparing for the official opening of Midway at 3:00 pm the following Thursday. Each year, an overall theme for booths is chosen. Booth has four competitive categories. These include: fraternity, sorority, independent, and blitz (smaller booths). Each organization chooses a sub-theme and builds their booth accordingly. The construction of these booths is a competition and each booth is judged on various criteria, including both daytime and nighttime appearance, adherence to theme, game playability, environmentalism, and appropriateness of prizes. Midway also features portable carnival rides that are brought in and set up, along with standard carnival concession food. Various musical acts, improv comedy troupes, and other performances are staged in a nearby tent running throughout the weekend and providing a backdrop to the entire spectacle. Mobot A mobot approaches the end of the course, with Hamerschlag Hall in the background. \\"Mobot,\\" a general term resulting from shortening \\"mobile robot\\", is an annual competition at Carnegie Mellon that made its debut in 1994. In this event, robots try (autonomously) to pass through gates, in order, and reach the finish line. There is a white line on the pavement connecting the gates, and the line is normally used to find the gates, though it is not mandated by the rules that the robots follow the line. Towards the end of the course, the lines split and merge randomly, and knowledge of which line leads to the next gate is needed to consistently finish the course. This information is provided by the judges shortly before the actual competition begins. The current undergraduate mobot course record of 1:17:10 is held by Nathaniel Barshay for his entry \\"AEPi\\" which competed in 2010. The overall mobot course record of 33.99 seconds is held by a Michael Licitra and Jeff McMahill set in 2009. In Carnival fashion, awards are presented to overall winners. The rewards are as follows: First Place ($1000), Second Place ($500), Third Place ($250), Open Class ($250), Judges' Choice ($100), Course Record ($250), and MoboJoust ($100). Entry to compete in the Mobot competition is free and is for currently enrolled undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon. The Mobot Competition is run and organized by the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Kiltie Band The Kiltie Band is the concert and marching band of Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It is known for wearing kilts, in recognition of the Scottish- American ancestry of Andrew Carnegie, the founder of the university. As of 2017, the band's director is music professor Paul Gerlach. The band was formed in 1908 with seven members and has grown to more than 130 members. The band took the field for its first official performance on November 25, 1922 on what would have been Andrew Carnegie's 87th birthday. Until 1957, the band was male only, but in that year a female flutist joined and by 1961 there were eleven young women in the band. In the early nineties the band, under the direction of Paul Gerlach who was known as the Director For Life without the Possibility for Parole, started a new tradition within the band. Drawing inspiration from the critically acclaimed 1975 film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a trumpeter of the band (Ray Strobel), wrote an arrangement of King Arthur's Quest for the band. To this day, a King takes to the track every home game between the third and fourth quarters, to quest for the Grail, with his loyal steed, Patsy. The Kiltie Marching Band consists of musicians and colorguard and plays at all Carnegie Mellon home football games. There is a new show every week with music ranging from traditional marches and oldies to current pop tunes and jazz standards. After football season, the Kiltie Concert Band plays a holiday concert and two spring concerts, including a performance at Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs Spring Carnival. Additionally, a part of the band gets together and acts as a pep band for the basketball teams. Membership is open to all members of the campus/community without audition. Participants must do their best to promote the success of the ensemble through attendance, attitude, and dependability.

While in England he was banned by the authorities from preaching publicly and was employed as a chaplain by William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele. He married his wife Tamisen Brike in England and had five children: Samuel, Hannah, Elizabeth, Nathaniel and John. The family came to New England in 1638 or 1639.

The base of the Triangle is at the Colman Road stretch of the outer ring road, which is one mile south west of the city's inner ring, with the other two sides ‚Äì Earlham Road and Newmarket Road ‚Äì pointing into the city centre. The Unthank Road runs down the middle, forming the backbone and main shopping area of the Triangle. The Golden Triangle's terraces house professionals, families and many students from the nearby University of East Anglia; its friendly atmosphere has resulted in the Golden Triangle being dubbed the Norwich version of London's Notting Hill.  Description  The district lies within the borders of the ancient roads into Norwich: Earlham Road and Newmarket Road. A narrower, neater triangle could be made on the map by replacing Newmarket Road with Unthank Road but this would be to exclude all the terraces lying between Unthank Road and Newmarket Road where the majority of the defining Unthank estate (see below) was situated. Most of the buildings in the area are Victorian terraces and town houses, largely constructed between the 1840s and early 1900s but with some post-World War II social housing. Similar, good-quality Victorian terraces are to be found between Earlham Road and Dereham Road although the streets do not conveniently fall into a triangle. In the first construction of terraced house building, between 1815 and 1835, rows of Georgian houses and back-to-back cottages were built in Crooks Place and Union Place, just outside the city walls near Chapelfield Gardens. Most of this New City was demolished through slum clearance programmes after World War II, but the fine Crescent remains. Then, in the Victorian era, the old rural parish of Heigham was gradually urbanised. This involved the building of some better-grade housing, especially fronting Unthank Road, Newmarket Road and around Mount Pleasant, but most of the accommodation was in the rows of terraced housing behind. The residential area has a cosmopolitan mix of students, professionals, and families. The area is characterised by its terraced housing, pubs and parks which offer small festivals during the summer months such as the GreenStock Festival in Heigham Park. In addition to Chapelfield Gardens (which is separated from the Golden Triangle by the inner ring road) are Heigham Park and the Jenny Lind open space.  History   Toponymy  The name Golden Triangle was coined by Norwich estate agents during the 1980's property boom and the term was used to highlight this popular area for people to live in. As the city slowly crept outwards during the Victorian period, terraced housing was developed on land owned by a few rich landowners. The Heigham Lodge Estate of Timothy Steward (a rich brewer) gave rise to streets either side of the city end of Unthank Road e.g., Grosvenor and Clarendon Roads to the north of Unthank Road, and Trory, Ampthill and Oxford Streets to the south. These were developed from about 1850-1880. Towards the end of this period the south western part of the Triangle, which had been owned by the Dean and Chapter of Norwich Cathedral and was in the parish of Eaton, was developed to give rise to streets such as College Road and Glebe Road. One of the finest streets in the Eaton side of the Triangle was Christchurch Road with its large villas. But the largest block of humbler Victorian terraced housing was on the Unthank estate in the city-side parish of Heigham.  The Unthank estate  Bisecting the Triangle is Unthank Road, which took its name from the family who owned a large estate there in the nineteenth century. The thoroughfare gained its name when William Unthank's son, Clement William Unthank, rode his horse along a sandy lane in order to court his future wife at Intwood. He rode from Heigham House, which had been the home of his father, William Unthank, since 1793. By 1855 Clement William Unthank had inherited Heigham House but moved out to his wife's larger estate at Intwood Hall, a few miles south of the city. The Unthanks owned or leased around 60 acres (figures vary) of land in the parish of Heigham where Heigham House was situated, surrounded by a wooded estate that stretched from present-day Onley Street to around Trinity Street. The house itself was demolished in 1891 but the Unthank estate had begun to be sold off to builders not long after CW Unthank moved to Intwood ‚Äì the process continued by his son Clement William Joseph Unthank. Clement William was a solicitor and it was his detailed contracts that ensured the relative uniformity of the Victorian terraces that were built on Unthank land: 'good white brick', for instance, was specified in CW Unthank's restrictive covenants as were the characteristic arches of gauged bricks around the doors. Unthank did not allow anything to project more than 18 inches from the front of the house By contrast, the Eaton Glebe estate specified red brick and allowed projections such as roof dormers and porches. This explains the different streetscapes on opposite sides of Unthank Road. However, the Unthanks had a minority holding of six acres on the north-west side of Unthank Road so not all belonged to the church; this plot was to give rise to Warwick, Dover, Portland and Lincoln Streets. CW Unthank forbade the sale of alcohol from houses on his land but on corner sites allowed the building of public houses such as The Unthank Arms and The York Tavern.  Second World War  Norwich suffered heavily from bombing during the Baedeker Blitz during April 1942, fortunately many of the large Victorian houses remained, albeit several bombs wiping out whole rows of terraces around the area. Notable examples include 185 Unthank Road onwards, and 180 Earlham Road onwards.  Politics  In May 2016, the majority of residents in the area voted for the Labour Party over the Green Party, increasing Labour's control over City Hall.  Parks  The Golden Triangle contains or is adjacent to three public parks: * Chapelfield Gardens, on the city side of the inner ring road, opened in 1880. Lined with trees first planted in the 18th century by Sir Thomas Churchman. * Heigham Park, one of the five registered sites that form part of a set of the city's public parks. The park was opened in 1924 by Captain A Sandys-Winsch. Sandys-Winsch was responsible for planting the goblet-pruned London planes that line major roads including Colman Road and Earlham Road. * Jenny Lind Park, created in the 1960s after the slum clearances around the badly bombed Vauxhall Street area.

The use of a turbah is compulsory in the Twelver Shia school of Islam, a unique practice of the sect, and many Hadiths mention the benefits of prostration (Sajda) upon soil or an alternative natural material. The most favoured soil is that of Karbala, the site of the death of Husayn ibn Ali; however, soil from anywhere may be used. In the absence of soil, plants or items made from plants may be substituted. This provision has been extended to include the use of paper. Following the instruction from the Quran, Shia Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq stated that \\"prostration must be performed on pure earth or what grows on it, provided that it is not eaten or worn.\\" For example, prostration on paper is permissible because it is made of natural elements grown on earth.Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project. \\"In A Nutshell: Laws and Practices.\\" 1 April 2010. . Muhammad and the use of the turbah According to Abu Sa\`id al-Khudri: ‚ÄúI saw Allah‚Äôs Apostle prostrating in mud and water and saw the marl of mud on his forehead.‚ÄùAl-Bukhari, Sahih (English translation), vol 1, book 12, no. 798; vol. 3, book 33, no. 244 Though Muhammad prayed on the ground, the hadith Sahih al-Bukhari states that \\"Allah‚Äôs Apostle used to pray on Khumra.\\" The idea of \\"absolute consideration\\" states that some kinds of soil, and thus some kinds of places are better than others for prayer. For example, places, buildings, and structures related to Allah and Muhammad are held in the highest regard when it comes to places in which to hold prayer. Significance of Karbala Turbah Karbala, made from (around) the soil of Husayn ibn Ali's grave/tomb Karbala is especially important to Shi‚Äôah Muslims because the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali is considered one of the major dividing lines between Muslims of the time. Husayn is important because of his relationship with Muhammad, and so therefore the dust from Karbala is considered to be one of the most sacred places to pray. Since there are Muslims located all over the world, Shi‚Äôah Muslims have created small clay tablets called mohr or Turbah from the ground of Karbala. However, since it is an issue of honor and respect, Muslims are allowed to prostrate on other earthen materials.Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project. In A Nutshell: Laws and Practices. Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project Team. Web. 1 Apr. 2010. . Significance and symbolism Turbah has a primary meaning of 'dirt', 'earth' or 'soil', identified as the material God used to create the earth and humankind. Turbah also denotes any ground on which one prostrates oneself for prayer. Clean dirt or dust can serve as a substitute for someone who is performing ablutions in the absence of clean water, a practice known as tayammum. Turbah is also used in connection with funerals because of death's association with dust: a dead body eventually turns to earth after death. Turba (or in Turkish) is an Islamic funerary building in a variety of contexts. Sunni views Sunnis reject the use of Turbah as bidah (innovation), noting that according to them neither Muhammad nor his companions ever carried a clay tablet (or any other small item) on which to place their foreheads while in prostration. They also note that many Turbah used by Shia have inscribed invocations to their revered figures, such as 'Ya Hussein' (O Hussein), or 'Ya Zahra' which may be seen by them as Shirk (associating partners with God). In Majmoo' al-Fatawa (Compilation of Fatawa), Ibn Taymiyyah, issued a fatwa that prayer on a Turbah from the site of Imam Husayn's martyrdom (Karbala) is an innovation.

Until recently Llewelyn was little known even in his home area, but has become celebrated as a \\"Welsh Braveheart\\" after a campaign to construct a monument to him in Llandovery. Life The main source for Llewelyn's life is Adam of Usk, who mentions him in his Chronicle as a \\"bountiful\\" member of the Carmarthenshire gentry who used \\"fifteen pipes of wine\\" yearly in his household (implying he was both wealthy and a generous host). He continues by stating that as a result of Llewelyn's support for the rebellion, Henry had him drawn, hung, eviscerated, beheaded and quartered before the gate of Llandovery castle on October 9, 1401 \\"in the presence of his eldest son\\" (it is slightly unclear whether Adam is referring to Henry's son or Llewelyn's son at this point).Sir Edward M Thompson (ed) Chronicon Ad√¶ de Usk, J. Murray, 1876, p.192 After his death his lands were granted to one of Henry's supporters, Gruffydd ap Rhys.The National Library of Wales journal, Volume 21, 1980, p. 3 A more detailed version of the story suggests that Llewelyn was specifically charged with having deliberately led the English forces the wrong way while pretending to guide them to Glynd≈µr.Seward, D. Henry V: the scourge of God, 1988, p.16 Adam, however, states only that Llewelyn \\"willingly preferred death to treachery\\".Sir Edward M Thompson (ed) Chronicon Ad√¶ de Usk, J. Murray, 1876, p.192 Llewelyn is also thought to have had two sons fighting in Glynd≈µr's forces. Genealogy While Llewelyn undoubtedly existed, concrete details of his life are scant (it has been stated that all that is known of him is \\"his name, his politics and his alcohol consumption\\"). However, his name and ancestry may be recorded in later genealogies. His father Gruffydd Fychan (described as \\"lord of Caeo and Cilycwm\\")Rowland, J.

The Principality of Wales in the later Middle Ages: v II, the Structure and Personnel of Government, UWP, 1972, p.66 Gruffydd's wife (and therefore Llewelyn's mother) was said to have been Jonnett, daughter of Gruffydd ap Llewelyn Foethus of Dryslwyn Castle.Rowland, J. The pedigree of the ancient family of Dolau Cothi, 1877, p.10 Lewys Dwnn's Heraldic Visitations, a 16th-century genealogical record of Welsh landowning families, identifies Llewelyn's wife as Sioned, daughter of one of the Scudamores of Kentchurch, and lists his sons as Gwilym (of Llangadog) and Morgan.Lewys Dwnn, Heraldic visitations of Wales and part of the Marches, vol I, 1846, p.230 As one of the Scudamores married Glynd≈µr's daughter Alys, this suggests significant family links between Llewelyn ap Gruffydd Fychan and Glynd≈µr. Dwnn claims that Llewelyn's son Morgan became the Abbot of Strata Florida later in his life, \\"and was a man held in great respect\\". Dwnn also notes Llewelyn's grandsons \\"Llywelyn, Tomas [and] Morgan meibion [sons of] Gwilim ap Llewelyn ap Gruffydd vachan ap Dafydd vongam ap David ap Meurig goch\\"Dwnn, 1846, p.27 as holding Mallaen in the parish of Caeo, and traces the family back to Selyf, King of Dyfed through the lords of Caeo and Cilycwm.

Early life Born in Brandon, Manitoba, to Minnie (n√©e Lang) and George Dinsdale,\\"Memorable Manitobans: Walter Gilbert Dinsdale (1916-1982)\\". Manitoba Historical Society, March 3, 2012. he graduated from Brandon College and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1937 from McMaster University. He received a Master of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1951. Career Prior to entering politics, Dinsdale was a social worker with the Salvation Army, and from 1946 to 1951 served as the director of adult education and assistant professor of social services at Brandon College. Dinsdale enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force on 21 November 1941, to fight in the Second World War. He trained at CFB Borden in Belleville and at No. 2 Service Flying Training School in Ottawa, graduating in 1942. He arrived in Europe on 29 December 1942 and ended his military career in 1945 at the end of the Second World War. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross during World War II for his service as a de Havilland Mosquito night-fighter pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force, having destroyed four enemy aircraft, including the first Mistel composite \\"piggyback\\" aircraft. He also downed V-1 flying bombs, using the wing-tip of the de Havilland Mosquito to knock them off-course. Political career Dinsdale was a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) from 1951 until his death in 1982, being first elected in a 1951 by-election with an upset victory to take a seat previously held by the Liberals. Dinsdale was originally hesitant about running in the by-election, and was fired by Brandon College soon after his nomination. Dinsdale won 56.9% of the vote in that by-election. During his tenure in the House of Commons of Canada, he represented the riding of Brandon for one year in 1951 until it was merged with the neighbouring riding of Souris to form Brandon‚ÄîSouris. He held Brandon-Souris from 1952 until his death in 1982, winning 11 consecutive election victories. At the time of his death he was the Dean of the House - the longest-serving Member of Parliament.\\"Colleagues mourn dean of Commons\\". The Globe and Mail, November 23, 1982. During his period as MP, he was the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Veterans Affairs in 1957, and parliamentary secretary to the same minister in 1960. He then joined the Cabinet of John Diefenbaker as Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources from 1960 to 1963. He was also acting Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys for a few months in 1961. In 1963, while serving as Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources he chaired the \\"Resources for Tomorrow\\" conference, which led to the establishment of a Department of the Environment. Dinsdale worked tirelessly for many causes, including First Nations, international human rights, immigrant Canadians and most notably disabled persons. He was vice-chair of the Special Committee on the Disabled, whose work led to many improvements in services for disabled Canadians, and worked with many international governments and organizations to improve the lives of the disabled everywhere, and in 1981 was Canada's delegate to the United Nations for the International Year of Disabled Persons. Honours The Walter Dinsdale Award, which recognizes outstanding achievement in developing technologies that improve the lives of the disabled, is named in his honour. Dinsdale was awarded a Doctor of Laws degree by Brandon University and a Doctor of Humanities degree from Richmond College in Toronto for his works with disabled people.http://www.canadaveteranshallofvalour.com/DinsdaleWG.htm Death He died from kidney failure in 1982, after suffering a stroke about two months before his death.

A Fenestron (sometimes alternatively referred to as a fantail or a \\"fan-in-fin\\" arrangementLeishman 2006, p. 321.) is a protected tail rotor of a helicopter operating like a ducted fan. The term Fenestron is a trademark of multinational helicopter manufacturing consortium Airbus Helicopters (formerly known as Eurocopter). The word itself comes from the Occitan term for a small window, and is ultimately derived from the Latin word fenestra for window.Prouty, Ray. Helicopter Aerodynamics, Helobooks, 1985, 2004. p. 266.\\"30 Years of Innovation.\\" fenestron.com. The Fenestron differs from a conventional tail rotor by being integrally housed within the tail unit of the rotorcraft and, like the conventional tail rotor it replaces, functions to counteract the torque of the main rotor. While conventional tail rotors typically have two or four blades, Fenestrons have between seven and eighteen blades; these may have variable angular spacing so that the noise is distributed over different frequencies.Corda 2017, pp. 33‚Äì34. By placing the fan within a duct, several distinct advantages over a conventional tail rotor are obtained, such as a reduction in tip vortex losses, the potential for substantial noise reduction, while also shielding both the tail rotor itself from collision damage and ground personnel from the hazard posed by a traditional spinning rotor.Leishman 2006, p. 324. It was first developed for use on an operational rotorcraft by the French company Sud Aviation (now part of Airbus Helicopters), being first adopted upon the A√©rospatiale Gazelle. Since then, the company (and its successors) have installed fenestrons upon many of their helicopters. Other manufacturers have also made limited use of the Fenestron on some of their own products, including the American aerospace corporation Bell Textron and Boeing, the Russian rotorcraft manufacturer Kamov, Chinese Harbin Aircraft Industry Group and Japanese conglomerate Kawasaki Heavy Industries. History An SA 342M Gazelle of the French Army's Light Aviation (ALAT), the first Fenestron-equipped helicopter to enter production Fenestron on a Kawasaki OH-1 reconnaissance helicopter Fenestron on a Kamov Ka-60 at the MAKS Air Show, 2009 The concept of the Fenestron was first patented in Great Britain by the Glaswegian engineering company G. & J. Weir Ltd. It was designed by British aeronautical engineer C. G. Pullin as an improvement to helicopters in British patent number 572417, and is registered as having been filed during May 1943. At that time, Weir had been participated in development work for the Cierva Autogiro Company, who was the holding company for the patent.\\"Publication Number: 572417 - Improvements in helicopters.\\" patentscope.wipo.int, 24 May 1943. In concept, the invention was to function as a viable replacement for the conventional tail rotor arrangement, aiming to produce improvements in both safety and performance upon such equipped rotorcraft.Prouty 2009, p. 266. However, this early work in Britain would not directly lead to any released product by Cierva making use of this innovation. Instead, the Fenestron would only be further developed during the 1960s by an unrelated company. The Fenestron was first practically applied by the French aircraft manufacturer Sud Aviation, who had decided to introduce it upon the second experimental model of their in-development SA 340 (the first prototype had been furnished with a conventional anti-torque tail rotor).Leishman 2006, p. 43. The SA 340's fenestron was designed by French aerodynamicist Paul Fabre; unusually, this unit had its advancing blade set at the top in defiance of conventional practice, but this was reasoned to pose little impact upon this particular helicopter.Prouty 2009, p. 267. Fitted accordingly, on 12 April 1968, the SA 340 became the first rotorcraft to fly using a Fenestron tail unit.Huber, Mike. \\"The Fenestron Turns 50.\\" AIN Online, 12 April 2018. Having been determined to have been satisfactory, this tail unit was retained and was put into production on a refined model of the rotorcraft, which was designated A√©rospatiale SA 341 Gazelle. Over time, the design and performance of the Fenestron has been improved by Sud Aviation and its successor companies, as well as by other companies. During the late 1970s, A√©rospatiale (which Sud Aviation had merged into) launched a second generation all- composite unit; it primarily featured a reversal of the blade's direction of rotation as well as adopting a 20 per cent larger diameter duct for greater efficiency. This unit was fitted onto the A√©rospatiale SA 360 Dauphin, along with its more successful AS365 Dauphin model and its derivatives. While further flight experiments were conducted using an even larger Fenestron upon an SA 330 Puma medium lift helicopter around the same time frame, it was concluded that there were practical limits to how large a helicopter such a configuration would be suited to, and production examples of the Puma retained a conventional tail rotor instead.\\"Fenestron, the Origins: Episode One.\\" Airbus Helicopters, 12 April 2018. During the 1990s, a third generation Fenestron was produced by Eurocopter (A√©rospatiale's multinational successor), equipped with unevenly-spaced blades in order to optimize its noise levels; this unit was first fitted onto the company's EC135 helicopter, and was later incorporated into the designs of the EC130 and the EC145, the latter of which having original been produced for over a decade with a conventional tail rotor.\\"Airbus Helicopters‚Äô new EC145 T2 is certified.\\" Airbus Helicopters, 17 April 2014. During the 2010s, multinational helicopter manufacturer Airbus Helicopters (a rebranded version of the Eurocopter entity) developed the Fenestron further for their new H160, a medium-twin sized rotorcraft; in this revision, the fan duct was intentionally sloped by 12 degrees to achieve improved performance and greater stability when being operated with higher payloads and flown at lower speeds. A Fenestron is normally paired with a larger vertical stabiliser unit that also performs the role of compensating for torque; this configuration has the effect of reducing wear on the Fenestron blades and transmission system, which in turn leads to maintenance savings. Furthermore, the adoption of larger diameter units, while posing some engineering challenges, normally increases their efficiency and decreases their power requirements. Advanced implementations of the Fenestron are provisioned with stators and adjustable weights in order to optimise the blades for a reduction in power required and pitch control loads imposed. During the 2010s, Airbus Helicopters stated that it expected the design of the Fenestron to continue to be refined, in order to suit rotorcraft of increasing tonnages and to enable additional innovations to be made in the field. Through multiple mergers from Sud Aviation to Airbus Helicopters, a considerable number of light, intermediate, and medium weight helicopters have used the Fenestron as an anti-torque tail rotor.

He wrote an autobiography in which he frequently mentions Bartley Lodge. He said :\\"We lived at Bartley and walked out among that beautiful wild forest with the nurses...Bartley belonged to a Major Gilbert, and consisted of eighty English acres, seventy of which was laid down in grass, and produced hay, which was celebrated as the best in the county for the hunters ‚Äî for Lyndhurst was only two miles off where the New Forest hounds were kept. The hay harvest, therefore, was a great concern at Bartley, and when we returned home for each summer holiday the mowing was always just beginning. We (Tom and I) used to attend the mowers all day, and learnt to mow a little, and used to tumble about with Marianne and Fanny in the haycocks, and ride in the loaded wagons to the haystack. It lasted the greater part of our five or six weeks' holidays, as part of the land was always three weeks later in being cut. I have always since thought haymaking the most delightful of sights. We always had our small rakes and forks, and used to try how much we could glean after the wagon. As the whole of this grass land was unenclosed, and surrounded the house, it made a good-sized park, and was full of fine old oaks.\\" Major Edward Gilbert married Jane Ludlow in 1828The Asiatic Journal, Vol 26 1828, p. 134.

In front is the park and forest so that altogether it is a sweet little spot, and I enjoyed sitting here very much. It was a calm, delicious day, the forest bathed in sunlight, the sky a pure pale blue. On my left, close to the wall of the house, is an oak grey with lichens. Here I watched the merry ox-eyes flitting from twig to twig, and tapping them with head downwards and the handsome nuthatch, with his loud clear whistle, running up the boughs like a mouse, and hammering at them with all the concentrated force of his powerful body. In the herbage of the park, I heard the mingled tinkling warble of a dozen goldfinches the sweet song of the robin sounded from tree to tree. From the forest arose a few melodious notes of the thrush, and the loud laugh of the green woodpecker. A pied wagtail with his cheerful \\"chippeet\\" alighted on the roof of the house above me a lark flew across the park, uttering his pretty plaintive cry.

Life Born around 1010 in Lambach an der Traun, Adalbero was the youngest son of Count Arnold II of Lambach in Upper Austria (of the family of the Counts of Formbach) and his wife the Countess Reginlindis.\\"Hl. Adalbero von W√ºrzburg\\", Heilige und Selige, Di√∂ceze W√ºrtzburg Adalbero was the nephew of Bishop Bruno of W√ºrzburg.Lins, Joseph. \\"Diocese of W√ºrzburg.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 June 2018 After his studies in the cathedral school at W√ºrzburg and later in Paris, Adalbero became a canon of W√ºrzburg. In 1045, King Henry III, nominated Adalbero successor to Bruno as Bishop of W√ºrzburg. Bishop Adalbero continued the construction of the new W√ºrzburg Cathedral begun by Bruno,\\"Adalbero von W√ºrzburg\\", √ñkumenisches Heiligenlexikon adding the east crypt and the east choir. He established the \\"Neum√ºnsterkirche\\" (\\"New Minster Church\\") (built between 1058 and 1063). Significant contributions in the reform of ecclesiastical life are attributed to him. He was in close contact with the reformers at Cluny, Gorze and Hirsau. He brought the monk Egbert from Gorze, who proved extremely effective firstly in bringing about the renewal of M√ºnsterschwarzach Abbey and then, through the spread of the subsequent M√ºnsterschwarzach Reforms, in exerting an influence far beyond it, from Harsefeld near Stade in the north to Melk. In 1056 he began the restoration of the abbey of Lambach, founded by his father in the family castle.Bertocchi, Pietro. \\"Beato Adalberone di Wurzburg\\", July 22, 2011 After the death of Henry III that same year, Adalbero, godfather to Henry IV, spent more time attending court, where he gained a reputation as an advisor and mediator. He also intensified his involvement in the councils of the empire and in synods. In 1057 Adalbero re-settled the abbey of St. Peter, Paul and Stephen in W√ºrzburg, until then a college of canons regular, with Benedictines from M√ºnsterschwarzach. In 1066 in W√ºrzburg he performed the marriage ceremony between Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy. Together with other princes he brokered the Peace of Speyer in 1075. In the Investiture Controversy which broke out shortly afterwards, Adalbero took the side of Pope Gregory VII in opposition to Henry IV. Gregory objected to the practice of the appointment of bishops being vested in territorial princes rather than in the papacy. The Synod of Worms however supported Henry against Gregory's ideas and declared the Pope deposed, whereupon Gregory excommunicated Henry, forcing him to go to the Pope at Canossa to seek absolution. Having obtained this, however, the dependency of the bishops on the king was once again reinforced. Adalbero and other princes therefore in March 1077 appointed as anti-king Duke Rudolf of Rheinfelden. Henry IV, hastened to return to Germany, and in the same year besieged Wurzburg. Wurzburg was strategically important because it controlled communications between the rebel areas of Saxony and Swabia.Schoenfeld, Edward. \\"Pleichfeld, Battle of\\", The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology, Volume 1, (Clifford J. Rogers, ed.) Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 130 Having succeeded in raising the citizens against Adalbero, the bishop had to leave the city. King Henry appointed a series of anti- bishops. In 1086 Rudolf of Rheinfelden returned him to W√ºrzburg, but he was soon ejected again. Adalbero rejected all attempts at mediation, saying that he would die rather than yield. At the Synod of Mainz in 1085 therefore he was formally deposed and forced into exile. He remained faithful to the pope, and was sent to his monastery in Lambach. In 1088 Adalberone renounced his episcopal dignity and dedicated the monastery of Komburg, near Schwabisch Hall, in W√ºrttemberg. The following year, he was also co-founder of Zwiefalten Abbey in Swabia. On 6 October 1090 he died in Lambach and was buried in the abbey church which he himself had founded and dedicated. Veneration Soon after his death he began to be venerated as a saint in his Austrian home, and his veneration in M√ºnsterschwarzach is evidenced since the 17th century. In 1883 Pope Leo confirmed Adalbero a saint in the worldwide church. In the \\"Neum√ºnsterkirche\\" in W√ºrzburg since 1948 there has been a glass shrine, by Josef Amberg, containing a thighbone of Adalbero as a relic. Also in W√ºrzburg is the neo-Romanesque St. Adalbero's church. Iconography Adalberone is represented with a church in his hand.

Thalangara Thoppi Thalangara Thoppi is a traditional Muslim cap produced in Thalangara by hand. It was made in homes and was a thriving business generating large-scale employment. These caps even had an overseas market mainly in gulf and African countries. This industry played an important role in the economy of Thalangara. As mechanized production caps brought down market prices, handmade Thalangara caps were not able to compete, and the production has been significantly reduced in recent years. Ship-building industry Thalangara was famous for its small wooden ship (dhow) building industry, well-known in India as well as foreign countries. In the past years a number of ships were built here and sold in various states of India and exported to foreign countries.

Pick, Thomas Pickering, \\"Surgery,\\" Longmans, Green and Company, 1899, Pages 250‚Äì251. Retrieved August 3, 2010. There is no evidence that Coley's toxins have any effectiveness in treating cancer, and use of them risks causing serious harm.  Efficacy  According to Cancer Research UK, \\"available scientific evidence does not currently support claims that Coley's toxins can treat or prevent cancer\\". People with cancer who take Coley's toxins alongside conventional cancer treatments, or who use it as a substitute for those treatments, risk seriously harming their health.  History  Bacterial immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer has been utilized throughout history, with the earliest cases going back to c 2600 BC. Egyptian physician Imhotep treated tumors by a poultice, followed by incision, to facilitate the development of infection in the desired location and cause regression of the tumors. In 13th century, St. Peregrine experienced spontaneous regression of tumor, after the tumor became infected. In the 18th and 19th centuries, deliberate infection of tumors was a standard treatment, whereby surgical wounds were left open to facilitate the development of infection. Throughout the time period, physicians reported successful treatment of cancer by exposing the tumor to infection including the report of French physician Dussosoy who covered an ulcerated breast carcinoma with gangrenous discharge soaked cloth, resulting in disappearance of tumor. Observations of a relationship between infection and cancer regression date back to at least the 18th century.Hobohm, U.: Fever and cancer in perspective, Cancer Immunol Immunother 2001) 50: 391‚Äì396 10.1007/s002620100216 More specifically, observations of an apparent relationship between erysipelas and remission of cancer predate Coley.W. Busch. EinfluŒ≤ von Erysipel. Berliner Klin Wschr 1866. 3: 245‚Äì246. For example, Anton Chekhov, in his capacity as a physician, recorded such a relationship in 1884. Coley started his investigations after the death of one of his first patients, Elizabeth Dashiell, from sarcoma. Dashiell was a close childhood friend of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who later indicated that her death was what first motivated his subsequent funding of cancer research. Frustrated by this case, Coley's subsequent research led him to announce evidence of the apparent relationship between infection and cancer regression, which he published in 1891.Coley WB. Annals of Surgery 1891;14:199‚Äì200 His initial attempts at deliberate infection were mixed, but in 1893 he began combining Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia marcescens, based upon research from G.H. Roger indicating that this combination led to greater virulence.Roger, G.H. S√©ances et M√©m Soc de Biol Paris 1890;2:573‚Äì580 Coley published the results of his work as a case series, making it difficult to interpret them with confidence. According to the American Cancer Society, \\"more research would be needed to determine what benefit, if any, this therapy might have for people with cancer\\". The so-called Coley's Toxins were used against different types of cancer from the year 1893Coley WB. The treatment of malignant tumors by repeated inoculations of Erysipelas, with a report of ten original cases. Am J Med Sci 1893;105:487‚Äì511. through the year 1963. From 1923 on, Parke-Davis was the only source of Coley's Toxins in the United States. In the wake of the thalidomide controversy and the Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962, Coley's Toxins were assigned \\"new drug\\" status by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it illegal to prescribe them outside of clinical trials. Since then, several small clinical trials have been conducted with mixed results.Germs As A Tumor Foe?, from the Los Angeles Times, published February 18, 2008. Accessed March 26, 2008. Coley's Toxins were also produced by the small German pharmaceutical company S√ºdmedica and sold under the trade name Vaccineurin. However, production ceased by 1990 because of a lack of re-approval by German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.  Rationale  There are multiple rationales proposed for how Coley's toxins affect the patient.  Macrophages  One rationale argues that macrophages are either in \\"repair mode\\", furthering the growing of cancer, or in \\"defense mode\\", destroying cancer. However, macrophages are in \\"defense mode\\" only if there is some recognized enemy. As cancer tissue is not recognized as enemy (but as normal body tissue), there is a need to bring more macrophages into \\"defense mode\\" by simulating an infection. The simulated infection results in a real fever. Unlike hyperthermia, real fever not only means heating of the body but also higher activity of the immune system. Thus, fever is seen as a precondition for a therapy using Coley's Toxins to succeed.Hobohm, U.: Fever therapy revisited, British Journal of Cancer (2005) 92, 421 ‚Äì 425 link  Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin  One of the agents in Coley's Toxin that is thought to be biologically active is a lipopolysaccharide which causes fever. The resulting fever from the lipopolysaccaride is thought to increase lymphocyte activity and boosts tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Tsung and Norton in Surgical Oncology reported that the active agent was thought to be interleukin-12, rather than TNF.  Streptokinase  Another hypothesis argues that streptokinase (produced by bacteria of type \\"streptococcus\\" together with plasminogen from the patient) is the active agent of Coley's toxins. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that streptokinase has been associated with successful treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans.  Anti- angiogenesis  In addition to the mechanisms above, Coley's toxins might be antiangiogenic ‚Äì suppressing the formation of new blood vessels which are vital to the growth of tumors.Infection and cancer: the common vein However, angiogenesis is not a biochemical cause by itself but needs external triggers.  Dendritic cells  A robust fever, which occurs in response to Coley fluid, generates inflammatory factors with co-stimulatory activity, which activate resting dendritic cells (DC), leading to the activation of anergic T cells, possibly accomplished through a second process, where physical damage to cancer cells leads to a sudden supply of cancer antigens to the dendritic cell population.  PAMP  Recently (2008), an immunological explanation binding together immunological data with findings about spontaneous regression and epidemiological data indicating a lowered risk to develop cancer later after common infections, has been published.Hobohm U, Grange J, Stanford J: Pathogen associated molecular pattern in cancer immunotherapy, Critical Reviews Immunology (2008) Vol 28, 95‚Äì107 According to this hypothesis, pathogenic substances produced by bacteria, viruses, infectious fungi and other pathogens, but not human tissue, called 'pathogen associated molecular pattern' (PAMP) lead to activation and maturation of tumor-antigen loaded dendritic cells. One PAMP thought to play a major role is the unmethlyated CpG motif found in bacterial DNA. The CpG motif is recognized by toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and can induce a strong TH1 response.  Availability  MBVax Bioscience, a Canadian Biotech company, produces Coley Fluid for research and clinical study. A private biotech company, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, has conducted clinical trials using genetic sequences which may have contributed to Coley's toxin's effectiveness, and was acquired by Pfizer in January 2008. In addition, the Waisbren Clinic in Wisconsin reports they have used Coley's toxin to treat patients since 1972. Coley's toxins are generally not available where approval or licence is required (in particular in the United States and Germany). Drug makers including Pfizer and Sanofi-Aventis are interested in modern versions of Coley's toxins;New York Times: article on Pfizer and Coley Pharmaceutical Group, 5 October 2005 Pfizer has acquired the Coley Pharmaceutical Group, set up in 1997news-medical.net: Pfizer to acquire Coley Pharmaceutical Group, 19 November 2007  Germany  Some specialized medical doctors in Germany apply Coley's toxins to patients. They can do so legally because, in Germany, unapproved medications may be produced, although they may not be sold or given away. Physicians can go to special laboratories and produce Coley's toxins there using their own hands. Coley's toxins may still be applied by a licensed medical doctor, because in Germany there is \\"Therapiefreiheit\\" (\\"therapy freedom\\"), the legal right to apply whichever therapy a physician considers to be appropriate in the light of their medical knowledge. For example, Dr Josef Issels used several unconventional and controversial treatments, including Coley's toxins, for cancer patients in the second half of the 20th century. This kind of therapy is offered as \\"Fiebertherapie\\" (fever therapy) or better \\"Aktive Fiebertherapie\\" (active fever therapy). This term was introduced by E. G√∂hring in 1985. Hyperthermia therapy or thermotherapy is not the same type of treatment, although sometimes incorrectly called \\"fever therapy\\".  Politics  According to an article in the Iowa Orthopedic Journal, Coley's toxins were opposed by the medical establishment despite his reports of good results, because his reports were not believed to be credible.

The division was re-formed in December 1941 in the capital of the Armenian SSR, Yerevan, following the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It was a redesignation of the 474th Rifle Division, which was formed on 14 December 1941 and renumbered the 89th Rifle Division on 26 December 1941.Goff, James F. \\"The Mysterious High-Numbered Red Army Rifle Divisions,\\" Journal of Slavic Military Studies 11 (December 1998): pp. 195-202. Over the course of the war period, the division had a number of commanders, including Colonel Simeon G. Zakyan (who was killed in action in April 1942 during military operations in the Kerch peninsula), Lieutenant-Colonel Andranik Sargsyan, Colonel Artashes Vasilyan, and finally Colonel G. Safaryan, who took over command in February 1943 and would eventually attain the rank of Major General. Hakobyan, Arshavir M., K. Harutyunyan, S. Sargsyan and N.

The Caucasus and the Crimea In August 1942, the 89th Division was dispatched toward the North Caucasus Front, where it took up defensive positions to block the German drive toward Grozny.Glantz, David M. To the Gates of Stalingrad: Soviet-German Combat Operations, April‚ÄìAugust 1942. Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas, 2009, p. 423. From November to December 1942, the unit took part in several fierce battles in the area around the cities of Elekhotvo, Malgobek, and Voznesenskaya and helped bring the German penetration into the Caucasus to a halt. As the Soviet armies shifted to the offensive during the winter of 1942-43, the 89th Division began its gradual advance toward the Crimea. On January 21, 1943, along with other Soviet forces from the Transcaucasian Front, it participated in the capture of Malgobek, Khamedan and a number of other settlements previously held by the Germans. The unit's advance picked up pace in the following month, averaging about 30-40 kilometers a day as it approached the Sea of Azov. The Germans put up a stiff resistance in the Crimea, and in the fighting around the settlement of Novo Jerilka division commander Colonel Vasilyan was killed. The 89th itself suffered heavy casualties but in the following months fresh recruits from Armenia brought it back to full strength, and Vasilyan's successor and the division commander was the able Colonel Safaryan. In September 1943, the division was redeployed and ordered to attack the Axis defensive fortifications on the Taman Peninsula. On September 6, it moved in a northeasterly direction from Novorossiysk and engaged in heavy fighting for several days until the Axis defenses were overwhelmed and the villages of Verkhnebakansk and Taman were liberated on September 18 and October 3, respectively. The 89th distinguished itself in these two battles and was given the honorary title of \\"Tamanskaya\\" (–¢–∞–º–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è; Tamanyan, ‘π’°’¥’°’∂’µ’°’∂).\\" Two soldiers from the division in particular, Senior Sergeants Hunan M. Avetisyan and Suren S. Arakelyan, were noted for the courage they displayed during the fighting and were both posthumously awarded with the medal of the Hero of the Soviet Union.Avetisyan had thrown himself in the direct line of fire of a pillbox in the battle of Dolgaya, killing him, but allowing his squad to advance. On November 21, the 89th Division participated in the Kerch‚ÄìEltigen Operation, an ambitious Soviet military operation involving the landing of amphibious troops onto the Kerch Peninsula. The unit landed near the settlements of Baksi and Adzhimushkay, not far from the Strait of Kerch, and held its position for five months despite withering Axis fire. Beginning in January 1944, it slowly made headway toward Kerch and dislodged the defending Axis troops from one portion of the city. Members of the division distinguished themselves once more, the most prominent of them being field-engineer Jahan S. Karakhanyan, who was killed in December 1943 while trying to establish a new observation post and posthumously awarded with the medal of the Hero of the Soviet Union. In recognition of its efforts, on 24 April 1944 the division was awarded with the Order of the Red Star. In May 1944, the Soviet army began its offensive to retake Sevastopol. The 89th Division was given the objective of capturing the Gornaya Height, which would then open the way to Sevastopol. This was accomplished and the unit subsequently took part in Sevastopol's and the promontory of Kherson's recapture. For the liberation of the Sevastopol the division was bestowed with the Order of the Red Banner. Senior Lieutenants Simeon K. Baghdasaryan and Khoren A. Khachaturyan, and Senior Sergeants Aydin Gh. Harutyunyan, Harutyun R. Mkrtchyan and Vardges A. Rostomyan were awarded with the Order of the Hero of Soviet Union. Poland and Germany In October‚ÄìSeptember 1944, the division was transferred first to Brest and then deployed along the defensive line near Lublin. With the commencement of the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive on January 12, 1945, the 89th Division took part in the general advance into Poland and aided in the liberation of dozens of Polish settlements and towns. By February, it had crossed the Oder River and had taken control of the approach leading to Frankfurt an der Oder and prevented the Germans from breaking through to endanger the Soviet forces now converging onto Berlin. By now, the unit was formally referred to as the \\"Little Armenian Land\\" (Haykakan Malaya Zemlya). With these routes secure, the Soviets now prepared for the capture of Berlin. The 89th Division entered Frankfurt an der Oder on April 16 and was then integrated into the command of the 3rd Shock Army.* Hakobyan, Arshavir M. ‘ø’∏’æ’Ø’°’Ω’µ’°’∂ ’∂’°’≠’°’¨’•’º’∂’•÷Ä’´÷Å ’¥’´’∂’π÷á ‘≤’•’º’¨’´’∂-‘∑’¨’¢’° ‘µ’º’°’Ø’´ ’∑÷Ñ’°’∂’∑’°’∂’°’Ø’´÷Ä 89-÷Ä’§ ‘π’°’¥’°’∂’µ’°’∂ ’Ä’°’µ’Ø’°’Ø’°’∂ ’Ä÷Ä’°’±’£’°’µ’´’∂ ‘¥’´’æ’´’¶’´’µ’°’´ ’¥’°÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂ ’∏÷Ç’≤’´’∂ [From the Caucasus Highlands to Berlin-Elbe: The War Path of the Thrice-awarded 89th Tamanyan Armenian Infantry Division].

Unit veteran Arshavir Hakobyan writes that many of the Armenians of the division expressed a particular eagerness to take part in Berlin's capture on account of the role the German Empire as an ally of the Ottoman Empire during the 1915 Armenian Genocide.Hakobyan. From the Caucasus Highlands to Berlin-Elbe, p. 299. The 89th arrived in the German capital on the night of April 29, along with other elements of the 3rd Shock Army, and deployed the 390th, 400th, and 526th Regiments to take part in heavy street-to-street battles in the Wedding and Reinickendorf districts. The division's artillery was put to good effect to level buildings where lurking panzerfaust teams were holding up the unit's advance into the central part of the city.Hakobyan. From the Caucasus Highlands to Berlin-Elbe, pp. 304-05. On April 30 the division had encountered the twin four-story structures at Flakturm III at Humboldthain Park. Safaryan ordered that they be encircled, and brought his artillery to bear against the flak towers and had his sappers lay a thousand kilograms of explosives at the foundations. Though they caused a great number of casualties, including inflicting concussions against the defenders within, they were unable to penetrate the four meters of iron and concrete walls. But under withering artillery and anti-tank gun fire, on May 2 the commander of the flak towers agreed to surrender.Hakobyan. From the Caucasus Highlands to Berlin-Elbe, pp. 306-08. In several days of fighting the division had overran seven districts. For its role in the capture of Berlin, the 89th was awarded with the Order of Kutuzov 2nd Class and Major General Hmayak G. Babayan was bestowed with the Hero of the Soviet Union. The 89th Rifle Division is recorded to have liberated a total of 900 cities, towns, and villages. It had advanced a distance of 3,700 kilometers in its combat history, and 7,333 of its members were given commendations and awards, nine of whom were decorated with the award of the Hero of the Soviet Union.

Postwar and service in Georgia Until 1957, the division remained the 89th Rifle Division, when it was re-organized and became the 145th Mountain Rifle Division; in 1962 it became the 145th Motor Rifle Division. It was based in Batumi, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, for most of the postwar period as part of the Transcaucasian Military District's 31st Army Corps. It comprised the 35th, 87th, 90th, 1358th Motorized Rifle Divisions and 114th Independent Tank Battalion in 1989-90. The division's installations lined the main roads of Khelvachauri, with at least two barracks blocks, military family housing, and what appears to be a vehicle park or ammunition storage facility which has been hollowed out of gently rolling terrain and camouflaged. There is also a military training area on the coast at Akhalsopeli just south of the Batumi airport.Colin Robinson, \\"Armed Forces in Georgia,\\" V4.0, 2004, www.orbat.com It was renamed the 12th Military Base on May 15, 1992, according to the Collective Security Treaty. In late 1999, the base had 1,790 personnel and included the 35th (Batumi) and the 90th (Khelvachauri) motor rifle regiments; the 809th artillery regiment (Batumi); the 122nd communications battalion (Medjinistzqali); the 61st artillery detachment (Batumi); and the 773rd reconnaissance battalion (Medjinistzqali).‚ÄòThe Army and Society in Georgia‚Äô, October 1999, accessed at http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/doemoff/slavic/pdfs/army1099.pdf An unnamed Russian Defence Ministry official, speaking to ITAR-TASS on 29 March 2004, said that the two bases had reduced their personnel ‚Äì \\"if there were over 2,000 servicemen at each Russian base at the beginning of 2003, now there are at least 1,000 servicemen.\\" The reorganization had also meant the disbandment of units at the bases that did not carry out direct combat missions.ITAR-TASS, \\"RF reduces two-fold personnel of military bases in Georgia,\\" 29 March 2004, via Johnson‚Äôs Russia List (Center for Defense Information) No.8144.

They are producers who create and remix mainly trance music. Career Originally they both lived in Zoetermeer, a city in the Netherlands. In 2008, Minnaard moved to Norway with his fianc√©. Both Hagen and Minnaard still work together with the aid of internet technology and share projects together to create Signum tracks and DJ sets. Their first notable mainstream success was in 1997 with \\"What Ya Got 4 Me\\" (based on Tony de Vit's \\"The Dawn\\"), becoming a club anthem. This song was re-released in 2001 and entered the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. Signum started out on the BPM dance label, and stayed with them until 2003 when the label was disbanded, they then signed a contract with Armada Music soon after. With their success of \\"What Ya Got 4 Me\\", they continued to remix tracks and produce material including; \\"Forever\\", \\"Better Off Alone\\", \\"Take U There\\" and \\"On Stream\\". Their next achievement came when they collaborated with the British producer / DJ Scott Mac, to create \\"Coming On Strong\\". After this, they went to do remixes for ATB and Alice DeeJay. With a large amount of remixes undertaken, they decided to start creating and performing their own material. Their DJ debut was in July 2001 at Gatecrasher in the UK, and they went on to play at various dance venues including 'Godskitchen', 'Gatecrasher', 'Passion' and 'Slinky'. They also played at several music festivals that year. Since their debut, that have played in the countries including Australia, Spain, Japan, Ibiza, Canada and Malaysia. They were signed to Armada Music in the summer of 2003, and released their first single \\"Push Through\\" on the \\"A State of Trance\\" imprint.

The school, administered by the Muskego-Norway School District, lies in southeast Waukesha County, in southeast Wisconsin. The district stretches through the city of Muskego and nearby Norway in Racine County.  History  Muskego High School was constructed in 1956 at the corner of Woods Road and Racine Ave. Its first elected administrator, Arnold Wicklund, oversaw the school's construction.Muskego-Norway Schools Website - MHS History Home Prior to the school's construction, many Muskego children attended school in the Milwaukee School District. In September 2003 the high school was completely remodeled, with added to the building. Facilities that were added include several wings and a performing arts center. A controversial portion of the remodel was the addition of eight 42\\" flat screen TVs for the cafeteria, and the incorrect placement of the supporting wall of the South Gym, which prevents the bleachers from being able to be pulled out entirely during sporting events. The campus also expanded, with approximately of new athletic fields and green space. In April 2016, a referendum was passed to add a new artificial turf field to the nearby, district owned stadium, Inpro Field. Along with this referendum, a new set of bleachers and press box were added to the West side of Inpro Field. On the south side of Inpro Field there was a concession stand added with restrooms and the ticket booths. Most of the field was made possible by the Inpro Corporation, with donations from the Muskego Grid Iron Club (booster club) and fundraising in the community of Muskego.

that must be lifted by a hero. It occurs in Irish mythology and French Grail romances, and hints of it may be found in the Welsh Mabinogion. An example from Irish literature occurs in the Echtrae Airt meic Cuinn (Echtra, or adventure in the Otherworld, of Art mac Cuinn). Recorded in the 14th century but likely taken from an older oral tradition, Echtrae Airt meic Cuinn is nominally about Art, though the adventures of his father Conn of the Hundred Battles take up the first part of the narrative. Conn is High King of Ireland, but his land turns to waste when he marries the wicked B√© Chuma, an unacceptable action for the king. He searches for a way to restore his country by sailing towards the mystical western lands, and eventually washes up on an island inhabited by the niece of the sea god Manannan and her husband. He attends an otherworldly banquet, and when he returns his wife is banished, presumably lifting the curse. In the Arthurian Grail material, the Wasteland's condition is usually tied to the impotence of its leader. Often the infirmity is preceded by some form of the Dolorous Stroke, in which the king is injured tragically for his sins but kept alive by the Grail. In Chr√©tien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail, the Fisher King has been wounded in a misfortune that is not revealed in the incomplete text, and his land suffers with him. He can be healed only if the hero Perceval asks the appropriate question about whom the Grail serves, but warned against talking too much, Perceval remains silent. In the First Continuation of Chr√©tien's work, the anonymous author recounts how Gawain partially heals the land, but is not destined to complete the restoration. Over the course of time romances place less emphasis on the Wasteland and more on the king's wound. In the Lancelot- Grail Cycle the link between the devastated land and the wounded king is not absolute, and in the Post-Vulgate Cycle much more emphasis is placed on King Pellehan's injury by Sir Balin than on the devastation this causes to his kingdom. Scholars of the earlier 20th century devoted much study to the Wasteland motif. In one of the more popular works on the subject, From Ritual to Romance, author Jessie Weston suggested that the origin of the motif lies with an otherwise unattested pagan fertility cult. The book is mostly disregarded today, though T. S. Eliot credited it as the source of the title and the largest single influence on his famous poem The Waste Land. References * Norris J.

Steeplechasing is primarily conducted in Ireland (where it originated), the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Australia and France. The name is derived from early races in which orientation of the course was by reference to a church steeple, jumping fences and ditches and generally traversing the many intervening obstacles in the countryside. Modern usage of the term \\"steeplechase\\" differs between countries. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, it refers only to races run over large, fixed obstacles, in contrast to \\"hurdle\\" races where the obstacles are much smaller. The collective term \\"jump racing\\" or \\"National Hunt racing\\" is used when referring to steeplechases and hurdle races collectively (although, properly speaking, National Hunt racing also includes some flat races). Elsewhere in the world, \\"steeplechase\\" is used to refer to any race that involves jumping obstacles. The most famous steeplechase in the world is the Grand National run annually at Aintree Racecourse, in Liverpool, since its inception in 1836 (the official race was held three years later), which in 2014 offered a prize fund of ¬£1 million.  History  \\"The lads from the village\\" - the first recorded English steeplechase 1830 The steeplechase originated in Ireland in the 18th century as an analogue to cross-country thoroughbred horse races which went from church steeple to church steeple, hence \\"steeplechase\\". The first steeplechase is said to have been the result of a wager in 1752 between Cornelius O'Callaghan and Edmund Blake, racing four miles (6.4 km) cross-country from St John's Church in Buttevant to St Mary's Church (Church of Ireland) in Doneraile, in Cork, Ireland. An account of the race was believed to have been in the library of the O'Briens of Dromoland Castle. Most of the earlier steeplechases were contested cross-country rather than on a track, and resembled English cross country as it exists today. The first recorded steeplechase over a prepared track with fences was run at Bedford in 1810, although a race had been run at Newmarket in 1794 over a mile (1600 m) with five-foot (1.5 m) bars every quarter mile (400 m).Stevens, Peter, History of the National Hunt Chase 1860‚Äì2010, p. 103 and the first recorded steeplechase of any kind in England took place in Leicestershire in 1792, when three horses raced the eight miles from Barkby Holt to Billesdon Coplow and back. The first recorded hurdle race took place at Durdham Down near Bristol in 1821. There were 5 hurdles on the mile long course, and the race was run in three heats. The first recognised English National Steeplechase took place on Monday 8 March 1830. The race, organised by Thomas Coleman of St Albans, was run from Bury Orchard, Harlington in Bedfordshire to the Obelisk in Wrest Park, Bedfordshire. The winner was Captain Macdowall on \\"The Wonder\\", owned by Lord Ranelagh, who won in a time of 16 minutes 25 seconds. Report of the event appeared in the May and July editions of Sporting Magazine in 1830. Steeplechasing by country Europe Great Britain and Ireland In Great Britain and Ireland, \\"steeplechase\\" only refers to one branch of jump racing. Collectively, Great Britain and Ireland account for over 50% of all jump races worldwide, carding 4,800 races over fences in 2008. Jump racing in Great Britain and Ireland is officially known as National Hunt racing. France French jump racing is similar to British and Irish National Hunt races, with a few notable differences. Hurdles are not collapsible, being more akin to small brush fences. Chases often have large fences called bullfinches, a large hedge up to tall that horses have to jump through rather than over. There are also a larger number of cross-country chases where horses have to jump up and down banks, gallop through water, jump over stone walls as well as jump normal chasing fences. Unlike in most countries where nearly all of the horses used for jump racing are thoroughbreds, many of the horses in French jump racing are AQPS (Autre Que Pur Sang), a breed of horse developed in France crossing thoroughbreds with saddle horses and other local breeds. Auteuil in Paris is perhaps the best known racecourse in France for French jump racing. Czech Republic The Velk√° pardubick√° Steeplechase in Pardubice in the Czech Republic is the location of one of the longest steeplechase races in Europe. The first Velka Pardubice Steeplechase was held on 5 November 1874 and it has been hosted annually since.Velka Pardubicka Steeplechase Retrieved 2010-10-12 Rest of the world United States Saint Patrick's Day celebration in the Army of the Potomac. Depicts a steeplechase race among the Irish Brigade, 17 March 1863, by Edwin Forbes. Digitally restored. In the United States, there are two forms of steeplechasing (or jumps racing): hurdle and timber. Hurdle races occur almost always over the National fences, standardized plastic and steel fences that are 52 inches tall, with traditional natural fences of packed pine (Springdale Race Course in Camden, South Carolina) and live hedges (Montpelier, Virginia) in use on a few courses. National fences stand 52 inches tall at the highest point, but are mostly made of synthetic \\"brush\\" that can be brushed through (much like the synthetic fences now used in other countries). The hurdle horse is trained to jump in as much of a regular stride as possible. This allows the horse to maintain its speed upon landing. Since it is not always possible to meet a fence in stride, the horses are also schooled in how to jump out of stride. An out of stride jump can decrease a horse's speed drastically. Hurdle races are commonly run at distances of 2‚Äì3 miles (3‚Äì5 km). Hurdle races occur at steeplechase meets mainly in the Mid- Atlantic and Southeast and on the turf courses of several racetracks ‚Äì Saratoga, Colonial Downs, Penn National, Monmouth Park and others. Timber racing is conducted over solid and immovable wooden rail fences that, in the most extreme case, may reach five feet (1.5 m) high. The distances are longer, ranging from three to four miles (6 km), and the jumping effort required of the horse is much different. Because of the size of the fences and their solid and unyielding construction, a timber horse is trained to jump with an arc, unlike a hurdle racer. An important factor in success at timber racing is for the horse to land in stride, so that it can carry its speed forward on the flat part of the race course. This is harder than in hurdle races because the nature of the obstacle being jumped. If a horse hits a timber fence hard enough, it can bring it almost to a complete stop. Most notable US timber races include the Maryland Hunt Cup in Glyndon, Middleburg Spring Races in Middleburg and the Virginia Gold Cup in The Plains. Timber races currently are not held at any major US tracks (since the fences are not portable) but can be found at almost all steeplechase meets. American jump racing happens in 11 states: Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and New York. The National Steeplechase Association is the official sanctioning body of American jump racing. Steeplechase Times newspaper covers the sport.Steeplechase Times Thomas Hitchcock (1860‚Äì1941) is known as the father of American steeplechasing. In the late 1800s, he built a steeplechase training center on his property in Aiken, South Carolina and trained horses imported from England. No less important are the contributions by fellow Aiken seasonal resident F. Ambrose Clark. Clark held many important chases on his Brookville (Long Island) estate, Broad Hollow, in the 1920s and 1930s. Ford Conger Field was built by F. Ambrose Clark and is the site of the annual Aiken Steeplechase, a part of the Triple Crown in March. The first Steeplechase Meet in Aiken was held March 14, 1930 in Hitchcock Woods. In addition to the Aiken Steeplechase, South Carolina is also home to the Colonial Cup and the Carolina Cup, which is the largest event on the circuit. Both of these races are held in Camden, South Carolina. The Virginia Gold Cup is also among the oldest steeplechase races in the United States, with its first running in 1922. Up until recently, the Gold Cup was a four-mile (6 km) long hurdle race. The length of this race prompted many jokes - such as the jockeys putting marbles in their mouth and spitting one out each lap to keep track of what lap they had completed. Since the Gold Cup moved to the present course, it has been changed into a timber race with a very large purse. Every first Saturday in May, more than 50,000 spectators gather at Great Meadow near The Plains, Virginia (45 miles (72 km) west of Washington, DC). The grass course with high timber fences is often referred to as the \\"crown jewel of steeplechasing.\\" Tennessee State Historian Walter T. Durham's book Grasslands relates the history of the Southern Grasslands Hunt and Racing Foundation, a group that organized the first international steeplechase held on U.S. soil 80 years ago at Grassland Downs, a course located in Gallatin, TN between 1929 and 1932. In addition to holding an inaugural race in 1930, two international steeplechases were held at Grasslands in 1930 and 1931. The winners were awarded a gold trophy designed by King Alfonso XIII of Spain.tennessean.com Gallatin's history The Iroquois Steeplechase event is held in Nashville, Tennessee. Beginning in 1941, with one year off during World War II, the race has been run continuously at Percy Warner Park on a course inspired by Marcellus Frost and designed by William duPont. The Queens Cup Steeplechase is held annually on the last Saturday of April at Brooklandwood, a farm and estate in Mineral Springs, North Carolina, about from Charlotte. The Breeders' Cup Grand National Steeplechase (formerly known as the American Grand National) is held each October at the Far Hills Races in Far Hills, New Jersey and draws about 50,000 spectators for a single day race-meet. It is the richest event in American steeplechasing with a purse of $500,000. During the 1940s and 50s, the Broad Hollow Steeplechase Handicap, the Brook National Steeplechase Handicap and the American Grand National were regarded as American steeplechasing's Triple Crown. Kentucky Downs near Franklin, Kentucky (originally Dueling Grounds Race Course) was built in 1990 as a steeplechase track, with a kidney-shaped turf circuit. At its inception, the track offered some of the richest purses in the history of American steeplechase including a $750,000 race. The track has undergone numerous ownership changes, with steeplechase races playing an on-and-off role (mainly off) in the track's limited live race meets. The Stoneybrook Steeplechase was initiated in Southern Pines, North Carolina on a private farm owned by Michael G. Walsh in 1949 and was held annually in the spring until 1996, with attendance near 20,000. It resumed as an annual spring event at the new Carolina Horse Park in 2001, but was discontinued after 2016. The New York Turf Writers Cup is held each year at Saratoga Race Course, attracting the best steeplechasing horses in the U.S. Australia Five Dock, NSW. Australia has a long history of jumps racing which was introduced by British settlers. In the late 20th century, the eastern states of Queensland and New South Wales shut down jumps racing, while Tasmania ceased jumps racing in April 2007 due to economic unfeasibility and a lack of entries. The jumping season in Australia normally takes place from March until September. (some minor races are held either side of these months). Horses used for steeplechasing are primarily former flat racing horses, rather than horses specifically bred for jumping. There is an emphasis on safety in Australia which has led to a reduction in the size of obstacles. As jumps races take place at flat racing meetings there is also a need for portable jumps. Most chasing occurs on steeple lanes but also includes parts of the main flat racing track. From Easter to May the major distance races occur: The Great Eastern Steeplechase is held on Easter Monday at Oakbank, South Australia drawing crowds of over 100,000, and the Grand Annual, which has the most fences of any steeplechase in the world, is held in May at Warrnambool. Each state holds its own Grand National race: the most prestigious is the VRC Grand National at Flemington run in the winter. The jumping season culminates with the set-weights-and-penalties Hiskens Steeple run at Moonee Valley. The Hiskens is regarded as the Cox Plate of jumps racing. The most famous Australian horse in the field was Crisp, who was narrowly beaten by the champion Red Rum in the 1973 English Grand National. Crisp subsequently beat Red Rum at set weights. Oju Chosan has won Japan's Nakayama Grand Jump five consecutive times. Jumps racing was set to end in Victoria after the 2010 season. In September 2010, having satisfied a limit on the maximum number of deaths among starting horses, hurdle racing was granted a 3-year extension by Racing Victoria. A decision regarding steeplechase was postponed until October 2010 when a program for the 2011 season only was granted. Since 2012, both hurdle races and steeplechases have been approved by Racing Victoria. Japan The Nakayama Racecourse is Japan's premier steeplechase racetrack. The two most prestigious races are the Nakayama Daishogai (first held in 1934) and the Nakayama Grand Jump (held since 1999). Both races have a prize money of about 140 million yen, the similar to Aintree's Grand National. The Hanshin Racecourse and the Kokura Racecourse also host graded steeplechase races.

The NSW government officially shut down jumps racing in 1997 after a bill was put through linked with bird tethering, but by that stage there had not been regular jumps race meetings in NSW since World War II, when it was ceased due to the war efforts, except for a handful of exhibition events on an annual basis in the 1980s. In 2012, the VRC Grand National Steeplechase was worth $250,000 and the Warrnambool Grand Annual Steeplechase was worth $252,000. Jumps racing is opposed in Australia by groups including the animal rights organisations the RSPCA Australia, Animals Australia, and Animal Liberation (South Australia), and by political parties such as The Greens. Eventing The equestrian sport of eventing had a steeplechase phase, which was held in its CCI 3 Day event format. This phase is called cross country phase B when in the context of eventing. There was a roads and tracks phase, a steeplechase phase, a second, faster roads and track phase and finally the cross country jumps course. Now only the cross country jumps course remains (changes were due to space required for the additional courses and logistics). Unlike the racing form, which is far closer to the sport of hunting, the horses do not race each other over the course, but rather are required to come within a pre-set \\"optimum time period.\\" Penalty points are added to the competitor's score if they exceed or come in well under the optimum time. While phase B obstacles are similar to those found on actual steeplechase courses, the cross country obstacles for phase D are usually extremely varied, some being topped with brush as in steeplechasing, others being solid, others are into and out of water and others are over ditches. There are often combinations of several fences to test the horse's agility. The variety in obstacles is used to make the horse demonstrate agility, power, intelligence, and bravery. The long format was phased out at the FEI level between 2003 and 2008, but several countries continue to run long format events at the national level, including the US, Great Britain, and Canada.

There are small foci of grey matter heterotopia in the corpus callosum, deep to the dysplastic cortex. (double arrows) Gray matter heterotopias are neurological disorders caused by clumps of gray matter (nodules of neurons) located in the wrong part of the brain. A grey matter heterotopia is characterized as a type of focal cortical dysplasia. The neurons in heterotopia appear to be normal, except for their mislocation; nuclear studies have shown glucose metabolism equal to that of normally positioned gray matter.uhrad.com - Neuroradiology Imaging Teaching Files The condition causes a variety of symptoms, but usually includes some degree of epilepsy or recurring seizures, and often affects the brain's ability to function on higher levels. Symptoms range from nonexistent to profound; the condition is occasionally discovered as an incidentaloma when brain imaging performed for an unrelated problem and has no apparent ill effect on the patient. At the other extreme, heterotopia can result in severe seizure disorder, loss of motor skills, and mental retardation. Fatalities are practically unknown, other than the death of unborn male fetuses with a specific genetic defect. Preliminary Material: Neurological Development of the Human Fetus The development of the brain in the human fetus is extraordinarily complex and is still not fully understood. Neural matter originates in the outer, ectodermic layer of the gastrula; thus, it originates from the cell layer primarily responsible for skin, hair, nails, etc., rather than from the layers that develop into other internal organs. The nervous system originates as a tiny, simple open tube called the neural tube;For a good illustration of the neural tube, see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.figgrp.2886 the front of this tube develops into the brain (and retinas of the eye), while the spinal cord develops from the very back end. Neurons begin to form early, but most of them become structural rather than active nerve cells. The brain generally forms from the inside-out, especially in the case of the neocortex. The difficulties arising from this are readily apparent, as each successive layer of cells must travel through the previous layer to reach its destination. Therefore, nervous tissue develops ladders made of radial glial cells that neurons climb, through the previous layers, to reach their proper destination. Some destinations, such as the cerebral cortex, even have \\"placeholder\\" neurons that travel up the ladder to form a structure; when the final neurons germinate, they find a correct placeholder and then the placeholder cell dies. Heterotopia The complexity of neural development makes it fraught with opportunities for error. Grey matter heterotopia\\"Hetero\\" is from Greek \\"different\\" (e.g., heterosexual = \\"different sex\\") and \\"topia\\" from \\"place\\" (e.g., utopia = \\"ideal place\\"); thus, heterotopia means \\"different place\\". is such an example. It is believed that gray matter heterotopia are caused by arrested migration of neurons to the cerebral cortex; that is, when neurons that are supposed to form part of the cerebral cortex.Many parts of the brain, in addition to the cerebrum, contain grey matter. fail to climb to the end of their ladder correctly and are permanently situated in the wrong location. Gray matter heterotopia are common malformations of cortical development classed as neuronal migration disorders. Heterotopias are classed in two groups: nodular and diffuse. Nodular types are subependymal and subcortical; diffuse types are termed band heterotopias. Affected patients are generally divided into three groups, depending on the location of the formation: subependymal, subcortical, and band heterotopia. In addition, especially with heterotopia that are genetically linked, there are gender differences, men suffering more severe symptoms than women with similar formations. In general, band heterotopia, also known as double cortex syndrome, are seen exclusively in women; men with a mutation of the related gene (called XLIS or DCX) usually die in utero or have a much more severe brain anomaly. Symptoms in affected women vary from normal to severe developmental delay or mental retardation; the severity of the syndrome is related to the thickness of the band of arrested neurons. Nearly all affected patients that come to medical attention have epilepsy, with partial complex and atypical absence epilepsy being the most common syndromes. Some of the more severely affected patients develop drop attacks. Periventricular or subependymal Periventricular means beside the ventricle, while subependymal (also spelled subepydymal) means beneath the ependyma; because the ependyma is the thin epithelial sheet lining the ventricles of the brain, these two terms are used to define heterotopia occurring directly next to a ventricle. This is by far the most common location for heterotopia. Patients with isolated subependymal heterotopia usually present with a seizure disorder in the second decade of life. Subependymal heterotopia present in a wide array of variations. They can be a small single node or a large number of nodes, can exist on either or both sides of the brain at any point along the higher ventricle margins, can be small or large, single or multiple, and can form a small node or a large wavy or curved mass. Symptomatic women with subependymal heterotopia typically present with partial epilepsy during the second decade of life; development and neurologic examinations up to that point are typically normal. Symptoms in men with subependymal heterotopia vary, depending on whether their disease is linked to their X-chromosome. Men with the X-linked form more commonly have associated anomalies, which can be neurological or more widespread, and they usually suffer from developmental problems. Otherwise (i.e., in non-X-linked cases) the symptomology is similar in both sexes. Focal subcortical Subcortical heterotopia form as distinct nodes in the white matter, \\"focal\\" indicating specific area. In general, patients present fixed neurologic deficits and develop partial epilepsy between the ages of 6 and 10. The more extensive the subcortical heterotopia, the greater the deficit; bilateral heterotopia are almost invariably associated with severe developmental delay or mental retardation. The cortex itself often suffers from an absence of gray matter and may be unusually thin or lack deep sulci. Subependymal heterotopia are frequently accompanied by other structural abnormalities, including an overall decrease in cortical mass. Patients with focal subcortical heterotopia have a variable motor and intellectual disturbance depending on the size and site of the heterotopion. Band form Like focal subcortical heterotopia, \\"band\\" heterotopia form in the white matter beneath the cortex, but the gray matter is more diffuse and is symmetric between the hemispheres. On imaging, band heterotopia appears as bands of gray matter situated between the lateral ventricle and cerebral cortex and separated from both by a layer of normal appearing white matter. Band heterotopia may be complete, surrounded by simple white matter, or partial. The frontal lobes seem to be more frequently involved when it is partial. Patients with band heterotopia may present at any age with variable developmental delay and seizure disorder, which vary widely in severity. Subcortical band heterotopia, also known as ‚Äúdouble cortex‚Äù syndrome, refers to a band of subcortical heterotopia neurons, located midway between the ventricles and the cerebral cortex. The disorder is seen primarily in females and typically causes varying degrees of mental retardation and almost all of them have epilepsy. Approximately two thirds of patients with epilepsy ultimately develop intractable seizures. MRI of the brain in subcortical band heterotopia demonstrates two parallel layers of gray matter: a thin outer ribbon and a thick inner band, separated by a very thin layer of white matter between them. The severity of epilepsy and developmental delay is directly correlated with the degree of migration arrest, as indicated by the thickness of the subcortical band heterotopia. Subcortical band heterotopia is caused by mutations in the microtubule-associated DCX gene. The DCX protein is thought to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization and stability of microtubules, necessary for neuronal motility. The malformation is seen only in females, as the gene is found on the X-chromosome. Since there are two X chromosomes in females, after X-inactivation, only some neurons lose doublecortin function. These neurons with the mutant DCX gene fail to migrate into the cortex and thus form the underlying heterotopic band, while neurons which express the normal gene successfully migrate out to the cortical plate. Males with DCX mutations develop classical lissencephaly. Diagnosis Detection of heterotopia generally occurs when a patient receives brain imaging‚Äîusually an MRI or CT scan‚Äîto diagnose seizures that are resistant to medication. Correct diagnosis requires a high degree of radiological skill, due to the heterotopia's resemblance to other masses in the brain. Treatment When seizures are present in any forms of cortical dysplasia, they are resistant to medication. Frontal lobe resection provides significant relief from seizures to a minority of patients with periventricular lesions. Prognosis In general, gray matter heterotopia is fixed in both its occurrence and symptoms; that is, once symptoms occur, it does not tend to progress. Varying results from surgical resection of the affected area have been reported. Although such surgery cannot reverse developmental disabilities, it may provide full or partial relief from seizures. Heterotopia are most commonly isolated anomalies, but may be part of a number of syndromes, including chromosomal abnormalities and fetal exposure to toxins (including alcohol).

The foremost version of the event is the 3000 metres steeplechase. The 2000 metres steeplechase is the next most common distance. The 1900 Olympics featured a 2500 metres steeplechase and a 4000 metres steeplechase, and a 2590 metres steeplechase was held at the 1904 Olympics. A lap scoring error caused the 1932 Olympics to feature an approximately 3460 meter steeplechase. A 1000 metres steeplechase is occasionally used in youth athletics. History Steeplechase race, Celtic Park, N.Y., through water 2008 World Junior Championships, in Bydgoszcz The event originated in Ireland.http://www.steeplechasemuseum.org/history Horses and riders raced from one town's steeple to the next. The steeples were used as markers due to their visibility over long distances. Along the way runners inevitably had to jump streams and low stone walls separating estates. The modern athletics event originates from a cross country steeplechase that formed part of the University of Oxford sports (in which many of the modern athletics events were founded) in 1860. It was replaced in 1865 by an event over barriers on a flat field, which became the modern steeplechase. It has been an Olympic event since the inception of the modern Olympics, though with varying lengths. Since the 1968 Summer Olympics, steeplechase in the Olympics has been dominated by Kenyan athletes, including the current gold medal streak since 1984 and a clean sweep of the medals at the 1992 and 2004 Games. The steeplechase for women is 3,000 metres long, but with lower barriers than for the men. A distance of 2,000 metres, with a shorter water jump, was experimented with before the current race format was established. It made its first major championship appearance at the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. In 2008, women's 3,000 metres steeplechase appeared for the first time on the Olympic tracks in Beijing (see Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Women's 3000 metres steeplechase). Other divisions including masters athletics and youth athletics run 2,000 metres distances. The format for a 2,000 metre steeplechase removes the first two barriers of the first lap. The steeplechase at the 1932 Olympics was run over approximately 3460 metres due to a lap scoring error. Format A 3,000 metres steeplechase is defined in the rulebook as having 28 barriers and seven water jumps. A 2,000 meters steeplechase has 18 barriers and five water jumps. Since the water jump is never on the track oval, a steeplechase \\"course\\" is never a perfect 400 metres lap. Instead the water jump is placed inside the turn, shortening the lap, or outside the turn, lengthening the lap. The start line moves from conventional starting areas in order to compensate for the different length of lap. When the water jump is inside, the 3,000 metre start line is on the backstretch (relative to the steeplechase finish). When the water jump is outside, the 3,000 metre start line is on the home stretch. The 2,000 metre start line reverses that pattern and uses the amount of compensation.

The school is housed in three buildings, the elementary school, middle school and high school, all located within a square block of one another. The Waverly School qualifies as an independent school. Accreditations The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and is a provisional member of the California Association of Independent Schools. Waverly Elementary School Waverly‚Äôs elementary school includes grades young kindergarten through six and is located at 67 West Bellevue Drive, Pasadena, California. The elementary school is part of the larger Waverly community, which includes the middle and high schools, located on their own campuses within walking distance of each other. The young kindergarten (YK) class is an early childhood program licensed by the California Department of Social Services. YK students must be aged at least three years nine months at the beginning of the school year; most YK students are four years old. There is a maximum of seventeen students in the class, with a head teacher and two assistant teachers. The YK assistant teachers each work part-time in the YK day care program and in the regular school day program. First through sixth grade classes are in self-contained classrooms with a head and an assistant teacher. The kindergarten class has two co-head teachers. The average class size is 24 students, maintaining a 12:1 or lower student-teacher ratio. Beginning in first grade, most classes are multi-age in dual-grade configurations (e.g., 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, and 5/6). There is a range of ages and developmental levels in each class. Waverly Middle School These students are in seventh and eighth grade and work with five core teachers who teach multiple subjects throughout the school day. Although students do not receive traditional letter grades, students and parents receive information about academic progress. Every six weeks, teachers prepare a report about student performance in each class. At the end of each semester, teachers write a detailed narrative assessment that reflects on individual student progress. Additionally, because of the small student to teacher ratio, teachers are able to confer with one another to discuss the academic, social, and behavioral needs of the students. Waverly High School The high school has about 100 students in grades nine through twelve. At the beginning of the 2007‚Äì2008 school year, the high school moved to the new Dean A. and Janice E. Scarborough Campus, a facility consisting of seven buildings. The buildings on the new campus are refurbished houses built before 1940. The Pasadena Historical Society helped to fund the moving of three buildings from their original site so that the buildings could be preserved and put to use. Graduation requirements exceed the minimum entrance requirements of the University of California. The school offers a range of courses, including Advanced Placement courses; all courses are approved by the University of California. Waverly is registered with the California Interscholastic Federation.

Carmela goes to see Mr. Wegler at the school and agrees to have dinner with him the following evening. After dinner they go to his home and have sex. Carmela meets Father Phil Intintola; he reminds her that she made a commitment to her husband before God. However, she continues the affair, even after making formal confession. One evening with Wegler she abruptly leaves, saying she is upset about A.J.‚Äôs academic performance, and also troubled by the laws of the Church. The next day, Wegler pressures A.J.'s English teacher to raise his grade for a poorly written term paper. After several rounds of sex after which Carmela talks each time about A.J., Wegler concludes that she is just using him to get her son better grades, and tells her he wants to end the relationship. Carmela is deeply hurt and, after an argument, storms out. Her last words are, \\"You'd better watch your step.\\" When her father suggests that she look for other men, Carmela replies that, as Tony's wife, her motives will always be distrusted. Tony B tries to adjust to civilian life. Kim, his Korean-American employer, who was pressured by Tony Soprano into giving him a job, is hostile. But he changes his mind when he realizes how hard Tony B is working, both on the job and in his efforts to pass the state massage board exam. Kim offers to partner up with him, as he has an empty storefront in West Caldwell. Tony B passes the exam and begins work on the storefront, preparing it for business. But then he comes across a bag containing $12,000, thrown away by fleeing drug dealers, and goes on a self-destructive tear, wasting most of the money on gambling and expensive clothes. Kim visits the store and encourages him to keep on working. Tony B, sleepless, and under physical and emotional pressure, snaps, and beats him up. With Tony at Nuovo Vesuvio, Tony B hints that he screwed up and asks if he still needs someone to cover the airbag scheme. \\"It's hard doing business with strangers,\\" responds Tony, smiling.

The commander-in-chief of the Ohio Army National Guard is the governor of the state of Ohio. If the Ohio Army National Guard is called to federal service, then the President of the United States becomes the commander-in-chief. The military commander of all forces in the State of Ohio is the Adjutant General, Major General John C. Harris, Jr. is responsible for the command of 17,000 members, preparedness and readiness, installation management, and budget of the Ohio National Guard. The current Assistant Adjutant General for Army, with responsibility for overseeing the Ohio Army National Guard training and operations, is Colonel Daniel Shank. The current Assistant Adjutant General for Air is Brigadier General James R. Camp with responsibility for overseeing the Ohio Air National Guard. (The above command appointments are current as of 10/25/19.) Ohio Army and Air National Guard units can be mobilized at any time by the governor of the State of Ohio upon declaration of a state of emergency or by the presidential order to supplement regular armed federal forces. Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and temporary duty assignment (TDY), but only as part of their respective units. However, there has been a significant number of individual activations to support military operations since 2001. The legality of this policy has been a source of contention in some quarters. The Ohio Military Reserve and the Ohio Naval Militia constitute Ohio's state defense force, and augment the Ohio National Guard during stateside missions, especially when units of the National Guard are federalized. The Ohio National Guard is made up of Citizen-Soldiers, meaning that the members of the National Guard lead civilian lives in addition to their duties as a soldier. As a Citizen-Soldier members only train with their National Guard Units for roughly two days a month (one weekend), and two weeks of training in the summer, called Annual Training (AT).  History   Militia  In 1803 every state had a militia, so when Ohio was first formed as a state a militia for the state was created. This Ohio Militia was an important factor in the state's early history. The militia helped to subdue the Native American population in the state and aided in the War of 1812. After this the militia experienced a decline and lost funding. This became a large problem at the onset of the Civil War seeing as Ohio's militia was extremely underdeveloped and the Governor had to ask communities to supply units. Once more the Ohio Militia experienced a decline after the Civil War.  The Dick Act  In 1903 the federal government enacted the Dick Act. The Dick Act is responsible for creating the National Guard. The law was enacted mainly because of the poor condition of state militias, and allowed the federal government to nationalize the National Guard and send them overseas or elsewhere in the country to assist with the Active Military.  World War I  In 1917 the draft was instituted in each state because of the Selective Services Act. The enactment of this law greatly expanded the Ohio National Guard and gave rise to the 37th Division. Dubbed the \\"Buckeye Division,\\" they were sent to France as a part of the American Expeditionary Force. The 37th gained a reputation as a \\"crack unit\\" by displaying great combat effectiveness during multiple battles, including the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and the St. Mihiel Salient. This led to the unit being rated as one of the best six American Divisions by the German General Staff.  World War II  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor the United States entered the Second World War. During this time the 192nd Tank Battalion was stationed in the Philippines. This unit became a large part of the \\"Battling Bastards of Bataan,\\" who attempted to stem the invasion of Japanese forces in the Philippines. The 192nd was put into POW camps when the Japanese took the islands in 1942, along with the remainder of the US forces there. The \\"Buckeye Division\\" served during the battle of Guadacanal, New Guinea and when the Philippines were re-taken. Despite suffering thousands of casualties throughout the war, the \\"Buckeye Division\\" had seven soldiers who were awarded the Medal Of Honor for their heroic actions.  Korea  During the Korean War there were no major units within the Ohio National Guard that were deployed to the conflict. Instead the \\"Buckeye\\" Division was mobilized as a training division in Fort Pol, Louisiana. It was also during this time that the Air Force broke off from the Active Duty Army which subsequently created the Air National Guard.  Vietnam  The Vietnam War saw many Ohio Army and Air National Guard units deployed in order to help protect South Vietnam from communism. During this time the Guard also helped local authorities back in the United States. This led to the Guard helping quell a rebellion at the Ohio Penitentiary, and help stop violence during the trucker's strike in 1970, and eventually the Kent State Shootings.  Kent State Shootings  On May 1, 1970 a protest of the Vietnam War was held on the campus of Kent State University. This protest led to reports of students lighting bonfires in streets and throwing bottles at police cars. There were also reports of violence between police and students. This led to reinforcements being called for from neighboring towns and the Governor by the mayor of Kent, Leroy Satrum. This led to the Ohio National Guard being sent to Kent State on the night of May 2, 1970. These Guardsmen stationed themselves at the then burned down ROTC adjacent to the commons of the university. On May 4, 1970 a protest took place on the commons of the university. The National Guard and police asked the protesters to disperse and when they refused the Guardsmen, armed with M -1 military rifles, pushed the group towards a football practice field. The protesters then threw rocks at the Guardsmen, who following that retreated up to the top of a hill where they began to fire shots. Some Guardsmen fired in the air while others fired directly into the crowd of protesters, killing four of them. (For more information see Kent State Shootings)  Operation Desert Storm  During Operation Desert Storm the Ohio National Guard mainly supported the larger military force. The Guard sent small units and provided transportation and supplies to the war front. Following Desert Storm Ohio National Guard units were mobilized to continue the military presence in the region.  Post 9-11  Following the events of September 11th, 2001 the US Military was sent to the Middle East. The Ohio National Guard also took part in these operations, sending individuals and small units to assist the larger military force there. In the fall of 2011 though, the Ohio National Guard sent the 37th infantry division (the 'Buckeye' Division) in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. This was the largest overseas mobilization since World War II for the Guard. The Ohio National Guard has also assisted in more domestic tragedies, having sent assistance during Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Harvey, and Hurricane Irma. Assistance was also sent to Puerto Rico following the disaster caused by Hurricane Maria. In fall of 2019 legislation creating the Ohio Cyber Reserve was passed.  Accolades  The Ohio National Guard participates in an annual event put on by the Army called the Army Communities of Excellence. This program evaluates different organization's in the military based upon the performance of an Army installation run by the organization. The Ohio National Guard has won this award multiple times. The Guard won in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009. 2015, and in 2018. The Ohio National Guard also won Rookie of the Year in 2002.

Johnson Health Science and Engineering Magnet Middle and High School is a public seven-year magnet school in downtown Augusta, Georgia, United States, drawing students from grades six through twelve from all parts of Richmond County. Academics A. R. Johnson is accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Aside from the standard college preparatory academic courses, Johnson offers specialized training in health sciences and engineering, and the opportunity for vocational training and dual high school/college enrollment for health science students. The school has consistently been regarded as one of the best in Georgia, regularly ranking among the top three best schools in the state. Awards and recognition The school received the Blue Ribbon Award in 2003 and received the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Georgia Achievement Platinum Award. In 2007 and 2009, it received a silver medal and was listed as one of the top schools in the nation by US News & World Report. History The school opened in 1892 as Mauge Street Grammar School, taking on the name \\"A. R. Johnson Junior High School\\" in 1937. From 1945 to 1949, it served as a senior high school, and in 1956 a new building was erected to serve as the junior high school. In 1980, the school was established as an examination school. In 1980‚Äì81, A. R. Johnson Junior High School became \\"A. R. Johnson Health Professions High School\\". Under its new name, it served as a pilot program, using funds from a Magnet Implementation/Planning Grant. In 1984, feasibility studies were undertaken to introduce an engineering program at the school, which began in 1985. On September 7, 2008, the school opened a new building that included an open-air cafeteria, an observatory deck overlooking the school's library, and its first elevator. The new building featured a dome skylight and modern layouts. The old gymnasium was converted into an indoor grow house. The expansion project was completed in 2008, and seventh and eighth graders began attending the school in August 2009. In 2015 a new wing was added for sixth graders, in August 2015 sixth graders began attending. Namesake The school is named for Augustus Roberson Johnson (1853‚Äì1908), an African American teacher in Augusta during the late 19th century. A. R. Johnson's mascot The school's mascot is the panther. Male sports teams is known as the Panthers, and female teams are known as the Lady Panthers. During the latter half of the 2008-2009 school year, a mural of the mascot was painted on the wall on the hall nearest the office at the front of the building. It is visible from the street. The mural was painted and initially sketched by a student from the class of 2009, Corey Harris. Student activities Athletics Unlike other local magnet schools C.T. Walker and Davidson, Johnson participates in several district competitive sports, among them track, cross country, soccer, golf, tennis, and volleyball. The school does not participate in the more traditional high school sports of football, basketball, and baseball.

History The village of Monostor, located on Siga, was constantly flooded and its population thus settled at the location of Baƒçki Mono≈°tor some time before 1722. The parish of Monostor was established in 1722. The Catholic church of St. Peter and Paul was founded in 1752, and reconstructed in 1806. The first school was opened in 1826. Prior to World War I, the village was inhabited by ≈†okci, Hungarians, Germans and Romani, and during the war the locals were mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army.

Features Baƒçki Mono≈°tor is located on a small peninsula surrounded by the Danube backwaters and channels that can be reached only by passing over the bridges - hence the name \\"Village on the 7 Danube.\\" A bridge is placed at the entrance to the village from the direction of Sombor - the so-called \\"Pislin bridge\\" which is on the Grand Baƒçka Canal, the other is at the entrance to the village from the direction of Bezdan - pontoon bridge, also over the Grand Canal and the third is placed at the southwestern side of the village over Canal Danube-Tisa- Danube, so called \\"Gypsy bridge\\" that connects Baƒçki Mono≈°tor with his woods and cottage settlements. Previously, there was another bridge in the district near mono≈°torski road to Sombor, set over the Grand Canal which connected the former estates and farms to the main road, but was destroyed during World War II. There are also marked cycling routes - the via pacis Panonie. As for coming to Baƒçki Mono≈°tor by water, it is the most attractive because it offers the possibility of enjoying the countless beauties of nature and the surrounding villages. In the past, the not so distant, Baƒçki Mono≈°tor had a so-called Danube port for barge and small boats. With the arrival of modern times, regulation of the Danube river channel and construction of defensive embankments for flood protection, the village was temporarily paralyzed the flow of the Danube, so called. Here is located one of the branches of the Danube, called Dunavac, which is now somewhat farther away from the village. The program of revitalizing the Special Nature Reserve \\"Gornje Podunavlje\\" will provide training and a series of Shaft of the Danube for navigation of boats and ships, both in the economic, as well as the purpose of development of rural tourism and tourism in general.

It is located at the confluence of the rivers Schwarzach and Main in Bavaria. Carolingian nunnery The abbey, dedicated to the Holy Saviour, the Virgin Mary and Saint Felicity, was founded before 788 as a nunnery. It was a private foundation of the Carolingian ruling house: the abbesses were daughters of the imperial family, for example Theodrada (d. 853), a daughter of Charlemagne. After the death of the last Carolingian abbess, Bertha, in 877, the nuns left the abbey and it was taken over by Benedictines from \\"Megingaudshausen\\". First Benedictine monastery M√ºnsterschwarzach became a centre of monastic reform during the 12th century, when Bishop Adalbero of W√ºrzburg, who was in close contact with the reform movements of Cluny, Gorze and Hirsau, appointed Egbert of Gorze as abbot. Egbert not only reformed and renewed the spiritual life of M√ºnsterschwarzach but then, through the spread of the subsequent M√ºnsterschwarzach Reforms, exerted an influence far beyond it, from Harsefeld near Stade in the north to Melk and Lambach in the south. In the 18th century a Baroque basilica was commissioned from Balthasar Neumann, with frescoes in the cupolas by Holzer; it was dedicated in 1743 by Bishop Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn. In 1803 the abbey was dissolved in the course of the secularisation of Bavaria. The monastic buildings were auctioned off. In 1805 the abbey church was sold and deconsecrated. In 1810 the buildings were struck by lightning and severely damaged by the subsequent fire, and between 1821 and 1827 the remains of the church were entirely demolished, and those of the monastic buildings largely demolished. Second Benedictine monastery In 1913 the remains of the old abbey were re-acquired by the Missionary Benedictines, along with the necessary land to support it. The first abbot after the restoration was Dom Placidus Vogel (1914-1937). He was followed by Dom Burkhard Utz (1937-1959) and Dom Bonifaz Vogel (1959-1982), a nephew of Abbot Placidus. The monumental abbey church with its four towers was built between 1935 and 1938, when it was dedicated. The architect was Albert Bosslet. Between 1941 and 1945 the abbey was confiscated by the National Socialists and used as a military hospital. Although the monastic community had been expelled, some monks were able to remain as workers in the hospital. It reopened after the war. The present abbot is Michael Reepen OSB. The abbey has two dependent monasteries. Christ the King Priory in Schuyler, Nebraska (USA) was established in 1935; Damme Priory (Germany) in 1962.

The proposal was introduced to the Popular Front government of France in 1936, and aimed to address the issue of longstanding French colonialism in Algeria along with the persistent disenfranchisement of the territory's Muslim majority. The proposal would have enabled a small number of Algerian Muslims to obtain full French citizenship while still allowing them to be subject to Muslim law on some social issues (such as marriage/divorce, custody, inheritance). An earlier policy, the s√©natus- consulte legislation of 1865, had enabled Muslims to apply for French citizenship only if they renounced the provisions of Islamic personal status law, something that the vast majority of Muslims refused to do since many regarded doing so as the equivalent of apostasy. The Blum-Viollette proposal of 1936 would have granted these benefits to the highly educated, as well as to those Algerian men who served in the French military, with the plan to widen the benefits to other Muslims at a later date. The proposal did not apply to Algerian Jews, who had gained French citizenship following the Cr√©mieux Decree of 1870. The proposal never made it to the French Chamber of Deputies for a vote because of the massive protest staged by French settlers in Algeria. It was the failure of this and other such proposals that eventually led to the emergence of violent resistance on the part of the Algerian National Liberation Front and other militant groups whose members aimed to reclaim sovereignty for Algeria by force.

The ANS is composed of pathways that lead to and from ganglia, groups of nerve cells. A ganglion allows a large amount of divergence in a neuronal pathway and also enables a more localized circuitry for control of the innervated targets. The SCG is the only ganglion in the sympathetic nervous system that innervates the head and neck. It is the largest and most rostral (superior) of the three cervical ganglia. The SCG innervates many organs, glands and parts of the carotid system in the head. Structure Location The SCG is located opposite the second and third cervical vertebrae. It lies deep to the sheath of the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and anterior to the Longus capitis muscle. The SCG contains neurons that supply sympathetic innervation to a number of target organs within the head. The SCG also contributes to the cervical plexus. The cervical plexus is formed from a unification of the anterior divisions of the upper four cervical nerves. Each receives a gray ramus communicans from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.Henry Gray. Anatomy of the Human Body. 20th ed. Philadelphia: Lea & Febiger, 1918 New York: Bartleby.com, 2000. http://www.bartleby.com/107/210.html. Accessed July 9, 2013. Morphology and physiology and its neurons The superior cervical ganglion is a reddish-gray color, and usually shaped like a football with tapering ends. Sometimes the SCG is broad and flattened, and occasionally constricted at intervals. It formed by the coalescence of four ganglia, corresponding to the upper four cervical nerves, C1-C4. The bodies of these preganglionic sympathetic neurons are specifically located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord. These preganglionic neurons then enter the SCG and synapse with the postganglionic neurons that leave the rostral end of the SCG and innervate target organs of the head. There are a number of neuron types in the SCG ranging from low threshold to high threshold neurons. The neurons with a low threshold have faster action potential firing rate, while the high threshold neurons have a slow firing rate. Another distinction between SCG neuron types is made via immunostaining. Immunostaining allows the classification of SCG neurons as either positive or negative for neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is found in a subgroup of high-threshold neurons. Low threshold, NPY-negative neurons are secretomotor neurons, innervating salivary glands. High threshold, NPY-negative neurons are vasomotor neurons, innervating blood vessels. High threshold, NPY-positive neurons are vasoconstrictor neurons, which innervate the iris and pineal gland. Innervation The SCG receives input from the ciliospinal center. The ciliospinal center is located between the C8 and T1 regions of the spinal cord within the intermediolateral column. The preganglionic fibers that innervate the SCG are the thoracic spinal nerves, which extend from the T1-T8 region of the ciliospinal center. These nerves enter the SCG through the cervical sympathetic nerve. A mature preganglionic axon can innervate anywhere from 50-200 SCG cells. Postganglionic fibers then leave the SCG via the internal carotid nerve and the external carotid nerve. This pathway of SCG innervation is shown through stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve, which invokes action potentials in both the external and internal carotid nerves. These postganglionic fibers shift from multiple axon innervation of their targets to less profound multiple axon innervation or single axon innervation as the SCG neurons mature during postnatal development. Function Sympathetic nervous system The SCG provides sympathetic innervation to structures within the head, including the pineal gland, the blood vessels in the cranial muscles and the brain, the choroid plexus, the eyes, the lacrimal glands, the carotid body, the salivary glands, and the thyroid gland. Pineal gland The postganglionic axons of the SCG innervate the pineal gland and are involved in Circadian rhythm. This connection regulates production of the hormone melatonin, which regulates sleep and wake cycles, however the influence of SCG neuron innervation of the pineal gland is not fully understood. Carotid body The postganglionic axons of the SCG innervate the internal carotid artery and form the internal carotid plexus. The internal carotid plexus carries the postganglionic axons of the SCG to the eye, lacrimal gland, mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and pharynx, and numerous blood-vessels in the head. The eye The postganglionic axons of the Superior cervical ganglion innervate the eye and lacrimal gland and cause vasoconstriction of the iris and sclera, pupillary dilation, widening of the palpebral fissure, and the reduced production of tears. These responses are important during Fight-or-flight response of the ANS. Dilation of the pupils allows for an increased clarity in vision, and inhibition of the lacrimal gland stops tear production allowing for unimpaired vision and redirection of energy elsewhere. Blood vessels of the skin The postganglionic axons of the SCG innervate blood vessels in the skin and cause the vessels to constrict. Constriction of the blood vessels causes a decrease in blood flow to the skin leading to paling of the skin and retention of body heat. This plays into the fight-or-flight response, decreasing blood flow to facial skin and redirecting the blood to more important areas like the blood vessels of muscles. Vestibular system The SCG is connected with vestibular structures, including the neuroepithelium of the semicircular canals and otolith organs, providing a conceivable substrate for modulation of vestibulo-sympathetic reflexes. Clinical significance Horner's syndrome Horner's syndrome is a disorder resulting from damage to the sympathetic autonomic nervous pathway in the head. Damage to the SCG, part of this system, often results in Horner's syndrome. Damage to the T1-T3 regions of the spinal cord is responsible for drooping of the eyelids (ptosis), constriction of the pupil (miosis), and sinking of the eyeball (apparent Enophthalmos; not truly sunken, just appears so because of the drooping eyelid). Lesion or significant damage to the SCG results in a third order neuron disorder (see Horner's Syndrome: Pathophysiology). Familial dysautonomia Familial dysautonomia is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities of sensory and sympathetic neurons. The SCG is significantly affected by this loss of neurons and may be responsible for some of the resulting symptoms. In post-mortem studies the SCG is, on average, one-third of normal size and has only 12 percent of the normal number of neurons. Defects in the genetic coding for NGF, which result in less functional, abnormally structured NGF, may be the molecular cause of familial dysautonomia. NGF is necessary for survival of some neurons so loss of NGF function could be the cause for neuronal death in the SCG. History Reinnervation In the late 19th century, John Langley discovered that the superior cervical ganglion is topographically organized. When certain areas of the superior cervical ganglion were stimulated, a reflex occurred in specified regions of the head. His findings showed that preganglionic neurons innervate specific postganglionic neurons. In his further studies of the superior cervical ganglion, Langley discovered that the superior cervical ganglion is regenerative. Langley severed the SCG above the T1 portion, causing a loss of reflexes. When left to their own accord, the fibers reinnervated the SCG and the initial autonomic reflexes were recovered, though there was limited recovery of pineal gland function. When Langley severed the connections between the SCG and the T1‚ÄìT5 region of the spinal cord and replaced the SCG with a different one, the SCG was still innervated the same portion of the spinal cord as before. When he replaced the SCG with a T5 ganglion, the ganglion tended to be innervated by the posterior portion of the spinal cord (T4‚ÄìT8). The replacement of the original SCG with either a different one or a T5 ganglion supported Langley's theory of topographic specificity of the SCG. Research Ganglia of the peripheral autonomic nervous system are commonly used to study synaptic connections. These ganglia are studied as synaptic connections show many similarities to the central nervous system (CNS) and are also relatively accessible. They are easier to study than the CNS since they have the ability to regrow, which neurons in the CNS do not have. The SCG is frequently used in these studies being one of the larger ganglia. Today, neuroscientists are studying topics on the SCG such as survival and neurite outgrowth of SCG neurons, neuroendocrine aspects of the SCG, and structure and pathways of the SCG. These studies are usually performed on rats, guinea-pigs, and rabbits. Historical contributions * E. Rubin studied the development of the SCG in fetal rats. Research on the development of nerves in the SCG has implications for the general development of the nervous system. *The effects of age on dendritic arborisation of sympathetic neurons has been studied in the SCG of rats. Findings have shown that there is significant dendritic growth in the SCG of young rats but none in aged rats. In aged rats, it was found, that there was a reduction in the number of dendrites. * SCG cells were used to study nerve growth factor (NGF) and its ability to direct growth of neurons. Results showed that NGF did have this directing, or tropic, effect on neurons, guiding the direction of their growth.

Spatial dependence is measured as the existence of statistical dependence in a collection of random variables, each of which is associated with a different geographical location. Spatial dependence is of importance in applications where it is reasonable to postulate the existence of corresponding set of random variables at locations that have not been included in a sample. Thus rainfall may be measured at a set of rain gauge locations, and such measurements can be considered as outcomes of random variables, but rainfall clearly occurs at other locations and would again be random. Because rainfall exhibits properties of autocorrelation, spatial interpolation techniques can be used to estimate rainfall amounts at locations near measured locations. As with other types of statistical dependence, the presence of spatial dependence generally leads to estimates of an average value from a sample being less accurate than had the samples been independent, although if negative dependence exists a sample average can be better than in the independent case. A different problem than that of estimating an overall average is that of spatial interpolation: here the problem is to estimate the unobserved random outcomes of variables at locations intermediate to places where measurements are made, on that there is spatial dependence between the observed and unobserved random variables. Tools for exploring spatial dependence include: spatial correlation, spatial covariance functions and semivariograms. Methods for spatial interpolation include Kriging, which is a type of best linear unbiased prediction. The topic of spatial dependence is of importance to geostatistics and spatial analysis.

Over the years Acoustic Caf√© has presented artists including John Prine, John Mayer, M Ward, Emmylou Harris, Beck, Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (whose \\"Million Dollar Intro\\" is the music played at the program's opening and closing). New, up-and- coming talent remains a constant of Acoustic Cafe's mission. Acoustic Caf√© can be heard on commercial and non-commercial radio stations around North America, and worldwide on Voice Of America. Web broadcasts and a streaming archive are also widely available on the net. By 2010, Acoustic Caf√© had grown to 90+ terrestrial radio affiliates and expanded its online presence and archive (link below). Acoustic Caf√© began taping sessions on the road in 2012, with sessions held at both the national Folk Alliance convention (2/12, Memphis, TN) and Midwest Regional convention (10/12, St. Louis). In 2013, Acoustic Caf√© and SongCraft Presents in New York joined forces to create new songs at SXSW in Austin, TX. Songwriters were invited to a secret location in Austin to work with SongCraft Presents' Ben Arthur to create a brand new song in a 3-hour session. The demos were then taken back to New York for the creation of the finished song. Acoustic Caf√© aired interviews with the artists, as well as extended segments about the creation of the new songs. At the end of 2013, SXSW announced that the Acoustic Caf√©/SongCraft Presents sessions would be an official part of the 2014 SXSW. 2013 also saw Acoustic Caf√© recording a special session with Billy Bragg on stage at Americanafest in Nashville, TN (9/13), and the launch of a new performance space called The Leon Loft, in partnership with Leon Speakers of Ann Arbor, MI. Leon Loft sessions from Fitz & The Tantrums, Mike Doughty, Lord Huron and more have been airing on the program in 2014. Acoustic Caf√© entered its 20th year of syndication in January, 2014. Also in 2014, Acoustic Cafe and SongCraft Presents returned to SXSW, where they partnered with Subway Restaurants to create The Subway Sessions. As in 2103, songwriters created new songs in a 3-hour session, documented in both video and audio. Additionally, Acoustic Cafe and SongCraft presented a panel at the conference to discuss the creative process and debut some of the new songs created in Austin between 3/10 and 3/15, 2014. SXSW coincided with Acoustic Cafe's 1000th continuous weekly broadcast. 2014 was the inaugural year of the Acoustic Cafe curated new-folk series at St. Cecilia Music Center, Grand Rapids, MI. Rhiannon Giddens and Justin Townes Earle were part of the series in St. Cecilia's 2014-15 season. The partnership was renewed for the 2015-16 season, including shows with The Steel Wheels, Shawn Colvin, Alejandro Escovedo and Leo Kottke. 2016-17's season included Margo Price, Marc Cohn, Langhorne Slim and Pokey LaFarge. In 2015, Acoustic Cafe and SongCraft Presents partnered with Ford Motor Company for their \\"Songs Of The Road\\" series. Similar to the previous work with songwriters at SXSW, \\"Songs Of The Road\\" took artists on short road trips where they worked with Ben Arthur (SongCraft Presents) to create a brand new song. The songs were then recorded at a studio, and premiered in front of a live audience, using the car (2015 Ford CMAX Energi) for amplification. 5 new songs were created, and the videos and audio were turned into a web series to accompany the radio features on Acoustic Cafe.

It is a Grade II listed building. History Old Holborn Town Hall on Gray's Inn Road The first town hall was a substantial structure on the corner of Gray's Inn Road and Clerkenwell Road which had been designed by Lewis Isaacs in an Italianate style, built by Brown & Robinson of Finsbury and completed in 1879. Following the creation of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn in 1900, consideration was given to expanding this building but this proposal was rejected on the grounds that the old building would be difficult to adapt. After being used as a concert hall during the first half of the 20th century, it was demolished in the 1960s. Instead it was decided to extend an existing building on High Holborn which had been designed by William Rushworth in the French Renaissance style and which had opened as a public library in 1894. The design for the existing (eastern) wing had involved a narrow main frontage with four bays facing onto High Holborn; there were two arched entrances both flanked by Corinthian order pilasters on the ground floor; there were oriel windows on the first and second floors and smaller windows on the third and fourth floors with an oculus above. The foundation stone for the extension to this building to create a new town hall was laid by the mayor, William Smith, on 27 October 1906. The design involved creating a new central wing and a new western wing, in a similar and symmetrical style to the existing eastern wing, based on the plans of Septimus Warwick and H. Austen Hall. The works were carried out by John Greenwood Limited and the new town hall was officially opened by the Lord Mayor, Sir George Truscott, on 13 October 1908.Illustrated London News, 17 October 1908, \\"London's New Public Building: Holborn Town Hall; Opened by the Lord Mayor last Tuesday\\" A wrought-iron balcony bearing a borough coat of arms made by the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts was installed in the middle of the central section on the first floor. The principal rooms were a court room on the ground floor a council chamber at the rear of the building on the first floor. The First International Syndicalist Congress, a meeting of European and Latin American syndicalist organizations, was held at the town hall from 27 September to 2 October 1913. A plaque, manufactured by De La Rue, commemorating the efforts of council employees in contributing to the Wings for Victory Week, as part of a wider War Savings Campaign, was erected on the wall just inside the right hand doorway in 1943. Another plaque, commemorating their contribution to Salute the Soldier Week, was erected there the following year. The building on High Holborn ceased to function as the local of seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Camden was formed in 1965 and was subsequently converted for alternative uses including restaurant use (on the ground floor) and offices (above). The freehold ownership of the building was acquired by a private investor for ¬£22 million in September 2019.

In NJPW, he is a former one-time IWGP Tag Team Champion and a two-time World Tag League winner with Togi Makabe. Professional wrestling career Big Japan Pro Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling (1997‚Äì2007) During his second year of high school, Honma initially had aspirations of joining the New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) dojo and took part in a tryout, but was unsuccessful and sought training elsewhere.„Äé„Ç¥„É≥„Ç∞„ÄèÊñ∞Ë£ÖÂàä2Âè∑ pp86 -91Êé≤Ëºâ„ÅÆ„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éì„É•„Éº He eventually trained with Michinoku Pro Wrestling for 1 year,„Äé„Ç¥„É≥„Ç∞„ÄèÊñ∞Ë£ÖÂàä2Âè∑ pp86 -91Êé≤Ëºâ„ÅÆ„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éì„É•„Éº but did not debut in Michinoku Pro and instead spent his early career in Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW), debuting for the promotion in May 1997. After spending time wrestling in opening matches for the promotion, Honma began to compete in BJW's deathmatch division. While a part of BJW, he became the first wrestler to use a lightube in a match, an item that has since become synonymous with deathmatch wrestling worldwide. In October 2000, Honma left BJW after disagreements with company management. After touring with various independent promotions such as IWA Japan, Onita Pro, and Rainbow Pro, Honma debuted in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) on November 24, 2001, against Nobukazu Hirai. Honma was invited by owner Motoko Baba to join the promotion, and signed a full-time contract with the company in March 2002. In February 2003, he formed Turmeric Storm with Kazushi Miyamoto, but the team later disbanded on April 20, 2004, after losing a trial series. In 2005, Honma became affiliated with Kensuke Sasaki's Kensuke Office agency in an effort to further improve his career. A severe neck injury kept him out of action throughout much of early 2006, but he returned in March of that same year. Honma announced his departure from AJPW on April 28, 2006, and became a freelancer. Throughout 2006, he worked for Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max and King's Road, where he reformed Turmeric Storm with Kazushi Miyamoto. On September 24, 2006, Tomoaki Honma and Jun Kasai won Apache Pro-Wrestling Army's WEW World Tag Team Championship from Takashi Sasaki and Badboy Hido. The team vacated the championship on February 20, 2007. New Japan Pro-Wrestling GBH and departure (2006‚Äì2013) Throughout 2006, Honma appeared in New Japan Pro-Wrestling's (NJPW) Wrestle Land sub-brand as \\"Makai Masked Canadian\\", a masked member of the Makai Club faction. Honma participated in the 2007 New Japan Cup tournament, falling to veteran Takashi Iizuka in his first round match. Prior to the match, Honma expressed interest in joining Hiroyoshi Tenzan's GBH faction, and was allowed to join after making a positive impression on Tenzan; however, Tenzan became disenchanted with Honma's difficulty in gaining victories, so he forced Honma to pass through a trial series to prove that he belongs in GBH. After ending his trial series with a losing record, Honma was initially kicked out of GBH but was allowed to remain in the group, after Togi Makabe took over the group's leadership. In April 2009, Honma showed his loyalty to Makabe by remaining in GBH after the other members of the group left to form the Chaos faction with Shinsuke Nakamura. On December 23, 2011, Honma received a rare championship opportunity, when he challenged for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship in the main event of a NJPW show at Korakuen Hall, losing to champion Masato Tanaka at the end of a 23 minute bout. On March 28, 2012, New Japan announced that the promotion had released Honma from his contract due to a \\"personal problem\\". Following his release from NJPW, Honma returned to AJPW on September 8, 2012, where he remained for the rest of the year and much of early 2013. In March 2013, Honma began appearing in Pro Wrestling Noah, where he took part in the 2013 Global Tag League with Akitoshi Saito. The duo finished the tournament with one win and two points.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=95054 Return and Honmania (2013‚Äì2017) On March 23, 2013, Honma returned to NJPW, saving Togi Makabe from Chaos. It was later revealed that Honma would be working for NJPW full- time as a freelancer. The reunited GBH had their first match back together on April 7 at Invasion Attack, where they were defeated by Masato Tanaka and Yujiro Takahashi in a tag team match. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2013, Honma unsuccessfully challenged Tanaka for the NEVER Openweight Championship. Honma received another shot at the title a year later at Wrestling Dontaku 2014, but was again defeated by the defending champion, Tomohiro Ishii. From July 21 to August 8, 2014, Honma took part in his first G1 Climax as a late replacement for an injured Kota Ibushi, losing all ten of his matches and finishing last in his block. Honma's struggle in the tournament made him one of the most popular wrestlers in all of NJPW, creating a movement called \\"Honmania\\". In November, Honma took part in the 2014 World Tag League, alongside Togi Makabe. The two finished last in their block with a record of three wins and four losses. The series of losses built to a big win on January 4, 2015, at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, where Honma, Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima defeated Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale, Jeff Jarrett and Yujiro Takahashi, with Honma pinning Takahashi for the win. On February 14 at The New Beginning in Sendai, Honma replaced an ill Togi Makabe in a match for the now vacant NEVER Openweight Championship, but was defeated by Tomohiro Ishii. During July and August, Honma took part in the 2015 G1 Climax. After losing his first seven matches in the tournament, Honma finally picked up his first ever win in the tournament over Tomohiro Ishii on August 12. After losing his final match against Yujiro Takahashi, Honma again finished last in his block with a record of one win and eight losses. Honma's win over Ishii led to him unsuccessfully challenging Ishii for the NEVER Openweight Championship on November 7 at Power Struggle. In December, Honma and Makabe won their block in the 2015 World Tag League with a record of four wins and two losses, advancing to the finals of the tournament. Honma in March 2015 On December 9, Honma and Makabe defeated Los Ingobernables de Japon (Evil and Tetsuya Naito) in the finals to win the 2015 World Tag League. On January 4, 2016, at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome, Honma won his first title in NJPW, when he and Makabe defeated Bullet Club's Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. They made their first successful title defense on February 14 at The New Beginning in Niigata in a rematch against Gallows and Anderson. The following week, Honma took part in the NJPW and Ring of Honor (ROH) co- produced Honor Rising: Japan 2016 event, unsuccessfully challenging Jay Lethal for the ROH World Championship in the main event of the second show on February 20. Honma and Makabe lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship to Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa) on April 10 at Invasion Attack 2016. On July 3, Honma unsuccessfully challenged Katsuyori Shibata for the NEVER Openweight Championship. From July 22 to August 13, Honma took part in the 2016 G1 Climax, where he finished with a record of three wins and six losses. In November, Honma participated on the Revolution Pro Wrestling (RPW) and NJPW co-produced Global Wars UK event, where he defeated Sha Samuels on the first night, but lost to Josh Bodom on the second night. In December, Honma and Makabe advanced to the finals of the 2016 World Tag League by winning their block with a record of five wins and two losses. On December 10, Honma and Makabe defeated the reigning IWGP Tag Team Champions Guerrillas of Destiny to win the 2016 World Tag League, becoming the first ever team to win the tournament in two consecutive years. On January 4, 2017, at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome, Honma and Makabe took part in a three-way match for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, which was won by Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano. On March 3, Honma was injured during a match, while taking a rope-hung DDT from Jado. Following the move, Honma could not get up and the match was immediately stopped, before he was taken backstage on a stretcher. Reportedly, Honma was able to speak and move his head, but not his arms or legs. The following day, NJPW announced that Honma had injured his cervical vertebrae. On March 6 it was announced that Honma had regained movement in his lower extremities and could grasp objects with his hands. Honma vowed to recover from the injury and return to the ring. On March 31, Honma announced he had successfully undergone surgery on his spinal canal. The following month, Honma stated he was looking to return to the ring in the fall of 2017. He was discharged in June after spending three and a half months in the hospital. Return from injury (2018‚Äìpresent) On June 3, 2018, it was announced that Honma would make his return to the ring later that month. Honma returned on June 23, teaming with Hiroshi Tanahashi, Togi Makabe, Ryusuke Taguchi and Toa Henare to defeat Los Ingobernables De Japon (Tetsuya Naito, Evil, Hiromu Takahashi, Sanada and Bushi).https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=200933 On March 19, 2019, he appeared in the first match of New Japan Cup 2019 in a team consisting of Yota Tsuji, Ren Narita and Shota Umino. Personal life Honma's characteristically hoarse voice is the result of crushed vocal chords, a problem also suffered by fellow wrestlers Shachihoko Boy, Kohei Sato and Genichiro Tenryu. In November 2015, Honma's former girlfriend of 18 years, fellow professional wrestler Kiyoko Ichiki, accused him of domestic violence over the past four years. Honma denied the accusation, instead claiming that he was abused by her and stating that he was seeking legal action against her for trying to damage his career. Since August 2017, Honma has been married to a woman named Chie.

It was renamed to its current name when sold by the Shriners and was renovated into one and two bedroom efficiency apartments. Description A Historic Landmark, the Faust is 15 stories tall (186 ft., 57 m) and is capped by a flagpole over the penthouse with a large U.S. flag that flies 24 hours a day. The \\"Faust\\" is still Rockford's tallest building. Before 1980 the hotel was also adorned with a set of large red neon letters in a double row that proclaimed Faust Hotel and later, Tebala Towers on the north top side and the east top side of the building. In the early 1980s a fierce windstorm knocked down some of the letters, damaging the building and putting pedestrians & residents at risk. All of these letters were taken down shortly after this incident. Plans to place a large replica of a 'Fez' Cap over the penthouse, at the base of the flagpole, was abandoned as impractical. History At the end of World War II, during VJ day, the center for much of the celebration in Rockford took place in the area of the Faust hotel and the nearby Midway theater. In its heyday, the Faust was known as the premier hotel for Rockford, hosting such dignitaries as President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the 1960 Democratic Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, as well as one of the Kings of Sweden during a visit to the Swedish community located in Rockford. Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland, third son of Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, was the guest of honor at a banquet held at the Faust Hotel in 1938. His younger brother Prince Carl Johan Bernadotte Count Wisborg often stayed at the hotel during business trips in his involvement with the Sundstrand Corporation, but was embarrassed by a Bernadotte Suite decorated for him with royal crowns and the Swedish colors of blue and yellow.Carl Johan Bernadotte in Det var en g√•ng ...

Spotton received a bachelor's degree in history from Queen's University, graduating in 1895. During World War I he briefly served in the Canadian Army (now the Canadian Forces) as a broadcast journalist. He was born to Margaret Hickson and James Spotton in the township of Howick, Ontario. He died of lung cancer at the age of 59.  Political career  Spotton was elected as a member of parliament for the Huron North, Ontario region, where he ran as a Conservative. He advocated less autonomy for provinces and the implementation of a Canadian cultural program. This program was scrapped at the time, but revived almost a century later by the Liberals. George Spotton is rarely recognized as a pioneer of Canadian cultural issues, mainly because of his unpopular stance on relations with the United States, in which he pushed for stronger ties with their Southern neighbour. In his political views he was also a staunch monarchist, well known for his belief that the only true Canadian men were those with British backgrounds. He also argued fervently against the contemporaneous influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe on the basis that they showed little interest in Canada and Canadian politics. Election campaign In his 1927 election campaign George Spotton held the motto \\"We Will Win\\" and though he won, garnering 1,915 votes, it was hardly an endorsement of leadership of any level. He polled about 1,891 votes only half of the eligible voters in Horwick county. George Spotton was then accused of corrupt election practise when several voters said they were shaken down by police for money, this was later discovered to be an attempt to mudsling at George Spotton. He was not the only member facing trouble. His brother in-law was charged with criminal corruption, but cleared for the same reasons. This election campaign turned into a political drama of sorts reminiscent of the novel All the King's Men.

A protologism is coined to fill a gap in the language, with the hope of its becoming an accepted word. When it was created, the term protologism was autological; it was an example of the thing it describes. Epstein coined the term by combining the Greek words ' and ': According to Epstein, every word in use started out as a protologism, subsequently became a neologism, and then gradually grew to be part of the language.

Structure At first, it passes downward and laterally across the scalenus anterior and phrenic nerve, being covered by the sternocleidomastoid muscle; it then crosses the subclavian artery and the brachial plexus, running behind and parallel with the clavicle and subclavius muscle and beneath the inferior belly of the omohyoid to the superior border of the scapula. It passes over the superior transverse scapular ligament in most of the cases while below it through the suprascapular notch in some cases.Chapter 8: THE SHOULDER AND AXILLAScapular Region The artery then enters the supraspinous fossa of the scapula. It travels close to the bone, running through the suprascapular canal underneath the supraspinatus muscle, to which it supplies branches. It then descends behind the neck of the scapula, through the great scapular notch and under cover of the inferior transverse ligament, to reach the infraspinatous fossa, where it supplies infraspinatus and anastomoses with the scapular circumflex artery and the descending branch (aka dorsal scapular artery) of the transverse cervical artery. Function Besides distributing branches to the sternocleidomastoid (which, however, mainly is supplied by the occipital artery and the superior thyroid artery), subclavius (which mainly is supplied by the thoracoacromial artery), and neighboring muscles, it gives off a suprasternal branch, which crosses over the sternal end of the clavicle to the skin of the upper part of the chest; and an acromial branch, which pierces the trapezius and supplies the skin over the acromion, anastomosing with the thoracoacromial artery. Just as with supplying the subclavius muscle, it anastomoses with the thoracoacromial artery in supplying skin areas. As the artery passes over the superior transverse scapular ligament, it sends a branch into the subscapular fossa, where it ramifies beneath the subscapularis, and anastomoses with the subscapular artery and with the dorsal scapular artery. It also sends articular branches to the acromioclavicular joint and the shoulder joint, and a nutrient artery to the clavicle.

In 2014, he was honored with the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasting excellence by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Biography Nadel grew up in Brooklyn, New York, as a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers and decided at a young age that he wanted to be a sports broadcaster. He developed his skills at Brown University (class of 1972), announcing hockey and football games on radio station WBRU. He had minor league hockey play-by-play stints in Muskegon, Oklahoma City, and Dallas, and was also the radio voice of the Dallas Diamonds of the Women's Professional Basketball League. The Rangers hired Nadel in 1979, and he called games on television and radio in his first three seasons. Beginning in 1982, he began a 13-year run with Mark Holtz as the radio team on WBAP, returning to the television booth for one year in 1984. Nadel became the team's lead radio voice when Holtz moved to television in 1995. Since becoming the primary play- by-play voice for the Rangers, Nadel has worked alongside Brad Sham, Vince Cotroneo, and Victor Rojas. In May 2006, Nadel announced that he had signed a \\"lifetime contract\\" with the Rangers, allowing him to continue on their broadcast team until he chooses to retire.

Beginning in 2009, he was partnered with longtime ESPN and former Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs announcer Dave Barnett, who also did Rangers games on television with Brad Sham in the late 80s and early 90s. After Barnett moved to television, former MLB pitcher Steve Busby was Nadel's partner. Since July 2012 after Busby replaced Barnett on television, Nadel has been joined by Matt Hicks in the radio booth. Rangers games are now primarily on 105.3 The Fan, which has been the Rangers' flagship station since the 2015 season. At the conclusion of the 2018 season, Nadel joined a handful of broadcasters to call Major League Baseball games for 40 years, with the added distinction of calling all of them for one franchise. Among Nadel's most memorable calls was the 5000th strikeout of Nolan Ryan's career on August 22, 1989. His main home run call is \\"That ball is history!\\" The arrival of Rub√©n Sierra in Texas motivated Nadel to learn Spanish. Nadel is now a fluent Spanish speaker, having taken part in Spanish-language game broadcasts in a number of Latin American countries. Awards In 1991, Nadel was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame. He has received the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Texas Sportscaster of the Year Award seven times (1999, 2001, 2002, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011) and won the Associated Press award for Best Play-by-Play in Texas three times. On August 11, 2012, Nadel became the 15th member inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. On December 11, 2013, Nadel was selected as the 2014 recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award, presented annually for excellence in broadcasting by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Nadel received the award at a ceremony at Doubleday Field on Saturday, July 26, 2014, as part of the Hall of Fame 2014 weekend festivities. In recognition of his achievements, Nadel's high school alma mater, Midwood High School at Brooklyn College, has created the Eric Nadel Memorial Award for Athletic Improvement and Character. It will be awarded annually to a deserving student athlete.  Personal life  Nadel appeared as the Rangers' radio announcer in the film The Rookie in 2002. Nadel is active in animal causes and was one of the founders of the first leash-free dog park in the DFW Metroplex at White Rock Lake in Dallas. He stages benefit concerts for non-profit organizations, including Focus on Teens and Cafe Momentum, and is an active advocate for mental health organizations such as NAMI and The Campaign to Change Direction. Nadel is also the author of several books (see Bibliography). In 2018, inspired after reading a rhymed radio ad, he began writing baseball-inspired limericks. His limericks have been published in a book titled Lim-Eric!.  Bibliography  *Nadel, Eric. The Night Wilt Scored 100: Tales from Basketball's Past. New York: Taylor Publishing, 1990.

History Philadelphia based filmmaker Don Argott noticed colorful posters advertising concerts by the Paul Green School of Rock Music around the Philadelphia area, and contacted Green. He and his producing partner Sheena M. Joyce attended a concert featuring the music of Frank Zappa. Shortly after the concert began, Argott heard C.J. Tywoniak playing a guitar part that he \\"didn't think could be played\\" and decided he had to make a documentary. They began shooting their documentary in January 2003, using money that DreamWorks had paid Argott for his musical contributions to the Will Ferrell comedy Old School. In the \\"fourth or fifth month\\" of the nine month shooting schedule, Argott and Joyce first heard of the Paramount film with Jack Black, a narrative film featuring a lead character who bore a strong resemblance to Green. One third of the $600,000 budget for the film was spent on music rights. Synopsis The film opens with the a title card and the sound of Carlos Santana's guitar solo from the song \\"Black Magic Woman\\". Paul Green, the primary subject of the film introduces the evening's concert. The camera pans to reveals that the guitarist is twelve-year-old C.J. Tywoniak. The School is then introduced, with Green re-enacting a scene from the film The Silence of the Lambs as Jame Gumb for a group of students. This is followed by the first of a number of interview segments with Green throughout the film. He explains why he started a performance-based program. 9 year old twin boys Asa and Tucker Collins are interviewed, followed by an interview with Tywoniak and his parents about his future in music, teenage girl Madi Diaz-Svalgard, a Quaker singer/songwriter who frequently clashes with Green and finally Will O'Conner a less-successful student who credits the School with saving his life. These students are followed closely through the rest of the film. Green talks about various students and then introduces the All-Star program, which is concentrating on the music of Frank Zappa, and including concert footage of the students playing a Zappa song. He then leads the camera on a tour of the School, dropping in on various classroom lessons including Asa trying to learn Black Sabbath's \\"The Wizard\\". The film moves to the Collins' home and introduces the twins' mother Andrea Collins, followed by O'Conner at home with his mother Lisa. There is a montage of scenes of the students rehearsing for a beginner's Black Sabbath show, and an 80's show by the intermediate students, and interviews with other students including Eric and Julie Slick, and keyboard teacher Eric Svalgard, father of Madi Diaz. Green confesses that, if the school is successful, the students will become better musicians than himself, followed by his personal history and introduces his wife Lisa. A clip of Zappa musician Napoleon Murphy Brock is played for the students, and Green talks about getting the students to play Zappa's notoriously difficult music. The All-Stars have been invited to play the annual Zappa music festival Zappanale. Green and various students are interviewed about the upcoming event. Diaz is interviewed about a side project with her Quaker friends, the Friendly Gangstaz who rap traditional Quaker hymns, which Green mocks. Tywoniak's parents discuss their son's focus and drive. Andrea applies make-up to her son Tucker and dresses Asa's hair into the Mohawk hairstyle seen on the film poster in preparation for the twins' Black Sabbath show while singing the song \\"Sweet Leaf\\". Several Black Sabbath songs are performed at the concert including \\"Sweet Leaf\\", \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Iron Man\\". Green delivers a ranting, profanity-laden halftime speech during the intermission of the show. On the commentary track, the directors reveal that the MPAA informed them that the film was rated R, and had 38 usages of the word \\"fuck\\". The location switches to Green's home and a scene with his infant son Walden, who dances enthusiastically to a Zappa song. A title card reveals that Tywoniak had to undergo emergency orthopedic surgery two days before a concert. Green introduces him at the concert, revealing that Tywoniak would not undergo the operation unless he could play the concert. Back at the school, Green tells the students that Melissa Dribben, a reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper, is to do a feature story on the school. The article is critical of Green and his methods and O'Conner says that it \\"was written with the composition of a fourth grader\\". Dribben had called O'Conner \\"the sad Eeyore of Rock School\\", and revealed a Green joke about the \\"Will O'Conner Award for the Student Most Likely To Kill Himself\\". This caused considerable friction at O'Conner's home, resulting in him leaving the school. There is another montage of rehearsals for the 80s tribute show which was not going well, a situation exacerbated by a broken air conditioner on a very hot day. Diaz and Green are interviewed about their relationship, Green stating that he believes she is \\"an extraordinary talent\\". Green is interviewed in his car in a calmer, more reflective mood, revealing that he created Rock School so that he \\"had something that he could be the best at\\". Tywoniak is shown at the Guitar Gods show playing Eddie Van Halen's cover of the Kinks song \\"You Really Got Me\\", followed by more interview footage of Green in the backyard of his home and O'Conner after he had left the school. Another montage of the fraught 80s show rehearsals with Green ranting and slamming doors, screaming \\"Don't fucking make mistakes! Not on 'Rebel Yell'!\\" Green is interviewed about his relationship with the students, and motivation. O'Conner is interviewed at an art space screen-printing T-shirts, reflecting on his time at the school. The All-Stars are shown rehearsing Zappa songs for their trip to Germany and the Zappanale festival, aboard the flight, arriving at the Berlin airport and traveling to Bad Doberan. Green gives a long pep talk about the upcoming concert at the youth hostel at which the kids are staying, followed by a trip to the festival. The next day, Green wakes the kids, followed by interviews with each of the All-Stars about the upcoming show, performing technically difficult music before an audience very familiar with that music. The All- Stars rehearse \\"Inca Roads\\" with Napoleon Murphy Brock, who is interviewed about his experience, recalling being incredulous when first informed of the school and the material the students were playing. Green gives a last-minute set of performance notes before they take the stage. They perform Zappa's \\"Zomby Woof\\", followed by an original solo by Tywoniak, intercut with shots of audience members with incredulous looks on their faces. Brock then takes the stage, dropping to his knees, genuflecting to Tywoniak before going to the front of the stage and leading the audience in a mass genuflection before leading the band on \\"Inca Roads\\". As the All-Stars leave the stage, they are greeted by a collection of other festival performers including Jimmy Carl Black of the Mothers of Invention who thanks Green for his work and describes the All-Stars as \\"phenomenal\\". The All-Stars are jamming with other festival performers in final concert scene, and Green hugs his performers. The end of the film features interviews with O'Conner, Tywoniak, Diaz, Green and the Tucker twins trying to sum up their Rock School experience. The credit sequence features the students playing \\"School's Out\\" with Alice Cooper at the film's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, intercut with additional scenes of Green and the students of the school. Reception The film had a successful run on the festival circuit, screenings often followed by concerts by the students of the school. A showing at Seattle's Egyptian theater was followed by a concert featuring Ann Wilson and Eddie Vedder, and a sold-out screening at the Experience Music Project. It did not do as well in regular theatrical distribution, possibly due to consumer confusion with the similarly named Jack Black film. It was withdrawn from distribution after a single weekend. Manohla Dargis, writing for The New York Times, notes that \\"Mr. Green's pedagogic style appears predicated on the idea that if you spare the insults, derision and eardrum-piercing assaults, you spoil the child\\" while Roger Ebert points out that \\"What is important is that he doesn't talk down to the students, and he is deadly serious about wanting them to work hard, practice more, and become good musicians. He rants and raves, but at least he doesn't condescend.\\" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post called the film \\"fascinating and funny\\" and an \\"entertaining portrait of a volatile but effective educator\\". Philadelphia Weekly called it an \\"utterly charming crowd pleaser\\", described the direction as \\"inspired\\" and said the film \\"makes Jack Black's turn in School of Rock look as punk as Mr. Belvedere\\". NPR rock critic Ken Tucker said, \\"I'd hand out DVDs of Rock School to everyone in the country with a teaching degree, and dare them to match this level of commitment.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack for the film was released May 31, 2005 featuring the students of the School performing with Gregg Rolie of Santana, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple's Ian Gillan, Yes' Jon Anderson, The Police's Stewart Copeland, The Ramones' Marky Ramone, Heart's Ann Wilson, Megadeth's Dave Mustaine, and Billy Idol. # \\"Black Magic Woman\\" ‚Äì Gregg Rolie # \\"I Wanna Be Sedated\\" ‚Äì Marky Ramone, Tyson Ritter of the All-American Rejects # \\"School's Out\\" ‚Äì Alice Cooper # \\"Barracuda\\" ‚Äì Ann Wilson # \\"Highway Star\\" ‚Äì Ian Gillan # \\"L.A.

Biography  Lawrence was born in Bayside, Queens, New York, in 1820. He was a descendant of John Lawrence and John Bowne, both Quakers and pioneer English settlers of Queens, NY. Lawrence moved to Louisiana in 1843 and engaged in the planting and refining of sugar. He served in the Louisiana State House of Representatives for some time and then successfully contested the re-election of Jacob Hale Sypher. Lawrence then served for one day in Congress but was not reelected. He died at Magnolia Plantation, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana in 1878.  Contested election  The voting in the 1872 election was characterized by a number of irregularities, with Sypher initially being declared the winner and returned to Congress while Lawrence appealed the election results. Lawrence's belated replacement of Sypher, after courts intervened to nullify the original results and instead deliver the seat to Lawrence, marked the first time since the Civil War that a Democrat had defeated a Republican for a seat in Congress from Louisiana. The 1874 voting in which Lawrence failed \\"re-election\\" to the seat had already been held before he was seated for the term to which he had, by the later court-order, been elected in 1872. Thus, under the congressional calendar in effect at the time, Lawrence was able to serve for one day of the 1873‚Äì1875 term to which he had, in the end, been elected. On the following day‚ÄîMarch 4, 1875‚Äîhe was succeeded by Randall Lee Gibson, a Democrat who had defeated him during the preceding autumn.

The station served the communities of Attercliffe, Burngreave and workers in the Don Valley and was situated on the Midland Main Line near Attercliffe Road, lying between Sheffield railway station and Brightside railway station. History The station was opened at the same time as the main line from Chesterfield was opened in 1870 and had two platforms. This new station of 1870 was designed by the company architect John Holloway Sanders. The station was positioned above Effingham Street, although access was from a gated path from Leveson Street; an underpass led to an inclined bridge on to the Down platforms. A 1912 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Attercliffe Road (centre) Opened by the Midland Railway, it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways upon nationalisation in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways in co-operation with the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive until the privatisation of British Rail. The decline of Sheffield's steel industry in the later half of the 20th century gradually reduced the passenger usage and made the station less and less needed. By the 1980s only certain morning and evening peak trains called at the station, as stopping trains there exacerbated capacity problems in the major bottleneck north of Sheffield Midland. By the early 1990s this lack of trains had caused the station's patronage to dwindle to a level at which closure was easily justified, again with line capacity constraints being quoted as the reason, with the end coming in 1995. Little is left of the station but the platforms which can be seen from moving trains. The underpass is blocked by overgrown vegetation although the gated entrance can still be seen from Leveson Street just by the bridge over the River Don.

It later became prevalent in modified form in Tibetan Buddhism and related traditions. The distinction is, on the one hand, a historic or quasi-historic scheme by which the Buddha's first sermons, as recorded in the Pali Canon and the tripitakas of other early schools, constitute the First Turning, and the later Mahayana sutras comprise the Second and Third turnings. The schema appears in the Samdhinirmochana Sutra, a central Yogachara text, although it may predate it. The model of three turnings of the 'Wheel' is an attempt to categorize the content, philosophical view, and practical application of the whole array of Buddhist sutrayana teachings. In East Asian Buddhism, this classification system was expanded and modified into different doctrinal classifications called panjiao which were developed by different Chinese Buddhist schools.Ronald S. Green, Chanju Mun, Gy≈çnen‚Äôs Transmission of the Buddha Dharma in Three Countries, BRILL, 2018, p. 28. Contents of the Three Turnings The basic content and audience of the three turnings of the wheel can be summarized as follows: First Turning The first turning is traditionally said to have taken place at Deer Park in Sarnath near Varanasi in northern India, to an audience of shravakas. It consisted of the teaching of the Four Noble Truths (Sanskrit: catvƒÅry ƒÅryasatyƒÅniJones, Lindsay (Ed. in Chief)(2005). Encyclopedia of Religion. (2nd Ed.) Volume 14; Masaaki, Hattori (Ed.)(1987 & 2005)\\"YogƒÅcƒÅra\\": p.9897. USA: Macmillan Reference. (v.14)) and the other elements of the Tripitaka - the Abhidharma, Sutrapitaka and Vinaya. The Abhidharma referred to is the Abhidharma Pitaka of the Sarvastivada school, which is a later composition not taught by the Buddha, and contains philosophy which is antithetical, one may say, to the early teachings.David Kalupahana, \\"Sarvastivada and its theory of sarvam asti.\\" University of Ceylon Review 24 1966, 94-105. Second Turning The second turning is said to have taken place at Vulture Peak Mountain in Rajagriha, in Bihar, India. The audience comprised bodhisattvas; in some telling there were also shravaka arhats there as well. In the second turning, the emphasis is on emptiness (Skt: ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ) as epitomized in the Prajnaparamita sutras, and on compassion (Skt: '). These two elements form bodhicitta, the epitome of the second turning. The Madhyamika school that Nagarjuna founded arose from his exegesis of the early texts and is included under the second turning. Nagarjuna attacked the metaphysics of the Sarvastivada school and a school which broke away from it called Sautrantika, and promoted, among other things, the classical emphasis on the dependent arising of phenomena of the early texts.Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222. Third Turning The first sutra source which mentions the \\"three turnings\\" is the ƒÄrya-sa·πÉdhi-nirmocana-s≈´tra or Noble s≈´tra of the Explanation of the Profound Secrets, the most foundational sutra of the YogƒÅcƒÅra school. The s≈´tra affirms that the earlier turnings while being authentic are also flawed or incomplete and require interpretation. The Sa·πÉdhi-nirmocana further claims that its teachings are the ultimate and final truth. Major ideas include the basis-consciousness (ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna), and the doctrine of cognition-only (vij√±apti-mƒÅtra) and the \\"three natures\\" (trisvabhƒÅva). Some Buddhist traditions also consider the TathƒÅgatagarbha (also known as Buddha nature) teachings as part of this turning. This was elaborated on in great detail by Maitreya via Asanga in the Five Treatises of Maitreya, which are also generally grouped under the third turning. The Yogachara school reoriented later refinements, in all their complexity, so as to accord with the doctrines of earliest Buddhism.Dan Lusthaus, Buddhist Phenomenology. Routledge, 2002, page 43. In Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist tantra and its associated scriptures are sometimes considered to also be part of the third turning.Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, 2002, p. 126.  Other similar classifications  Fourth Turning Vajrayana schools sometimes refer to Buddhist tantra as the \\"fourth turning.\\" As explained by Lama Surya Das, some traditions consider Dzogchen as a fourth turning.Lama Surya Das, Awakening the Buddha Within: Eight Steps to Enlightenment, p. 63.  Sanron school  According to Japanese scholar Junjir≈ç Takakusu, the Sanron (Sanlun) Madhyamaka school divided the teaching into three dharmacakras as well, but with different definitions for each:Junjir≈ç Takakusu, The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1998, p. 109. # The root wheel of the Avatamsaka sutra. # The branch wheel of Hinayana and Mahayana texts. # The wheel that contracts all branches so as to bring them back to the root, the Lotus sutra.

Definitive and provisional The schema of the three turnings is found in Yogachara and TathƒÅgatagarbha texts such as the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra and the Srimala Sutra and likely originated in the Yogachara literature. Naturally, they identify themselves as definitive. However, the schema was later adopted more widely, and different sects and schools of Buddhism, as well as individual Buddhist teachers and philosophers give different explanations as to whether the second or third turnings is 'definitive' (Skt: nitartha) or 'provisional' (Skt: neyartha) or requiring interpretation. In the Tibetan tradition, the Gelug school considers the second turning definitive, as do some scholars in other schools.

It is largely surrounded by a lagoon and is a well known tourist attraction. It is also a refuge for two rare plants, the Mandrinette and the Boucle d'Oreille. The mountain is named after the VOC-ship (Dutch East India Company) Brabant that ran aground here on 29 December 1783 on the cliffs. The peninsula of Le Morne benefits from a micro-climate.

In 2008, the nomination process concluded when UNESCO inscribed the site on the World Heritage List.Inscription of Le Morne into the Word heritage List Peninsula View of the peninsula with Le Morne, as seen from one of the viewpoints of Ebony Forest Chamarel. The peninsula is steeped in cultural \\"myth and legend\\" in the early 19th century as a suggested refuge for Maroons and people who escaped slavery. After the abolition of slavery in Mauritius, on 1 February 1835 it is rumored that a police expedition was dispatched there ostensibly to inform those who escaped slavery that emancipation had made them legally free men and women. The arrival of the police at the base of the mountain was (according to legend) misinterpreted by the former slaves who had scrambled to the summit (fearing that they were to be arrested and re- enslaved) and subsequently elected to leap to their deaths from the rock and commit suicide by landing in the ocean, rather than be recaptured back into slavery. Since 1987 the date is celebrated (particularly by Mauritian creoles) as the Annual Commemoration of the Abolition of Slavery. Le Morne has been declared a World Heritage Site. The monument includes an inscription of this extract from the poem \\"Le Morne Territoire Marron\\" by Richard Sedley Assonne; \\"There were hundreds of them, but my people the maroons chose the kiss of death over the chains of slavery.\\"  Cultural and aesthetic impact  Le Morne Brabant mountain With Aapravasi Ghat, the first World Heritage site of Mauritius, Le Morne highlights the historical significance of slavery and indenture, two labour systems that shaped modern Mauritius. It is a unique conjunction in the Indian Ocean and abroad, and UNESCO has promoted a symbolic meeting of those two systems, to foster a better understanding among the descendants of both the slaves and indentured labourers in the colonial plantation system. Poet Khal Torabully, who developed the concept of coolitude, springing from intercultural strata of his native island, dreams that the memories of indenture and slavery will enhance debate on identity in Mauritius and elsewhere. For him Le Morne Brabant and the Aapravasi Ghat have to be considered as two characters of a collective narrative that will enhance openness and exchanges between cultures and dispel exclusive and sectarian views of identities.

It was founded on December 17, 1956, by Pope Pius XII. It is one of four suffragan dioceses of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Its ecclesiastic territory includes Lake, Porter, LaPorte, and Starke counties in northwestern Indiana. The mother church of the diocese is the Cathedral of the Holy Angels in Gary, Indiana. History During the first half of the 20th century, many Catholic immigrants came from Eastern Europe and Mexico to work in the region's growing steel industry. A number of parishes were founded near the steel mills so that the newly arrived immigrants could celebrate Mass in their native languages. In 1956 the four counties of Lake, Porter, LaPorte, and Starke belonged to the 18 county diocesan territory of the then named Diocese of Fort Wayne. On December 17, 1956, the region was stunned to learn of the announcement that came from they Holy See that a new diocese was to be erected from those four counties in Northwest Indiana and the newly created Diocese of Gary came into existence. On December 29, 1956, Pope Pius XII announced that he had named then Reverend Andrew Gregory Grutka, pastor of Holy Trinity parish, to be the first bishop of the new Gary diocese. The parish of the Holy Angels was selected to become the new cathedral for the diocese, and became the Cathedral of the Holy Angels. The new diocese, at its establishment, found itself with 129 active diocesan priests, 77 parishes, 60 parish schools and 135,485 Catholics, which was roughly 25 percent of the population of the four counties. As of 2012, four parishes in the diocese still offered Mass in Polish, two parishes in Croatian, one in Hungarian, and one in Lithuanian. Fourteen parishes also offered Mass in Spanish. One location offered the 1962 form of the Roman-Rite Mass. Diocese today Serving the diocese are 105 priests, 67 permanent deacons, 10 religious brothers, and 85 religious sisters who are members of various religious institutes. These priests, deacons and persons religious serve a Catholic population in northwest Indiana of 186,420 in 73 parishes and missions. The diocese also operates several educational, medical, and social service organizations. Educational institutions include 17 elementary schools, 3 high schools, 1 college, and a Catholic student center at Valparaiso University. The diocese also supervises six hospitals or medical centers, three homes for the aged, three protective homes, three cemeteries, and Catholic Charities, Diocese of Gary.

HRTEM is a powerful tool to study properties of materials on the atomic scale, such as semiconductors, metals, nanoparticles and sp2-bonded carbon (e.g., graphene, C nanotubes). While HRTEM is often also used to refer to high resolution scanning TEM (STEM, mostly in high angle annular dark field mode), this article describes mainly the imaging of an object by recording the 2D spatial wave amplitude distribution in the image plane, in analogy to a \\"classic\\" light microscope. For disambiguation, the technique is also often referred to as phase contrast TEM. At present, the highest point resolution realised in phase contrast TEM is around . At these small scales, individual atoms of a crystal and its defects can be resolved. For 3-dimensional crystals, it may be necessary to combine several views, taken from different angles, into a 3D map. This technique is called electron crystallography. One of the difficulties with HRTEM is that image formation relies on phase contrast. In phase-contrast imaging, contrast is not necessarily intuitively interpretable, as the image is influenced by aberrations of the imaging lenses in the microscope. The largest contributions for uncorrected instruments typically come from defocus and astigmatism. The latter can be estimated from the so-called Thon ring pattern appearing in the Fourier transform modulus of an image of a thin amorphous film. Image contrast and interpretation Simulated HREM images for GaN[0001] The contrast of a HRTEM image arises from the interference in the image plane of the electron wave with itself. Due to our inability to record the phase of an electron wave, only the amplitude in the image plane is recorded. However, a large part of the structure information of the sample is contained in the phase of the electron wave. In order to detect it, the aberrations of the microscope (like defocus) have to be tuned in a way that converts the phase of the wave at the specimen exit plane into amplitudes in the image plane. The interaction of the electron wave with the crystallographic structure of the sample is complex, but a qualitative idea of the interaction can readily be obtained. Each imaging electron interacts independently with the sample. Above the sample, the wave of an electron can be approximated as a plane wave incident on the sample surface. As it penetrates the sample, it is attracted by the positive atomic potentials of the atom cores, and channels along the atom columns of the crystallographic lattice (s-state model). At the same time, the interaction between the electron wave in different atom columns leads to Bragg diffraction. The exact description of dynamical scattering of electrons in a sample not satisfying the weak phase object approximation (WPOA), which is almost all real samples, still remains the holy grail of electron microscopy. However, the physics of electron scattering and electron microscope image formation are sufficiently well known to allow accurate simulation of electron microscope images. As a result of the interaction with a crystalline sample, the electron exit wave right below the sample œÜe(x,u) as a function of the spatial coordinate x is a superposition of a plane wave and a multitude of diffracted beams with different in plane spatial frequencies u (spatial frequencies correspond to scattering angles, or distances of rays from the optical axis in a diffraction plane). The phase change œÜe(x,u) relative to the incident wave peaks at the location of the atom columns. The exit wave now passes through the imaging system of the microscope where it undergoes further phase change and interferes as the image wave in the imaging plane (mostly a digital pixel detector like a CCD camera). It is important to realize, that the recorded image is NOT a direct representation of the samples crystallographic structure. For instance, high intensity might or might not indicate the presence of an atom column in that precise location (see simulation). The relationship between the exit wave and the image wave is a highly nonlinear one and is a function of the aberrations of the microscope. It is described by the contrast transfer function. The phase contrast transfer function The phase contrast transfer function (CTF) is a function of limiting apertures and aberrations in the imaging lenses of a microscope. It describes their effect on the phase of the exit wave œÜe(x,u) and propagates it to the image wave. Following Williams and Carter, if we assume the WPOA holds (thin sample) the CTF becomes : CTF(u)=A(u)E(u)2\\\\sin(\\\\chi(u)) where A(u) is the aperture function, E(u) describes the attenuation of the wave for higher spatial frequency u, also called envelope function. œá(u) is a function of the aberrations of the electron optical system. The last, sinusoidal term of the CTF will determine the sign with which components of frequency u will enter contrast in the final image. If one takes into account only spherical aberration to third order and defocus, œá is rotationally symmetric about the optical axis of the microscope and thus only depends on the modulus u = |u|, given by : \\\\chi(u)=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}C_s\\\\lambda^3u^4-\\\\pi \\\\Delta f \\\\lambda u^2 where Cs is the spherical aberration coefficient, Œª is the electron wavelength, and Œîf is the defocus. In TEM, defocus can easily be controlled and measured to high precision. Thus one can easily alter the shape of the CTF by defocusing the sample. Contrary to optical applications, defocusing can actually increase the precision and interpretability of the micrographs. The aperture function cuts off beams scattered above a certain critical angle (given by the objective pole piece for ex), thus effectively limiting the attainable resolution. However it is the envelope function E(u) which usually dampens the signal of beams scattered at high angles, and imposes a maximum to the transmitted spatial frequency. This maximum determines the highest resolution attainable with a microscope and is known as the information limit. E(u) can be described as a product of single envelopes: : E(u)=E_s(u)E_c(u)E_d(u)E_v(u)E_D(u),\\\\, due to :Es(u): angular spread of the source :Ec(u): chromatic aberration :Ed(u): specimen drift :Ev(u): specimen vibration :ED(u): detector Specimen drift and vibration can be minimized in a stable environment. It is usually the spherical aberration Cs that limits spatial coherency and defines Es(u) and the chromatic aberration Cc, together with current and voltage instabilities that define the temporal coherency in Ec(u). These two envelopes determine the information limit by damping the signal transfer in Fourier space with increasing spatial frequency u : E_s(u) = \\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\alpha}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\delta\\\\Chi(u)}{\\\\delta u}\\\\right)^2\\\\right] = \\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\alpha}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^2(C_s\\\\lambda^3u^3+\\\\Delta f\\\\lambda u)^2\\\\right], where Œ± is the semiangle of the pencil of rays illuminating the sample. Clearly, if the wave aberration ('here represented by Cs and Œîf) vanished, this envelope function would be a constant one. In case of an uncorrected TEM with fixed Cs, the damping due to this envelope function can be minimized by optimizing the defocus at which the image is recorded (Lichte defocus). The temporal envelope function can be expressed as : E_c(u) = \\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\pi\\\\lambda\\\\delta\\\\right)^2u^4\\\\right],. Here, Œ¥ is the focal spread with the chromatic aberration Cc as the parameter: : \\\\delta = C_c\\\\sqrt{4\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta I_\\\\text{obj}}{I_\\\\text{obj}}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta E}{V_\\\\text{acc}}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta V_\\\\text{acc}}{V_\\\\text{acc}}\\\\right)^2}, The terms \\\\Delta I_\\\\text{obj}/I_\\\\text{obj} and \\\\Delta V_\\\\text{acc}/V_\\\\text{acc} represent instabilities in of the total current in the magnetic lenses and the acceleration voltage. \\\\Delta E/V_\\\\text{acc} is the energy spread of electrons emitted by the source. The information limit of current state-of-the-art TEMs is well below 1 √Ö. The TEAM project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory resultet in the first TEM to reach an information limit of <0.5 √Ö in 2009 by the use of a highly stable mechanical and electrical environment, an ultra- bright, monochromated electron source and double-hexapole aberration correctors. Optimum defocus in HRTEM CTF of the OAM microscope Choosing the optimum defocus is crucial to fully exploit the capabilities of an electron microscope in HRTEM mode. However, there is no simple answer as to which one is the best. In Gaussian focus one sets the defocus to zero, the sample is in focus. As a consequence contrast in the image plane gets its image components from the minimal area of the sample, the contrast is localized (no blurring and information overlap from other parts of the sample). The CTF now becomes a function that oscillates quickly with Csu4. What this means is that for certain diffracted beams with a given spatial frequency u the contribution to contrast in the recorded image will be reversed, thus making interpretation of the image difficult. Scherzer defocus In Scherzer defocus, one aims to counter the term in u4 with the parabolic term Œîfu2 of œá(u). Thus by choosing the right defocus value Œîf one flattens œá(u) and creates a wide band where low spatial frequencies u are transferred into image intensity with a similar phase. In 1949, Scherzer found that the optimum defocus depends on microscope properties like the spherical aberration Cs and the accelerating voltage (through Œª) in the following way: : \\\\Delta f_\\\\text{Scherzer}=-1.2\\\\sqrt{C_s\\\\lambda}\\\\, where the factor 1.2 defines the extended Scherzer defocus. For the CM300 at NCEM, Cs = 0.6mm and an accelerating voltage of 300keV (Œª = 1.97 pm) (Wavelength calculation) result in ŒîfScherzer = -41.25 nm. The point resolution of a microscope is defined as the spatial frequency ures where the CTF crosses the abscissa for the first time. At Scherzer defocus this value is maximized: : u_\\\\text{res}(\\\\text{Scherzer})=0.6\\\\lambda^{3/4} C_s^{1/4}, which corresponds to 6.1 nm‚àí1 on the CM300. Contributions with a spatial frequency higher than the point resolution can be filtered out with an appropriate aperture leading to easily interpretable images at the cost of a lot of information lost. Gabor defocus Gabor defocus is used in electron holography where both amplitude and phase of the image wave are recorded. One thus wants to minimize crosstalk between the two. The Gabor defocus can be expressed as a function of the Scherzer defocus as : \\\\Delta f_\\\\text{Gabor}=0.56\\\\Delta f_\\\\text{Scherzer} Lichte defocus To exploit all beams transmitted through the microscope up to the information limit, one relies on a complex method called exit wave reconstruction which consists in mathematically reversing the effect of the CTF to recover the original exit wave œÜe(x,u). To maximize the information throughput, Hannes Lichte proposed in 1991 a defocus of a fundamentally different nature than the Scherzer defocus: because the dampening of the envelope function scales with the first derivative of œá(u), Lichte proposed a focus minimizing the modulus of dœá(u)/du \\\\Delta f_\\\\text{Lichte}=-0.75 C_s(u_\\\\max\\\\lambda)^2, where umax is the maximum transmitted spatial frequency. For the CM300 with an information limit of 0.8 √Ö Lichte defocus lies at ‚àí272 nm. Exit wave reconstruction Exit wave reconstruction through focal series To calculate back to œÜe(x,u) the wave in the image plane is back propagated numerically to the sample. If all properties of the microscope are well known, it is possible to recover the real exit wave with very high accuracy. First however, both phase and amplitude of the electron wave in the image plane must be measured. As our instruments only record amplitudes, an alternative method to recover the phase has to be used. There are two methods in use today: *Holography, which was developed by Gabor expressly for TEM applications, uses a prism to split the beam into a reference beam and a second one passing through the sample. Phase changes between the two are then translated in small shifts of the interference pattern, which allows recovering both phase and amplitude of the interfering wave. * Through focal series method takes advantage of the fact that the CTF is focus dependent. A series of about 20 pictures is shot under the same imaging conditions with the exception of the focus which is incremented between each take. Together with exact knowledge of the CTF the series allows for computation of œÜe(x,u) (see figure). Both methods extend the point resolution of the microscope past the information limit, which is the highest possible resolution achievable on a given machine. The ideal defocus value for this type of imaging is known as Lichte defocus and is usually several hundred nanometers negative.

He is the first cousin once removed of musician Jeff Tweedy. Despite releasing only a small clutch of recordings, Cousin Herb Henson was a pivotal figure in the development of country music's Bakersfield sound‚Äîhis weekday television variety program, The Trading Post, was a showcase for acts including Buck Owens, Spade Cooley and Merle Haggard, the latter dubbing Henson \\"the Ralph Emery of Bakersfield.\\" Biography Born in East St. Louis, Illinois on May 17, 1925, Henson was a self-taught pianist and sometimes comedian who arrived in California via Union Pacific railcar sometime in the mid-1940s. After picking cotton in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley, he landed a job making door-to-door laundry pickups for a company operating out of the Fresno area. Bandleader Bill Woods convinced Henson to relocate to Bakersfield in 1946, where he worked at local radio station KERO and occasionally performed at area honky tonks such as the now- legendary Clover Club and the Blackboard. In mid-1953, KERO-TV offered him his own weekday broadcast, and The Cousin Herb Henson Trading Post TV Show premiered in September, appearing each afternoon from 5:00 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. Originally co-starring Woods, Billy Mize, and members of the Clover Club house band (including Buck Owens' estranged wife Bonnie), the program's cast would later boast such ace musicians as Roy Nichols, and Dallas Frazier, and its guest stars included Gene Autry, Bob Wills, Johnny Cash, Tex Ritter, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Merle Travis, and Lefty Frizzell. During the program's run, Henson recorded for labels including Tally, Shasta, and Decca, producing his strongest material for Capitol, most notably a 1953 reading of Arlie Duff's \\"Y'All Come\\" that became his theme song. Many of his other singles were novelty efforts ‚Äì e.g., \\"Hootchy Kootchy Henry\\", \\"Board of Education\\", and \\"Space Command\\" ‚Äì and none troubled the charts. When Bakersfield radio station KIKK appointed Henson station manager in 1960, he changed its call letters to KUZZ in honor of his own stage moniker. Around this same time, he suffered a heart attack but continued both his television and radio duties as well as his nightclub appearances. On September 12, 1963, some two dozen country stars (among them Tommy Collins and Roy Clark) descended upon the Bakersfield Civic Center to celebrate The Trading Post‚Ä≤s tenth anniversary; just two months later, on November 26, Henson suffered another massive heart attack, dying at the age of 38.

Tony has a meeting with Jack Massarone, who presents him with a painting of the Rat Pack. Tony has known Massarone a long time, but does not know that he is now an FBI informant. The tip comes from a source of Patsy Parisi's. Tony arranges another meeting and hugs Massarone to find the wire, not realizing it's in his baseball cap. He does not know what to think, but Massarone said one thing out of key: he complimented Tony on losing weight. Tony spends a restless night, then drives to the Pulaski Skyway and tosses Massarone's painting into the river below. Massarone is found dead in the trunk of his car. Another informant, Soprano capo Ray Curto, visits FBI Headquarters to help agents correct a transcript of a meeting he recorded. A third informant, Adriana, is under pressure: \\"I am being ripped apart here, snitching on people!\\" Her FBI handler, Agent Sanseverino, tells her about the family tragedy that impelled her to join the FBI, and says they are both \\"with the good guys now,\\" but this is no comfort for Adriana. At an evening with Carmela and others, talking and drinking wine, Adriana is racked with guilt, inflamed when Rosalie tells her that Big Pussy Bonpensiero's widow, Angie, is not welcome in their group because they think her husband was an informant. A tearful Adriana nearly admits the truth, but instead flees, and stumbles and hurts herself in the driveway. She refuses the women's offers of first aid and speeds away in her car. She then tells Sanseverino that her friend Tina, who has been flirting with Chris, is embezzling money from the company where she works. Tony greets Tony B after he is released from prison. At his welcome- home party at Nuovo Vesuvio, Tony tells a large gathering how important his cousin was in his life growing up. Tony B is disappointed that his ex-wife and twin sons are not there. There is some awkwardness when he seems to mock Tony's weight gain. Tony offers Tony B a place in a stolen airbag operation. However, Tony B is not eager to get back in the business and seeks to go legitimate by becoming a state-licensed massage therapist. A disappointed Tony tells Silvio and Christopher that his cousin is \\"useless.\\" He rebukes Tony B for making jokes about him, as he is now \\"the boss,\\" and for giving massages in the office, but in a late-night phone call, he seems to soften his tone and the two Tonys are reconciled.

Born and brought up in London, with frequent visits to the West End, Hare had a passion for the theatre from his childhood. After acting as an amateur as a young man he joined a professional company in Liverpool, before making his London debut in 1865 at the age of 21 with Marie Wilton's company. Wilton was a pioneer of naturalistic theatre, with which Hare was greatly in sympathy, and he quickly gained a reputation in character roles, particularly in comedies. Within a decade Hare was well enough established to go into management. He was in partnership with the actor W. H. Kendal at the Court Theatre from 1875 to 1879, and from 1879 to 1888 at the St James's Theatre with Kendal and the latter's wife, Madge. They presented, mostly successfully, a succession of new British plays, adaptations of French works, and revivals. At the Garrick Theatre from 1888 to 1895 Hare had a solo managerial career, after which he concentrated on acting ‚Äì in the US, on tour in the British provinces, and in the West End. Among the playwrights with whom Hare was closely associated were T. W. Robertson, W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Wing Pinero. Hare was admired for his carefully observed characterisations, his comedic flair and his handsomely-mounted productions. He was knighted in 1907, and died in London in 1921 at the age of 77, four years after his last stage appearance. Life and career Early years: 1844‚Äì1865 Hare was born and raised in London, the son of Jane Postumous n√©e Armstrong (1801‚Äì1858) and Thomas Fairs (1796‚Äì1848), a London architect.John Joseph Fairs (1844), England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837‚Äì1915, St George's, Hanover Square, Ancestry.com.

Retrieved 15 November 2019 As a teenager he used to play truant to go to West End theatres to see the stars of the day, such as Charles Kean, Frederick Robson, Charles Mathews and J. B. Buckstone. After his parents died Hare was sent by his uncle, his legal guardian, to Giggleswick School, and he was studying for the civil service examination when he was invited to take part in some amateur theatricals. Propelled at the last minute from a small role to the leading part he found his passion for the theatre rekindled.Pemberton, pp. 16‚Äì17 After playing in two further amateur productions ‚Äì as Beauseant in a burlesque on The Lady of Lyons, and Box in Box and Cox ‚Äì he determined to go on the stage. His tutor at Giggleswick recognised that Hare was not cut out for the civil service, and at his urging Hare's uncle agreed to let the young man pursue a stage career.Pemberton, p. 18 upright=.65 Returning to London, Hare studied under the prominent actor Leigh Murray. In September 1864 Murray arranged for Hare to join the company at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Liverpool. Hare's first professional appearance was as Smallpiece in John Oxenford's play, A Woman of Business. Among the company were J. L. Toole (a guest star), Squire Bancroft, Lionel Brough and William Blakeley, with all of whom Hare was quickly on friendly terms.Pemberton, pp. 20‚Äì21 After Toole the company had another visiting star, E.

Sothern, who encouraged the young actor and insisted that he should be cast in a leading comic role in Watts Phillips's new comedy The Woman in Mauve, which Sothern premiered at the theatre in December 1864.\\"Prince of Wales Theatre\\", Liverpool Mercury, 19 December 1864, p. 1 On 12 August 1865 Hare (still known by his original surname, Fairs) married his childhood sweetheart, Mary Adela Elizabeth Holmes (1845‚Äì1931), daughter of John Hare Holmes, whose middle name Hare borrowed for his stage name. The marriage lasted more than fifty years; the couple had one son, Gilbert, who became a successful actor and manager, and two daughters, one of whom, Effie, married Bancroft's son George. As a newly-married man Hare seriously considered leaving the stage in favour of more secure employment in the civil service; nevertheless he wrote to the actress and manager Marie Wilton, seeking to join a new company that she was setting up at the old Prince of Wales's Theatre in London. He was accepted, and his theatrical career in the West End began. The Prince of Wales's and The Court: 1865‚Äì1879 Hare made his London debut in September 1865, playing Short, the landlord, in Naval Engagements, an old comedy by Charles Dance, given as a curtain raiser to H. J. Byron's extravaganza Lucia di Lammermoor.Pemberton, p. 29; and \\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 8 October 1865, p. 11 Two months later Hare came to wide public and critical attention for his performance in T. W. Robertson's comedy Society. The Times later commented: :[Hare] bounded into fame more quickly, perhaps, than any actor of our time. On the eventful evening of November 1, 1865 ‚Äì momentous to the English stage no less than to Hare ‚Äì Tom Robertson's Society was produced, with Hare cast for the small part of Lord Ptarmigant. All the reforms in English acting which the Prince of Wales's Theatre was to achieve could be seen in little in Hare's Lord Ptarmigant: the close attention to detail, the propriety and verisimilitude, the minute finish which the small size of the theatre and stage permitted and which brought the best of English acting for a time on to the same level as the French ‚Äì Lord Ptarmigant had little to do but to go to sleep, but he did it so well that the small part was one of the hits of the production. The theatre writer J. P. Wearing comments, \\"Even though Ptarmigant was a small role, Hare's thorough attention to detail reformed the way in which old male characters were recreated on stage\\". Hare as Sir Peter Teazle and Marie Wilton (Mrs Bancroft) as Lady Teazle, in The School for Scandal in 1874 For the next nine years Hare remained a member of the Prince of Wales's company, appearing in a succession of Robertson's comedies and in other plays produced at the theatre. Among his parts were Prince Perovsky (Ours, Robertson, 1866), Sam Gerridge (Caste, Robertson, 1867), Bruce Fanquehere (Play, Robertson, 1868), Beau Farintosh (School, Robertson, 1869), Dunscombe Dunscombe (M. P., Robertson, 1870), Sir John Vesey (Money, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1872), and Sir Patrick Lundie (adaptation of Man and Wife, Wilkie Collins, 1873). He also appeared in curtain raisers such as Box and Cox, in which, having played Box in his amateur days, he now played Cox. His last part at the Prince of Wales's was in 1874: Sir Peter Teazle in The School for Scandal to the Lady Teazle of Mrs Bancroft, with Bancroft and Charles Coghlan as the Surface brothers. He was praised for rescuing his role from the low comedy treatment it had long suffered, but some thought his portrayal erred in the opposite direction and was too serious.\\"Prince of Wales's Theatre\\", The Standard, 6 April 1874, p. 2; \\"Prince of Wales Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 6 April 1874, p. 6; \\"The Prince of Wales's Theatre\\", The Pall Mall Gazette, 14 April 1874, pp. 11‚Äì12; and \\"The School for Scandal\\", The Era , 26 July 1874, p. 11 Hare left the company in October 1874, when he was unable to master a leading role written for him in Sweethearts by W. S. Gilbert. The author was a close friend and wished to make use both of Hare's naturally boyish appearance and of his talent for impersonating elderly men, contrasting the character in youth in the first act and old age in the second. In rehearsal, Hare struggled with playing the young romantic lead, and eventually, despite Gilbert's advice, he negotiated terms for leaving the company, and Coghlan took over his role.Stedman, pp. 125‚Äì126 For some time Hare had planned to go into theatre management, and he secured the Court Theatre with W. H. Kendal as his silent partner. Kendal's wife, Madge, played the title role in Hare's first production, Coghlan's Lady Flora, on 18 March 1875, with her husband and Hare in the other leading roles. The production and acting were well received, but though the play was praised by The Era, other papers thought little of it.\\"Court Theatre\\", The Era, 14 March 1875, p. 4; \\"Court Theatre\\", The Observer, 14 March 1875, p. 2; \\"Court Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 15 March 1875. p. 3; and \\"Theatres\\", The Graphic, 20 March 1875, p. 279 Hare hoped to continue the tradition of Robertson by fostering new English comedies, but he found that original works by Coghlan and Gilbert were less successful than Coghlan's English version of a French play, A Quiet Rubber, which opened on 8 January 1876, giving Hare one of his greatest successes. In the same year he also did good business with A Scrap of Paper, Palgrave Simpson's adaptation of a French comedy,Morley, p. 205 and a revival of an older English comedy, New Men and Old Acres. As a manager Hare was known for his insistence on having plays attractively staged, well cast and performed exactly as he wanted. Occasionally he could be, in Wearing's phrase, \\"strict and peppery, and even sarcastic\\" at rehearsals, and Madge Kendal recounted a comically ferocious battle of wills between Hare and the equally intransigent Gilbert at a rehearsal of the latter's Broken Hearts in 1875.Kendal, p. 174 Hare did not appear in all his own productions; he was not in the cast of Broken Hearts, although one part was evidently written with him in mind;Pemberton, pp. 53‚Äì54Stedman, p. 135 in one of the greatest successes of his management, Olivia (1878), W. G. Wills's adaptation of The Vicar of Wakefield, he chose not to play the vicar but cast William Terris to co-star with Ellen Terry. His management of the Court ended when his lease expired in 1879. His last presentation there was on 19 July of that year with Robertson's The Ladies' Battle, an adaptation of a French play. St James's Theatre: 1879‚Äì1888 Since its inception in 1835 the St James's, in an unfashionable part of the West End, had acquired a reputation as an unlucky theatre, and more money had been lost than made by successive managements. At the invitation of Lord Newry, the owner of the freehold of the theatre, Hare and the Kendals jointly took over the management of the house in 1879.Duncan, pp. 176 and 184 For the first time, the theatre's reputation was steadily defied. The new lessees aimed both to amuse and to improve public taste,\\"The Hare and Kendal Management at the St James's\\", The Theatre, September 1888, pp. 134‚Äì145 and in Wearing's view they achieved their aim.Wearing, J. P. \\"Hare, Sir John (real name John Joseph Fairs) (1844‚Äì1921), actor and theatre manager\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 10 February 2019 Under their management the St James's staged twenty-one plays: seven were new British pieces, eight adaptations of French plays, and the rest were revivals. Hare aged 35 in one of his many elderly parts, with W. H. Kendal in The Queen's Shilling at the St James's Theatre, 1879 Their first production, on 4 October 1879, was a revival of The Queen's Shilling, one of their Court successes, an adaptation of an old French comedy by Jean-Fran√ßois Bayard.Morley, pp. 203‚Äì205 Madge Kendal had the star part, but her husband's dashing army officer was also well liked, and The Morning Post praised Hare's \\"masterly\\" performance as the old colonel, giving \\"extraordinary zest and brilliancy\\" and \\"bring[ing] down the house in shouts of laughter and applause\\".\\"St James's Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 6 October 1879, p. 6 The partnership had another early success at the beginning of 1880 with a revival of Tom Taylor's popular play, Still Waters Run Deep. The Kendals took the main roles but the laurels went to Hare in the comparatively small part of Potter, a performance described by the writer T. Edgar Pemberton as \\"a masterpiece of character-acting, faultless in get-up and, indeed, in all respects. ‚Ä¶ [A] keen instance of unexaggerated eccentricity\\".Pemberton, p. 78 Wearing regards The Money Spinner (1881) as of particular importance to this period of the theatre's history, being the first of several of A. W. Pinero's plays staged there by Hare and the Kendals. It was regarded as daringly unconventional and a risky venture, but it caught on with the public, partly for Hare's character, the \\"disreputable but delightful old reprobate and card-shark\\" Baron Croodle. Other plays by Pinero given by the Hare-Kendal management at the St James's were The Squire (1881), The Ironmaster (1884), Mayfair (1885) and The Hobby Horse (1886). B. C. Stephenson's comedy Impulse (1883) was a substantial success and was revived by public demand two months after the end of its first run. There was a mixed reception of a rare excursion into Shakespeare, As You Like It (1885): Madge Kendal's Rosalind was much liked,Foulkes, Richard. \\"Kendal, Dame Madge [real name Margaret Shafto Robertson; married name Margaret Shafto Grimston (1848‚Äì1935), actress\\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2013.

Among the company in these years the actresses included Fanny Brough, Helen Maud Holt and the young May Whitty;Parker, p. 986 among their male colleagues were George Alexander, Allan Aynesworth, Albert Chevalier, Henry Kemble, William Terris, Brandon Thomas and Lewis Waller. Hare and the Kendals concluded their management partnership in 1888 with a farewell season of revivals of their greatest successes. 1889‚Äì1899 Grundy's A Pair of Spectacles (1890) In 1889 Hare resumed a managerial career, taking charge of the new Garrick Theatre, built for and owned by W. S. Gilbert. The cost of building the theatre had been unexpectedly high, with the result that Hare had to pay a substantial annual rent of about ¬£4,000 for his tenancy.Ainger, p. 284 He opened on 24 April 1889 with Pinero's The Profligate, in which he played the part of Lord Dangars. The play received mixed reviews but ran for seven months.\\"Theatres\\", The Times, 21 November 1889, p. 8 Two other Pinero plays followed during Hare's tenure: Lady Bountiful (1891), and The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith (1895), with Mrs Patrick Campbell in the latter. Two other notable productions at the Garrick were Grundy's A Pair of Spectacles (1890), which became Hare's greatest popular success, and a revival of Diplomacy, with a cast that included the Bancrofts, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Arthur Cecil and Hare's son Gilbert, as well as Hare himself.\\"Diplomacy at The Garrick\\", The Era, 25 February 1893, p. 11 Less successful productions included an English version of Sardou's melodrama La Tosca (1889) and Grundy's comedy An Old Jew (1894), both of which were taken off after short runs. Hare concluded his career as a manager on 15 June 1895 with a double bill of A Pair of Spectacles' and A Quiet Rubber.\\"The Garrick\\", The Era, 22 June 1895, p. 8 Hare made his American debut in January 1896, appearing at Abbey's Theatre, New York, with a company including Julia Neilson and Fred Terry, in The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith, A Pair of Spectacles, A Quiet Rubber, and Gilbert's Comedy and Tragedy.\\"Good Plays, Well Acted\\", The New York Times, 7 January 1896, p. 4 The Times reported his American visit as \\"immensely successful ... contrary to some expectations, his very quiet, delicate art found many admirers\\". He returned to the US in 1897 and 1900‚Äì1901 and became almost as well known there as in Britain. In the West End in 1899 Hare had one of his greatest box-office and critical successes in the title role of Pinero's The Gay Lord Quex. The play divided opinion among the reviewers, although more were in favour than not, but the notices for Hare were uniformly enthusiastic.\\"The Gay Lord Quex at the Globe\\", The Observer, 9 April 1899, p. 5; \\"Globe Theatre\\", The Times, 10 April 1899, p. 3; \\"Our London Correspondence\\", The Manchester Guardian, 10 April 1899, p. 5; \\"Mr. Pinero's New Play\\", The Illustrated London News, 15 April 1899, p. 528 The Pall Mall Gazette said: \\"Mr John Hare has done few things better: dignified, courteous, urbane, he suggests with infinite tact the presence of a jeunesse orageuse.\\"\\"The Gay Lord Quex at The Globe\\", The Pall Mall Gazette, 10 April 1899, p. 2 The Morning Post commented that Hare had \\"added one more to a long series of triumphs\\".\\"Globe Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 10 April 1899, p. 6 The Era called his Lord Quex \\"a masterpiece of comic acting\\" and said that no other actor in England could have played the part as he did.\\"The Gay Lord Quex\\", The Era, 15 April 1899, p. 13 20th century Hare's last role in a new play was Lord Carlton in J. M. Barrie's Little Mary (1903). Reviewing the production in The Saturday Review, Max Beerbohm wrote of Hare's performance, \\"One watches him with the same pleasure one has in sipping a glass of very good dry sherry\\".Beerbohm, Max. \\"Little Mary\\", The Saturday Review, 3 October 1903, p. 423 Not for the first time, Hare received better notices than the play,\\"New Play by Mr. J.

In 1907 he began what was billed as a farewell British tour; he also appeared in that year in royal command performances for Edward VII, in A Quiet Rubber at Sandringham and A Pair of Spectacles at Windsor Castle. At the Sandringham presentation he was knighted. In 1908 he gave what were billed as farewell performances of The Gay Lord Quex and A Pair of Spectacles at the Garrick. He said at the time that he would return only if someone were to offer him a new play so good as to be irresistible. Hare appeared in three films: Caste (1915), The Vicar of Wakefield and A Pair of Spectacles (both 1916).\\"Caste (1913)\\"; \\"The Vicar of Wakefield (1916)\\"; and \\"A Pair of Spectacles (1916)\\", British Film Institute. Retrieved 13 November 2019 His last appearances on stage were in July 1917, when he revived A Pair of Spectacles, making a large sum for wartime charities, and in September of that year when he appeared in the same play at Wyndham's Theatre. The Observer commented on the enjoyment given by \\"a still beautiful, amusing, touching performance; a performance which offers the not too common experience of an actor enjoying his part, playing it beautifully because he believes in it, and making us, too, believe in it and enjoy it\\".\\"A Pair of Spectacles: Last Night's Revival at Wyndham's Theatre\\", The Observer, 2 September 1917, p. 8 In December 1921 Hare fell ill with influenza and then pneumonia. He died on 28 December 1921 at his home in Queen's Gate, London, aged 77. After a funeral service at St Margaret's, Westminster, he was buried in Hampstead Cemetery on 31 December. Reputation A few years after Hare's death, a biographer wrote that his art \\"was in the modern English tradition, which he helped to a considerable extent to mould and to develop\\". His naturalistic style avoided the formality of the older English stage and suggested character by \\"tricks of deportment and facial expression that complete or illuminate the phrases of the author\\". The same writer commented that behind Hare's art was \\"a personality of rare modesty and charm, that instinctively avoided exaggeration and had a genuine dislike of publicity\\". In The Times's view, Hare was greatly loved for his personal charm both onstage and off (\\"in spite of a somewhat peppery temper\\") and for his precise observation: :[He] was a master of the art of impersonation. His every movement and look was eloquent, and not Coquelin a√Æn√© himself could tell you more about a character from the way he stood or coughed or held his hands than could Hare. Such perfection of finish has not been equalled on the stage of our times. Wearing writes, \\"The roles he tackled were memorable because of his mastery of impersonation, and he was particularly adept at expressing gentle emotions with perfect simplicity. He strived for natural deportment and facial expression, and never degenerated into caricature.\\" Wearing adds that as a manager Hare encouraged English dramatists and actors \\"and generally improved the stage\\". The Daily Telegraph said: :It may be doubted if the stage of any period has been able to boast a comedian so delicate in touch, so admirably finished in detail, or so consummate in artistic appreciation as John Hare.Obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 29 December 1921, p. 9 Notes, references and sources Notes References Sources    * External links Photo and profile of Hare at Cyranos *Photo and profile of Hare at CollectorsPost *Photo of Hare from 1911 * New York Times Review of Hare from 1897 *New York Times Review of Hare and Irene Vanbrugh from 1900 Category:1844 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Actors awarded knighthoods Category:English male silent film actors Category:English male stage actors Category:Actor-managers Category:Knights Bachelor Category:People educated at Giggleswick School Category:Male actors from London Category:20th-century English male actors ","title":"John Hare (actor)"},{"id":"4527793","text":"George Pal's Puppetoons were a series of animated puppet films made in Europe in the 1930s and in the United States in the 1940s. They are memorable for their use of replacement animation: using a series of different hand-carved wooden puppets (or puppet heads or limbs) for each frame in which the puppet moves or changes expression, rather than moving a single puppet, as is the case with most stop motion puppet animation. The series began when Pal made an advertising film using \\"dancing\\" cigarettes in 1932, which led to a series of theatrical advertising shorts for Philips Radio in the Netherlands. This was followed by a series for Horlicks Malted Milk in England. These shorts have an art deco design, often reducing characters to simple geometric shapes. A typical Puppetoon required 9,000 individually carved and machined wooden figures or parts. Pal came to the U.S. in 1940, and produced more than 40 Puppetoons for Paramount Pictures between 1941 and 1947. Seven Puppetoons received Academy Award nominations, including Rhythm in the Ranks (for the year 1941), Tulips Shall Grow (1942), The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins (1943), And To Think I Saw it On Mulberry Street (1944), Jasper and the Beanstalk (1945), John Henry and the Inky-Poo (1946) and Tubby the Tuba (1947). (Info source: AMPAS Animated Short Film Oscar archives.) The series ended due to rising production costs which had increased from $18,000 per short in 1939 to almost $50,000 following the war. Paramount Pictures, Pal's distributor, objected to the cost. Per their suggestion Pal went to produce sequences for feature films.Cohen (2004), p. 58 In 1956, the Puppetoons as well as most of Paramount's shorts, were sold to television distributor U.M. & M. TV Corporation. National Telefilm Associates bought out U.M. & M. and continued to syndicate them in the 1950s and 1960s as \\"Madcap Models\\". Pal also used the Puppetoon name and the general Puppetoon technique for miniature puppet characters in some of his live-action feature films, including The Great Rupert (1949), Tom Thumb (1958), and The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1963). In these films, the individual wooden figures were billed as The Puppetoons. In 1986, film producer-director-archivist Arnold Leibovit, a friend of George Pal, collected several Puppetoons and released them theatrically and to video as The Puppetoon Movie reintroducing them to contemporary audiences. A feature-length documentary on the life and films of George Pal followed. Jasper  Some controversy exists in modern times, as the black character, Jasper, star of several Puppetoons in the 1940s is considered a stereotype today. Pal described Jasper as the Huckleberry Finn of American folklore.Cohen (2004), p. 58 Already in 1946, an article of the Hollywood Quarterly protested that the Jasper shorts presented a \\"razor- totin', ghost-haunted, chicken-stealin' concept of the American Negro\\".Cohen (2004), p. 58 A 1947 article in Ebony pointed that George Pal was a European and not raised on racial prejudice. \\"To him there is nothing abusive about a Negro boy who likes to eat watermelons or gets scared when he goes past a haunted house\\". The article, though, pointed that this depiction touched on the stereotypes of Negroes being childish, eating nothing but molasses and watermelons, and being afraid of their own shadows.Cohen (2004), p. 58 Preservation The Academy Film Archive preserved several of the Puppetoons in 2009, including Jasper and the Beanstalk, John Henry and the Inky Poo, and Rhythm In the Ranks.

Impact attenuators are designed to absorb the colliding vehicle's kinetic energy. They may also be designed to redirect the vehicle away from the hazard or away from roadway machinery and workers. Impact attenuators are usually placed in front of fixed structures near highways, such as gore points, crash barrier introductions, or overpass supports. Temporary versions may be used for road construction projects. Operation Impact attenuators are designed to absorb the colliding vehicle's kinetic energy to bring it to a stop safely. If no impact attenuator is present, a vehicle which strikes a rigid roadside object will suddenly stop. A person inside will promptly collide with the interior of the vehicle, and that person's internal organs will collide with their chest wall, causing severe internal injuries and possibly death. By safely dissipating the vehicle's kinetic energy, impact attenuators help prevent such injuries. Impact attenuators can be categorized by the method used to dissipate kinetic energy: # Momentum transfer. Many early models used successive rows of sand- or water-filled barrels or modules. Momentum is transferred to the sand or water, reducing the speed of the impacting vehicle. # Material deformation. Many newer attenuators use crushable materials (like various kinds of foam) that create a crumple zone, absorbing energy. Others flatten a corrugated steel guard rail section, or split a steel box beam. # Friction. Some attenuators work by forcing a steel cable or strap through an angled slot or tube, converting kinetic energy into heat.  Types   Gating  Gating impact attenuators allow vehicles impacting from the side to pass through them (akin to a gate). Gating attenuators are more economical, but require a greater clear space surrounding them to be effective; without enough space, errant cars may pass through into another hazard, such as into lanes of opposing traffic.  Water-filled attenuators  A water-filled attenuator, as seen in Auckland, New Zealand. Water-filled attenuators consist of containers filled with water to absorb impact energy. They are typically not anchored to the ground, and therefore benefit from easy deployment and relocation using barrier transfer machines and cranes. They are non- redirective, meaning they do not deflect vehicles that impact the side back into the roadway. The energy of the impacting vehicle accelerates the water in the barrels vertically and laterally consuming that energy in work done on the water. Additionally, this work is done over time which reduces the deceleration (negative acceleration) applied to the vehicle occupants. A smaller amount of energy is consumed in the work of crumpling the plastic containers. In cold climates, water-filled attenuators are either avoided, or have additives such as magnesium chloride salt added to them to prevent freezing.  Fitch barriers  Fitch barriers in Canada. A Fitch barrier consists of sand-filled plastic barrels, usually yellow-colored with a black lid. The \\"Fitch Highway Barrier System\\" was invented by race car driver John Fitch after the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race when his co-driver, Pierre Levegh, veered out of control and into the crowd. The car burst into flames and took the lives of Pierre and 84 spectators in one of the worst accidents in racing history. He stated he was inspired by sand-filled fuel cans which he used to protect his tent from strafing during World War II. Early prototypes were self funded and tested due to low initial support. As a proof of concept Fitch used liquor barrels filled with sand to create the necessary impact attenuation, then personally crashed reinforced vehicles into them while recording with a high speed camera to capture the rate of deceleration. Fitch barriers are often found in a triangular arrangement at the end of a guard rail between a highway and an exit lane (the area known as the gore), along the most probable line of impact. The barriers in front contain the least sand, with each successive barrel containing more, so that when a vehicle collides with the barrels they shatter, the kinetic energy is dissipated by scattering the sand, and the vehicle decelerates smoothly instead of violently striking a solid obstruction, reducing the risk of injury to the occupants. Fitch barriers are widely popular due to their effectiveness, low cost, and ease of setup and repair or replacement. Since first being used in the late 1960s, it is estimated that they have saved as many as 17,000 lives and approximately $400 million per year in property damages and medical expenses.  Non-gating  A crash cushion can be seen where this New Zealand road splits into two. Non-gating impact attenuators arrest the motion of vehicles that impact head-on, whilst deflecting vehicles that impact the side of the barrier. They are anchored and more expensive, but can be used in tighter spaces.  Crash cushions  Crash cushions are constructed of multiple segments, which crumple into each other when collided with to absorb the impact. Their main benefit is in their reusability; these attenuators can automatically return to their original position after a crash. Truck mounted attenuators A Truck-Mounted Attenuator (TMA) in New Zealand. Truck mounted attenuators (TMA), similar in some ways to railcar buffers, can be deployed on vehicles that are prone to being struck from behind, such as snow plows and road construction or maintenance vehicles. Work zone regulations often specify a minimum buffer distance between the attenuator truck and the work area, and a minimum mass for the truck, to minimize the chances that the truck will be pushed forward by a crash into the workers or machinery. This is especially important in mobile work zones where the truck's parking brake may not be engaged. The truck may also be in movement (albeit slower than the vehicles that could crash into it). Regulation In the United States, impact attenuators are tested and classified according to AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH), which superseded the Federal Highway Administration NCHRP Report 350. Classification is based on the maximum speed of a vehicle during a collision for which the attenuator is designed.

History The archdiocese was originally established as the Vicariate Apostolic of Indian Territory East of the Rocky Mountains on July 19, 1850 by Pope Pius IX. It was composed of the present day states of Kansas, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It lost territory and its name was changed to the Vicariate Apostolic of Kansas in 1857. The vicariate was elevated to the Diocese of Leavenworth by Pope Leo XIII on May 22, 1877. It lost territory in 1887 when the dioceses of Concordia and Wichita were created, and in 1897 when several counties were moved to Concordia. The name of the diocese was changed to the Diocese of Kansas City in Kansas on May 10, 1947 by Pope Pius XII. All of these jurisdictions were in the Ecclesiastical Province of Saint Louis. The Diocese of Kansas City in Kansas was elevated to an archdiocese by Pius XII on August 9, 1952.

A revised version was published near the end of May 1821 as opus 4, number 1. The words are taken from a German poem by Georg Philipp Schmidt (von L√ºbeck). The lied is set in the key of C-sharp minor with the tempo marking sehr langsam (very slow) and the time signature alla breve. The piece has a total of 72 measures. Schubert wrote another lied entitled \\"Der Wanderer;\\" it is numbered D.649.  Detailed description of Der Wanderer  The song begins with a recitative, describing the setting: mountains, a steaming valley, the roaring sea. The wanderer is strolling quietly, unhappily, and asks, sighing, the question: \\"where?\\" The next section, consisting of 8 bars of a slow melody sung in pianissimo, describes the feelings of the wanderer: the sun seems cold, the blossom withered, life old. The wanderer expresses the conviction of being a stranger everywhere. This 8-bar section was later used by Schubert as theme on which his Wanderer Fantasy is based. Next the music shifts to the key of E major, the tempo increases and the time signature changes to 6/8. The wanderer asks: \\"where are you my beloved land?\\" This place the wanderer longs for is described as green with hope, \\"the land where my roses bloom, my friends stroll, my dead rise\\" and, finally, \\"the land which speaks my language, Oh land, where are you?\\" Towards the end of this section, the music gets quite animated and forms the climax of the song. Finally, the music returns to the original minor key and slow tempo. After quoting the question \\"where?\\" from the opening, the song closes with a \\"ghostly breath\\" finally answering the question: \\"There where you are not, there is happiness.\\" The song closes in the key of E major.

Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 649. was an English potter credited with innovations and improvements in earthenware associated with Staffordshire figures. Although an important figure, as with Thomas Whieldon there is considerable uncertainty over which actual pieces were made in his pottery. This has led to some museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art now calling all its pieces \\"Style of John Astbury\\". Life and work Teapot, c. 1750, Style of John Astbury, lead- glazed earthenware. Astbury was reputed to have masqueraded as an idiot in order to gain access to the works of the Elers brothers, John Philip and David, Dutch emigrants who had settled in Bradwell, Staffordshire, about 1690. He discovered the secrets of their manufacture of red ware pottery, and set up a rival establishment at Shelton, also in The Potteries. He introduced the use of Bideford pipeclay, and in 1720, happening to notice a hostler blowing powder from a red-hot flintstone pulverised into the eyes of a horse as a remedy, hit upon the application of calcined flint in pottery, which greatly improved his ware. His style of decorating with appliqu√©s is called sprigging. His experiments in adding materials such as flint to potting clay led to changes in color and texture emulated by others. His early work with adding lead to glaze influenced creamware and the later work by Josiah Wedgwood. He died in Shelton 1743, aged 55, and was buried in Stoke churchyard, having made a fortune, and leaving several sons. Family and influence One son, Thomas Astbury, had begun business in Lane Delph, Stoke, in 1725, and was the first English manufacturer of what came to be called creamware.

History In the October 2004 election, Action Hobson were successful in electing two councillors, Christine Caughey and Richard Simpson and a majority on the local Hobson Community Board. After the 2004 election, Action Hobson's two councillors came under significant criticism for breaking their promises on council rates. In the leadup to the election, they had promised to be conservative and cap rates to inflation. However, Action Hobson's support for City Vision saw rates increases of 9.7% in 2005 and 13.2% in 2006, causing a backlash with voters. Action Hobson also placed an emphasis on heritage policy as a part of their broad direction. In the October 2007 election, Action Hobson's candidates were all defeated, as part of a broad swing to the centre- right.

Designed in 1991 by Steve Harper, the Scorpion III features a GRP body tub which is bonded to a space frame chassis underneath, and employs a BMW K-series motorcycle engine as its power plant. The engine, gearbox and final drive from the motorcycle are utilised with a special rear wheel which is fitted with a car tyre, as are the front wheels. It has a very good power-to-weight ratio which endows it with excellent performance. The rear wheel is of a smaller circumference than the bike's wheel so the gearing is optimised for a lower top speed of around with 0-60 mph (97 km/h) taking around 6 seconds when using a K1100 engine. Any BMW K engine can be used, from a 750 cc 3-cylinder, to a 1200 cc, 4-cylinder, giving power outputs from to . The motorcycle sequential gearchange is retained and operated via a gear shift inside the cockpit and requires a forward or backward movement to change gear. The brake, accelerator and clutch operate as per a car and are adjustable for reach to accommodate drivers of different size. The seat and steering wheel are fixed in position. Handling is generally considered to be good due to the low centre of gravity and wide front track (approx ) although care is needed when roads are wet. A turbo charged engine kit is available from BBR racing which increases power to around for an 1100 cc engine. There are two seats, and there is provision above the engine to accommodate some luggage which is roughly equivalent to two sports bags. The trikes are sold as complete kits which everything needed to finish including washers, ty-wraps etc. or as completed vehicles.

The island is part of the commune (municipality) of Mar√©, in the Loyalty Islands Province of New Caledonia. Geography Cap Wabao on Mar√©, showing the rough coral rock (foreground) and narrow fringing reef. The high, flat peak of Cap Wabao in the background is a former reef islet. The characteristic Araucaria trees cover most flat land near the sea. The island is long and 16 to 33 km (10 to 20 miles) wide. It lies northeast of Grande Terre, New Caledonia's mainland. Like its neighbor to the north Lifou, Mar√© is a raised coral atoll, a former atoll that has been lifted about 120 meters. The interior of the island is the former lagoon, surrounded by a rim of higher land that was the ring of reef islets. Its fossil coral rock is honeycombed with caves, pools, and pits of all sizes, whose sharp edges make for difficult walking. Because of the lifting, the current shoreline is relatively recent and supports only short sections of nearshore fringing reef, unlike the extensive barrier reef found on the main island of New Caledonia, Grande Terre. The narrow beaches of Mar√© are often backed by cliffs. Villages include, from north-southwards, Roh, Thogone, Kaewatine, Tenane, Hnawayaca, Wakuaori, Menaku, Padawa, Kaewaura, Pakada, Atha, Tadurehmu, Nece, La Roche, Tuo, Miramas, Wakone, Hanadid, Rawa, Tawainedr, Mebuet, Tadine, Cuaden, Cengeite, Penelo, Patho, Wabao, Medu, Kurin, and Eni. Commune The commune of Mar√© is made up of Mar√© Island and the much smaller Dudune Island, which lie among the Loyalty Islands, to the northeast of New Caledonia's mainland. The settlement of Tadin, on Mar√© Island, is the administrative centre of the commune of Mar√©. People The population of Mar√© is about 6900, of mainly Melanesian heritage (less than 2% of the population is of European ancestry). The indigenous language is Nengon√©, one of the Austronesian languages, widely spoken in island regions from Madagascar to Indonesia, coastal New Guinea and on most Pacific islands. There are two small towns of Tadine and La Roche, but most Mar√©ans live in tribes associated with one of 29 chieftaincies (chefferie), that are closed to outsiders. Mar√©ans are often fervent Christians, following extensive missionary activity by the competing Protestant (London Missionary Society) and Catholic (Marist)churches during the late 19th century. Sectarian hostility has led to episodic intertribal violence over the years. Mar√© has produced several important leaders of the militant Front de Lib√©ration Nationale Kanak Socialiste (Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, or FLNKS), which seeks independence from France. The Front was founded by a former grand chief of Mar√©, Nidoish Naisseline around 1970. Another Mar√©an, Yeiwene Yeiwene, was deputy to the Front's leader Jean-Marie Tjibaou during the violence of the early 1980s and the signing of the Matignon Accords on 26 June 1988 that brought peace. Seen as traitors by militant elements of the FLNKS, Tjibaou and Yeiwene were assassinated on the island of Ouvea on 4 May 1989. The gravesite of Yeiwene by the sea near Tadine on the west coast of Mar√© is maintained with often-renewed flower garlands. European sighting The first recorded sighting of Mar√© Island by a European occurred around August 1793.

It provides sensory innervation to some structures around the nasal cavity.  Structure  The anterior ethmoidal nerve is a terminal branch of the nasociliary nerve. It branches near the medial wall of the orbit and travels through the anterior ethmoidal foramen to reach the anterior cranial fossa. It then moves forward and passes through the cribriform plate to enter the nasal cavity. It gives off branches to the roof of the nasal cavity and bifurcates into a lateral internal nasal branch and medial internal nasal branch. The nerve is the continuation of the nasociliary nerve after it enters the anterior ethmoidal foramen into the anterior ethmoidal air cells. The nasociliary nerve arises from the Ophthalmic division of the Trigeminal nerve (CN V) within the orbit. The anterior ethmoidal nerve arises only after the nasociliary has given off its four branches - 1) Ramus communicans to ciliary ganglion, 2) Long ciliary nerves, 3) infratrochlear nerve, 4) Posterior ethmoidal nerve. After branching off of the nasociliary nerve, the anterior ethmoidal nerve enters the anterior ethmoidal foramen and send sensory fibers to the middle and anterior ethmoidal air cells. The anterior ethmoidal nerve then continues into the cranial cavity at the side of the cribiform plate of the ethmoid bone, sends sensory fibers to the meninges, and then enters the nasal cavity via the nasal slit. Within the nose, this nerve gives off sensory fibers to the anterior part of the nasal septum The branches it gives rise to are called the internal/septal and external nasal branches of the anterior ethmoidal nerve, and the external branch ultimately innervates skin on the lateral sides of the nose.

The term also refers to the music and the characteristic step of the dance. History Beginnings and courtly adoption The name branle derives from the French verb branler (to shake, wave, sway, wag, wobble), referring to the side-to-side movement of a circle or chain of dancers holding hands or linking arms . Dances of this name are encountered from about 1500 and the term is used for dances still danced in France today . Before this the word is encountered in dance only as the \\"swaying\\" step of the basse danse. The branle was danced by a chain of dancers, usually in couples, with linked arms or holding hands. The dance alternated a number of larger sideways steps to the left (often four) with the same number of smaller steps to the right so that the chain moved gradually to the left. Although originally French dances of rustic provenance, danced to the dancers' singing, the branle was adopted, like other folk-dances, into aristocratic use by the time that printed books allow us to reconstruct the dances. A variety of branles, attributed to different regions, were danced in sequence, so that the suite of branle music gives one of the earliest examples of the classical suite of dances. Such suites generally ended with a gavotte, which seems then to have been regarded as a species of branle. Some aristocratic branles included pantomime elements, such the branle de Poitou, the possible ancestor of the minuet, which acts out gestures of courtship. Some of these dances were reserved for specific age groups - the branle de Bourgogne, for instance, for the youngest dancers. Branle music is generally in common time somewhat like the gavotte, though some variants, like that of Poitou, are in triple time . Branles were danced walking, running, gliding, or skipping depending on the speed of the music. Among the dance's courtly relations may be the basse danse and the passepied which latter, though it is in triple time, Rabelais and Thoinot Arbeau (1589) identify as a type of Breton branle. The branle in Arbeau The first detailed sources for the dance's steps are found in Arbeau's famous text-book Orchesography. Antonius de Arena briefly describes the steps for the double and single branle , and John Marston's The Malcontent (1604) sketches the choreography of one type. According to , every ball began with the same four branles: the double, the single, the gay and the Burgundian branle. The double branle had a simple form involving two phrases of two bars each. Arbeau gives choreographies for eight branles associated with specific regions; the Burgundian (see above) or Champagne, the Haut Barrois, the Montardon, the Poitou, the Maltese, the Scottish and the Trihory of Brittany; he also mentions four others without describing their steps; the branles of Camp, Hainaut, Avignon, and Lyon . Most of these dances seem to have a genuine connection to the region: the Trihory of Brittany, Arbeau says, was seldom if ever performed around Langres where his book was published, but \\"I learned it long ago from a young Breton who was a fellow student of mine at Poitiers\\" . On the other hand, Arbeau identifies some branles as adapted to ballet and mime. When his student Capriol asks whether the Maltese branle is native to Malta, rather than just \\"a fanciful invention for a ballet\\", Arbeau replies that he \\"cannot believe it to be other than a ballet\\" . He also describes a \\"Hermit\\" branle based upon mime. The suite of branles There were several well-established branle suites of up to ten dances; the Branles de Champagne, the Branles de Camp, the Branles de Hainaut and the Branles d'Avignon. Arbeau named these suites branles coup√©s, which literally means \\"cut\\" or \\"intersected\\" branles but is usually translated as \\"mixed branles\\" . Antonius de Arena mentions mixed branles (') in his macaronic treatise Ad suos compagnones , By 1623 such suites had been standardized into a set of six dances: premier bransle, bransle gay, bransle de Poictou (also called branle √† mener), bransle double de Poictou, cinquiesme bransle (by 1636 named branle de Montirand√©), and a concluding gavotte . A variant is found in the Tablature de mandore (Paris, 1629) by Fran√ßois, Sieur de Chancy. A suite of seven dances collectively titled Branles de Boccan begins with a branle du Baucane, composed by the dancing master and violinist Jacques Cordier, known as \\"Bocan\\", followed by a second, untitled branle then the branle gay, branle de Poictu, branle double de Poictu, branle de Montirand√© and la gavotte . The fame of the branle In the late 16th century in England the branle was mentioned by Shakespeare (Love's Labour's Lost, 3. 1. 7: \\"Will you win your love with a French brawl?\\"). In the 17th century it was danced at the courts of Louis XIV of France and Charles II of England, where it became \\"even more common than in France\\" . There are even a few late examples in Beauchamp‚ÄìFeuillet notation (invented in 1691), such as Danses nouvelles presentees au Roy (c. 1715) by Louis-Guillaume P√©cour. In Italy the branle became the brando, and in Spain the bran . The Branle seems to have travelled to Scotland and survived for some time as the brail. Emmanuel Adriaenssen includes a piece called Branle Englese in his book of lute music, Pratum Musicum (1584) and Thomas Tomkins' Worster Braules is included in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. But of thousands of lute pieces from England only 18 were called branle, though one called \\"courant\\" is known from continental sources as a branle . Branles not choreographed by Arbeau The Branle de Montirand√© appears to be related to the Haut Barrois branle, which Arbeau says was \\"arranged to the tune of a branle of Montierandal\\" (probably Montier-en- Der, near Chaumont in the Haute Marne) . This is danced in duple time, and as described by Arbeau has a similar structure to the double branle. Settings for this appear in the lute anthology Le tr√©sor d'Orph√©e by Anthoine Francisque (1600) and the ensemble collection Terpsichore by Michael Praetorius (1612). In John Marston's The Malcontent (1604), act 4, scene 2, the character Guerrino describes the steps of a dance called Beanchaes brawl (Bianca's branle): > t'is but two singles on the left, two on the right, three doubles forward, a > trauerse of six round: do this twice, three singles side, galliard tricke of > twentie, curranto pace; a figure of eight, three singles broken downe, come > vp, meete two doubles, fall backe, and then honour. The opening is the same as the Maltese branle described by Arbeau, but starting with \\"three singles side\\", there is an interpolation of \\"something presumably more athletic\\". The male dancer moves away from his partner before performing a \\"galliard trick of twenty\\"‚Äîapparently a number of capers or leaps in the manner of the galliard‚Äîbefore returning to the conventional ending .

The palisade walls form an integral part of the load- bearing system. Construction Palisade walls This type of construction is often believed to predate a construction method with posts set directly into the earth, sometimes called a post church, and the later stave construction method, or stave church. A palisade church often had its walls set fully or partly in gravel and therefore they can be detected in archaeological surveys. Sometimes a new church was built around an existing one, and remnants of the old church can be found under the floor. The palisade church construction itself consisted, in its simplest form, of posts set closely together into a trench in the earth, with the roof resting directly on top of the logs. Later the logs were split in two halves, with the flat side facing into the enclosed room. The edges could be straight, or tongued and grooved. To prevent rapid deterioration, the logs or stave-planks were charred at the lower end and impregnated with pine-tar. The rows of stave-planks also rested in a ditch of gravel. Nevertheless, they were still susceptible to damp and eventually deteriorated. For a long time it was assumed that this style of church building had disappeared before the year 1000, yet later research has shown it to be quite common as late as the 13th century. No such church exists in Norway, nor is there found any remnants of any such church, even though most of the stave churches in existence today are located in Norway. Only one palisade church is known to survive. Greensted Church in England still has its massive palisade walls. Although much debated, it is often classified as the remnants of a palisade church or, more loosely, as a stave church. For a long time this church was assumed to be the world's oldest wooden church, as a dendrochronological dating estimated its construction to 845 CE.

It covers Allen, Bourbon, Butler, Chase, Chautauqua, Cherokee, Cowley, Crawford, Elk, Greenwood, Harper, Harvey, Kingman, Labette, Marion, McPherson, Montgomery, Morris, Neosho, Reno, Rice, Sedgwick, Sumner, Wilson, and Woodson counties in south central and southeast Kansas. The diocese is home to 120,115 Catholics in 90 parishes. It is a suffragan see of the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas. History The first resident pastor within the area now known as the Diocese of Wichita was appointed in 1873. The Vicariate of Kansas came to an end when the Diocese of Leavenworth, covering the entire state, was established in 1877, with Bishop Fink as first bishop. Kansas grew so rapidly over the next ten years that Bishop Fink petitioned the Holy Father to establish two new Sees in Kansas, one at Wichita and the other at Concordia. The petition having been granted, in 1887 the western two- thirds of the state was divided equally in half. The north became the Diocese of Concordia and the south became the Diocese of Wichita. Reverend James O'Reilly, pastor in Topeka, Kansas, was appointed the first bishop of Wichita. However, he became ill and died before being consecrated, leaving the new diocese without a bishop for a year. In 1888, Reverend John J. Hennessy, pastor in St. Louis, Missouri, was appointed Bishop of Wichita. Bishop Hennessy found a struggling new diocese, missionary in nature. The first census in 1889 gave the Catholic population as 8,000, with 16 priests. Bishop Hennessy was Bishop of Wichita for 32 years. Because of the small number of Catholics in the diocese, the Holy See eventually added nine counties in southeast Kansas to the Diocese of Wichita. Within the first couple of decades of the 1900s the Catholic population was up to 32,000 and there were 97 parishes, most with schools. Bishop Hennessy built a new Cathedral, honoring Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, which was dedicated in September 1912, the jubilee year of the diocese. In 1951 the western part of the Diocese of Wichita was split off and a new Diocese of Dodge City was formed, which left the Diocese of Wichita with its present boundaries.

In addition, parishes and dioceses across the United States travel to Wichita to study the success of the diocesan Catholic schools. The diocese has four Catholic high schools, commonly known as secondary schools. Three of the schools are wholly controlled by the diocese; one is a parochial high school. All are supported chiefly through the stewardship of the parishioners. Three of the four high school facilities have been expanded in the last seven years.

Patrick Arena was the main sports arena located in the Greater Victoria, British Columbia, area. The wood constructed arena was located in the suburb municipality of Oak Bay, on the north east corner of Cadboro Bay Road and Epworth Street (then called Empress Street). Built in 1911 at a cost of $110,000 with a capacity for 4,000 spectators, it officially opened with public skating on December 25, 1911. More than 600 skaters enjoyed the thrill of opening day. The owners, Frank and Lester Patrick, built the arena primarily to accommodate their hockey team in the newly formed Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA).  Professional hockey  The first professional hockey game played at the Patrick Arena was between the New Westminster Royals and the hometown Victoria Senators on January 2, 1912. This was likely the first professional game on artificial ice in Canada.The first professional game of ice hockey on artificial ice was likely in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which had artificial ice at the Duquesne Gardens in 1896 and professional teams starting in 1901. See Western Pennsylvania Hockey League. In 1913 the Victoria Senators were renamed as the Victoria Aristocrats. In 1916 the Patrick Arena was commandeered by the Canadian military and the hockey team was forced to move to Spokane, Washington, to play as the Spokane Canaries. When the military left, a new team was formed in 1918 and again was dubbed the Aristocrats. In 1923 they changed their name to the Victoria Cougars and when the PCHA disbanded in 1924 they moved to the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). The 1925 Stanley Cup Finals saw the Western Canada Hockey League champion Victoria Cougars defeat the National Hockey League (NHL) champion Montreal Canadiens 3 games to 1 in the best-of-five game series. Games one, three and four were played at the Patrick Arena. The next year the Western Canada Hockey League was renamed as the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Victoria Cougars winning the league championship again. In Victoria's second Stanley Cup Final the Montreal Maroons were too strong, out scoring Victoria 10 to 3 and handily beating them three games to one at the newly built Montreal Forum. The Western Hockey League folded following the 1925‚Äì26 season and the new Detroit NHL franchise purchased the Victoria Cougars players and played as the Detroit Cougars until 1930. The next professional hockey team in Victoria was the Pacific Coast Hockey League's (PCHL) Victoria Cubs who began play in 1928. They were also scheduled to play in the 1929‚Äì1930 season but a fire destroyed the Patrick Arena on November 11, 1929, and the team played that season as a \\"road team.\\" Their 18 scheduled home games were played on the road, divided between Vancouver and Seattle.The Calgary Herald, November 14, 1929, page 7 After the team moved to Tacoma, Washington and became the Tacoma Tigers in 1930, Greater Victoria was without pro hockey until 1949, when a new version of the Victoria Cougars joined a new version of the PCHL in the new Victoria Memorial Arena.  Fire  The arena was destroyed by a fire in the pre-dawn hours of November 11, 1929; it was believed to be deliberately set.  Now  In 2001 a cairn commemorating the 1925 Stanley Cup victory by the Victoria Cougars was erected on Cadboro Bay Road in front of Oak Bay High School, right across the street from the old site of the Patrick Arena.

It involves an Apache helicopter set on defeating an evil Middle Eastern dictator. There are seven levels which feature six countries. Some of the levels involve switching altitudes in order to attack enemies from a different height, which uses Mode 7, one of the main features of the Super NES. Gameplay The main menu splits the game up into three sections; \\"Game Start,\\" \\"Shooting Mode,\\" and \\"Exploration Mode.\\" Game Start plays through all of the game's seven levels. Shooting Mode plays only the first, third, and fifth levels where consistent shooting and dodging enemy fire is the main focus. These levels are also the only levels that feature the ability to gain bullet and missile power-ups to the helicopter. \\"Exploration Mode\\" plays only the second, fourth, and sixth levels which involve switching altitudes to shoot down certain enemies and avoid obstacles. Only the Game Start mode plays the seventh and final level in addition to the game's first six levels. Gameplay involves being the pilot of an Apache Helicopter, and shooting enemies down in the style of a vertical scrolling shooter. Large red gunships can be shot down to gain power-ups for the helicopter in order to upgrade the guns and have it fire homing missiles. Each level features a midboss and a boss, and both must be destroyed in order to advance to the next level. The style of the levels as the player advances alternates between \\"Shooting Mode\\" and \\"Exploration Mode,\\" where the latter involves levels set in a fantasy-like setting and are the only level types that provide no power-ups to the player and give the player the ability to switch their altitude.

Height 32.7 cm, V&A; Museum. Plymouth porcelain was the first English hard paste porcelain, made in the county of Devon from 1768 to 1770. After two years in Plymouth the factory moved to Bristol in 1770, where it operated until 1781, when it was sold and moved to Staffordshire as the nucleus of New Hall porcelain, which operated until 1835. The Plymouth factory was founded by William Cookworthy.Honey, 1-5, Chapter 14; Cookworthy's Plymouth and Bristol Porcelain by F. Severne Mackenna (1947) published by F.Lewis and William Cookworthy 1705-1780: a study of the pioneer of true porcelain manufacture in England by John Penderill-Church, Truro, Bradford Barton (1972). The porcelain factories at Plymouth and Bristol were among the earliest English manufacturers of porcelain, and the first to produce the hard-paste porcelain produced in China and the German factories led by Meissen porcelain.Honey, 1-5 The term Bristol porcelain can refer either to this, the Cookworthy factory, or to \\"Lund's Bristol\\" or \\"Lund & Miller\\", an entirely different porcelain factory that made soft-paste porcelain in Bristol from 1750 until 1752, when it merged with the young Worcester porcelain (see there for more information), and moved there.Honey, 211-216 The Plymouth factory was removed to Bristol in 1770 and was afterwards transferred to Richard Champion of Bristol, a merchant who had been a shareholder from 1768. Champion's Bristol factory lasted from 1774 to 1781, when the business was sold to a number of Staffordshire potters owing to serious losses it had accrued. Bristol porcelain, like that of Plymouth, was a hard-paste porcelain. It is harder and whiter than the other 18th-century English soft-paste porcelains, and its cold, harsh, glittering glaze marks it off at once from the wares of Bow, Chelsea, Worcester or Derby. The Plymouth pieces show technical teething troubles. There are various technical faults with many pieces, and according to legend Cookworthy painted one early mug himself, and another piece was chipped in manufacture but still thought worth painting.Honey, 336-342 Some pieces use Longton Hall models; possibly Cookworthy bought the moulds in London. The modellers are unclear, though some figures are very fine, including the set of the continents (\\"Europe\\" illustrated). One modeller seems also to have worked at Derby.Honey, 342-345 History Covered butter pot, c. 1770, William Cookworthy & Co., Bristol (or possibly Plymouth), England, hard-paste porcelain, overglaze enamels William Cookworthy, a Quaker Pharmacist of Plymouth, was greatly interested in locating in Cornwall and Devon minerals similar to those described by P√®re Fran√ßois Xavier d'Entrecolles, a Jesuit missionary who worked in China during the early eighteenth century, as forming the basis of Chinese porcelain. P√®re d'Entrecolles provided an account in two letters, the first written in 1712 and the second written in 1722, of porcelain manufacture at the town of Jingdezhen that included a detailed description of the two principal materials used to make porcelain, china clay and Chinese pottery stone. After many years of travel and research William Cookworthy determined that Cornish china stone could be made to serve as equivalents to the Chinese materials and in 1768 he founded a works at Plymouth for the production of a porcelain similar to the Chinese from these native materials. In 1768 Cookworthy took out a patent for the exploitation of these Cornish materials in the manufacture of porcelain. The company began with 14 shares of ¬£15 or ¬£20 each, three held by Cookworthy, and the others one each by a group of his relatives and \\"prominent Bristol men\\", including Richard Champion of Bristol. More capital was needed later, and the company seems to have been loss-making.Honey, 333 Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, who owned the Cornish lands where the materials were sourced, took an interest in the company,Honey, 334 whose success was naturally in his interest. The wares of Plymouth and the first years at Bristol are not easily distinguished, and many prefer to classify pieces as \\"Cookworthy\\" or \\"Champion\\".Honey, 336 Bristol The factory was removed to Bristol in 1770 and was afterwards transferred to Richard Champion, a merchant already a shareholder. The patent was sold to Champion in 1773. An application to extend it was opposed by Wedgwood and other pottery companies, and mostly refused, so it expired in 1782 at the end of the original term, though Champion was granted rights for 14 years for the use of Cornish materials to make translucent porcelain. In the end he sold his rights in 1781 to the Staffordshire company that started New Hall porcelain in 1782, including New Hall.Honey, 335 In the end the English invention of bone china was to prove the most satisfactory material, and the great majority of English porcelain had moved to that by 1820.Honey, 4-5 Marks Factory marks are of only limited help, as many pieces are unmarked, and the main mark was also used at Bristol; this was 20px in underglaze blue, the alchemical symbol for tin, also used for the planet Jupiter.

The plan of Operation Zahnarzt was to immediately come after Operation Nordwind. The plan was to initiate a pincer movement to encircle and destroy the 3rd US Army. Overview This German offensive began in the immediate aftermath of Operation Nordwind. The intention of the operation was to trap and destroy Lieutenant General George S. Patton's US 3rd Army. Preliminary and small-scale attacks began shortly before and during Operation Nordwind which began on January 1, 1945. In the days that followed the Germans saw their small advances continually eroded by repeated counterstrikes from Major General Robert L. Spragin's US 44th Infantry Division, Major General Withers A. Burress'US 100th Infantry Division, and Major General Lewis E. Hibbs' US 63rd Infantry Division. They were supported by the French 2nd Armored Division. Allied artillery and air attacks (when the weather broke), together with the harshness of the weather, also diminished the momentum of the Germans by cutting off its already thin supply lines. Thus the Germans were forced to call off the operation on January 4. Zahnarzt was one of the last planned major offensives by the Germans during World War II. The First and Second SS Panzer Korps were involved in the Operation, and lost approximately 30 percent of their strength due to American artillery and constant air raids. General Manstein was recalled by Adolf Hitler to command the operation, yet it still failed.

It was founded on July 14, 1978, and comprises San Bernardino and Riverside counties. The Diocese of San Bernardino used to be part of the Diocese of San Diego. The diocese has 91 parishes, 7 missions and 5 chapels in its territory, and it is considered a home mission diocese; its cathedral is Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino. The diocese has become well known as one of the leaders among Catholic dioceses in implementing the Parish Coordinator model of parish leadership. Demographics In 2019 the Diocese claimed that there were 1,740,655 Catholics in its territory, a reported 22,000 increase from the previous year. If the numbers are correct it would make San Bernardino the fifth largest Catholic diocese in terms of population in the United States. The main cause of this increase is thought to be the increasing migration of Hispanics to the area in part due to the economic opportunities and affordable housing in comparison to the rest of California.

Plot summary In the book a sentient and powerful asteroid arrives in the solar system's asteroid belt after countless aeons of wandering interstellar space. Passing by another asteroid, the living asteroid makes its first ever encounter with other living beings - a likeable criminal involved in a life-and-death struggle with a corrupt and power-mad judge. The judge is eventually killed, but so too is his beautiful wife who had allied herself with the criminal, the couple falling in love. Whilst the god-like living asteroid builds a new world around itself, and blocks all mankind's efforts to investigate it, eventually the criminal returns to the planet with a small group. The sentient asteroid allows them to make planetfall, but only the criminal can accept living in the new Eden created for him, and they eventually depart. The alien then resurrects the late judge's wife. Reception Floyd C.

Biography Cantus is a full-time, professional vocal chamber ensemble, made up of eight men singing in a TTBB (tenor, tenor, baritone, bass), changed male voice arrangement. The artists are self-led, with programming and musical direction coming from within the group itself. The ensemble is known for innovative concert programming, often tying together works of numerous genres to explore a selected narrative, including classical music, orchestral-vocal repertoire, folk music, art song, popular songs, spirituals, and newly commissioned works. The vocal group maintains a schedule of around 70 live concert performances and 30-40 education/outreach activities in a given season, both in the United States of America and abroad. Cantus is an active proponent of music education, encouraging people of all ages - especially men - to sing. The ensemble has worked with tens of thousands of singers throughout the country in educational activities ranging from master classes to festivals and collaborations. New members are acquired through annual national auditions. The ensemble began as a student-run organization at St. Olaf College in 1995. After a successful northeast tour in the summer of 1998, Cantus transitioned into a professional ensemble and non-profit organization by 1999, based out of Minneapolis, MN. Notability Cantus is the only artist-led full-time vocal ensemble in the United States, and is one of two professional classical male vocal ensembles in the United States that pays its artists full-time salaries, while maintaining a year-round schedule of performances, the other being San Francisco's Chanticleer. The ensemble received the 2009 Chorus America Margaret Hillis Award, the first collaborative ensemble to do so. The ensemble's regular work with students nationwide also garnered Chorus America's Education Outreach Award in 2011. Cantus was selected by Minnesota Public Radio to be Artists in Residence for the 2010‚Äì11 season. The residency included supported touring, radio co- hosting, and international broadcasts via Performance Today.

He reported for The Washington Post until the end of 2015. He has won several prizes including a Polk Award in 1977, a television Emmy in 1981, and shared a 2002 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting with five other Washington Post reporters, and the 2010 Arthur Ross Media Award from the American Academy for Diplomacy. Since 2003, he has taught at Stanford University's Stanford in Washington program. Biography Pincus was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Jewish parents Jonas Pincus and Clare Glassman. He attended South Side High School, Rockville Centre, New York and graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in 1954. Before being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1955, where he served in the Counterintelligence Corps in Washington, D.C. from 1955‚Äì1957, he worked as a copy-boy for The New York Times. Pincus also attended Georgetown University Law Center, graduating in 2001 with a Juris Doctor degree. In September 1954 he married Betty Meskin, with whom he has a son. In May 1965, he married his second wife Ann Witsell Terry, who is from Little Rock, Arkansas, with whom he has one daughter and two sons. Career After his discharge from the Army, Pincus worked at the copy desk of the Wall Street Journal's Washington edition, leaving in 1959 to become Washington correspondent for three North Carolina newspapers. In an 18-month sabbatical he took in 1962, he directed his first of two investigations for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under J. William Fulbright. The investigations into foreign government lobbying led to a revision of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In 1963, he joined the Washington Star, and in 1966 he moved to the Washington Post, where he worked till 1969. In 1969 till 1970 he directed another investigation for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, looking into U.S. military and security commitments abroad and their effect on U.S. foreign policy, which eventually led to the McGovern- Hatfield amendment to end the Vietnam War. In 1973 Pincus tried to establish a newspaper, aiming at university towns with bad local newspapers, but without success. Believing that he would later buy the magazine, he had become executive editor of The New Republic in 1972, where he covered the Watergate Senate hearings, the House impeachment hearings of Richard Nixon and the Watergate trial. In 1975, after he was fired from the New Republic, he went to work as consultant to NBC News and later CBS News, developing, writing or producing television segments for network evening news, magazine shows and hour documentaries, and joined the Washington Post the same year. At the Washington Post, Pincus reports on intelligence, defense and foreign policy. He has written about a variety of news subjects ranging from nuclear weapons and arms control to political campaigns to the American hostages in Iran to investigations of Congress and the Executive Branch. For six years he covered the Iran-contra affair. He covered the intelligence community and its problems arising out of the case of confessed spy Aldrich Ames, allegations of Chinese espionage at the nuclear weapons laboratories. Pincus attended Georgetown Law School part-time beginning in 1995 and graduated in 2001, at the age of sixty- eight. He has been a visiting lecturer at Yale University and since 2002 has taught a seminar at Stanford University's Stanford-in-Washington program. Involvement in the Plame affair In October 2003, Pincus cowrote a story for the Washington Post which described a July 12, 2003 conversation between an unnamed administration official and an unnamed Washington Post reporter. The official told the reporter that Iraq war critic Joe Wilson's wife Valerie Plame worked for the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) nonproliferation division, and suggested that Plame had recommended her husband to investigate reports that Iraq's government had tried to buy uranium in Niger. It later became clear that Pincus himself was the Post reporter in question. Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald issued a grand jury subpoena to Pincus on August 9, 2004, in an attempt to discover the identity of Pincus' secret informant. On August 20, 2004, the Post filed a motion to quash the subpoena, but after Pincus' source came forward to speak with investigators, Pincus gave a deposition to Fitzgerald on September 15, 2004; he recounted the 2003 conversation to Fitzgerald but still did not name the administration official. In a public statement afterward, Pincus said that the special prosecutor had dropped his demand that Pincus reveal his source. On February 12, 2007, Pincus testified in court that it was then White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, swerving off topic during an interview, who had told him of Plame's identity. Pincus was interviewed about his involvement in the Plame affair, and his refusal to identify his source, in the first episode of Frontline's \\"News War\\". Criticism Pincus has been criticised by other journalists, including colleagues at the Washington Post, for factual inaccuracies in his reporting and in particular for failing to adequately address inaccuracies, even in cases where he has seemingly acknowledged the errors himself. In July 2013 Pincus wrote a highly speculative article about National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden prompting Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald (himself a subject of the article) to write an open letter to Pincus regarding what he described as \\"blatant, easily demonstrated falsehoods\\" including: > 1) Pincus stated that I wrote an article about Poitras \\"for the WikiLeaks > Press's blog\\" (I never wrote anything for that blog in my life; the article > he referenced was written for Salon); 2) Pincus claimed Assange \\"previewed\\" > my first NSA scoop in a Democracy Now interview a week earlier by > referencing the bulk collection of telephone calls (Assange was expressly > talking about a widely reported Bush program from 8 years earlier, not the > FISA court order under Obama I reported); 3) Pincus strongly implied that > Snowden had worked for the NSA for less than 3 months by the time he showed > up in Hong Kong with thousands of documents when, in fact, he had worked at > the NSA continuously for 4 years.\\" Greenwald and others noted that Pincus also failed to follow standard journalistic best practice in not approaching him for comment or to fact-check his allegations which led his own colleague at the Washington Post to speculate that \\"Pincus was sticking up for his killer sources in the national security community\\" - something Pincus denied despite his widely known ties to and background in the military and intelligence communities. Following sustained pressure from Greenwald and others the Washington Post eventually published a lengthy correction to the article. When unionized Washington Post reporters in The Newspaper Guild withheld bylines to protest a company contract offer, Pincus refused to join his fellow reporters and allowed his byline to be published. Honors and awards Pincus has won several newspaper prizes including the 1961 Page One award for magazine reporting in The Reporter, the George Polk Award in 1977 for stories in the Washington Post exposing the neutron warhead, a television Emmy for writing on the 1981 CBS News documentary series, \\"Defense of the United States\\", and in 1999 he was awarded the first Stewart Alsop Award given by the Association of Foreign Intelligence Officers for his coverage of national security affairs. In 2002 he was one of six Washington Post reporters who won a Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, and in 2010 the Arthur Ross Media Award from the American Academy for Diplomacy.

Structure In humans and apes it is trochleariform (or trochleiform), as opposed to cylindrical in most monkeys and conical in some prosimians.Bernard F. Morrey, Joaquin Sanchez-Sotelo (2009) The Elbow and Its Disorders p.4 It presents a deep depression between two well-marked borders; it is convex from before backward, concave from side to side, and occupies the anterior, lower, and posterior parts of the extremity. Trochlea of Humerus The trochlea has the capitulum located on its lateral side and the medial epicondyle on its medial. It is directly inferior to the coronoid fossa anteriorly and to the olecranon fossa posteriorly. In humans, these two fossae, the most prominent in the humerus, are occasionally transformed into a hole, the supratrochlear foramen, which is regularly present in, for example, dogs. Carrying angle When viewed from in front or behind, the trochlea looks roughly cylindrical, but when viewed from below its true oblique shape and the spiralling nature of its groove become apparent. The spiralling nature of the trochlear groove results in the varying transverse axes of the elbow joint. Most frequently, the groove is vertical on the anterior side but runs down laterally on the posterior side. During elbow flexion, the vertical anterior part of the trochlea keeps the upper arm and forearm aligned (when viewed in front). During elbow extension, however, the oblique posterior part makes contact with the trochlear notch on the ulna so that this obliquity forces the main axis of the forearm to form a small angle with that of the upper arm. This angle is known as the carrying angle and is more prominent in women than in men. Less frequently, the anterior part is oblique too, but in the opposite direction of the posterior side. Consequently, during full elbow flexion, the hand tends to rest outside the shoulder. Very rarely, the anterior part is oblique in the opposite direction, resulting in the hand's resting on the chest during flexion. Function The trochlea articulated with the trochlear notch The elbow is a hinge joint with a rotatory component where the trochlea forms the convex, proximal surface which articulates with the concave, distal surface on the ulna, the trochlear notch. While the trochlea together with its associated fossae almost covers a 360¬∞ angle, the trochlear notch on the ulna forms a 190¬∞ arc and the gap in between allows flexion and extension at the elbow. Maximum elbow flexion and extension is made possible because the two fossae accommodates to coronoid and olecranon processes. Ossification While the ossification of the capitulum has started a year after birth, the ossification of the trochlea begins at 8‚Äì9 years of age; that of the head of radius and the medial epicondyle at 4‚Äì5 years and that of the lateral condyle at 10 years.

She had four husbands and many lovers, including King Ludwig I of Bavaria and his son King Otto of Greece, Bohemian nobleman and Austrian statesman Prince Felix zu Schwarzenberg, and the Greek general Christodoulos Hatzipetros. She died in Damascus, Syria, as the wife of Arab Sheikh Medjuel el Mezrab, who was 20 years her junior.  Life  Jane Elizabeth Digby was born in Holkham Hall, Norfolk, on 3 April 1807,Mary S. Lovell, A Scandalous Life, p. 1. daughter of Admiral Henry Digby and Lady Jane Elizabeth Coke. Jane's father seized the Spanish treasure ship Santa Br√≠gida in the action of 16 October 1799 and his share of the prize money established the family fortune. Holkham Hall was the family seat of her maternal grandfather Thomas Coke and in 1815 her father inherited and settled in Minterne House and estate, Dorset.  Marriages, scandal, and affairs  Considered promiscuous for her times, Digby was first married to Edward Law, 2nd Baron Ellenborough (later Earl of Ellenborough), who became Governor General of India, on 15 October 1824. They had one son, Arthur Dudley Law (15 February 1828 ‚Äì 1 February 1830), who died in infancy. After successive affairs with her maternal cousin Colonel George Anson and Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, she was divorced from Lord Ellenborough in 1830 by an act of Parliament. This caused considerable scandal at the time. Digby had two children with Felix; Mathilde \\"Didi\\" (born 12 November 1829 Basel, Switzerland and raised by Felix's sister) and Felix (born December 1830 Paris, France) who died just a few weeks after his birth. The affair with Felix ended shortly after the death of their son. She then moved on to Germany and became the lover of Ludwig I of Bavaria. In Munich, she met Baron Karl von Venningen (6 January 1806 ‚Äì 10 June 1874). They married in November 1833 and had a son, Heribert (27 January 1833 Palermo, Italy ‚Äì 1885 Munich, Germany), and a daughter, Bertha (4 September 1834 Mannheim, Germany ‚Äì 22 September 1907). In 1838, Digby found a new lover in the Greek Count Spyridon Theotokis (born 1805). Venningen found out and challenged Theotokis to a duel, in which the latter was wounded. Venningen released Digby from their marriage and took care of their children. They remained friends for the rest of their lives. Though she was not legally divorced from Venningen until 1842, Digby converted to the Greek Orthodox faith and married Theotokis in Marseille, France in 1841. The couple moved to Greece with their son Leonidas (21 March 1840 Paris, France ‚Äì 1846 Bagni di Lucca, Italy). In 1846, after their son's fatal fall off a balcony, Theotokis and Digby divorced. Greece's King Otto became her next lover. Subsequently came an affair with a hero of the Greek War of Independence, the Thessalian general Christodoulos Chatzipetros,[ ŒìŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒöŒ±ŒπœÅŒøœÜœçŒªŒªŒ±œÇ: ¬´Œó ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒøŒπ ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ±ŒØŒøŒπ¬ª (1834‚Äì1934), œÑœåŒºŒøœÇ œÄœÅœéœÑŒøœÇ, œÉŒµŒª. 46‚Äì47, Œ≥ŒÑ Œ≠Œ∫Œ¥ŒøœÉŒ∑, ŒïŒ∫Œ¥œåœÉŒµŒπœÇ Œ¶ŒπŒªŒπœÄœÄœåœÑŒ∑, ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±, 1983.] acting as 'queen' of his army, living in caves, riding horses and hunting in the mountains. She walked out on him when he was unfaithful. Life in Syria Jane Digby, Lady Ellenborough (William Charles Ross) At age 46, Digby travelled to the Middle East and fell in love with Sheik Medjuel el Mezrab. The sheik's name has also been spelled as \\"Mijwal al Mezrab\\"Walter Phelps Dodge. The Real Sir Richard Burton. T. Fisher Unwin, London, 1907. Page 75. and as \\"Mijwal al-Musrab\\". Twentieth- century sourcesFor example, Stella Margetson in Leisure and Pleasure in the 19th Century (1969), page 138. sometimes incorrectly report it as \\"Abdul Medjuel el Mezrab\\". Medjuel was a sheik of the Mezrab section of the Sba'a, a sub-tribe of \\"the great Anizzah tribe of Syria\\".\\"Going down the history lane - II\\", blog post by Ahmad Alsarraf, kalamanas.com, 2017-04-19. (This might be a circular reference to Wikipedia.) He was 20 years her junior.Mary S. Lovell, A Scandalous Life, p. 173 The two were married under Muslim law and she took the name Jane Elizabeth Digby el Mezrab. Their marriage was a happy one and lasted until her death 28 years later. It has been written that Jane Digby was referred to as Shaikhah Umm al-Laban (literally sheikha mother of milk) due to the colour of her skin. Digby adopted Arab dress and learned Arabic in addition to the other eight languages in which she was fluent. Half of each year was spent in the nomadic style, living in goat-hair tents in the desert, while the rest was enjoyed in a palatial villa that she had built in Damascus. She spent the rest of her life in the city, where she befriended Sir Richard Burton and Lady Isabel Burton while the former was serving as the British consul, and Abd al-Kader al-Jazairi, a prominent exiled leader of the Algerian revolution.  Death  Digby died of fever and dysenteryMary S. Lovell, A Scandalous Life, p. 236. in Damascus on 11 August 1881, and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery. She was buried with her horse in attendance at the funeral. Upon her footstone‚Äîa block of pink limestone from Palmyra‚Äîis her name, written in Arabic by Medjuel in charcoal and carved into the stone by a local mason.Mary S. Lovell, A Scandalous Life, p. 326. After her death her house was rented and the family of the young H. R. P. Dickson were among its tenants. A small part of the house survives, and is in the ownership of the same family who purchased it from Medjuel's son in the 1930s.

He is to date the last Republican elected mayor of Philadelphia. Political career Ascension to the office of Mayor Samuel first won election to city council in 1923. When in 1939 George Connell, then president of city council, became acting mayor upon the death of S. Davis Wilson, Samuel ascended to the position of president pro tempore. Upon the death in August 1941 of Mayor Robert Lamberton, however, Samuel assumed the mayoralty for the remainder of Lamberton's term. Mayoral tenure Mayor Samuel proclaims City Defense Week, November 24, 1941 Samuel won re-election to the mayor's office in 1943 and 1947, defeating Democrats William Bullitt and Richardson Dilworth respectively, to become the first multi-term mayor since William Stokley, who served from 1872 through 1881. His mayoral tenure was the longest in Philadelphia's history. He supported the creation of a city sales tax and was instrumental in creating a city wage tax. In defending the political machine he served, Samuel prepared the city for reform by endorsing creation of Philadelphia's highly touted City Planning Commission and supporting 1947's Better Philadelphia Exhibition, which subjected the failures of a \\"corrupt and contented\\" Republican political machine to harsh scrutiny and made the elections of 1949 and 1951 for city controller and mayor, respectively, landmarks in the city's political history. 1944 transit strike Samuel took an active role in trying to quell the 1944 transit strike that beset the city. He closed all alcohol-selling establishments, and Governor Edward Martin followed suit and closed the state liquor stores in the area.Winkler, p. 82 The city deployed its full police force, with extra police officers posted at major intersections and other vital points. The NAACP, as well as other black civic groups, worked energetically to maintain calm among the black people of Philadelphia. They distributed more than 100,000 posters in black sections of the city, which read \\"Keep Your Heads and Your Tempers! ... Treat other people as you would be treated\\".Ross, pp. 97‚Äì98 The six-day strike was triggered by the decision of the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), made under prolonged pressure from the federal government in view of significant labor shortages, to allow black employees of the PTC to hold non-menial jobs, such as motormen and conductors, that were previously reserved for white workers only.

The song first appeared on their self-titled independent cassette release in 1992. It was re-recorded for their 1993 major-label debut album, Bargainville. Two live versions were also released on 1998's Live Noise. The song is essentially a modern re-telling of The Prince and the Pauper; it tells the story of a dethroned Spanish monarch, who, after switching places with an identical peasant friend, comes to Canada and gets a minimum wage job at Pizza Pizza. He also mentions working as a turf vacuumer at SkyDome and a Zamboni driver at Maple Leaf Gardens (or Montreal Forum in the indie tape version). The song is narrated by the King, who, throughout the song, tells of the things he did as king and what he would do if he ran Canada. He also suggests that world leaders such as Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin should call him if they need help running their countries. While the song is mostly a cappella, there are some percussion instruments (such as conga and shaker) providing accompaniment. The band dubbed this style \\"quasi-a cappella\\". The lead vocal is performed by Dave Matheson (who wears a \\"King of Spain\\" hat while performing the song live), with Jian Ghomeshi, Mike Ford and Murray Foster performing backup. As with most of their other songs, the band is known to change it when performing it live. The song is faster and the first chorus is usually performed with no accompaniment, with the callbacks usually being changed to spoken improvisations. The spoken vocals in the second verse (\\"There's a roof overhead / and food on our plates\\") is usually improvised by Foster and Ghomeshi (examples: \\"There's a roof overhead / And poutine on my face!\\"; \\"There's a cone on your head / Bonita!\\"). The \\"Leafs call me up to drive the Zamboni\\" line is usually changed to represent a local sports team in the city they are performing in. The \\"some of you are probably wondering...\\" spoken section is usually extended. The end of the song is usually segued into the unreleased song \\"Green Eggs and Ham.\\" The band is also known to play a grunge version of the song (known as the \\"Cranky Monarch Version\\" or \\"Grunge of Spain\\"), which is featured on Live Noise. A video of the song was made in 1992, and features the band busking outside the Bloor Cinema with Matheson as the King. It also features an \\"audience\\" made up of local celebrities such as Ed Mirvish and Daniel Richler. The Johnstones, a Canadian ska band, often cover this song during their live shows.

On October 21, 1944, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Indianapolis was split into the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and the Diocese of Evansville. At the same time, all of Indiana split away from the Ecclesiastical Province of Cincinnati to form the new Ecclesiastical Province of Indianapolis.  Statistics and extent  The Diocese of Evansville includes all or part of 12 counties in Southwestern Indiana, (of note Harrison Township in Spencer County, the location of St. Meinrad Archabbey, is part of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.) As of 2014, it pastorally served 90,800 Catholics (17.8% of 510,626 total) in 69 parishes (grouped into 4 deaneries) and 4 missions with 71 priests (66 diocesan, 5 religious), 59 deacons, 234 lay religious (6 brothers, 228 sisters) and 10 seminarians. History Basilica of St. Francis Xavier (Old Cathedral), Vincennes The Diocese of Evansville was founded on October 21, 1944, at which time it included 5 deaneries (Evansville, Jasper, Vincennes, Princeton, and Washington), 63 parishes and missions, 49,737 Catholics, and 75 diocesan priests. Henry Grimmelsman, a priest of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and rector of the Pontifical College Josephinum in suburban Columbus, Ohio, was named the first bishop, and Assumption Church in downtown Evansville was named the cathedral. The diocese purchased the John Augustus Reitz Home from the Daughters of Isabella for use as the chancery and bishop's residence. The Catholic population of the diocese grew rapidly in the post-war years and 12 new parishes were founded between 1944 and 1962 among suburban areas of Evansville and Jasper and the small towns of Fort Branch and Bloomfield, while mission churches in New Harmony and Oakland City were elevated to parish status. The population growth necessitated the building of new schools as well, and three high schools in Evansville ‚Äì Mater Dei on the west side, Rex Mundi on the north side, and Magister Noster, a high school seminary ‚Äì were founded, along with high schools in Ferdinand, Loogootee, and Vincennes, and a college operated by the Sisters of St. Benedict in Ferdinand. Catholic social institutions also experienced growth with the founding of Memorial Hospital, sponsored by the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary, in Jasper, and the construction of a new facility on Evansville's east side for St. Mary's Medical Center, sponsored by the Daughters of Charity. In contrast to other areas of the diocese, the population of downtown Evansville was experiencing decline, and Assumption Cathedral was closed in 1965. The buildings were razed and the land sold for use in the construction of a new government complex (the federal building stands on the former Assumption site). Holy Trinity church, also downtown, and the home of the chancery since 1957, was named the pro- cathedral, or temporary cathedral. Although the church lost its status as cathedral, the old cathedra remains the most prominent feature within the oratory. 1965 also brought the retirement of Bishop Grimmelsman. Paul Leibold, an auxiliary bishop in Cincinnati, was appointed to lead the Evansville diocese. Bishop Leibold left the diocese just over three years later, though, when he was appointed archbishop of Cincinnati. Francis Shea of the Diocese of Knoxville was named Evansville's third bishop in 1969. A new mission church was opened in the growing town of Santa Claus in 1967, and in 1970, St. Francis Xavier church in Vincennes, the oldest parish in Indiana, was named a basilica. Although the two nursing homes in the diocese, St. John Home in Evansville and the Providence Home in Jasper, both built expanded facilities in the 1970s, the strong growth of diocesan institutions generally abated in that decade. The recently opened high schools in Ferdinand and Loogootee were sold to the local public school districts. Rex Mundi and Magister Noster High Schools in Evansville were closed; Rex Mundi was sold to Ivy Tech Community College, and the chancery moved from Holy Trinity church to the former Magister Noster building. St. Benedict College in Ferdinand was closed, and the high schools in Vincennes consolidated. In Sullivan County, two mission churches, St. Ann in Shelburn and Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Dugger, closed in 1978 and 1982, respectively. Bishop Shea retired in 1989, and Gerald Gettelfinger, the vicar general of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, was appointed the diocese's fourth bishop. Several parishes built new churches in the 1990s, and the mission in Santa Claus, the last in the diocese, became a parish. As the number of priests in the diocese began to decline and population shifted from rural areas to suburban areas, three rural parishes in Daviess County, St. Patrick in Corning, St. Mary in Barr Township, and St. Michael, north of Montgomery, were closed in 1997. St. Patrick and St. Mary became chapels, while St. Michael was razed. In 1999, Bishop Gettelfinger named St. Benedict, the largest church building in Evansville, as the new cathedral for the diocese, which had not had a permanent cathedral since Assumption was closed in 1965. Recognizing the influx of Latin American Catholics into the diocese, a Hispanic ministry center was opened in 2000. Although the number of priests continued to decrease, the diocese began to ordain several large classes of permanent deacons. In 2008, St. Mary and St. Simon parishes in Washington merged to become Our Lady of Hope Parish, and St. Mary church was closed and razed. Faced with a declining number of priests and demographic shifts, the diocese began a formal planning process beginning in 2009 to allocate resources for the future. A new high school, named for John Paul the Great, was opened in Jasper in 2009; however the school was closed at the end of the 2011/12 school year due to low enrollment. In 2011, Charles Thompson, the vicar general of the Archdiocese of Louisville was appointed the fifth bishop of the diocese, replacing the retiring Bishop Gettelfinger. On July 1, 2014, a decree from Bishop Thompson merged several parishes, since the population no longer demanded as many parishes as it did during the mid-20th century. At the same time, the Diocese returned to enforcing a long-waived rule that no priest may say Mass more than three times on Sunday (including the evening vigil on Saturday), meaning some churches in the newly merged parishes would have no Sunday Masses at all.

All SH lighting techniques involve replacing parts of standard lighting equations with spherical functions that have been projected into frequency space using the spherical harmonics as a basis. To take a simple example, a cube map used for environment mapping might be reduced to just nine SH coefficients if preserving high-frequency detail is not a concern.An Efficient Representation for Irradiance Environment Maps More intriguing techniques use SH to encode multiple functions‚Äîusually the global lighting environment and a per-vertex radiance transfer function. The generalized lighting equation involves, among other things, integrating the product of the incoming radiance and the BRDF over a sphere‚Äîsomething that is far too expensive for real-time rendering. But if the two functions are projected into SH coefficients, the integral of their product over the sphere is just the dot product of the two SH coefficient vectors. Generating the per- vertex transfer functions and projecting them to SH space is still an expensive process, but evaluating them is almost trivial. More to the point, they can be evaluated correctly even if the lighting environment changes in intensity or orientation. Even the most complex ray-traced radiosity algorithm can be rendered in real-time with dynamically changing lighting. SH lighting using preprocessed coefficients produces results that are beautiful but limited. Typically the lighting can change, or the lit mesh can be rotated, but the mesh can't be translated or deformed without requiring a new set of per-vertex coefficients. More recent techniques split the lighting equation into more parts and introduce techniques for updating SH components in real time.

Lindsay is the first wildlife hospital established in the United States, and a popular family museum in the San Francisco East Bay Area. Founded in Walnut Creek in 1955, the museum's programs \\"connect people with wildlife to inspire responsibility and respect for the world we share.\\" The museum features a number of California wildlife exhibits, natural history specimens, and a special theater offering a look into one of the hospital's many wildlife treatment rooms. The rehabilitation center‚Äîstill among the largest in the country‚Äîtreats more than 5,000 injured, sick, or orphaned wild animals each year. History Lindsay Wildlife Museum was founded in 1955 by Alexander Lindsay as the Diablo Junior Museum. It became the Alexander Lindsay Junior Museum in 1962 after Alexander Lindsay died at 44. In 1965 it moved to a water-pump house in Larkey Park in Walnut Creek. In 1970 the museum started the first formal wildlife rehabilitation program in the United States. In 1986 the City of Walnut Creek ended operations and the museum became an independently operated not-for-profit organization. The next year \\"Junior\\" was dropped from the title, making it the Lindsay Museum. In 1993 the museum moved to a newly built museum near the old pump house. Three years later the name was changed to Lindsay Wildlife Museum. In recent years, the museum has added a number of major new exhibits. Wildlife Hospital Behind the Scenes lets visitors watch a live veterinary procedure at the hospital through a large, one-way window. At Raptors visitors can soar virtually over Mount Diablo and measure their armspan against raptors' wingspans. At Hive Alive! and Hive to Honey~Honey Bees and Beekeepers at Work visitors can watch thousands of live bees and their queen and learn what jobs different bees do. In fall 2013, the museum opened the new exhibit The Burrow where visitors can go \\"underground\\" to discover the world of wildlife beneath their feet. The museum changed its name to Lindsay Wildlife Experience in 2015. Hospital A North American beaver returning to the wild after being successfully rehabilitated at Lindsay Wildlife Hospital The wildlife rehabilitation hospital at the museum receives more than 5,000 California native wild animal patients every year. The hospital is a pioneer in wildlife rehabilitation and many now-standard protocols across the country were developed here. Hospital staff and volunteers treat animals that have been poisoned, struck by automobiles, fallen from trees during trimming, and injured by other often human-related activities. They also care for orphaned young, both onsite and at the homes of specially trained volunteers. After being treated, an animal is released back into the wild. If it cannot be safely released, it may join the museum as a resident \\"animal ambassador\\". As many animals brought to the hospital are cat- caught, the museum strongly encourages visitors to keep their cats indoors. Animal ambassadors Penelope, Lindsay Wildlife Experience's resident North American porcupine Lindsay Wildlife Experience specializes in the care of animals unable to return to the wild. Of the 70 animals that call Lindsay Wildlife home, nearly all of them have a physical, psychological, or behavioral problem that would make them unable to survive in the wild. All of the animals that live at Lindsay Wildlife Experience serve as animal ambassadors and educate the public on conservation and natural history. Some animals are on view to the public; others live off-exhibit and are brought out for presentations, classes, tours, and private animal encounters.

It is a tributary of the Buffalo River, which empties into Lake Erie. Cazenovia Creek and its watershed are entirely within Erie County. Course Cazenovia Creek is formed from its two branches east of the Village of East Aurora and flows through the Towns of Aurora, Elma, West Seneca, and the City of Buffalo. It joins the Buffalo River in the South Buffalo neighborhood. The East Branch of Cazenovia Creek flows through the Village of East Aurora and has its sources in the Southtowns of Erie County, primarily in the towns of Colden, Wales, Holland, and Sardinia. The West Branch of Cazenovia Creek rises from sources in the towns of Colden, Concord, and Sardinia. History Cazenovia Creek is named after Theophilus Cazenove, an agent of the Holland Land Company. In 1897, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted drew up plans for a park near the south city line of Buffalo. A farm at that location was purchased in 1890, and Cazenovia Park, straddling Cazenovia Creek, was built at that location. The park is in the South Buffalo section of the city. Cazenovia Creek is known for its annual ice jams in the early spring when temperatures rise.  Fishing  Cazenovia Creek also has a wide variety of fish that run through its waters.

She was a member of the Ottonian dynasty. Her first husband was Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine. Her second husband was Louis IV of France. Contemporary sources describe her as a highly educated, intelligent and forceful political player. Life Family Gerberga was born c.913. She was the second daughter of Henry the Fowler, King of Germany, and his second wife, Matilda (after Hedwig of Saxony, 3 years her senior). Her older brother was Otto I of Germany. First marriage In 929, Gerberga married her first husband, Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine.On Gerberga's marriage to Gilbert, and their children, see Glocker, Verwandten, pp. 28‚Äì33. They had four children: # Alberade of Lorraine b. about 929. Married Renaud (originally as Ragenold), a Viking chieftain who became the Count of Roucy. # Henry, Duke of Lorraine b. about 932 # Gerberge of Lorraine b. about 935. Married Adalbert I of Vermandois. # Wiltrude, b. about 937. Jocundus, a Lotharingia chronicler writing in the 1070s, recorded that Gerberga was the driving force behind Gilbert's decision to support her younger brother Henry when he rebelled against her older brother Otto I c.936.Jocundus, Translatio, pp. 123f., but Glocker, Verwandten, p. 32 argues against this view. Gilbert was defeated by Otto I in 939 at the Battle of Andernach and, while trying to escape, drowned in the Rhine. Second marriage When Gilbert died, Gerberga was about 26 years old. She married secondly Louis IV of France in 939. They were parents to eight children: # Lothair of France (941‚Äì986) # Matilda b. about 943; married Conrad of Burgundy # Hildegarde b. about 944 # Carloman b. about 945 # Louis b. about 948 # Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine (953‚Äì993) # Alberade b. before 953 # Henry b. about 953 Widowhood As regent Louis IV died on 10 September 954. At this time, his son and heir with Gerberga, Lothair of France, was only thirteen. Gerberga took action to ensure that Lothar could succeed his father. She reached an agreement with her brother-in-law Hugh the Great, who had been an adversary to Lothair's father.The Annals of Flodoard of Reims, 916‚Äì966, eds & trans. Steven Fanning: Bernard S. Bachrach (New York; Ontario, Can: University of Toronto Press, 2011), p. xix In exchange for supporting Lothair's rule Hugh was given rule over Aquitaine and much of Burgundy Gerberga did not seek the support of her brother, Emperor Otto I, because the interference of the East-Frankish emperor in West-Frankish affairs would have placed the West-Frankish kingdom in a weak position politically, and angered the West-Frankish nobles. After the death of Hugh the Great in 956, Gerberga and her sister Hadwig (who was Hugh's widow) were the heads of the two most powerful dynasties in West Francia. Along with their brother, Bruno, who was both archbishop of Cologne and duke of Lotharingia, Gerberga and Hadwig ruled the kingdom, until Lothair came of age.Glocker, Verwandten, esp. pp. 37‚Äì45. As abbess In 959, after Lothair had come of age, Gerberga became abbess of the Benedictine monastery of Notre Dame in Soissons. Nevertheless, she remained politically active. In 961 she was involved in choosing the new archbishop of Reims, Odalric. In 965 she was present at the imperial court in Cologne, when her son Lothair married Emma of Italy, the step-daughter of her brother Emperor Otto I. Death There is some debate about when Gerberga died.For an overview, see Glocker, Verwandten, p. 272. She is last documented in May 968. Since necrology records indicate that she died on 5 May, her date of death is often given as 968 or 969,Hlawitschka, 'Gerberga,' p. 256; Schwennicke, Europ√§ische Stammtafeln, table 10 The death date of 5 May 968 is not possible since Gerberga was still alive on 17 May 968 so her death date could only be in 969 or later some maintain that Gerberga did not die until 984.e.g. Thiele, Erz√§hlende genealogische Stammtafeln, table 11. She is buried in the Abbey of Saint-Remi in Reims, Champagne.

Early life Harris was born in Adelaide, South Australia, and raised in the city of Mount Gambier, where his father was based as a travelling salesman. His early poetry was published in the children's pages of The Sunday Mail. He continued to write poetry through his secondary schooling after winning a scholarship to St Peter's College, Adelaide. By the time he began attending the University of Adelaide, he was already known as a poet and intellectual. In 1941, he edited two editions of the student newspaper On Dit. Angry Penguins Harris's passion for poetry and modernism were driving forces behind the creation in 1940 of a literary journal called Angry Penguins. His co-founders were D.B. \\"Sam\\" Kerr, Paul G. Pfeiffer and Geoffrey Dutton. The first issue attracted the interest of Melbourne lawyer and arts patron John Reed, who offered to collaborate on publishing further issues. Harris, already trying to establish a South Australian branch of the Contemporary Art Society, was lured to the Reeds' art enclave at Heide. By the second issue of Angry Penguins, Harris had incorporated visual art into the journal. Sidney Nolan later joined the editorial team. Other artists associated with Angry Penguins include Albert Tucker, Joy Hester, James Gleeson, Arthur Boyd and John Perceval. Traditionalist poets were outraged by the success of Angry Penguins with its promotion of surrealism and publication of progressive writers such as Dylan Thomas, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, James Dickey and the American poet Harry Roskolenko. The poet and critic A. D. Hope was among those virulently opposed to Harris and the modernists. Hope inspired two young poets serving in the army, Harold Stewart and James McAuley, to \\"get Maxy\\". Under the name of \\"Ern Malley\\", the pair crafted a series of poems in the modernist style and submitted them to Harris at Angry Penguins. Harris thought the poems brilliant and published them with some fanfare in Angry Penguins. The poems were controversial but well received. However, police in South Australia interpreted some lines in the poetry as lewd (one poem used the word \\"incestuous\\") and Harris was charged with obscenity. Reed and Harris, who were by this time also publishing books, employed a detective to discover more about the mystery poet. Word emerged that Ern Malley was a hoax. The obscenity trial attracted international press attention. Harris was found guilty and fined five pounds despite noted literary critics testifying for the defence. Harris never wavered in his belief in the quality of the Ern Malley poems, which continue to be published and studied.Rainey, David. Ern Malley: The Hoax and Beyond. Melbourne: Heide Museum of Modern Art, 2009. , pp. 24‚Äì26. 'But I believed in Ern Malley. In all simplicity and faith I believed such a person existed, and I believed it for months before the newspapers threw their banner headlines at me.' Harris wrote this in the 1952 first issue of \\"Ern Malley's Journal\\" when reviewing Wolfgang Borchert's book \\"The Man Outside\\". Harris also said 'I was offered not only the poems of this mythical Ern Malley, but also his life, his ideas, his love, his disease, and his death ‚Ä¶ in Rookwood cemetery. Most of you probably don't think about the story of Ern Malley's life. It got lost in the explosive revelation of the hoax. ‚Ä¶ For me Ern Malley embodies the true sorrow and pathos of our time. One had felt that somewhere in the streets of every city was an Ern Malley ‚Ä¶ in Hamburg, Vienna, Rome, Cleveland, Bombay ‚Ä¶ a living person, alone, outside literary cliques, outside print, dying, outside humanity but of it.' Harris's words are perhaps the most poignant and compelling in all written about the hoax and its aftermath. Later life Harris ran the Mary Martin Bookshop in Adelaide with his university friend Mary Maydwell Martin. They published a monthly newsletter with literary criticism, comment and book reviews. After Mary Martin moved to India, Harris expanded the book chain across Australia and Hong Kong. The chain pioneered the remaindered book industry in Australia by offering quality titles at reasonable prices. Harris fought the stranglehold which overseas publishers had on the Australian book market, taking on major publishing houses to ensure accessibly-priced books for Australian readers. The Mary Martin chain was sold to Macmillans in the late 1970s.Samela Harris (2012): A life of books ‚Äì and Mary Martin's AdelaideNow, 2 September 2012. Accessed 5 February 2014. Harris founded and co-edited the Australian Book Review and another literary journal, Australian Letters, which continued the practice of commissioning artists to illustrate poetry. He was also, together with Geoffrey Dutton and Brian Stonier, a founder of Sun Books.C4: Sun Books, Re:collection, recollection.com.au. Retrieved 11 August 2019. Harris published his poetry privately, although it was often included in classic Australian anthologies. He became a long-serving and controversial columnist for The Australian, with many of his \\"Browsing\\" columns later published in book form. It was in this context that he was dubbed \\"Australia's Cultural Catalyst\\". He also wrote columns for Adelaide newspapers. Harris campaigned against censorship, and was an early voice in the Australian republican movement. Although he was not a Catholic, Harris championed the then little-known nun and teacher, Mary MacKillop, founder of the Josephite order, calling her \\"a saint for all Australians\\". He became a prominent lay spokesman for her canonisation. Josephite nuns visited Harris in later life when he was ill. His ashes lie in a park between the Mary MacKillop College and the Josephite Convent in Adelaide. A collection of his work was published posthumously by the National Library of Australia as The Angry Penguin. Harris was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. The Alumni Association of Adelaide University awarded him the title of \\"Father of Modernism in the Australian Arts\\". Personal life Harris was the father of journalist and columnist Samela Harris. Popular culture Richard Flanagan makes reference to Harris in his novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North.

Since 2002, the bishop is Roger Joseph Foys. The cathedral church of the diocese is the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption. History The diocese was founded on July 29, 1853, by Pope Pius IX. The president of Xavier University in Cincinnati, George Aloysius Carrell, S.J., was installed as its first bishop. The diocese originally consisted of the eastern half of Kentucky, with the Diocese of Louisville containing the western half. Historically, the Catholic population of the diocese was composed primarily of descendants of German immigrants to the towns of Covington and Newport in the mid-19th century, who came after the revolutions of 1848. The Catholic communities of Cincinnati and Louisville had a similar demographic. Much of the parish architecture in the diocese reflects this German cultural heritage. In 1988, the southern portion of the diocese was incorporated into the new Diocese of Lexington. Clergy sexual abuse reports and settlements In 2009, it was reported that 243 victims of clergy sexual abuse had received an average of $254,000 each, totaling approximately $79 million. Perpetrators included 35 priests. In November 2019, it was reported that when the 2009 settlement was finalized, it totaled $90.5 million.https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/these-priests-credibly- accused-of-child-sexual-abuse-still-live-quietly-in-the-tri-state In the early 21st century, the Roman Catholic Church in the United States was revealed to have covered up widespread sexual abuse of minors by priests that occurred in numerous dioceses; the scandal was first investigated in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2005 the Diocese of Covington announced that it had settled with more than 100 victims of sexual abuse by paying approximately $120 million.https://www.baltimoresun.com/bal- te.church04jun04-story.html#:~:text=COVINGTON%2C%20Ky.,alleged%20victims%20of%20child%20molestation. The diocese agreed that any person who claimed to have been sexually abused by a member of the clergy or a lay employee could seek compensation no matter how long ago alleged abuse occurred. Under terms of the settlement, victims would be placed into one of four categories, depending upon the severity of their abuse. Payments would range from $5,000 to $450,000 for each victim, minus attorneys' fees. This was the largest settlement for any Roman Catholic diocese in the United States at the time. The diocese acquired $40 million by liquidating real estate assets, including the Marydale Retreat Center in Erlanger, and other investments. The remaining $80 million was paid by its insurance carriers. Bishop Foys vowed to meet with every victim of abuse who was willing to meet saying, \\"Those harmed by these shameful, despicable deeds now need the institutional Church and, more importantly, the pastoral Church to provide as much comfort and peace as possible. Our hearts must remain open, like Christ's.\\" On July 31, 2020, the Diocese of Covington released a report on sexual abuse which found that 59 Catholic priests and 31 others associated with the church had sexually abused children since at least 1950. However, it was reported in November 2019 that 92 priests and brothers who served in the Diocese of Covington were accused of sexual abuse by not just the Vatican, but also prosecutors and civil litigation since 1959. Sex abuse arrest In August 2019, Rev. David Glockner was arrested after being accused of inappropriately touching two high school girls who were volunteering in a construction project at a farm project in Vanceburg.https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2019/08/08/diocese-covington- priest-accused-inappropriately-touching-girls/1959005001/ Shortly after his arrest, the Diocese removed Glockner from ministry at his parish. After being bailed out of jail, Glockner left the state of Kentucky and is required to live in Cincinnati, Ohio's Glenmary headquarters.

Princess is located along Kentucky Route 5, near the intersection of U.S. Route 60 and Kentucky Route 5 (GPS 38.387494,-82.745017). Princess ends at or near the top of Princess Hill (GPS 38.387343,-82.734724). Princess Hill is located on US 60 between the community of Princess and the unincorporated community of Cannonsburg. Princess runs southwest from Princess Hill along US 60 and ends when the unincorporated community of Coalton is encountered (GPS 38.381322,-82.749798). And Princess runs along Kentucky Route 5 to the confluence of Straight Creek and William's Creek (near the intersection of Kentucky Route 5 and Straight Creek Road - GPS 38.400427,-82.760516). The community is named after a late 19th-century iron furnace called \\"Princess\\", said to have been the pet name of a daughter of a furnace official. Initially the community may have been called \\"Princess Furnace\\". An imposing brown sandstone retaining wall of the Princess Furnace facility (GPS 38.394084,-82.758883) remains, but the actual Princess iron furnace was dismantled and relocated to Glen Wilton, Virginia (Botetourt County) in 1883‚Äì1884. This sandstone wall is located along Kentucky Route 5 approximately 0.98 miles from US 60 and just west of where Kentucky Route 5 crosses William's Creek. There is a Kentucky Historical marker (#1135) for Princess Furnace near the sandstone retaining wall along Kentucky Route 5. The actual furnace was very near this wall, since the furnace was loaded from its top with raw materials via a catwalk from the hill retained by the sandstone wall. The iron ore used in Princess Furnace was mined locally and shallow ore diggings gouged along the faces of the local hills are still visible. The population focus and activity of the community has steadily shifted to near the intersection of Kentucky Route 5 and US 60. Much of this shift can likely be attributed to the industrial brick factory (GPS 38.38244,-82.746195), now largely dismantled, near Kentucky Route 5 and US 60. This brickyard facility maintained many \\"company\\" houses near the facility for employees. A few of these company houses remained until the early 1990s, but all are now gone and the land is now privately owned. And most recently, there has been continued development of the subdivision \\"Princeland\\" (GPS 38.383668,-82.749993) and commercial / industrial developments at the Paul Coffey Industrial Park (GPS 38.39344,-82.739543); both are very near this KY 5 / US 60 intersection focus. A railroad runs parallel to US 60 in the Princess area with a tunnel that goes under Princess Hill. At one point this was a major rail line of the C & O running from Ashland, Kentucky to Louisville, Kentucky, but now it is only a spur line that terminates at the steel mill in Coalton, the unincorporated community adjacent to Princess. Princess is located within an Ashland postal zip code (41102). Princess is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).

This diocese covers most of East Tennessee; in addition to the see city of Knoxville, it includes Chattanooga and Johnson City. The Mother Church is the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, located on Northshore Drive in Knoxville. The two oldest churches are Saints Peter and Paul Basilica Parish of Chattanooga and Church of the Immaculate Conception Parish of Knoxville, both founded in 1852.

The diocese is currently home to 47 parishes and four missions. These parishes are served by 54 diocesan priests, 16 religious priests, 8 extern priests, 24 deacons, 10 brothers, and 33 sisters. Eleven religious institutes are represented in the diocese. Perpetual adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament is available at many of the parishes and Masses are celebrated in a wide array of languages. This is chosen so that the spiritual needs of all parishioners are met. These languages include English, Spanish, Vietnamese, American Sign Language, and Latin. With the influx of large numbers of Hispanic Catholics looking for work, the diocese faces many new challenges. If the estimates are correct and there are about 50,000 new Hispanic immigrants in the area, their number nearly doubles the area's current official Catholic population.

His 100 m butterfly triumph is particularly remembered for his swimming over 25 m of the first lap underwater and then 15 m in the opposite direction, also underwater. He trained at the Volgograd club with fellow individual gold medallist at Swimming World World Swimmer of the Year Yevgeny Sadovyi. Biography Pankratov was born in Volgograd, Soviet Union. At the age of 16, in 1990 and again in 1991, he won the Junior European Championships in the butterfly. In his first international appearance at senior level, he placed 6th in the final of the 200 m butterfly at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. In 1993, at the European Championships in Sheffield, Pankratov won his first international medals, with gold medals in the 200 m butterfly and 4√ó100 m medley relay and a silver medal in the 100 m butterfly. He repeated this performance in the 1995 European Championships in Vienna, this time winning all three gold medals and breaking Pablo Morales's nine-year-old 100 m butterfly world record with a time of 52.32. He held the 100 m butterfly world record for over two years, until it was broken by Michael Klim. At the 1994 World Championships in Rome, Pankratov swam head-to-head with all the best swimmers of the world. He won the 200 m butterfly, placed second in the 4√ó100 m medley relay and third in the 100 m butterfly. This competition established Pankratov as the leading butterflier in the world and two years later in Atlanta, at the 1996 Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals, one each in the 100 m and 200 m butterfly and a silver medal in the 4√ó100 m medley with his Russian teammates. His 100 m butterfly victory was another world record of 52.27 s, breaking his own record set the previous year. Uniquely, he won the 100 m butterfly by swimming more than 25 m of the first lap underwater and then 15 m in the opposite direction, also underwater.YouTube - Men's 100m Fly Finals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games His submarine technique caused a rule change to restrict butterfly swimmers to 15 m underwater (humans swim slower than the speed which they gain from diving and gliding and bouncing off the walls), in line with the other strokes. Pankratov attempted to repeat his success at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and finished 7th in the 200 m butterfly. He retired in 2002. In total, he set seven world records, three long course and four short course. His two long course 100 m butterfly world records stood for two years until broken in 1997, and his 200 m butterfly world record of 1:55.22 lasted five years before broken by Tom Malchow of the United States. His short course world records included two in the 100 m butterfly and one each in the 50 m and 200 m butterfly, set in 1997.

She was formally named by American politician Elizabeth Dole in Miami on April 27, 2001. Alt URL Areas of operation Carnival Spirit in Sydney 2013. Previously in the northern fall and winter seasons, Carnival Spirit sailed cruises from San Diego, California and Los Angeles, California to the Mexican Riviera. After Carnival Spirit's repositioning out of San Diego in April 2012, Carnival ceased operations with that port. During the period from mid-May and ending in September (northern summer), Carnival Spirit sailed the waters off Alaska, visiting several glaciers on alternating one-week northbound and southbound voyages calling at Vancouver and Seattle, Washington. In September 2012, Carnival Spirit sailed to the Hawaiian Islands. After Carnival Spirit finished her Alaskan and Hawaii cruises, she embarked on a Tahiti and Fiji cruise for repositioning to Australia, arriving on October 16. The ship is currently based in Sydney, Australia, and will continue for five years, making the first time that Carnival has based a ship permanently outside North America. Carnival Spirit was dry docked in San Francisco in January 2012 to prepare her for Australia, this included installing Australian-style power points as well as changing the on-board currency to the Australian dollar and regular renovations. The total cost of the renovations was US$7 million. Carnival Spirit commenced cruising from Sydney to the South Pacific, Fiji and New Zealand from October 20, 2012 In August 2015 Carnival Spirit went into drydock in Singapore for a $44 million refurbishment. In May 2016, Carnival announced that Carnival Spirit would sail seasonally in China from Shanghai. In late 2016, Carnival subsequently reversed this decision and Carnival Spirit continued to sail from Sydney throughout the year. Their reasoning was that the Australian market continued to be strong and that leaving Australia without a Carnival vessel over the Winter months would not be economically viable in the long term. In summer 2018, Carnival announced that Carnival Spirit would become the company's first ship to sail from Brisbane, Australia starting in 2020. Incidents and accidents  Couple fall overboard  On May 8, 2013, police in Australia were searching for a couple that surveillance video showed going over the railing the night before Carnival Spirit was scheduled to dock in Sydney. The couple was Paul Rossington, 30, and his 26-year-old girlfriend Kristen Schroder, both of Barraba, New South Wales, were on the cruise with seven family and friends. After two days the search was called off.  Crew member disappearance  An Indian kitchen hand was missing, presumed overboard, from the ship on July 8, 2014 as it travelled from Vanuatu towards Port Denarau, Fiji.  Severe weather  On Monday, April 20, 2015, a powerful east coast low stranded the ship in the Tasman Sea. The ship was hit by swells up to 9 metres. The passengers were stuck offshore for over 24 hours. One passenger said, ‚Äúthe side tables were falling over, the side cupboard were falling over and glasses, you could not let go of your cups\\".

In 1728, he transferred to the Navy and, by 1756, had become a captain, commanding one of the ships sent to Menorca under the direction of La Galissoni√®re. He later took part in action near Santo Domingo and the Antilles and was rewarded with a promotion to rear admiral in 1764.

D'Orvilliers was appointed Vice Admiral (Lieutenant- General of the Navy) and prepared to engage the Royal Navy in the Atlantic.Battle of Ushant (1778) His greatest success came in July 1778 during the First Battle of Ushant, when his fleet managed to fend off an attack from a similarly-sized English fleet led by Admiral Augustus Keppel. The following year, however, he led an unsuccessful attempt to raid the English ports of Portsmouth and Plymouth. Although the weather and crew sickness played a part, he was censured for not making better use of the forces under his command. As a consequence, he resigned his command.

Accidents and incidents  Fire On the afternoon of July 20, 1998, Ecstasy departed the Port of Miami, Florida, en route to Key West, Florida, with 2,565 passengers and 916 crew members aboard. A fire started in the main laundry room and spread through the ventilation system to the aft mooring deck, where mooring lines ignited. As Ecstasy was attempting to reach an anchorage north of the Miami sea buoy, the vessel lost power and began to drift. The master then radioed the U.S. Coast Guard for assistance. Six tugboats responded to help fight the fire and tow Ecstasy. The fire was brought under control by onboard firefighters and was extinguished about 9:09 PM. Fourteen crew members and eight passengers suffered minor injuries. One passenger required medical treatment as a result of a pre- existing condition and was categorized as a serious injury victim because of the length of her hospital stay. Losses from the fire and associated damages exceeded $17 million. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of fire aboard Ecstasy was the unauthorized welding by crew members in the main laundry that ignited a large accumulation of lint in the ventilation system and the failure of Carnival Cruise Lines to maintain the laundry exhaust ducts in a fire-safe condition. Contributing to the extensive fire damage on the ship was the lack of an automatic fire suppression system on the aft mooring deck and the lack of an automatic means of mitigating the spread of smoke and fire through the ventilation ducts. Passengers received a full refund and were offered a complimentary cruise for the inconvenience.  Suicide  On July 1, 2007, David Ritcheson, the victim of the April 22, 2006 Harris County, Texas assault incident, jumped off the deck of Carnival Ecstasy and died.

The game received very high rankings in video game magazines, but the publisher went out of business shortly after the game's release; the developer then sold the game exclusively from its website.  Plot  The development of the Hyperspace-Drive triggers a gold rush-like colonization attempt by Earth governments, only to find that habitable (the game takes these as Earth-like) planets are either homeworlds for other sapient species, or colonies of early- evolved species. Years of build-up and exploration bears fruit: A habitable, rich and lush world with no sentient race is found. However, almost every race intends to colonize it, and soon a full-scale Galactic war will erupt. To solve the bloodshed, the sapient races agree to a competition: Every race would dispatch a Rocket Ship with a pre-determined size, mass and equipment, stocked with materials, personnel and equipment to create a city analogous of modern Earth technology and infrastructure. Then without interruption from outer space, the base-cities would engage in conflict, with the victor being granted the ownership of the planet. Of course, it is your duty to ensure a new world for your species to claim. Development Stores pre-ordered above 100,000 copies of Enemy Nations by January 29, 1997. Reception According to its developer, sales of Enemy Nations surpassed 35,000 units by late 1998. Home of the Underdogs - 9/10. \\"Enemy Nations is one of the best and most sophisticated real-time strategy games ever made...It's neither a simple action strategy game, nor is it a straightforward god game with token battle elements. Rather, it's an isometric strategy game which takes influences from half a dozen existing games and tries to blend them into something new, and in most aspects, succeeds admirably.\\" Legal Dispute After the publisher Head Games went out of business, Windward Studios said Enemy Nations grossed more than $500,000, and hadn't paid Windward royalties. Windward took Head Games to arbitration and won. Activision acquired Head Games in the middle of the arbitration.

Discovery The remnants of Yuanmou Man were discovered on May 1, 1965, by the geologist Fang Qian, who was working for the Geological Mechanics Research Institute. Based on the palaeomagnetic dating of the rock they were found in, it was initially estimated that the fossils were about 1.7 Ma and thus represented the earliest fossils of human ancestors found in China and East Asia.

Nature. 459: 910-911. . This piece in Nature is based on a contribution to the forthcoming book Out of Africa I: Who, When and Where? (eds, Fleagle, J. G. et al. Springer, 2009) Dating The dating has been indirectly questioned by Geoffrey Pope who argued that evidence does not support the appearance of hominidae in Asia prior to 1 million years ago.Geoffrey G. Pope. Evidence on the Age of the Asian Hominidae Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (1983) 80:4988-92 (this skepticism has since lifted, with additional findings in the last 25 years). There are still, however, conflicting opinions regarding the age of the Yuanmou Fm. and Yuanmou Man. You et al. (1978) suggested that Member 4 in the upper part of the formation is middle Pleistocene and should be designated the Shangnabang Fm., while the sediments exposed at Shagou containing Enhydriodon cf. falconeri should be designated the Shagou Fm. with an age of Pliocene.Qian F, Li Q, Wu P, Yuan S, Xing R, Chen H, and Zhang H (1991). Lower Pleistocene, Yuanmou Formation: Quaternary Geology and Paleoanthropology of Yuanmou, Yunnan, China. Beijing: Science Press, pp. 17-50 Liu et al. (1983) believed the age of Yuanmou Man was Middle Pleistocene, did not exceed 0.73 Ma, and was probably contemporaneous with Peking Man. Subsequently, Qian (1985) conducted further studies of the age of Yuanmou Man, but still obtained an age of 1.7 Ma, or Early Pleistocene. These investigations initiated beneficial discussion, although further conflicting opinions persist regarding depositional environment, paleoclimatology, glaciation, and other aspects. According to Qian et al. (1991), palaeomagnetic dates from near where the teeth were recovered average 1.7 Ma. Older research by Liu and Ding (1984) noted that the faunal sequence at the site was inverted, with more extinct species in the upper levels than deeper in the deposit, and based on this evidence they suggest to put the age of the Yuanmou man into the Middle Pleistocene, that is about 0.5 - 0.6 Ma.Inverted strata References External links * ChinaCulture - Yuanmou Man Site * Yuanmou, website with pictures of remains * Human Timeline (Interactive) ‚Äì Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History (August 2016).

The Catholic population of the diocese is estimated at approximately 76,000 individuals registered in parishes, which represents about 3.4% of the overall population in Middle Tennessee. In 2016 Mass is offered in Spanish, Vietnamese, Latin, and Korean. The Diocese has 75 priests and 70 permanent deacons serving 53 parishes. There are 34 seminarians currently studying for the priesthood. The remnant Nashville diocese now encompasses roughly the counties in the Middle Grand Division of the state, with the majority of its membership living in Nashville and surrounding suburbs. However, some parishes outside that area have seen considerable growth in recent times due to the influx of Hispanic immigrants settling in some smaller communities; sometimes, the Spanish-speaking membership outnumbers the English-speaking communicants in such churches. Services are often said in English by one priest and then in Spanish by a second priest. It is common to have three or more services each weekend. A study released in 2014 by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) at Georgetown University cited the Diocese of Nashville as having the 8th highest rate of conversions to Catholicism. The cathedral of the diocese is the Cathedral of the Incarnation, located on West End Avenue in Nashville, close to the Vanderbilt University campus. St. Mary's Church, located in downtown, served as the diocese's cathedral until 1914. St. Mary's Church still stands to this day, and holds the remains of the first bishop.  Sexual abuse cases  The Diocese of Nashville has had a few sexual abuse scandals, several of which came to light in the early 2000s after the investigation of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. In 2003, allegations began to surface that Father Ryan High School principal Ronald Dickman had been forced to resign in 1987 due to reports of molesting two students. Mark Cunningham, a local Catholic businessman, reported that he had alerted Father Giacosa in 1991 that Mark Cunningham's late brother John Cunningham Jr., had been molested by Ronald Dickman. In 1991, Ronald Dickman left the priesthood, and in 1992 left his job as executive director of Nashville's Crisis Intervention Center after officials at the center received multiple reports that Ronald Dickman had molested children. In taped conversations between Mark Cunningham and Nashville Diocese attorney Gino Marchetti, Gino Marchetti refused to acknowledge that Ronald Dickman was removed from the priesthood due to the allegation of molestation but admitted: \\"Now you don't have to be a damn rocket scientist to figure out somebody who has been in the priesthood for, you know, whatever, 20 years - that, you know, somebody comes in August or September of '91 and then December 1, '91 he, quote, leaves the priesthood, unquote. ... I mean, like I said, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out.\\" After Mark Cunningham released recordings of his conversations to The Tennessean, Rick Mussachio (a spokesman for the Nashville Diocese) conceded in January 2003 that \\"Gino only acknowledged to Mark that a conversation between Mark and Father Giacosa took place in 1991 and that someone might draw a conclusion that there was a connection between that meeting with Giacosa and Dickman's departure from the priesthood. However, any inference that this conversation confirms an allegation of the sexual abuse of a minor is simply incorrect.\\" Another Father Ryan alumnus, David Brown, came forward in 2005 (when the Diocese of Nashville released victims from confidentiality agreements) with allegations that former biology teacher Rev. Paul Frederick Haas had molested children at Father Ryan in the 1960s before his transfer to Kentucky. Brown had initially alerted the Nashville Diocese in 1996, but the Nashville Diocese induced him to settle the case after Bishop Kmiec told him: \\"Yours is an isolated case... We don't know of any others.\\" In 2011, a controversy arose over the naming of the diocese's football stadium at Father Ryan High School after former teacher Father Charles Giacosa, who bequeathed approximately $1 million for the construction of the stadium. Father Ryan alumnus and local businessman Charles Michael Coode, who also claimed that he was abused by a former Father Ryan priest in 1953 before Father Giacosa's tenure, wrote letters to the Father Ryan Board of Trustees criticizing the decision to honor Father Giacosa. As detailed in an opinion of the Tennessee Supreme Court reversing a grant of summary judgment to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nashville, Father Giacosa and Bishop Niedergeses were aware in 1986 that Father McKeown \\"had sexual contact with approximately thirty boys over the past 14 years.\\" The Nashville Diocese sent Father McKeown to in-patient treatment at the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut, from October 1986-March 1987. Father Giacosa and Bishop Niedergeses transferred Father McKeown back to Nashville in the spring of 1987. \\"Although the Diocese putatively forbade McKeown's access to youth, ... McKeown heard children's confessions, participated openly in various Diocesan youth activities including overnight, 'lock-ins,\\" and spent time individually with minor boys with whom he had made contact through the Diocese... The record also indicates that Bishop Niedergeses and Father Giacosa became aware of some if not all of these activities no later than February 1989.\\" Father Giacosa and Bishop Niedergeses finally took action because, according to their notes from a meeting in 1988 with Father McKeown, they \\"worried about the Diocese being exposed in sensationalistic news television.\\" Father Giacosa's notes from that meeting were labeled \\"'Top Secrecy' 'Could hurt your church'\\" and indicated that \\"they wanted the Diocese to avoid financial liability for his sexual misconduct.\\" Father Giacosa and Bishop Niedergeses finally induced McKeown to depart from Diocese property in 1989 after McKeown presented a minor boy with a condom at a Christmas party, but the Diocese continued to pay McKeown until early 1994. According to the Tennessee Supreme Court, \\"[i]n 1995 Bishop Kmiec, Bishop Niedergeses' successor, became aware that a parent in Knoxville alleged that McKeown had molested her son several years earlier.\\" From 1995 to 1999 McKeown sexually abused two minor boys whom he often accompanied \\"on the sidelines during football games at a Diocesan high school.\\" Finally, after years of the Nashville Diocese's failure to report Father McKeown, he was convicted in 1999 after the two boys and their parents reported the abuse to the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department and eventually died in prison in 2018.https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/12/31/edward-mckeown- nashville-priest-rape-dies-prison/2450605002/ On February 28, 2020, the Diocese of Nashville unveiled the names of 25 Catholic clergy who were accused of committing acts of sex abuse while serving in the Diocese of Nashville.https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/crime-law/catholic-diocese- releases-list-tennessee-clergy-accused-child-sex- abuse/TJM7URRNMVFBPFPAJMLOLNJWW4/ Many are deceased and none are still remaining in active ministry. In July 2020, it was revealed that an adult female student at Aquinas College claimed that Diocese priest Father Kevin McGoldrick sexually assaulted her in 2017 and the Diocese of Nashville refused to investigate her allegation after she reported it to the Diocese in 2019.https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/catholic- newspaper-questions-how-nashville-diocese-handled-sex-abuse-complaint McGoldrick previously served as chaplain of Nashville's Dominican campus, which the Aquinas College is a part of.https://www.overbrook.edu/about- us/contact-us--directions He served the Dominican campus from August of 2013 until June of 2019. After the allegation was reported, the Diocese of Nashville refused to not only open a formal investigation about the allegation, but also refused to report it to McGoldrick's home diocese, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.

The southern terminus of the route is at an interchange with NY 17 (Future I-86) in the Southern Tier village of Owego, Tioga County. Its northern terminus is at a junction with East Main Street in the city of Rochester, Monroe County. Between the two endpoints, NY 96 passes through the city of Ithaca and the villages of Waterloo, Victor, and Pittsford. NY 96 is signed north‚Äìsouth for its entire length, although most of the route in Ontario County travels in an east‚Äìwest direction. All of NY 96, except from Candor to Ithaca and from northwest of Victor to Pittsford, was originally designated as part of New York State Route 15 in 1924. NY 15 was originally routed on modern NY 96B between Candor and Ithaca, and modern NY 64 and NY 251 between Victor and Pittsford. It was realigned onto the modern alignment of NY 96 between Victor and Pittsford in 1930. NY 15 was renumbered to New York State Route 2 to eliminate duplication with U.S. Route 15 (US 15). NY 2 was subsequently redesignated as NY 96 in 1942 as the alignments of NY 2 and NY 96, a route in Rensselaer County, were swapped. NY 96 was realigned again in the early 1950s, this time between Candor and Ithaca, to serve the village of Spencer west of Candor. Near Rochester, NY 96 followed what is now Interstate 490 (I-490) for a short time during the 1950s and early 1960s. The 2017 route log erroneously shows that NY 96's northern terminus ends at Union Street. Route description Most of NY 96's are maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, three sections of the route in Tompkins County and Monroe County are maintained by local highway departments. In the Tompkins County city of Ithaca, NY 96 is city-maintained from the southern city line to the start of the Fulton/Meadow Street one-way couplet, at which point maintenance of the highway reverts to NYSDOT. The route is also maintained by Ithaca from Park Road to the western city limits. The last locally owned section is in the Monroe County city of Rochester, where the entirety of NY 96 within the city is city-maintained. Tioga County Though unsigned at this point, NY 96 begins at the eastbound onramp to NY 17 at exit 64 on Southside Drive across the Susquehanna River from the Tioga County village of Owego. The route remains unsigned until the intersection of Court Street and Southside Drive, the western terminus of NY 434\\\\. NY 434 continues east along Southside Drive while NY 96, now fully signed, turns north onto Court Street and crosses the Susquehanna River. On the opposite side of the river, NY 96 intersects Front Street. The configuration of NY 96 between Front Street and East Main Street is unorthodox in that NY 96 splits at Front Street to follow a one-way couplet around the Tioga County Courthouse to Main Street, where both streets terminate. NY 96 turns onto Main Street for half a block to North Avenue, where it resumes its northward path. The route shares the parallel one-way streets with NY 17C, which enters Owego from the west via Main Street and leaves via Front Street to the east. From NY 17 (Future I-86) to the split with NY 38 in Owego, NY 96 is signed with reference markers as NY 38, even though full signage for NY 96 appears just before the Court Street Bridge. South end of the one-way couplet in Owego Now on North Avenue, NY 96 passes through the heart of Owego before leaving the village and following Owego Creek into a long stretch of rural country. Just over north of Owego village in the town of Owego, NY 96 meets the southern terminus of NY 38\\\\. At this point, NY 38 becomes the creekside highway while NY 96 passes over Owego Creek and follows Catatonk Creek northwest into the town of Candor. Once in Candor, the route and the creek turn northward toward the village of Candor, where NY 96 meets NY 96B, an alternate route of NY 96 between Candor and the city of Ithaca. Past NY 96B, NY 96 turns to the west and crosses over Catatonk Creek as it exits the village. West of Candor, NY 96 follows an east‚Äìwest alignment through a creek valley to the village of Spencer, where the route converges with NY 34 and heads north into another valley leading to Tompkins County. Tompkins County The two routes remain concurrent as they snake to the northwest through Tompkins County. Southwest of the city of Ithaca in the town of Ithaca, NY 34 and NY 96 meet NY 13\\\\. The three routes continue northeast through the town, intersecting NY 327 and NY 13A before crossing over the inlet of Cayuga Lake and entering the city of Ithaca on Meadow Street. Here, NY 96B reconnects to its parent at the junction of Clinton and Meadow Streets. North of this point, Meadow Street splits into a one-way couplet, with Fulton Street carrying southbound traffic and Meadow Street handling northbound traffic. NY 79, also routed on a one-way couplet here, crosses NY 96 at Green and Seneca Streets, with NY 79 eastbound using one block of Fulton Street to travel from State Street to Green Street. NY 89 and NY 96 northbound in Ithaca One block north of NY 79, NY 96 splits from NY 13 and NY 34 and heads to the west at Buffalo Street. NY 89 begins here, and NY 96 overlaps with NY 89 toward the West End of Ithaca. After crossing southbound NY 13 and NY 34, NY 89 and NY 96 run parallel to and a few feet to the north of NY 79\\\\. NY 89 turns north onto Taughannock Boulevard at the next intersection while NY 96 continues west across the lake outlet as Cliff Street, paralleling NY 79. They do not intersect in this area‚Äîknown locally as The Octopus‚Äîthough they once did. At one time, NY 96, NY 79, NY 89, NY 13A and Elm Street met at an intersection that gave the area its name. Today, only NY 13A and NY 79 intersect there while the stub of former NY 89 is now a park access road that intersects with NY 96, which continues north out of the Cayuga Lake valley as Trumansburg Road. Unlike NY 89, which runs along the base of the valley and parallels the west shore of Cayuga Lake, NY 96 heads away from the lake, increasing the distance between itself and the water body as it proceeds northwestward to the highlands overlooking the lake. The route heads across open fields and past isolated pockets of homes toward Trumansburg, where NY 96 crosses over Taughannock Creek and serves Taughannock Falls State Park southeast of the village. In Trumansburg itself, the highway becomes Main Street and meets the northern terminus of NY 227 in the center of the community. NY 96 continues on, exiting Trumansburg just before crossing the Seneca County line. Seneca County NY 96 proceeds northwest through a lightly populated section of Seneca County and the town of Covert to the village of Interlaken, home to the southern terminus of NY 96A, a more westerly alternate route of NY 96 between Interlaken and Geneva. Outside of the village, NY 96 continues on a northwesterly path for another to the Ovid‚ÄìRomulus town line, where it turns due west for to access the village of Ovid. The route mostly bypasses the village, with NY 96A and NY 414 serving as its Main Street instead. The three routes meet at a junction on the northern fringe of the community, at which point NY 96A leaves NY 414 and turns west to follow the town line toward Seneca Lake while NY 96 joins NY 414 and heads north into the town of Romulus. NY 96 southbound at US 20 and NY 5 in Waterloo Midway between the village of Ovid and the hamlet of Romulus, the two routes split, allowing NY 414 to continue due north to Seneca Falls. NY 96, meanwhile, turns to the northwest, following the eastern edge of the Seneca Army Depot for most of the distance to Romulus hamlet. Just south of the community's center, NY 96 separates from the depot grounds and continues north through the hamlet and into the town of Varick. The route uneventfully crosses the town, passing by open fields on a predominantly northward alignment on its way to the Fayette town line and a junction with NY 336, an east‚Äìwest connector between NY 96A and NY 414\\\\. NY 96 continues across rural terrain to the outskirts of the village of Waterloo, where the number of homes rises as the route enters the village on Fayette Street. In the southern half of the village, the highway follows a zig-zag routing as it leaves Fayette Street at River Road before returning to the north at Washington Street one block to the east. While on Washington Street, the route passes over the Cayuga‚ÄìSeneca Canal and enters the village's center, changing names to Virginia Street in the process. Not far to the north, NY 96 heads into Waterloo's central business district, built up around the junction of Virginia and Main (US 20 and NY 5) Streets. Past Routes 5 and 20, NY 96 continues north as a residential street to the village line, where the route turns to the west with a slight trend to the north. At this point, the scenery surrounding NY 96 shifts from house-lined streets to rural countryside once again, an appearance that follows the road to the northwest through the town of Waterloo and across the county line. Ontario County NY 14 on NY 96 south Although NY 96 travels mostly in an east‚Äìwest direction throughout Ontario County, it is still signed as a north‚Äìsouth highway. Less than into the county, NY 96 connects to NY 14 by way of a cloverleaf interchange, an oddity considering the rural location of the interchange. West of NY 14, NY 96 begins to parallel the paths of both the New York State Thruway (I-90) and the Canandaigua Lake outlet to the north. The highway follows both entities across the town of Phelps to the village of the same name, where NY 96 meets the southern terminus of NY 88\\\\. Just west of the village, NY 96 intersects the northern terminus of NY 488, formerly part of NY 88. West of the intersection, a northward reverse S-curve draws NY 96 closer to the Thruway and the outlet as the route heads toward the village of Clifton Springs, which NY 96 bypasses to the north. to the west in the village of Manchester, NY 96 crosses over the outlet (which roughly follows NY 21 south to Canandaigua Lake from this point out) and indirectly connects to the Thruway by way of a junction with NY 21 located north of the village center and just south of where NY 21 meets the Thruway at exit 43\\\\. West of NY 21, NY 96 curves gently to the south, crossing the Ontario Central Railroad before resuming its westward alignment near the grade crossing. At this point, NY 96 enters the town of Farmington and begins to parallel the Thruway once more. The route passes by Finger Lakes Gaming and Race Track, located between County Route 8 (CR 8) and NY 332, prior to intersecting NY 332 itself west of the race track. Eastview Mall, with NY 96 at bottom From this point northwestward to Rochester, NY 96 passes through substantially more developed areas. The first of these is the nearby village of Victor, which NY 96 enters by way of an overpass carrying it over the Ontario Central Railroad. In the village itself, the route meets the northern terminus of NY 444, which travels north‚Äìsouth between Victor and Bloomfield. West of the village in the town of Victor, NY 96 runs along the base of a valley separating it from the Thruway, where it intersects the eastern terminus of NY 251\\\\. The route continues on a northwesterly track for another mile (1.6 km) before curving to the north and widening from two to four lanes as it passes under the Thruway near exit 45\\\\. I-490, which begins at Thruway exit 45, is accessible from NY 96 by way of exit 29, the easternmost exit on I-490. The section of NY 96 between exit 29 and NY 250 in Perinton serves as a major commercial strip, anchored by the presence of Eastview Mall, one of the largest malls in the Rochester area and the largest east of the city. Also present along this stretch of NY 96 are a series of plazas, beginning with one just north of I-490 featuring a Walmart and a Kohl's. Continuing northward, NY 96 runs along the eastern edge of Eastview Mall and passes two more plazas, one of which is developed around a Kmart. The highway gradually turns northwest toward the county line as it passes the mall, and crosses into Monroe County at an intersection leading to Eastview Commons, a plaza separated from the mall by high-voltage power lines and a large ditch. Monroe County Entering Pittsford and approaching NY 31 on NY 96 southbound Roughly a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) from the county line, the commercial surroundings end as NY 96 intersects the southern terminus of NY 250 in the town of Perinton. to the northwest, NY 96 meets I-490 once again, this time at exit 28\\\\. West of the exit, NY 96 parallels I-490 for roughly , serving several office parks and Powder Mills Park before reconnecting to the freeway at exit 27, located on the southern edge of Bushnell's Basin, a small hamlet located directly on NY 96\\\\. North of the exit, NY 96 breaks from I-490 and parallels the Erie Canal through slightly less developed areas between Bushnell's Basin and Mitchell Road in the town of Pittsford, where it narrows to two lanes and becomes East Jefferson Road. West of Mitchell Road, NY 96 takes a more southerly alignment than the canal as it enters the densely populated village of Pittsford and meets the northern and eastern termini of NY 64 and NY 252, respectively, at the intersection of Jefferson Road and South Main Street. NY 64 heads to the south along South Main Street and NY 252 continues along Jefferson Road to the west while NY 96 turns north, proceeding into the heart of the village along South Main Street. In the village center, NY 96 intersects Monroe Avenue and State Street, which carry NY 31 east‚Äìwest through Pittsford. The route continues on, becoming North Main Street as it crosses the Erie Canal and passes under the CSX Transportation-owned West Shore Subdivision. Just north of the railroad overpass is a junction with the southern terminus of NY 153, the most direct route between Pittsford and nearby East Rochester. The last NY 96 marker heading northbound at Winton Road in Rochester Past NY 153, NY 96 exits the village of Pittsford and becomes East Avenue, a name the route retains to its terminus in downtown Rochester. It proceeds northward through the heavily residential town, passing by Nazareth College and meeting the western terminus of NY 31F (Fairport Road) at a junction adjacent to the campus of St. John Fisher College. East Avenue, and likewise NY 96, takes on the northwesterly, four-lane alignment set by Fairport Road and begins to parallel the routing of I-490 once more as both enter the town of Brighton. Not far to the northwest of the town line, NY 96 meets Elmwood and Linden Avenues, the latter carrying NY 441\\\\. About to the northwest, NY 96 intersects Penfield Road, the pre-expressway alignment of NY 441. One block from this point is Clover Street, which carries NY 65 south of East Avenue. At the Brighton town‚ÄìRochester city line, NY 96 passes through the center of the Can of Worms, a complex interchange that links I-490 to I-590. Here, I-590 passes under NY 96 while I-490 flies over NY 96\\\\. On the other side of the interchange in Rochester, East Avenue becomes a commercial strip once again, but to a lesser extent than in Victor. At North Winton Road, NY 96 is signed for the last time by way of a \\"North 96\\" reassurance assembly directing traffic to stay on East Avenue. Despite this fact, the route officially continues northwestward toward downtown Rochester. West of Winton, NY 96 passes through the East Avenue Historic District, a primarily residential area with historic upper-class houses, including the George Eastman House. This stretch of the route was narrowed in mid-2010 from four lanes to two, to improve the residential feel and reduce automobile speeds. At Alexander Street, the environment turns more commercial as the route enters the downtown area. After crossing Union Street, the route passes the Little Theatre before terminating at a Y-junction with East Main Street. History The Little Theatre on East Avenue (NY 96) in Rochester In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 36, an unsigned legislative route that extended from Owego to Seneca Falls via Candor, Ithaca, and Ovid. South of Romulus, Route 36 utilized what is now NY 96 and NY 96B. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Owego‚ÄìInterlaken and Ovid‚ÄìRomulus portions of legislative Route 36 became part of NY 15, which began in Owego and proceeded northwest from Romulus to Rochester by way of Waterloo, Phelps, Victor, Mendon, and Pittsford. From Mendon to Rochester, NY 15 followed the path of legislative Route 14, another highway dating back to 1908 that continued south from Mendon on what is now NY 64 and used Monroe Avenue between Pittsford and Rochester. Another section of NY 15‚Äîfrom the village of Phelps east to NY 14‚Äîutilized what had been designated as part of legislative Route 6-a from 1911 to 1921. By 1926, NY 31 was assigned across western and central New York, utilizing Monroe Avenue from downtown Rochester to Pittsford. Although NY 96's modern routing via East Avenue was state- maintained and formerly part of legislative Route 20 from current NY 31F westward, NY 15 initially remained on Monroe Avenue, creating an overlap between NY 15 and NY 31. It was realigned at some point between 1927 and 1932 to follow East Avenue to Rochester instead. In southern Seneca County, NY 15 initially passed through Lodi on its way from Interlaken to Ovid. It was realigned in the late 1920s to bypass Lodi to the northeast on the former alignment of legislative Route 36. The junction of NY 64 and NY 251 in Mendon. Prior to 1930, NY 15 entered this intersection from the east (right) and left to the north (straight). In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 15 basically remained intact. The only change made at this time was the straightening out of the Victor‚ÄìPittsford segment, which now bypassed Mendon in favor of a more direct alignment between the two villages via Bushnell's Basin. The former alignment of NY 15 became part of NY 251 east of Mendon and part of NY 64 north of the hamlet. US 15 was extended into New York ; it replaced NY 2, which had extended from the Pennsylvania state line to Rochester. NY 15 was renumbered to NY 2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the U.S. Highway. The NY 96 designation was originally assigned to present-day NY 2 from NY 7 in Troy to Route 2 at the Massachusetts state line.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering In 1942, the alignments of NY 2 and NY 96 were swapped, placing NY 96 on the Owego‚ÄìRochester routing. The only major change to NY 96 since that time came in the early 1950s, when the route was realigned between Candor and Ithaca to follow a new routing via Spencer. The Candor‚ÄìSpencer portion of the alignment had been part of NY 53 during the 1920s and part of NY 223 since 1930. NY 223 was truncated to its current eastern terminus at NY 224 near Van Etten as part of NY 96's realignment. Between Spencer and Ithaca, NY 96 overlapped with NY 34, which had occupied that segment of highway since the 1930 renumbering. In the 1950s, NY 96 was temporarily moved onto the Eastern Expressway as sections of the freeway opened to traffic. The first section extended from Bushnell's Basin to NY 31F and opened to traffic in November 1955, at which time NY 96 was routed onto the new highway and NY 252 and NY 64 were extended eastward and northward, respectively, to cover NY 96's old surface alignment. NY 31F, meanwhile, was truncated to begin at the expressway. A northwest extension to what is now the Can of Worms was completed as a realignment of NY 96, resulting in the re-extension of NY 31F to its original terminus and an extension of NY 64 along East Avenue to the eastern edge of Rochester. NY 64, NY 96, and NY 252 were restored to their pre-1950s alignments when the freeway was designated as I-490. Suffixed routes *NY 96A () is an alternate route of NY 96 in Seneca County.

The diocese is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Louisville. The diocese spans 32 counties of Western Kentucky and includes 78 parishes and two Newman Centers. The current bishop, William Medley, was the pastor of Saint Bernadette Parish of the Archdiocese of Louisville prior to his consecration which took place February 10, 2010. The original cathedral for the diocese was to be established in Henderson, Kentucky at Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church, but was changed to the city of Owensboro. The diocese's cathedral is named after St. Stephen, the first martyr of the Christian church. Sexual abuse In April 2019, the Diocese of Owensboro released a list of 15 priests who were accused of sexually abusing children while serving in the diocese. Two of these priests, Joseph J. Pilger and Louis Francis Piskula, were convicted, with Pilger receiving a five-year probation sentence in 1995 and Piskula receiving a five-year prison sentence in 2014. Piskula later died in prison in 2018. Two other credibly accused priests, Richard M. Powers and Joseph Robert \\"Bob\\" Willet, were forced to pay settlements in 1999. Pilger also was ordered to pay a $5.2M settlement to at least 27 accusers in 2003, the same year he was murdered. In 2018, the diocese removed Gerald Baker from active ministry in the diocese after determining that sexual abuse accusations against him were credible. In March 2019, the diocese temporarily suspended Joseph Edward \\"Ed\\" Bradley after allegations of sexual abuse of a minor were made. In May 2019, the diocese recommended that Bradley be permanently removed from public service. As of October 2019, the Vatican has not ruled on the recommendation.

Built in 1908, it was demolished in 1960. The theater was designed by architect Benjamin Marshall of the Chicago firm Marshall and Fox. History The theatre was named for U.S. actress Maxine Elliott (1868-1940), who originally owned a 50 percent interest in it in partnership with The Shubert Organization. Elliott was one of the few women theater managers of her time. She leased it to the Federal Theatre in 1936; the following year, it was shut down by the government on the eve on the opening of Orson Welles's production of The Cradle Will Rock. In 1941, the theatre became a radio studio and in 1948 was converted for television production, where the very first episodes of Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town variety show originated. In 1956, Elliott's heirs sold her share to the Shuberts, who then sold the property. It was demolished in 1960 to make way for the Springs Mills Building. The theatre, built in a thriving theatre district, was the last remaining Broadway house below 41st Street. Maxine Elliott's Theatre seated approximately 935 patrons. Throughout its lifetime, it housed a multitude of plays, including original works by George Bernard Shaw, John Millington Synge, Lady Augusta Gregory, Lord Dunsany, Lillian Hellman and Somerset Maugham. Only nine of its dozens of productions were musicals, including one opera, See America First by Cole Porter.

The AVLB consists of three major sections: the launcher, the vehicle hull, and the bridge. The M60 AVLB or Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge was introduced in 1963. This combat engineer vehicle was developed by the US Army Engineer Research & Development Laboratories under contract with General Dynamics to replace the previous M48 AVLB. It was designed to launch bridge for tanks and other wheeled combat vehicles across trenches and water obstacles in combat conditions. A total of 400 armored bridge launchers and bridges were built. 125 M60 AVLBs of all variants were constructed. Design Development In the early 1950s, the prototypes for US military Armored Vehicle-Launched Bridge (AVLB) were based on the M48A2 hull. This AVLB prototype launcher assembly used an M48 tank with its turret removed from the chassis, fitted with a launching system for the scissors bridge carried on top of the hull. This AVLB bridge launching system was designed and tested by the US Army Engineer Research & Development Laboratories at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. After the 1959 end of production of the M48, the chassis of the similar M60 was used, with 400 launcher assemblies and bridge units produced from 1958 to 1963. Many of these early bridge launcher units were later exported to Israel after the conclusion of the Vietnam War. Description The M60 AVLB is based on the M60 or the M60A1 hulls. Initial construction of the M60 AVLB was from 1963 to 1967. Most of the hulls for the M60A1 AVLB were former M60A2 Pattons converted to AVLBs from 1987 to 1996. All AVLBs were constructed at the Anniston Army Depot, Alabama under contract with General Dynamics Land Systems.http://www.tacom.army.mil/immc/Combat/heavy/avlb.htm The driver and commander are seated side by side in what would normally be the turret ring. Instead of a turret, launching equipment for a scissor bridge is fitted. The scissor bridge is carried in folded position on top of the chassis and the hydraulics for the launcher installed in the former driver's compartment. It is launched towards the front by means of a hydraulic launching arm. The driver has controls to launch and retrieve the bridge. The launching arm features a large bar that features as an outrigger during emplacement. After assault force vehicles have passed over the bridge, the AVLB can cross over, pick up the bridge on the far bank and continue along in support of assault forces. It can produce a limited smokescreen by dumping raw diesel fuel into the exhaust system to visually obscure the area around the vehicle. The smokescreen does not provide protection against infrared, thermal or laser detection. The vehicle does not provide full NBC protection to the crew. M60 AVLMs of the Idaho Army National Guard firing M58 MICLICThe vehicle itself is unarmed; however, the crewmembers are typically armed with assault rifles (M16 or M4), pistols, flares, and/or colored smoke grenades. The M60 AVLM carries up to 2 M58 Mine Clearing Line Charges mounted on the vehicle. The system consists of an M147 firing kit, an M58A3 line charge and a 5-inch MK22 Mod 4 rocket. The line charge is 350 feet long and contains 5 pounds per linear foot of C-4 explosive. In the event a MICLIC fails to detonate normally, it can be manually activated by time-delay fuses every few feet along the length of it.url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2007/06/marine_engineer_vehicle_070609/ The modification of the AVLB into an AVLM is a temporary expedient, to employ the system the vehicle cannot be carrying a bridge. Bridge assembly There were two bridge configurations, formally referred to as a Bridge, Armored-Vehicle Launched: Scissoring Type that were to be carried on the Patton chassis. The scissors-type bridge weights over 13 000 kg, is made of aluminum and can be deployed under armor protection in 3 to 10 minutes, and retrieved and stowed in 10 minutes to an hour depending on terrain. The Military Load Classification (MLC) 60 bridge has sufficient capacity to support the M48 and M60 families of armored vehicles. The MLC 70 bridge supports the heavier M1 Abrams family of armored vehicles. An upgraded MLC70 bridge was developed for the AVLB during the 1990s at Anniston Army Depot (ANAD). The bridge conversion added stronger materials. After a round of testing in 2012, the MLC 70 was reclassified to the MLC 85. 217 of these bridges were in U.S. inventory as of 2017.http://www.armyengineer.com/seminar_2017/AEA%20August%202017%20v5.pdf Service history United States Since its introduction in service in 1963, the M60 AVLB has supported the armored forces of the US Army and Marine Corps in many conflicts and military exercises. It was also exported to a handful of nations that also used the Patton series of tanks. Both the M48 AVLB and the M60 AVLB variants were deployed to Vietnam. REFORGER 1985, an M60 AVLB deploying its bridge on the banks of Lahn River During the Cold War, the M60A1 AVLB was deployed to West Germany with US Army Combat Engineer units in support of NATO, notably during annual REFORGER exercises through 1991. The US Army retired the M60 AVLB from combat use in 2003 and has been superseded by the M104 Wolverine. As of 2018 the vehicle is still in service with the Army National Guard. The US Marines received their first M60A1 AVLBs in the late 1980s. They have been deployed with Marines Corps armored divisions during Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait and Iraq in 1990 and 2003 Iraq War as well as Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. As of 2009, the Marines had an inventory of 55 bridges and 37 launchers in service. The M60-based AVLB has been found to be inadequate to support the M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley armored vehicles, and its age is making it difficult to maintain and sustain with parts becoming obsolete. Furthermore, the Army has determined that the M104 Wolverine is too costly to operate and maintain causing its production to be suspended. Both the Army and Marine Corps are planning to replace the vehicles with the M1074 Joint Assault Bridge (JABS). The JAB also has a faster deployment time, with a set-up of three minutes compared to AVLB's ten-minute set-up. First deliveries are planned in mid-2017, with low-rate initial production expected to be reached in 2019. Israel M60 Tagash AVLB with Tzmed bridge section The IDF refers to the AVLB as the Tagash. The first armored bridge layers to enter service with the Israel Defense Force were constructed from captured Jordanian M48s. The United States supplied launcher and bridge assemblies for the AVLBs through the 1970s. They were mated to M48 and M60 series hulls by Israeli Military Industries TAAS Slavin Plant. The Tagash AVLB has supported the IDF in the Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon War, 2006 Lebanon War and the 2014 Israel-Gaza Conflict. The IDF continues to use the M60A1-based bridge layers except with modifications. Vehicle modifications included new all-steel Merkava tracks and drive sprockets, although some vehicles continue to use the original T142 track. Due to the growing use of a number of trenches in fortifications and the greater number of natural narrower obstacles rather than larger ones, a tandem assembly bridge called the Tzmed or tandem was engineered. Two bridge sections can be fitted to any M60 AVLB system without any modification to the launcher. The main advantage to an up-and-out system compared to a horizontal system is the reduced mechanical complexity. The Tzmed assembly also enables the AVLB to bridge gaps in which the elevation of the opposing bank and the bridge itself, when laid out, is steep. The Tzmed assembly weighs in at only 13.5 tons with two bridge sections. Other users The Spanish Army began the Programa Coraza ‚Äì 2000 (Program Armor ‚Äì 2000) in March 1995 to modernize and update its armor forces. One of its goals is the development of a new armored vehicle launching bridge (AVLB), based on the M60A1 chassis and equipped with the new MLC 70 class Leguan bridge, which is capable of supporting the Leopard 2 A5 tanks, as well as any other tanks and armored vehicles in the Spanish inventory. For the time being in close liaison with Engineers at the Army Logistics Command has contracted for an initial 12 vehicles. They are still in service with a few other countries including Singapore and Pakistan.

This river flows in the province of Quebec, Canada, in the administrative regions of: * Capitale-Nationale: ** La Jacques-Cartier Regional County Municipality (municipalities of Stoneham-et-Tewkesbury, Saint- Gabriel-de-Valcartier); ** Portneuf Regional County Municipality (municipalities of Saint-Raymond, Saint-L√©onard-de-Portneuf, Sainte- Christine-d'Auvergne, Saint-Gilbert, Saint-Alban, Saint-Casimir); *Mauricie: Les Chenaux Regional County Municipality (municipality of Sainte-Anne-de-la- P√©rade). It is well known for ice fishing, with the primary catch being Tomcod, (poulamon in French), during the winter at Ste-Anne-de-la-P√©rade. A small village builds up from the end of December to mid-February. It is also regionally known for flooding, especially in St-Raymond, and sometimes in St- Casimir. Apart from the village areas, forestry, recreational tourism and agriculture are the main economic activities on this hydrographic side. The surface of the Sainte-Anne river (except the rapids areas) is generally frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally done from the end of December to the beginning of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.  Toponymy  The origin of the name of the river is unknown. Samuel de Champlain gave it the name of Sainte-Marie river in 1609 without specifying its reasons. It was registered under the name of Sainte-Anne river on the map of Jean Bourdon of 1641, an appellation which quickly became essential. The Hurons, meanwhile, call it \\"Telahiar\\". The toponym \\"Rivi√®re Sainte-Anne\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.

The confluence of the Sainte-Anne river with the St. Lawrence river is located downstream of the confluence of the Batiscan River.  Hydrology  The watershed has an area of .. Its average flow at its mouth is 78 m3/s. The main tributaries of the river are, from upstream to downstream, the Tourilli River, the Ch√©zine River, the Talayarde River, the Bras du Nord, Jacquot River, Noire River, Blanche River, Niagarette River and Charest River. It also includes of watercourse. The basin includes 828 lakes, the most important of which are Lakes Montauban, Long, Blanche, Carillon and Clair.  Geology  Sainte-Anne is part of two geological provinces. Upstream of Saint-Alban, the subsoil is part of the Laurentides, and is composed of igneous rocks and metamorphic, mainly gneiss and granite, resistant to erosion. The river enters the St. Lawrence Lowlands downstream from Saint-Alban and the source rock consists mainly of limestone and shale from the Paleozoic. The whole is covered with marine and continental deposits from the Quaternary, the thickness of which is approximately in the St. Lawrence Lowlands and less than in the Laurentians.  Population  It is estimated that there were approximately 16000 people who lived in the Sainte-Anne basin in 2001. The town of Saint-Raymond alone has half the population of the basin. Four other villages are located on the course of the river, namely Sainte-Christine-d'Auvergne, Saint-Alban, Saint-Casimir and Sainte-Anne-de-la-P√©rade.  Natural environments  Forest in the Bras du Nord valley The north of the basin is included in the zecs of zec de la Rivi√®re-Blanche and Batiscan-Neilson as well as the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. The southwest of the basin is included in the Lacs-Long-et-Montauban Regional Park. The forest dominates, occupying 80% of the hydrographic basin. The public forest, which includes 56% of the forest area, is composed of 58% of mixed forests, 26% of coniferous and 16% of broadleaved. The basin extends over four bioclimatics areas, namely maple grove to linden, maple grove to yellow birch, the fir with yellow birch and the fir white birch. The river and its tributaries is frequented by 33 species of fish. The main species used for sport fishing living in the river are brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), walleye (Sander vitreus) and the smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu). Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod)) The river is also recognized as an important spawning ground for the Atlantic tomcod (Microgadus tomcod). There are between 600 and {800 million of individuals who come to breed in the river between December and February, two million of which are fished each year. The spawning ground would have been created in 1894 by a major landslide at Saint- Alban, giving the river a bottom of sand and gravel ideal for the reproduction of fish.  History  The river was known to the St. Lawrence Iroquoians who already practiced there ice fishing around the year 1000. The Atlantic tomcod population was rediscovered in the river in 1938. Ice fishing quickly became a popular activity, developing a village up to 1200 huts. The combined pressure of commercial fishing and sport fishing caused the decline of the fish population.

The First United States Army launched the operation in March 1945 to capture strategic cities in Nazi Germany and to give the Allies a foothold along the Rhine. One unexpected outcome was the capture of the Ludendorff bridge, a strategic railroad bridge across the Rhine, in the Battle of Remagen. Despite German attempts to destroy the bridge, Allied forces captured it intact and were able to use it for ten days to establish a bridgehead on the far side, before it finally collapsed at 3:00 PM on 17 March 1945 after months of aircraft bombing, direct artillery hits, near misses, and demolition attempts.  Background  The Germans had repeatedly frustrated Allied efforts to cross the Rhine. With the 21st Army Group firmly established along the Rhine, U.S. General of the Army Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group prepared to execute Operation Lumberjack. Bradley‚Äôs plan called for the U.S. First Army to attack southeastward toward the juncture of the Ahr and Rhine Rivers and then swing south to meet Lieutenant General George Patton, whose U. S. Third Army would simultaneously drive northeastward through the Eifel. If successful, Lumberjack would capture Cologne, secure the Koblenz sector, and bring the 12th Army Group to the Rhine in the entire area north of the Moselle River. The 12th Army Group also hoped to capture a large number of Germans. Following Lumberjack, the Allies had planned for a pause along the Rhine while Montgomery's 21st Army Group began Operation Plunder, a large, carefully planned movement across the Rhine near D√ºsseldorf and the Dutch border. Montgomery would then capture the Ruhr, the industrial heartland of Germany.

They were to secure the region between Mosel and the Duren-Cologne and to destroy the German army's capability to fight in that area. The First Army was to seize the entire region west of the Rhine. After capturing Cologne, the First Army was to wheel southeast and join up with Patton's Third Army. Patton was supposed to capture the Eifel Mountains and then the Mosel Valley, trapping the remainder of the German Seventh Army in the Eifel area.

Over 75,000 German troops were on the western banks of the bridge. Their only escape route was across the Ludendorff bridge. Written permission was required to destroy the bridge because on 14‚Äì15 October 1944, an American bomb had struck the Mulheim Bridge in Cologne and hit the chamber containing the demolition charges, prematurely destroying the bridge. Hitler was angered by this incident and ordered those \\"responsible\\" for the destruction of the Mulheim Bridge to be court-martialed. He also ordered that demolition explosives should not be laid in place until the very last moment, when the Allies were within of the bridge. The bridges should only be demolished following an order in writing from the officer in charge, and only as a last resort and at the last possible moment. This order left officers responsible for destroying bridges nervous about both the consequences if they blew up the bridge too soon and if they failed to blow it up at all.  Battle  The Ludendorff Bridge (German: Ludendorffbr√ºcke) four hours before it collapsed, ten days after it was captured by the Allies. Bradley launched Lumberjack on 1 March. In the north, the First Army rapidly exploited bridgeheads over the Erft River, entering Euskirchen on 4 March and Cologne on the fifth. Cologne was in U.S. Army control by the 7th. The First Army then pushed towards the Ahr River valley, the likely point of retreat for what was left of the German Army's LXVI and LXVII Korps. The U.S. Third Army met some resistance along the Siegfried Line and the Pr√ºm and Kyll Rivers. On 4 March at Bitburg, the 5th Infantry Division cut through the German lines. Taking advantage of the breach, the Fourth Armored Division struck out on a drive to the Rhine in less than five days. While losing only 100 casualties, they cost the Germans 5,700 killed and wounded. The Fourth Armored barely missed the chance to capture a bridge at Urmitz. While moving towards the Ahr, the U.S. 9th Armored Division on the right flank of the First Army had moved swiftly towards the Rhine. The closer the division got to the Rhine, the more quickly it advanced. The speed of their movement towards the Rhine surprised the Germans. About upstream from Bonn, they unexpectedly found the Ludendorff railroad bridge still standing.  Battle of Remagen  During Operation Lumberjack, on 7 March 1945, when troops of the U.S. Army's 9th Armored Division Combat Command B, 9th Armored Engineer Battalion reached the river, they were very surprised to see that the railroad bridge was still standing. It was one of the two damaged but usable bridges over the Rhine (the other being the Wesel Railway Bridge). U.S. forces were able to capture the bridge. The Rhine was the last natural line of defense that the Germans hoped could be used to substantially resist the Western Allied advance. Up to then, crossings had been limited to small infantry reconnaissance patrols by boat. When word that the bridge was still standing reached General William Hoge, commander of Combat Command B, he ordered the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion to advance into Remagen with support from the 14th Tank Battalion. After German demolition charges failed to destroy the bridge, the U.S. troops captured the bridge and in the next ten days 25,000 troops comprising six divisions established a wide beachhead on the eastern side of the Rhine.  Impact on war plans  The capture of the bridge convinced the Allied high command in Western Europe that they could envelop the German industrial area of the Ruhr as opposed to focusing primarily on General Bernard Montgomery's plan, Operation Plunder, which would bring the British 21st Army Group across the Rhine into northern Germany. The unexpected availability of the first major crossing of the Rhine, Germany's last major natural barrier and line of defense, caused Allied high commander Dwight Eisenhower to alter his plans to end the war. The ability to quickly establish a bridgehead on the eastern side of the Rhine and to get forces into Germany allowed the U.S. forces to envelop the German industrial area of the Ruhr. The Allies were able to get six divisions across the Rhine before the Ludendorff Bridge collapsed ten days after it was captured on 17 March. Twenty-five soldiers were killed or went missing and three died later from injuries; 63 others were injured.Charles B. MacDonald A Rhine Bridge at Remagen p.230 gives casualties as 28 Killed/93 injured Before it collapsed, five U.S. divisions had already used it and two adjacent tactical bridges to cross into Germany, creating a well-established bridgehead almost long, extending from Bonn in the north almost to Koblenz in the south, and deep. The bridge was not rebuilt after the war. However, the bridge towers remain and in 1980 a peace museum was opened to the public.Peace Museum Bridge at Remagen Website of the museum. Retrieved July 21, 2013.  Aftermath  Operation Lumberjack succeeded in clearing the Rhine north of Mosel of effective German forces. The Allies destroyed four corps of the German 15th and 7th Armies. The capture of the bridge at Remagen was an unexpected bonus that advanced the timetable for crossing the Rhine. Patton and Bradley were able to move up their scheduled crossings of the Rhine. General Albert Kesselring described the battle as the \\"Crime of Remagen. It broke the front along the Rhine.\\" Hermann G√∂ring said that the capture of the bridge \\"made a long defense impossible.\\" Major General Carl Wagener, chief of staff to Field Marshall Walter Model, said that capturing the bridge signaled the end of the war for the Germans:  In popular culture  The battle was depicted in the novel The Bridge at Remagen by Ken Hechler, which was later adapted into the film of the same name.

The Court is composed of thirty judges with life tenure who are nominated by the High Council of Justice of Belgium and appointed by the Belgian federal government. The Court handles cases in the two main languages of Belgium, being Dutch and French, and provides certain facilities for cases in German. The Court is assisted in its work by a public prosecutor's office and a bar association, which both function separately from other structures. The duty of the public prosecutor's office is to provide advisory opinions to the Court on how the law ought to be interpreted and applied. The attorneys of the Court's bar association assist litigants in proceedings before the Court; in certain cases their assistance is mandatory. The Belgian Court of Cassation was originally modelled after its French namesake, and its jurisdiction and powers are still very similar to those of its French counterpart. The Court is a court of cassation; meaning that it only hears appeals in last resort against decisions of lower courts and tribunals, and only on points of law. This means the Court of Cassation will not review or reconsider the findings of fact established by the lower court or tribunal. The jurisdiction of the Court is limited to either upholding a decision that is contested, or either annulling (quashing) the contested decision if the decision violated or misinterpreted the law. The latter is referred to as \\"cassation\\". By these means, the Court is in effect the supreme interpreter of Belgian law, and as such ensures the nationwide uniform interpretation and application of the law by all other courts and tribunals of the Belgian judiciary. Generally speaking, the Court of Cassation only exercises supreme jurisdiction over judicial decisions, and thus does not hear appeals against administrative decisions (which is the realm of the Council of State of Belgium). The Court of Cassation also does not rule on the constitutionality of laws, which is the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court of Belgium. However, some decisions of certain non-judicial bodies are within the purview of the Court of Cassation nonetheless. The Court also settles jurisdictional conflicts which may or may not involve an administrative court. Furthermore, the Court rules on certain prejudicial questions from other courts and on certain requests to review old criminal cases. Lastly, the Court handles certain proceedings against judicial officers (magistrates; which encompasses judges and prosecutors in Belgian legal terminology), including recusal requests against a particular judge or prosecutor, requests to disqualify a judge or entire court, and requests to hold judges or prosecutors civilly liable for respectively judicial misconduct or prosecutorial misconduct. A ruling or judgment of the Court of Cassation is officially called an \\"arrest\\" (, , ). An important aspect of the Court of Cassation is that it has no discretionary power to select the cases it hears, which means it must consider all cases correctly brought before it. The only filter that exists is the mandatory intervention of an attorney in certain cases. For this reason, the Court handles a fairly large number of cases each year compared to some other supreme courts. For example, the Court received about 2,500 petitions to initiate proceedings in 2019. A second aspect is that the Court does not make public any individual opinions of its judges; it always issues one single ruling in each case. Lastly, the rulings of the Court are only binding for the case at hand, and do not have the value of stare decisis. Lower courts are thus not officially required to adhere to the rulings of the Court of Cassation in earlier cases. However, the Court's rulings still have an important persuasive value for lower courts nonetheless; especially any so- called jurisprudence constante following from the Court's case law. Court structure  Judges  √âtienne Constantin, Baron de Gerlache (1785-1871) was appointed as the first-ever first president after the creation of the Court. The Court of Cassation is composed of thirty judges with life tenure (notwithstanding their retirement), who are officially called \\"counsellors\\" (, , ). For the sake of clarity, the term 'judge' will be used in this article. The thirty judges are divided into three chambers with each ten judges. The three chambers are each further divided into two sections, a Dutch one and a French one, each composed of five judges. This means that in principle, half of the Court's judges are Dutch-speaking and the other half French-speaking. However, some of the judges are required to master both Dutch and French, so as to facilitate joint hearings and sessions of the Court. Each of the judges can serve in any of the chambers and sections given they speak the relevant language. Whilst the Court counts thirty positions for judges, temporary vacancies can exist when for example one of the Court's judges retires. The judges retire when they reach the statutory retirement age of 70. To be appointed as judge to the Court, candidates must hold the Belgian nationality, must hold a law degree, must have been active in the legal sphere for at least fifteen years, and must have been a judge or prosecutor for at least ten years. Candidates must also meet the language requirements and have a clean criminal record. An opinion on each candidate will be provided to the federal Minister of Justice by the general assembly of the Court of Cassation (see further below), by the head of the court or prosecutor's office where the candidate is currently active, and by the relevant bar association. The minister of Justice will then send all candidacies to the High Council of Justice of Belgium, who will nominate one candidate. The Belgian federal government (officially \\"the King\\" as the personification of the executive) will then finally appoint or reject the nominated candidate. In each of the six sections, a judge is appointed as \\"section president\\" (, , ). Out of the thirty judges, one is also appointed as \\"first president\\" (, , ) and one as \\"president\\" (, , ) for the whole Court of Cassation. The overall leadership over the Court lies with the first president (the \\"chief justice\\"); the president has a deputy position regarding the first president. If the first president belongs to the French-speaking half of the Court, the president will be chosen from the Dutch-speaking half and vice versa, so as to preserve the linguistic balance on the Court. As of 2020, the first president of the Court of Cassation is Beatrijs Deconinck (Dutch-speaking) and the president is ridder Jean De Codt (French-speaking). In 2019, Mrs Deconinck became the first female first president in the Court of Cassation's history.  Prosecutor's office  Jean-Louis van Dievoet (1777-1854) was the first secretary to the Court's prosecutor's office, after the Kingdom's independence. There is a public prosecutor's office attached to the Court of Cassation, which is referred to as the prosecutor-general's office (, , ). The prosecutor- general's office is led by the prosecutor-general at the Court of Cassation (, , ). The prosecutor-general's office furthermore consists of one first advocate-general (, , ), who has a deputy position regarding the prosecutor- general, and eleven advocates-general (, , ). The thirteen members of the prosecutor-general's office exercise the duties of the office in all cases brought before the Court (see further below). Just like with the first president and president of the Court, if the prosecutor-general belongs to the French-speaking members of the office, the first advocate-general will be chosen from the Dutch-speaking members and vice versa, so as to preserve the linguistic balance on the office. As of 2020, the prosecutor-general at the Court of Cassation is Andr√© Henkes (French-speaking) and the first advocate- general is Ria Mortier (Dutch-speaking). Bar The Court of Cassation has its own bar association, consisting of a number of \\"attorneys at the Court of Cassation\\" (, , ). The number of attorneys at the Court of Cassation is set by the Belgian federal government (currently twenty attorneys). These attorneys, whilst not employed by or part of the Court, play an important role in the proceedings before the Court nonetheless (see further below). Attorneys wishing to be admitted to the bar at the Court of Cassation, must have been part of another bar association for at least ten years and must pass a specific bar examination. When one of the twenty positions at the bar becomes vacant, the Belgian federal government will appoint a new attorney meeting these criteria to the bar. The bar association is headed by the president of the bar (, , ). As of 2020, Jacqueline Oosterbosch is president of the bar.  Auxiliary services  Administrative matters related to the judicial duties of the Court of Cassation are handled by the court clerks (, , ) of the clerk's office (, , ) of the Court. In this capacity, the clerk's office receives petitions and pleadings related to proceedings before the Court, keeps the records and notes of the Court, and provides the Court's rulings to the parties involved. The Court of Cassation and its prosecutor-general's office also dispose over a number of law clerks called \\"referendaries\\" (, , ). The referendaries assist the judges and the members of the prosecutor's office in preparing their rulings and advisory opinions, maintain documentation related to the Court's duties, and work on the translation and publication of the Court's rulings. Lastly, the Court also employs a number of attach√©s, as well as magistrates from other courts or tribunals with a temporary assignment. They work on the translation of the Court's rulings, on maintaining documentation, and on certain studies and legal research in the interest of the Court. Jurisdiction  Appeals in cassation   Annulment of court decisions  An appeal in cassation (, , ) to the Court of Cassation is only possible against decisions (judgments, rulings and court orders) from other (lower) courts in the judiciary, against which all ordinary appeal procedures have been exhausted. This usually concerns the judgments and rulings rendered by the courts of appeal and the courts of labour, as well as some judgments and rulings rendered by lower courts in specific or petty cases. The Court of Cassation does not re-examine any findings of fact; it will only rule on questions of law concerning the contested decision. Neither can the Court change the content of any contested decision. Its jurisdiction is limited to either upholding a contested decision, rendering it final and irrevocable; or either annulling it (\\"cassation\\", from the French verb casser, \\"to break\\" or \\"to quash\\") if the Court finds the decision to violate the law. This is the case if the Court finds that the decision misjudged or misinterpreted the law, breached essential procedural requirements or ignored formalities prescribed under penalty of nullity. The Court can annul the entire decision or only part of it, which is known as \\"partial cassation\\" (, , ). If the Court annuls (part of) a decision, it will generally remit the case to a different court of the same rank as the one whose decision was annulled. In specific cases, the case will be remitted to the same court though, which will then rehear the case in a different composition however (meaning by different judges as the first time). After annulment by the Court of Cassation, the (annulled part of the) case is always tried de novo, both on questions of fact and on questions of law, by the court to which it has been referred. Any such court is thus not bound by any findings of fact preceding the cassation proceedings. In some specific instances though, the Court will not remit the case to any court for a retrial after cassation, namely when there is nothing left to judge on by virtue of the Court's ruling. This is known as \\"cassation without referral\\" (, , ). A cassation without referral can for example occur when the Court annuls an arrest warrant because it was issued outside of the statutory time limit. The principle that the Court of Cassation does not rule on questions of fact, is laid down in article 147 of the Belgian Constitution.  Only judicial decisions  Like many other European countries, Belgium has a system of administrative courts which oversee the lawfulness of acts of administrative authorities. The system of administrative courts is distinct from the judiciary, and as such, the jurisdiction of the Court of Cassation regarding annulment does not extend to judgments and rulings rendered by those courts. The jurisdiction of the Court of Cassation is limited to judgments and rulings rendered by judicial courts. However, the exceptions are any jurisdictional conflict between the judicial and administrative courts, as well as rulings from the Belgian Court of Audit and some disciplinary bodies, as explained below.  Rulings of the Court of Audit  Administrative rulings from the Belgian Court of Audit however do fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of Cassation. The Court of Audit decides by administrative ruling whether the accounts of public accounting officers answerable to the Treasury are in balance or not, and if not whether the balance is in their favour or in the State's favour. If the Court of Audit determines that the account of an accounting officer shows a deficit, the Court of Audit will hold a public hearing with the officer in question. The Court of Audit will subsequently either grant discharge to the accounting officer, or either find the officer at fault and sentence him to fully or partially indemnify the State from his own means. The Court of Cassation hears appeals in cassation against such rulings of the Court of Audit. If the Court of Cassation finds that the ruling violates the law, the Court will annul it, and refer the case to a committee formed ad hoc from members of the legislative assembly concerned (for the federal government: the Belgian Chamber of Representatives). This ad hoc committee will then rule on the case without the possibility of any subsequent appeal.  Rulings of disciplinary bodies  The second kind of non-judicial rulings that nevertheless fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of Cassation, are disciplinary rulings by some professional bodies for liberal professions. This concerns rulings in disciplinary cases issued by, amongst others, the Belgian Order of Physicians, the Belgian Order of Pharmacists, the Belgian Order of Veterinarians, the Belgian Order of Architects, the bar associations, the Belgian Institute of Company Auditors, and the Belgian Institute of Accountants and Tax Advisors. This also concerns rulings in disciplinary cases issued by the tribunals of first instance against notaries or court bailiffs. The Court of Cassation hears appeals in cassation against such disciplinary rulings. If the Court of Cassation finds that the ruling violates the law, the Court will annul it, and refer the case back to the professional body concerned. If possible however, the professional body concerned must rehear the case in a different composition (meaning by different members as the first time). The professional body concerned is obliged to adhere to the ruling of the Court of Cassation with regards to the points of law on which it ruled.  Jurisdictional conflicts   Between judicial and administrative courts  The Court of Cassation has generally speaking no jurisdiction over judgments and rulings rendered by administrative courts. The Council of State is the supreme court within the Belgian system of administrative courts, which as such handles cassation proceedings against administrative judgments or rulings from lower authorities. However, article 158 of the Belgian Constitution lays down that the Court of Cassation rules on any so-called \\"conflict of attribution\\" (Dutch: conflict van attributie, French: conflit d'attribution, German: Kompetenzkonflikt) between administrative and judicial courts. These conflicts of attribution can arise in the following forms: * Any party to administrative proceedings who believes the Council of State overstepped its administrative jurisdiction in a case, or vice versa believes the Council of State unduly declared it had no jurisdiction because it deemed a case as not administrative in nature, can seek the annulment of any such ruling by the Council before the Court of Cassation. If the Court of Cassation annuls the ruling of the Council based on the ground that the Council does have jurisdiction (and unduly declared it did not), the case will referred back to the Council. The Council will then hear the case again in a different composition (meaning by different judges as the first time) and is required to adhere to the Court of Cassation's ruling regarding its proper jurisdiction. * A particular case arises when a judicial court and an administrative court both declare they have jurisdiction in a particular case (\\"positive conflicts\\"), or vice versa when they both declare themselves incompetent to hear a particular case (\\"negative conflicts\\"). The Court of Cassation is competent to settle these matters as well. By these procedures, the Court of Cassation has the final say over the jurisdictional division between the judicial and administrative courts.  Between different judicial courts  The Court of Cassation also rules on certain jurisdictional conflicts between different courts or tribunals within the judiciary. Although the particularities differ between criminal and non-criminal cases, these procedures are jointly referred to as \\"regulation of jurisdiction\\" (Dutch: regeling van rechtsgebied, French: r√®glement de juges, German: Bestimmung des zust√§ndigen Gerichts). In criminal cases, jurisdictional conflicts can arise when two distinct cases concerning the same crime are brought before two different courts (\\"positive conflicts\\"). A jurisdictional conflict can also arise when one court or judge (usually in an investigative capacity) refers a criminal case to another court or judge (usually a trial court), but the latter declares itself incompetent to hear the case (\\"negative conflicts\\"). If both courts involved in such positive or negative conflicts do not belong to the same territorial jurisdiction, and the matter thus cannot be settled by an appellate court, the Court of Cassation will settle the matter and refer the case to the appropriate court. The applicable procedures for settling such conflicts in criminal cases are laid down in the Belgian Code of Criminal Procedure. In non-criminal (civil, commercial, ...) cases, jurisdictional conflicts can arise when multiple conflicting judgments have been rendered by multiple courts or judges concerning the same or interrelated lawsuits, on the condition that all ordinary appeal procedures have been exhausted against these judgments. If such is the case, any party to the proceedings may request the Court of Cassation to resolve the conflict. The Court will do so by annulling either judgment and, if there is cause, refer the case to the appropriate court for a retrial. The applicable procedures for settling these conflicts are laid down in the Belgian Judicial Code.  Prejudicial questions  Under Book IV, Title II, Chapter II (articles IV.86‚ÄìIV.89) of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, the Court of Cassation must answer any prejudicial question (, , ) asked by another court concerning a case pending before it. The question must concern the interpretation of any provision of Book IV of the aforementioned code of law (on the topic of competition law). These questions will mostly arise in cases before the Market Court involving a decision of the Belgian Competition Authority (BCA). The federal minister of the Economy of Belgium, the European Commission and the BCA may provide an advisory opinion to the Court as amicus curiae. The Court of Cassation will then issue a preliminary ruling on the question asked, and the requesting court must adhere to the ruling of the Court of Cassation with regards to the points of law on which it ruled.  Review of old criminal cases  Belgian law provides for two extraordinary procedures through the Court of Cassation to review old criminal cases, in which a final and (in principle) irrevocable conviction has already been rendered, to correct miscarriages of justice. The first procedure is referred to as the \\"reopening of the procedure\\" (, , ). A request to \\"reopen the procedure\\" can be initiated in a particular criminal case when the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the prosecution undertaken or judgment rendered in that case violated the European Convention on Human Rights. If the alleged violation concerns a judgment from a lower court, the Court of Cassation will annul that judgment if there is cause and either remit the case to a different court of the same rank for a retrial, or otherwise pronounce a cassation without referral. If the alleged violation concerns a ruling of the Court of Cassation itself, the Court will examine the request in a different composition (meaning by different judges) as that in which the contested ruling was rendered. If the request is honoured, the Court will revoke its earlier ruling and issue a new one, taking into account the decision of the European Court of Human Rights. The second procedure is referred to as \\"request for revision\\" (, , ). A request for revision can be submitted (notwithstanding some exceptions) when the accused has been sentenced for the same charges by multiple conflicting judgments and the innocence of the accused can be deduced from the conflicting judgments, when one of the witnesses in the case has been convicted for perjury, or when new evidence has come to light that could have led to the accused either being acquitted or being sentenced to a lesser penalty. When the Court grants the request in a case of conflicting judgments or perjury, it will annul the contested lower court judgment and remit the case to a different court of the same rank for a retrial. When new evidence has come to light and the Court finds that the request is admissible and there is a potential cause for revision, it will refer the case to the 'Commission for revision in penal cases'. This is a commission consisting of five members who are appointed by the federal minister of Justice of Belgium. This commission will further examine the request and provide a non-binding opinion to the Court of Cassation. The Court will then either reject the request or grant it; if the request is granted, the contested conviction will be annulled and the case will be referred to the appropriate court for a retrial.  Proceedings against judicial officers   Recusal  In any judicial proceedings, any party may request a magistrate (judge or prosecutor) to recuse themself (, , ) for a number of causes, such as for an appearance of bias, family ties with any party involved, prior involvement in the case, or a conflict of interest. If a magistrate refuses to recuse themself upon such a request, the court immediately higher in the Belgian judicial hierarchy will decide on the matter. As such, the Court of Cassation will decide on any requests to oblige a magistrate from a court of appeal or a court of labour to recuse themself from a case. Since there is no higher court in the Belgian judicial hierarchy, the Court of Cassation itself will also decide on any request to oblige any of its own magistrates to recuse themselves. The applicable procedures are provided for in the Belgian Judicial Code.  Judicial disqualification  Belgian law also provides for an extraordinary procedure for judicial disqualification (, , ), i.e. to remove a case from a judge or entire court, and refer it to another judge or court, through the Court of Cassation. For criminal cases, the applicable procedures are laid down in the Belgian Code of Criminal Procedure; for non-criminal (civil, commercial, ...) cases, these are laid down in the Belgian Judicial Code. A judge or entire court can only be disqualified for a select number of causes, such as for an appearance of bias, or in case a final judgment has not been rendered yet from six months since the proceedings were concluded. The prosecutor-general at the Court of Cassation may also request a judicial disqualification for public security reasons. If the Court of Cassation grants the request, it will indicate the judge or court to which the case will be referred.  Liability in case of misconduct  Belgian law provides for an extraordinary procedure known as \\"redress from the judge\\" (, , ) as well. This procedure through the Court of Cassation is meant to hold magistrates (judges or prosecutors) civilly liable in cases of judicial misconduct or prosecutorial misconduct, as established by the law. The applicable procedures to hold magistrates liable are laid down in the Belgian Judicial Code. A judge or prosecutor may be held liable for deceitful acts during an investigation or adjudication, or for other acts for which the law explicitly holds them liable. A judge may also be held liable for \\"denial of justice\\" (, , ), when they refuse to adjudicate a case that is correctly brought before them. Prosecutors cannot be held liable for denial of justice because they have the power to exercise prosecutorial discretion. If the Court grants a request to hold a magistrate liable, the Court will order the magistrate to pay damages to the claimant, and may annul any fraudulent act if there is cause. If the Court rejects the request, it may order the claimant to pay damages to the magistrate involved.  Disciplinary proceedings  Lastly, the Court of Cassation has the power to initiate disciplinary proceedings against its own members and certain members of lower courts. For instance, the first president of the Court is responsible for initiating disciplinary proceedings against the other judges of the Court, or against the first presidents of the courts of appeal and the courts of labour. The general assembly of the Court (see further below) in turn is responsible for initiating disciplinary proceedings against the Court's first president. The prosecutor-general at the Court can also initiate disciplinary proceedings against all judges of the Court, or against the other members of the prosecutor-general's office. The federal minister of Justice of Belgium in turn is responsible for initiating disciplinary proceedings against the prosecutor-general at the Court. All the aforementioned only serves to initiate proceedings however, because disciplinary proceedings against magistrates are decided on by non-permanent disciplinary tribunals for the judiciary. These disciplinary tribunals are only assembled once disciplinary proceedings are initiated. They are composed of judges appointed to them for a five-year term. The disciplinary tribunals can decide to apply disciplinary sanctions up to removal from office. A sole disciplinary power exercised by the Court of Cassation itself is that against members of the Council of State, the Belgian supreme administrative court. The Court of Cassation decides in general assembly (see further below) on disciplinary proceedings, concerning suspension or removal from office, against members of the Council of State.  Court procedure  Standard courtroom of the Court of Cassation in the Palace of Justice, Brussels. Old image of the Court's grand courtroom in the Palace of Justice, Brussels. This stately courtroom is used for sessions too large for the standard courtroom, as well as for certain judicial ceremonies.  Role of the prosecutor's office  Unlike the public prosecutor's offices attached to other courts, the prosecutor-general's office attached to the Court of Cassation does not engage in any criminal investigations or prosecutions. The prosecutor-general's office functions independently and separately from the rest of the Public Prosecution Service of Belgium. Its function is to provide an advisory opinion to the Court regarding the legality and regularity of any contested judgment or ruling, and the manner in which to interpret and apply the law to any case. In this capacity, the prosecutor- general's office intervenes in all cases brought before the Court. It is for example possible for the prosecutor-general's office to request the annulment of a criminal conviction, secured by a lower prosecutor's office before a lower court, if it finds the conviction to be based on a misinterpretation of the law or in breach of essential procedural requirements. In some cases, the prosecutor-general's office may initiate cassation proceedings itself \\"in the name of the law\\" against certain decisions it finds to violate the law.  Role of the bar  In all cases, except criminal and fiscal cases, the intervention of an attorney at the Court of Cassation (one of the twenty members of the Court's bar association) is mandatory. Any petition to start cassation proceedings in these cases must be signed by an attorney at the Court. Other attorneys are therefore required to involve an attorney at the Court if they wish to start cassation proceedings. This way, the attorneys at the Court fulfill a certain filter function; they are meant to discourage claimants from starting proceedings that will likely be unsuccessful. It is possible though for attorneys at the Court to sign a petition \\"on request\\" when they think it has little chances of success, to allow a claimant to start proceedings regardless. Attorneys at the Court may only draw up and sign a petition, or they may be requested by a claimant to also handle the rest of the cassation proceedings before the Court. In criminal cases, the intervention of an attorney at the Court is not mandatory, but since 2015 any petition to start cassation proceedings in criminal cases must be signed by an attorney with a special certificate. This special certificate can be obtained by any attorney who has followed a specific training. In fiscal cases (cases concerning tax law), the intervention of an attorney is required as well, but this attorney does not have to meet any specific requirements. Any attorney may thus initiate cassation proceedings in fiscal cases.  Legal aid  Any party who cannot afford the costs and fees related to cassation proceedings, can submit a request for legal aid to the bureau for legal aid (, , ) of the Court of Cassation. The bureau for legal aid is headed by one of the judges of the Court, assisted by a clerk. The judge of the bureau will ask the opinion of an advocate-general on all requests. If the request is deemed to be admissible, the judge will also ask the opinion of one of the attorneys at the Court regarding the chances of success of any proceedings. Legal aid will only be granted if the requester is sufficiently indigent, and if the proceedings have a reasonable chance of success. Legal aid consists of the total or partial waiving of court fees and the waiving of attorney's fees for the interventions of an attorney at the Court that are mandatory by law.  Kind of hearing   Three chambers  Most cases and matters brought before the Court of Cassation are heard by one of the Court's three chambers. The Belgian Judicial Code lays down by which of the three chambers a case ought to be heard, depending on its nature: * The first chamber hears appeals in cassation against judgments and rulings in civil and commercial cases; * The second chamber hears appeals in cassation against judgments and rulings in criminal cases; * The third chamber hears appeals in cassation against judgments and rulings in social (labour and social protection) cases. Other cases (cases involving fiscal law, administrative law, or disciplinary rulings by some professional bodies) are divided over the chambers by the first president of the Court. In practice, most of these cases are heard by the first chamber. The first president may also at any time, whenever the needs of the Court require so, refer cases to another chamber than the one before which they normally ought to be heard. Cases are heard by either the Dutch or French section of each chamber depending on the language of the proceedings.  Specific hearings and assemblies  However, the first president may require cases to be heard in \\"full bench\\" or \\"plenary hearing\\" (, , ), upon the opinion of the prosecutor-general's office and the judge-rapporteur. This means that the Dutch and French sections of the chamber will hold a joint session to hear the case. This usually pertains to cases where different interpretations of the law may exist between the two sections of a chamber. In this manner, hearing cases in full bench is meant to promote the uniform interpretation of the law by both sections. The law also prescribes that some cases must be heard by the Court in \\"joint chambers\\" or \\"full court\\" (, , ). This means that the judges of multiple chambers will hold a joint session to hear the case. The instances for which the law requires such a hearing in joint chambers are fairly uncommon. Cases required to be heard in this manner include jurisdictional conflicts between administrative and judicial courts, and appeals in cassation against a judgment handed down in a criminal case against a minister of the federal government or one of the regional governments of Belgium. The broadest manner in which the Court can convene, is in \\"general assembly\\" (, , ). The Court does not convene in general assembly to adjudicate cases; the general assembly only handles certain matters of an internal nature. The prerogatives of the general assembly of the Court include, amongst other things: initiating disciplinary proceedings against the first president of the Court, appointing the president and section presidents of the Court, providing an opinion on candidates for the office of judge at the Court to the federal minister of Justice of Belgium, and drawing up the annual report of the Court. A sole exception are any disciplinary proceedings against members of the Council of State, on which the Court of Cassation must decide in general assembly.  Number of judges  The number of judges which must hear cases in the different configurations of the Court, is laid down in the Belgian Judicial Code. To prevent deadlocks, cases are always heard by an uneven number of judges. By default, a case is heard by one of the two sections of a chamber, which sits with five judges. If a case is heard in full bench (by both sections of a chamber), the chamber will sit with nine judges. In principle, all judges of the Court can sit in hearings in joint chambers, but the number of judges hearing cases in joint chambers must be at least eleven. If the Court convenes in general assembly, an absolute majority of its thirty judges must be present to be able to take any decision. If this quorum for a general assembly is not met, the assembly will be adjourned to a later date. If at a later date the quorum is still not met for an adjourned general assembly, the assembly may take decisions without the quorum being met. However, the first president or the section president may, upon the opinion of the prosecutor-general's office and the judge-rapporteur, order a case to be heard by only three judges of a section of a chamber. Before 2014, this was only permitted if the outcome of the case appeared to be obvious. After a 2014 amendment, the scope of such hearings with a limited number of judges was broadened to all cases where it appeared an answer to important questions of law, in the interest of the uniform interpretation or the evolution of the law, was not needed. This limited panel of judges must decide on the case unanimously. If the three judges cannot reach a unanimous decision, or if one of them requests it, the case must be referred to the full section of the chamber to be heard by five judges.  Process of an appeal in cassation   Petition  In criminal cases, a petition to initiate cassation proceedings needs to be submitted to the clerk's office of the court or tribunal that rendered the contested decision. Prison inmates or people who have been institutionalized in a psychiatric facility may also submit their petition to the director of the establishment. The petition will then be transmitted to the clerk's office of the Court of Cassation. In criminal cases, the petition needs to submitted within fifteen days after the contested decision was rendered, save for some exceptions. The petition needs to be signed by an attorney with a special certificate (as explained above). If the petition (also) targets a decision on civil damages to a civil party involved in the criminal proceedings, a writ of the petition also needs to be served to the civil party by a court bailiff. It is a feature of the Belgian judicial system in general, that the courts and tribunals which have jurisdiction over criminal cases, will also decide on any civil damages sought by a victim who is a civil party to the case. In non-criminal (civil, commercial, ...) cases, the petition needs to be submitted directly to the clerk's office of the Court of Cassation. In these cases, the petition needs to be submitted within three months after the contested decision was rendered, save for some exceptions. The petition also needs to be signed by an attorney at the Court except in fiscal cases (as explained above). A writ of the petition needs to be served to the defendant by a court bailiff. The petition must be drawn up in the language of the contested decision, which will determine by which section of a chamber the case will be heard. If the contested decision is in German, the claimant can choose to draw up the petition in any of the three languages of Belgium (either Dutch, French or German).  Written pleadings  In criminal cases, the claimant can submit written pleadings (, , ) to elaborate on the initial petition. These pleadings must be submitted to the clerk's office at least fifteen days before the hearing is scheduled, and at least two months after the initial petition was submitted. They must also be served to the civil party (if applicable). The civil party can submit written pleadings as a response at least eight days before the hearing is scheduled, and must serve these to the claimant. All of the aforementioned pleadings need to be signed by an attorney with a special certificate (as explained above). In non- criminal cases, the claimant can submit written pleadings to elaborate on the initial petition, which must be submitted to the clerk's office within fifteen days after the petition was submitted. These pleadings must also be served to the defendant. The defendant can submit written pleadings as a response within three months after the initial petition or pleadings of the claimant have been served to them. If the defendant raises a cause for non-admissibility, the defendant's pleadings also need to be served to the claimant. In that case, the claimant may submit additional pleadings as a reaction within one month, and needs to serve these to the defendant as well. All of the aforementioned pleadings need to be signed by an attorney at the Court, except for fiscal cases (as explained above). In exceptional cases, the aforementioned terms may also be shortened by the first president of the Court.  Preliminary examination  After the petition and written pleadings have been submitted, the first president of the Court designates one of the judges who will hear the case as judge-rapporteur (, , ). The judge-rapporteur will examine the case and prepare a preliminary report. The case will also be presented to the prosecutor-general's office, to be examined by the prosecutor-general or one of the advocates-general. The prosecutor-general or advocate-general will prepare an advisory opinion on the case. If they intend to ex officio raise a cause of non-admissibility in non-criminal cases, they must inform the parties of such before the hearing. In criminal cases, the section president of the section that would hear the case, can since 2014 summarily rule to reject the appeal in cassation if the prosecutor-general's office also advises as such. This can only be the case if the appeal in cassation is non-admissible; for example if the term limit to submit a petition has been exceeded, if the petition has not been signed by a proper attorney, or if the claimant does not stipulate any irregularity or cause for nullity that could lead to cassation. The section president will issue such a ruling of non-admissibility without a public hearing and without considering any arguments from the claimant. The claimant involved will be informed of such a ruling and be provided with the brief reasons for the rejection. There is no recourse against such a ruling.  Hearing and ruling  After the preliminary examination and if the case was not ruled inadmissible (only criminal cases), the Court will hold a public hearing on the scheduled day where all the required judges are present. The parties involved are not required to be present, but can be if they wish so. First the preliminary report will be presented by the judge-rapporteur; then the prosecutor-general or advocate-general may give his advisory opinion orally. This advisory opinion may also be given in writing in addition. In general, the parties involved do not present any oral arguments at the hearing, as their arguments already have been submitted in writing prior to the hearing. If present however, the attorneys at the Court are permitted to bring oral arguments forward in response to the opinion of the prosecutor- general or advocate-general. After these pleas, the judges will retreat and deliberate. During the hearing, the judges are assisted by a clerk. If the Court of Cassation deems it necessary, it will request a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice or the Benelux Court of Justice regarding the interpretation of respectively European Union law or Benelux law. The Court of Cassation may also request the Belgian Constitutional Court to rule on the constitutionality of a law or legal provision with regards to the Belgian Constitution, if such is questioned in a case before it. The Court of Cassation will stay the case before it until the European Court of Justice, the Benelux Court of Justice or the Constitutional Court has issued the requested ruling. The judges usually decide on their ruling the same day or shortly after the hearing. The rulings decided on by the judges are pronounced in open court by the section president, in the presence of the prosecutor- general or advocate-general. The parties involved are not required to be present, but can be if they wish so. In its ruling, the Court will only answer to the arguments brought forward or questions of law raised by the parties involved. If no arguments are brought forward as to why the contested decision needs to be annulled, the Court will declare the case to be non-admissible and dismiss it. In criminal cases however, the Court will also verify ex officio whether the contested decision was issued in a regular manner and respected the formalities prescribed under penalty of nullity. The Court will thus either rule the case to be non-admissible and dismiss it; either reject the appeal in cassation; or either annul the contested decision partially or wholly (cassation), in which case it will either remit the case to the appropriate court for a retrial or either pronounce a cassation without referral (as explained above).  Aspects of the rulings of the Court of Cassation   No case selection  The Court of Cassation does not have discretionary power to select the cases it hears. There is no writ of certiorari or other prior approval required to initiate a case before the Court. As such, the Court of Cassation is required to hear all appeals in cassation that are correctly brought before it. However, the mandatory intervention of an attorney at the Court in all non-criminal and non-fiscal cases, and the mandatory intervention of an attorney with a special certificate in criminal cases, is meant to discourage people from initiating frivolous and ill-considered proceedings nonetheless. The aforementioned attorneys form a kind of extrajudicial filter to help reduce the Court's caseload. As described in other parts of this article, additional measures to reduce the caseload of the Court have been introduced over the last years as well. This for example concerns: * The possibility to have simple cases heard by a limited panel of only three judges (since 2014); * The possibility for the section president to summarily dismiss non-admissible criminal cases (since 2014); * The abolishment of \\"double cassation\\", where a ruling of the Court was only binding for a lower court after a second cassation on the same grounds, in favour of the Court's rulings being immediately binding for a lower court (since 2017).  No individual opinions  The Court always issues one single ruling on a case before it, which represents the (majority) opinion of the Court. The Court does not have a tradition of dissenting opinions or concurring opinions since the deliberations of the judges are in principle secret. The individual opinions of the judges regarding the Court's rulings are thus not publicly known. Moreover, the Court of Cassation has ruled that any violation of the secrecy of deliberations of judges can be punished under article 458 of the Belgian Penal Code, which penalizes violations of professional secrecy requirements.  No binding case law By virtue of Article 6 of the Belgian Judicial Code, no Belgian court may issue a ruling that amounts to a generally binding rule, as that is considered the purview of the legislative power. As a consequence, the rulings of the Court of Cassation only ever apply to the case at hand, and do not have the value of stare decisis. This means that the Court's rulings are not formally binding for lower courts in a general sense, and thus do not create case law in an official sense. However, the Court's rulings have an important persuasive value for lower courts, since the Court is likely to annul any lower court judgment conflicting with one of its earlier rulings. The most persuasive form of precedent by the Court is the jurisprudence constante, which follows from a series of rulings in which a particular principle or rule was applied in a likewise manner by the Court. Although the Court itself aims to adhere to its own precedents, peculiar and extraordinary circumstances may nonetheless compel the Court to depart from its prior precedents. This way, the Court ensures the evolution of the law in conjunction with the evolution of the rest of society. This principle does not apply to a court to which the Court of Cassation has referred a case for retrial after a judgment was annulled. After a 2017 amendment, Article 1110 of the Belgian Judicial Code and Article 435 of the Belgian Code of Criminal Procedure oblige any such court to adhere to the ruling of the Court of Cassation with regards to the points of law on which it ruled. Before 2017, any court retrying a case referred to it by the Court of Cassation was not formally bound by the Court's ruling. This could result in the judgment following the retrial being appealed to the Court again. In this event, the case was to be heard by the Court in joint chambers. If the Court would then annul the judgment again on the same grounds as the first time, the case would again be remitted to a different court for a retrial. Only this time, the court in question would be bound by the ruling of the Court of Cassation with regards to the points of law on which it ruled.  No constitutional review  The Belgian Constitution, at its adoption in 1831, did not contain any provision either allowing or either prohibiting the Belgian judiciary to engage in the constitutional review of legislative acts. In a ruling rendered on 23 July 1849, the Court of Cassation ruled for the first time on the topic that the Belgian judiciary, including the Court itself, cannot review the constitutionality of legislative acts. The Court considered that reviewing or considering the constitutionality of legislative acts is the sovereign purview of the legislature. The Court has since not deviated from this point of view, and has reaffirmed it in a number of subsequent rulings. The Court has however tested the limits of this legal doctrine in for example its \\"Waleffe\\" ruling (see further below). In the 1980s, the Constitutional Court of Belgium (originally named as \\"Court of Arbitration\\") was founded as a result of the federalisation of Belgium. This court has since been awarded the power to review the constitutionality of legislative acts with regards to the division of powers over the federal and regional levels of government, and with regards to constitutional rights. Since then, all courts and tribunals of the Belgian judiciary (including the Court of Cassation), whilst still not reviewing the constitutionality of legislative acts themselves, can ask prejudicial questions to the Constitutional Court. If as a result the Constitutional Court nullifies an unconstitutional legislative act or legislative provision, the requesting court will leave aside the nullified act or provision.  Notable rulings of the Court of Cassation  * \\"Flandria\\" ruling: In this ruling rendered on 5 November 1920, the Court stated that the Belgian State could be held liable for a tort like any other private individual, based on article 1382 of the Belgian Civil Code. The ruling was rendered in a case concerning a badly constructed public road that had caused damage to an adjacent property. The ruling ended the previously presumed sovereign immunity from civil liability of the Belgian State. * \\"Waleffe\\" ruling: In this ruling rendered on 20 April 1950, the Court established the presumption of constitutionality. According to this legal doctrine laid down by the Court, whenever confronted with an ambiguous legislative act that could be interpreted in both a manner that would violate the Belgian Constitution and in a manner that would be in conformity with the Belgian Constitution, Belgian judges must assume the legislature did not intend to violate the Constitution and must thus choose the interpretation that is in conformity with the Constitution. * \\"Franco- Suisse Le Ski\\" ruling: In this ruling rendered on 27 May 1971, the Court confirmed the primacy of self-executing international treaties over domestic laws in case of conflicts between both; and more specifically the primacy of European Union law over any domestic law. This principle, espousing a monistic approach, even stands when the conflicting domestic law was adopted after the treaty entered into force. The cause for the ruling was a tax dispute involving the Belgian cheese company Franco-Suisse Le Ski, which stemmed from import tariffs on dairy products that had been recently approved by Belgian authorities but were later found to be in violation of the EEC Treaty. * \\"Spaghetti\\" ruling: In this ruling rendered on 14 October 1996, the Court disqualified the investigative judge Jean-Marc Connerotte from the Dutroux case for allegations of bias, because he had attended fundraising dinner for the victims in the case where he also received a small gift. The disqualification and subsequent replacement of the investigative judge in the extremely sensitive Dutroux case caused national outcry, and was one of the main factors leading up to the so-called \\"White March\\". This was a demonstration in Brussels of about 300,000 people who demanded better protection for children and a better functioning justice system. * \\"Antigone\\" ruling: In this ruling rendered on 14 October 2003, the Court reduced the scope of the exclusionary principle regarding unlawfully obtained evidence in criminal cases. Until then, the Belgian judiciary had generally adhered to the principle that unlawfully obtained evidence is inadmissible and must be excluded from the criminal proceedings and the consideration of the judge(s), even though such a remedy was not explicitly provided for in Belgian law. The Court of Cassation ruled that unlawfully obtained evidence must only be excluded if its reliability was affected, if the use of the evidence would be an explicit cause of nullity as provided for by law, or if the use of the evidence would be in violation of the right to a fair trial. The cause for the ruling was the conviction of a man for illegally possessing a firearm, which was discovered during a police search later held to be unlawful. The police search was part of a coordinated police operation in the city of Antwerp under the code name \\"Antigone\\". This important case law was later codified as such into the \\"Preliminary title\\" of the Belgian Code of Criminal Procedure.  Applicable legislation  Most of the legal provisions that establish the structure, jurisdiction and procedure of the Court of Cassation, can be found in the Belgian Judicial Code: * Part II, Book I, Title I, Chapter V of the Code defines the structure and subdivisions of the Court; * Part III, Title I, Chapter V of the Code defines the jurisdiction of the Court; * Part IV, Book III, Title IV of the Code defines the procedural rules for cassation proceedings in non-criminal (civil, commercial, ...) cases. * Part IV, Book III, Title IVbis of the Code defines some specific rules for cassation proceedings in disciplinary cases. However, the Belgian Code of Criminal Procedure defines the procedural rules for cassation proceedings in criminal cases. The provisions regarding prejudicial questions to the Court of Cassation on the topic of competition law, are laid down in the Belgian Code of Economic Law.  Statistics   Caseload  According to its annual report, a total of 2,522 new cases were brought before the Court of Cassation in 2019, of which 1,386 were cases in the Dutch language and 1,136 were in the French language. The number of cases still pending at the end of 2019 stood at 2,008. In 2019, the Court also issued 2,420 final decisions in cases pending before it, which were therefore closed (as far as concerns the Court of Cassation at least). When looking at the preceding years, one can observe that the number of new cases in 2019 has risen slightly compared to 2018, but is still significantly lower than in 2011 (3,583 new cases). The number of rulings issued in 2019 however stands at the lowest in recent years. In its report, the Court itself attributes this to shortages in support personnel, the resignation of seven magistrates (judges and members of the prosecutor's office) from the Court, and the burdensome appointment procedure to replace them.  Nature of the cases  The Court's 2019 annual report also contains statistics about the nature of the cases brought before it. Of the 2,522 new cases brought before the Court in 2019, 1,348 were criminal cases, 658 were civil and commercial cases, 170 were fiscal cases, 92 were social cases (involving labour or social protection law), 16 were disciplinary cases (concerning decisions taken by some professional bodies), and 238 cases were requests for legal aid in proceedings before the Court. Of the aforementioned cases: * 12 concerned requests to disqualify a judge or court in a lower court case, and refer the case to a different judge or court, that were granted by the Court; * 2 concerned matters that were heard and ruled upon by a chamber of the Court in full bench; * 2 concerned matters that were heard and ruled upon by the Court in joint chambers. In 2019, no prejudicial questions had been asked to the Court of Cassation.  Outcome of the cases  The Court's 2019 annual reports provides (rounded-up) statistics on the outcome of adjudicated cases as well. Of all the cases the Court ruled on in 2019, 54% resulted in the rejection of the appeal in cassation and 22% resulted in a cassation (meaning an entire or partial annulment of the contested judgment or ruling). In addition, 11% of the cases resulted in a summary ruling of non- admissibility (only criminal cases), 6% of the cases concerned the rejection of a request for legal aid, 3% concerned the granting of legal aid, 3% of the cases were abandoned by the claimant before a final decision, and 1% concerned the disqualification of a judge in a lower court case. There exists a non- negligible difference between criminal and non-criminal cases regarding the chances of success of an appeal in cassation: whilst 41% of the non-criminal cases resulted in a cassation, only 14% of the criminal cases resulted in a cassation as well.  Trivia  * At the beginning of each \\"judicial year\\" (, , ) on the 1st of September, the Court of Cassation holds a ceremonial session with all of the magistrates (judges and prosecutors) of the Court, where the prosecutor-general will hold an oration, usually on a legal topic. This oration is known as a \\"mercurial\\" (, , ). During the ceremony, the magistrates wear their ceremonial attire. * The ceremonial attire of the magistrates of the Court consists of a red court dress and white jabot. In addition, the ceremonial dresses of the first president of the Court and of the prosecutor- general are lined with ermine. The magistrates may wear any decorations or medals awarded to them on their court dresses. These dresses are only worn on ceremonial occasions; during normal hearings the judges and prosecutors wear a simple black court dress with white jabot and red girdle. Both their ceremonial and usual court attire are prescribed by the law. * Each year in October, the prosecutor-general at the Court must submit a report to the Belgian Federal Parliament, listing all of the laws or legal provisions that caused problems during the last judicial year. This concerns laws and legal provisions that turned out to be difficult to interpret or apply by the courts and tribunals of Belgium. This report is meant to allow legislators to correct or improve defective, ambiguous or otherwise problematic legislation. * Most rulings of the Court of Cassation, as well as some of the advisory opinions given by the prosecutor-general's office, are bundled and published yearly as a reference work. The Dutch-language rulings are published in the Arresten van het Hof van Cassatie, the French-language rulings in the Pasicrisie belge. * The Court of Cassation of Belgium is a member of the ' (abbreviated as AHJUCAF), which is an organisation founded in 2001 that encompasses around fifty supreme courts from primarily or partially French-speaking nations. The organisation aims to promote the cooperation and the exchange of ideas between the participating supreme courts.

Historical combat maneuver Illustration of the historical maneuver from a 1918 flight manual In World War I aerial combat, Wood, Alan C. and Sutton, Alan, \\"Military Aviation Of The First World War\\", Fonthill Media Press, 2016, page 10 an Immelmann turn (named for the German air ace Max Immelmann) was a maneuver used after an attack on another aircraft to reposition the attacking aircraft for another attack. After making a high-speed diving attack on an enemy, the attacker would then climb back up past the enemy aircraft, and just short of the stall, apply full rudder to yaw his aircraft around.McMinnies, W.G., 1918, p. 194. This put his aircraft facing down at the enemy aircraft, making another high-speed diving pass possible. This is a difficult maneuver to perform properly, as it involves precise control of the aircraft at low speed. With practice and proper use of all of the fighter's controls, the maneuver could be used to reposition the attacking aircraft to dive back down in any direction desired. In modern aerobatics, this maneuver, if executed pre-stall with a non-zero turning radius at the top of the climb, is known as a wingover. If the rudder turn is executed right at the initiation of the stall, the resulting yaw occurs around a point within the aircraft's wingspan and the maneuver is known as a stall turn or hammerhead. Aerobatic maneuver Schematic view of an Immelmann turn: The aerobatic Immelmann turn derives its name from the dogfighting tactic, but is a different maneuver than the original, now known as a \\"wingover\\" or \\"hammerhead\\". In modern aerobatics, an Immelmann turn (also known as a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic maneuver. Essentially, it comprises an ascending half-loop followed by a half-roll, resulting in level flight in the opposite direction at a higher altitude. It is the opposite of a Split S, which involves a half- roll followed by a half-loop, resulting in level flight in the opposite direction at a lower altitude. To successfully execute a roll-off-the-top turn, the pilot accelerates to sufficient airspeed to perform a loop in the aircraft. The pilot then pulls the aircraft into a climb, and continues to pull back on the controls as the aircraft climbs. Rudder and ailerons must be used to keep the half-loop straight when viewed from the ground. As the aircraft passes over the point at which the climb was commenced, it should be inverted and a half loop will have been executed. Sufficient airspeed must be maintained to recover without losing altitude, and at the top of the loop the pilot then executes a half-roll to regain normal upright aircraft orientation. As a result, the aircraft is now at a higher altitude and has changed course 180 degrees. Not all aircraft are capable of (or certified for) this maneuver, due to insufficient engine power, or engine design that precludes flying inverted. (This usually applies to piston engines that have an open oil pan. However, when properly flown, the aircraft will maintain positive G throughout the maneuver, eliminating the requirement for an inverted oil system.) In fact, few early aircraft had sufficiently precise roll control to have performed this maneuver properly.Wheeler (1965) pp. 68-71 See also * Chandelle * The Scissors * Cuban Eight * Split S * Thach Weave References *The \\"Immelman\\" Turn Bibliography *McMinnies, W.G., Practical Flying: Complete Course of Flying Instruction, London, Temple Press, 1918 (Facsimile Edition, Empire, 1997) *Wheeler, Allan H, Building Aeroplanes for \\"Those Magnificent Men\\", London, Foulis, 1963 Category:Aerial maneuvers ","title":"Immelmann turn"},{"id":"4528663","text":"Monster Rancher EVO ( in Japan) is a PlayStation 2 game in the Monster Rancher series. It was released in Japan on December 8, 2005, and in North America on April 13, 2006. The game was not released in PAL territories. Gameplay Monster Rancher EVO delves more into the RPG genre than previous installments in the series. Gamers play the role of Julio, a circus performer who aspires to be a world class monster breeder. Players must meet with the circus ringleader on a weekly basis to plan out the next week's course of action: schedule in circus performances, adventuring and training for their monsters. Although the series has taken a new direction, Monster Rancher EVO features many of the themes of past games. Monster generation (using CD/DVDs, an in- game item, or with other monsters) is done with a female shaman named Nayuta who also plays the role of heroine. Rather than using a shrine to unlock your disks, Nayuta awakens them using a magical monster rebirth dance. She can reseal them in disc stones as well, which replaces the freeze function from older games. While this does not affect monster health it does affect loyalty; over-use can lead to monsters rebelling in the middle of a show. There is a Monster Market where players can pick up disc stones for free, in case they lack a large collection of their own disks. Monsters can be combined like previous games, but the parent monsters are not consumed, and are put back in Julio's inventory afterwards. Many monster species make a return, with a few new additions as well, for a total of 25 main breeds. Monsters put on shows using training gadgets, and if the audience enjoys the show, they will throw money at the stage. Exploration, similar to that of Monster Rancher 4, involves the character going out into the field with his or her monster(s), and defeating stray monsters and a chapter boss to gain anima points, used to gain new monster skills or perform 'union attacks'. Graphics Monster Rancher EVO's artwork style is a great deal more animated and realistic than its predecessors. Characters take on a much more realistic physique and appear quite natural, rather than cartoony. Monsters in EVO share most of the same design as those from Monster Rancher 4. They are more smoothly animated, helping to immerse the player fully into the game. Story The Orcoro Circus is a band of people who have come together to bring joy to people's faces. Julio, a young boy in the Orcoro circus, wants to be a professional and famous Monster Breeder. One day after a performance a mysterious beautiful girl with special powers by the name of Nayuta came to force her way into the circus troop. NPC interaction is the key to moving forward in the story. Each of the seven towns that you visit has its own problems. In each village there is a guild. At the guild Julio accepts missions from the guildmaster that have been set by the villagers. The rewards for missions are gold, items, and rare monsters. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, one eight, and two sevens for a total of 29 out of 40.

Formed in 1960 following a review of military formations in Australia, the Regiment can trace its lineage back the late 19th Century and has served Australia in a number of conflicts including the Boer War, World War I and World War II. Today it serves as a part of the Australian Army's 9th Brigade, 2nd Division. History The Royal Tasmania Regiment was formed in 1960 as part of the reforms that saw the old Citizens Military Force reorganised along pentropic lines into what is now known as the Army Reserve. As part of this reform, Tasmania's two single- battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated, to form the Royal Tasmania Regiment. These two parent regiments were: *12th Infantry Battalion (The Launceston Regiment) *40th Infantry Battalion (The Derwent Regiment) The two battalions were reduced to companies within a single battalion named as the Tasmania Regiment. The regiment was given its royal title the same year. In 1972, the RTR expanded to two battalions, when both the 12th and 40th were reformed. However, this lasted only until 1975, when it was again reduced, this time to a pair of independent rifle companies, 12th IRC and 40th IRC. Then, in November 1987, the regiment was expanded to a full battalion again through the regimentation of the two independent rifle companies, 12 Field Squadron Royal Australian Engineers, 146 Signal Squadron and 6 Intelligence Unit, forming as 12th/40th Battalion. Lineage The Regiment's lineage can be traced back to 1878 when the Tasmanian Volunteer Rifle Regiment was formed in Tasmania with four companies in Hobart and two in Launceston.http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/8775685 The current Regiment has evolved since that time, albeit under a variety of titles and organisations. The Tasmanian Rifle Regiment of Southern Tasmania, the Launceston Rifle Regiment of Northern Tasmania and an Auxiliary Force (Enrolled Pensioner Forcehttp://users.highway1.com.au/~miklruss/The_Enrolled_Pensioner_Force/the_enrolled_pensioner_force.html) were combined as the three battalions of the Tasmania Volunteer Rifle Regiment in 1897.http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/REL/18395.001 These were: 1st Battalion, Tasmania Infantry Regiment which was formed in the south, the 2nd Battalion TIR which was formed in the north and the 3rd Battalion TIR which was formed in the north-west. In 1899 the first contingent of Tasmanians departed for the Second Boer War. During this conflict, two men of the 1st Tasmanian Imperial Bushmen had the distinction of earning the first Victoria Crosses (VC) to be awarded to Australian infantrymen.PTE John Bisdee and LT Guy Wylly received their VCs for the same action near Warm Bad, on 1 September 1900. See The Sunday Mail 25 April 1993, p. 61 For this campaign and the contingents that followed afterwards, the Regiment holds the Battle Honours of 'South Africa 1899‚Äì1902' and '1900‚Äì1902'. Following Federation, the titles of the battalions were changed; in the south to the Derwent Infantry Regiment (Derwent Regiment), in the north to the 12th Infantry Regiment (Launceston Regiment) and in the North-West to the Tasmanian Rangers. During World War I the 12th and 40th Battalions were raised as part of the Australian Imperial Force and these units went on to serve with considerable distinction overseas. Their sacrifice earned the two Battalions three Theatre Honours and 25 Battle Honours, which continue to be held by the Regiment to this day. After the war the two Battalions were demobilised and reformed as Militia units. At the outbreak of World War II the 2nd Australian Imperial Force was formed and as part of this the 2/12th and 2/40th Battalions were raised (distinct from the militia battalions that had the same numerical designation). These battalions were also deployed for overseas service, and during the course of the war, they earned two Theatre Honours, a Campaign Honour and 13 Battle Honours. Of note, the 2/12th Battalion fought during the Defence of Tobruk, and later at Milne Bay. The 2/40th Battalion gave also distinguished service, serving in Timor as part of the ill-fated Sparrow Force where, surrounded and outnumbered, they mounted a spirited defence against the Japanese but were ultimately forced to surrender in February 1942.Thompson, pp. 259‚Äì260 During World War II, the militia battalions formed at the end of the World War I from units of the original AIF were maintained as separate units from the battalions raised as part of the 2nd AIF. The 12th/50th Battalion was the direct descendant of the 12th Battalion, AIF, and during the war it served as part of York Force and on garrison duties in the Northern Territory. At the same time, the 40th Battalion also served in Darwin. On 2 May 1945 the 12th/50th Battalion was amalgamated with the 40th Battalion and became the 12th/40th Battalion. This Battalion formed the bulk of Timor Force that accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces from the commander of the 48th Japanese Division at Koepang on 3 October 1945. In March 1946, it returned to Australia and was subsequently disbanded on 29 May 1946. On 1 July 1948 the 12th/40th Battalion was raised again as part of the Citizen Military Forces. On 30 June 1951 this Battalion was separated and became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, The Tasmania Regiment. On 1 July 1960, The Tasmania Regiment was granted the Royal prefix and became The Royal Tasmania Regiment. Royal Tasmania Regiment today The 12th/40th Battalion, The Royal Tasmania Regiment, is part of 9 Brigade, with battalion headquarters at Anglesea Barracks, Hobart, Alpha Company based in Launceston and Bravo Company is based in Hobart. The battalion serves in the light infantry role as part of 2 Division, Australia's main home defence formation. The unit is proud of its history within the 9th Brigade and 2nd Division for performing at a consistently high standard. This is supported by successes in past years in 9th Brigade and 2nd Division military skills competitions and strong showings on major Brigade activities. The participation rate of soldiers within major exercises is as high as any other unit and better than many other Army Reserve units nationally. Today the soldiers and officers of the 12th/40th Battalion have served overseas in the Solomon Islands under Operation Anode, Timor Leste under Operation Astute, Iraq and the Middle East under Operation Catalyst and Afghanistan under Operation Slipper as part of larger contingents. The battalion wears a blue and black lanyard, which comes from its links to the 12th and 40th Battalions. However, the unit's colour patch is that of the 12th Battalion, 1st Australian Imperial Force, which is white over sky blue. The regiment holds the colours of both the 12th and 40th Battalions.

She won an Olympic gold medal in the 400 m individual medley at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, and set five world records in swimming. She was named by Swimming World magazine as World Swimmer of the Year in 1980 and 1982, but her achievements are regarded with suspicion due to the state-run systematic doping program run by East Germany. She later admitted to having been doped. In 2005, she called for her last remaining record (German national record in the 400 m individual medley) to be struck from the record books, because it was achieved with the aid of steroids. Schneider came to prominence at the 1978 World Championships in Berlin, winning bronze in the 400 m individual medley behind arch-rival Tracy Caulkins of the United States with whom she shares the same birthday. Thereafter, she never lost to Caulkins again, repeatedly lowering Caulkins' world record in the event, three times in 1980 from 4:40.83 to 4:36.29 at the Moscow Olympics, which was boycotted by the United States. She improved her record to 4:36.10 at Guayaquil in 1982 and it was not bettered until 1997. Schneider's victory in the 400 m event left silver medallist Sharron Davies of the United Kingdom 10 seconds in arrears. This particular victory, however, has been proven to be fraudulent as Schneider later admitted to doping as part of the Stasi era's drugs program wherein many female athletes were put on testosterone to enhance their outcome. She also held the world record in the 200 m individual medley, but was denied a gold medal as the event was canceled for the 1980 games. She also collected a silver medal in the 400 m freestyle. She repeated her haul at the 1982 World Championships in Ecuador, winning the medley double and a silver in the 400 m freestyle. She also won three European Championships medals and set eight European records. She was also named by Swimming World as the European Swimmer of the Year in 1979 and 1980. However, her Olympic career was ended when the Soviet bloc, including East Germany, staged a retaliatory boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. Schneider attributed her success in swimming (prior to admissions of doping) with the quote > For me swimming is the most beautiful of all sports. Although I have been > training for very many years and have taken part in a great number of > competitions, I always find something new in this sport. And this I'm sure > is greatly to the credit of my coach, Eberhard Mothes, who takes my training > sessions at the sport club in Karl-Marx-Stadt and never fails to come up > with something interesting or challenging in the course of the work.

The Waterguard was a division of HM Customs and Excise (HMCE) responsible for the control of vessels, aircraft, vehicles and persons arriving into and departing from the United Kingdom. This included crew members and passengers, as well as persons travelling on foot. Waterguard officers were responsible for applying the allowances provided for in law and for collection of customs and excise revenue on the excess. The officers were also responsible for the enforcement of the prohibitions and restrictions, including controlled drugs and plant and animal health. With the reorganization of HM Customs and Excise in 1972 the Waterguard was renamed the 'Preventive Service' and the functions of the Waterguard continued to be carried out as part of the HMCE (and its successor HM Revenue and Customs) until the establishment of the UK Border Agency in 2008. History Formed in 1809 as the \\"Preventive Waterguard\\" (also known as the Preventive Boat ServiceHouse of Commons Sessional Papers 1819 (569) XVII, 77; \\"A Return of Officers and Men appointed to the Preventive Boat Service between November 1816 and March 1819\\") to combat smuggling, the Waterguard was an independent arm of revenue enforcement and complemented the \\"riding officers\\" (stationed along the south coast of England) who patrolled the shore on horseback, and the offshore revenue cutters (which were owned and operated by both the Board of Customs and the Board of Excise). The Waterguard was initially based in Watch Houses around the coast, and boat crews patrolled inshore waters around the coast in small boats each night. It was placed under Admiralty control from 1816 to 1822, when it and the riding officers and cutters were amalgamated under the control of HM Customs and renamed the Coast Guard (itself placed under Admiralty control in 1856). With the Coast Guard having moved away from preventive work in the years that followed, the Waterguard was re-formed as part of HM Customs in 1891 and absorbed into the Customs and Excise department in 1909. The name \\"Waterguard\\" became misleading after 1923, when their domain was extended to the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland), and they also came to carry out controls at airports and other places of entry into the United Kingdom. Waterguard officers were often referred to simply as \\"customs officers\\", although until 1972 Officers of Customs and Excise were non-uniformed, the outdoor service, and were responsible for the examination and clearance of cargo (rather than passengers), as well as control of Purchase Tax. When Purchase Tax was replaced by VAT, control of this tax became the responsibility of HM Customs and Excise.

It is now in storage at Statens historiska museum in Stockholm. The stave church has been replaced by a stone church, which was finished in the 13th century. During a renovation of this church in the late 19th century, parts of the stave church were discovered, because the wood pieces of the stave church had been reused for building the floor of the current church.

She wrote more than 20 books and had a worldwide reputation as a passionate and committed advocate for change.  Life and work  Kitzinger was born in Taunton, Somerset. She was a social anthropologist specialising in pregnancy, childbirth and the parenting of babies and young children. She campaigned for women to have the information they need to make choices about childbirth and was a well known advocate for breastfeeding. She joined the advisory board of the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) in 1958 as a teacher and trainer. A baby feeding. A home birth. She held academic posts at the University of Edinburgh and the Open University, and was an honorary professor at the University of West London, where she taught the MA in midwifery in the Wolfson School of Health Sciences. She also taught workshops on the social anthropology of birth and breastfeeding. She wrote many articles and books and was active in midwifery education in the UK and internationally. She lectured widely in the USA and Canada, the Caribbean, Israel, Australia, Latin America, South Africa and Japan and worked as a consultant to the International Childbirth Education Association. She was a strong believer that all women who are not at high risk should be given the choice of a home birth. Her books cover women's experiences of breastfeeding, antenatal care, birth plans, induction of labour, epidurals, episiotomy, hospital care in childbirth, children's experiences of being present at birth and post traumatic stress following childbirth. Some of her writing was controversial for its time; The Good Birth Guide (1979) may have caused a rift in her relationship with the NCT and she was often at odds with radical feminist views. Her work is considered influential in changing the culture in which women give birth She believed that: \\"Birth is a major life transition. It is ‚Äì must be ‚Äì also a political issue, in terms of the power of the medical system, how it exercises control over women and whether it enables them to make decisions about their own bodies and their babies.\\" She was awarded an MBE in 1982 in recognition of her services to education for childbirth.

He served as the general manager of the New York Giants from 1979 to 1997. He was named NFL Executive of the Year five times. Early life Young was born on September 22, 1930 in Baltimore, Maryland. Young grew up in Baltimore's 10th Ward (east Baltimore) in a tough Irish-Catholic neighborhood, living over a bakery that was run by his mother's side of the family, just across the street from his father's bar. He was an outstanding football player at Calvert Hall College, a Catholic high school then located in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Bucknell University, where he was a starting defensive tackle for three seasons, team captain in 1951, and a member of the Phi Lambda Theta fraternity. He was named to the Little All- America first team and All-East first team in his senior year. Selected to play in the BlueGray game, he was selected by the Dallas Texans in the 1952 NFL Draft. Young then began a coaching career in the Baltimore area school system, briefly at Calvert Hall and then he took over the Baltimore City College football team. During a 15-year span, his teams won six Maryland Scholastic Association championships. Tom Gatewood, tight end,Tom Gatewood Past Stats, Statistics, History, and Awards - databaseFootball.com and John Sykes, running back,John Sykes Past Stats, Statistics, History, and Awards - databaseFootball.com were two of Coach Young's City athletes who would make it to the NFL, Kurt Schmoke, quarterback, and Curt Anderson, linebacker, established themselves in the political realm. Young was especially proud of his years as an educator, during which he taught history and political science. During that time he also earned two master's degrees from Johns Hopkins University and Loyola College. In May 1987, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in humane letters from Western Maryland College. Before being with the Giants Prior to joining the Giants, Young was on the staffs of the Baltimore Colts (1968‚Äì1974), holding positions of scout, offensive line coach, director of player personnel, and offensive coordinator, and the Miami Dolphins (1975‚Äì1978), serving as director of personnel and pro scouting. New York Giants The Giants had not made a postseason appearance in 15 years when Young was hired by the club in 1979. Wellington Mara had handled most of the franchise's football decisions since joining the organization in 1937‚Äîlong before inheriting the team from his father, team founder Tim Mara, in 1958. He'd been persuaded to give up control of some day-to-day decisions to operations director Andy Robustelli in 1974, but still had the final say in on-field matters. The fallout over the Miracle at the Meadowlands in 1978, in which a certain Giant win turned into a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on a last-second fumble, finally convinced Mara to give up his remaining authority over football matters. He asked Commissioner Pete Rozelle to recommend a new football operations chief. Rozelle recommended Young, who would only take the job if he were granted full control over the football side of the operation. Seeing the need to modernize, Mara agreed. In building the Giants he placed special emphasis on the NFL Draft. From his inaugural draft in 1979 through the 1995 selection process, he succeeded in signing every player drafted over that span, and from those drafts, a total of 119 players made the club at one time or another. Instrumental in his reversal of the Giants‚Äô fortunes was his drafting of standout players such as Phil Simms, Lawrence Taylor, Joe Morris, and Carl Banks, and selecting Bill Parcells as the club's head coach. Success During Young's tenure, the Giants earned eight playoff berths, highlighted by victories in Super Bowls XXI and XXV, and compiled an overall record of 155-139-2. He was named NFL Executive of the Year a record five times: in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1993, and 1997. Young also served as chairman of the NFL's Competition Committee. Decline Despite Young's success and Giants Head of Player Personnel Tom Boisture during the 1980s, that success would not continue into the 1990s. One of his first mistakes was his choice of a new head coach for the Giants after the May 1991 resignation of Bill Parcells. Young's selection of Ray Handley was not met with success as Handley won a total of 14 games in his two-year stint. Young‚Äîan opponent of free agency‚Äîseemed to lose his touch following the introduction of the free agency cycle following the 1992 regular season. He struggled to adapt to the system, along with the introduction of a salary cap in 1994. He as a result, signed several players to overvalued contracts while losing much of the Giants core talent to other franchises following free agency's inception. In addition, Young's draft magic seemed to disappear. From 1991-1996, The Giants drafted six consecutive first round busts, although his later round selections during that time period would consist of several prominent, elite players, such as defensive tackle Keith Hamilton, defensive end Michael Strahan, cornerback Phillippi Sparks, linebacker Jessie Armstead, cornerback Jason Sehorn, fullback Charles Way, wide receiver Amani Toomer, and running back Tiki Barber. Young retired following the 1997 season, handing his duties over to long-time assistant Ernie Accorsi.

The Court rejected a challenge by the generic drug manufacturers Novopharm and Apotex to declare Glaxo Wellcome's patent for AZT, an AIDS- fighting drug, invalid. Background Beginning in 1983, a team at Glaxo Wellcome began researching an anti-AIDS drug. The team hoped to develop a chain terminator to halt HIV in the reverse-transcription stage of its HIV life cycle. Drugs selected on the basis of their chemical structure were screened starting in 1984. One of the drugs screened at that time is what is now known as AZT. This drug was originally synthesized by cancer researchers in 1964, in a project that was eventually abandoned. Since that time, Glaxo Wellcome had been developing AZT as an anti-bacterial. In vitro testing on mouse cells revealed that AZT was potentially effective against AIDS. Glaxo Wellcome was not equipped to do testing of the drug on human cell lines, so it contracted with the National Institutes of Health for this work. In February 1985, the NIH reported the positive results of their screening to Glaxo Wellcome, and, on March 16, 1985, Glaxo Wellcome filed a patent application for a new use of AZT in the United Kingdom. The validity of this patent was brought into question by the appellant generic drug manufacturers. Reasons of the Court Utility The generic manufacturers claimed that the patent did not satisfy the utility requirement. Justice Binnie, for the Court, considered the doctrine of sound prediction to determine whether the invention was useful. There are three elements. First, there must be a factual basis for the prediction at the date that it was filed. Second, the inventor must have a sound line of reasoning from which the desired result can be inferred from the factual basis. Third, there must be proper disclosure. As Justice Binnie believed that predictability is a question of fact, he relied on the trial judge's findings and determined that all three requirements for sound prediction were satisfied. At the time the patent application was filed, Glaxo Wellcome knew that AZT was suitable for prolonged treatment of humans, that compounds of its class could act as chain terminators, and that in vitro efficacy had been shown in human cells. In applying the doctrine of sound prediction, Justice Binnie noted that the doctrine is can be applied generally but that steps should be taken to ensure that it is not abused by \\"[dilution] to include a lucky guess or mere speculation.\\" Covetous Claiming The patent claimed that AZT had both prophylactic and treatment properties. The generic manufacturers attacked the patent on the grounds that there was no sound basis to predict that the drug had any prophylactic properties. The Court did not accept this argument, instead holding that the definition of \\"prophylaxis\\" includes \\"prevention of the development of signs and symptoms of the disease [AIDS] without necessarily eradicating the causal factor [HIV]\\". Inventorship The generic drug manufacturers also sought to have the patent declared invalid on the grounds that the NIH researchers who did the human cell screening were not identified in the patent as co-inventors. Justice Binnie concluded that, to be considered a co-inventor, a person must have participated in the inventive concept and not merely its verification.

Her husband was the founding emperor Murong De (Emperor Xianwu). Her given name is lost to history, but her courtesy name Jifei was recorded and used by historians. Her father was Duan Yi (ÊÆµÂÑÄ). Duan Jifei's older sister Duan Yuanfei was the empress of Murong De's older brother, Murong Chui, the founding emperor of Later Yan. She married Murong De in or slightly before 388, when he was the Prince of Fanyang. They did not have any sons. In 398, Murong De, displeased at how Murong Chui's son and successor Murong Bao had, through incompetence, lost most of the Later Yan territory, declared himself the Prince of Yan and established the separate Southern Yan state. In 400, he declared himself emperor and created Duan Jifei empress. After Murong De died in 405 and was succeeded by his nephew Murong Chao, she became empress dowager, but in 406 became embroiled in a plot with Murong Zhong (ÊÖïÂÆπÈçæ) the Prince of Beidi and the generals Murong Fa (ÊÖïÂÆπÊ≥ï) and Duan Hong (ÊÆµÂÆè) to overthrow Murong Chao, but after one of the coconspirators, Feng Song (Â∞ÅÂµ©) was arrested, she became fearful and revealed the entire plot to Murong Chao, who then defeated the coup attempt.

The moor frog (Rana arvalis) is a slim, reddish-brown, semiaquatic amphibian native to Europe and Asia. It is a member of the family Ranidae, or true frogs. Taxonomy The family the moor frog belongs to, Ranidae, is a broad group containing 605 species. The family is like a ‚Äúcatch-all‚Äù for ranoid frogs that do not belong to any other families. Since this is the case, the characteristics that define them are more general, and the frogs are found all throughout the world, on every continent but Antarctica. The moor frog's genus, Rana, is a little more specific. Frogs of this genus are found in Europe, Asia, South America, and North America. The moor frog is not found in either of the Americas, unlike the foothill yellow-legged frog, Cascades frog, and Columbia spotted frog, which are all found in North America. The moor frog's scientific name, Rana arvalis means \\"frog of the fields\\". It is also called the Altai brown frog because frogs from the Altai Mountains in Asia have been included in the R. arvalis species. The Altai frogs have some different characteristics such as shorter shins, but currently there is no official distinction and all frogs are placed under Rana arvalis. The taxonomy may be more defined in the future. Description This is a small frog, characterized by an unspotted belly, a large, dark ear spot, and ‚Äî often, not always ‚Äî a pale stripe down the center of the back. They are generally described as a reddish-brown, but can also be yellow, gray, or light olive. Their bellies are white or yellow and they have a \\"bandit-like\\" black stripe going from their nose to their ears. They vary from 5.5 to 6.0 cm long, but can reach up to 7.0 cm in length, and their heads are more tapered than those of the Common frog (Rana temporaria). The skin on their flanks and thighs is smooth, and the posterior part of their tongues is forked and free. They have horizontal pupils, their feet are partially webbed, and their back legs are shorter than those of other species of frogs. The males are different from the females because of the nuptial pads on their first fingers and their paired guttural vocal sacs. Distribution and habitat In Belgium. The species has an extensive distribution across Europe. It can be found inhabiting an area stretching from the lowlands of Central and Southern Europe to Siberia, in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine. However, they are believed to be extirpated in Switzerland and possibly in Siberia as well; the records of frogs being in Siberia at all may have been in error. Alsace, France, constitutes the western boundary of their territory. Moor frogs were also confirmed to have been present in East Anglia in the UK, after archaeological remains were found. The types of land they can inhabit are greatly varied. They live in tundra, forest tundra, forest, forest steppe, and steppe, forest edges and glades, semideserts, swamps, meadows, fields, bush lands, and gardens. They prefer areas untouched by humans, such as damp meadows and bogs, but they still may be able to live in agricultural and urban areas. Moor frogs provide a good model for studying local adaptation as they experience a wide range of environments and are relatively limited in their movements. Their restriction in movements implies limited gene flow and facilitates evolution through adaptive genetic differentiation among populations. Ecology Hibernation A pair of moor frogs in amplexus near Hamburg, Germany. Moor frogs will hibernate sometime between September and June, depending on the latitude of the location. Frogs in southwestern, plains areas will disappear later (around November or December) and return earlier (February). Frogs in cold, polar areas, though, will disappear sooner (in September) and return later (in June). Breeding The mating season takes place between March and June right after the end of hibernation. Males form breeding choruses, and their songs sound similar to those of the agile frog, (Rana dalmatina). Their calls can \\"sound like air escaping from a submerged empty bottle: 'waug...waug...waug'. Males can also develop bright- blue coloration for a few days during the season. The spawning happens very quickly and is completed in three to 28 days. The spawn of each frog is laid in one or two clusters of 500-3000 eggs in warm, shallow waters like in ponds. Metamorphosis Metamorphosis happens between June and October. Larvae are about 45 mm long and colored dark with small metallic dots. When they become tadpoles, they eat algae and small invertebrates. The adult frogs' feeding is halted during the breeding season, but their diets consist of insects and various invertebrates. Effects of acidification on population Environmental plasticity Increased acidity levels in breeding areas may be problematic for moor frog populations, as it reduces survival and growth of the aquatic embryos and larvae. When exposed to acidity, moor frogs were however shown to be able to adapt relatively rapidly (within 16‚Äì40 generations). Local adaptation to acidity is also possible in survival during the embryonic stage, during which frogs are most sensitive to severe acidity. Moreover, compared to those from neutral sites, acid origin populations have higher embryonic and larval acid tolerance (survival and larval period were less negatively affected by low pH), higher larval growth but slower larval development rates, and larger metamorphosing size. Divergence in embryonic acid tolerance and metamorphic size correlates most strongly with breeding pond pH, whereas divergence in larval period and larval growth correlates most strongly with latitude and predator density, respectively.  Maternal effects For female moor frogs, in order to optimize their maternal investments, they need to balance between their own fitness and the fitness of their offspring.Roff, D. A. 1992. \\"The evolution of life histories. Local adaptation and genetics of acid-stress\\" Hall, New York, New York, USA. Additionally, under the great pressure exerted by acidification, female moor frogs also need to do a trade-off between quality and quantity of the offspring. Environmental stress, like acidity, may either select for or select against certain phenotypes and hence may increase variation in fitness. The adaptive optima for the population would shift greatly compared to those living in less acidic and more benign environments, thereby making the allocation of resources even more important. As a result of the increasing variation in fitness, frogs from acidic environments may also favor different reproductive strategies than those more benign environments.Kisdi, E., G. Meszna, and L. Pasztor. 19 1998. \\"Individual optimization: mechanisms shaping the optimal reaction norm\\". Evolutionary Ecology 12:211-221. Compared to neutral origin females, acid origin females tend to invest relatively more in fecundity than in egg size, invest more in their offspring than in self- maintenance, and increase their reproductive effort as their residual reproductive value decreases. Consequently, acid origin females increase the clutch size and total reproductive output with age, while neutral origin females only increase egg size but not clutch size or total reproductive output with age. In conclusion, environmental acidification lowers maternal investment, selects for investment in larger eggs at a cost to fecundity, imposes negative effects on reproductive output, and alters the relationship between female phenotype and maternal investment, as well as strengthens the egg-size-fecundity trade-off. Population threats This species is generally common and often abundant. It faces few major threats and is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The moor frog may be impacted by the destruction and pollution of breeding sites and adjacent habitats, mostly through urbanization, recreational use of waterside areas, and intensive agriculture. The species does not appear to be notably susceptible to chytridiomycosis, although the fungus has been detected in frogs in Germany.

Much of its development occurred after the Republic of China was established. Formal establishment The modern university was established in July 2005, incorporating the former Southwest China Normal University and Southwest Agricultural University, with the approval of the Chinese Ministry of Education. Campus buildings View of the SWU campus. The following buildings are on the campus: * Art Gallery * Basketball Building * Soccer Court * The Eighth Teaching Building * The Thirty-third Teaching Building * Life Science Building Southwest China Normal University Southwest China Normal University was one of the key comprehensive universities under the administration of the Chinese Ministry of Education. Originally it was created as the Southwest Teachers College. The college was the result of several mergers of the former National Women's Teachers College and the Sichuan Provincial Educational College in 1950. It was then established as Southwest China Normal University in 1985. Southwest Agricultural University Southwest Agricultural University was created in 1950, as the Southwest Agricultural College. The college was the end result of several institutions which were Sichuan Provincial Educational College, the Western China University and Xianghui College. In 1979, it was authorized by the State Council to be one of the national key universities. It was restructured as Southwest Agricultural College. In 1958, the college was upgraded as Southwest Agricultural University. In 2001, Sichuan Animal Husbandry and Veterinary College and the Citrus Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agriculture were absorbed into Southwest Agricultural University. This marked the beginning of a new Southwest Agricultural University which specializes from teaching, pedagogy, psychology, agronomy and agriculture. Prior to the merger, Southwest China Normal University and Southwest Agricultural University were neighbors with only a wall separating the two universities. Both universities had a long historical relationship, which could be located back to their common origin, West China Union University, founded in 1906.

Thornton (born 1965) is a writer, ethnographer and sociologist of culture.'Website of Sarah Thornton'. Retrieved 28 June 2009 Thornton has authored three books and many articles about artists, the art market, technology and design, the history of music technology, dance clubs, raves, cultural hierarchies, subcultures, and ethnographic research methods. Life and work Thornton was born in Canada. She lived in London, England, for 25 years. She now resides in San Francisco, CA. Her education comprises a BA in the History of Art from Concordia University, Montreal, and a PhD in the Sociology of Culture from Strathclyde University, Glasgow. Her academic posts have included a full-time lecturership at the University of Sussex, and a period as Visiting Research Fellow at Goldsmiths, University of London. She worked as a brand planner in a London advertising agency. She was the chief writer about contemporary art for The Economist. She has also written for publications including The Sunday Times Magazine, The Art Newspaper, Artforum.com, The New Yorker, The Telegraph, The Guardian, and The New Statesman.  Club Cultures: Music, Media, and Subcultural Capital  In Club Cultures: Music, Media, and Subcultural Capital (1995), Thornton examines the shift from live to recorded music for public dancing (from record shops to raves) and the resistance to recording technology's enculturation of the \\"authentic,\\" valued cultural form. The book also analyzes the dynamics of \\"hipness,\\" critiquing Pierre Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital with her own formulation of \\"subcultural capital.\\" The study responds to earlier works such as Dick Hebdige's 1979 book Subculture: The Meaning of Style. It does not see media as a reflection of social groups, but as integral to their formation. > Contrary to youth subcultural ideologies, \\"subcultures\\" do not germinate > from a seed and grow by force of their own energy into mysterious > ‚Äòmovements‚Äô only to be belatedly digested by the media. Rather, media and > other culture industries are there and effective right from the start. They > are central to the process of subcultural formation. The book is described by Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson as \\"theoretically innovative\\" and \\"conceptually adventurous\\". .  Seven Days in the Art World  The New York Times' Karen Rosenberg said that Seven Days in the Art World (2008) \\"was reported and written in a heated market, but it is poised to endure as a work of sociology...[Thornton] pushes her well-chosen subjects to explore the questions ‚ÄòWhat is an artist?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat makes a work of art great?‚Äô\\" In the UK, Ben Lewis wrote in The Sunday Times that Seven Days was \\"a Robert Altmanesque panorama of...the most important cultural phenomenon of the last ten years\\". While Peter Aspden argued in the Financial Times that \\"[Thornton] does well to resist the temptation to draw any glib, overarching conclusions. There is more than enough in her rigorous, precise reportage‚Ä¶ for the reader to make his or her own connections.\\" Andr√°s Sz√°nt√≥ reviewed Seven Days in the Art World: \\"Underneath [the book's] glossy surface lurks a sociologist's concern for institutional narratives as well as the ethnographer's conviction that entire social structures can be apprehended in seemingly frivolous patterns of speech or dress.\\"  33 Artists in 3 Acts  Thornton's book 33 Artists in 3 Acts (2014) looks at the lives and work of figures \\"from all over the art ecosystem, from the market-driven mogul (Jeff Koons) to the profoundly intellectual performance artist (UCLA professor Andrea Fraser) to the impish prankster (Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan.)\\" The central question guiding the book is: What defines an artist in the 21st century? Thornton received \\"a range of answers that will startle even art-world insiders.\\" Jackie Wullshlager of the Financial Times opined that Thornton is \\"skillfully nuanced\\" and \\"elevates gossip to sociology, writing with verve, insight and authenticity.\\" 33 Artists in 3 Acts received praise for its academic approach and \\"attention to detail and illustration of subtleties that bring her interviewees to life.... [Thornton's] flair for creating clear structures offer readers manageable points of access... without ever compromising on quality or content, or sounding pretentious.\\"  Journalism  At The Economist, Thornton penned investigative and analytical articles about the inner workings of the contemporary art market. Topics included the value of art, the role of museum validation and branding, and the impact of gender on auction prices. In 2010, she wrote an article about the Damien Hirst auction, \\"Beautiful Inside My Head Forever\\", which took place on the evening that Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 2008. The article explained how the auction was so successful. Thornton's later articles have focused on the tech world of Silicon Valley. For Cultured Magazine, she has published profiles of tech leaders including Mike Krieger (Instagram co-founder), Evan Williams (Twitter co-founder), and Ivy Ross (Head of Design for Google Hardware).  Legal action  On 26 July 2011, Thornton won a historic libel and malicious falsehood victory against Lynn Barber and The Daily Telegraph.

Career Whitney was born in Skipton, North Yorkshire. He attended Leicester Art College in 1962. His first appearance was at Fleckney Village hall Leicester, with his mates from Great Glen, Alistair Sutton, Tony Wilson and Arthur Sloper. The name of the band has escaped living memory, but may have been something to do with Jeans. Their second gig was cancelled due to snow and they never reformed. He then formed his own band known as The Farinas. They played rhythm and blues, and featured Jim King on saxophone and vocals, bassist Tim Kirchin and drummer Harry Overnall. They performed songs by Chuck Berry and The Coasters before releasing the single \\"You'd Better Stop\\" in August 1964. Later, Ric Grech replaced Tim Kirchin and Roger Chapman joined as the principal lead singer, giving a heavier blues sound before renaming the band The Roaring Sixties. During 1966, The Roaring Sixties were renamed Family and they replaced their drummer Overnall with Rob Townsend. The band issued its first single as Family entitled \\"Scene Through The Eye Of A Lens/Gypsy Woman\\" in 1967Liberty Records, released September 1967 and Family's debut album Music in a Doll's House followed in July 1968. Family's heavy, experimental rock music gained them a reputation as a progressive underground band. By 1970, with the release of their albums A Song For Me and Anyway and an appearance at the third Isle of Wight Festival on 28 August 1970, Family was creating some of the fastest and loudest rock and the most intense acoustic music in the British underground scene. Although Family proved to be popular in UK and continental Europe, success in the US eluded them and in 1973 the group broke up. Whitney's angular guitar passages on songs like \\"Drowned In Wine\\" and \\"Good News Bad News\\" were singled out by fans and critics as being essential to the Family sound. He and Chapman wrote most of Family's songs together as a team. Whitney also composed two tracks, the instrumental \\"Summer '67\\" and the childlike folk song \\"Processions\\", about a small boy enjoying a day at the seashore. Whitney formed Streetwalkers with Chapman in 1973. This new band included vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench, from The Jeff Beck Group and Hummingbird, and future Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain. They signed to the Vertigo label as Chapman Whitney Streetwalkers, recording an album entitled Streetwalkers (1974), with a line-up including other members from Family and King Crimson. Chapman and Whitney morphed their band into the Streetwalkers, which comprised five members including Bobby Tench, drummer Nicko McBrain‚Äîwho later moved on to play with Pat Travers (and eventually Iron Maiden)‚Äîand bassist Jon Plotel. The band broke up in 1977, ending eleven years of the Whitney-Chapman musical partnership. Whitney remained active in rock music. He reunited with Rob Townsend, his bandmate from Family, to form Axis Point in 1978. The line-up for this band included piano player Eddie Hardin, vocalist and guitarist Bobby Tench from Streetwalkers and former Taste bassist Richard McCracken. When Axis Point broke up in 1980, Whitney formed Los Racketeeros, a live unit which played blues and bluegrass music. Los Racketeeros recorded a debut album in 1995 with a line-up including Alan Rogers, Pete Tomlyn, and Tony Taylor. Whitney released a solo album in 1999, and played concerts with Robert A. Roberts, a singer-songwriter, vocalist, harmonica player and guitarist, who had been a founding member of the London Bluesband Roadhouse. They released a CD as The Whitney-Roberts Combo experimenting with folk music.

He was a leading specialist on the Victorian era, and the foremost historian of broadcasting in Britain. Briggs achieved international recognition during his long and prolific career for examining various aspects of modern British history. He was made a life peer in 1976. Early life Asa Briggs was born in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire in 1921 to William Briggs, an engineer, and his wife Jane. He was educated at Keighley Boys' Grammar School and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA (first class) in 1941, and a BSc in Economics (first class) from the University of London External Programme, also in 1941. Military service From 1942 to 1945 during the Second World War, Briggs served in the Intelligence Corps and worked at the British wartime codebreaking station, Bletchley Park. He was a member of \\"the Watch\\" in Hut 6, the section deciphering Enigma machine messages from the German Army and Luftwaffe.Asa Briggs, foreword to Gwen Watkins, Cracking the Luftwaffe Codes, 2006, Greenhill Books, p. 12, This posting had arisen because at college Briggs had played chess with Cambridge mathematician Howard Smith (who was to become the Director General of MI5 in 1979) and Smith had written to the head of Hut 6, Gordon Welchman, who was also a Cambridge mathematician, recommending Briggs to him. Academic career After the war, he was elected a Fellow of Worcester College, Oxford (1945‚Äì55), and was subsequently appointed University Reader in Recent Social and Economic History (1950‚Äì55). Whilst a young Fellow, Briggs proofread Winston Churchill's A History of the English-Speaking Peoples. He was later Faculty Fellow of Nuffield College (1953‚Äì55) and a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, United States (1953‚Äì54). From 1955 until 1961 he was Professor of Modern History at Leeds University and between 1961 and 1976 he was Professor of History at Sussex University, while also serving as Dean of the School of Social Studies (1961‚Äì65), Pro Vice-Chancellor (1961‚Äì67) and Vice-Chancellor (1967‚Äì76). On 4 June 2008 the University of Sussex Arts A1 and A2 lecture theatres, designed by Basil Spence, were renamed in his honour. In 1976 he returned to Oxford to become Provost of Worcester College, retiring from the post in 1991. He was Chancellor of the Open University (1978‚Äì94) and in May 1979 was awarded an honorary degree as Doctor of the University. He had been an Honorary Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, from 1968, of Worcester College, Oxford, from 1969, and of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, from 1977. He held a visiting appointment at the Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia University in the late 1980s and again at the renamed Freedom Forum Media Studies Center at Columbia in 1995‚Äì96. Announced in the 1976 Birthday Honours, he was created a life peer as Baron Briggs, of Lewes in the County of East Sussex on 19 July 1976. Between 1961 and 1995, Briggs wrote a five-volume text on the history of broadcasting in the UK from 1922 to 1974 ‚Äì essentially the history of the BBC, who commissioned the work. Briggs' other works ranged from an account of the period that Karl Marx spent in London to the corporate history of British retailer Marks and Spencer. In 1987, Lord Briggs was invited to be President of the Bront√´ Society, a literary society established in 1893 in Haworth, near Keighley, Yorkshire. He presided over the Society's centenary celebrations in 1993 and continued as President until he retired from the position in 1996. He was also President of the William Morris Society from 1978 to 1991 and President of the Victorian Society (UK) from 1986 until his death.Martin Crick, The History of the William Morris Society 1955‚Äì2005 (London, 2011); Paul Thompson, 'Asa Briggs 1921‚Äì2016', The Victorian: The Magazine of the Victorian Society, 52 (July 2016), p. 5.

Visibility in this photo is less than 500 feet. The fog season is a season of fog that occurs in some places, because of special meteorological and topographical characteristics, after a rainy period. The fog season is usually based in the cooler months (late autumn, winter and early spring). An example is found in the San Joaquin Valley and Sacramento Valley areas of California's Great Central Valley, where a thick ground fog, known as Tule fog, may form, in particular in the months from November through March. In the Tampa Bay area of Florida, the fog season is from December to February. Sydney's fog season is longer, starting from April through to October. Though it's more frequent in June due to more rain.

The 141st episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 29, 2006. In the episode, Gerald buys a hybrid car and buys into the whole progressive movement, moving his family to San Francisco and disturbing a delicate equilibrium and indirectly causing an environmental disaster along the way. The episode acts as a play on the attitude of owners of hybrid cars, as well as the similarity between the words \\"smog\\" and \\"smug\\". This is the show's last episode with the Braniff Productions logo at the end.  Plot  Kyle's father Gerald buys a new hybrid car. He soon attempts to convert the other townspeople to environmentally friendly vehicles. After alienating all of his friends with his preachy attitude, he decides he cannot live in South Park any longer and moves his family to San Francisco. After failing to convince Gerald to change his mind, Stan writes a song which convinces the entire town to purchase hybrids. Stan is later approached by Ranger McFriendly, who explains that everybody owning hybrids causes more harm than good: although emission levels are down, people who drive hybrids emit \\"smug\\", and South Park now has the second-highest levels in the country, after San Francisco. The cloud of smug forms over South Park and begins to combine with that of San Francisco. McFriendly informs the town that a cloud of smug from George Clooney's 78th Academy Awards acceptance speech will soon drift between the two potential storms, merging them together to create a system which will heavily damage South Park and completely destroy San Francisco. Meanwhile, Cartman realizes that Butters is not a satisfying target for abuse and wishes for Kyle to return. Cartman and Butters secretly travel to San Francisco, and just as the smug storm hits, Cartman finds the Broflovskis in their house. The storm destroys thousands of homes in South Park, and completely decimates San Francisco, convincing everyone that Kyle and his family have been killed. The Broflovskis reappear, however, unaware that their safety is due to the actions of Cartman. With all their cars destroyed, the townspeople vow never again to buy hybrids, but Kyle tells everyone that it isn't the hybrid cars that cause smug but rather the people who drive them. Implying that people need to drive cars and not act like they are above all other people. The town then agrees that perhaps someday they will learn to drive hybrid cars the same way they drive normal cars but for now the technology is too much. Reception TV Squads Adam Finley gave the episode a positive review, noting \\"tons of great moments, from Stan's gay little song to Cartman being forced to don a vintage diver's suit\\". IGNs Eric Goldman rated the episode an 8.0 out of 10, noting in particular the \\"very funny\\" take on San Franciscans' attitude and the \\"hysterical plot twist\\" of mocking George Clooney, who had previously provided the voice of a dog in the episode \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\", as well as a doctor in Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Home release \\"Smug Alert!\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks tenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 21, 2007. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.

Commissioned as a major, he led warriors from the Six Nations of the Grand River into battle against American invaders at Queenston Heights, Stoney Creek, and Chippawa. Likely born and educated in Scotland, he had a Scottish mother and a father who was born Cherokee in Tennessee but raised from boyhood with the English. Norton joined the British Army, serving in Ireland before being assigned to Lower Canada after the American Revolutionary War. While there he became interested in the Six Nations of Grand River, ultimately learning the Mohawk language and culture and being adopted into the tribe. In 1804 on a diplomatic trip representing the Iroquois to England, he translated the Gospel of John into Mohawk for the British and Foreign Bible Society; it was distributed in Upper Canada beginning in 1806. Early life John Norton was likely born in Scotland in the early 1760s to a Scottish mother and an English father of Cherokee birth.Taylor, pg. 359 The elder Norton had been taken as a boy by British soldiers, when they destroyed his hometown of Keowee during the French and Indian War. Norton's father was brought back to England, and raised in an English family. John Norton likely received schooling in Scotland. He served an apprenticeship as a printer, but ran away to join the army. He was assigned to Scotland, where he married. Next he was stationed in Ireland, where there were numerous Scots and border English immigrants. In 1785 he was assigned to Lower Canada (Quebec) after the end of the American Revolutionary War. While stationed with his regiment at Niagara (Upper Canada) in 1787, Norton deserted the army and was discharged. For a time, he taught at the Mohawk settlement of Tyendinaga on the Bay of Quinte, west of Kingston, Ontario. In 1791 he traveled through the Ohio Valley as a trader, establishing many contacts. During this time, he became increasingly involved with the Iroquois Six Nations of the Grand River. In 1794, he returned to Fort Niagara, where he served as an interpreter for the British Indian department. He became known to Joseph Brant, the prominent Mohawk Nation leader who became his mentor. In his early 30s, Norton was adopted into the Mohawk, with Brant as his uncle. He was given the Mohawk name of Teyoninhokarawen (roughly translated as \\"open door\\") to mark this passage. Norton moved to the Grand River reserve, where he married Catherine, a woman from one of the six Iroquois nations. Before the Canada (Constitutional) Act of 1791, on the authority of the Haldimand Proclamation, John Norton acted as interpreter in the transaction of farm land granted to 10 recipients. Mohawk chief Portrait of Major John Norton as Mohawk Chief Teyoninhokarawen by Mather Brown, ca. 1805. Yale Center for British Art Norton was strongly influenced by Joseph Brant (Thayendanega), the most prominent Mohawk chief, who had led much of the tribe through the end of the American Revolution and their resettlement in Upper Canada. Norton became a prot√©g√© of Brant, learning the Mohawk language and culture; he was adopted into the people as Thayendanega's nephew. Later he was appointed a \\"Pine Tree Chief,\\" in a public ceremony, according to Iroquois custom. This was an honorary position and was not within the hereditary line. Norton supported Brant's efforts to make the new settlements at Grand River yield more revenues for the Iroquois, especially his plan to lease land to settlers to develop it in a mutually beneficial way. The Iroquois were in transition to the kind of settled agricultural community which was a goal of the British. By 1796 Brant felt he had to compete with the reserves established at Buffalo Creek in New York for the Seneca and Tyendinaga for Mohawk at the Bay of Quinte in order to attract more Iroquois to settle at Great River. On the other side of the border in the United States, the Onondaga and Seneca were receiving annuities for the land they had ceded. Unable to develop the lands rapidly enough for agriculture, Brant proposed leasing them to settlers; he was also worried that European-Canadian settlers would otherwise squat on the Iroquois lands and gain control. The British colonial governor John Graves Simcoe wanted all sales or leases handled by the British. \\"[B]y stereotyping Indians as naive primitives, colonial officials frustrated native attempts to exploit the commercial potential of their land.\\"Taylor, The Divided Ground, p. 43 He opposed the idea of having whites lease from the Mohawk and used William Claus, deputy superintendent of the Six Nations at Grand River, to carry out his policy.Tucker (2012), Encyclopedia of War of 1812, p. 136 With the approval of the Mohawk but not the British, in 1798 Brant sold major blocks of unused land, with revenues to be invested in a British-Canadian bank to yield an annuity for the Mohawk people.Taylor, The Divided Ground, pp. 332-334 Brant died in 1807. Bible translator In the spring of 1804, Teyoninhokarawen (John Norton), went to England to negotiate treaties with the English on behalf of the Iroquois. At the request of the British and Foreign Bible Society, he translated the Gospel of John into Mohawk. His work would represent a number of firsts for the newly formed Bible Society: its first translation; first publication; and first distribution in a foreign land when it was sent to Canada. In the Mohawk Chapel at Brantford, Ontario, a memorial stained-glass window portrays the 1806 distribution of the Gospel in Mohawk. The bottom panel of the window is inscribed with Norton's preface to his translation: \\"Let us strictly adhere to what the Lord has transmitted to us in the Holy Scriptures, that thereby the unbelievers may know that love we bear the commandments of God.\\" (from bookmark produced by the Canadian Bible Society) To Cherokee country In 1809-1810 Norton had a lengthy trip to the American Southeast, where he traveled through the still extensive Cherokee territory, in part to try to find his father's people. He did meet relatives and was accepted as Cherokee. The people were under pressure from land encroachment by settlers and state governments, particularly Georgia. He kept detailed accounts of what he saw and described Cherokee towns and culture in his The Journal of Major John Norton, 1816. This journal was edited by Carl F. Klinck and James J. Talman and republished as part of the General Series of the Champlain Society in 1970. War of 1812 Norton stayed active with the Mohawk after Brant's death, although he had to deal with intervention from Claus, who had been promoted in 1800 to deputy superintendent of the Indian Department of Upper Canada. Claus courted the Mohawk and other local tribes to gain their alliance in a period of growing tensions with the United States after 1807. Norton led a handful of Six Nations warriors into battle in Tecumseh's offensive in 1811 against the Americans at Tippecanoe. When the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States began, Norton was quick to join General Isaac Brock at Detroit, despite the official neutrality of the Canadian Six Nations. Following Brock's success at Detroit, more Six Nations warriors joined the British forces as allies. Their timely arrival at Queenston Heights, under the leadership of Major Norton, John Brant (Joseph's son), and Lieutenant Kerr of the Indian Department, was crucial to British victory. William Claus also commanded a unit there. The following year (1813), Norton and his warriors covered the British retreat to Burlington Heights (present day Hamilton, ON) after the Americans took Fort George, provided scouts before a successful night attack at the Battle of Stoney Creek and contributed to the rout of the Americans at the Battle of Beaver Dams. Following Queenston Heights, Norton continued to lead larger bands of Iroquois warriors into several of the war's most significant battles. His journal, published under the title The Journal of Major John Norton, 1816, offers one of the most thorough firsthand accounts of the War of 1812. Norton included in the journal an account of his travel to the Cherokee in the American Southeast around 1809-1810. He described their settlements and culture at the start of their final golden age before the Trail of Tears and forced removal west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s. Norton always intended his journal as a document for publication. Historian Carl Benn addresses the question of \\"how Mohawk\\" Norton was and what viewpoint his journal of the War of 1812 reflects. He notes that Norton's formative years were spent in Scotland, with a Scots mother and a Cherokee father who was raised from a boy with the English. Norton was not adopted by the Mohawk until after the age of 30 but was very close to his mentor Joseph Brant. Benn concludes that, \\"by the Mohawk standards of the period, John Norton was a Mohawk;\\" the tribe had a tradition of incorporating persons of other ancestries into their culture, although such adoptions usually were of more malleable children and young women. Benn noted that some of Norton's \\"adversaries used his origins to defame him.\\". Online at Google Books Later years Norton's final years are a mystery. There were suggestions that he had left Canada and moved as far as Laredo, Mexico. His date of death is unknown but his last mention in records was in 1826. An existing manuscript of John Norton's Journal is the property of His Grace the tenth Duke of Northumberland and is contained in two large notebooks in the library of Alnwick Castle at Alnwick in Northumberland.

The plants are believed to be a mutation or sport of the white trout lily (Erythronium albidum) and evolved following the most recent ice age. The plants flower in the spring at the same time as Hepaticas, Dutchman's breeches, bloodroot, and other spring wildflowers. Nerstrand-Big Woods State Park, River Bend Nature Center, and several tracts owned by The Nature Conservancy protect portions of its habitat.  Discovery  The lily was first noted by Mary Hodges, a high school science instructor at St. Mary's School (now Shattuck-St. Mary's) in Faribault, Minnesota, and then formally listed as a new species by botanist Asa Gray in 1871.  Reproduction  Research suggests that E. propullans rarely reproduces from seed on its own, but is highly dependent on vegetative reproduction, or limited cross pollination with Erythronium albidum, thus limiting population growth and spread of the species. Erythronium propullans produces one stolon below the soil surface on the midway point of the stem on blooming plants; that stolon then produces a new bulb. On non-blooming plants, 1 to 3 stolons are produced directly from the bulbs, each ending in a new clone.  Threats  Due to the very limited historical and current distribution of E. propullans, the primary threats include development and flooding along the floodplains and ridges where it currently exists, trampling and recreational use impacts, as well as habitat changes brought on by invasive species such as common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica).

The grants were issued by the Paramara king Siyaka II. The copper plates were discovered in Harsol (or Harsola) in present-day Gujarat state. Besides the Paramara ancestors of Siyaka, the inscription mentions men with Rashtrakuta titles. Based on their identification as Rashtrakuta kings, some historians have theorized that Paramaras descended from the Rashtrakutas. However, others have argued that these men were Paramara rulers who had adopted Rashtrakuta titles to portray themselves as successors of the Rashtrakutas in Malwa.  History  In the early 20th century, the plates were in the possession of a Visnagar Brahmin named Bhatta Magan Motiram, who was a resident of Harsol. It is not known when and how the plates came to be in his possession. According to Keshavlal Dhruv, the first two plates (\\"Grant A\\") were found joined together by a ring, and the other two plates (\\"Grant B\\") were found loose. There is a Garuda symbol (the Paramara royal emblem) on only one of the plates, and the two grants were issued to a father-son duo by the same king on the same day. Therefore, it can be inferred that originally, all the plates must have been joined together. D. B. Diskalkar noticed these plates in 1922-23, and published a transcript in a Gujarati journal Puratattva. Later, he and K. N. Dikshit published a revised transcript with translation in Epigraphia Indica Volume XIX (1927).  Content  The copper plates are rectangular in shape, and are inscribed only one side. The first copper plate of Grant A is 21.5 cm x 13 cm in size, and includes 16 lines. The second plate is of 21 cm x 8.5 cm in size, and contains 11 lines. Both the Grant B copper plates measure about 20 cm x 13 cm, and contain 16 and 13 lines respectively. Both the grants are written in Sanskrit language and Nagari script. The text is a mix of prose and poetry.  Introduction  Minus the formal portion about the actual grant and the Garuda emblem, the contents of the two grants is exactly same. Both the grants open with a customary symbol, and a verse invoking blessings of the Varaha avatar of Vishnu. The first plate depicts a flying Garuda holding a snake in its right arm; the left hand is raised to strike the snake. The beautifully incised Garuda image in human form with wings on the grants, is considered to be the earlier form of drawing which came to be known as the Jain style as used in Jain manuscripts.More Documents of Jaina Paintings and Gujarati Paintings of Sixteenth and Later Centuries, Umakant Premanand Shah, L. D. Institute of Indology, 1976, p.Early Indian miniature paintings (c. 1000-1550 AD), p. 22, Rashmi Kala Agrawal, 2006  List of kings  Next, the inscriptions mention Amoghavarsha-deva, whose titles are Paramabhattakara, Maharajadhiraja and Parmaveshvara. This is followed by the name of his successor Akalavarsha-deva, whose titles are Prithvi-vallabha and Sri-vallabha. The mention of these kings is followed by the expression tasmin kule (\\"in that family\\"), although the name of the family is not mentioned. According to scholars such as K. N. Dikshit, DB Diskalkar and H V Trivedi, the name of the family appears to have been omitted because of an oversight. Next, the inscription lists three kings with conventional descriptions: * Bappairaja or Vappairaja * Vairisimha, son of Bappairaja * Siyaka, son of Vairisimha  The grants  This part of the inscription records the grants of two villages in Mohadavasaka vishaya (district) to a father-son duo. The donees were Nagar Brahmins of Anandapura, who belonged to the Gopali gotra. * Grant A: Kumbharotaka village to Lallopadhyaya, son of Govardhana * Grant B: Sihaka village to Nina Dikshita, son of Lallopadhyaya Both the grants were issued by Siyaka, who is described as Maharajadhiraja and sƒÅmanta-c≈´·∏ça-ma·πái (\\"the crest jewel among the feudatories\\"). The grants were issued on the banks of the Mahi River, on 31 January 949 CE (30 Magha 1005 VS). The inscription mentions that Siyaka assembled the residents of the Kumbharotaka, Sihaka and other neighbouring villages. In their presence, he made perpetual grants of the villages for religious merit and for his family's fame. The inscription lists the instructions for the villagers to offer the donees and their descendants the shares of the produce, royalties, taxes and gold. This is followed by imprecatory verses to curse anyone who revokes the grants. The inscription states that the grants were made at the request of the ruler of Khetaka mandala, after Siyaka's return from a successful campaign against Yogaraja. The dapaka or the officer-in-charge of registering the grants was a Thakkura named Vishnu. Both the grants were written by a Kayastha named Gunadhara. Each grant ends with a sign manual of Siyaka.  Identification of people  \\"Amoghavarsha\\" and \\"Akalavarsha\\" were titles used by the rulers of the Rashtrakuta dynasty. Therefore, some historians, such as D. C. Ganguly have identified these terms used in the inscriptions as the names of Rashtrakuta kings, most probably Amoghavarsha I (800‚Äì878 CE) and his son Krishna II (878‚Äì914 CE). Ganguly further theorizes that Siyaka's grandfather Vakpati I was a patrilinear descendant of the Rashtrakutas. However, there is a lacuna before the words tasmin kule (\\"in that family\\") in the inscription, and therefore, Ganguly's suggestion is a pure guess in absence of any concrete evidence. Critics of this theory also argue that the Rashtrakuta titles in these inscriptions refer to Paramara rulers, who had assumed these titles to portray themselves as the legitimate successors of the Rashtrakutas in the Malwa region. The Rashtrakutas had similarly adopted the titles such as Prithvi-vallabha, which had been used by the preceding Chalukya rulers. Historian Dasharatha Sharma points out that the Paramaras claimed the mythical Agnikula origin by the tenth century: had they really been descendants of the Rashtrakutas, they would not have forgotten their prestitgious royal origin within a generation. K. N. Dikshit and D. B. Diskalkar, who edited the Harsola inscription, alternatively suggested that the Paramaras may have descended from a Rashtrakuta princess. However, this cannot be said with certainty, because a portion of the original grant is missing. The next three kings mentioned in the inscription are the Paramara kings, who may have been Rashtrakuta vassals in Malwa: * Bappairaja or Vappairaja is the Prakrit form of Vakpatiraja, identified with Vakpati I * Vairisimha is Vairisimha I, the father of the issuer * Siyaka is Siyaka II, the issuer of the inscription The last names of the donees indicate that these were not hereditary surnames in the 10th century. The donees had two different last names - \\"Upadhyaya\\" and \\"Dikshita\\" - although both were Nagar Brahmins from same locality and gotra, being a father-son duo.  Identification of places  Khetaka is identified as the area around the present-day Kheda. The identity of its ruler is not certain, but he could be the successor of Prachanda of Brahmavak family. According to the 910 CE Kapadvanj grant, the Rashtrakuta king Akalavarsha made Prachanda the in-charge of the Khetaka mandala. The identity of Yogaraja is also uncertain: he may be a Chavda chief or the Chaulukya chief Avantivarman Yogaraja II. Both Chavdas and Chalukyas of Gujarat were vassals of the Pratiharas, and Siyaka may have led an expedition against either of them as a feudatory of the Rashtrakutas. Mohadavasaka (the district in which the donated villages were located) is identified with present-day Modasa. The villages - Kumbharotaka and Sihaka - are identified with the modern villages of Kamrod and Sika. Anandapura, the native place of the donees, is identified with Vadnagar. Shivanatha, the place where the king encamped, may be same as Sarnal.

A useful summary of events in 1798 may also be viewed at the Mayo Towns Website. Early life From Ashbrook, near Straide, Co. Mayo, John Moore was the son of a prosperous merchant, George Moore. He was educated at the Catholic school of Douai, and at the University of Paris under the assumed name of \\"Bellew\\". On his return to Ireland he studied for the bar but seems to have shown little interest in his studies. Appointment as President At the time of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 a force of 1,000 French soldiers under General Humbert landed at Killala. Moore joined the French as did a considerable number of his tenants. After the Battle of Castlebar which took place on 27 August 1798, General Humbert, on 31 August 1798, issued the following decree, which inter alia appointed John Moore as the President of the Government of the Province of Connacht: The above decree refers to an Irish Republic, not a Republic of Connacht. Hence, strictly speaking, it appears to be incorrect to refer to any formal establishment of a Republic of Connacht or of John Moore being appointed its President. Instead, an Irish Republic had been proclaimed and John Moore was appointed the President of one of its provinces, Connacht.Similarly, Humbert's declaration to the people upon landing in Ireland on 22 August 1798 refers only to an Irish Republic not a Republic of Connacht:- \\"LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY, UNION, After several unsuccessful attempts, behold at last Frenchmen arrived amongst you... Union, Liberty, the Irish Republic! Such is our shout. Let us march. Our hearts are devoted to you; our glory is in your happiness\\". Nevertheless, as civil or political appointments were not made for any other province of the short lived 1798 Irish Republic, the Republic of Connacht is the name that has long been commonly used for that Irish Republic. Either way, the new republic was proclaimed by the French to increase their political and logistical support in Ireland. The general tasks with which Moore was entrusted as President are apparent from the above decree. However, the rebel Republic was a puppet state and was very short-lived (discussed below). The main problem for Moore was that the Irish Roman Catholic Hierarchy was vehemently opposed to French republicanism, whether from the Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution, or the French expulsion of Pope Pius VI earlier in 1798, that resulted in a short-lived \\"Roman Republic\\". Nevertheless, among the things which President Moore did have time to do was to issue \\"paper money to a considerable extent...[i]n the name of the French Government\\".Ross, Charles (Ed), Correspondence of Charles, First Marquis Cornwalis, John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1859 Capture and trial In September 1798, just weeks after its proclamation, the Irish Royal Army mobilised westwards and the Republic was lost with defeat at the Battle of Ballinamuck. President Moore was captured in Castlebar by a Lieut.-Col. Crawford. From a letter dated 10 December 1798 from Lord Cornwallis to the Duke of Portland, it appears that President Moore was: :\\"taken a prisoner by His Majesty‚Äôs forces at Castlebar where he was found with a commission in his possession from the commander of the French invading army, under which commission he had acted and exercised authority under the enemy, being at war with our Sovereign Lord the King ...[and] he had continued to so act until he was made a prisoner.\\" Moore's trial was delayed for some time as the British authorities took the view that owing to the general strife in County Mayo and the presence of rebels, there was a significant chance Moore could be rescued by rebels if they tried to bring him to Dublin to stand trial. Owing to the delay in his trial, an attempt was made to force Moore's release under the writ of habeas corpus. However, this was unsuccessful. Moore was subsequently sentenced to transportation. According to contemporary accounts, the \\"lenity\\" of Lord Cornwallis to Moore \\"and other rebels, gave considerable offence to the violent loyalists\\".id=w_ABAAAAMAAJ&pg;=PA93&lpg;=PA93&dq;=humbert+%22for+the+province+of+connaught%22&source;=web&ots;=7R7oCCg9vB&sig;=KF6yhlI3JNbFfCvdO_7OKR8-njo#PPP7,M1 R.R. Madden, The United Irishmen, Their Lives and Times, 1846 While being taken to Duncannon Fort in Wexford, en route to New Geneva, he died in the Royal Oak Coaching Inn, Broad Street, Waterford City. State funeral After he died, Moore was buried in the cemetery of Ballygunner Temple in Waterford. The location of his grave was forgotten until it was rediscovered by chance in 1960. On 12 August 1961 his remains were exhumed and conveyed under Army Guard to Castlebar. On 13 August 1961, after funeral mass in Castlebar, Moore's remains were reinterred at The Mall in Castlebar at a state military funeral attended by President √âamon de Valera, the Taoiseach, Se√°n Lemass, several TDs, the ambassadors of Spain and France, and some of John Moore's living descendants.Connaught Telegraph, 19 August 1961; and Guy Beiner, The decline and rebirth of 'folk memory': remembering 'the year of the French' in the late twentieth century in √âire-Ireland, Journal of Irish Studies, Fall-Winter, 2003. The inscription over Moore's grave reads: :\\"Ireland's first president and a descendant of St Thomas More, who gave his life for his country in the rising of 1798 ... By the will of the people exhumed and reinterred here with all honours of church and state.\\" The claimed ancestral link between John and St Thomas More is unproven, and was presumably included for bizarre emotional and not historical reasons.Thomas More's descendants had all died out by 1807, with no link to Ireland; see http://www.thomasmorestudies.org/docs/Descendants_John.pdf In 1798 the Irish Catholic hierarchy had seen Rome occupied by Moore's allies and Pope Pius VI expelled, in a manner that St Thomas More would certainly have disapproved of. Quiet opposition by the Church resulted in the general lack of popular support for John Moore. Despite the victories at Castlebar and Collooney, the United Irish numbers in the French army had declined, resulting in the defeat at the Battle of Ballinamuck. In 1998, in connection with the bicentenary of the 1798 rebellion, at least one member of Mayo County Council proposed that Moore's remains should be exhumed once again and this time reinterred at Moore Hall, the ancestral home of the Moores. Nothing came of the proposal.See the Connaught Telegraph of 11 March 1998 Controversial plan to exhume General Moore's remains again.

He has played alongside B.B. King, Johnny Winter, and Buddy Guy. Biography Cummings started playing the five-string banjo at the age of twelve when his father's guitar was too big for his hands, and started learning basic chords and progressions, and became a fan of bluegrass music. In his late teens he encountered the early recordings of Stevie Ray Vaughan and was floored by the virtuosity. While in college in 1987 he saw Vaughan perform and he returned to the guitar with a new outlook and resolve. His first public guitar performance came in 1997, when he played at his friends wedding reception. In his late twenties he formed a band, Swamp Yankee, and in 1999 released an independently produced album, The Long Way. The trio spent two hours in a recording studio to record the nine songs for the album. Soon he was on the Northeast blues circuit with his band. In 1998 he walked into a Northeast Blues Society open jam, which led to Cummings‚Äô winning the right to compete in the Blues Foundation's 1999 International Blues Challenge, in Memphis. The following year Albert released his debut recording, The Long Way. Bluesprint magazine said it was ‚Äúa barrage of guitar pyrotechnics that calls to mind a grand mix of the styles of past masters like Albert King, Freddie King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Jimmie Hendrix.‚Äù That in turn opened up an opportunity for him to work with Double Trouble, the late Stevie Ray Vaughan's rhythm section. So taken with Cummings's fire and passion were bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Chris Layton that they volunteered to play on and produce his solo debut recording, 2003‚Äôs self-released From the Heart. Recorded in Austin, Texas, it featured Cummings fronting Double Trouble (including Reese Wynans) in their first recording project since Stevie Ray‚Äôs passing. Cummings‚Äô soulful and explosive approach to blues and rock caught the attention of Blind Pig Records, which signed him to a multi-album deal beginning in 2004. Only Shannon remained as the bassist for Cummings' next album. True To Yourself in 2004. Two years later, in 2006, Cummings recorded a fourth album Working Man, with new band members. In 2008, Cummings released a live album Feels So Good, recorded at the Colonial Theatre in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. a 95-year-old ‚Äúlittle jewel box‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs what James Taylor calls it ‚Äì that‚Äôs hosted everyone from Will Rogers to Al Jolson. The audience was so enthralled and supportive they became part of the performance in a way that‚Äôs rarely heard. As AllMusic put it, ‚ÄúIt sounds like it was one hell of a party that night.‚Äù In 2011 Albert released an instructional DVD for the Hal Leonard Corporation entitled, Working Man Blues Guitar. His 2012 album No Regrets debuted at No. 1 in the U.S., Canada and France on the iTunes Blues Charts and at No. 5 on the Billboard blues charts. In a 2012 interview, he called No Regrets his \\"best album yet\\". In July 2015, Cummings released Someone Like You, a 12-track Blind Pig album produced by David Z. In February 2020, Cummings released his 11-track Provogue Records debut titled Believe, produced by Grammy Award- winning producer Jim Gaines. Recorded at the iconic FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Cummings notes the influence the location had on the process of creating this project, ‚ÄúIf I had recorded those same songs anywhere else, then Believe would have sounded like a completely different album.‚Äù Arguably one of the most notable tracks on the album is a cover of the song Hold On by legendary soul duo Sam & Dave, illustrating Cummings' ability to fuse genres while remaining stylistically unique and fresh.

History ;Cliff dwellings The Palatki site has a set of ancient cliff dwellings in the red sandstone cliffs, built from 1100 to 1400 CE by the Sinagua people of the Ancestral Puebloans. The cliff dwellings were built under south-facing overhangs for shelter and winter sun. The Sinagua people planted crops and made pottery in the area. Palatki and Honanki, another nearby archaeological site, had the largest cliff dwellings in the Red Rock formation area from 1150 CE to 1300 CE. Palatki consists of two separate pueblos, suggesting two family or kin groups may have lived here, one in each pueblo. The circular shield-like pictographs above the eastern pueblo have been interpreted by some archaeologists as being a kin or clan symbol.Palatki and Honanki Ruins , handout by US Forest Service. This article incorporates public domain text from this and other US government documents. ;Rock art There are pictographs and petroglyphs at the Palatki site, including some that predate the cliff dwellings. Many of the pictographs on the rock walls are from the Sinagua. However, those created by peoples of the Archaic period in North America include some of the more abstract pictograph symbols and drawings that are 3,000 to 6,000 years old, and some of the petroglyphs, estimated to be 5,000 to 6,000 years old. ;Archaeology Visitation to the site for over a century has caused degradation of the archaeological elements. It was begun by 19th century Euro-American settlers, with little archaeological awareness for the area. Photographs from the early 1900s show that an estimated 70 to 90 percent of the original structures have disappeared since then. Access The Palatki Heritage Site park is open to visitors seven days a week from 9:30am to 3:00pm. There are two trails in the park, one to view the Sinagua cliff dwellings, and a second to view the pictographs and petroglyphs. The trails are not handicapped accessible.

It is named in honor of the English city of Birmingham and also for the neighborhood it connects to, which was once called Birmingham, now a part of the South Side. Many locals also may refer to it with its unofficial name, the 22nd Street bridge. History Stub of a never-built exit rampThe Birmingham Bridge was built in 1976. It replaced the South 22nd Street Bridge (aka Brady Street Bridge), which was demolished on May 29, 1978. Six days before the demolition, Pittsburgh Police, Fire, and EMS responded to a construction worker who had pinned his leg near the top of the span. After attempting unsuccessful rescues, they finally hoisted a surgeon to the site and were forced to amputate on site to save the worker's life. After the Brady Street Bridge came down, railings from its remains were rescued by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation and utilized in the construction of the Station Square station.https://newsinteractive.post- gazette.com/thedigs/2014/07/11/brady-street-bridge-blowup/ The Birmingham Bridge is notable for the dead end lanes that were originally to be part of a city belt system.

The company has produced titles that capitalize on productions by major studios, often using film titles and scripts very similar to those of current blockbusters in order to lure customers. These titles have been dubbed \\"mockbusters\\" by the press. Its titles are distributed by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, GT Media, and as of 2015, Cinedigm. The studio created the Sharknado films and the Syfy original series Z Nation. History The Asylum was founded by director David Michael Latt and former Village Roadshow executives David Rimawi and Sherri Strain in 1997. The company focused on producing straight-to-video low-budget films, usually in the horror genre, but were unable to find a market due to competition from major studios, such as Lions Gate Entertainment. In 2005, the company produced a low-budget adaptation of H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, which was released in the same year as Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the same material. Blockbuster Inc. ordered 100,000 copies of The Asylum's adaptation, a significantly larger order than any of the company's previous releases, resulting in Latt and Rimawi reconsidering their business model. In 2007, similarities between the distributor's titles and those of major studios were reported. For example, the film Transmorphers bears a number of similarities to the film Transformers, which was released theatrically two days after the release of Transmorphers. According to Latt, \\"I'm not trying to dupe anybody. I'm just trying to get my films watched. Other people do tie-ins all the time, they‚Äôre just better at being subtle about it. Another studio might make a giant robot movie that ties into the Transformers release and call it Robot Wars. We‚Äôll call ours Transmorphers.\\" In 2008, 20th Century Fox threatened legal action against The Asylum over The Day the Earth Stopped, a film capitalizing on The Day the Earth Stood Still. In 2009, Asylum producer David Rimawi stated in an interview that most Asylum films \\"break even after about three months\\". Lawsuits and legal issues Similarly in May 2012, Universal Pictures filed a lawsuit against The Asylum for their film American Battleship, claiming infringement on their film, Battleship. As a result, The Asylum changed their title to American Warships. In 2013, Warner Bros., New Line Cinema, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and The Hobbit producer Saul Zaentz commenced legal action against The Asylum for their film Age of the Hobbits (later called Lord of the Elves), claiming that they were \\"free-riding\\" on the worldwide promotional campaign for Peter Jackson's forthcoming films. The Asylum claimed its film is legally sound because its hobbits are not based on the J. R. R. Tolkien creations. The lawsuit resulted in a temporary restraining order preventing The Asylum from releasing the film on its scheduled release date. Deal with Cinedigm Corp In February 2015, The Asylum signed a multi-year deal with Cinedigm Corp; the deal provided 12 films over three years. Output Television The Asylum has been producing Z Nation for the Syfy Network since late 2014. The show is about a group that attempts to get the only known person with immunity to a zombie virus from New York to the last operating lab in California. According to show-runner Karl Shaefer, the show is intended to bring \\"a sense of hope to the horror of the apocalypse.\\" Ratings for Z Nation have been unexpectedly high, and about 1.6 million views per episode, and has been renewed for a fifth season. An eight episode spin-off of Z Nation, Black Summer has been ordered by Netflix. It focuses on a mother (Jaime King) who is searching for her daughter during the worst summer of the zombie apocalypse. The show eschews the comedy elements of the parent series and focuses instead on horror themes. The Asylum maintains a channel on streaming service Pluto TV, which showcases its movies. Films As of 2009, The Asylum's usual budget for a production was \\"well under a million dollars\\", and films would typically break even after about three months.Latt, David. 'Interview, 'Front Row', BBC Radio 4, July 16, 2010.Patterson, John. \\"Seeking Asylum: the rise of Hollywood's Z-movies\\" The Guardian, July 30, 2009. The company's productions have been called B movies and \\"mockbusters\\". Latt prefers the term \\"tie-ins\\" to \\"mockbusters\\", stating that The Asylum's productions, even those that capitalize on major releases, contain original stories. Latt states that the company plans its productions around the word of mouth of the financial prospects of upcoming films. The Asylum's films are usually released on video shortly before the theatrical release of a major studio film with similar themes or storylines. The Asylum has also produced films with strong religious themes. For example, The Apocalypse was initially developed as a straightforward disaster film in the style of Deep Impact, but Latt states that certain buyers wanted the company to develop a religious film. As a result, the company consulted priests and rabbis in order to incorporate faith-based elements. The division Faith Films was created in order to distribute titles with such themes. Sunday School Musical was produced after The Asylum staff attended a seminar for marketing to a Christian audience where the seminar's host suggested that the perfect film would be a Christian version of High School Musical. The Asylum productions sometimes feature more overt sexuality or graphic violence than their major studio counterparts, because The Asylum's releases are not in competition with films rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America. Rolf Potts of The New York Times described Transmorphers as having \\"no recognizable actors, no merchandising tie-ins and a garbled sound mix. Also unlike Transformers, it has cheap special effects and a subplot involving lesbians.\\" The 2008 release Death Racers featured the hip hop group Insane Clown Posse and wrestler Scott \\"Raven\\" Levy in major roles. In 2009, the Asylum released its first 3D picture, Sex Pot.

The complex is also accessible by the C line of the Buenos Aires Metro system and by numerous local public bus services. The stations will also be accessible by both Line E and Line H of the metro once their extensions are complete. Three stations are located opposite Plaza San Mart√≠n, a large park.  Services  Commuter rail Retiro is the largest railway complex in Buenos Aires and more commuter trains arrive and depart from here than in any other station in the city. As of 2015, the following companies operate regular services to the suburbs of Buenos Aires along three principal lines: * Mitre service calling at Jos√© Le√≥n Su√°rez (General San Mart√≠n Partido), Tigre, and Bartolom√© Mitre along its three branches. Long-distance services to Rosario and Tucum√°n cities. Both operated by Trenes Argentinos. * Belgrano Norte service to Villa Rosa (Pilar Partido). Operated by private company Ferrov√≠as. * San Mart√≠n service calling at Villa Devoto, El Palomar, Hurlingham and Pilar, amongst others. Operated by Trenes Argentinos. Long-distance In addition to its status as the hub of an extensive commuter railway network, Retiro stations are also the terminus of a few long-distance passenger services which provide access to cities in the north and west of the country. As of 2015, state-owned Trenes Argentinos manages long-distance services to the cities of C√≥rdoba, Tucum√°n and Rosario. Those services had been run by defunct company Ferrocentral.

It is used primarily by the Miao and Dong ethnic groups of the southern Chinese provinces of Guizhou and Guangxi, although it is sometimes used in contemporary Chinese compositions for the traditional instrument orchestra. The instrument consists of a bamboo-free reed pipe without finger holes, which is fitted with a metal free reed; the instrument's playing pipe is placed inside a bamboo resonator of larger diameter. The mangtong is made in several different sizes, with the largest up to two meters in length. As the mangtong produces only a single pitch, several mangtong are normally played together in hocket. Mangtong are often played together with an ensemble of free reed mouth organs called lusheng, serving as the bass instruments of that ensemble. A modernized version of the mangtong, called g«éig√© m√°ngt«íng (), was developed in the 20th century.

It is an action game which uses full motion video (FMV) to display the on-screen action. The player must correctly choose the on-screen character's actions to progress the story. The pre-recorded animation for the game was produced by Toei Animation. The game is set in a fictional future where time travel is possible. The protagonist, Reika, travels to different time periods in search of a criminal, Luda, from her time. After successfully tracking down Luda, Reika prevents his plans to alter the past. Time Gal was inspired by the success of earlier laserdisc video games, most notably the 1983 title Dragon's Lair, which also used pre-recorded animation. The game was later ported to the Sega CD for a worldwide release, and also to the LaserActive in Japan. The home console versions received a mixed reception. Gameplay Time Gal is an interactive movie game that uses pre-recorded animation rather than sprites to display the on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 3001 AD with the theft of a time travel device. The thief, Luda, steals the device to take over the world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time travel device to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario that presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period. The player uses a joystick and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues‚Äîhighlighted portions of the background or foreground‚Äîwill appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on the location of the cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.  Development  The game uses LaserDisc technology to stream pre-recorded animation, which was produced by Japanese studio Toei Animation. The game features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and amplified monaural sound. Writers Mike Toole and Jeff Kapalka separately noted similarities between Reika's visual design and Lum Invader from Urusei Yatsura as well as Yuri from Dirty Pair. They speculated that the anime characters provided inspiration for Reika. Several factors prevented an overseas release: a decline in the popularity of laserdisc arcade games in the mid-80s, the expensive price of laserdisc technology, and difficulty to translate. In the original Japanese release, Reika is voiced by Yuriko Yamamoto.  Release  Since its original release to the arcades in Japan in 1985, Time Gal has been ported to different home formats. It was first released exclusively in Japan by Nippon Victor on the Video High Density format; it could be played on Microsoft's MSX via a Sony laserdisc player. The release of Sega CD console in 1991 spawned numerous games that took advantage of the CD technology to introduce interactive FMVs. Among the new titles, Time Gal was one of several older laserdisc-based games that were ported to the system. Renovation Products acquired the rights to publish Time Gal on the Sega CD, with Wolf Team handling development. They released it, along with similar games, as part of their \\"Action-Reaction\\" series. It was first released in Japan in November 1992, and in North America and Europe the next year. A Macintosh version was also released in Japan in 1994. American press coverage of the Japanese release prompted video game enthusiasts to contact Renovations about a Western release. The number of requests persuaded Renovation's president, Hide Irie, to announce a release in the USA. In addition to being dubbed in English, a few death scenes in the US version were censored. The Sega CD version uses a smaller color palette than the original, includes a video gallery which requires passwords to view each level's animation sequences, and features a new opening and ending theme by Shinji Tamura and Motoi Sakuraba respectively. Time Gal was ported to the PlayStation in 1996 as a compilation with Ninja Hayate, another laserdisc arcade game developed by Taito. This release lacks the Sega CD version's additional content, but features a more accurate reproduction of the animation. The compilation was also released on the Sega Saturn the following year. The game can also be played on the Pioneer LaserActive via the Sega Mega-LD module. The LaserActive version is the rarest home release of Time Gal, as well as one of the most expensive on the system among collectors. On April 1, 2017, Taito Classics announced that they would release several of their older games onto mobile devices, with Time Gal being its first release. The game was later released in Japan on April 5, 2017. The ability to use the game's navigational function and the ability to see the game's original concept art can be acquired through in-app purchases.  Reception  GamePro magazine noted that \\"Japanese players ate it up\\" when it first released in Japanese arcades. However, GameSetWatch's Todd Ciolek believed it was released too late in the life of LaserDisc games, and that players \\"were getting tired\\" of the genre's gameplay. He further commented that, despite its gameplay, it was unique and charming. GamePros reviewer referred to the arcade game as a \\"lost, laserdisc treasure\\", and was enthusiastic about its Sega CD release. He called the death sequences \\"hilarious\\" and felt they reduced the tediousness of dying. MEGA magazine rated the Sega CD version the number five CD game, commenting that though it lacked difficulty, it was a good showcase of the system. Prior to its Sega CD release, Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the use of CD technology and felt it would be followed by titles with similar gameplay. Critics praised Time Gals visuals. GameFan magazine, in praising Wolfteam's port of the game, complimented the Sega CD version's graphics and short load times. GamePro said the animation is \\"great, with bright, vivid colors, and fast-paced, exciting movement\\" and praised the \\"funny gameplay\\" and \\"nonstop action\\". Chris Bieniek of VideoGames & Computer Entertainment criticized the story as \\"nonsensical\\" and said that while the unlockable video gallery is a nice feature, it effectively eliminates any replay value, which compounds the easiness of the game to give it very low longevity. He nonetheless recommended Time Gal, based chiefly on the gameplay: \\"Though you never really feel like you're in control of Time Gal's movements, the zany action has an undeniable appeal that takes up a lot of the slack.\\" Shawn Sackenheim of AllGame complimented the animation, calling it \\"high quality\\", but criticized the Sega CD graphics, calling them \\"downgraded\\". He commented that, though Time Gal offered a good thrill, it lacked replay value. Ciolek echoed similar statements, saying it is more enjoyable to watch than to play. He further commented that the game is frustrating and rigid when compared to more contemporary standards. Electronic Gaming Monthlys group of reviewers praised the Sega CD version's graphics quality. Three of the four reviewers lauded the gameplay, specifically the challenge and format. The other reviewer stated he didn't care for this type of game, referring to the gameplay as \\"nothing more than memorizing\\". Legacy IGN's Levi Buchanan listed interactive games like Time Gal as one of the reasons behind the Sega CD's commercial failure, citing them as a waste of the system's capabilities. In describing the cinematic gameplay in the 2009 action game Ninja Blade, producer Masanori Takeuchi attributed the quick time event game mechanic featured in his title to laserdisc games like Dragon's Lair and Time Gal. Todd Ciolek referred to the protagonist as one of the first human heroines in the industry. He further added that Reika was an appealing lead character that Taito could have easily turned into a mascot and featured in other games and media. The character was later included in Alfa System's shooting game Castle of Shikigami III‚ÄîTaito published the arcade version in Japan. In the game, Reika features attacks and personality similar to her original debut as well as an updated visual design. Reika's also appeared in the 2011 Elevator Action remake Elevator Action Deluxe as one part of downloadable content.

It is a Welcoming Congregation and a member of the Unitarian Universalist Association. The church is notable for its almost 400-year history, which includes pivotal roles in the development of the early Massachusetts government, the creation of Harvard College, and the refinement of current liberal religious thought. Site history Harvard President Josiah Quincy III of the September 1836 procession of Harvard alumni leaving the First Parish Meeting House and walking to the Pavilion The original First Parish, called at the time the first Meeting House, was built near the corner of Dunster and Mount Auburn streets in 1632. The Meeting House's first minister, Thomas Hooker, stayed only a handful of years; he and most of his flock moved to Connecticut to escape religious persecution in 1636. Reverend Thomas Shepard, a significant leader of the great Puritan migration to New England at the time, gathered a new church, the First Church in Cambridge, on February 1, 1636. One year later, Reverend Shepard used his influence with the General Court of Massachusetts to move Harvard College to Newtowne (later called Cambridge), a short distance away from his newly established church, so that the Harvard college students might \\"benefit from proximity\\" to his evangelical preaching. The Harvard College Yard became the site for the second Meeting House, built in 1652, and the third, in 1706, and the fourth, 1756, all located in the corner now occupied by the college's Lehman Hall. In 1833, the congregation built the fifth and final Meeting House, which stands adjacent to present-day Harvard Yard. Harvard College held its annual commencement ceremonies therein for the next forty years. Five Harvard College presidents‚ÄîEverett, Sparks, Walker, Felton, Hill, and Eliot‚Äîbegan their inaugural terms there as well. The Parish House was built in 1902, and the interior of the Meeting House remodeled in 1914. The Crothers chapel was dedicated in 1941. Governmental role In the century following the founding of the Town of Cambridge in 1630, the whole community transacted the parish affairs through town meetings. Said another way, the townspeople were responsible for governing the area and for providing financial support for the Meeting House and the ministry. In 1733, the First Parish in Cambridge moved away from its close governmental role and separately organized itself as a territorial parish. Within the town (which was considered a \\"parish\\" after 1733), the church was a relatively small, covenanted body of those admitted to full communion. Such costs as the maintenance of the meeting house and the salary of the town's \\"public teacher of piety, religion, and morality\\" (who was also the minister of the church) were met by regular assessments on all persons domiciled within the territorial limits of the parish (unless exempted because they were supporting either Baptist or Episcopal worship). The power of the parish to assess the inhabitants for ecclesiastical purposes was abolished in Massachusetts in 1833. Since then, the parish has been a poll parish, rather than a territorial parish. Evolution of church doctrine Throughout the 17th century, Reverend Shepard and his successors preached a Calvinistic doctrine. In the 18th century, the ministers moved the theology in a more liberal direction. Specifically, Reverend William Brattle and Reverend Nathaniel Appleton amended their Calvinist preaching to encourage \\"free inquiry\\", and they held a tolerant and catholic spirit towards those who differed on doctrinal matters. Appleton's successor, Timothy Hilliard, was Arminian rather than Calvinistic in theology. The division between Calvinists and Arminians, which appeared in many churches of the Standing Order in the 18th century, reached a time of crisis in the period from 1805 to 1830. The minister of the Cambridge church at that time was the Reverend Abiel Holmes, the father of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Reverend Holmes held to orthodox doctrinal views, but he remained on friendly terms with the liberal or Arminian party for three decades after his installation in 1792. In 1826, however, he decided to break off relations with the liberals, specifically abolishing pulpit exchanges with the liberal or Unitarian ministers. After vainly attempting to persuade Reverend Holmes to return to his earlier, more inclusive practices, the Parish voted to dismiss him as its public teacher of religion and morality. By 1829, most of the Parish became Unitarian. Dr. Holmes and the more conservative members of his flock departed and founded the Shepard Congregational Society. In 1899, it was agreed that the church associated with that society should be called the First Church in Cambridge (Congregational), now part of the United Church of Christ, and this church, the First Parish in Cambridge (Unitarian) [now Unitarian Universalist]. The Reverend William Newell, the church's first avowedly Unitarian minister, led the congregation from 1830 to 1868. His immediate successor, Francis Greenwood Peabody, would become a leader of the Social Gospel movement. The fourteenth minister, Reverend Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers, an eloquent preacher and widely read essayist, managed to attract a following from both the University and the Old Cambridge communities. In 1837, Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered his now famous \\"American Scholar\\" address‚Äîreferred to by Oliver Wendell Holmes as America's \\"Intellectual Declaration of Independence\\"‚Äîat the First Parish Church. Present membership Since its founding, the town of Cambridge has changed greatly. Instead of being a rural community, separated from Boston by an hour's travel time, the town has become an urban center in its own right. The Cambridge church is to all intents and purposes a downtown church. Its membership fluctuates, as urban communities do, and its composition varies. The current church leadership, however, is committed to maintaining the witness of liberal religion, in keeping with the struggles of earlier generations.

He built a number of buildings in and around Madrid, including many schools. Background The son of Hermenegildo Giner de los R√≠os and Laura Garc√≠a Hoppe, Bernardo Giner de los R√≠os was born into a family of intellectuals and progressive politicians. His uncle, Francisco Giner de los R√≠os, was a philosopher and proponent of the ideas of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause. Francisco Giner de los R√≠os translated selections from Krause's aesthetic writings in 1874 as Compendio de Est√©tica. Francisco and Hermenegildo Giner de los R√≠os also founded the freethinking Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza in 1876. Career Architecture Beginning his career in the 1920s, Bernardo Giner de los R√≠os specialised in the construction of schools, serving as a school inspector for the Spanish province of Levante, around Alicante, and built many schools in Madrid. During the Spanish Civil War, from 1936 to 1939, he served as the Minister of Communications, Transport and Public Works for the Republican government. After the war, he spent a year in Santo Domingo before moving to Mexico in 1940, where he developed an active career. From 1945 to 1960 he served as General Secretary of the Presidency of the Republic in exile. He spent the years 1946-1949 in Paris in this role before returning to Mexico, where he died in 1970. Writings In Mexico City in 1952, Giner de los R√≠os published 50 A√±os de Arquitectura Espa√±ola (1900-1950) (\\"50 Years of Spanish Architecture\\"), a history of Spanish architecture in the 20th century that had grown out of a talk that he gave at the Ateneo Espa√±ol de M√©xico in August 1951. Although he assumed an objective voice and omitted a political discussion of architecture from this book, Giner de los R√≠os' point of view is important given his political activity and his family's history with the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza. The book adopted a progressive, but technocratic view of modernization and focused on the role of school construction and municipal urban design achievements in Spanish architecture. Open minded about aesthetics, Giner de los R√≠os himself built schools in the modern Madrile√±o compromise style typical of the younger generation of architects, red-brick with strip windows and moldings of simplified section, like many 1930s buildings at the new University City of Madrid (Ciudad Universitaria). However, Giner's book for the most part set aside politics and matters of architectural style to focus on technical advances and planning successes. This approach emphasize the continuity of architectural thinking through a period of rapidly changing political regimes and projects. From 1961 to 1970, the Bolet√≠n de la Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza resumed publication (it had stopped in 1936) in Mexico under his direction.

Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court that upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (Enrolled as Agreed to or Passed by Both House and Senate) The case reached the high court after U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales appealed a ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in favor of LeRoy Carhart that struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Also before the Supreme Court was the consolidated appeal of Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. The Supreme Court's decision upheld Congress's ban and held that it did not impose an undue burden on the due process right of women to obtain an abortion, \\"under precedents we here assume to be controlling,\\". such as the Court's prior decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In a legal sense, the case distinguished but did not overrule Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), in which the Court dealt with related issues. However, Gonzales was widely interpreted as signaling a shift in Supreme Court jurisprudence toward a restriction of abortion rights, occasioned in part by the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor and her replacement by Samuel Alito. The Court found that there is \\"uncertainty [in the medical community] over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a woman's health\\"; and in the past the Court \\"has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.\\" History of case The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was signed into law by President Bush on November 5, 2003. It was found unconstitutional in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of California, the Southern District of New York, and the District of Nebraska.Planned Parenthood v.

Ashcroft, Opinion and Order, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (August 26, 2004)Carhart v. Ashcroft, Memorandum and Order , United States District Court for the District of Nebraska (September 8, 2004) The federal government appealed the district court rulings, first bringing Carhart v. Gonzales before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The panel unanimously affirmed the ruling of the Nebraska court on July 8, 2005. Finding that the government offered no \\"new evidence which would serve to distinguish this record from the record reviewed by the Supreme Court in Stenberg,\\" they held that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the woman.Gonzales v. Carhart, United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (July 8, 2005) Attorney General Gonzales petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Eighth Circuit decision on September 25, 2005.

Planned Parenthood (November 8, 2006) via Oyez web site Decision Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the Court that the respondents had failed to prove that Congress lacked authority to ban this abortion procedure. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Antonin Scalia agreed with the Court's judgment, joining Kennedy's opinion. The Court left the door open for as-applied challenges, citing its recent precedent in Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of New England. According to Washington Post reporter Benjamin Wittes, \\"The Court majority, following the path it sketched out last year in the New Hampshire case, decided to let the law stand as a facial matter and let the parties fight later about what, if any, applications need to be blocked.\\" The Court decided to \\"assume ... for the purposes of this opinion\\" the principles of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court said that the lower courts had repudiated a central premise of Casey ‚Äî that the state has an interest in preserving fetal life ‚Äî and the Court held that the ban fit that interest so as not to create an undue burden. The opinion did not rely deferentially on Congress's findings that this intact dilation and extraction procedure is never needed to protect the health of a pregnant woman; in fact the Court found that \\"evidence presented in the District Courts contradicts that conclusion.\\" However, Kennedy wrote that a health exception was unnecessary where medical testimony disputes Congress's findings, that Congress is still entitled to regulate in an area where the medical community has not reached a consensus. In addition, the Court distinguished this case from the Stenberg case (in which the Court struck down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law) by holding that the state statute at issue in Stenberg was more ambiguous than the later federal statute at issue in Carhart. Without discussing the constitutional rationale of the Court's prior abortion cases (i.e. \\"due process\\"), the majority opinion stated it disagreed with the Eighth Circuit's determination that the federal statute conflicted with \\"the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, [which] is textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" Concurrence Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Scalia, which mentions saving for another day the issue of whether Congress had sufficient power under the Commerce Clause to enact this ban. The Commerce Clause (the only Constitutional clause mentioned explicitly in any of the decision's three opinions) was also mentioned in the majority opinion. The concurrence also stated that Justices Thomas and Scalia joined the Court's opinion \\"because it accurately applies current jurisprudence.\\" In addition, the concurrence reiterated the justices' view that current abortion jurisprudence \\"has no basis in the Constitution.\\" Nadine Strossen, president of the ACLU at the time, pointed out that \\"no less an anti-abortion proponent than Justice Scalia joined by Justice Thomas, in his separate opinion, chided the majority for not coming out and explicitly saying that they had overturned not Roe v. Wade, but the prior partial-birth abortion ban case.\\"Interview with Nadine Strossen, David Shankbone, Wikinews, October 30, 2007. Dissent Joined by justices David Souter, John Paul Stevens, and Stephen Breyer, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented,Gonzales v. Carhart, Ginsburg, J., dissenting, U.S. Supreme Court (April 18, 2007) contending that the ruling was an \\"alarming\\" one that ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent and \\"refuse[d] to take Casey and Stenberg seriously.\\" Referring in particular to Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Ginsburg sought to ground the Court's abortion jurisprudence based on concepts of personal autonomy and equal citizenship rather than the Court's previous privacy approach: \\"Thus, legal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature.\\" Ginsburg also took issue with the lack of a health exception, writing that \\"the absence of a health exception burdens all women for whom it is relevant‚Äîwomen who, in the judgment of their doctors, require an intact D&E; because other procedures would place their health at risk.\\" In general, the dissent criticized the usurpation of medical decision-making by legislators and the minimization of \\"the reasoned medical judgments of highly trained doctors ... as 'preferences' motivated by 'mere convenience'.\\" Observing that the majority opinion in Carhart did not touch upon the question of whether the Court's prior decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey were valid, Justice Ginsburg wrote, \\"Casey's principles, confirming the continuing vitality of 'the essential holding of Roe,' are merely 'assume[d]' for the moment ... rather than 'retained' or 'reaffirmed.'\\" She concluded by criticizing the majority for abandoning the principle of stare decisis, writing that \\"a decision so at odds with our jurisprudence should not have staying power.\\" Reactions According to an ABC News poll, the majority of Americans (69%) oppose the legality of D&X; or what opponents call \\"partial- birth\\" abortion. Some medical groups expressed concern that the Court, in supporting the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, endorsed the substitution of congressional legislation for medical judgment. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which had submitted an amicus brief opposing the Act, described the Court's decision as \\"shameful and incomprehensible\\", ignorant of medical consensus, and chilling for the medical profession. The New England Journal of Medicine criticized the intrusion of politicians into medical decision-making, writing: > Until this opinion, the Court recognized the importance of not interfering > with medical judgments made by physicians to protect a patient's interest. > For the first time, the Court permits congressional judgment to replace > medical judgment. Professor and academic Geoffrey R. Stone has argued that the religion of Supreme Court judges played an important role in the decision, given that the five judges in the majority were Catholic.

It runs parallel to the south shore of Lake Ontario for most of its length between Niagara County and Monroe County. NY 18, which also passes through Orleans County, acts as a northerly alternate to NY 104, another east‚Äìwest route that parallels NY 18 to the south on Ridge Road. The western terminus of NY 18 is at a complex grade-separated interchange with NY 104 outside the village of Lewiston. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 104 in an area of Rochester known as Kodak Park. NY 18 was assigned in 1924 and originally extended from the Pennsylvania state line near Salamanca to downtown Buffalo via Dayton and Hamburg. It was extended northeast to Rochester via Niagara Falls as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and east to NY 250 in the town of Webster by the following year. NY 18 was truncated on its west end to the town of Lewiston in the early 1960s and on its east end to Rochester in the early 1970s. Although NY 18 is signed as east‚Äìwest, it runs primarily north‚Äìsouth through the western portion of Niagara County. After leaving Niagara County, NY 18 shifts farther south, gradually moving away from the shore of Lake Ontario. In central Orleans County, NY 18 meets the Lake Ontario State Parkway at the Lakeside Beach State Park. The parkway then becomes the lakeside road, and NY 18 veers south to follow a more inland routing. Route description Niagara County NY 18 northwest of Model City NY 18 begins at a junction with NY 104 south of a complex grade-separated interchange that includes NY 18F, NY 104, and the Niagara Scenic Parkway on the eastern edge of the village of Lewiston. From NY 104 east, a right-turn ramp allows access to Creek Road Extension, the first street that modern-day NY 18 occupies. NY 104 continues north from the ramp, passing over NY 18 westbound (which terminates at the merge ramp with NY 104 west) on its way to the village while NY 18 proceeds to the northeast on Creek Road Extension, bypassing Lewiston to the southeast. After , the highway curves to the north and meets NY 104 at an unconventional grade-separated interchange that has a pair of two-way ramps connecting the two state routes. NY 18 continues on, passing under NY 104 and paralleling the Robert Moses State Parkway as it proceeds north. At a wye in the Porter hamlet of Blairville, NY 18 breaks from its north-south alignment and turns to the northeast before curving northward once more, returning to a perfect north- south alignment at an intersection with NY 93 in the hamlet of Towers Corners. Southwest of the Four Mile Creek State Park, NY 18 turns a full 90 degrees to the east and begins to parallel the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Here, NY 18 meets the northern terminus of NY 18F, changes names from Creek Road to Lake Road, and becomes part of the Seaway Trail, a National Scenic Byway. The route proceeds northeast to Four Mile Creek State Park, where it intersects the northern end of the Robert Moses State Parkway. East of the park, NY 18 gradually moves to the north, decreasing the area between the route and the lakeshore as it proceeds east. Now in Wilson and less than from the lakeshore, NY 18 meets the northern terminus of NY 425\\\\. Farther east, in Olcott, NY 18 intersects the northern extent of NY 78\\\\. On the eastern edge of town, the route intersects Transit Road, which runs along the transit line first surveyed by the Holland Land Company. This portion of Transit Road does not meet the NY 78-occupied portion in Lockport, however. After meeting the northern end of NY 148 in Somerset, NY 18 intersects the northern terminus of NY 269 at the Niagara‚ÄìOrleans County line. Orleans County Northbound on NY 18 (west) and NY 272 along the Orleans‚ÄìMonroe County line Across the county line, NY 18 becomes the Roosevelt Highway. It continues across the northern edge of the county and the southern fringe of Lake Ontario, meeting the northern terminus of NY 63 in Yates Center, north of Lyndonville. While NY 63 ends here, Lyndonville Road continues north to the lake as County Route 63-1 (CR 63-1). This portion of Lyndonville Road was once part of NY 63. In Carlton, NY 18 intersects the northern terminus of NY 279, the last in a series of north-south routes that terminate at NY 18\\\\. Not far to the east, the route serves Lakeside Beach State Park and indirectly connects to the western terminus of the Lake Ontario State Parkway. At this point, the Seaway Trail leaves NY 18 to follow the parkway along the lakeshore. East of the park, NY 18 breaks from the Lake Ontario shore and begins to make its way southward, curving to the southeast as it meets NY 98 north of the hamlet of Baldwin Corner. The routes converge to form a concurrency south to the hamlet, where NY 18 continues east. At the Carlton‚ÄìKendall town line, NY 18 curves southeastward once again before reverting to an easterly alignment in Kendall. After passing NY 237 south of the hamlet of Kendall, NY 18 intersects NY 272 at the Orleans‚ÄìMonroe County line. NY 18 merges onto the county line road, overlapping NY 272 along the county line for just under to the continuation of Roosevelt Highway, where NY 18 continues east into Monroe County. Monroe County NY 18 remains Roosevelt Highway until Hamlin-Parma Town Line Road, where is becomes West Avenue. In the hamlet of Hamlin, it meets NY 19\\\\. NY 18 passes NY 260 before swerving northward onto West Avenue at the Hamlin‚ÄìParma town line and proceeding eastward toward the village of Hilton. In Hilton, NY 18 meets NY 259 (Lake Avenue) in the center of the village. The two routes overlap for a short distance east along Main Street before turning south to exit the village on South Avenue. NY 18 eastbound in Rochester about a half- mile north of NY 104 NY 18 and NY 259, now named Hilton‚ÄìParma Corners Road, remain concurrent until Parma Center, where NY 18 turns east to follow Parma Center Road for roughly through a rural portion of Parma. Parma Center Road ends upon intersecting NY 261 (Manitou Road) at the Parma‚ÄìGreece town line; as a result, NY 18 joins NY 261 for one block southward before returning east on Latta Road and entering the Rochester suburb of Greece. NY 18 passes through the rural northwestern part of the town and the more developed, densely populated northeastern section, meeting NY 390 at exit 26 in the latter. The junction is the northernmost exit on NY 390 prior to its merging with the Lake Ontario State Parkway to the north. A small distance east of NY 390, NY 18 passes Greece Arcadia High School and intersects Mount Read Boulevard in the hamlet of Mount Read before intersecting Dewey Avenue a half-mile to the east. NY 18 turns south onto Dewey Avenue; however, state maintenance continues to follow Latta Road east to where it crosses into the Rochester city limits at Charlotte. This section of Latta Road is designated as NY 941A, an unsigned reference route. NY 18, meanwhile, becomes maintained by Monroe County as part of CR 132, an unsigned designation that follows Dewey Avenue north to its end at the Lake Ontario shoreline. The route continues south on Dewey Avenue to the Rochester city line, where CR 132 ends and maintenance of the route shifts to the city of Rochester. NY 18 ends about later at a junction with NY 104 in an industrialized area known as Kodak Park. History Origins and early changes Looking west at the junction of NY 18 and NY 19 in Hamlin. NY 18 initially turned right here and followed modern NY 19 and the now- decommissioned NY 360 into Orleans County. In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 18, an unsigned legislative route that ran from the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley to the mouth of the Niagara River north of Youngstown with a gap through the city of Buffalo. North of Buffalo, Route 18 followed Niagara Falls Boulevard (modern NY 950K and U.S. Route 62 or US 62) to Niagara Falls and current NY 104 and NY 18F between Niagara Falls and Lake Ontario. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of legislative Route 18 north of Buffalo became the basis for NY 34, which began at Main Street (NY 5) in Buffalo and followed the path of legislative Route 18 through Niagara Falls and along the Niagara River to Lake Ontario. NY 18 was assigned at the same time; however, it initially went from the Pennsylvania state line at Limestone north to Buffalo along what is now US 219, NY 417, NY 353 and US 62\\\\. In Cattaraugus County, NY 18 initially followed Leon and New Albion Roads between Cattaraugus and Little Valley. NY 18 was extended northeastward to Rochester as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, effectively doubling the route's length. Instead of ending at the junction of Ohio and Main Streets (the latter then part of NY 5) in downtown Buffalo, NY 18 now overlapped with NY 5 along Main Street north to Niagara Falls Boulevard, where it turned north and proceeded to Lake Ontario over NY 34\\\\. At Youngstown, the route turned east, following a previously unnumbered alignment along the lakeshore to Rochester, where it ended at NY 31 (now NY 104) in Kodak Park. The route was extended further eastward to NY 250 in Webster by the following year by way of East Ridge Road, Culver Road, and Lake Road. NY 18 was never extended eastward past its junction with NY 250. While the general routing of NY 18 between Youngstown and Rochester was the same in 1930 as it is now, it initially followed a slightly different alignment through eastern Orleans County and western Monroe County. NY 18 broke from its current alignment at Carr Road and followed Carr, Kenmore and Kendall Roads through the town of Kendall to the hamlet of Morton, from where it continued to Hamlin via the now-decommissioned NY 360 and NY 19\\\\. Additionally, NY 18 utilized Hamlin Center Road and what is now NY 260 between Hamlin and Roosevelt Highway. reference marker for NY 18 on Lake Road in Webster The majority of NY 18's routing south of the village of Lewiston was incorporated into the U.S. Highway System in the early 1930s after US 62 and US 219 were extended into New York and US 104 was assigned. NY 18 now began concurrent to US 219 at the state line and overlapped the route northward to the city of Salamanca. US 219 left NY 18 here, and the latter continued independently to the town of Dayton, where it intersected US 62\\\\. From there, US 62 followed NY 18 north to a junction with US 104 (Main Street) in Niagara Falls. US 62 ended here, and NY 18 became concurrent to US 104 upon turning onto Main Street. The overlap ended in the village of Lewiston, where US 104 turned east to follow Ridge Road instead. Realignments and truncation By 1931, NY 18 was realigned to follow its current alignment between Hamlin and the Parma town line while the modern routing of NY 18 between the Orleans County line and Hamlin was designated as NY 360. The alignments of NY 360 and NY 18 between NY 272 and Hamlin were flipped , placing both routes on their modern routings through Hamlin. NY 18 was moved onto its present routing through Kendall , bypassing the hamlets of Kendall and Morton to the south. In the Buffalo area, NY 18 was realigned twice in the 1930s: first by 1935 to bypass downtown to the east on Bailey Avenue between Abbott Road and Main Street and again in the late 1930s to use Bailey Avenue and Eggert Road between Main Street and Niagara Falls Boulevard. The Cattaraugus‚ÄìLittle Valley segment of the route was realigned to travel directly between the two locations. Its former routing via New Albion became NY 18F; however, that designation was eliminated , and ownership of the New Albion route was transferred to Cattaraugus County, which has maintained it as portions of County Routes 5 and 6 ever since. NY 590 in Irondequoit NY 18 was rerouted between Lewiston and Youngstown on January 1, 1949, to follow a more inland highway through western Niagara County. The former routing of NY 18 alongside the Niagara River was redesignated as NY 18F. To the east in Rochester, NY 18 was realigned in the early 1950s to follow East Ridge Road east to the then-southern terminus of the Sea Breeze Expressway. The route turned north, following the highway to its end at Culver Road, where it rejoined its pre-expressway alignment. The western terminus of NY 18 was moved north to its present location in Lewiston on January 1, 1962, eliminating the three lengthy overlaps that existed between Pennsylvania and Lewiston. The lone independent portion of NY 18 south of Lewiston was renumbered NY 353. On January 1, 1970, NY 47 was extended northward to encompass the entirety of the now-complete Sea Breeze Expressway, creating an overlap with NY 18 between Ridge and Culver Roads. Prior to the extension, NY 47 had ended at Empire Boulevard (US 104, now NY 404). The overlap proved to be temporary as NY 18 was truncated westward to its current eastern terminus in Kodak Park. The former routing of NY 18 between NY 590 and NY 250 was redesignated as NY 941L, an unsigned reference route. East Ridge Road, meanwhile, was now devoid of any designations as US 104 had been shifted onto the Keeler Street Expressway several years before. As a result, ownership and maintenance of the Irondequoit section of East Ridge Road was transferred to Monroe County, which designated it as the unsigned CR 241\\\\. Culver Road, meanwhile, is now CR 120.  Olcott realignment  The alignment of NY 18 through Olcott Beach dated back to the early 1800s, starting with a foot bridge over Eighteen Mile Creek in 1811, built out of wood. This was replaced by a white oak frame bridge built in 1825 for $500 (1825 USD) for the use of transporting wagons across the creek. General James Weisner contracted to build the bridge, which was wide, along with 20 long spans. That bridge was replaced in 1878 by an iron structure with dimensions of . This new span was a swing bridge, compared to the prior fixed structures. The New York State Department of Public Works replaced that structure with another fixed span in 1935. This span was too low to the water line, causing a bottleneck of boats and ships entering Eighteen Mile Creek. This two-lane structure was a long structure, that also caused a bottleneck for drivers because there became no parking in Olcott. Former NY 18 alignment in Olcott approaching the old bridge built in 1935 Frustration grew in the 1960s to this low-level bridge. This involved a community movement to get a new bridge built through Olcott in 1966. This would involve razing the former span from 1935 and opening Eighteen Mile Creek back to the boaters who could not fit under the span. The creek, navigable from nearby Burt, would get more use without the bridge blocking the boats from entering. A new bridge would need to be a high, compared to , which the older structure was. Residents felt that if they got a new bridge built, they could make at least $60,00 for attracting schooners to Olcott. They felt that with boat owners, Olcott's average income would skyrocket to $500,000 a year. The construction of a new bridge would expand the harbor in Olcott overall. The petition for a new bridge attracted almost 400 signatures from local residents, boaters and landowners. This petition reached State Senator Earl W. Brydges, a resident of Wilson. He drafted legislation to fund $500,000 to the Department of Public Works to construct a new bridge in Olcott. Assemblyman V. Sumner Carroll of Niagara Falls followed with the Assembly. Initial estimates for a new bridge, located south of the current structure, would be $370,000. This would keep traffic flow from being interrupted for construction, building an improved alignment of NY 18\\\\. The right-of-way costs would be cheaper and the harbor would have a new structure to appease the design of the area. By February 1967 the support for a new bridge grew locally. The bridge, which now cost over $1.75 million to build, would be high. Engineers suggested that would be the highest rebuilding the current structure could go. Engineers also considered alternate concepts, but the design of the area prohibited any options besides a new bridge. This new bridge would involve building an approach at West Creek Road near the local water tower. This would bypass downtown Olcott to the south, crossing Eighteen Mile Creek before reaching a junction with NY 78 south of the current intersection between NY 18 and NY 78\\\\. The alignment would then cross Franklin Street and through nearby Krull Park where it would meet then-current NY 18\\\\. This new alignment would be long, coming at the cost of 16 structures. This would include farm buildings, barber shop, gas station and a few homes. Some locals asked if the construction would be superfluous with the construction of the nearby Lake Ontario State Parkway, which they stated would be several miles south of Olcott. The new bridge over Eighteen Mile Creek built in Olcott from 1968-1970, seen from the old structure's location upstream By January 1968, the number of properties affected rose to 67, with 20 homes affected in various fashions. The new bridge would cost $1.1 million, would be long, with four lanes wide. The new approaches to the bridge would cost $1.4 million to build. At that point, the Department of Public Works speculated construction would begin in 1968. Meanwhile, money was granted for the study of widening the Olcott harbor channel for boaters. On June 21, 1968, it was announced that the Tuscarora Construction Company of Amherst made a winning $2,578,783 bid for construction of the bridge and its approaches. Construction began in August 1968, with land clearing and construction of the physical bridge in October 1968\\\\. The New York State Department of Transportation said the project would be complete by December 1, 1970. Construction rapidly advanced through 1968 into and into 1969, with the new piers being built by April 1969\\\\. Concrete was being poured in the piers, while power, gas and electric lines were being realigned for construction. With the construction running ahead of schedule, there was a belief that the project could be finished ahead of schedule. Construction of abutments was to start soon in May 1969. The process was so rapidly advancing that despite the late delivery of steel in October 1969 for the new structure, it failed to stop the construction. The rapid pace continued into 1970, with the construction ahead of the new November 15, 1970 deadline. However, construction continued until the bridge opened on November 9, 1970 to traffic at 11 am. The Army Corps of Engineers expanded navigation of Eighteen Mile Creek to Burt in February 1972 thanks to bridge construction. However, despite the new bridge, the history of bridges at Olcott caused problems for boaters. Despite the old bridge being torn out, the pilings of the 1878 structure were still present underwater. Suffixed routes NY 18 has had seven suffixed routes using six designations; only one, NY 18F, still exists. Most of the routes were renumbered when NY 18 was truncated to Lewiston . *NY 18A was an alternate route of NY 18 between Collins and Hamburg. It was assigned in 1930 and mostly replaced with an extended NY 75 . *NY 18B was an alternate route of NY 18 through the eastern suburbs of Buffalo. It was assigned and mostly replaced with an extended NY 277 . NY 18E's former alignment in the Earl W. Brydges Artpark State Park *NY 18C was a short-lived alternate route of NY 18 through the eastern Buffalo suburbs.

The term dates from the first three decades of radio (1888-1918). Unlike modern radio stations which transmit sound (an audio signal) on an uninterrupted carrier wave, early radio stations transmitted information by radiotelegraphy. The transmitter was switched on and off to produce long or short periods of radio waves, spelling out text messages in Morse code. Therefore, early radio receivers had only to distinguish between the presence or absence of a radio signal. The device that performed this function in the receiver circuit was called a detector.J. A. Fleming, The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy and Telephony, London: Longmans, Green & Co., 1919, p. 364 A variety of different detector devices, such as the coherer, electrolytic detector, magnetic detector and the crystal detector, were used during the wireless telegraphy era until superseded by vacuum tube technology. After sound (amplitude modulation, AM) transmission began around 1920, the term evolved to mean a demodulator, (usually a vacuum tube) which extracted the audio signal from the radio frequency carrier wave. This is its current meaning, although modern detectors usually consist of semiconductor diodes, transistors, or integrated circuits. In a superheterodyne receiver the term is also sometimes used to refer to the mixer, the tube or transistor which converts the incoming radio frequency signal to the intermediate frequency. The mixer is called the first detector, while the demodulator that extracts the audio signal from the intermediate frequency is called the second detector. In microwave and millimeter wave technology the terms detector and crystal detector refer to waveguide or coaxial transmission line components, used for power or SWR measurement, that typically incorporate point contact diodes or surface barrier Schottky diodes. A coherer detector, useful only for Morse code signals.  Amplitude modulation detectors   Envelope detector  A simple envelope detector A simple crystal radio with no tuned circuit can be used to listen to strong AM broadcast signals One major technique is known as envelope detection. The simplest form of envelope detector is the diode detector that consists of a diode connected between the input and output of the circuit, with a resistor and capacitor in parallel from the output of the circuit to the ground to form a low pass filter. If the resistor and capacitor are correctly chosen, the output of this circuit will be a nearly identical voltage-shifted version of the original signal. An early form of envelope detector was the crystal detector, which was used in the crystal set radio receiver. A later version using a crystal diode is still used in crystal radio sets today. The limited frequency response of the headset eliminates the RF component, making the low pass filter unnecessary. More sophisticated envelope detectors include the grid-leak detector, the plate detector, the infinite-impedance detector, transistor equivalents of them and precision rectifiers using operational amplifiers.  Product detector  A product detector is a type of demodulator used for AM and SSB signals, where the original carrier signal is removed by multiplying the received signal with a signal at the carrier frequency (or near to it). Rather than converting the envelope of the signal into the decoded waveform by rectification as an envelope detector would, the product detector takes the product of the modulated signal and a local oscillator, hence the name. By heterodyning, the received signal is mixed (in some type of nonlinear device) with a signal from the local oscillator, to give sum and difference frequencies to the signals being mixed, just as a first mixer stage in a superhet would produce an intermediate frequency; the beat frequency in this case, the low frequency modulating signal is recovered and the unwanted high frequencies filtered out from the output of the product detector. Because the sidebands of an amplitude-modulated signal contain all the information in the carrier displaced from the center by a function of their frequency, a product detector simply mixes the sidebands down into the audible range so that the original audio may be heard. Product detector circuits are and so essentially ring modulators or synchronous detectors and closely related to some phase-sensitive detector circuits. They can be implemented using something as simple as ring of diodes or a single dual-gate Field Effect Transistor to anything as sophisticated as an Integrated Circuit containing a Gilbert cell. Product detectors are typically preferred to envelope detectors by shortwave listeners and radio amateurs as they permit the reception of both AM and SSB signals. They may also demodulate CW transmissions if the beat frequency oscillator is tuned slightly above or below the carrier.  Frequency and phase modulation detectors  AM detectors cannot demodulate FM and PM signals because both have a constant amplitude. However an AM radio may detect the sound of an FM broadcast by the phenomenon of slope detection which occurs when the radio is tuned slightly above or below the nominal broadcast frequency. Frequency variation on one sloping side of the radio tuning curve gives the amplified signal a corresponding local amplitude variation, to which the AM detector is sensitive. Slope detection gives inferior distortion and noise rejection compared to the following dedicated FM detectors that are normally used.  Phase detector  A phase detector is a nonlinear device whose output represents the phase difference between the two oscillating input signals. It has two inputs and one output: a reference signal is applied to one input and the phase or frequency modulated signal is applied to the other. The output is a signal that is proportional to the phase difference between the two inputs. In phase demodulation the information is contained in the amount and rate of phase shift in the carrier wave. The Foster-Seeley discriminator The Foster-Seeley discriminator, part 1. is a widely used FM detector. The detector consists of a special center-tapped transformer feeding two diodes in a full wave DC rectifier circuit. When the input transformer is tuned to the signal frequency, the output of the discriminator is zero. When there is no deviation of the carrier, both halves of the center tapped transformer are balanced. As the FM signal swings in frequency above and below the carrier frequency, the balance between the two halves of the center-tapped secondary is destroyed and there is an output voltage proportional to the frequency deviation. Ratio detector A ratio detector using solid-state diodes The ratio detectorReport L.B.-645: \\"Ratio detectors for FM receivers\\" (15 September 1945) issued by the Radio Corporation of America, RCA Laboratories Industry Service Division, 711 Fifth Avenue, N.Y., N.Y. Reprinted in Radio, pages 18-20 (October 1945). is a variant of the Foster-Seeley discriminator, but one diode conducts in an opposite direction, and using a tertiary winding in the preceding transformer. The output in this case is taken between the sum of the diode voltages and the center tap. The output across the diodes is connected to a large value capacitor, which eliminates AM noise in the ratio detector output. The ratio detector has the advantage over the Foster-Seeley discriminator that it will not respond to AM signals, thus potentially saving a limiter stage; however the output is only 50% of the output of a discriminator for the same input signal. The ratio detector has wider bandwidth but more distortion than the Foster-Seeley discriminator. Quadrature detector In quadrature detectors, the received FM signal is split into two signals. One of the two signals is then passed through a high-reactance capacitor, which shifts the phase of that signal by 90 degrees. This phase-shifted signal is then applied to an LC circuit, which is resonant at the FM signal's unmodulated, \\"center,\\" or \\"carrier\\" frequency. If the received FM signal's frequency equals the center frequency, then the two signals will have a 90-degree phase difference and they are said to be in \\"phase quadrature\\" ‚Äî hence the name of this method. The two signals are then multiplied together in an analog or digital device, which serves as a phase detector; that is, a device whose output is proportional to the phase difference between two signals. In the case of an unmodulated FM signal, the phase detector's output is ‚Äî after the output has been filtered; that is, averaged over time ‚Äî constant; namely, zero. However, if the received FM signal has been modulated, then its frequency will vary from the center frequency. In this case, the resonant LC circuit will further shift the phase of the signal from the capacitor, so that the signal's total phase shift will be the sum of the 90 degrees imposed by the capacitor, and the positive or negative phase change imposed by the LC circuit. Now the output from the phase detector will differ from zero, and in this way, one recovers the original signal that was used to modulate the FM carrier. This detection process can also be accomplished by combining, in an exclusive-OR (XOR) logic gate, the original FM signal and a square wave whose frequency equals the FM signal's center frequency. The XOR gate produces an output pulse whose duration equals the difference between the times at which the square wave and the received FM signal pass through zero volts. As the FM signal's frequency varies from its unmodulated center frequency (which is also the frequency of the square wave), the output pulses from the XOR gate become longer or shorter. (In essence, this quadrature detector converts an FM signal into a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal.) When these pulses are filtered, the filter's output rises as the pulses grow longer and its output falls as the pulses grow shorter. In this way, one recovers the original signal that was used to modulate the FM carrier. Other FM detectors Less common, specialized, or obsolescent types of detectors include:D. S. Evans and G. R.

Phase-locked loop detector The phase-locked loop detector requires no frequency-selective LC network to accomplish demodulation. In this system, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is phase locked by a feedback loop, which forces the VCO to follow the frequency variations of the incoming FM signal. The low-frequency error voltage that forces the VCO's frequency to track the frequency of the modulated FM signal is the demodulated audio output.

On the plane of the sky, it is located near the star Eta Geminorum. Its distance is roughly 5,000 light years from Earth. IC 443 may be the remains of a supernova that occurred 3,000 - 30,000 years ago. The same supernova event likely created the neutron star CXOU J061705.3+222127, the collapsed remnant of the stellar core. IC 443 is one of the best-studied cases of supernova remnants interacting with surrounding molecular clouds.  Global properties  WISE image of IC 443 IC 443 is an extended source, having an angular diameter of 50 arcmin (by comparison, the full moon is 30 arcmin across). At the estimated distance of 5,000 ly (1,500 parsec) from Earth, it corresponds to a physical size of roughly 70 light years (20 parsec). The SNR optical and radio morphology is shell-like (e.g. a prototypical shell-like SNR is SN 1006), consisting of two connected sub-shells with different centers and radii. A third, larger sub- shell‚Äîinitially attributed to IC 443‚Äîis now recognized as a different and older (100,000 years) SNR, called G189.6+3.3. Notably, IC 443 X-ray morphology is centrally peaked and a very soft X-ray shell is barely visible. Unlike plerion remnants, e.g. the Crab Nebula, the inner X-ray emission is not dominated by the central pulsar wind nebula. It has indeed a thermal origin. IC 443 shows very similar features to the class of mixed morphology SNRs. Both optical and X-ray emission are heavily absorbed by a giant molecular cloud in the foreground, crossing the whole remnant body from northwest to southeast. The remnant's age is still uncertain. There is some agreement that the progenitor supernova happened between 3,000 and 30,000 years ago. Recent Chandra and XMM-Newton observations identified a plerion nebula, close to the remnant southern rim. The point source near the apex of the nebula is a neutron star, relic of a SN explosion. The location in a star forming region and the presence of a neutron star favor a Type II supernova, the ultimate fate of a massive star, as the progenitor explosion.  The SNR environment  IC 443 wide field image. The stars Œ∑ (right) and Œº (left) Geminorum, the diffuse emission from S249 (north), and the G189.6+3.3 partial shell (center) are visible. The SNR IC 443 is located in the galactic anticenter direction (l=189.1¬∞), close to the galactic plane (b=+3.0¬∞). Many objects lie in the same region of sky: the HII region S249, several young stars (members of the GEM OB1 association), and an older SNR (G189.6+3.3). The remnant is evolving in a rich and complex environment, which strongly affects its morphology. Multi-wavelength observations show the presence of sharp density gradients and different cloud geometries in the surroundings of IC 443. Massive stars are known to be short lived (roughly 30 million years), ending their life when they are still embedded within the progenitor cloud. The more massive stars (O-type) probably clear the circum-stellar environment by powerful stellar winds or photoionizing radiation. Early B-type stars, with a typical mass between 8 and 12 solar masses, are not capable of this, and they likely interact with the primordial molecular cloud when they explode. Thus, it is not surprising that the SNR IC 443, which is thought to be the aftermath of a stellar explosion, evolved in such a complex environment. For instance, an appreciable fraction of supernova remnants lies close to dense molecular clouds (~50 out of 265 in the Green catalogueGreen, D. A (2006), \\"A Catalogue of Galactic Supernova Remnants (2006 April version)\\", Astrophysics Group, Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and most of them (~60%) show clear signs of interaction with the adjacent cloud. X-ray and the optical images are characterized by a dark lane, crossing IC 443 from northwest to southeast. Emission from quiescent molecular gas has been observed toward the same direction, and it is likely due to a giant molecular cloud, located between the remnant and the observer. This is the main source of extinction of the low energy SNR emission. In the southeast the blast wave is interacting with a very dense (~10,000 cm‚àí3) and clumpy molecular cloud, such that the emitting shocked gas has a ring-like shape. The blast wave has been strongly decelerated by the cloud and is moving with an estimated velocity of roughly 30‚Äì40 km s‚àí1. OH (1720 MHz) maser emission, which is a robust tracer of interaction between SNRs and dense molecular clouds, has been detected in this region. A source of gamma-ray radiation is spatially coincident with IC 443 and the maser emission region, though is not well understood whether it is physically associated with the remnant or not. In the northeast, where the brightest optical filaments are located, the SNR is interacting with a very different environment. The forward shock has encountered a wall of neutral hydrogen (HI), and is propagating into a less dense medium (~10-1,000 cm‚àí3) with a much higher velocity (80‚Äì100 km s‚àí1) than in the southern ridge. In the western region, the shock wave breaks out into a more homogeneous and rarefied medium.

His father was appointed professor of anatomy at Cambridge in 1883, and he was educated at The Perse School, and then studied at Cambridge University. Although his earliest interest was in the archaeology of Ireland, he soon developed a strong interest in biblical archaeology. Along with Frederick J. Bliss, he excavated several towns in the Shephelah region of Ottoman Palestine from 1898 to 1900. Using advances in stratigraphy building on the work of Flinders Petrie, they developed a chronology for the region using ceramic typology. Upon Bliss' retirement, Macalister became director of excavations for the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) in 1901. Line painted in 1900 (at top of image, marked \\"PEF\\") by Robert A.S. Macalister showing the level of the Dead Sea. From 1902 to 1909 he was responsible for the excavations at Gezer, in the modern state of Israel, just west of Jerusalem. This was one of the earliest large-scale scientific archaeological excavations in the region. The Gezer calendar found there is a very early paleo-Hebrew calendrical inscription. However, in most respects Macalister's work in Biblical archaeology is considered to have been a failure , due to the poor quality of his excavation techniques and his shoddy record-keeping . Because Macalister was the only professional archaeologist involved in the excavation, managing a project of such complexity was essentially an impossible task. Macalister left the field of Biblical archaeology in 1909 to accept a position as professor of Celtic archaeology at University College, Dublin, where he taught until his retirement in 1943. During this period, he worked at the ancient Irish royal site at the Hill of Tara and was responsible for editing the catalogue of all known ogham inscriptions from Great Britain and Ireland. Many of his translations of Irish myths and legends are still widely used today. He was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1910 and served as their president from 1926 to 1931. He was also president of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland from 1924 to 1928. He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his wife Margaret A. M.

It was similar to the recently approved Arizona Proposition 200 (2004), which denied public services to illegal aliens and California Proposition 187 (1994) which was declared unconstitutional by the Federal Appeals Court. Had DCN supporters collected the required number of petition signatures, the proposed amendment would be placed on the ballot for voter approval in November 2006. In Colorado, approximately 68,000 valid petition signatures are required to place a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot. The current registered agent for the Defend Colorado Now initiative is former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm, and its director is Fred Elbel, head of Colorado Alliance for Immigration Reform, which has been deemed a hate group by the SPLC. Ballot Title of the Defend Colorado Now Initiative The language of the ballot initiative is as follows: \\"[Shall there be] an amendment to the Colorado constitution concerning the restriction of non-emergency government services to certain persons who are lawfully present in the United States, and, in connection therewith, restricting the provision of non-emergency services by the State and local governments to United States citizens and aliens lawfully present in the United States, except as mandated by federal law; and providing for the implementation and enforcement of this restriction?\\" U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo first proposed the initiative in 2003 but was unable to get on the ballot due to a court challenge which limited the time needed to gather signatures. In response to the initiative, Keep Colorado Safe was formed to oppose the amendment, arguing that: 1) the amendment would do nothing to stem the flow of illegal immigration and 2) the proponents of the amendment have overstated the cost of providing such services. Current status On June 12, 2006, the Colorado Supreme Court issued a ruling on the DCN initiative stating that the initiative was not a single subject. This made the initiative ineligible for the November 2006 ballot. Petitions for rehearing were filed by Defend Colorado Now and by the Colorado Attorney General under the direction of Governor Bill Owens. On June 26, 2006, the Colorado Supreme Court denied the petitions for rehearing. On June 29, 2006, Governor Owens called a special legislative session to convene on July 6, 2006. Owens requested an emergency legislative session in order to vote on referring the initiative to the voters or pass a legislative bill similar to the DCN initiative. On July 11, 2006, the Colorado state legislature passed HB 1023, which limits state services to illegal aliens in Colorado. The bill embodies the essence of the DCN initiative.

It has grey to black ironbark, lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and conical fruit.buds and flowers fruit Description Eucalyptus fibrosa is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, grey to black, sometimes flaky ironbark from the base of the trunk to the thinner branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have petiolate, egg-shaped to more or less triangular or round leaves that are long, wide and a slightly lighter shade of green on one side. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the same shade of green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of seven, nine or eleven on a branching peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical to horn-shaped operculum. Flowering has been recorded in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical capsule long and wide with the valves close to rim level. Some other ironbarks occurring in the same area including E. siderophloia, E. rhombica and E. decorticans are similar but all have smaller buds and fruit, and a much shorter operculum than that of E. fibrosa. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus fibrosa was first formally described in 1859 by Victorian state botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859 from a collection from the Brisbane River and the description was published in Journal and Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet (fibrosa) apparently refers to the bark, although possibly an inappropriate name for an ironbark. In 1962, Lawrie Johnson and Robert Anderson described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus fibrosa F.Muell.subsp. fibrosa; * Eucalyptus fibrosa subsp. nubilis, (Maiden & Blakely) L.A.S.Johnson commonly known as the blue-leaved ironbark, differs from the autonym in having glaucous buds and fruit. This subspecies had previously been known as Eucalyptus nubilis Maiden & Blakely. Distribution and habitat Red ironbark grows in forest on shallow, relatively infertile soil. It is widespread on the coast, tablelands and nearby inland areas from near Rockhampton in Queensland to Moruya in New South Wales. Conservation This species is listed as \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.

History Allan Kaprow and Robert Watts, both key figures in the movement, originally met while they were students at Columbia University; though only together there for one year, soon after they both began teaching at Rutgers. George Brecht was working in New Brunswick, New Jersey when he saw the work of Robert Watts on display at the university. He was so impressed that he sought him out and they became friends. Claes Oldenburg referred to Allan Kaprow, George Segal, George Brecht, Robert Whitman, Robert Watts, Lucas Samaras, Geoffrey Hendricks and Roy Lichtenstein as the New Jersey School. George Segal and Allan Kaprow referred to it as the New Brunswick School of Painting. In the late 1950s, George Segal invited Allan Kaprow to go on a mushroom hunt with him and John Cage. Cage is remembered for his class in experimental composition, but he also taught mushroom identification. A discussion on the use of electronic sound recordings in art pieces led to Cage inviting Kaprow to his class. George Segal, Allan Kaprow, and Robert Watts all attended Cage's class. The first \\"happenings\\" Segal hosted annual picnics for his New York art friends. It was at one of these that Kaprow first coined the term Happening, for an impromptu artistic event, in the Spring of 1957. 'Happening' first appeared in print in the Winter 1958 issue of the Rutgers undergraduate literary magazine, Anthologist. The form was imitated and the term was adopted by artists across the United States, Germany, and Japan. Jack Kerouac referred to Kaprow as \\"the Happenings man,\\" and an ad showing a woman floating in outer space declared, \\"I dreamt I was in a happening in my Maidenform brassiere.\\" Other events Yam Festival George Brecht and Robert Watts would meet for lunch once a week at the Howard Johnson's in New Brunswick, they were occasionally joined by Geoffrey Hendricks. It was there that they planned the Yam Festival. While the festival was originally supposed to take place in Princeton at the suggestion of Bob Whitman, it ended up taking place at George Segals farm, on the Rutgers campuses, and in New York City. It was venue on May, 1963 to actions and Happenings by artists including Dick Higgins, Allan Kaprow, La Monte Young and Wolf Vostell who made the Happening TV-Burying in coproduction with the Smolin Gallery. Yam Festival was a year-long festival that took place between 1962 ‚Äì 1963. Yam is May backwards. Happenings included Yam Lecture, Yam Hat Sale, Water Day, Clock Day, Box Day and Yam Day. The Yam Festival Delivery Event was an early mail art piece. Orgies Mysteries Theater In 1970, Hermann Nitsch performed his Orgies Mysteries Theater at the round house on College Farm Road on the Cook College campus. A lamb was killed, skinned, disemboweled, and hung on a wall. Other happenings In 1968, Dick Higgins shot sheets of orchestral paper with a machine gun to create One Thousand Symphonies, which was later performed by Philip Corner. Geoffrey Hendricks performed The Sky is the Limit in the Voorhees Chapel in 1969. A 1970 Flux Fest at Douglass featured soccer played on stilts, a javelin event with a balloon replacing the javelin, and table tennis with holes in the center of the paddles or tin cans glued to the paddle. Today Watts taught at Rutgers for 31 years. Geoffrey Hendricks retired in 2003, after nearly 50 years at Rutgers. In 1999, Joan Marter published Off Limits: Rutgers University and the Avant-Garde, 1957-1963, which featured an exhibit of the same name at the Newark Museum. It won the International Association of Art Critics award for \\"Best Exhibition in a Museum Outside New York City.\\" In 2003, the art galleries at Mason Gross held Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia and Rutgers University, 1958-1972 to coincide with the release of a book by the same name by Geoffrey Hendricks. It featured artifacts from performances by Rutgers- affiliated Fluxus artists. The Flux Mass was re-staged that year on November 1 (in the same chapel as the original Flux Mass) as part of a series of performances to accompany the exhibition. The mass was also re-created at Amherst College. References Selected bibliography * Marter, Joan. Off Limits: Rutgers University and the Avant-Garde, 1957-1963.

He is a middle-order batsman for Tests and is an opening batsman in ODIs. Ryder also bowls useful medium-pace. Ryder has previously represented his country in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup of 2002. He played his domestic cricket with Wellington after crossing there from Central Districts in 2004 and is a member of their first-class and List A teams. In 2014 he had a successful county season for Essex County Cricket Club and returned in 2015. International career Early career On 30 January 2008, Ryder was chosen in the 12-man Twenty20 squad and the 13-man ODI squad to play England. New Zealand Cricket Selection Manager Richard Hadlee said \\"Jesse has the potential to provide an explosive start alongside Brendon McCullum at the top of the innings in both forms of the game.\\"BLACKCAPS squad announced Ex-cricketer Adam Parore subsequently hit out at the selector's decision to pick Ryder, claiming that he was \\"too fat\\" and \\"in no fit state to play for New Zealand.\\" Ryder's 2007/08 season ended on 24 February 2008 when he badly cut his hand trying to break into a toilet at a Christchurch bar at 5:30am the day after New Zealand had won the one day series against England.Ryder out of NZ Test contention, BBC News retrieved 24 February 2008 It was later revealed that Ryder had been drinking until 1:30 am the night before the fifth ODI against England (Ryder scored 24) and had been rude to staff at Christchurch hospital, demanding preferential treatment when he was being treated for his hand injury. Late career Ryder managed to get through the Indian tour without any further indiscretions. He was NZ's best batsman in the five ODIs, scoring 225 runs at an average of 56.25. He scored his first ODI century for New Zealand in the third match and was the man of the match in the fifth match for his all round performance, 3-29 and 63. His century (105) off 72 balls, was the third fastest ODI century for New Zealand. Ryder and McCullum enhanced their reputations as an opening partnership sharing two stands of over 100 in 4 innings, 166 in the third match and 102 in the 4th match.Why Ryder was a good investment In the second Test match at Napier, Ryder scored his maiden double century, (201) and put on 271 with Ross Taylor (151). This was a new record fourth wicket partnership against all countries and fourth highest test partnership ever for New Zealand. Ryder became the first New Zealander since Nathan Astle to score two centuries in two consecutive Test matches.New Zealand vs India 2nd Test, Napier, New Zealand, 26-30 March 2009 Ryder's contribution to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 tournament was limited. He scored 31 off 12 balls against Scotland but then picked up a \\"particularly nasty groin infection\\", played no further part in the competition and was replaced in the squad by Aaron Redmond. During the Indian first innings Ryder took the key wicket of Indian opener Gautam Gambhir. His return went well as he scored his third test century and his first outside New Zealand. This came while New Zealand were chasing a mammoth Indian first innings total of 429. He was engaged in a 194 run partnership with debutant Kane Williamson who finished the day on 87*. Ryder was given out lbw on the third ball of the final over of the third day; he scored 103. Injuries Ryder was injured from October 2009 to March 2010 and so did not play for New Zealand. In April 2010 he played a first class game for Wellington and scored 103. He was unable to make the August 2010 tour to Sri Lanka due to an elbow injury but was able to make the headlines on 7 August 2010 with yet another misconduct charge for intoxication.Ryder in trouble for late night noise Indefinite break from cricket On 8 March 2012, Ryder decided to take an indefinite break from international cricket following injury concerns and a prolonged history of disciplinary issues.Ryder takes indefinite break from cricket Cricinfo 8 March 2012 In December 2012 despite good form, scoring 162 from 174 balls against Central Districts on 11 December, Ryder said he was still not ready to return to international cricket.  Return to international cricket  Ryder returned to international cricket when he was called up to the ODI squad to face West Indies. On 1 January 2014, Ryder and Corey Anderson at the Queenstown Events Centre broke some records: Anderson broke Shahid Afridi's 17-year-old record of the fastest ODI hundred by one ball, scoring his in 36 balls; he eventually ended with an unbeaten 131 that featured 14 sixes and 6 fours. Along with Ryder, they helped New Zealand set the team record for the most sixes in an ODI innings. Ryder scored the sixth fastest century with 104 in 46 balls with 5 sixes. Record breaking In 2013 success, he was re-called to the Blackcaps side for the one day series against the West Indies on 19 December. During his first match at Eden Park Ryder scored a duck off 7 deliveries and did not bowl. With the second match at McLean Park, Napier being abandoned due to weather he went into the third match at Queenstown still having not scored a run. He responded in style hitting a century off 46 deliveries in a rain shortened 21 over match and along with Corey Anderson (who hit a world record 100 of 36 deliveries) put on over 200 runs for the 4th wicket in a final score of 283. Ryder enjoyed further success as the Blackcaps won the ODI series 4-1 and the T20 series 2‚Äì0. After the final one day international against the West Indies in Hamilton on 8 January when the Blackcaps lost the final game by an embarrassing 203 runs, Ryder was witnessed by a hotel guest looking the 'worse for wear' when returning to the hotel late at night after a drink with comedian Ben Hurley. How drunk he was at the time has been disputed and no action was taken at the time by New Zealand Cricket. No more indiscretions were reported and Ryder was duly selected for the Blackcaps side to play India for the five match one day international series beginning 19 January 2014. Ryder was unable to score past 20 in five innings. Personality issues On 7 January 2009, Ryder indulged in a \\"late night drinking session\\" after the 3rd ODI against the West Indies. He missed a team meeting the following morning and was unable to train in the afternoon. He was subsequently dropped for the 4th ODI. As Ryder had established a good record (Test Average: 49.33, ODI Average: 34.33) in his first season, New Zealand Cricket CEO Justin Vaughan was ready to help him with his drinking problem. Ryder played in the 5th ODI on 13 January 2009, and scored 21. Two days later, Justin Vaughan and Ryder's manager Aaron Klee announced that Ryder had agreed to go cold turkey. Ryder scored only 8 runs against South Africa, but in a must-win match for NZ against Sri Lanka he scored 74. When on 5 he pulled a leg abductor muscle and batted with a runner. Daniel Vettori, the New Zealand captain, felt the injury compelled Ryder to cut loose. \\"I just think he let out some frustration and it worked for us\\". He reached 50 in just 28 balls and scored his 74 off 58 balls. After being dismissed he whacked a chair with his bat and was fined 15% of his match fee for \\"abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings\\".Ryder out of Champions Trophy It was later revealed that the team manager, Dave Currie, gave Ryder a \\"dressing-down\\" for his behaviour and Ryder responded with a \\"tirade\\" of abuse, which resulted in misconduct charge on his return from South Africa. The hearing was held on 22 October 2009, on the same day Ryder was awarded the Redpath Cup. The punishment is not known. Further alcohol incidents emerged during the India series. Ryder was filmed by patrons in an intoxicated state with Jimmy Neesham outside the 1885 Bar in Auckland's Britomart just hours after the Blackcaps secured a dramatic tie against India at Eden Park. On 5 February 2014, just hours after being named as the backup to Ross Taylor (who was expecting his second child) for the first test match against India the next day, Ryder was seen drinking along with Doug Bracewell at a pirate themed party occurring at the Car Park bar with More FM radio personalities. It was reported that Ryder left the bar at 2am with the possibility of playing against India that very day. Their Blackcaps teammates were reportedly livid over the latest late night session and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) reacted furiously at the news. Ryder was subsequently dropped for the second test match against India beginning 14 February 2014 after this third incident. He was also omitted for the ICC T20 world cup to be held in Bangladesh during March on 'character grounds' due to his alcohol fueled indiscretions. Ryder returned to the Otago Volts to finish out the remainder of the New Zealand domestic series. His international career continued to remain in limbo when he was omitted from the side to tour the West Indies in July 2014, when it was announced on 15 April 2014. A statement from NZC said that Ryder had not satisfied the selectors that he had his off field issues under control. Christchurch bar attack  On 28 March 2013, it was reported by media, and later confirmed by police, that Ryder was in a critical condition at Christchurch Hospital after being assaulted outside the Aikman's Bar in Merivale, Christchurch in the early hours of that morning. It was reported that four men were involved in the attack, which spread from the bar into the carpark of the McDonald's restaurant across the street. It was reported that Ryder had suffered a fractured skull and a collapsed lung and was in a medically induced coma. However Ryder subsequently announced that his skull had not been fractured.Jesse Ryder: I'm fit to fight The New Zealand Herald, 11 February 2015. By 31 March, two men were charged with the assault, and Ryder was moved out of intensive care. In 2016 two men pleaded guilty to the assault: Craig Joseph O'Neill, 38, a builder, and his nephew Dylan James O'Neill, 22, a carpet layer.http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/65939966/jesse-ryders- christchurch-attackers-named New Zealand rapper Scribe made headlines when he suggested on his Twitter account that Ryder must have said something to prompt the attack. He later apologised for the remarks, and Ryder responded \\"Thanks again to everyone for the support esp my good mate Scribe. #NotManyIfAny\\". Lawyers for the two men accused of the attack, who received name suppression, said Ryder had only been punched once, and his injuries were nowhere near as severe as what had been reported, despite his being put into a coma. A man who posted video of Ryder's accused attackers on the internet was himself charged with breaching a suppression order. The man, Jordan Mason, pleaded guilty to uploading the clip to YouTube. Domestic career On 6 February 2009, just before the Indian series kicked off, Ryder's services were bought by the Bangalore Royal Challengers for $US160,000 ($NZ318,280).Ryder, Mills Secure IPL Contracts However, he struggled during the season, scoring a total of 56 runs, and was only chosen to play in 5 out of 16 of his team's games. Ryder also \\"fell off the wagon after 100 hard-fought days of sobriety\\", according to the NZ Herald. Ryder moved to the Otago Volts during the off season in 2013 citing a breakdown with his relationships with teammates at the Wellington Firebirds as the main reason. The move proved to be a success with Ryder scoring two centuries and two fifties upon his return from the doping ban between October and December 2013. Beginning in the 2014 English season, Ryder was contracted to play for Essex. He took 43 wickets in his first season, and 44 in the 2015 season. In November 2017, he scored his 25th century in first- class cricket, batting for Central Districts against Auckland in the 2017‚Äì18 Plunket Shield season.
